  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- Japan will change its laws 
if necessary to abide by any UN resolution calling for economic 
sanctions against North Korea for its refusal of full inspection 
of nuclear facilities, Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito said 
Thursday. "Japan will be remembered as an irresponsible country 
in future (if it does not implement sanctions)," Saito told a 
lecture meeing attended by more than 100 defense experts and 
business people. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) decided March 
21 to refer Pyongyang's refusal of full inspections of its 
nuclear facilities to the UN Security Council. Saito said Japan 
believes the Security Council will adopt a resolution next week 
calling on Pyongyang to accept full inspections of its nuclear 
facilities by the IAEA. 
  Japan will implement sanctions in line with the UN 
resolution 
within the framework of the war-renouncing Constitution, Saito 
said, adding that it will amend legislation, if necessary. 
  "It is the only way for Japan to take. Otherwise, Japan will 
not be able to dodge accusations that it is an irresponsible 
country," Saito said. 
  He said Japan hopes North Korea will retract its refusal to 
allow the IAEA to carry out full inspections. 
  He said China, a close ally of Pyongyang, wants the United 
States, South Korea and other countries concerned to resolve the 
issue through patient dialogue with North Korea. But Saito said 
"Japan does not think it is good to spend a long time."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- Japan still hopes North 
Korea will opt to remove suspicions that the communist country 
is secretly developing nuclear weapons, Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura said Thursday [24 March]. "We will continue 
to expect North Korea to take desirable steps in accordance with 
international opinion," the top government spokesman told a news 
conference. 
  Takemura also said Japan will keep in close touch with the 
United States and South Korea to exchange views on ways of 
tackling the growing threats arising from North Korea's 
suspected nuclear weapons development program. 
  While acknowledging that Tokyo's diplomatic channels to 
Pyongyang remain closed, Takemura noted that its Foreign 
Ministry is striving to find ways to persuade North Korea 
indirectly to remove the suspicions concerning its nuclear 
development program. 
  Earlier this week, the International Atomic Energy Agency 
adopted a resolution referring the issue of North Korea's 
refusal to accept full inspections to the UN Security Council, 
which may subsequently consider economic sanctions against 
Pyongyang. 
  North Korea slammed Japan on Wednesday for considering 
backing such sanctions, saying, "if seditious forces dare to put 
unreasonable pressure upon us in the form of `sanctions,' we 
would regard it as something equivalent to `a declaration of 
war'." 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will confer with South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam, who arrived in Tokyo on Thursday 
for a three-day stay, on possible ways to encourage North Korea 
to allay concerns that it is developing a nuclear weapon 
capability.

  [Text] Waikoloa, Hawaii, March 23 KYODO -- Japan agreed 
Wednesday to try to boost the share of U.S. chips in its market 
but said U.S. manufacturers must make more efforts to sell their 
products. 
  A regular two-day meeting on semiconductor trade in Hawaii 
ended with Japan partially agreeing with U.S. calls to help 
boost sales of its chips to the automobile, telecommunications 
and game equipment industries. Both sides agreed to promote 
cooperation on developing chips from the design stage. 
  The United States did not make any request for a new 
numerical target to measure the share of foreign chips in the 
Japanese market. 
  Foreign semiconductor makers won more than the targeted 20 
percent of the market, stipulated in an earlier agreement, in 
the final quarter of last year. 
  After the talks, however, U.S. Assistant Trade 
Representative 
Donald Phillips said that although he will not be asking for new 
numerical targets, a steady rise in U.S. market share is 
desirable. 
  The U.S. said large Japanese firms with a big need for 
semiconductors are not making an effort to buy U.S. chips. They 
called for Japanese automobile and telecoms firms such as Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) to be represented at the 
next round of talks. 
  Japan insisted that major users are fully cooperating in 
buying U.S. chips, and said U.S. makers are neglecting the 
Japanese market and instead concentrating on the growing U.S. 
domestic market.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- The just-concluded 
semiconductor trade talks between Japan and the United States 
were "constructive" in boosting the foreign share of the 
Japanese microchip market, a senior Trade Ministry official said 
Thursday. 
  Hideaki Kumano, vice minister at the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI), was referring to an 
accord on industrial cooperation between the two countries for 
increased foreign access to the Japanese semiconductor market. 
The agreement was reached during a two-day regular meeting in 
Hawaii that ended Wednesday. 
  Japan agreed to a U.S. request for Tokyo's efforts to help 
expand use of U.S.-made microchips by Japan's automobile, 
telecommunications and game equipment sectors. 
  The Japanese Government is prepared to encourage these 
industrial sectors to step up purchases of U.S. semiconductors, 
Kumano told a press conference. But he added that does not 
represent "any government guarantee" that the foreign share of 
Japan's market will stay above the benchmark 20 percent. 
  Kumano noted that the government does not ensure any results 
on ongoing voluntary efforts within the auto industry to expand 
purchases of U.S.-made auto parts and automobiles. 
  "It is impossible for the government to ensure results 
regarding private-sector matters," he said. 
  On Japan's restraints on car exports to the U.S., Kumano 
said 
MITI has yet to decide if it will extend the practice for fiscal 
1994 starting in April. U.S. officials have said there is no 
need for Japan to continue the restraints.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- Voluntary plans by the 
Japanese auto industry on purchases of U.S. auto parts and 
automobiles will be referred to in the government's 
market-opening package to be unveiled next week, a senior trade 
ministry official said Thursday [24 March]. 
  In the package, set for release Tuesday, the government will 
probably state it "welcomes" private-sector efforts to boost 
buying of U.S.-made auto components and automobiles, said the 
official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
He declined to be named. 
  But the reference does not mean the government will 
guarantee 
results for plans by each carmaker, the official added. 
  The package will be formulated as a way to resume failed 
"framework" trade talks between Japan and the United States. 
The two countries were unable to reach accord on "objective 
criteria" as a tool to measure Japan's imports.

<F P=106> ["News focus" by Keiji Urakami: "Japan Moving To Abolish </F>
Voluntary Auto Export Restraint"] 
  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- Japan is poised to scrap a 
voluntary cap on auto exports to the United States for fiscal 
1994 as the 13-year practice has become a white elephant. 
Speculation that Tokyo will not extend the voluntary export 
restraint arrangement beyond the current year to March grew 
after Japan's trade minister recently made remarks in favor of 
terminating the system. 
  The auto industry also sounds reluctant to maintain what it 
views as a practice against free trading. 
  Moreover, Washington does not regard the practice as a 
useful 
tool any more for reducing its huge trade deficit with Tokyo, at 
a time when U.S.-bound Japanese car exports have slipped below 
annual ceilings in recent years. 
  "The U.S. Administration of Bill Clinton basically does not 
support the auto export quota system," said Hiroshi Kumagai, 
international trade and industry minister. "If the practice is 
preserved for another year from April, Tokyo may face 
accusations from the U.S. that it is forming a cartel," the 
trade minister said. 
  Japan began to set annual car export limits in 1981 as a way 
to ease trade frictions with Washington. 
  In the first year, Japanese carmakers shipped a total of 
1.68 
million vehicles to the U.S., a volume that was exactly the same 
as that year's ceiling. Export records in the next five years 
also filled ceilings that were raised to as many as 2.3 million 
vehicles by 1985 in response to brisk Japanese shipments. 
  But auto exports to the U.S., after turning lower in 1987, 
are on the decline, chiefly due to increased production by 
Japanese makers at their U.S. plants in the wake of the yen's 
sharp gain against the dollar. 
  As a result, shipments have been below set limits in the 
past 
six years despite the gradual lowering of ceilings, finally to 
1.65 million vehicles from fiscal 1992. Last year, exports 
totaled 1.57 million vehicles against the 1.65 million vehicle 
limit. 
  For the current year, the situation remains unchanged. 
Toyota Motor Corp., for example, expects its U.S.-bound 
shipments to sink below its quota, a Toyota spokesman said. 
"Car shipments to the U.S. will further drop next year, 
affected by the operation from March this year of the second 
Kentucky plant," the spokesman said. 
  Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota, said, "Japanese makers' 
car exports to the U.S. in a manner of a local torrential 
downpour as seen in the past are unlikely to take place in the 
future." 
  Washington appears to have no objection to Japan not 
extending the current voluntary restraint arrangement expiring 
within a week. Undersecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten said, 
"This is not an issue for us any more." 
  It would be "a waste of time" for Tokyo to think that 
keeping 
the practice would appease Washington in trade disputes, said 
Garten. 
  Japan has other reasons to end the voluntary auto export 
curb. 
  New trade frameworks established under the recently 
concluded 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) call for practices 
like voluntary export restraints to be phased out in four years. 
Such trade practices are what the government of Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa is adamantly against under its major policy 
goal of deregulating government controls. 
  The stance is also in conformity with Japan's opposition to 
managed trade, a concept Tokyo rejected repeatedly in its trade 
"framework" talks with the U.S. 
  Auto industry observers think the latest remarks by Garten 
may signal Washington's preparedness not to raise objections to 
Tokyo's decision to terminate the export practice. But MITI 
appears very guarded about showing new commitments on the issue, 
voicing fears over possible repercussions on the bilateral trade 
front at a time when economic ties are in a sensitive phase 
following the February 11 breakdown of the trade talks between 
Hosokawa and Clinton. 
  Hideaki Kumano, vice MITI minister, told Thursday's press 
conference that MITI Minister Kumagai's recent comment on the 
issue should not be taken as showing any policy change by Tokyo. 
  "The trade minister just stated his general impression of 
Washington's attitude toward the issue," Kumano said. "MITI is 
still uncommitted about whether or not to extend the trade 
practice next year." 
  Auto industry leaders also fear any new commitments from 
their own side for now may create unnecessary sources of 
contention with the U.S. 
  Yutaka Kume, chief of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers 
Association, said, "The industry wants the auto trade practice 
to wither away and disappear without noticing it." 
  MITI is likely to postpone its announcement on the issue 
beyond the March 31 end of the current year, industry observers 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- Japan expressed regret on 
Thursday [24 March] at the assassination of a Mexican 
presidential candidate on Wednesday in Tijuana, near the U.S. 
border, during an election campaign. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada issued a 
statement 
calling the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio an 
"unfortunate incident" and offered condolences. The statement 
said if the incident was an act of political terrorism, it is a 
challenge to Mexico's democracy and all the more regrettable as 
Japan has been supporting Latin American nations' efforts to 
become democratic. 
  Colosio was shot in the head and the abdomen around 5 P.M. 
shortly after finishing a campaign speech in a poor area of 
Tijuana. He died later in the evening. 
  Colosio, 44, was the candidate of the ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI) in presidential elections scheduled 
for August.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- Bank of Japan [BOJ] 
Governor Yasushi Mieno said Thursday [24 March] the domestic 
economy is improving, but more time is needed for the country to 
crawl out of the adjustment phase. 
  Consumption and corporate production are recuperating and 
corporate sentiment is improving, but capital investment is 
still declining and the labor situation is deteriorating, he 
said in a speech in Tokyo. He even cautioned that recent bright 
spots in the economy could have been brought about by factors 
concerning the fiscal year-end this month. 
  Mieno added that Japan will have to wait a little longer for 
stock adjustments to be completed. He went on to say that the 
capability of private enterprises and financial institutions to 
manage risks is weakening, and called for the further 
introduction of a competitive environment within the industry. 
  The governor warned that financial institutions are not 
operating entirely in line with basic market principles and a 
risk control that lacks such fundamentals may even result in 
greater insecurity. 
  Further liquidation of nonperforming assets by financial 
institutions is indispensible for recovery of the Japanese 
economy, Mieno said. 
  Referring to the recent rise in long-term interest rates, 
the 
governor said this appeared to be a reaction to overheated 
expectations of lower interest rates triggered by a recovery in 
Japanese stock prices. 
  Mieno said any excessive movement of the rates is likely to 
be corrected in line with the realities of business conditions. 
With respect to efforts to beef up Japan's financial system, 
Mieno noted the need to improve methods of settlement, in 
addition to changes in corporate accounting and the tax system.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- Bank of Japan governor 
Yasushi Mieno chided the country's financial institutions 
Thursday [24 March] for having a "pack" mentality, urging more 
competition for the sector. In a Tokyo speech, Mieno said that 
the long recession after the collapse of the late 1980s 
speculative bubble highlights the dangers of the financial 
industry concentrating its lending in one area, such as real 
estate. 
  Mieno said private risk-management ability has weakened, 
citing a financial sector tendency "to use industry averages as 
a benchmark and stay in the pack," unaware that "ill-managed 
behavior in one corner can spread risk through the sector." 
  Noting competition-forced innovations in domestic industries 
such as autos and electronics, the central bank chief said most 
financial sector improvements have been copied from abroad, and 
asked "why is it that innovation is hard to come by for Japanese 
financial institutions?" 
  Reforms needed to strengthen the financial sector center on 
letting the market more effectively drive financial institutions 
to seek profits while shareholders and other market players 
discipline "excessive behavior," Mieno said. 
  He praised December's Hiraiwa Commission report calling for 
deregulation, called on institutions to improve their risk 
management procedures and urged beefing up of such financial 
"infrastructure" as accounting and disclosure systems. 
  Regulation and surpervision remain essential to "embed moral 
standards in financial institutions," but regulations focus 
heavily on risks while the market constantly balances risks with 
rewards, Mieno said. 
  The concentration on real estate-related lending in the 
bubble era has left financial institutions saddled with huge 
nonperforming assets, which they must write off to allow full 
recovery, Mieno said. He repeated that adjustments need not be 
complete for recovery to begin but said they will continue to 
retard a return to full-throttle growth. 
  Bright spots continue to emerge, but more time is needed for 
stock and balance sheet adjustments and responses to increasing 
international competition, he said. 
  Mieno noted that some areas of consumption and industrial 
production are brightening but said capital spending and labor 
conditions continue to worsen. He cautioned that such recent 
signs as higher output from mines and factories somewhat reflect 
a typical surge toward the end of the fiscal year in March. 
  "Conditions are falling in place for a better-balanced 
growth," but some excess capacity run up in the bubble days may 
never be fully used, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- The Telecommunications 
Council on Thursday [24 March] advised Posts and 
Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki to take steps to 
encourage free competition among three Japanese long-distance 
telecommunications service companies. The panel gave its advice 
to Kanzaki in granting charge cut applications by Japan Telecom 
Co., DDI Corp. and Teleway Japan Corp., as the three companies 
all planned the same reduction and sought approval for their 
plans. 
  At the moment, conditions are not ripe for free competition 
among the firms because of continued quasimonopolistic control 
by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), the council said. 
  The three firms all proposed an average 12.3 percent cut in 
the general leased circuit charge for new medium-distance 
categories. The three companies also sought approval for an 
average 10.3 percent cut in their high-speed digital 
transmission service charges. 
  However, the council recommended to the minister that the 
proposed charge reduction plans be approved without revision. 
The rate cuts will be put into effect on April 1.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- The finance minister has 
no new offers on macroeconomic measures for Japan's trade 
package to be compiled by the end of the month, a senior 
ministry official said Thursday [24 March]. 
  "There were no specific talks on macroeconomic 
measures...and 
we can't offer something new" regarding permanent tax cuts or 
boosting public works spending, Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito 
told a scheduled news conference. Saito was referring to an 
earlier meeting he attended at the Diet between Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. 
  The government has promised to enact tax measures by the end 
of the year. Steps envisaged include a permanent cut in income 
taxes and raising indirect levies such as the consumption tax. 
The government has also said it will consider boosting its 
10-year 430 trillion yen public works spending program if 
funding can be secured. 
  Takemura told a separate news conference that he wants to 
include "direction" of macroeconomic measures in the March 
package, but details will take until June to work out. But the 
chief government spokesman said he "fully recognizes" the 
ministry's "unchanged" cautious macroeconomic stance. 
  Saito said the meeting covered only "general discussions," 
adding, "you (reporters) shouldn't speculate."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- A lower house committee on 
Thursday [24 March] approved a proposal for major tax cuts in 
1995 and beyond to follow the planned cuts for 1994. 
  Finance committee directors of the House of Representatives 
approved the proposal to add to the special income tax reduction 
bill a provision calling for further income tax cuts in 1995 and 
beyond. The proposal was made by the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) in an amendment to the bill submitted to 
the committee earlier in the day. 
  The current bill calls for an income tax reduction only for 
1994. 
  The amendment is due for approval at a lower house plenary 
session on Friday evening. 
  The ruling coalition earlier agreed to decide on a sweeping 
tax reform plan, including additional income tax cuts, by the 
end of the year.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- Private railway unions on 
Thursday [24 March] threatened a 24-hour strike Friday affecting 
more than 22 million people if they fail to resolve their 
differences with management over demands for a wage increase. 
The companies are asking their unions to accept a benchmark 
monthly wage increase of 10,800 yen, but the unions are pushing 
for a 4 percent increase of 11,600 yen. 
  Late Thursday evening it was still unclear whether 
last-minute talks would avert a strike. 
  Bus services by nine companies and train services by 12 
companies could affect some 22,100,000 people. In the Kanto 
region centered on Tokyo they include the Tobu, Tokyu, Keisei 
railway lines and lines operated by Teito Rapid Transit 
Authority, Keio Teito, and Sagami Railway, and in the Chubu 
region centered on Nagoya, the Nagoya Railroad Union. 
  In the Kansai region centered on Osaka and Kyoto they 
include 
the Hankyu, Hanshin, Keihan, and Nankai railway lines, and in 
Kyushu the Nishi Nippon Railroad lines.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- Key industries on Thursday 
[24 March] offered wage hikes this year that are the lowest 
since the end of World War II amid the prolonged economic slump, 
labor unions said. The Japanese Trade Union Confederation 
(Rengo), Japan's largest umbrella of trade unions, said the 
steel, automobile, shipbuilding and heavy machinery, and 
electrical machinery industries offered wage hikes of between 
1.56 percent and 3.3 percent. 
  The level of wage increases to be attained by the four key 
industries is regarded as a pacesetter for other industries in 
wage negotiations. 
  Unions of the steel, automobile, and shipbuilding and heavy 
machinery industries accepted the offer. 
  If the unions accept the offer, the average margin of wage 
hikes of the major industries will be at the lower half of the 3 
percent level, falling below the previous low of 3.5 percent in 
1987. At that time, the country's export-driven economy 
suffered setbacks due to the yen's appreciation brought about by 
the 1985 Plaza Accord among major industrialized countries to 
engineer a stronger yen, Labor Ministry officials said. 
  Unions of nine electric power companies accepted a hike of 
9,950 yen per month, or 3.05-3.14 percent, down from 12,100 yen 
last year. 
  Major private railway unions, which threaten to stage a 
24-hour strike on Friday, are expected to call off the strike 
after management offered a hike of 11,400 yen, or 3.94 percent, 
in negotiations Thursday night. 
  Most unions, pressed to choose between jobs and wage hikes 
under the recession, are expected to accept the proposals to 
secure jobs, labor officials said. 
  Five major steelmakers jointly proposed a hike of 1.56 
percent, or 4,500 yen per month. The previous year's wage hike 
was 2.65 percent, or 7,500 yen. The steelmakers are Nippon 
Steel Corp., NKK Corp., Kawasaki Steel Corp., Sumitomo Metal 
Industry Ltd., and Kobe Steel Ltd. 
  Nippon Steel was the only one of the five not to skip 
dividends to shareholders in the 1993 business year ending March 
31. 
  Seventeen major electrical machinery firms, meanwhile, 
proposed raising wages by a uniform 3.05 percent, against the 
labor demand for a 3.2 percent hike. 
  The firms' unions, which threatened a 12-hour strike from 
Friday noon, are expected to accept the offer. 
  Among the 17 were Hitachi Ltd., Toshiba Corp., Matsushita 
Electric Industrial Co., Mitsubishi Electric Corp., NEC Corp. 
and Fujitsu Ltd. 
  In the automobile industry, Toyota Motor Corp. proposed a 
hike of 3.06 percent, or an average 9,200 yen, in monthly wages. 
Negotiating sessions between management and unions are expected 
to settle on this level even though the unions have demanded a 
rise of 5 percent, or 9,600 yen, Toyota officials said. 
  Nissan Motor Co. offered its workers a hike of 2.89 percent, 
or 8,400 yen. 
  Managements of seven leading shipbuilders proposed 
increasing 
wages by a uniform 3.3 percent, or 9,700 yen per month, 
officials said. 
  Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of 
Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), said that the wage proposals 
reflected a "wise choice" of both management and labor to place 
priority on jobs.

  [Text] Niigata, March 24 KYODO -- The Niigata District 
Court on Thurday [24 March] turned down a suit seeking a halt to 
a 1977 government decision that allowed a power utility firm to 
build a nuclear power plant in the sea of Japan coast city of 
Kashiwazaki, Niigata Prefecture. The three-judge panel said it 
could not find reason to necessitate the cancellation of the 
permission by the minister of international trade and industry. 
  The court acted on the suit filed in 1979 by a group of 282 
residents who questioned the safety of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa 
nuclear power plant, which was built by Tokyo Electric Power Co. 
  The plaintiffs demanded the annulment of the permission, 
citing a geologists' report that they had discovered an 
enlarging fracture of the surface of the land that consists of 
layers of sandstone and mudstone. The crustal fracture is known 
among geologists as the terao fault. 
  While the court case dragged on over 15 years, Tokyo 
Electric 
Power completed the installation of five nuclear reactors in the 
complex. Four of the five are now in operation and construction 
of two more reactors is under way. 
  If the additional two are completed, the complex would rank 
among the world's largest nuclear power plants by having an 
aggregate power-generating capability of 8,210 megawatts. 
  Presiding Judge Yukio Ota said in the ruling, "there is no 
sufficient evidence that would substantiate a hypothesis that 
the terao fault resulted from some problems in the geological 
structure." The ruling went on to say, "there are no serious 
mistakes in the judgment of the government which concluded that 
the firmness of the ground supporting the power plant cannot be 
eroded by a possible movement of the earth's crust." 
  The plaintiffs also argued that the power company has not 
taken sufficient safety measures to prevent a possible calamity 
like the 1986 reactor meltdown in Chernobyl, then in the Soviet 
Union, or the 1979 accident at the Three-Mile Island power plant 
in the United States. The judge said the government's 
recognition of the safety of the design of the Kashiwazaki plant 
cannot be questioned, as the nuclear disasters in Chernobyl and 
Three-Mile Island stemmed from mistakes in operation management 
or defective design of the nuclear reactors. 
  The ruling, however, recognized the plaintiffs' assertion 
that the government's safety standard was too lenient. 
  The safety standard at the time stipulated that the 
tolerable 
dosage of exposure of residents to radiation from the nuclear 
plant was 0.5 roentgen equivalent man (rem) per year. In 1989 
the standard was tightened to 0.1 rem. 
  The ruling said, "at present, the court questions the 
rationale of the tolerable radiation exposure figure of 0.5 rem 
for the public, which was used by the government in examining 
the safety of the plant in this case." Yoki Kawada, director 
general of the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, said, 
"the ruling that recognized the assertions of the government on 
this case was appropriate and the government will continue to 
expedite the development and use of nuclear power plants."

  [Text] On the 39th founding anniversary of the Lao 
People's Revolutionary Party [LPRP] on 22 March, on behalf of 
the Communist Party and people of Vietnam, we would like to 
extend our fraternal and intimate goodwill and best wishes to 
you, comrades, and multiethnic people. 
  Under the clear-sighted and talented leadership of the LPRP, 
for the past 39 years, the multiethnic Lao people have held 
aloft the spirit of patriotism, overcome numerous difficulties 
and trials, and scored successive and important achievements in 
national liberation, national defense, and national construction 
and comprehensive restructuring. Laos' economic foundations 
have made impressive advancement, while the living conditions of 
the multiethnic people have improved. The political 
stability of the country has been steadily maintained and the 
national defense and public security maintenance work has been 
further consolidated. As a result, the influence of the Lao 
People's Democratic Republic has been further elevated in this 
region and the world over. These successes have made noble 
contributions to the common struggle for peace, independence, 
democracy, and social progress of the world's people. The 
Communist Party and people of Vietnam would like to extend our 
wholehearted congratulations to the Lao people for having won 
such glorious victories. For this exuberant celebration, we 
hope that the Lao people will further expand their glorious 
revolutionary traditions by uniting with one another to carry 
out the comprehensive restructuring in accordance with the 
resolution adopted at the Fifth LPRP Congress, thereby 
fulfilling the task of building Laos with peace, independence, 
democracy, unification, and prosperity. The Communist Party and 
people of Vietnam are very proud and grateful to the LPRP and 
multiethnic people for you, our intimate comrades, have always 
stood side by side and wholeheartedly supported the Vietnamese 
revolution. 
  May the relations of friendship, special solidarity, and 
comprehensive cooperation between our two parties and peoples be 
continuously and more effectively developed to conform to the 
realities and capabilities of each country in the interests of 
peace and development of our two countries and other countries 
in the region and the world.

  [Text] AUSTRALIA has expressed interest in acceding to the 
ASEAN's Treaty of Amity and Co-operation (TAC) in talks with 
Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, according to a Foreign 
Ministry statement yesterday. 
  Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans raised the issue 
during his meeting with Prasong, who is on three-day official 
visit to Australia. 
  Prasong had said he would raise the matter the other members 
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Brunei, 
Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, and Malaysia -- the 
statement said. It gave no further details. 
  Australia is already a dialogue partner of ASEAN. Acceding 
to the Treaty of Amity and Co-operation in Southeast Asia (TAC) 
would be a necessary step towards membership of the regional 
grouping. However, ASEAN leaders cannot agree on the need to 
expand the 1976- Bali treaty to include countries outside 
Southeast Asia. 
  The treaty calls for the peaceful settlement of regional 
conflict and provides for setting up a high council to settle 
disagreements. Some ASEAN states fear the council could be 
dominated by non- Southeast Asian regional players if they are 
allowed to accede to the treaty. 
  Priority is clearly being given to links with the other 
Southeast Asian nations: Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Burma. 
  Laos and Vietnam have observer status and have already 
acceded to the treaty. The United Nations in 1992 adopted 
resolutions endorsing the TAC's guidelines and principles as a 
code of conduct for relations between countries in the region 
and as a mechanism to settle disputes. 
  The statement said Evans also proposed that the first 
meeting 
of the ASEAN Regional Forum [ARF] discuss the setting up of two 
or three working groups. 
  It said Evans and Prasong agreed that the first ARF meeting 
should promote friendliness and confidence-building among the 18 
attending foreign ministers as a foundation for co-operation in 
ensuring peace and stability.

  [Text] Fiji says it could rejoin the Commonwealth as soon 
as early as next year. The South Pacific correspondent, Erina 
Reddan, reports that Fiji's newly elected government wants to 
rejoin the Commonwealth and reestablish diplomatic links with 
India. 
  [Begin Reddan recording] Fiji left the Commonwealth in the 
wake of two military coups in 1987 which overthrew an 
Indo-Fijian dominated government. It broke off diplomatic links 
with India in 1989 after accusing an embassy staffer of 
interfering in local politics. Now elected for a second term as 
prime minister, one-time coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka says he 
wants a new era of racial harmony between Fijians and 
Indo-Fijians. The racist constitution which guarantees Fijians' 
political dominance over Fiji Indians must be reviewed by 1997. 
The spokesperson, (Jauna Nakabua), says it could be well enough 
on the way by 1995 to satisfy the Commonwealth that it meets its 
protection of human rights principles. [end recording]

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan has 
emphasised to senior Cambodian officials here that there is no 
need to call on international organisations to help Cambodians 
who fled into Thailand recently. 
  Mr Surin met Minister of State for National Rehabilitation 
Keat Chhon and Under-Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs 
Ung Sean and Pok Marina shortly after arriving here for a 
three-day visit. 
  Mr Surin did not meet Foreign Minister Norodom Sirivut 
yesterday as planned because the prince had left suddenly for 
Beijing on Tuesday to brief King Norodom Sihanouk on the 
situation in Pailin, a diplomatic source said. 
  But Prince Sirivut is expected back in Phnom Penh today and 
the two may still meet here before the prince pays a visit to 
Bangkok next week. 
  The Khmer Rouge yesterday said Pailin remained under their 
control. 
  Mr Surin stressed to those he did meet here yesterday that 
the refugee situation at the Thai-Cambodian border is now under 
control. 
  He maintained there is no need to call for international 
help 
since Cambodia now has a government that could look after its 
own people. 
  Mr Surin on Tuesday inspected the border village of Ban 
Pakkad where an estimated 25,000 Cambodians fleeing from 
fighting in nearby Pailin have sought refuge. 
  Mr Surin reiterated Thailand's readiness to discuss with the 
Cambodian Government overlapping claims in the Gulf of Thailand 
before launching any joint development projects. 
  "If they are ready to talk, we're ready. It would be good if 
(they) have a delegation to Bangkok as quickly as possibly to 
begin the discussion," he said. 
  "The same message will be given to Prince Sirivut when he 
visits Bangkok on Monday," Mr Surin said. 
  Mr Surin said he noted during yesterday's discussions that 
Thailand would like to discuss fishery issues in a separate 
forum. 
  He also requested an extension of the March 31 deadline set 
for the transport of felled logs and mining equipment from 
Cambodia to Thailand. 
  "Because of the fighting, the removal is very difficult. We 
hope Cambodia will reconsider the deadline and hope the issue 
will be discussed when Prince Sirivut comes to Thailand," Mr 
Surin said.

  [Text] A joint ministerial meeting was held at 0900 on the 
morning of 23 March at the Cabinet's office chaired by Samdech 
Hun Sen, second prime minister of the Royal Government of 
Cambodia [RGC]. 
  The joint ministerial meeting focused on strengthening the

control of Pailin at 1800 on 19 March. The meeting also outlined 
a number of urgent principles, targets, and measures to control 
Pailin, which had been under the Khmer Rouge since the end of 
1989. The Khmer Rouge had used this area as their autonomous 
zone and center for carrying out illegal economic exploitation 
to continue the war, carrying on the massacre, and creating 
insecurity for the Cambodian people throughout the country. In 
this connection: 
  1. The meeting discussed, examined, and determing a number 
of measures to cope with the resettlement of the people who will 
settle in the Pailin area and provide them with security; 
  2. The meeting reiterated the RGC's determination to 
rearrange the Pailin area by sending the people to settle there. 
The government also plans to develop this area. 
  3. The meeting decided in principle to set up measures to 
bring back the Cambodian people who had fled the Kingdom of 
Thailand when the KRAF launched its attack to drive the Khmer 
Rouge out of Pailin. 
  4. The meeting believed that the various foreign businessmen 
and companies which formerly dealt in gems and logs with the 
Khmer Rouge would definitely stop having contacts with the Khmer 
Rouge. At the same time, the RGC solemnly declared its 
recognition of all the agreements. [sentence as heard] The 
meeting ended at 1030 in a spirit of unity and (?responsibility).

<F P=106> [Commentary by Seiha: "When Pailin Is Captured"] </F>
  [Text] Pailin fell into the hands of the royal government 
at 1800 on 19 March. No one in Phnom Penh could hear the 
clandestine Khmer Rouge radio transmission anymore. However, 
most people believe that "the Khmer Rouge problem is not over 
yet." 
  According to a preliminary report, only 22 Khmer Rouge 
soldiers have been shot dead in fighting at Bar Ya Kha, mid-way 
between Pailin town and the Thai border. Where then have the 
many other Khmer Rouge troops been hiding? 
  The loss of Pailin certainly puts an end to the considerable 
inflow of revenue for the Khmer Rouge. But it does not mean 
that the Khmer Rouge have been economically strangled. The 
Khmer Rouge still possess several hundred million dollars in 
stocks abroad, especially in Thailand, and they also hold large 
amounts of shares in various Thai companies. 
  Therefore, the remaining Khmer Rouge troops of about 9,000 
and their economic assets will enable them to carry on their 
activities, and whenever the forces of the royal government 
lapse, the Khmer Rouge will strike back. 
  Nevertheless, the capture of Pailin by the royal government 
forces is a big blow to the Khmer Rouge. It will force them to 
get out of the trenches and return to the negotiating table. 
Foreign analysts have said that if negotiations are still 
deadlocked the negotiations are still deadlocked up to this 
point, the royal government must be prepared to be immersed in a 
general guerrilla warfare with the Khmer Rouge. If this were 
the case, the Khmer Rouge would become the most urgent problem 
for the royal government to solve. 
  If this were the case, the royal government should 
immediately declare the Khmer Rouge outlaws. Then, all the 
assets of the Khmer Rouge would also be outlawed and all 
countries would have the obligation to return these assets to 
the legal government as in the case of the United States, which 
has agreed to return the amassed fortune of Marshal Lon back to 
the royal government. Only then will the Khmer Rouge be truly 
strangled.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "FUNCINPEC is Thirteen Years Old"] </F>
  [Text] The FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an 
Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] Party 
marked its 13th anniversary on 21 March by emphasizing that its 
victory in the May 1993 elections is a historic achievement. 
  In fact, FUNCINPEC is not the most powerful party of the 
tripartite coalition government, despite its speedy expansion 
within a short period of time prior to the polls. However, this 
quantitative growth has brought about many great difficulties 
for the party to iron out. 
  On top of these problems, FUNCINPEC now faces scores of 
diverse tendencies among its members. Analysts believe that the 
tendency to regard the alliance between the Cambodian People's 
Party [CPP] and the FUNCINPEC Party as a political ploy is a 
dangerous way of thinking. Of late, the CPP seems to have shown 
its utmost apprehension over this tendency; it has become more 
vigilant than ever before. 
  Analysts maintain that there are indications now that this 
alliance is facing problems and this is probably explained by a 
series of secret visits to Beijing made by the two party leaders 
recently. 
  Nevertheless, without talking about the CPP accusations 
during the election last year, the FUNCINPEC Party's inability 
to win a majority in the polls demands that it makes further 
all-out efforts in the second legislative election to be held in 
the next few years, though election results are unpredicatable. 
The best way for the FUNCINPEC Party is that it should do its 
utmost to bring different government plans and programs to 
success. It is not wise at all for the party to strive to knock 
down the CPP, its political partner.

  [Text] Jakarta, Mar 23 (ANTARA) -- The North Korean 
Government expressed gratitude to Indonesia for its positive 
stand regarding its row on nuclear issue with the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  "We express gratitude to the Indonesian Government whose 
positive attitude towards our stand on the nuclear issue gives 
us some support," North Korean Ambassador to Indonesia Han 
Pong-ha said at a press conference here on Wednesday. 
  Han was responding to President Suharto's recent statement 
urging North Korea's conflict with IAEA, particugarly the United 
States, to be settled in a peaceful way. 
  According to the North Korean ambassador, Indonesia, being 
the chairman of the Non-aligned Movement, has shown 
encouragement in defending the interests of developing countries. 
  He appreciated Indonesia's opposition towards IAEA's plan to 
bring the North Korean nuclear issue to the United Nations 
Security Council for its settlement. 
  Indonesia rejects the idea on the grounds that the issue 
should be settled in a dialogue between the country involved and 
the IAEA, Ambassador Han said. 
  The conflict between North Korea and IAEA, particularly with 
the United States, began when North Korea rejected earlier the 
nuclear international body's inspection team to observe its 
nuclear facilities. 
  North Korea withdrew its Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) 
membership on March 1993 but later deferred the withdrawal after 
conducting talks with the United States. 
  Han threatened that his country will withdraw its NPT 
membership if the United States continues to break the agreement 
signed by both sides in New York last February 25, 1994. 
  According to Han, under the agreement, the United States, 
announced the suspension of the "Team Spirit '94" -- a joint 
military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea -- and that 
it would set a date of the opening of third round of North 
Korea-U.S. talks. 
  "However, the United States said it would keep the promise 
only after the inspection of IAEA had been made satisfactory and 
special envoys are exchanged between the North and the South," 
he added. 
  The ambassador also disclosed that the meeting agreed on 
four 
steps of simultaneous action for a package solution to the 
nuclear issue, including the suspension of the "Team Spirit 
'94", resumption of the working level meetings, acceptance of 
the IAEA inspection and holding of the third round of U.S.-North 
Korea talk. 
  The ambassador said that North Korea has accepted the IAEA's 
inspectors. It has held several rounds of working level 
meetings and made every possible efforts for an early exchange 
of special envoys. 
  "But the U.S. side has fulfilled none of its obligations," 
he 
said, adding that, "if the U.S. continues to break the 
agreement we will withdraw our NPT membership."

  [Text] Probolinggo, Mar 23 (ANTARA) -- President Suharto 
reiterated Wednesday that Indonesia will be firm in refusing 
foreign aid that has strings unfavorable to Indonesian interests 
tied to it. 
  "Should no foreign aid be available because of this policy, 
we will be ready to carry on our national development by our own 
resources," he said in a speech at the commissioning of the 
Paiton steam driven power plant near this East Java town. 
  The head of state said foreign assistance will remain no 
more 
than a supplement to the country's national resources and in 
future its volume will steadily decrease as these resources 
continue to increase. 
  On the other hand, the president conceded that though the 
nation is resolved to carry on its development on its own 
strength, "we do realize that foreign assistance could be used 
to advantage to further our advancement." 
  A few years back, Indonesia decided to no longer accept 
financial aid from the Netherlands because the donor government 
kept tying its assistance to political strings. 
  The Paiton plant commissioned by the president was 
constructed with domestic funding supplemented by foreign 
financial assistance amounting totally to RP [rupiah] 2.3 
trillion. 
  Two generator units of the plant, completed in the first 
development phase and inaugurated Wednesday, each has a capacity 
of 400 MW [megawatts], with fuel need of two billion tons of 
coal a year. 
  Touching on the coal use, President Suharto said the 36 
billion-ton coal deposit must be benefited to diversify energy 
sources especially because natural oil as the main energy 
source, is not renewable. 
  "Coal will become the main energy source that we can rely on 
in the future," He said at the ceremony which was attended also 
by the first lady, Mrs. Tien Suharto, the World Bank president, 
Lewis Preston, and Minister/State Secretary Murdiono. 
  Acknowledging that it will need hard work, the head of state 
called for a well planned coal use. 
  He also urged for the participation of private sector in 
developing steam power plants (PLTU) in Paiton as well as other 
projects. The state electricity company (PLN) plans in the 
third stage of the Paiton to build a number of more steam power 
plants with a capcity of 1200 x 2 MW respectively, because that 
of the second stage whose capacity is about 800 MW will be built 
by PLN itself. 
  By giving a chance to the private sector to develop 
electricity, telecommunications and social means projects, the 
president said, the government can use its fund for the 
development of Indonesia's eastern and western regions.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Deficit in the 1993/94 Budget"] </F>
  [Text] The state budget experienced a deficit for the first 
time in the history of the New Order. The 1993/94 budget 
indicated a huge deficit of 1.8 trillion rupiah. The huge 
budget deficit will raise questions from numerous sectors, such 
as, will such a deficit reoccur during the 1994/95 fiscal year? 
  In a statement during a plenary session of the House of 
Representatives (DPR) on Monday, 7 March, Finance Minister 
Mar'ie Muhammad stated that more funds will be allocated and 
changes will be made to the 1993/94 budget to keep to a balanced 
budget of 62.65 trillion rupiah. It is clear that such changes 
are needed so income estimates will be at 62.65 trillion rupiah 
while estimates for expenditures will stand at 64.64 trillion 
rupiah. 
  According to the finance minister, the government will 
utilize a balance of payments and proposed reserves for 
development totalling to 1.8 trillion rupiah from previous 
fiscal years in the effort to realize several development 
programs during the 1993/94 fiscal year and as a measure to 
cover the deficit. 
  Our economic planners need to be more watchful if we take 
into account the amount derived from 1993/94 domestic income, 
which stands at only 52.279 trillion rupiah or 0.9 percent lower 
than estimated. This indicates that lower income derived from 
the petroleum sector has not been balanced yet by increased 
nongas exports. 
  Income from the petroleum sector was expected to bring in 
only about 12.507 trillion rupiah or a decline of 17.3 percent 
from the estimated target. The average price of Indonesian oil 
will only stand at U.S.$16.50 per barrel or U.S.$1.50 per barrel 
lower than the projected U.S.$18 per barrel for the 1994/95 
fiscal budget. 
  Therefore, the major cause for the 1993/94 fiscal year 
deficit is due to the lower income derived from the petroleum 
sector. Unquestionably, the lower income derived from the 
petroleum sector was solely due to declining oil prices in the 
international market. 
  Global oil prices continue to slide since last year and in 
February 1994, the price of oil remained static at U.S.$14 per 
barrel. This worrisome condition of our national income from 
the petroleum sector should be expeditiously anticipated. 
  Lately, the price of petroleum in the international market 
further intensifies our concern because current oil prices have 
descended to slightly more than U.S.$13 per barrel. The price 
of Brent Blend [preceding term in English] -- a global demand -- 
stood merely at U.S.$13.05 per barrel on Monday, 7 March. 
  The perpetual decline in oil prices will certainly influence 
our national income for the 1994/95 fiscal year because we 
projected oil prices to stand at U.S.$16 per barrel. National 
income will be lowered by a net 600 billion rupiah if the price 
of oil were to decline by a mere U.S. dollar per barrel. 
  In the effort to avoid another budget deficit as a result of 
the perpetual decline in oil prices, the government has made a 
provision of 3.5 trillion rupiah to be taken out from the 
proposed development reserves. Several sectors will surely ask 
if it was indisputable that another budget deficit can be 
avoided through the utilization of proposed deveopment reserves. 
  The country's economic planners have frequently stated that 
the proposed reserves for development will not be used as long 
as it can be avoided. This means that the proposed reserves for 
development can only be used when there is a problem with 
national income, which in turn, causes a national economic 
crisis. 
  The utilization of proposed development reserves indicates 
an 
"instability' in the national economic situation. As such, an 
alternative source has to be found. Several other alternatives 
exist and the one with the most potential is to effortlessly 
intensify nongas export activities. 
  As a result of the increasing stiff and endless competition 
to gain access to the international market, we must first 
totally eliminate all high-cost economic activities in the 
country in our effort further increase and intensify our nongas 
exports. Indonesian products will never be competitive if such a 
measure is not taken.

  [Text] U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry will visit 
the ROK next month in connection with the North Korean nuclear 
issue. Also, the situation on the Korean peninsula has been 
further strained. Under these circumstances, a North Korean 
authority to the United Nations suddenly showed the position 
today that it would resume negotiations with the United States. 
As a result, changes in the North Korean attitude regarding the 
North Korean nuclear issue newly attract our attention. We have 
news from reporter Yi Chong-ok at the desk international affairs. 
  [Begin Yi recording] A relevant authority of the North 
Korean mission to the United Nations said today that North Korea 
is willing to resume negotiations -- which are suspended at 
present -- with the United States if the ROK-U.S. joint military 
exercise is suspended and if the United States confirms to North 
Korea that it will resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula through dialogue. 
  Japan's KYODO NEWS AGENCY reported: The North Korean 
authority expects negotiations with the United States to be 
resumed. Also, it reported that the authority said that North 
Korea would accept the additional inspections demanded by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency when the U.S.-North Korean 
high-level talks are held. 
  The news agency reported: Such remarks by the North Korean 
authority seem to show that North Korea is intending to avoid 
the strong steps, including economic sanctions, by continuing 
dialogue with the United States. 
  Also, Japan's SISA NEWS AGENCY reported that the United 
States had decided to immediately send U.S. Secretary of Defense 
Perry to the ROK and Japan on 17 April to discuss the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula. [End recording]

  [Text] International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Spokesman 
David Kyd disclosed on 23 March that it seems that North Korea 
will complete the construction of its second nuclear reactor 
within this year. Spokesman Kyd said that North Korea is 
building its second nuclear reactor in Yongbyon. The 50 
megawatt nuclear reactor is scheduled for completion by the end 
of this year. 
  He said that North Korea is currently building a third 
nuclear reactor in Taechon, which is even more secluded than 
Yongbyon, and that the 200-megawatt reactor will begin 
operations early in 1996. 
  He pointed out, however, that the practical issue regarding 
North Korea's plan for nuclear development is how North Korea 
dealt with the nuclear fuel it extracted from the small 
five-megawatt nuclear reactor which has been in operation since 
1987.

  [Text] Beijing, March 24 (YONHAP) -- North Korea can 
mobilize five million troops in 12 hours if war breaks out, a 
Chinese military magazine said. 
  In its March issue, the XIANDAI BINGQI (MODERN ARMS) 
magazine 
said the North Korean People's Army has 115,000 security and 
border troops and some three million Red Guards comprised of 
workers and peasants, in addition to the 1.1 million-strong 
regular Army. 
  The North Korean naval fleet includes 14 Suzhou-class guided 
missile fast boats, each equipped with two SSN2 ship-to-ship 
missile launchers, 16 Shaoxing-class guided missile fast boats, 
each armed with one SSN2 ship-to-ship missile launcher, and six 
Hainan-class patrol boats having one anti-submarine rocket 
launcher apiece, it said, suggesting that the boats are of 
Chinese make. 
  North Korea's Army and air force are also armed with the 
latest ground-to-ground and ground-to-air missiles, the magazine 
reported. "In 1992, North Korea spent 6 billion U.S. dollars, or 
30 percent of its gross national product, for defense buildup." 
  As for the command system of the North Korean People's Army, 
it said the supreme command post is the Central Military 
Commission of the Workers' Party. The Ministry of People's 
Armed Forces is under the control of the Central People's 
Committee and the chief of general staff is controlled directly 
by the People's Armed Forces minister. 
  Under the chief of the general staff are the artillery, 
mechanized forces, navy and air force commanders.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Chun-pom: "Scenario for the </F>
Five-Stage Punishment for North Korea's Provocation"] 
  [Text] In answering a question at the National Assembly 
National Defense Committee on 23 March, ROK Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae said: "The ROK Government has mapped out a strategic 
concept in which if North Korea perpetrates a provocation in the 
five northwestern islands or specific areas [tukchong chiyok], 
the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces or the ROK Armed Forces alone will 
offer powerful punitive retaliation [kangnyokhan ungjingbobok] 
and link this to an opportunity to wage a war to achieve 
reunification [tongiljonyok suhaengui kihoero yongyesikinda] 
depending on the state of the provocation." 
  Minister Yi made these remarks to stress that the ROK and 
the 
United States are all prepared for any emergency and are 
confident that they can meet any provocation of the North and to 
give a powerful warning to North Korea. 
  This is the first declaration that even though the 
government 
adheres to the principle of peaceful reunification, it has a 
plan not only to defend ourselves but to pursue even 
reunification with armed forces [muryoktongilggaji mirobuchil] 
depending on the state of the provocation. 
  This strategic concept stated by Minister Yi is based on a 
strategy of punitive retaliation contained in the "ROK-U.S. 
Combined Operations Plan (OP 5027). That is, this is a 
five-stage strategic concept in which if North Korea launches a 
preemptive attack, the government will not merely deter the 
enemy but conquer Pyongyang, isolate the North Korean regime, 
and enter into the stage of North-South reunification. 
  North Korea has deployed 8,400 long-range cannon and 2,400 
multi-warheaded missiles within 100 km of the DMZ at present. 
  It reportedly has developed or is developing "Taepodong-1 
and 
-2" missiles, in addition to the Nodong-1 and -2 and the Scud 
ground-to- ground missiles. 
  In particular, it has hidden in underground tunnels aircraft 
for transporting commando units to infiltrate into the rear area 
when it launches a southward invasion and has beefed up the 
antiair batteries in Yongbyon, where there are nuclear reactors, 
from five to 47. 
  In preparation against this, the United States has recently 
deployed five of the latest radar tracking devices and put areas 
north of the DMZ under comprehensive 24-hour surveillance and 
even mapped out a plan to attack those batteries in an emergency. 
  The five-stage ROK-U.S. combined operations plan goes like 
this: In the prewar stage (first stage), if the ROK and the 
United States detect dangerous signs from North Korea, they will 
immediately call in the rapid deterrent forces (FDO). 
  At that time, "Defcon (Defense Condition) 3" will be issued, 
and the Armed Forces will assume a combat ready posture [jontu 
chunbi taese]. 
  This is because Seoul is a mere 40 km away from the DMZ and 
we have a mere 24- to 76-hour warning time for a North Korean 
attack. 
  Then, North Korea will bomb frontline units in a 
concentrated 
manner and send commando units to harass the rear of Seoul. As 
a result, major roads will be crowded with refugees, who will 
serve as a decisive obstacle to the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces' 
northward movements. 
  This is a second-stage situation. At that time, North Korea 
will infiltrate ground forces deployed along the DMZ into the 
South and attack Seoul in a concentrated manner by using Scud 
and Nodong-1 and -2 missiles. 
  In response, the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces will attack the 
central area of North Korea, advancing infantry units, and 
fighter planes by using their superior air fire power and 
Mistral, Hawk, and Nike missiles and intercept incoming missiles 
by using Patriot missiles. 
  This means that the defensive strategic concept which had 
been effective up until the mid-seventies and in which the ROK 
would launch a counterattack after abandoning Seoul has been 
replaced by a new concept in which the ROK would "repel North 
Korea north of Seoul." 
  At around this time, the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Carl Vinson 
of the 7th U.S. Fleet will be deployed to the East Sea [Sea of 
Japan] and strike the enemy's rear area in a concentrated manner. 
  At that time, AWACS early-warning planes and antisubmarine 
patrol planes (P-3C) will fly through the skies over the Korean 
peninsula, conduct aerial surveillance not only over North 
Korea, but also over areas of Russia and China, detect 
infiltrating aircraft and submarines in advance, and instruct 
the ground on shooting them down. 
  In the third stage, the armed forces will annihilate the 
major combat forces of North Korea, break through the DMZ, 
conduct large-scale landing operations, and advance northward. 
  At that time, the ROK and the United States will expand the 
frontline toward the Chongchon River, north of Pyongyang. 
  However, in this strategic concept, the ROK and the United 
States left the issue of whether they will advance toward the 
Yalu River at this stage for further deliberations depending on 
the situation. 
  No decision has been made on whether the 400,000 U.S. troops 
which will be reinforced with troops from the U.S. mainland will 
participate in the northward advance. The next stage is one of 
isolation. The forces will completely isolate Pyongyang from 
the rest of North Korea and establish a military rule, which 
includes civilian controls [chumintongjedung kunsatongchirul 
silsihanda]. 
  The final, fifth stage will be a postwar phase. At this 
stage, the ROK will take the initiative to achieve reunification 
on the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 (YONHAP) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam's state visit to Japan on Thursday will spur 
bilateral military cooperation, with Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae traveling to Tokyo late next month and South Korea's 
Navy calling at a Japanese port within the year, the SANKEI 
SHIMBUN reported in a Seoul-datelined story on Thursday. 
  Quoting military sources in Seoul, the Japanese newspaper 
said the two countries would shortly agree to exchange flight 
information to prevent accidents involving military planes as 
the first step of cooperation. 
  South Korea is interested in defense exchanges and 
cooperation with Japan because its plans to promote military 
links with China and Russia have not met expectations since the 
establishment of diplomatic ties under former President No 
Tae-u, it observed. 
  Influenced by President Kim's Japan policy calling for 
future-oriented relations, the South Korean military has begun 
showing a keen interest in that country, it added. 
  Defense Minister Yi was to accompany President Kim to Japan 
in late March but has decided to go late next month for in-depth 
talks with Japanese defense leaders on military cooperation, the 
report said. 
  It is highly likely that a South Korean naval fleet will 
call 
at a Japanese port this year, entailing a return call by the 
Japanese at a South Korean port, it quoted a Seoul military 
source as saying. 
  At present, the two countries conduct two military personnel 
exchange programs a year covering mutual visits by army, navy, 
air force and joint chiefs of staff personnel.

<F P=106> [Address by President Kim Yong-sam prior to departing for </F>
official visits to Japan and China at Seoul Airport -- live] 
  [Text] Dear fellow countrymen: It is raining now to bless 
our future. I am making official visits to Japan and China for 
a week beginning today in my capacity as a state guest for the 
first time since I took office as president. At a news 
conference with reporters earlier this year, I said that I would 
not hesitate in going anywhere in the world to be a salesperson 
for our national interests. My visits to Japan and China this 
time are to put such will into practice. For the past year 
since I took on the presidency, I have met over 20 heads of 
state, and found them all to share one common factor--that they 
all were pursuing their respective national interests. 
  Our closest neighbors historically and geographically, Japan 
and China, are our partners in leading the Asia-Pacific era. I 
will reconfirm this on this visit. At the same time, I will 
relay the impressive efforts during the past year of our fellow 
countrymen for reforms and for building a new state, to the 
people of these two countries. 
  The globalization trend is increasing in the international 
community daily. Distances between countries are shrinking, and 
relations of mutual reliance are deepening. In particular, a 
new world trade order of indefinite competition has emerged in 
the wake of the Uruguay Round. In order for the ROK, China, and 
Japan to mutually enjoy political stability and economic 
prosperity in such an era of rapid change, it is very important 
for close cooperation to take place. 
  Japan and China are our second and third largest trade 
partners. Most of our foreign investment has been in China. 
Amid such a trend in the world economy, cooperation is ever 
increasing among the three countries, all with different 
industrial structures and developing rates. Mutually 
complementary cooperation and partnership will enable all three 
countries to strengthen each's competitiveness. 
  Fellow countrymen: 
  During my visit, I will hold deep consultations with Japan 
and China on how the three countries can cooperate for Asia's 
security and peace. In particular, the North Korean nuclear 
issue is not only a grave issue for us, but is also closely 
related to the security of Northeast Asia and world peace. 
North Korea has refused to sincerely receive the inspections by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency and has even unilaterally 
broken off the North-South dialogue, thus creating a crisis on 
the Korean peninsula. It even threatens our people with severe 
words that state that it is ready for war. 
  We will resolutely defeat any kind of provocation by North 
Korea with the firm security cooperative system of the ROK and 
the United States. During the security-related ministers' 
meeting on 21 March which I chaired, I reconfirmed our flawless 
security posture and consolidated a firm will to deal with 
whatever situation we may come to face. U.S. President Clinton 
sent me a personal letter promising that the United States will 
sincerely abide by its security pledge toward the ROK, whatever 
the situation. We will by no means yield to North Korea's 
threats. We will keep the doors open so that dialogue can begin 
as soon as they change their attitude. 
  I will ask for Japan and China's cooperation during my visit 
to the two countries to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue 
and call for North Korea's reform and openness, as it is now 
isolated internationally. The three countries of the ROK, 
China, and Japan each has its share of work in resolving the 
North Korean nuclear issue. 
  I intend to explain to the leaders of the two countries that 
true reconciliation and peace are not only crucial to the 
prosperity of East Asia but also to the Asian-Pacific region, 
and ask for their cooperation. 
  Fellow countrymen: During my visit to Japan, I am scheduled 
to meet Emperor Akihito and hold two summits with Prime Minister 
Hosokawa. I will also make a speech before the Diet and reveal 
how I envision ROK-Japanese relations in the 21st century. In 
addition, I will meet the leaders of Japan's political and 
economic circles to exchange views on worthwhile mutual 
exchanges. At Waseda University, I will talk about the future 
role of youth in the ROK and Japan. 
  As for the summit with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, since 
I 
held exclusive talks with him in Seattle last year, this will be 
our second summit meeting. In the upcoming summit, we will 
contemplate our relations which have been maintained for a long 
time. I am also scheduled to meet Premier Li Peng. 
  I will observe economic developments in Shanghai and Tianjin 
and will visit the site of our former provisional government in 
Shanghai. 
  I also intend to convey the warm greetings of our people to 
fellow countrymen living in Japan and China. 
  Fellow countrymen: 
  The ROK is no longer on the periphery of the earth. Having 
opened an era of civilian government and being third in economic 
rank in the world [segye chesamwiui kyongjeryog], the ROK is 
emerging as a core country in the 21st century. The ROK is 
actively participating in and contributing to setting up a new 
order in the Pacific era. This is not just our opinion but how 
the world sees us. 
  Let us all have pride and a sense of mission! Let us all 
realize our ambition with reforms and internationalization! Let 
us all turn this country into a country that contributes to 
creating a new civilization. 
  Even though I briefly depart, fellow countrymen, I will 
remain with you always. 
  Fellow countrymen, I will return soon.

  [Text] Seoul, March 24 KYODO -- South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam left Seoul on Thursday [24 February] for a weeklong 
trip to Japan and China to seek support for last-ditch efforts 
to defuse the crisis over North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons 
program. 
  Kim's trip, his first state visit to the two countries since 
taking office in February 1993, was originally designed to 
strengthen South Korea's economic ties with its nearest 
neighbors. 
  Kim told reporters Tuesday he hopes his visit will serve as 
a 
turning point in resolving the nuclear crisis on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  He said besides in-depth discussion of the North Korean 
problem, bilateral economic cooperation and closer trade ties 
will top his agenda in talks with Japanese and Chinese leaders. 
  Kim is scheduled to hold talks with Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa on Thursday and Friday, and with Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin next Monday. He will return to Seoul on 
Wednesday. 
  Kim is being accompanied by his wife Son Myong-sun and three 
cabinet ministers. 
  In a departure ceremony at Seoul airport, Kim said he will 
try to obtain support from Japan and China to resolve the 
nuclear issue and also bring North Korea around to reform and 
openness. 
  "I will explain to the two leaders of Japan and China that 
preserving reconciliation and peace on the Korean peninsula is 
important to ensuring stability and prosperity in the 
Asia-Pacific region as well as in Northeast Asia," Kim said. 
  He said North Korea has created confrontation on the Korean 
peninsula by failing to allow unhindered inspections of its 
nuclear facilities and make progress in inter-Korean dialogue. 
  "While keeping the channel of dialogue open, South Korea, 
with firm security commitment of the United States, is also 
fully determined to fight against any possible provocation by 
North Korea," he said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 24 (YONHAP) -- The government has 
decided to strengthen public security and its anti-crime posture 
in preparation for any emergencies that might arise while 
President Kim Yong-sam is visiting Japan and China. 
  The government held a public security-related ministers' 
meeting on Thursday and decided to tighten overall security so 
that the president can conclude his tour successfully without 
worrying about the domestic situation. 
  Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang presided over the meeting, 
attended by nine ministers including Home Minister Choe Hyong-u, 
Justice Minister Kim Tu-hui and Communications Minister Yun 
Tong-yun. 
  The government will be on guard against possible terrorist 
attacks on public office buildings and foreign missions while 
taking steps to beef up national security. 
  It will also strive to prevent large-scale calamities 
including forest fires and traffic accidents. 
  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yi will preside over a 
security-related ministers' meeting on Friday to check movements 
by the North Korean forces and discuss ways to ensure security 
during President Kim's absence.

  [Text] Seoul, March 24 (YONHAP) -- Exports of Korean beef 
and its products to the United States have been made possible 
beginning April 1, a Foreign Ministry official said on Thursday. 
  He said that at a Korea-U.S. trade meeting held at the 
Foreign Ministry on Wednesday, the United States agreed to 
exclude Korea from a cattle epidemic area, paving the way for 
the exports of Korean beef to the United States. 
  Also at Wednesday's meeting, the United States protested 
over 
Korea's recent discarding of a large amount of American sausages 
for the expiration of their marketing period. 
  According to the official, a U.S. delegate said it was 
unreasonable for Korea to sharply shorten sausages' tolerable 
marketing period from 90 days to 30 days and discard imported 
American sausages based thereon. 
  The United States further asked Korea to allow the imports 
of 
the heads of codfish. But, Korea said it cannot at least until 
due steps are taken to ensure the sanitary handling of codfish 
heads which are used in the United States only as a livestock 
feed material, the official said.

  [Text] Won Chol-hui was elected chairman of the National 
Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF) for a four-year term 
yesterday. 
  Won, 56, took over the chairmanship of the NACF by earning 
875 of the 1,386 votes cast directly by regional cooperatives 
heads at the NACF auditorium. 
  Won, an executive vice president of the NACF, competed with 
two other candidates, Chong Ki-su and Chong Tae-kun, who 
garnered 162 and 345 votes, respectively. 
  The new NACF head assumes the chairmanship today as the 
second NACF to be selected chosen directly by federation 
deputies. 
  Won succeeds Han Ho-son, who is now under arrest on charges 
of embezzlement. Han resigned from the post last Saturday. 
  "I will push ahead with drastic reforms to transform the 
NACF 
into a "genuine" body which will serve farmers and will develop 
new projects," the new chairman said in a news conference 
shortly after the election.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Australia Is Overdoing It"] </F>
  [Text] Australia has said publicly on many occasions that 
its survival and future interests depend on Asia, particularly 
Southeast Asia, whose 350 million population possesses 
considerable buying power. With this in mind, Australia has 
strengthened economic relations with the region, particularly 
with ASEAN, to firm up its foundation for future interests. 
However, if Australia regards all Thais who step on its soil as 
criminals, it is creating danger for itself. 
  Australian immigration officials can hardly deny that they 
are treating every Thai man and woman arriving at Australian air 
and sea ports in a discriminatory manner. Their luggage is 
thoroughly inspected and women are given body searches as if 
they are wanted criminals. All of this is simply because they 
carry Thai passports. This is untolerable. 
  If things worsen to the point that Thai people express their 
dissatisfaction with Australia at the national level, 
Thai-Australian relations will be harmed more than by any 
expression by the Thai Government. Thai people have wondered 
for some time what criteria Australian officials use to reach 
the assumption that all Thais are heroin traffickers and Thai 
women are prostitutes. Holders of other passports do not seem to 
be subjected to this assumption. 
  We want to warn Australia that things will worsen if it does 
not rectify this matter. The discrimination against Thais is 
unacceptable. It is a fact that Thais hardly create any 
problems for Australia, compared with refugees coming to that 
country. Thais certainly create less problems than the large 
number of Hong Kong nationals, who merely go there to establish 
permanent residency but never really live there. In addition, 
the Thai Government has never treated Australia in an aggressive 
manner as it has some countries. Does Australia want to be 
treated that way by the Thai people? 
  If ASEAN should get tough, Australian aircraft and 
commercial 
ships will face great difficulties and Australian interests in 
Southeast Asia will shrink. Australia must not forget how 
countries having ambassadorial-level relations should treat each 
other. The treatment of Thais as if they are criminal suspects 
should be regarded as an insult to Thai people. 
  We ask Australia to remedy the way it treats Thai people. We 
want to know how Australia will feel if all holders of 
Australian passports are given completely thorough luggage 
checks and Australian women are given body searches as they 
arrive at Thai airports, sea ports, or border train stations.

  [Text] THAILAND should consider establishing an embassy 
in Israel, as the situation in the Middle East has improved, a 
senior Foreign Ministry official said yesterday. 
  "It is time for Thailand to have an embassy there as the 
peace process is underway. It would be a lot easier to think 
about it now than in two or three years," the official said. 
  He said Israel had developed technologies in various fields 
including medicine and agriculture, which Thailand could make 
use of. 
  Thailand's embassy in Rome presently oversees Israel, while 
Israel has had an embassy in Bangkok since 1957. 
  The official also said the Palestine Liberation 
Organization's (PLO) official presence in Thailand would 
initially be in the form of a representative's office. 
  "The PLO at this time cannot have an embassy as it does not 
have statehood yet," the official said. A final decision on the 
matter rests with the minister. 
  In this way Thailand will "show its political support for 
the 
Middle East peace process now underway," he said. 
  The establishment of the PLO's representative office was 
decided on three years ago but was put on hold because of the 
Gulf War. 
  In addition to an embassy in Israel's Tel Aviv, the Foreign 
Ministry is also considering setting up consulates in China's 
Shanghai, Cambodia's Battambang, and Laos' Savannakhet. 
  Thailand last year approved the establishment of a Laotian 
consulate in the Northeast. While Laos is considering setting 
it up in Udon Thani, Khon Kaen or Nong Khai, the Thai Foreign 
Ministry has expressed its preference for Nong Khai.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Chuan Ditches the Ones Who Shed Blood for </F>
Democracy"] 
  [Text] Last year, the administration of Prime Minister 
Chuan Likphai promised to create a park and build a monument to 
commemorate the May 1992 bloody political events and a similar 
uprising in August 1973 when scores of people disappeared or 
were killed. 
  Till today, however, this promise still remains to be 
fulfilled. 
  On Tuesday, the May 1992 Heroes' Relatives Committee 
appealed 
to the government to speed up the building of the monument to 
remember the deaths of those who took part in the bloody 
prodemocracy rallies on Ratchadamnoen Avenue and to wrap up 
investigations into the disappearance of some 41 people during 
the May crisis. 
  The anxiety of the families and friends of those who went 
missing in May 1992 is understandable. Many of the 
pro-democracy demonstrators who disappeared were breadwinners 
for their families and their next-of-kin have not been given any 
financial assistance whatsoever by the government. Though the 
Interior Ministry announced that it had already provided a total 
of Bt26 million to 1,359 families of victims of the bloodshed 
and would continue to provide assistance until May 1995, it 
should be borne in mind that this aid does not extend to the 
next-of-kin of the missing. 
  The problem of those missing after the May massacre has to 
be 
accepted as a national trauma, even though some quarters in Thai 
society might suggest that they are best forgotten. 
  The May 1992 Heroes' Relatives Committee accused the Chuan 
government of having failed to do enough to ensure justice for 
the relatives and they felt let down by the administration. 
  "The government has been negligent on issues concerning the 
May victims. This shows the coalition is insincere in getting 
to the bottom of the problem and doesn't support democracy in a 
meaningful way," said the committee's leader Adun Kheowboriphun 
who lost his only son in May 1991, when he was cut down by a 
hail of bullets on Ratchadamnoen Avenue. 
  The question remains: What is the underlying fear that 
prevents the Chuan government from letting the public know the 
findings of a commission set up by the Anan II administration to 
look into the May 1991 events? 
  The point to be made is that if the public knew the truth 
about what really happened, some of the wilder rumours about how 
the bodies of the missing were disposed would be dispelled. 
Until this is accepted, there will be further argument between 
opposing sides and the conflict will never be resolved. 
  Nearly two years later, we can't help but ask: Was it worth 
going out onto the streets, facing police batons and Army 
bullets on Ratchadamnoen Avenue, risking our lives and demanding 
democracy -- only to get a lameduck government that disregards 
everyone's interests but its own? 
  Democracy in Thailand survives on promises for a better 
future and a fear of a return to the brutal past. But now it 
seems the promises made by Chuan cannot be fulfilled. 
  A major message of May 1992 is that an eligible candidate 
for 
the prime ministership must be an elected MP. The post of the 
country's chief executive can no longer be monopolized by army 
generals and political appointees. Also, politicians must be 
more cautious about their conduct because they can come under 
intense scrutiny as a result of heightened public expectations. 
  But many politicians seem to have forgotten the profound 
changes that have taken place around them and remain 
pre-occupied with their own narrow self-interests. Political 
bickering has become their way of life, to the extent that they 
have lost sight of their official duty -- to make decisions on 
how to deal effectively with problems facing the country. 
  Politics in Thailand has become a game of 
self-aggrandizement 
played by society's well-to-do. Little thought is given to the 
people, let alone the pro-democracy protesters who helped place 
MPs in their positions of authority and responsibility. The 
proposed constitutional amendments are a good example of how 
little these politicians care for the people. While the 
amendments are of utmost importance to guarantee the rights of 
the people, MPs are arguing over the number of points to be 
passed at the extraordinary session of Parliament next week. 
  Instead of displaying his leadership to rein in government 
and opposition MPs over this issue, and to help solve many other 
problems plaguing the country, Chuan has been behaving like Nero 
fiddling away while Rome burns. 
  Day by day, the prime minister seems to be losing support. 
The May relatives have now joined the academics and 
pro-democracy movement in not wanting to have anything to do 
with him. The message is clear: Whatever government purports to 
represent us must also champion our rights. Chuan Likphai has 
failed the very people whose loved ones gave their lives for his 
government. 
  The writing on the wall is clear. Since Chuan has, after two 
years, failed to shape up, he must now ship out.

  [Text] Even though the truck bomb belonging to 
international terrorists that was discovered recently did not 
cause a devastating explosion, we should not let the incident 
pass as if nothing happened. At the least, the terrorists 
committed a crime by killing a Thai and putting his body in a 
water tank that contained explosives. Imagine how serious the 
damage would have been if the highly destructive bomb had really 
exploded. The damage would not only have affected the target of 
the terrorists' revenge, but also Thai people who were not the 
target of their vengeance at all. 
  Therefore, we must not let this savage act pass like a 
trivial issue. At least their colleagues in the movement will 
realize that committing terrorist acts, killing our people, and 
causing damage in our country are unacceptable to us. They will 
never gain the Thai people's sympathy or support for their 
fight. Therefore, this terrorist act in our country has ruined 
any chance for friendship and understanding from the Thai 
people. They must keep this fact in mind. 
  Whatever the target of the terrorist act was -- whether it 
involved the Palestinian-Israeli problem, the Arab-Israeli 
conflict, or any religious or political dispute -- if they 
cannot love each other the way human beings should help and 
sympathize with one another, and if they remain vengeful rather 
than reaching an understanding with each other, let them carry 
out their revenge somewhere else. They must not use Thai 
territory as a battlefield for their vengeance and destruction. 
  Thailand is friendly with all countries. Our country is open 
to people of all nations in compliance with our policy of 
promoting tourism, which is a way to bring money into the 
country and encourage the country's economic growth. We do not 
want this open door policy to make our country a battlefield for 
people from one country to take out revenge and kill people from 
other countries, or for a follower of one ideology to harm 
someone who holds different beliefs. We do not want our country 
to be a venue for revenge. 
  We hope they understand the Thai people's desires. They must 
know that committing crimes in other countries will cause them 
to be hated. At the same time, it will also isolate them from 
the world community. An isolated struggle, without sympathy 
from the world community, will never bring victory -- only 
defeat. Those who commit terrorist acts in other countries will 
be denied entry. Thailand is ready to deny entry and not welcome 
these kinds of people.

<F P=106> ["Interview with VCP General Secretary Do Muoi to BERNAMA </F>
correspondent" -- VNA headline] 
  [Text] [No dateline as received] [Correspondent] Your 
Excellency, obviously your impending visit to Malaysia will be 
more than just a state visit. In your assessment in what aspect 
Vietnam's relations with Malaysia can be further improved: Are 
you satisfied with the current state of relations between the 
two countries? What are the obstacles to enhancing the 
relationship, if any? In conjunction with your visit can we 
expect Vietnam and Malaysia to sign new agreements for new areas 
of mutual cooperation to enhance the already excellent ties 
between the two countries? 
  [Do Muoi] In the past time, the relations of friendship and 
multifaceted cooperation between our two countries have seen 
fine developments. I'm satisfied with the harmonious 
developments in economic as well as political relations between 
our two countries. The two countries have exchanged many 
high-level delegations and signed many cooperative agreements, 
creating favourable political and legal basis for the 
development and expansion of cooperation on various fields in 
accordance with the potential of each country. 
  At the invitation of H.E. [His Excellency] Dr Mohamad 
Mahathir, prime minister of Malaysia, I'Il conduct an official 
and friendship visit to Malaysia. The main objectives of this 
visit are to study Malaysian precious experiences in 
socio-economic development, to consolidate and further 
strengthen mutual understanding and trust, thereby contributing 
to the more effective development of the cooperative 
relationship between our two countries. This will create 
favourable conditions for concerned agencies of the two 
countries to strengthen and expand the existing cooperation in 
various fields, meeting the aspiration and interests of the 
peoples of our two countries. My visit this time doesn't aim at 
signing concrete cooperative agreement, which is under the 
competence of the two states. 
  [Correspondent] Your Excellency, you were once quoted in a 
newspaper article that you encourage party and government 
officials to travel abroad and bring home experience to turn 
Vietnam into a strong country with rich people. 
  In this context, do you think Malaysia can also play a role 
towards helping Vietnam achieve that objective? 
  Can we also reverse the scenario. In what way can Vietnam 
help Malaysia share Vietnam's expertise in certain fields? 
  [Do Muoi] Vietnam attaches importance to the research and 
proper application of good experiences of the world under our 
own circumstances in order to build a Vietnam of `rich people, 
strong nation, just and civilized society'. The achievements in 
the renewal process of Vietnam over the past years recognized by 
the world community have also proved that we have combined 
harmoniously the national self-reliance and the trend of 
cooperation for development in the present era. 
  Vietnam and Malaysia are geographically close and share many 
similarities in culture as well as traditional practice and 
customs. Malaysia has carried out excellently its strategy of 
socio-economic development and has drawn many precious 
experiences, which are highly appreciated internationally. At 
present, Malaysia ranks second among ASEAN investors in Vietnam. 
I am fully confident that, provided with these factors, 
Malaysia will play a deserving role in helping Vietnam build and 
develop the country in accordance with the good relationship 
between the two countries. On our part, we're ready to exchange 
views with Malaysia on questions of Malaysian concern in the 
spirit of friendship, trust and cooperation for the prosperity 
of our respective country and for the common wealth of Southeast 
Asia. 
  [Correspondent] Finally, Your Excellency, what is your 
vision 
of Southeast Asia and Asia as a whole in the near future? 
  [Do Muoi] Peace and development which are the age-old 
aspiration of nations are now becoming more and more imperative 
need of all countries in the world. Southeast Asia has never 
enjoyed favourable conditions as it does at present for the 
cooperation among countries in the spirit of understanding and 
friendship in an effort to achieve their common goal of 
maintaining peace stability and creating an international 
environment favourable for the development of their individual 
countries and the region as a whole. Prompted by this spirit, 
Vietnam has signed the Bali Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, 
become an ASEAN observer and is now participating in a number of 
ASEAN commissions and projects, preparing for its admission to 
ASEAN when conditions are ripe. Vietnam will also participate 
in the ASEAN Regional Forum on Security held in Bangkok. We 
support the Malaysian initiative for the East Asia Economic 
Forum. 
  A prosperous Southeast Asia is not only an indispensable 
condition for the construction of each country but also a very 
important factor for peace, stability in Asia-Pacific as a 
whole, a centre which is drawing much attention from the world 
community for its dynamics and great prospects in the 21st 
century. 
  For Vietnam, strengthening its cooperation with other 
countries in Southeast Asia and Asia-Pacific is of special 
importance. Our foreign policy enjoys warm sympathy and 
response from Malaysia and other countries. We are striving for 
a consistent objective, that is to maintain durable peace for 
national development cooperation, making considerable 
contribution to prosperity of the region and of the world as a 
whole.

<F P=106> [NHAN DAN 24 March editorial: "Great Potential in </F>
Vietnam-Malaysia Relations"] 
  [Text] Ties between Vietnam and Malaysia and other 
nations in the region have developed positively in the past. 
Vietnam has joined the Bali Treaty, become observer to ASEAN, 
and participated in various ASEAN activities. 
  Following General Secretary Do Muoi's official visit to 
Singapore and Thailand in October 1993, his official visit to 
Malaysia this time will, once again, assert Vietnam's open-door 
foreign policy of independence, sovereignty, and diversified 
diplomatic activities, which has been welcomed by the region and 
the world. It will also help strengthen our foreign policy 
towards Southeast Asia and ASEAN member countries, thereby 
contributing to enhancing stability, security, and development 
in the region. 
  We are pleased to see the great achievements scored by the 
Malaysian people in their efforts to build a prosperous and 
happy country. In implementing the new economic policy in the 
past two decades or more, the Malaysian people through their 
efforts, creativity, and hard work, have brought their country 
from a renowned rubber and tin producing nation to an 
industrial-manufacturing nation with modern electronic 
facilities. Its engineering production sector has contributed 
greatly to the GNP. In the first three years of the 90's, this 
sector's output accounted for 29 percent of the GNP, compared to 
23 percent in the 70's. In 1993, Malaysia attained an economic 
growth of eight percent, thus balancing the national budget for 
the first time. It also achieved a balance of payments surplus 
of $200 million in 1993 compared to a $2.2-billion deficit in 
1992. Its per capita income now is $2,965 [figure as heard] and 
it is estimated that Malaysia's GNP will increase to 8.5-9 
percent in 1994. Therefore, the goal of turning Malaysia into a 
developed and industrialized country by the year 2020 is likely 
to materialize. 
  Vietnam and Malaysia are two close neighbors. We have 
similarities in our history and culture. The two countries 
have, for a long time established relations of friendship, 
mutual trust, and understanding. In recent years, the 
multifaceted cooperation between the two countries have 
developed rapidly and favorably. In 1993, Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet paid an official friendship visit to Malaysia, while 
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed returned the visit 
with a trip to Vietnam, thus helping to strengthen cooperation. 
The two sides are effectively implementing bilateral agreements 
on promoting and ensuring investments, and on shipping, 
economic, scientific-technological, postal, and environmental 
protection cooperation as well as on payments between the state 
banks of the two nations. 
  The Malaysian Government has also decided to provide Vietnam 
with $700,000 worth of aid to help us build and develop our 
infrastructure. It has agreed to provide training to Vietnamese 
public health and economic workers. Two-way trade value 
increased from $20 million in 1985 to $100 million in 1990, 
while a substantial increase was attained in 1993. 
  To date, Malaysia has 24 investment projects in Vietnam with 
a total capital of more than $200 million. It is the second 
highest investor among ASEAN countries and 10th among countries 
investing in Vietnam. Bilateral cooperation in culture, the 
arts, and tourism has also been promoted. 
  Worthy of note is that the Malaysian leaders and people have 
expressed their willingness to share with Vietnam their 
experiences in national construction and development. Prime 
Minister Mahathir Mohamed has said: We are ready to enhance 
friendship and cooperation with Vietnam because we are confident 
that Vietnam is honestly wishing to live in peace and 
cooperation with neighboring countries in the Southeast Asian 
community. 
  General Secretary Do Muoi has recently asserted that the 
Vietnamese party, state, and people's wishes to consistently 
strengthen the relations of friendship, solidarity, and 
multifaceted cooperation with Malaysia. 
  We wish General Secretary Do Muoi's official friendship 
visit 
to Malaysia, a beautiful and congenial country, a splendid 
success, thereby opening up the great potential in 
Vietnam-Malaysia ties, while contributing to strengthening 
peace, friendship, cooperation, and prosperity for Southeast 
Asia and the Asia-Pacific.

  [Text] Vietnam has done its best to further consolidate and 
develop solidarity and multifaceted cooperation with Cuba. This 
was stated by party Secretary General Do Muoi at the reception 
given in honor of visiting Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
Gonzalez in Hanoi. The Cuban foreign minister was received by 
Vietnamese leaders, who all reaffirmed the Vietnam's unchanged 
support for Cuban people and government in their efforts to 
overcome present difficulties and their successful carrying out 
of the national construction and defense. 
  Vietnam and Cuba have an age-old traditional relationship. 
Vietnamese people appreciate the Cuban party, government, and 
people for their long solidarity, strong support, and general 
assistance to the Vietnamese people's revolution. The visit to 
Cuba by the Vietnamese party and government delegation led by 
Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet in July last year was a new step in 
bilateral relations between Vietnam and Cuba. 
  Speaking with the newspaper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN, or Army 
paper, 
Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said: The Vietnamese people will 
never forget the support and assistance reserved for Vietnam by 
the Cuban people during the years of the anti-U.S war for 
national salvation. With the spirit for Vietnam, Cuba was 
prepared to donate even their own blood. Vietnamese people deem 
it their obligation and responsibility to share with Cuban 
people all wealth and woes, especially in the current difficult 
time for Cuba. 
  During the Cuba visit last year, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
reached an agreement where Vietnam is providing Cuba with 10 
million tons [figure as heard] of rice annually. Vietnam also 
offers to share experiences with Cuban people on its renovation 
process. At present, Vietnam and Cuba have strengthened 
comprehensive cooperation, especially in education, health, 
transport and communication, and agriculture. 
  The visit to Vietnam by Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Gonzalez will help further consolidate the fraternity and mutual 
cooperation between Vietnam and Cuba. Before leaving Hanoi on 
23 March, the Cuban foreign minister told a press conference: 
  [Begin Robaina recording in Spanish fading into English 
translation] My visit to Vietnam this time is very special and 
comes with satisfactory results. This time I could see with my 
own eyes the achievements of the Vietnamese people in their doi 
moi -- renovation. These are very precious experiences for the 
Cuban people. I believe that the ties between Vietnam and Cuba 
will be further consolidated and developed in the future. [end

  [Text] Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and Deputy Prime 
Minister Nguyen Khanh held a meeting yesterday morning with the 
secretary of the party committee and chairman of the people's 
committee of Ha Giang Province, together with representatives of 
government ministries and sectors at the central level. The 
meeting reviewed results of the one-year pilot project in which 
Ha Giang was picked by the government as a socioeconomic 
development model for the mountain region. 
  After listening to the reports of Ha Giang leaders on the 
implementation of socioeconomic programs in the past year, Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet and Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Khanh, and 
representatives of government ministries and sectors discussed 
socioeconomic programs for Ha Giang in 1994. They suggested 
concrete measures for these programs stressing the need to 
deploy local resources in the effective use of central 
government-subsidized capital. On a per capita basis, this 
province receives among the highest subsidy for provinces. 
  The delegates also discussed the responsibility of 
government 
ministries and sectors in helping the locality achieve its 
socioeconomic targets in accordance with government directives. 
Prime Minister stressed that last year's achievements attested 
to the great efforts of the party organization and the 
multi-ethnic people to overcome all the difficulties a newly 
formed province faces in using government assistance 
effectively, and in coordinating with central ministries and 
sectors. 
  From the Ha Giang experiment, other mountain provinces can 
learn leadership and management at every level, the division of 
responsibilities, and coordination between localities and 
ministries and sectors at the central level. 
  On orientations for future economic activities, the prime 
minister suggested that Ha Giang Province move from a 
self-sufficient and self-reliant economy, and develop 
manufacturing in 1994 as a solid base for further progress. The 
province should establish areas that specialize in high-value 
and high-yield plants, trees, or livestock. It should also set 
a dateline to complete the settled-home and settled-farming 
campaign for some 500 households, which are still living and 
practising nomadic lives and farming, and for over 2,300 
households who have now settled down, but are still practicing 
nomadic farming. Slash-and-burn farming should be prevented, 
reforestation on empty land and bare hills and mountains should 
be sped up, and about 2,000 hectares of poor forest need to be 
replanted. Small and medium-scale industries should be 
developed, especially manufacturing and processing. The prime 
minister also reminded the province to develop small 
hydroelectricity projects to exploit local energy sources for 
industry and daily use. 
  On social and cultural aspects, the prime minister has urged 
Ha Giang to quickly develop the people-initiated education 
model, especially in the building of schools. This is so that 
in the next two or three years, all local schools would be 
properly built structures with tile-roofing and would be able to 
take in 60 percent of the children of school-going age who are 
not in school at present. In each particular ethnic group, 
there should be an appropriate model to promote hygienic living 
and eating habits, and family planning. Party cadres and 
members and youth federation members should be models. These 
criteria should be used in cadre and party member assessment. 
The province should also also strive to solve the water 
shortage affecting nearly 100,000 people, especially for those 
living in mountainous areas. 
  Cultural activities should be brought to the grassroots 
level. The indigenous, cultural characteristics should be 
maintained, while obsolete and superstitious practices that 
cause losses and wastage should be done away with. 
  On direction and management, the prime minister has 
requested 
the relevant ministries and sectors at central level to work out 
separate programs for Ha Giang Province in their respective 
areas. They should form a specialized team for each specific 
area and learn from their experiences. 
  Various agencies in Ha Giang should work closely with cadres 
at district and village levels. Each cadre of the party 
committee should be assigned to be responsible for one hamlet or 
tribal village. The most capable cadres should be assigned to 
be responsible for the most difficult tasks. There should 
training be and advanced programs for ethnic cadres selected 
from mass movements, especially in remote and inaccessible areas.

  [Text] New York, March 23 KYODO -- North Korea is ready to 
reopen talks with the United States over its alleged nuclear 
weapons program provided Washington makes some concessions, a 
North Korean official said here Wednesday. 
  In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, the official with 
North Korea's mission to the United Nations said Washington must 
cancel plans to hold joint military exercises with South Korea 
and demonstrate that it seeks to solve the nuclear controversy 
in negotiations. 
  The U.S. and South Korea earlier this week agreed in 
principle to resume the large-scale maneuvers known as "Team 
Spirit." 
  The move came after the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) reported that its inspectors had not been allowed to 
carry out certain measures at North Korea's nuclear facilities 
and the IAEA referred the matter to the UN Security Council. 
  The official also said Pyongyang would allow the IAEA to 
hold 
follow-up inspections to make sure that North Korea has not 
diverted any nuclear material for military purposes, provided 
high-level U.S.-North Korea talks take place. 
  In an earlier deal, Washington had agreed to such talks on 
condition that North Korea allow full nuclear inspections and 
exchange special envoys with South Korea. 
  Washington called off the talks that were to have started in 
Geneva on Monday and Pyongyang then said it would not attend. 
  The official declined to reveal whether Washington and 
Pyongyang had made any unofficial contacts since the IAEA on 
Monday referred the North Korean issue to the UN Security 
Council. 
  Pointing to "40 years of friendly relations" with China 
"dating back to the hard times of the Korean War," the official 
expressed confidence that Beijing would not support any move to 
force North Korea to comply with the inspection demands. 
  The five permanent members of the Security Council on 
Wednesday conferred privately on a resolution urging North Korea 
to accept unrestricted inspections, but the Chinese envoy on 
Tuesday declined to discuss the text on grounds that such a 
measure is premature. 
  Wednesday was the third day in a row that Britain, China, 
France, Russia and the United States met over the issue. 
  China could use its veto power to block any council action 
aimed at bringing North Korea into line. 
  Asked after the talks if China would abstain or vote against 
the U.S.-proposed resolution, China's envoy Li Zhaoxing said 
that he does not intend to comment on the matter "at the present 
stage." 
  British Ambassador David Hannay, however, voiced 
expectations 
that China will abstain, pointing to China's constructive 
attitude in preparing the resolution. "China is not blocking 
the drafting procedures," Hannay said. 
  China abstained together with Pakistan when the Security 
Council adopted a resolution last may urging North Korea to 
reconsider its suspended decision to withdraw from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam began a three-day state visit to Japan on Thursday [24 
March] receiving red-carpet treatment and cheering students at a 
welcome ceremony. Kim and the South Korean first lady, who wore 
a pastel-yellow chima chogori traditional Korean dress, shook 
hands and exchanged courtesies with the Emperor Akihito and 
Empress Michiko in the hall of the Akasaka Palace. 
  Students waiting in front of the Akasaka Palace waved small 
South Korean and Japanese flags when Kim and his wife Son 
Myong-sun emerged together with the imperial couple. Kim, who 
was given a full-fledged military welcome attended by most 
cabinet members and heads of both houses of the Diet, looked 
tense during the ceremony despite an occasional smile. 
  After being saluted by honor guards and listening to the 
South Korean and Japanese anthems, Kim and his wife were greeted 
by Crown Prince Naruhito, Crown Princess Masako, Princess Nori 
and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Following Kim's pacing off the honor guards under a partly 
cloudy sky and a short encounter with attending politicians, the 
presidential couple left for an audience with the emperor and 
empress at the Imperial Palace. 
  Ways to avert an open confrontation over North Korea's 
alleged nuclear program are the main focus of Kim's talks in 
Japan and with Chinese leaders later. 
  He told Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who welcomed the 
president at Tokyo's Haneda Airport, that "Russia's cooperation 
is necessary" to solve the dispute stemming from North Korea's 
refusal of full inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
  In response Hata, who returned from talks in Russia on 
Monday, told Kim that Moscow seems to be dissatisfied with 
Pyongyang's reactions, Japanese officials said. 
  North Korea says its nuclear program is strictly 
nonmilitary. 
  On Wednesday, Kim put South Korea's 650,000-strong army 
under 
special alert after North Korea warned that Washington's 
decision to dispatch six Patriot antimissile batteries to the 
south will push the Korean peninsula "to the brink of war." 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, originally scheduled to 
accompany Kim, withdrew from the traveling party on short notice 
Wednesday probably due to the increasingly tense situation on 
the Korean peninsula. 
  Kim's Japan visit will be directly followed by a five-day 
state visit to China, starting Saturday afternoon. 
  In a departure ceremony at Seoul airport Thursday, Kim said 
he will try to obtain support from Japan and China to resolve 
the nuclear issue and bring North Korea around to reform and 
openness. 
  "I will explain to the two leaders of Japan and China that 
preserving reconciliation and peace on the Korean peninsula is 
important to ensuring stability and prosperity in the 
Asia-Pacific region as well as in Northeast Asia," Kim said. 
  He said North Korea had created confrontation on the Korean 
peninsula by failing to allow unhindered inspections of its 
nuclear facilities and make progress in inter-Korean dialogue. 
"While keeping the channel of dialogue open, South Korea, with 
the firm security commitment of the United States, is also fully 
determined to fight against any possible provocation by North 
Korea," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 (YONHAP) -- North Korea is willing 
to reopen talks with the United States if the latter offers to 
suspend joint military exercises with South Korea and tries to 
solve the nuclear problem through dialogue, a Pyongyang official 
at the United Nations was quoted as saying Wednesday. 
  KYODO NEWS SERVICE reported from New York that the North 
Korean official indicated his government would allow additional 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) if 
the United States came to the negotiating table. 
  The official offered neither a confirmation nor a denial 
when 
asked if North Korea and the United States had been in contact 
since the nuclear issue was referred to the UN Security Council. 
  "No comment," he was quoted as saying. 
  Washington canceled its scheduled March 21 high-level talks 
with Pyongyang after the Stalinist state refused to allow full 
nuclear inspections by the IAEA. 
  The agency has referred the matter to the Security Council, 
which is preparing a resolution on North Korea for next week. 
Seoul and Washington, meanwhile, are seriously considering 
resumption of their joint military exercises "Team Spirit" this 
year. 
  The North Korean official expressed high hopes on the stance 
of Beijing, which has openly declared its opposition to any 
harsh action against Pyongyang such as sanctions. 
  "We have maintained friendly relations for over 40 years 
since the Korean war," KYODO quoted him as saying. "We will 
continue to strengthen these relations."

  [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri has been invited 
to Burma in his capacity as chairman of ASEAN's standing 
committee and efforts are under way for him to visit in 
mid-April, senior officials said yesterday. 
  The invitation came from Burmese Foreign Minister U Ohn 
Gyaw, 
and was delivered to Squadron Leader Prasong after he returned 
from Hanoi on Saturday, the officials added. 
  Burma's Ambassador to Thailand U Phone Myint delivered the 
invitation the officials noted. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong spoke of the invitation from Rangoon during 
talks in Canberra yesterday with Australian shadow foreign 
minister Andrew Peacock. 
  As part of a four-day visit to Australia, Sqn Ldr Prasong 
also met Defence Minister Robert Ray and paid a courtesy call on 
Prime Minister Paul Keating yesterday. 
  According to a Thai Foreign Ministry report, Mr Peacock 
expressed the view that Sqn Ldr Prasong should accept the 
invitation from Rangoon. 
  Officials in Bangkok said details of the trip would be 
worked 
out after Sqn Ldr Prasong returns this weekend from visits to 
Australia and New Zealand. 
  Senior officials of the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN) two weeks ago agreed to invite Burma, in the 
capacity of a non-participating "guest", to attend the annual 
meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers in Bangkok in July. 
  The ASEAN ministers made clear that Burma's foreign minister 
would be a "guest" of host country Thailand, not of the grouping 
as a whole. 
  During talks in Canberra yesterday Foreign Minister Prasong 
called the ASEAN decision the start of an effort to bring Burma 
out of isolation, the Thai Foreign Ministry report said. 
  The minister made the point when the Australian side raised 
questions about "constructive engagement" with Rangoon, the 
report added. 
  "On the question of Burma, Australia and Thailand do not 
differ on principles of democratic government and problems of 
human rights," the report noted. "However, methods may differ 
because Thailand has a common border with Burma," the report 
said. 
  On Cambodia, Foreign Minister Prasong reiterated that 
Thailand recognises the elected government and supports a 
political solution to the current strife in the country, the 
report noted. 
  "The Thai side believes political means should be applied to 
solve problems in Cambodia because there will be protracted 
fighting if the government side seizes territory and the Khmer 
Rouge employ guerrilla tactics to resist," the report added.

  [Text] Ann Griffiths, executive director of the U.S. 
National League of POW/MIA Families [NLPMF] visited Vietnam from 
22-24 March. During her visit, she met with Deputy Foreign 
Minister Le Mai and held discussion on issues related to the MIA 
with representatives of the Ministries of Defense and Interior, 
the Vietnam MIA Office, and the U.S. MIA Office in Hanoi. 
  On 23 March, Mrs. Griffiths paid a courtesy call on Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet at the Government Office. During the 
meeting, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said: The Vietnamese 
Government has always regarded the search for Americans missing 
in action as a humanitarian issue which is in line with the 
Vietnamese people's tradition. The Vietnamese Government, past 
and present, has done its best in searching for MIAs. The 
Vietnamese Government will continue its best efforts to carry 
out this task in the days ahead. The government also urges 
people in localities throughout the country to report to the 
authorities all information which are of interest to families of 
the American MIA. 
  The prime minister also said he hoped to receive new, 
positive, and effective cooperation from the NLPMF in searching 
for American and Vietnamese soldiers missing in action. He 
stressed that this is a compensation for the losses experienced 
by both sides in the past.

impose a total ban on the dumping of industrial waste in Third 
World countries, particularly Asia. The prime minister said 
that those countries should in fact take steps to end the export 
of industrial waste to developing countries. He felt that 
industrial waste should not be exported to developing countries 
because [words indistinct]. 
  He told reporters this after visiting the Kuala Lumpur Tower 
project at Bukit Nanas in Kuala Lumpur. Dr. Mahathir was asked 
to comment on the claim by Green Peace, an environmental 
protection group, that seven industrialized countries oppose the 
efforts to impose a total ban on the export of industrial waste 
to Third World countries. The countries are Australia, Britain, 
Canada, Germany, Holland, Japan, and the United States. When he 
was asked to comment on the protests by international 
organizations against Malaysia's ban on the Oscar-winning movie 
Schindler's List, he said the people outside the country should 
not object to the decision because it was Malaysia's right to 
ban any film in the country. On a Jewish organization's claim 
that the film was banned because he was anti-Semitic, Dr. 
Mahathir said he was not anti-Semitic but he was anti- Zionist 
expansionism and the conquest of Arab territory by the (?Jews).

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of interview with Foreign Minister Datuk </F>
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi by STRAITS TIMES correspondent Ismail 
Kassim in Kuala Lumpur; date not given] 
  [Text] On the pluses and minuses of Malaysia's 
pro-active foreign policy: 
  [Badawi] To be credible, we have to conduct our policy with 
integrity and honesty. If we are not popular as a result of 
that, it is just a consequence. Whatever action we take is not 
meant to make us popular. 
  The bottomline is that it's a plus for us... 
  But we don't go round on the basis of counting pluses and 
minuses. From my assessment, more people appreciated and 
approved of our actions than disapproved. 
  On the impact of such an approach on neighbours and 
friends: 
  [Badawi] We cannot pursue a policy purely on the basis of 
what our friends want us to do. As an independent and sovereign 
nation, we have the right to voice our views in any 
international forum and we have expressed them loud and clear. 
But we do not do it on the basis of wanting to compete with 
others. 
  We are also very responsive to suggestions from other 
leaders. We have never held back our support for any good idea 
that came from anybody... 
  On Malaysia being the odd-man-out in ASEAN over the 
future of APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation], a 17-member 
grouping: 
  [Badawi] I don't think so. If I understand (Indonesian 
Foreign Minister) Ali Alatas, I don't think Indonesia is ready 
for a more formal structure. I have been assured that Singapore 
too does not want anything big. 
  If we are not careful, the development of APEC could lead to 
the diminution of sub-regional cooperation. That's why Malaysia 
has been speaking up -- because we want to make sure that ASEAN 
is not swallowed. We do not want ASEAN to lose its identity and 
its effectiveness. 
  We have taken a pro-ASEAN position. We want to preserve and 
promote ASEAN because we value ASEAN cooperation which has 
proven verv successful. 
  We do not reject APEC. We will participate in its meeting 
and we will implement whatever projects we are involved in. But 
we do not believe APEC should be structured with a big 
secretariat like a mini-United Nations. 
  On the attendance of Finance Minister Datuk Sri Anwar 
Ibrahim at the APEC finance ministers meeting this week, and Dr. 
Mahathir's likely presence at the Jakarta APEC summit later this 
year: 
  [Badawi] We have been assured that it is (the finance 
ministers meeting) going to be a one-off meeting, not an annual 
affair. That's why Datuk Anwar went in his capacity as finance 
minister, not as the deputy premier. 
  Dr. Mahathir is also likely to go to Jakarta. Whatever 
happens after that, we don't know. 
  My fear is that the APEC summit might be an annual event. I 
think there will be many countries anxious to hold this kind of 
gathering. But our position remains unchanged. 
  In ASEAN, we respect our differences over this issue. It has 
not divided us yet and there's still continuing cooperation. On 
some pressing issues, we can still reach consensus. 
  But we are actually worried of what may happen in the 
future. 
  On reports that American officials are urging Japanese 
and Koreans privately not to join the EAEC [East Asian Economic 
Caucus] despite the Clinton administration dropping its 
opposition to the caucus which excludes the United States: 
  [Badawi] I don't want to use harsh words such as hypocrisy. 
But this is the kind of double-game diplomacy that we don't 
want. One plays at the net, the other lobbying from the 
backline. 
  I will go by what Warren Christopher said in Singapore in 
his 
official capacity not as a private person. 
  (During the ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference in Singapore 
last July, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher declared 
that "the United States now views the development of the EAEC 
with interest and without hostility, and hopes that the EAEC 
would enhance a more open trading system".) 
  It was not an off-the-cuff remark he made in some corner of 
the world in response to a reporter's question. So we have to 
hold on to his words. 
  We hope that the first meeting of EAEC at an appropriate 
level can be held by the end of this year. 
  On the repercussions of the current row with Britain 
which began after the London SUNDAY TIMES newspaper began 
implying that Malaysian government leaders, including Dr. 
Mahathir, were corrupt: 
  [Badawi] We are monitoring it very closely. At the moment, 
nothing adverse yet. 
  On our part, we have no fear in dealing with any government 
which speaks on what it believes in. I don't think other 
countries have any problem with us. It's a not a minus point 
for Malaysia to stand up for its beliefs. After all, we are not 
tearing up any contract that has been signed. 
  Every issue will be resolved eventually. I am in no position 
to predict when this can happen. See what happened with 
Australia. All the noises and then it all ended amicably. 
  Neither Malaysia nor Britain wants to do anything to worsen 
the situation. 
On his first official visit to Singapore from tomorrow and 
bilateral relations: 
  [Badawi] Well, we are so close, we don't normally make state 
visits. I don't think [former prime minister] Tun Razak or Tun 
Hussein made any official visit to Singapore. Likewise, Lee 
Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong too have never made an official visit 
to Malaysia. 
  As to my trip, it is like dropping into a neighbour's semi- 
detached house for tea. I have been going in and out and 
passing through all the time, so Kan Seng (former Singapore 
Foreign Minister Wong Kan Seng, who is now in Home Affairs) 
suggested that I drop in for a chat. 
  There isn't anything intimidating about the visit. I am not 
going to talk about the dispute over Pulau Batu Putih (Pedra 
Branca). 
  The meeting of officials to resolve it has been going on. 
They have their own schedule. I am not going to interfere. 
  As to other problems, I can't think of any.

  [Text] The F88 Democratic Front in Burma yesterday issued 
a statement saying they are willing to hold political talks with 
the State Law and Order Restoration Committee (Slorc), the 
Burmese military junta. 
  But they want to be represented at the talks by their leader 
Aung San Suu Kyi who has been under house arrest since shortly 
after her National League for Democracy's land-slide election 
victory in 1989. 
  But A Burmese student source said the statement was issued 
following the F88's brainstorm meeting from March 18 to 21 at a 
border area opposite Mae Hong Son province. However, leaders of 
dissident ethnic minority groups, including Gen Bo Mya of the 
Karen National Union, did not take part in the meeting. 
  But The F88 comprises the All Burmese Students Democratic 
Front, the Government in Exile and monks taking refuge in Karen 
National Union's zones. 
  But The statement said the group wants to hold talks with 
the 
military government on political issues brought up previously by 
Suu Kyi and they want her to lead opposition groups in the talks. 
  But Suu Kyi has demanded the junta step down and hand over 
power. 
  But She has also said the judicial system should be free of 
intimidation or coercion, the military should be under 
government control and should not be allowed to disrupt the 
constitutional process once it is in place. 
  But The F88 statement the F88 statement denounced the 
ceasefire agreement between ethnic minorities and the State Law 
and Order Restoration Committee (Slorc) as not bringing a 
political solution. [sentence as published] 
  But The group said ethnic minorities were forced into 
ceasefire negotiations by Burma's neighbours add Asean. 
  But They also accused China of helping the junta maintain 
its 
grip on powers by providing the junta with political, economic 
and military support. 
  But The statement also blasted the military junta's failure 
to tackle the country's economic woes and accused the junta of 
working solely for vested interest groups and its own survival 
in power. 
  But "After all, the country is still plagued with economic 
recession, inflation and high prices," it said. 
  But The F88 statement came a day after the National 
Convention to draft a new constitution was convened in Rangoon. 
The convention was initiated a year ago. The military junta 
says the promulgation of a new constitution is conditional to 
its handing over to a civilian government. 
  But The opening day of the plenary session on Wednesday was 
confined to papers put up by the minorities' representative 
syndicate, a group which represents the country's ethnic groups. 
  But Among 14 representatives of minority groups to speak 
during the session, a representative from Chin State, U Kan Yin, 
demanded Burma be declared a federal state. 
  But He said state power should come from the people and 
ethnic minorities should receive equal treatment to the Burmans, 
the country's majority. 
  But Gyaw Pan Tha of Arakan state demanded self 
administration 
for those ethnic minorities who have no states or divisions of 
their own. These included the Naga, Pa-O, Palaung, Kokan, 
Alkar, Kayar and Wa minorities. 
  But The Kokangs, Was, and Pa-Os, who live in Shan State 
bordering China, and the Nagas in the Sagaing Division bordering 
India, were among the groups which claimed they met criteria for 
self administration. 
  But The convention is intended to spark "national 
reconciliation" among Burma's various races and create a 
power-sharing role for the military which has been in power for 
the last five years. 
  But The convention has already adopted 104 "fundamental 
principles," including provisions entitling ethnic minorities to 
their own language, literature and culture and to 
"self-administered areas, zones and divisions", if their numbers 
are judged to be adequate.

  [Editorial Report] Rangoon Burma Television Network in 
Burmese at 1330 GMT on 24 March carries a 50-minute report on 
the 24 March plenary session of the National Convention to draw 
up the basic principles for drafting the new constitution held 
in the Central Meeting Hall of the President's Residence 
compound on Ahlone Road in Rangoon. The report includes 
extracts of the proposal papers read by 13 delegates at this 
morning's session on the three chapter headings on the state, 
state structure, and head of state. 
  The proposal paper prepared by the group representing 
peasants was read by U Shwe Hla and U Kyaw Aye. U Shwe Hla of 
Rakhine State proposes that a basic principle be prescribed to 
declare Rangoon the state capital and a "Union territory under 
the direct administration of the president" due to its unique 
position as the seat of government and its importance for the 
country's defense and security, economy, and international 
communications. He also suggests that "other areas with unique 
conditions, such as the Coco Islands, be declared Union 
territory under the direct administration of the president." 
  Next, U Kyaw Aye of Karen State continues reading the report 
dealing with qualifications for president -- loyalty, genuine 
citizen born of parents who are citizens, appropriate age -- and 
the election of president through the electoral college composed 
of all members of Parliament who will be separated into three 
groups. The three groups are: "The first group is composed of 
members of the chamber of Parliament who are elected based on 
equal representation from states and divisions; the second group 
is composed of members of the chamber of Parliament based on 
population; the third group is composed of members of Defense 
Services nominated by the commander in chief of the Defense 
Services to the two chambers of Parliament." 
  Next, the proposal paper prepared by the group representing 
workers is read by U Kyaw Win Tun of Mandalay Division, 
explaining the need to include perpetuation of existing national 
territory as a basic principle in the constitution. U Kyi Myint 
of Pegu Division continues reading the workers group report 
dealing with the state structure and prescription of 
self-administrative divisions and self-administrative zones. 
  U Aung San of Magwe division continues reading the workers 
group report suggesting the president be elected by the 
electoral college composed of three groups of members of 
Parliament. 
  Next, U Sam Lut Naw of Kachin State repesenting the workers 
group read his paper. Addressing the issue of whether the 
Convention delegates can determine which national groups are 
entitled to self- administered zones or self-administered 
divisions and in which states and divisions, U Sam Lut Naw says 
this matter cannot be determined by the delegates. He says "the 
basic principle unanimously endorsed by the delegates calls for 
prescription of self-adminsitered areas for national groups if 
they have an appropriate number of population living 
collectively in a congruous territory. It says based on the 
size of population and extent of the territory, the status of 
self-administered divisons or self-administered zones are to be 
granted as appropriate." He says, however, the delegates do not 
have at their disposal data on the size of population and 
territory to determine the self-adminstration status. He says: 
"The delegates do not know what constitutes an appropriate 
population size, and they cannot decide on the matter. 
Furthermore, he says the delegates do not know which national 
groups have asked for status of self-administered division or 
zone. He says the delegates do not know which national groups, 
out of 135 national groups, want self-administered divisions or 
zones. As for the requirement for living collectively in a 
congruous territory, the delegates have no knowledge. The 
delegates also have no knowledge of geographical location and 
dimension. Therefore, I believe the status of self-administered 
division or zone can be determined only after the knowledge is 
obtained on the aforementioned two unknown points. [applause]. 
Therefore, I propose that it is only appropriate for the state 
to form a commission to decide on the issue of self-administered 
areas." 
  Continuing, U Sam Lut Naw, worker representative of the 
Kachin State, addresses the issue of election of president. He 
says: "Even major countries in the world only have one president 
and one vice president. The population and territory of the 
Union of Myanmar [Burma] are not big. Therefore, there should 
not be two vice presidents but one president and one vice 
president. [applause] Also, there should be only two groups in 
the Electoral College without a group composed of members of 
Defense Services nominated by the commander in chief of the 
Defense Services to the two chambers of Parliament. The two 
vice presidents should be elected by two groups of the Electoral 
College composed of members of two chambers of Parliament. 
[number as heard] [applause] Members of Parliament from the 
Defense Services nominated by the commander in chief of the 
Defense Services are already included in the two chambers of 
Parliament." 
  In the recorded portions of delegates speeches carried on 23 
and 24 March, U Sam Lut Naw is the only delegate to have 
received applause for his speech. In this session, the 
recording of his speech was interrupted by applause four times. 
  Next, U Min Naing, an artist, reads the report of the group 
representing intelligentsia and intellectuals. The report 
suggests the additional principle -- that "the state is a state 
where indigenous fraternal national people live in unity through 
weal and woe" and the term "Myanmar" refers to all national 
groups residing in the state -- be added to the already accepted 
four principles concerning sovereignty, government, territory, 
and population. The report also suggests that a national group, 
regardless of whether or not they obtain the self-administered 
status, should have the right to participate in their regional 
affairs and to freely preserve the language, literature, 
culture, customs, and traditions they cherish according to the 
law. The report also calls for prevention of exploitation of 
one race by another. 
  Continuing the report, Henzada U Myint Wai proposes that 
three groups of the Electoral College elect the country's 
president and two vice presidents. The report also proposes 
that the president be elected in the last month of the third 
quarter of the fiscal year to give sufficient time to the 
president to attend to financial matters. 
  Next, the report prepared by the group representing public 
servants is read by U Maung Maung of the Ministry of Hotel and 
Tourist Industry. The report proposes to include the provision: 
"Myanmar is a sovereign and independent state" in the chapter on 
the state in order safeguard and uphold national sovereignty and 
independence. 
  Continuing the report, U Yan Naing Aung of the Ministry of 
Agriculture, proposes that areas of strategic, economic, and 
administrative importance be declared as "Union territories 
under the direct administration of president." Addressing the 
issue of granting self-administered areas, U Yan Naing Aung 
expresses the view "that it is not appropriate for a national 
group, which already has the status of region or state, to 
demand the status of self- administered division or 
self-administered zone in another region or state." He says 
similarly, if a national group has been granted a 
self-adminstered zone or self-administered division in a state 
or division, it is not appropriate to grant self-administered 
zone or self-administered division status to the same national 
group in another state or region. 
  Next, Dr. Kyaw Win of the Ministry of Health continues 
reading the report of the public servants. The report proposes 
the corollary to "the basic principle that the president must be 
loyal to the nation and its citizens, the president or one of 
his parents, or his spouse, or any of his legal children, or 
spouse of any of his legal children shall not owe allegiance to 
a foreign power or serve a foreign power and shall not be a 
citizen of a foreign country." The report also proposes that the 
president be well versed in the national affairs to have correct 
judgement and effective leadership. The report also proposes 
that the president meet the residency requirements of at least 
20 years in the country. 
  Lieutenant Colonel Tin Kha of the Defense Ministry continues 
with the report of the public servants. The report deals with 
the 37 basic principles proposed by the group dealing with 
citizenship, term of office of the president, requirement for 
president and vice president to resign from a social or 
religious organization from the date of his election, and 
qualifications for president and vice president. The report 
says the group representing public servants gives priority to 
emergence of a modern and developed state. 
  The plenary session ends at 1605 after the submission of the 
reports.

  [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur -- Singapore is prepared to develop 
linkages with regional economic groupings such as the North 
America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to help take forward the 
process of open regionalism, Trade and Industry Minister Yeo 
Cheow Tong said yesterday. 
  Link-ups between the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), NAFTA and 
other countries such as Australia were the sort of 
inter-regional ties which could ensure that economic groupings 
in the Asia-Pacific region remained part of an open global 
trading system, he said. 
  He was speaking on the opening day of the 10th general 
meeting of the Pacific Economic Co-operation Council (PECC) on 
"Open Regionalism: The Way Forward". 
  Under AFTA, the six ASEAN countries will reduce their taxes 
and tariffs on trade between them to 5 per cent or less by 2008. 
NAFTA is a comprehensive free trade area comprising the United 
States,Canada, and Mexico. 
  Mr. Yeo told reporters yesterday that Singapore hoped an 
AFTA-NAFTA link could be developed along the lines of ASEAN's "6 
minus X" formula. 
  Under this formula, those which are ready to proceed do so, 
while the others can join when they are ready. 
  He was elaborating on his comment during the Pacific leaders 
forum on open regionalism that while an AFTA-NAFTA linkage would 
take time to develop, "we are prepared to take smaller steps 
first". 
  He proposed in his speech that "concentric and overlapping 
circles of linkages" could reconcile regionalism with 
multilateralism and prevent the danger of trade blocs developing. 
  Singapore's concentric circles range from its Growth 
Triangle 
with immediate neighbours, Indonesia and Malaysia, through AFTA 
to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) grouping, he 
said. 
  While all this collaboration was of mutual benefit to those 
involved, "economic relations cannot be conducted on the basis 
of strict geometry". 
  "These concentric circles of linkages have to be 
complemented 
by linkages that overlap or stretch across circles," he said. 
[passage omitted on Thai deputy prime minister's speech] 
  PECC's member committees come from the ASEAN countries, 
Australia, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Hong Kong, Japan, 
South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Russia, Taiwan, the 
United States, and the Pacific island nations.

  [Text] Minister of Commerce Uthai Phimchaichon told the 
10th international general meeting of the Pacific Economic 
Cooperation Council that the setting of the ASEAN Free Trade 
Area, or AFTA, is needed to promote the current multilateral 
trade system in the region. Minister Uthai made the remarks in 
his speech to about 600 representatives from 21 countries in 
Asia and the Pacific at the conference held in Malaysia during 
22 to 24 March 1994. He said while countries in the world have 
moved since 1980 toward groupings as regional trade blocs and 
Europe has already declared its single market in 1990, the Asian 
region should consider the ASEAN Free Trade Area, or AFTA, to 
increase its efficiency to survive and take advantage of the 
ASEAN wide market. 
  He recommended that AFTA be a potential tool for trade 
promotion in the region. He said that the free trade system 
will lead the Asian region and ASEAN to the world market as well 
as to induce foreign investors to the region.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA March 24 -- General Secretary Do Muoi held 
a cordial meeting with delegates attending the 10th General 
Meeting of Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (GMPECC) in 
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. On behalf of the participants, Mr. 
Zainal Abidin Sulong, president of the GMPECC welcomed Mr Do 
Muoi and hailed the achievements recorded by the Vietnamese 
people during their current renovation process. He stressed 
that Vietnam has gained a number of achievements on economic, 
cultural and social fields. Vietnam is now a promising and 
dynamic country. He also praised Vietnamese open-door foreign 
policy and held that Vietnam has made great contribution to the 
stability, cooperation and development in the region as well as 
in the world. After that General Secretary Do Muoi addressed at 
the GMPECC. Followings are main parts of his speech: 
  We Vietnamese have always been conscious that Vietnam is an 
inseparable part of the Pacific, and together with the peoples 
on the rim of this vital ocean area, we have always shared the 
sorrows at disasters and the joys at good opportunities brought 
about to the region. 
  In observing the development curves on the Pacific Rim, we 
are deeply aware that as a country with thousands of years of 
history, endowed with rich and diversified resources, a very 
favourable geographic location and a people who are undaunted in 
struggle and industrious in labour, Vietnam has the conditions 
to quickly reach a high standard of development. 
  However, for the past nearly half a century, while other 
nations were enjoying peace and had favourable conditions to 
develop, the Vietnamese had to undergo one brutal war after 
another and suffered from enormous sacrifices to regain and 
defend their national independence and freedom, and to liberate 
and unify their country. A huge amount of bombs and ammunitions 
which exceeded even that used throughout World War II, was 
dropped on the small country of Vietnam, leaving our people in 
untold sufferings and lasting heavy consequences. 
  I have no intention to disturb your souls with this reminder 
amid this peaceful atmosphere in Kuala Lumpur, but only wish to 
say that the Vietnamese people have paid dear price to regain 
their most fundamental and sacred right as human beings, namely 
to live in independence and freedom that the Vietnamese people, 
not less than anyone else, long for a peaceful life to do all 
they can to build a prosperous country and that such an 
undaunted nation fully deserves a life of plenty and happiness. 
  It is with such a consciousness that we have persistently 
pursued our policy of `renewal' to mobilize all resources of the 
society, tap to all potentials of the people and, at the same 
time, broaden our international cooperation along the line of 
diversification and multilateralization to materialize our goal 
of becoming `a rich people, a strong country and an equitable 
and civilized society'. 
  We have made important initial achievements. Despite the 
major upheavals in the world, the profound changes in the 
countries of our traditional trading partners and the embargo, 
the Vietnamese economy never collapsed but has, on the contrary, 
shown upturns. From a country of chronic food shortages, having 
to import hundreds of thousands of tons of food a year, Vietnam 
has now become a food exporter, selling each year from 1.5 to 2 
million tons of rice. The hyper-inflation which used to 
register at triple digits in the mid-1980's has gone down to 
only over 5 a year. In the meantime, the GDP has clocked an 
average annual increase of over 7 over the past three years and 
is laying the premise for a still higher growth in the coming 
years. 
  These achievements result from the self-sacrifices in labour 
of our people, and of our persistent policy for all-round 
renewal that has enjoyed the warm response from, and zealous 
implementation by, our entire people. They also result from the 
heartfelt support and assistance of our friends around the 
world. From this rostrum, I would like to express our sincere 
gratitude for that valuable support and assistance. The cause 
we are pursuing has no precedent. We, have thus to strenuously 
promote our sense of independence and sovereignty, and our 
creativity in research and carefulness in development, giving 
priority to economic renewal while carrying out political 
renewal in appropriate forms and with suitable steps. To catch 
up with the common momentum of development and gradually bridge 
the gap between our country and others in the region, we 
continue to consider economic development our central task, and 
will persist in our policy of all-round renewal and our open 
foreign policy of diversification and multilateralization.

  [Text] Vietnam said it will join ASEAN only when its 
membership in the grouping benefits all ASEAN and Vietnam. Do 
Muoi, the general secretary of the Vietnam Communist Party, said 
this at a question and answer session with participants of the 
10th general meeting of the Pacific Economic Cooperation 
Council, PECC, in Kuala Lumpur this evening. He said Vietnam is 
currently studying the ASEAN working mechanism and will join the 
group when the situation is right. Mr. Do Muoi also said that 
ASEAN can contribute greatly to the rebuilding and modernization 
of Vietnam. He pointed out ASEAN can contribute to the economic 
well-being of Vietnam, especially in terms of technology. He 
hoped ASEAN member countries will invest more in Vietnam. 
  Malaysia is currently the 10th largest investor in Vietnam 
with a total investment of 400 million U.S. dollars. 
  When asked for Vietnam's opinion on the dispute over the 
Spratly Islands, Mr. Do Muoi said that all parties concerned in 
the claim to the islands should resort to action that will not 
raise tension in the region. He reiterated that the issue 
should be resolved either through bilateral or multilateral 
meetings.

  [Text] An Indonesian expert has predicted that demand for 
satellite transponders in the Asia-Pacific region will grow 
consistently in the near term, but suggested that those planning 
new systems should take the time to do more comprehensive 
studies. 
  Currently, only 64 per cent available satellite capacity is 
in use. 
  In a presentation before a Pacific Economic Cooperation 
Council (PECC) meeting, Wahyu Wi Jayadi, general manager of the 
Medan Division of PT Indosat Indonesia, said that with such a 
level of utilization, the tendency for each country or even 
private company to have its own system will increase competition 
among satellite capacity providers despite continued growth in 
demand. New system planners must be wary. 
  Speaking on the topic "The Emerging Demand for Satellite 
Communications in the Pacific Rim", Wijayadi said, "There is no 
doubt that the demand for satellite transponders in the 
Asia-Pacific region will grow considerably in the near future. 
The demand is driven by several factors such as globalization, 
a trend which is (influencing) more and more sectors; the (high 
economic) growth in most Asia-Pacific countries and the climate 
of deregulation in the telecommunications industry which has 
become more concrete." 
  Another significant factor contributing to growing demand 
for 
satellite communication systems is the development of TV 
broadcasting systems in the region, he added. 
  In line with the rapid economic growth in the region, the 
International Telecommunications Union estimated that around 
US$100 billion will be invested in regional telecommunications 
development between 1992 and 2000. 
  The second factor is the pressing need to rectify the 
mismatch between demand and supply for access to a simple dial 
tone. Nearly 3 billion people in the Asia-Pacific region have 
access to only a little more than 115 million lines, translating 
to about one telephone line for every 26 people. 
  "Anticipating the future conditions of world economics, one 
of the tools that every country races to develop is a satellite 
communications system," he said. 
  Historically, most telecommunications operators in 
Asia-Pacific have been government or state-owned companies with 
a monopoly market structure. In order to catch up with 
developments in technology and consumer expectations of better 
quality service, governments have been forced to rethink these 
monopolies and to restructure the regulatory framework of the 
telecommunications sector in each country. The general 
objectives of the public sector in deregulating 
telecommunications are to improve the quality of services to the 
public and businesses, to create a climate more responsive to 
market demand, to encourage technological innovation in creating 
new services, to achieve a competitive tariff structure, to 
expand telecommunications businesses and find alternative 
sources to finance these developments. 
  In a dramatic development for broadcasters, satellites are 
being used to transmit television programmes. Several 
broadcasters using the technology have established a significant 
presence in the Asia-Pacific region--STAR TV, Prime Spot, MTV 
Asia, BBC World Service and others. This trend will also 
contribute to the growth in demand for satellite communications. 
  In the past, the telecommunications industry has not been 
customer driven, suppliers traditionally decided what their 
users would have and provided it to them as a service without 
alternatives. The industry has largely operated on the 
principle that supply creates demand. Market segmentation and 
the tailoring of products and services for specific customers 
have been precluded by regulations and by the complacency of 
non-competitive,industries. 
  But Wijayadi predicted that customers will have increasing 
influence as deregulation and technological development continue. 
  "End users of telecommunications must be viewed as 
customers. 
These consumers now have choices, and their applications driven 
needs for sophisticated telecommunications capabilities will 
exert pressure on vendors to respond to market demand." 
  A significant factor in the growing power of customers is 
the 
changing role of the telecommunications management function in 
client organizations. These changes are outlined in the 
accompanying table. 
  Satellite communications services in the Asia-Pacific region 
are served by several satellite systems including Intelsat and 
Inmarsat. There are four domestic Intelsat satellites in the 
Indian Ocean region providing public communications services 
such as telephone, telex facsimile and new Intelsat service such 
as IBS, IDR, Vista. 
  "Satellite communications systems are entering an era of 
increasing competition with more advanced technology. Global 
competitions have the tendency to be more unpredictable, and so 
it has become in the Asia-Pacific region," he noted.

<F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>
  [Text] Relations between Australia and Malaysia are 
healthy. That's the view of the Australian trade minister, Bob 
McMullan. He is the first government member to visit Malaysia 
since Prime Minister Paul Keating's reference to Dr. Mahathir as 
recalcitrant threatened trade and diplomatic links. Indeed, 
despite Prime Minister Mahathir's apparent sensitivity to 
outside criticism, Senator McMullan said he would strongly 
encourage Australian business to invest in Malaysia. Trevor 
Watson reports from the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur: 
  [Begin recording] [Watson] Malaysia's Trade Minister Rafidah 
Aziz met with Senator McMullan in the room she used for 
discussions with the minister's predecessor, Peter Cook, at the 
height of last year's row. While those earlier talks were 
charged with Malaysian threats and, I understand, Australian 
counterthreats of trade sanctions, Senator McMullan simply 
described his meeting as very useful. The new trade minister 
was reluctant to dwell on the crisis of last December, 
preferring to point out that bilateral trade grew by 30 percent 
in 1993, and is now worth $2 billion [currency not specified] a 
year. 
  [McMullan] There are the jobs of thousands of people in each 
country dependent upon the success of our trade, and so we are 
both working to maintain and build on that success. 
  [Watson] How would you characterize the relationship now, 
sir? 
  [McMullan] Oh, I think it is a successful working bilateral 
relationship which is very successful at a trade level and is 
healthy at all those other things that are part of relationship 
between neighbors -- to do with tourism, cultural exchange -- 
but the strength of the relationship is the commercial, the 
trade, the investment relationship, and that is very strong and 
rapidly growing, 1993 was a year of outstanding growth in trade 
between our two countries. 
  [Watson] While Malaysia could have suffered serious trade, 
investment, and employment losses, Kaula Lumpur was prepared 
last December to threaten links with Australia over Paul 
Keating's remarks. In the end, the prime minister said he 
regretted the remarks and relations rapidly returned to normal. 
Now it's Britain that's bearing the brunt of Dr. Mahathir's 
wrath. Last month, Kuala Lumpur announced that in future 
British firms would be barred from government contracts in 
retaliation for London media allegations of high-level 
corruption in Malaysia. The move could cost British industry 
billions of dollars. Given that so much can hinge on a loose 
word from a foreign leader or a newspaper article, would Senator 
McMullan encourage Australian business to invest in Malaysia? 
  [McMullan] Yes, we are encouraging Australian business to 
invest throughout the region, we've consciously, as a matter.... 
[pauses] The government has consciously done research and 
released a report showing that more investment in this region 
will lead to more trade and create more jobs. So we encourage 
people to do it. It's a question for any individual company 
where their corporate strategy and their view of whether they 
might make a profit is where they should invest and if that 
happens to be Malaysia well then we will recommend that they do 
it. 
  [Watson] Dr. Mahathir now says he may consider lifting the 
ban on British firms when the British press stops telling lies 
about Malaysia. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Felix Soh] </F>
  [Text] Malaysia has proposed that workers involved in 
Growth Triangle projects should be allowed easier movement 
between the three countries. 
  Malaysian Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said 
yesterday that he raised this matter during talks with Singapore 
leaders. 
  Speaking at a press conference at the end of his two-day 
official visit here, he said he had also suggested that 
arrangements be made to facilitate the speedy crossing of the 
Causeway for tourists from Malaysia and Singapore. 
  Datuk Abdullah, who was here at the invitation of his 
Singapore counterpart Professor S.Jayakumar, yesterday met Prime 
Minister Goh Chok Tong and had a two-hour informal dialogue with 
Young PAP [People's Action Party] members. On Monday, he called 
on President Ong Teng Cheong, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, 
Deputy Prime Minister BG [Brigadier General] Lee Hsien Loong and 
Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng. 
  He said that these meetings provided an "excellent 
opportunity" for him to discuss bilateral matters as well as 
forthcoming events like the first meeting of the ASEAN Regional 
Forum in July. 
  At the press conference, Datuk Abdullah said that there 
should be closer contact between the young people of Singapore 
and Malaysia to improve their understanding of each other. 
  He disclosed that he had mooted proposals for the easier 
flow 
of the labour force working on specific projects in the three 
Growth Triangle countries, and between Singapore and Malaysia 
during his talks with Singapore ministers. 
  He said: "We want to see more projects which are established 
on the basis of bilateral and trilateral collaboration, not just 
individual country projects." 
  He elaborated: "In other words, we will have Singaporeans, 
Indonesians and Malaysians working together and experiencing a 
new cooperative effort to cultivate projects successfully. We 
can optimise the labour and skill resources and consultancy 
services available. 
  "In my view, this is the sort of modality that can become 
the 
catalyst for future closer relations between the three 
countries." 
  He said Singapore leaders had told him that they would look 
into the matter. 
  He stressed that he was not advocating a general opening of 
immigration doors. 
  Said Datuk Abdullah: "I don't want to create the 
misunderstanding that I am suggesting to my brother countries -- 
please open your doors wide and allow anyone to enter and ask 
for jobs. 
  "I am talking in terms of specific projects which have been 
set up under the name of the Southern Triangle venture so that 
those who are involved in these projects should be given the 
facility to move in and out. 
  "For example, if some Johoreans want to work in Batam or 
Singapore, then they should be allowed to move there quickly and 
come out." 
  On implementing measures to facilitate the crossing of the 
Causeway for tourists, he said the recently-completed 
North-South Highway had made it more attractive to travel by 
road to Singapore and vice-versa. "Why can't we make some 
arrangement to allow tourists to cross the border very quickly 
and not get caught at the Causeway for hours?" he asked. "The 
Causeway check-point has become a choke-point." 
  One measure, he suggested, could be prior checking in the 
city. With a special permit, passengers on a tourist bus can be 
cleared without their having to disembark for immigration checks. 
  "The point is, if you want to encourage tourism in Malaysia 
and Singapore, let's have such an arrangement so that both 
countries can benefit," he said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-chun: "We Mean What We Say"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. warmongers are escalating the policy of 
crushing [apsal] the DPRK. As has been known, U.S. President 
Clinton on 22 March ordered Patriot missiles to be deployed to 
South Korea and, accordingly, some 40 missile launch vehicles 
and the Patriot missile battalion consisting of 800 troops began 
to move from Texas toward South Korea on the same day. 
  On the same day, the U.S. Government reviewed instituting 
new 
military steps, such as dispatching additional U.S. troops to 
South Korea, forward deployment of an aircraft carrier on the 
sea off the Korean peninsula, and arming the U.S. forces in 
South Korea and the South Korean puppet army with new 
antichemical military equipment. 
  Along with these steps by the Clinton administration, the 
hardline conservative forces in the U.S. Congress as well are 
making bellicose outbursts aimed at crushing us by force of 
arms. According to foreign press, Richard Gephardt, Democratic 
Party floor leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, urged 
the U.S. Government to deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea, 
to resume the Team Spirit nuclear war exercise, and to dispatch 
additional U.S. troops to South Korea. 
  In the meantime, Robert Dole, Republican minority leader of 
the U.S. Senate, also babbled about economic sanctions against 
us and said that the United States should urgently take the next 
stage steps, such as the resumption of the Team Spirit joint 
military exercise and additional dispatch of U.S. troops to 
South Korea in order to send necessary signals to North Korea. 
  These bellicose remarks by the leaders of the two major U.S. 
parties of both houses of the U.S. Congress show that not only 
the U.S. Government authorities but also the U.S. congressmen 
are following a more reckless road. What is more important, the 
hardline conservative forces of the U.S. Congress raved about 
so-called necessary signals to our republic. 
  These bellicose maneuvers of the U.S. Government authorities 
and other high-level political figures are leading the situation 
on the Korean peninsula to a situation where a war could break 
out at any time. 
  As has been reported, the U.S. Navy fleet consisting of 30 
ships is positioned on the sea from which it can reach the 
territory of our republic in no more than 24 hours. On 22 
March, the Japan Self-Defense Forces openly conducted a field 
maneuver of Patriot missiles on the Shariki base in Aomori 
Prefecture, Japan. TOKYO SHIMBUN dated 23 March reported that 
the missiles in this base are aimed at our republic. 
  Some time ago, Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party] of the seven-party ruling coalition, who 
is known to be a behind-the-scenes controller of Japan's 
Hosokawa government, said that Japan cannot sit still if a fire 
breaks out in a neighbor's house, asserting that Japan 
Self-Defense Forces can participate as UN Forces in case of 
emergency on the Korean peninsula. From this we can infer that 
the said field maneuver with Patriot missiles by the Japan 
Self-Defense Forces manifests the fact that Japan is 
accelerating full-fledged preparations to participate directly 
in the Korean war. This is a military move which we must regard 
as very serious. 
  Meanwhile, in South Korea as well, traitor Kim Yong-sam held 
a meeting of chiefs of staff of the three services of the puppet 
armed forces on 22 March and ordered the entire puppet armed 
forces to enter an alert posture. In the wake of this order, 
frantic war exercises are continuing all over South Korea aimed 
at our Republic. 
  The peace-loving people of the world are expressing deep 
concern over this tense situation created on the Korean 
peninsula and are urging the United States to give deep thought 
to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. However, the 
United States does not listen to this demand, but continues to 
follow the road of confrontation and war. 
  However, no matter what political and diplomatic pressure 
and 
military threat and blackmail the United States may employ, they 
are unworkable to us. The more the United States puts pressure 
on us, the tougher our will to defend our sovereignty will be. 
This will of ours will turn out mightier than the U.S. nuclear 
weapon. 
  As we have already made clear, we will regard any U.S. 
sanctions as a declaration of war against us, and will strongly 
deal with it [kue kangnyokhi taechohae nagalkosimnida]. We mean 
what we say [urinun kyolko pinmarul haji anssumnida]. The U.S. 
hardline conservative forces should see the trend of the 
situation squarely and act with discretion.

<F P=106> ["U.S. Will Be Held Wholly Responsible" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- In case the situation 
develops to an irrevocable phase in the wake of the rupture of 
the DPRK-U.S. talks caused by the perfidious acts of the United 
States, the United States will be held wholly responsible for 
it, warns NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The news analyst says: 
  We can get along with or without talks with the United 
States. We are not afraid of any kind of "sanctions." 
  Grave obstacles have cropped up in the process of a peaceful 
settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and the 
atmosphere of confrontation is getting more acute in this part 
of the world. This is entirely because the United States 
reversed the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. 
contact in New York and is pursuing the purpose of stifling the 
DPRK. 
  The United States announced later than the agreed date that 
it would suspend the Team Spirit joint military maneuvers in 
1994 and open the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks on March 21. 
Worse still, when we accepted the inspection by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] for the continuity of 
safeguards and the working-level contact for the exchange of 
presidential envoys between the North and the South was resumed, 
the United States set such unreasonable preconditions as 
"satisfactory inspection by the IAEA" and "realisation of the 
exchange of presidential envoys between the North and South" 
which are not specified in the agreed conclusions. This was 
obviously a wanton violation of the New York agreement. 
  In raising the unreasonable preconditions, the United States 
sought to avoid implementing the New York agreement and, 
further, break up the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  It intends to isolate and stifle the DPRK with the nuclear 
issue and the DPRK-U.S. talks as an expedient. 
  After reversing the New York agreement, the United States 
openly revealed its intention to resume the Team Spirit 
exercises in 1994 and manipulated the dishonest quarters of the 
IAEA Secretariat to adopt an unjust "resolution" against the 
DPRK and demand a reinspection. 
  The United States has taken the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK 
to the United Nations Security Council in an attempt to 
intimidate it. 
  On the other hand, it is making a military threat to the 
DPRK 
by moving aircraft carriers and naval fleets close to the Korean 
peninsula and deciding to deploy Patriot missile units in South 
Korea. 
  The situation on the Korean peninsula is getting more grave 
hourly due to the United States and the South Korean puppets. 
  We will not allow ourselves to be a victim of the strong-arm 
policy and pressure of the United States, nor will we tolerate 
infringement on the dignity and sovereignty of the nation in any 
circumstance. 
  The United States must clearly know what the DPRK's position 
to carry into practice the measures proclaimed in the DPRK 
Government's statement of March 12 last year in face of its 
strong-arm policy and pressure means and what the consequences 
will be. 
  We do not like an empty talk, and we mean what we say. 
  We are prepared to cope with any event. 
  Those who attempt to solve the problem through a strong arm 
and pressure must know that they will not be safe, either.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
staged a provocative electronic aerial warfare exercise directed 
against the North of Korea in the air above the Oeyon islet, 
South Korea, in the daytime of March 23 with the mobilization of 
more than 200 warplanes of various types, according to military 
sources. 
  They also staged a war exercise in the air above Kapyong, 
Uijongbu, Yoju, Kunwi and Tanyang that night till early next 
morning with sorties of more than 300 fighter planes of various 
types. 
  On the 23rd, an RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane flew 
over the Military Demarcation Line area for the purpose of 
aerial photographing and electronic reconnaissance on the 
strategic interior and all other areas of the North. 
  Formations of helicopter gunships belonging to the South 
Korean puppet army which were sent to support the ground attack 
operation in Paju County staged a missile strike exercise, while 
formations of transport helicopters flew over Yonchon County and 
Chorwon County, South Korean Kangwon Province, for an airlifting 
operation. 
  Meanwhile, formations of large transport planes carrying 
many 
aggression troops and death tools flew to the U.S. Airforce 
bases in Osan and Kunsan from their overseas bases. The 
airlifted combat equipment was deployed in operational areas. 
  The war gambles of the U.S. imperialists and the South 
Korean 
puppets which are getting more reckless with each passing day 
are driving the situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink 
of war.

  [Text] Recently, military collusion and conspiracy between 
the United States and Japan have been further strengthened. 
Since such collusion and conspiracy is mainly aimed at our 
country, they are of an even more dangerous nature. 
  The United States and Japan are attempting to continually 
maintain the Japan-U.S. security treaty--the remnant of the cold 
war--on the pretext of instability on the Korean peninsula. 
  The U.S. and Japanese authorities jointly claimed at the 
first Japan-U.S. security consultative meeting held in Tokyo 
some time ago that the importance of the Japan-U.S. security 
treaty was further heightened following the cold war. 
  By raving about so-called regional instability, the United 
States is maintaining its armed forces deployed in advance areas 
in the Asian-Pacific areas including Japan, and is undisguisedly 
posing a military threat and pressuring our country. 
  Allowing the United States access to ports and land for 
military bases, Japan even offered to foot maintenance expenses. 
Furthermore, Japan welcomed the stationing of U.S. Forces--the 
basic factor for regional instability--in Japan, and is 
frantically running amok to realize its ambition of becoming a 
big military power to expand overseas with the United States on 
its back. 
  The amount of expenses shared by Japan to maintain U.S. 
Forces in Japan has increased 40 times since 1978 and reached 
$4.6 billion last year. Meanwhile, last year alone, the United 
States turned over $9 billion in military equipment required for 
the modernization of Japan's Self-Defense Forces. 
  The United States and Japan undisguisedly strengthened 
collusion and conspiratorial relations in an attempt to realize 
a theatrical missile defense system. The United States and 
Japan are even going to conclude a treaty on mutual adaptability 
[sangho yungtongsong] of materials and manpower in order for 
Japan to furnish unlimited logistical support to U.S. Forces in 
Japan in an emergency, including transportation vessels and 
manpower. 
  The U.S.-Japan military collusion against our country has 
entered a very grave phase at a time when the third round of 
DPRK-U.S. talks has been ruptured. During the period from 
mid-February to early March, troops of the 2d Division of the 
Northern District Command of Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force 
and U.S. Army troops based in the U.S. mainland staged a joint 
military exercise on the Kamihurano training ground in Hokkaido, 
Japan. The purpose of this training exercise was reportedly to 
accelerate preparations for joint operational activities by U.S. 
and Japanese troops in the event of an emergency in a cold area 
with much snowfall. 
  Since the United States ruptured DPRK-U.S. talks and 
strengthened the military threat to our country, Japan actively 
cooperated and joined U.S. maneuvers to crush our republic. As 
the United States decided to deploy Patriot missiles to South 
Korea and began provocative steps of moving the missiles, Japan, 
keeping step with this, openly staged an exercise on 22 March of 
mobilizing Patriot missiles on a Japan Air Self-Defense Force 
base in Shariki, Aomori Prefecture, in northern Honshu. 
  Japan will join the United States when the latter provokes a 
new war on the Korean peninsula. Japan's YOMIURI SHIMBUN 
exposes on 23 March the undisguised assertions for taking legal 
steps to remove restrictions in incumbent laws in order for 
Japan to support U.S. Forces in Japan in the event of a military 
clash breaking out on the Korean peninsula. 
  Japan is attempting to mobilize airplanes and ships of the 
Self-Defense Forces into South Korea under the pretext of 
evacuating Japanese residents in South Korea in the event that 
the United States starts a new war on the Korean peninsula. 
  Late last year, the Japanese Government already revised its 
law on the Self-Defense Forces on the pretext of rescuing 
Japanese residents overseas and worked out a policy on 
dispatching airplanes of Self-Defense Forces overseas. 
  U.S. naval ships, including the aircraft carriers Carl 
Vinson 
and Independence, frigates, and cruisers, are maintaining a 
posture of mobilization and deployment to the coast of the 
Korean peninsula by using Japanese bases. 
  Thus, U.S.-Japan military collusion and conspiracy which 
places our country as the main target of attack have become more 
undisguised.

  [Text] According to a broadcast report from Seoul, traitor 
Kim Yong-sam ordered a grade-A emergency alert in Seoul and 
Kyonggi Province from the morning of 23 March to the afternoon 
of 24 March and ran amok with suppressive commotion. This is 
aimed at banning the people's resistance against his traitorous 
visit to Japan. 
  The puppet traitor also ordered police throughout South 
Korea 
to step up their alertness from 23 to 30 March [duration of ROK 
President Kim Yong-sam's visits to both Japan and China]. 
  Such a frenzy of suppression reveals an ugly face of one who 
has a bad conscience due to his traitorous acts.

  [Text] According to a report by the Christian Broadcasting 
System from Seoul, the rascal called puppet Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae made a report before the puppet National Assembly 
Defense Committee on 23 March. In his report to the committee, 
he raved about someone's nonexistent provocation, babbled that 
strong retaliatory actions would be taken, and that he has 
mapped out a strategy to link this with reunification if 
necessary. 
  This is a clear incitement to achieve reunification through 
a 
northward invasion which by no accounts can ever be ignored. 
  The warmonger's blurting out about retaliatory actions 
directly means a war. In addition, his remark that this would 
be used as the opportunity to realize reunification means that 
South Korea will achieve reunification through a northward 
invasion by borrowing power from the United States. Rascal Yi 
Pyong-tae frankly admitted this time that it is mapping a 
strategy to realize the goal of invasion. 
  This clearly shows what stage the adventurous war 
provocative 
maneuvers waged against us by the Kim Yong-sam traitorous group 
have reached. 
  On 22 February, traitorous Kim Yong-sam called puppet 
military chieftains to Chongwadae [the presidential office] to 
plot a war and ordered the entire puppet Armed Forces to assume 
an emergency alert posture. Following this, the puppet defense 
minister emerged at the National Assembly and made an outburst 
agitating a northward invasion. These facts cannot on any 
account be incidental. 
  All of these facts show that the Kim Yong-sam clique, under 
the aegis of the U.S. imperialists, are captured with its 
ambition to achieve reunification by invading and thus 
prevailing over the North. In addition, these clearly expose 
the fact that its maneuvers of heightening the tension that they 
have perpetrated up to now by finding faults with our 
nonexistent nuclear issue, are a premeditated provocation to 
open the road for northward invasion.

<F P=106> ["Bellicose Remarks Revealing Scheme of Unification Through </F>
March Northward" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- South Korean "Defence 
Minister" Yi Pyong-tae, addressing the Defence Committee of the 
puppet National Assembly on March 23, cried over the fictitious 
"provocation" of the North and declared that the South "will 
react with a strong retaliation" and it "is now establishing a 
strategic conception that this will be linked to a chance of 
unification" when necessary, according to a CBS [Christian 
Broadcasting System] radio report from Seoul. 
  This is an open agitation of "unification through march 
northward" which must not go unnoticed. 
  The "retaliation" threatened by the warmaniac meant a war 
and 
"linking to a chance of unification" meant "achieving 
unification through march northward" with the help of the United 
States. Yi Pyong-tae did not trouble himself to conceal that 
his clique was working out a "strategy" to attain this 
aggressive aim. 
  This vividly shows to what extent the Kim Yong-sam traitor 
group has gone in its adventurous war provocation moves against 
the North. 
  Facts fully prove that the Kim Yong-sam group is obsessed 
with a wild ambition to achieve "unification by invading the 
North", "unification by prevailing over communism" with the 
backing of the U.S. imperialists, and its aggravation of 
tension under the pretext of the non- existent "nuclear problem" 
of the North was a premeditated provocation to pave the way for 
a war against the North. 
  But it must not act rashly. 
  The Kim Yong-sam traitor clique must clearly know that those 
who dare attempt to harm our socialist system centred on the 
masses will only suffer a miserable destruction.

<F P=106> ["Acts of Military Provocation in South Korea Will Not Be </F>
Tolerated, Warn Pyongyang Papers" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam ordered all the puppet Army forces on to "a stand-by 
alert", instructing the puppet Army bosses to round off the 
preparations for invading the North through the "cooperation 
system" with the United States, and the U.S. ambassador in Seoul 
and the U.S. Army commander present in South Korea, the puppet 
defence minister and the puppet foreign minister were closeted 
over "reexamination" of the war preparedness of the U.S. 
imperialist aggression forces and the puppet Army. Papers here 
today brand this as unpardonable acts of military provocation 
and premeditated kickup of military confrontation. 
  An analyst of NODONG SINMUN says: 
  The grave military step taken by the South Korean puppet 
clique at the instigation of the United States is a very grave 
provocation going beyond the limit of mere threat to us. 
  We can never tolerate and overlook the military racket of 
the South Korean puppets encouraged by outside forces. 
  The Korean people and People's Army do not want a war but 
are 
never afraid of it. 
  If the South Korean puppets dare ignite a war against us, 
our 
people and People's Army will answer it with a hundred-fold 
retaliation. 
  A MINJU CHOSON analyst declares that if the Kim Yong-sam 
group provoked a war against the North in league with outside 
forces, we would take a decisive self-defensive step to defend 
the socialist motherland and the dignity of the nation.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of 
Korea in a statement today bitterly denounced the Kim Yong-sam 
group's dangerous criminal acts to provoke a nuclear war in 
conspiracy with outside forces as a heinous treachery to plunge 
the Korean nation into a nuclear scourge. 
  The statement says: 
  "The South Korean authorities are heading for reckless 
confrontation with fellow countrymen, totally denying 
North-South dialogue. This is an extension of the anti-DPRK, 
anti-socialist campaign they have consistently waged with the 
imperialist reactionaries. 
  "No sooner had they brought the working-level contact for 
the 
exchange of presidential envoys to a rupture than they kicked up 
a big fuss as a servant of foreign forces in the anti-DPRK, 
anti-socialist campaign, by issuing a `special alert order' 
throughout South Korea, calling their master on the phone, 
sending a letter to him and making mendicant trips to do harm to 
fellow countrymen. 
  "The reality shows that with the flunkeyist traitor left 
within the nation, our fellow countrymen cannot live in peace 
nor can they think of the peace and peaceful reunification of 
the country and the nation will inevitably suffer a scourge of 
war. 
  "We regard it humiliating to have the traitor within the 
nation. We will never tolerate his treacheries. 
  "The traitor Kim Yong-sam must clearly know that he will 
never be able to escape the blame for the consequences of his 
dependence on outside forces and flunkeyism against fellow 
countrymen."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "National Traitors Should Be </F>
Removed"] 
  [Text] Because of the South Korean puppets' reckless war 
maneuvers, an extremely grave unpredictable situation is created 
on the Korean peninsula now. As has been reported, the Kim 
Yong-sam ring, in a so-called security related-ministers meeting 
held recently at Chongwadae [presidential residence], raved, 
placing blame on us, that it would resume the Team Spirit joint 
military exercise and that it would deploy Patriot missiles in 
South Korea soon. 
  Based on this provocative step, the puppet Army troops 
entered into an emergency alert posture, and Patriot missiles 
are being moved from the United States to South Korea. These 
extraordinary military moves are intentional acts aimed at 
further aggravating tensions on the Korean peninsula in order to 
lead the situation to an extreme phase of war. This is an 
unpardonable crime. 
  As everyone knows, we have been consistently asserting that 
all the pending issues, including the nuclear issue, be resolved 
through dialogue and negotiation. However, the Kim Yong-sam 
ring is not interested in national reconciliation and unity or 
the country's peace and reunification, but is only scheming to 
harm the fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces. 
Therefore, they intentionally broke down the working delegates' 
contact for the presidential special envoys of the North and the 
South, to which they had reluctantly responded, and are 
resorting to open war maneuvers. 
  If the Team Spirit joint military exercise is resumed and 
Patriot missiles deployed in South Korea, it is very clear what 
adverse effect it will bring to the situation on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  It is well known that traitor Kim Yong-sam, coming in power 
under the mask of a civilian regime, raved about supremacy of 
the nation over foreign forces and the improvement of relations 
with the North from the starting point of regarding it as the 
same nation. However, although he said that in words, in action 
he resumed the Team Spirit joint military exercise, which was 
suspended even during the Sixth Republic, last year, and is 
planning to enforce it this year as well. He is bringing even 
Patriot missiles, the deployment of which even his predecessor 
military hooligans did not dare, into South Korea, further 
aggravating tension. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring is an extremely vicious war fanatic 
far 
worse than his predecessor military dictators, and a national 
traitors ring of filthy flunkeyist nation-sellers and national 
treachery which try to find a way for survival by harming the 
fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces. By resuming 
the Team Spirit joint military exercise and bringing in Patriot 
missiles, they themselves revealed that they are warmongers 
under the guise of a civilian mask. 
  As long as the Kim Yong-sam traitorous group, which is more 
intimate with outside forces than with the fellow countrymen and 
seeks war and division rather than peace and reunification, 
remains is power, we cannot hope for peace and reunification of 
the country, nor can we avoid the catastrophe of a nuclear war 
falling on the nation. 
  It is the shame of our nation that there exists a ring of 
national treachery like the Kim Yong-sam ring in our country 
which boasts a 5,000-year history. The Kim Yong-sam traitorous 
clique, which deepens confrontation between fellow countrymen 
and brings fire clouds of war, should be removed as soon as 
possible. 
  If the Kim Yong-sam ring, a foolish ring which sustains its 
doomed life clinging to the lower end of the U.S. master's 
clothes, thinks it can harm someone by means of a war in 
collusion with outside forces, it is grossly miscalculating. 
  Our people and People's Army who are well prepared for 
either 
dialogue or war will never just remain still and look on. If 
they start a war despite our repeated warnings, we will 
resolutely punish them. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique should squarely see that the 
provocation of a war will be an act of suicide which brings a 
total destruction of the civilian regime and act with 
discretion, and stop immediately the very dangerous act of 
leading the situation to the phase of a war.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today 
brands Japan as a crime-filled country which has neither 
qualification nor face to become a permanent member of the 
United Nations Security Council. 
  The news analyst says: 
  Whenever an opportunity presents itself, high-ranking 
Japanese officials do not forget to vociferate about 
"international contributions" of Japan, revealing their 
intention to make Japan a permanent member of the UN Security 
Council. 
  The UN Security Council might be polluted with dirt if such 
a 
country as Japan with a history of abominable crimes becomes a 
permanent member of the security council. 
  Japan has jumped to the second topmost rung of the world's 
ladder in military expenditures and is proceeding with the 
modernisation of navy and air force of the "Self-Defense Forces" 
[SDF] and legalization of overseas military activities of the 
"SDF". 
  It must not be overlooked that the present Japanese 
authorities are trying to lay obstacles to a solution to the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula by crying over the 
"nuclear issue" of the North and make it a pretext for Japan's 
nuclear armament. 
  It is the height of sarcasm for Japan to attempt to become a 
permanent member of the UN Security Council the basic mission of 
which is to ensure world peace and security. 
  If Japan wants to win international confidence, it must 
clearly liquidate its past crimes and stop its moves to become a 
military power and arm itself with nuclear weapons.

<F P=106> ["Independence Against Imperialism Is Basic Idea of </F>

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- The Non-Aligned 
Movement (NAM) must exist and advance under the banner of 
independence against imperialism as long as the imperialist 
dominationist forces remain and the idea of NAM is yet to be 
realized, declares MINJU CHOSON in a by-lined article today. 
  The article says: 
  NAM is entering into a new phase and independence against 
imperialism remains its idea. 
  The imperialists and the reactionary forces averse to NAM's 
independent advancement against imperialism are trying by hook 
or by crook to keep off the influence of the movement and 
enervate it. The imperialists and some old forces, advertising 
international detente, contend that NAM has lost the 
effectiveness of its existence, and are setting afloat the claim 
that the basic idea must be revised and the orientation of its 
action be switched over to economic matters from political 
matters. 
  They are bringing all manner of political and economic 
pressure to bear upon the non-aligned countries adhering to the 
independent stand against imperialism, seeking to impede the 
cause of the independence of the people, and working to split 
nam by causing friction and estrangement among those countries. 
  Such being the situation, the non-aligned countries can not 
realize their desire to enjoy an independent life free from 
domination and subjugation, unless they enhance the function and 
role of NAM and strengthen the revolutionary struggle against 
imperialism. 
  Stressing the need for the non-aligned countries to actively 
strive to intensify this movement with firm conviction of the 
justice of it and its idea, the article continues: 
  What is of importance in intensifying NAM is to invariably 
maintain its basic idea and principle. NAM is, in essence, a 
movement for making the whole world democratic and independent 
and its basic principle is to maintain independence, not joining 
any bloc. 
  The idea and principle of NAM are its life and soul and an 
indispensable requisite that must be maintained in the whole 
course of its activities. 
  The non-aligned countries must not waver in any complicated 
situation, but remain faithful to the idea and principle of NAM 
and reject all attempts to detach it from its qnherdct idea and 
principle. Of importance in intensifying NAM at present is to 
achieve its unity and cohesion. 
  The non-aligned countries must closely unite on the 
principle 
of mutual respect and non-interference in other's internal 
affairs, equality and mutual benefit and check and foil the 
imperialists' moves of division and estrangement with a strategy 
of unity. 
  The non-aligned countries will accelerate the building of an 
independent new world and realize at any cost the noble idea of 
independence against imperialism by intensifying and developing 
NAM, firmly united under the banner of independence against 
imperialism.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- The achievement in the 
fulfilment of the Third Seven-Year Plan (1987-1993) in the DPRK 
is that the industrial output increased 50 percent and its 
annual average growth rate reached 5.6 percent. 
  It is thanks to the mighty independent national economy that 
the DPRK has developed the economy unaffected by the worldwide 
economic fluctuation under the situation in which the socialist 
market collapsed and anti-DPRK campaign by the imperialists and 
reactionaries has been intensified as never before. 
  Today Korea has many-sided and modern industry enough to 
produce by itself heavy and light industrial products needed for 
economic construction, defence upbuilding and people's living. 
  In the electric power industrial domain the Pukchang thermal 
power complex, the Taechon power stations and many other large 
hydro and thermal power plants and minor power stations have 
been built. As a result, the electric power output was 55,500 
million kwh in 1989 and that in late 1993 was 30 percent up on 
the 1986 figure. 
  In mining industry, large-scale coal mines in Anju, Sunchon 
and Pukchang and the Komdok general mining enterprise and other 
mines in Tanchon and Yanggang Province have been reconstructed 
on an expansion basis and a large number of new coal mines, ore 
mines and pits have been developed in those districts rich in 
deposit and favourable for mining. 
  The coal output has grown year by year and in 1993 it was 40 
percent up on the 1986 figure. 
  The output of nonferrous metal ores increased 60 percent in 
the period of the fulfilment of the third seven-year plan. 
  The production capacity of the Kim Chaek Iron and steel 
complex, the Chollima steel complex and other iron and steel 
works has expanded and new bases for producing various kinds of 
steel such as pressure pipes and stainless steel pipes have been 
built to considerably raise the steel output in the metal 
industry. 
  With the rapid development of machine building, electronic, 
and automation industries, a great advance has been made in 
introducing precision, large-size and high-speed equipment and 
the material and technical foundations of the electronic and 
automation industries have been further consolidated. 
  These sectors produced a 10,000-ton press, 125,000 kv-a 
[kilovolt-ampere] hydraulic generators, an extra-large-sized 
oxygen plant and NC [numerically controlled] machine tools and 
are now manufacturing complete sets of metal, chemical, 
building, electric and other equipment needed for different 
sectors of the national economy. 
  With the development of chemical industry, light industry, 
fisheries and agriculture the need for the people's living is 
being met with domestic products. 
  The Korean people have the mighty socialist independent 
national economy and abundant resources enough to live on their 
own efforts under any situation. 
  No political and ideological offensive, economic blockade 
and 
military threat of the imperialists and reactionaries can 
frighten the Korean people.

<F P=106> ["Text" of Announcement No. 19/TB-UB issued by Ho Chi Minh </F>
City People's Committee on 2 March: "Illegal Activities of 
Bishop Huynh Van Nghi in Ho Chi Minh City"] 
  [Text] The SRV Government already expressed its views to 
the Vatican about the latter's unilateral appointment of Bishop 
Huynh Van Nghi from Phan Thiet Diocese the Ho Chi Minh City 
Archbishop Office [HCMCAO] supervisor without consultation with 
the Vietnamese Government. The Ho Chi Minh City People's 
Committee [HCMCPC] also issued Announcement No. 100/TB-UB on 15 
September 1993 to clarify its views. 
  Regarding Bishop Huynh Van Nghi, the Ho Chi Minh City 
government's attitude has been respectful: 
  - On 25 August 1993, the Ho Chi Minh City Fatherland Front 
and the HCMCPC Religion Department directly informed Bishop 
Huynh Van Nghi that his appointment to the HCMCAO was at 
variance with the SRV law, therefore, it was not accepted. The 
Decree No. 69 issued by the Council of Ministers on 21 March 
1991 stipulates in its Article 19 that: "[The appointment of] 
clergymen such as Buddhist bonze superiors; Catholic cardinals, 
bishops, and supervising priests; and equivalent clergymen in 
other religions must be approved by the Council of Ministers". 
This regulation is also practiced by many countries in the 
world. 
  - On 5 September 1993, an HCMCPC authoritative official met 
and requested Bishop Huynh Van Nghi to stop all his activities 
as an HCMCAO supervisor. 
  However, Bishop Huynh Van Nghi has continued to select and 
appoint his general representative and representatives in charge 
of congregations and to set up the standing committee of the 
Ecclesiastical Regional Council,... at the same time, he has 
also presided many religious retreats, meetings,..., thus 
creating bad public opinion and affecting the public 
respectability to the law. 
  - On 28 September 1993, the HCMCPC Religion Department sent 
a 
letter to Bishop Huynh Van Nghi reminding him not to conduct any 
religious activities in Ho Chi Minh City pending an agreement 
between the SRV Government and the Vatican. 
  Regretfully, Bishop Huynh Van Nghi has not reciprocated the 
Ho Chi Minh City government's goodwill. 
  The HCMCPC had approved and created favorable conditions for 
the congregations to ordain 11 novices. But Bishop Huynh Van 
Nghi, on behalf of the HCMCAO, prevented the congregations' 
inviting other bishops to preside over the ordination in the 
city, causing difficulties for the congregations and relatives 
of the novices. Moreover, Bishop Huynh Van Nghi also sent 
letters to the supervising priests of related provinces, blaming 
the government. (the letter dated 5 October 1993 was copied and 
widely distributed among church followers). 
  For many months, Bishop Huynh Van Nghi continued to write 
and 
disseminate religious affairs letters and other documents on 
behalf of the HCMCAO. 
  The aforementioned activities by Bishop Huynh Van Nghi are 
violating the Decre No. 69 of the Council of Ministers, showing 
disrespect to the Ho Chi Minh City Government, and affecting the 
fine time-honoured relation between the government and the 
HCMCAO. 
  The law cannot be held in contempt. On 22 February, the Ho 
Chi Minh City government held a working session with Bishop 
Huynh Van Nghi to point out his violations. 
  In observance of the SRV Government's policy of freedom of 
religion, for more than 18 years, the HCMCPC has always created 
favorable conditions for the people to have an improved 
religious life-style and standard of living. The Catholic 
compatriots, due to the 1 May 1980 Open Letter of the Vietnam 
Bishop Council and the leadership of Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh, 
have actively contributed to the Ho Chi Minh City construction 
and protection and the building of the all-people unity and the 
unity between religious and nonreligious people. The government 
highly evaluates the patriotism of the Catholic compatriot who, 
together with other people in the city, has overcome 
difficulties and shared achievements and pride. 
  The HCMCPC is very much in sympathy with the earnest 
aspiration of the Catholic priests and followers to have 
somebody to lead this diocese for the continuation of the fine 
direction executed by Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh for many years 
and for religious prosperity and happiness. 
  On behalf of the HCMCPC, for the chairman, 
Signed: Vice Chairman Vo Viet Thanh

  [Text] The KINH DOANH VA PHAP LUAT (Business and Law) 
journal has recently reported that goods smuggling has been 
increasing since early this year. Concerned agencies recently 
detected two of out a group of eight foreign cargo ships 
carrying smuggled goods. 
  Drug trafficking has also been on the increase in recent 
days. In the first two months of this year, the authorities 
uncovered 17 cases of trafficking and confiscated 450 kg of 
opium and 0.72 kg of heroin. The most serious was the smuggling 
of 129 kg of opium by cadres of the Dien Bien goldsmith shop in 
Lai Chau Province. 
  It is noteworthy that the manufacturing and trading of fake 
goods done in meticulous ways are also widespread. Police 
nationwide have so far detected and dealt with 2,700 cases. 
This is a new challenge for responsible agencies in the 
struggle against smuggling.

  [Text] Seoul, March 25 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has put its 
Armed Forces on a state of alert, while checking its emergency 
communications network and increasing military drills, Defense 
Minister Yi Pyong-tae and Agency for National Security Planning

  They made the remarks in reporting on developments in North

In-hwan said after the meeting. 
  The Stalinist regime is fueling North Koreans' hostility 
toward the South by talking about the inevitability of war and 
threatening to pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
if the U.N. Security Council imposes sanctions and has suspended 
issuance of travel permits, O quoted Yi and Kim as saying. 
  O said the meeting heard reports on developments in the 
nuclear situation over the past several days, including 
movements by the North Korean Armed Forces.

  [Text] It has been learned that all of North Korea has 
entered a wartime system and an emergency order [pisangryong] 
was handed out to the whole Army. 
  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and Kim Tok, director of the 
Agency for National Security Planning, reported this to Prime 
Minister Yi Hoe-chang during a security-related ministers' 
meeting held at the prime minister's official residence on 25 
March. They revealed that North Korea has suspended issuing 
travel permission to its residents and is heightening an 
atmosphere of willingness for war [iljon pulsa punwigi]. 
  According to the report, the North Korean Army intensified 
military exercises and examined its emergency communications 
network. It has also increased construction of defense 
facilities, including installing barriers. Meanwhile, North 
Korean media, including radio broadcasts, claim that "a 
Southward war is inevitable." [taenam chonjaengi pulgapi hada] 
  According to this, Prime Minister Yi instructed relevant 
ministers that a crisis management system should be concretely 
worked out to cope with an emergency and this system should be 
thoroughly examined.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Yi Song-yul] </F>
  [Text] In the wake of North Korea's repeated expressions of 
willingness to go to a war, many South Koreans are worried about 
the catastrophe a war would bring about. 
  But they don't seem to be scared by the threat that "Seoul 
will be turned into a sea of flames if war breaks out," 
attributed to a North Korean delegate at an inter-Korea meeting 
last week at the truce village of Panmunjom. 
  They believe that if the North dares a preemptive attack 
against the South it will suffer quick destruction. 
  "Yes, that's right," said a military source who wanted to 
remain unnamed. "By the time they drop many bombs on Seoul, 
Pyongyang will be turned into a desert," he said, citing the 
very aggressive and retaliatory counterattack plan of South 
Korean and U.S. forces. 
  He was referring to Operation Plan 5027 of the South 
Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Command (CFC), or "Oplan 5027." 
Under the plan, also called "USFK 5027" and "CFC 5027," the 
combined defending forces of the two countries will occupy 
Pyongyang and Wonsan on the east coast of North Korea within two 
weeks of a North Korean invasion, neutralizing the Stalinist 
regime and thus unifying the Korean Peninsula. 
  "In case of a North Korean preemptive attack," said the 
source, "the combined defending forces will not give up Seoul or 
restrict themselves to repelling the enemy forces north of 
Seoul; they will advance to toppling the North Korean regime and 
thus regain the northern territory." 
  Such an aggressive counterattack plan had remained 
classified 
for years. But Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, in a testimony 
before the National Assembly, Wednesday confirmed the existence 
of such plans, saying that Seoul will make use of a North Korean 
invasion to fight national reunification. 
  "We have a strategic concept that in case North Koreans 
launch a preemptive attack we will use our retaliatory 
operations into an opportunity of national reunification," Yi 
said before the parliamentary Defense Committee. 
  Military experts said the operational concept of the CFC has 
changed from a defensive one, under which South Korean and U.S. 
forces were supposed to check the advance of invading forces 
north of Seoul, or along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Under an 
even earlier operational plan, the defending forces were to 
retreat to the south of Seoul, waiting for U.S. reinforcements 
before launching counterattacks. 
  "But under CFC 5027, a preemptive attack by the North would 
mean the collapse of the Stalinist regime and national 
unification," explained a military expert. 
  The CFC 5027 assumes a five-phase war scenario. In the first 
phase, the CFC, confirming signs of a North Korean attack, 
requests deployment of the U.S. flexible deterrence option 
(FDO), or quick deployed reinforcements, to the South. 
  Defcon III is invoked and the defending forces are on 
standby, awaiting further orders. 
  In the second phase, North Korean forces launch artillery 
attacks on the South Korean forces deployed along the DMZ, 
infiltrates special warfare troops into Seoul and other cities 
to harass the rear. Major roads are filled with South Korean 
refugees, serving as an obstacle for the CFC operations. 
  North Korean ground troops cross the border, and Scud and 
Nodong missiles hit Seoul and other major cities and military 
facilities in the South. CFC forces battle invading forces, 
hitting and devastating key military areas in the North. U.S. 
carrier battle groups join the attack against the rear of the 
North and Patriot missiles guard against Scud and Nodong 
missiles. The North Koreans are checked north of Seoul. 
  In the third phase the main forces of the North Korean 
troops 
are destroyed. The defending forces cross the DMZ and march 
northward, amid amphibious landing operations conducted on North 
Korean shores. CFC forces further advance to Chongchon River, 
north of Pyongyang. CFC has yet to decide whether to march 
further to the Yalu River that divides North Korea and China. 
  In the fourth phase, Pyongyang is occupied and CFC forces 
control local residents. 
  In the last phase, the Korean Peninsula is reunified under 
the leadership of South Korea. 
  In this aggressive operational plan, major damage and 
casualties on both sides are expected. But Defense Minister 
Yi's willingness to make use of a North Korean invasion as a 
chance for national unification is widely accepted as a timely 
manifestation of Seoul's confidence in its defense preparedness. 
It's also a strong warning to the North not to run the risk. 
  But nevertheless, a problem lies in the possibility that the 
North Korean regime may knowingly run the risk, not because it 
thinks it can communize the South by force, but as a means of 
solving chronic and explosive internal problems, such as the 
failing economy.

  [Text] Seoul, March 25 (YONHAP) -- The U.N. Security 
Council is expected to adopt a resolution on the North Korean 
nuclear situation around the end of this month, a Foreign 
Ministry official said Friday. 
  "The five permanent members of the council are in the middle 
of actively exchanging opinions on the content and strength of 
the resolution right now. They're almost finished and the 
resolution is likely to be decided soon," the official said. 
  The content is said to be rather weak so that China will not 
exercise its veto power, the official said. 
  The key point in the resolution is the International Atomic 
Energy Agency's additional demand to inspect two sites inside 
North Korea's radiochemical laboratory, believed to be a nuclear 
reprocessing facility, that were sealed off from earlier 
monitoring. 
  "The general feeling is that adoption of the resolution 
should not be too late," he said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 25 (YONHAP) -- South Korea opted to 
deal with the North Korean nuclear issue at the United Nations 
Friday, saying "thanks but no thanks" to a Russian proposal for 
an eight-party conference. 
  "Russia's proposal for an eight-party conference is part of 
the efforts to solve the North Korean nuclear problem through 
dialogue. We note the intentions behind it," a Foreign Ministry 
official said in a commentary. 
  "In solving the North Korean nuclear problem, efforts at the 
U.N. Security Council are important at this moment. The issue 
of an eight-party conference requires careful consideration by 
the United States, Japan and other involved nations," he said. 
  Russia's proposal invites participation by South and North 
Korea, the United States, Japan, China and Russia along with the 
United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  Seoul's reaction apparently reflects its reluctance to place 
Korean issues on the international table, although it seeks 
global coordination on the nuclear dispute. It has also chosen 
to rely on the South Korean-U.S. alliance at the moment instead 
of a multilateral arrangement. 
  Ministry officials said they were notified in advance of 
Moscow's proposal on Thursday afternoon. 
  Meanwhile, the officials welcomed Moscow's commitment to 
support the Security Council resolution on North Korea.

  [Text] Washington, March 25 (YONHAP) -- U.S. Assistant 
Secretary of State Winston Lord said Thursday that Washington 
was surprised at Seoul's reaction to a speech by an American 
official who advocated repeal of the National Security Law. 
  At a hearing of the East Asian and Pacific Affairs 
Subcommittee under the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Lord 
said, "Frankly, we were surprised at the reaction. We are sorry 
about it. We think it was exaggerated beyond its significance." 
  U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Asian and 
Pacific Affairs Thomas Hubbard made a speech at American 
University on Feb. 25 in which he stated that the United States 
advocated the repeal of South Korea's National Security Law, 
which prohibits any unauthorized contact with North Korea and 
any public statements or acts sympathetic to the North Korean 
regime. 
  The remarks came under immediate fire as unwelcome 
interference in Seoul's internal affairs. Hubbard drew even 
more criticism because he was chief U.S. working-level delegate 
to nuclear negotiations with North Korea. 
  Lord said, "Mr. Hubbard's speech at the time was 
overwhelmingly pointing to the good relations with South Korea, 
the positive steps they have been taking, including in democracy 
and human rights. And he in the course of that stated we 
believe that it would be better if the National Security Law 
were repealed. 
  "He had no desire to interfere in South Korea's domestic 
affairs. He is a very good friend of South Korea and he 
believes, as we all do, they have made tremendous progress, and 
it's symbolized by President Kim, a 30-year dissident, being 
president." 
  Lord said he did not want to exaggerate the issue's 
importance again. 
  "I really would like to make the point that the South 
Koreans 
should be praised for their advances toward democracy and human 
rights. And this should not obscure that." 
  He added, "I do note that I believe that since the speech, 
the South Koreans are now considering repealing the provision."

<F P=106> [By correspondent Yi To-un from Vladivostok] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned that 180 North Korean workers, 
who escaped from North Korean logging sites in Russia, have 
asked for political asylum in ROK missions, including the ROK 
Embassy in Moscow. Following this, about 40 North Korean workers 
asked for political asylum from the Russian Government. 
  Of these 40 North Korean loggers, four were officially 
granted political asylum by the Russian authorities, and many 
others were unofficially granted residence permission. 
  A relevant official in Vladivostok said on 23 March: About 
40 North Korean workers asked for political asylum from the 
Moscow authorities through human rights committees, lawyers 
associations in Russia, and the Russian Ministries of Justice 
and Foreign Affairs. With the help of lawyers and Korean 
residents in Russia, they claimed political and economic 
hardship, pointing out the situation of human rights being 
infringed upon at the logging sites, and asked for political 
asylum. 
  The official revealed that "the North Korean loggers, who 
were granted residence permission after asking for political 
asylum from the Russian authorities, are four in total, 
including a certain Kim and a certain Yun whose permission was 
granted in November 1992, and two other Kims, who were granted 
permission early this year. 
  He added that "many North Korean workers were granted 
residence permission unofficially, in addition to the number of 
those officially announced by the Russian authorities." 
  Since the situation of human rights being infringed upon at 
the North Korean logging sites has become an international 
issue, the Russian Government took it as a policy to grant 
political asylum to the loggers if there is no specific reason 
for rejection. However, since so many workers asked for asylum 
recently, the Russian authorities are temporarily withholding 
granting it. 
  On the other hand, the North Korean side claimed that those 
who asked for political asylum are all criminals, and strongly 
demanded that the Russian Government not grant them asylum. 
<H5>  This Issue Will Be Discussed Soon. </H5>
  Concerning the situation in which a large number of workers 
who escaped from the North Korean logging sites in Russia asked 
for political asylum from the Russian authorities, the ROK 
Foreign Ministry revealed that "it is aware of such reports but 
failed to receive any concrete reports as to how many cases 
there were." The ministry added that it will discuss the issue 
of dealing with them with the Prime Minister's office, the 
National Unification Board, the Agency for National Security 
Planning, and other relevant organizations.

  [Text] Seoul, march 25 (YONHAP) -- Security-related 
ministers met at the prime minister's residence at Samchong-tong 
Friday to review the country's security conditions at a time 
when President Kim Yong-sam is out of the country making 
official visits to Japan and China. 
  Prime minister Yi Hoe-chang asked those present at the 
meeting to be more vigilant against the dogmatic adventurism of 
North Korea. 
  "You should be prepared against any eventuality as the North 
Korean nuclear question is about to come away from the stage of 
dialogue into the phase of sanction by the UN Security Council," 
Yi said. 
  The prime minister also suggested that relevant offices let 
the people fully know about the government's policies toward 
North Korea since he said the people's understanding is 
important in building up the nation's overall security 
preparedness. 
  The officials present at the meeting included, besides the 
premier, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae, Information Minister O In-hwan, NSP Director Kim Tok 
and Chief Presidential Secretary Pak Kwan-yong.

  [Text] Seoul, March 25 (YONHAP) -- A Taegu man under 
suspicion of having worked for North Korea abroad, was turned 
over to the Seoul prosecution by the Agency for National 
Security Planning (NSP) on Friday. 
  An NSP investigation showed that Yi Pok-hon, age 33, of 
Sinam 
1-tong, Taegu, left the country in 1990 and had joined an 
international criminal ring, "AS," in Southeast Asia as a 
mid-boss. 
  It said that Yi, while working at the "AS," was recruited by 
North Korean agents, an NSP official said. 
  "The mission the North Koreans gave to Yi was to kill 
anti-Pyongyang Koreans abroad and win over South Korean gang 
leaders," he said. 
  Yi is alleged to have visited North Korea six times from 
1992 
through November 1993 to receive instructions and give reports 
on his espionage activities. 
  In one of his activities for North Korea, Yi provided North 
Korea with 100kg of heroin he obtained through the "AS" 
organization in June 1992, which North Korea smuggled to and 
sold at about 30 million U.S. dollars in Europe, the official 
said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 25 (YONHAP) -- South Korea will impose 
import fees on rice and 91 other farm products and specific 
duties on soybeans and 62 additional agricultural items under a 
revised country schedule on opening its farm market necessitated 
by the Uruguay Round accord. 
  Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Kim Yang-pae 
told the press Thursday the government had revised its farm 
market opening schedule submitted to the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on March 11 through bilateral 
negotiations with the United States, the European Union and 
Australia, which pressed for revisions. 
  The revised schedule is to be sent to the GATT Secretariat 
on 
Friday, he said. 
  Under the revised schedule, rice imports will be 51,307 tons 
a year, the level first set by the government. The U.S. 
Government retracted its demand for 56,000 tons. 
  The new schedule calls for exclusion of 26 items, including 
pork, chicken and raw silk, from the 118 items subject to import 
fees under the March 11 schedule. 
  Tariff rates on 385 items, 29.3 percent of the 1,312 items 
for import liberalization under the schedule, will be lowered 
and an ad valorem duty, charged as a percentage of the value of 
an item, will be applied on 1,249 items. The number of items 
upon which an ad valorem duty or a specific duty can be 
selectively applied decreased from 97 under the March 11 
schedule to 63 under the revised one. 
  In addition, tariff rates on 354 items will be lowered to 
the 
levels set under the first schedule submitted in April 1992 at 
the request of the United States and other countries. 
  Potato powder imports will be increased from 10 tons to 60 
tons a year, while the duty on ice cream powder will be lowered 
from 60 percent to 40 percent.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, March 25 (AFP) -- Cambodian King Norodom 
Sihanouk is "worried" about his government's offensive against 
the Khmer Rouge stronghold at Pailin and wants to see dialogue 
re- established between the two sides, his foreign minister said 
Friday. 
  Prince Norodom Sirivut, speaking after his return from 
Beijing, where he visited the king, said Sihanouk was "in fine 
form" as he recovered from prostate cancer surgery in the 
Chinese capital. 
  King Sihanouk is "in good health," said Prince Sirivut. 
Government sources said the king has seen his cancer reduced 
"95.5 percent." 
  As for the Khmer Rouge, the prince said "We should not close 
(?the door) on them. We have to give them the chance to return 
to the international community" and Cambodia should avoid 
"putting their backs to the wall," the prince said. 
  "We have tried the policy of the carrot, of the open door 
and 
then that of the stick, but now we have to allow the Khmer Rouge 
the opportunity to come forward to talk," he added, describing 
his discussions with the king. 
  He said Sihanouk was "a little worried" about the government 
offensive launched on the Khmer Rouge base at Pailin, in 
northwest Cambodia, earlier this month, and particularly about 
the ability of Phnom Penh to keep control of the area. 
  "His concern is justified, and I therefore have messages" 
for 
co- Prime-Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh "about His Majesty's 
thoughts on Pailin," Sirivut added. 
  He said China, an ally of the Khmer Rouge from 1970 until 
the 
Paris peace accord of 1991, "thinks it is not at all appropriate 
to involve itself in a little war" against the rebel movement. 
  The dialogue between Cambodia's government and the Khmer 
Rouges has all but broken down, as the guerrillas refuse to lay 
down their arms and allow access to territory under their 
control as called for under the peace pact. 
  The offensive on Pailin follows last month's battle for 
another major guerrilla stronghold, the northern town of Anlung 
Veng, in which the government suffered a major defeat. 
  King Sihanouk is expected to return to Phnom Penh on April 8 
after visiting his long-standing friend, North Korean leader Kim 
Il-song in Pyongyang, where he arrives on April 4 to celebrate 
Kim's birthday. 
  Sirivut added that the king had reiterated his support for 
Cambodian Finance Minister Sam Rangsi, who also visited the 
monarch in Beijing. 
  Rangsi's clean-up of the economy and the friction it caused, 
particularly with Thai investors, resulted in rumours that he 
may lose his post.

<F P=106> [Station commentary: "Why Do the Communist Vietnamese Force </F>
Their Puppets and Lackeys To Bark Repeatedly about the Pailin 
Battlefield and Why Does the Alliance Tremblingly Echo the 
Shouts?"] 
  [Text] Since they sent their lackey puppets' troops to 
carry out military operations in the Pailin region on 28 
February, the communist Vietnamese and Western alliance have 
ordered the puppets to bark repeatedly about the Pailin 
battlefield. As for their propaganda machines, including AFP 
and the French, Australian, and American radios, they have 
relayed the shouts in a shameless manner, showing their face as 
the undeniable propaganda apparatus of imperialists. While they 
barked that they had captured this or that village, they said 
that they had already postponed their military operations. 
Later, they claimed that they were continuing their offensives 
and that they were this or that far from Pailin. 
  The general public asks: In the circumstances where the king 
father calls for an end to the war and the entire Cambodian 
nation and people abhor the battle, why do the communist 
Vietnamese continue to force their lackey Khieu Kanharit to bark 
repeatedly about the attack on the Pailin battlefield, and why 
do the alliance's propaganda machines tremblingly echo, in 
earnest, the shouts in complete contradiction of the truth? 
Because: 
  1. The communist Vietnamese and the alliance as well as 
their lackey puppets within the two-headed government need to 
bark sharply and (?lie) profusely in accordance with the tactics 
[word indistinct] employed in the time of Hitler to conceal 
their most shameful and utter defeat on the Anlung Veng 
battlefield. 
  2. They need to bark to prevent their troops from becoming 
further demoralized and to motivate them to further invade this 
or that area in line with their plan and policy to continue the 
Vietnamese war of aggression. 
  3. They need to bark to threaten the masses and people in 
Phnom Penh and provinces not to rise up against them with regard 
to the problems of land, Vietnamese nationals, wages, and 
corruption. 
  All in all, their actions are a psychological war to fool 
their troops on the Pailin battlefield into going to war and to 
prevent the latter from breaking loose and ceasing to fight. 
Apparently, the communist Vietnamese puppets and two-headed 
government have continued to live on by waging war. They need 
to launch the onslaughts on the Anlung Veng and Pailin 
battlefields to collect money from foreign warmongers who want 
Cambodians to get killed further. This is why they have 
painstakingly muffled such barks. 
  In Phnom Penh, nobody can be trusted. The communist 
Vietnamese deceive the alliance; the alliance deceives the 
Vietnamese lackey puppets; and the Vietnamese lackey puppets 
deceive the two-headed government and glibly lie to the 
communist Vietnamese and the alliance. It is not known who 
deceives who and who lies to whom. So what is the truth behind 
this? 
  It is that the invading forces of the communist Vietnamese 
puppets and two-headed government are being surrounded by the 
people and National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK], which 
have constantly attacked them everywhere, such as in the 
Battambang provincial town, Kamping Puoy, Thnoeng, Sdau, Treng, 
and along Route 10. As of 18 March, nine of their T-54 tanks 
have been blown up, and more than 300 of their troops have been 
killed and 400 others wounded. Apart from this, they have been 
afflicted with malaria, typhoid, and diarrhea, and many of them 
have died while many hundred others have been shipped to the 
rear. The event at the Anlung Veng battlefield is clear 
evidence. 
  Moreover, the puppets and two-headed government, especially 
the communist Vietnamese, have already been aware that in 1985 
and 1990, tens of thousands of troops from the genuine 
Vietnamese 330th, 309th, and 4th divisions and the puppet 4th 
and 196th divisions backed by nearly 100 tanks, multiple rocket 
launchers, and cannons could do nothing to Pailin. Now, with 
the untidy soldiers, illegitimate officers and generals, and Pol 
Sareoun always staying in an armored carrier, can they live 
long? This can be seen in broad daylight. Nevertheless, they 
need to launch such offensives only to save themselves from 
peril now and then.

  [Text] Battambang, Cambodia, March 24 (AFP) -- Government 
forces were hacking a path to Pailin Thursday to bring up fresh 
troops and supplies to ensure they could hold the former rebel 
base "forever," a senior general said Thursday. 
  General Pol Saroeun, Phnom Penh's deputy chief of general 
staff, said Khmer Rouge guerrillas were staging attacks 
elsewhere to try to draw government forces out of Pailin. 
  "But we are not so stupid to do that. We have to maintain 
Pailin forever," he said. 
  To hold the former rebel headquarters in northwest Cambodia, 
he said, 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the old main road into 
Pailin had to be cleared of the jungle overgrowth and mines 
which had left it impassable for years. 
  "Soldiers have already started to clear the road from 
Chireang to Pailin and the work should be finished within a 
week," the general told AFP. 
  Pol Saroeun said access to Pailin via the stretch of former 
National Route 10 through what had been Khmer Rouge-held 
territory was essential so that fresh troops, supplies and heavy 
weaponry could be sent in to secure the town. 
  The access would also help thwart any Khmer Rouge 
counter-attacks, he said. 
  Government reinforcements, supplies and weaponry are now 
taken in by truck over a muddy jungle track which snakes around 
hills and mountains for some 30 kilometers (20 miles) in a 
journey that can take up to three days. 
  The general admitted the unusually heavy rains in the past 
few days were creating difficulties for government forces. 
  Two soldiers were killed and one wounded when a tank they 
were travelling on hit an anti-tank mine Tuesday as [words 
indistinct] to bypass the bogged-down traffic on the road.

additional results in the total capture of Pailin area; dated 24 
March -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] After totally capturing Pailin area on 19 March, 
the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] swept up those who 
obstinately refused to lay down their weapons and return to 
national society. 
  While launching the sweep operation in Pailin City, the KRAF 
made an appeal and gave an assurance in line with the national 
reconciliation policy of the Royal Government of the Kingdom of 
Cambodia, which stresses: 
  1. The Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] still recognizes 
all compatriots as Cambodian citizens like all innocent 
Cambodians in general who are currently living with the RGC. 
The RGC always cares about the fate of all compatriots. 
  2. The RGC guarantees its recognition of the ownership of 
land, houses, and all other property that the compatriots 
possess currently in line with the provisions of the existing 
laws of the Kingdom of Cambodia. 
  But, the obstinate Khmer Rouge ringleaders did not heed this 
appeal. They instead launched attacks against the KRAF. In the 
combat for self-defense, the KRAF killed 35 hardheaded Khmer 
Rouge elements on the spot; seized a tank, 453 assorted guns, 70 
metric tons of assorted ammunition, dozens of tons of war 
materiel, two bulldozers, a Toyota car, a 751-A cistern, (?a 
jeep), and 80-meter radio antenna. 
  [Signed] General Pan Thai for the KRAF General Staff 
  Issued on 24 March 1994

  [Text] President Kim Yong-sam, meeting with ROK 
correspondents in Tokyo this morning, said that the remark made 
by the North Korean delegate at the inter-Korean working contact 
held last week threatening that North Korea is ready for war was 
premeditated and that he regards it as the remark of the highest 
person in authority in North Korea. 
  President Kim Yong-sam said that he thinks China basically 
does not want North Korea to develop nuclear weapons since China 
does not want to be isolated as a member of international 
community. President Kim said that he will be able to have frank 
exchange of views with Chinese President Jiang Zemin through 
summit talks with him on the measures to cope with the critical 
North Korean nuclear issue.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam indicated Friday he does not think China would use its 
veto power if the UN Security Council seeks to impose sanctions 
on North Korea over the prolonged nuclear inspections issue. 
  Kim told a breakfast meeting with Korean journalists 
stationed in Japan that China, in principle, does not want to 
see a nuclear-armed North Korea but it also does not want to 
choose a path that would isolate North Korea from international 
society. 
  Pyongyang's refusal to permit complete inspections of its 
nuclear facilities, suspected of being used in a secret nuclear 
weapons development program, was referred to the Security 
Council by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) earlier 
this week. 
  Beijing, Pyongyang's lone major ally, has repeatedly said it 
opposes trade and economic sanctions against North Korea. 
  Security Council members, however, are reportedly drawing up 
a resolution without sanctions that calls upon Pyongyang to 
accept complete IAEA inspections but analysts have suggested 
that the next step would be a resolution calling for sanctions. 
  Kim is currently in Tokyo meeting Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and will travel to China on Saturday calling for 
support in demanding North Korea be transparent with its nuclear 
program.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam urged North Korea on Friday to accept unimpeded 
inspection of its nuclear facilities to prevent an outbreak of a 
"nuclear holocaust." 
  "We must thus prepare a solid blueprint for peace. We must 
strive to establish a world free from the fear of war and 
nuclear holocaust. In this context, North Korea's lack of 
nuclear transparency is an ever more urgent issue," Kim told a 
lecture meeting at Japan's prestigious Waseda University. 
  His remarks came one day after Hans Blix, director general 
of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported to a 
meeting of the U.N. Security Council that North Korea broke its 
vow to allow IAEA inspectors full access to nuclear facilities. 
  Kim, dressed in a purple and black academic gown given to 
him 
by Waseda officials, issued the appeal in front of some 1,000 
Japanese and South Korean students, academics and journalists 
who packed the university's Okuma auditorium. 
  Minutes before, Kim was awarded the university's honorary 
doctorate. Some 400 South Korean students are studying at the 
university out of a total student population of 46,000. 
  During the president's speech, about 200 ultraleftist 
radicals demonstrated outside the hall, demanding the 
cancellation of the South Korean Government's plan to deploy a 
Patriot antimissile system to counter North Korean ballistic 
missiles. 
  The president, now on a three-day official visit to Japan, 
denounced the Pyongyang government for defying the IAEA's 
demands for full inspection of its nuclear facilities in 
Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang. 
  "It is depressing that North Korea continues to disregard 
the 
global demand for its nuclear transparency, casting a dark cloud 
over the Korean peninsula and the future of the Asia-Pacific 
region," the president said. 
  In his speech entitled, "A Blueprint for a New Asia and a 
New 
World," he said, "During this past century of Western inroads 
into the East, Asia was thrown into a state of shock and 
confusion. From that point on, Asia has been anxious to catch 
up to Western civilization." 
  "Now however, the world's center stage is shifting to the 
Pacific and East Asia is becoming the focus of world attention. 
Asians should now reflect on themselves and see Asia in a new 
light. We Asians must join hands to build a new Asia and a new 
world as well," he said. 
  "Our two peoples should discard past prejudices for good and 
accept each other with open hearts and minds. We should 
honestly recognize the truths of history and have the courage to 
accept their lessons. A nation that fails to learn these 
lessons is bound to repeat past mistakes. We should join hands 
to shape a fulfilling future based on mutual trust." 
  "To that end, young people of both countries, who are not 
steeped in old attitudes, must take the lead. If our young 
people march onward hand in hand, the future of the Asia-Pacific 
region will be ever more peaceful and fruitful. Our future 
hinges on their resolve and deeds," the president said. 
  In the afternoon, Kim delivered a speech at Tokyo's Waseda 
University, where he elaborated on his vision of a "blueprint 
for a new Asia and a new world." 
  Kim urged North Korea to accept unimpeded inspection of its 
nuclear facilities to prevent an outbreak of a "nuclear 
holocaust." 
  "We must strive to establish a world free from the fear of 
war and nuclear holocaust," Kim told a lecture meeting at 
Japan's prestigious Waseda university. "In this context, North 
Korea's lack of nuclear transparency is an ever more urgent 
issue. 
  "It is depressing that North Korea continues to disregard

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- The following is the 
official translation of the prepared text of South Korean 
President Kim Yong-sam's address to a joint session of the 
Japanese parliament Friday. 
  (Toward a new era of friendship and cooperation) 
  The honorable Takako Doi, speaker of the House of 
Representatives, the honorable Bunbei Hara, president of the 
House of Councilors, distinguished members of both houses of the 
Diet, 
  Today, I have the honor of standing on the podium of the 
Diet, a major symbol of Japanese democracy. I am especially 
moved by this because I have been a firm believer in 
parliamentary democracy all my life. 
  First, I would like to take this opportunity to convey warm 
and friendly greetings from the Korean people to the people of 
Japan. I am grateful to you for having arranged this 
significant occasion for me. And I salute you for pressing 
ahead with political reforms in your country. 
  Distinguished members of the Diet, 
  It was 100 years ago, in 1894, that Japan and China fought 
against each other on the Korean peninsula. Having won this 
Sino-Japanese war, Japan eventually crushed Korea under its 
feet. Though Korea was liberated in 1945, it was quickly 
divided into the South and the North and subsequently suffered a 
horrible fratricidal war. Korea still bears the national pain of 
being the only and last divided land on earth. As such, 
Korea-Japan relations for the past 100 years have tended to be 
marked more by strife and friction than by goodwill and 
cooperation. 
  On behalf of the people of the Republic of Korea, I hereby 
propose to you and the Japanese people that we close this 
century of strife and friction and open a new era of genuine 
bilateral friendship and cooperation. 
  In recent times, the Japanese people have achieved 
glistening 
national development. I believe the spirit of hard work and the 
unity of the Japanese people have combined with outstanding 
government and business leadership to make Japan as it is today. 
  Japanese citizens from all walks of life greatly encouraged 
and supported me during the difficult times of my struggles for 
democracy. The steady advancement of Japanese democracy 
inspired me with the confidence that democracy could thrive in 
the Republic of Korea also, and I was able to refute the 
allegations that Asian soil was not fit for democracy to take 
root. I came also to be convinced that rapid growth could be 
achieved under democracy. It is my belief that increasingly 
close ties have been developing between the Republic of Korea 
and Japan on the strength of our shared ideals not only of 
market economics but of democracy as well. 
  Over the past year, the Republic of Korea has pursued 
drastic 
change and reform in all aspects of national life. In 
particular, our determination to carry out political reforms and 
root out misconduct and corruption has never wavered. The 
enforcement of the law requiring public officials to register 
and disclose their assets has eliminated room for corruption 
among government officials and politicians. The real-name 
financial transaction system has severed collusive links between 
politics and business. Political reform bills have become law, 
fundamentally transforming electoral practices and political 
behavior. 
  Korean democracy has thus come of age. Political reforms 
in both Korea and Japan are sparking reforms throughout Asia. 
Prime Minister Hosokawa and I have congratulated each other on 
the successful pursuit of reforms in each other's country. This 
is fostering a fine tradition of amity between the leaders of 
Korea and Japan. I would like to take this occasion to pay 
tribute to you once more for having embarked on an avenue to 
reforms in response to a call of the times. 
  Distinguished members of the Diet, citizens of Japan, 
  The world is now changing ever more rapidly. It is moving 
away from an age of distrust and confrontation and into an era 
of reconciliation and cooperation. Our planet is shrinking into 
one global village. National borders are being lowered, and 
global and regional cooperation is gaining force. 
  The prediction of Toynbee that 21st century would be a 
Pacific century is coming true. Koreans and Japanese should now 
share new dreams -- dreams of a new Korea-Japan relationship, of 
a new Asia-Pacific region, of a new world. We should share a 
lofty and grand vision encompassing the spacious Pacific that 
can strike a responsive chord in the minds of two billion 
Asians. We must work together with a new attitude in order to 
realize such dreams. 
  Saneatsu Mushanokoji, a noted Japanese novelist, painted a 
tomato and an eggplant on a large white dish and wrote on it: "I 
am I, you are you, but we should get along." But we should move 
beyond the implications of this beautiful work of art. Now is 
the time to build a larger regional community with a spirit of 
coexistence and shared prosperity, even while maintaining our 
own identities and diversity. In this way, we should be able to 
March into an Asia-Pacific age of peace and prosperity. 
  Distinguished members of the Diet, 
  Now, the peoples of Korea and Japan must open their hearts 
and minds to each other. We must put the past completely behind 
us. The Korean people are willing to look ahead and build a 
brighter future. To help forge a new Korea-Japan relationship 
crucial to ushering in a new Asia-Pacific age, the Japanese 
people should also muster the courage to squarely face the 
truths of history and live up to their lessons. We must not 
allow emotional residue or ethnic prejudices to remain unabated 
and obstruct the development of a mature bilateral partnership. 
  In this context, I believe it is very important to promote 
goodwill and amity between the Korean residents in Japan and 
Japanese citizens. We have a saying in Korea which goes, "your 
neighbors are your cousins." Korea and Japan have long been 
"cousins." Should such close neighbors fail to build genuine 
mutual trust, it would be difficult for them to win the trust of 
others. 
  Our two countries must now forge new ties of cooperation 
with 
new attitudes and new visions. The imperatives of the post-Cold 
War international situation urgently call for such a cooperative 
relationship. In particular, complementary bilateral economic 
cooperation is a mandate of the new times. We must endeavor to 
build ties of economic cooperation according to economic, rather 
than political, logic. 
  Distinguished members of the Diet, 
  Our two nations should work closely together to remove 
impediments to the peace and prosperity of this region with a 
new spirit of mutual trust and cooperation. In this regard, I 
take this occasion to thank your country for cooperating with us 
in the efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. The 
Republic of Korea firmly adheres to the position that the terms 
of the South-North Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of 
the Korean Peninsula must be implemented without fail. We have 
thus been patiently endeavoring to peacefully resolve the North 
Korean nuclear issue through dialogue. Recently, however, North 
Korea has dishonored its international commitments: It has not 
only failed to properly deal with IAEA inspections but has also 
unilaterally broken off South-North dialogue. It is most 
regrettable that in that way the North has exacerbated 
suspicions about its nuclear intentions. 
  Both the Korean and Japanese peoples have acutely 
experienced 
the horrors of war. Japan is the first and only country ever to 
suffer a nuclear attack. Korea is the first country to undergo 
a fratricidal ideological war. Spurred on by this shared bitter 
experience, we must strive together to take the lead in building 
lasting peace throughout this region. We must cooperate even 
more closely to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction and bring under control arms races in the 
Asia-Pacific region. The time has come to initiate multilateral 
cooperation to ease tension and promote the common security of 
this region. 
  Korea and Japan should also more closely pull together to 
induce openness and reform in North Korea and to promote the 
cause of peaceful unification of South and North Korea. Korean 
unification would greatly contribute not only to easing regional 
tension but also to boosting regional exchange and cooperation. 
This would serve to develop northeast Asia into the hub of 
prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  My view is that such developments would certainly be in 
the national interest of Japan as well. I am certain that a 
unified Korea would be a trustworthy partner for Japan. I hope 
the people and Government of Japan will even more actively 
support Korean unification. 
  Last but not least, I want to emphasize that our two 
countries must work closely together to promote coexistence 
among and the shared prosperity of all countries in the 
Asia-Pacific region. My view is that the future of the 
Asia-Pacific will be largely swayed by the triangular 
cooperative ties among Korea, the United States and Japan as 
well as cooperation among all Asian nations. The triad of 
Korea, the U.S. and Japan is the key to the coexistence among 
and shared prosperity of Asian nations and is central to the 
development of a Pacific community. 
  By furthering these ties of cooperation, our two countries 
should be able to advance the peace and prosperity of Asia as a 
whole. Moreover, such efforts would lead to an early 
materialization of an Asia-Pacific community. The Republic of 
Korea is willing to join forces with Japan and China in playing 
responsible roles to that end. 
  The world is keenly watching Japan's efforts to sharply 
change its course: Changes in Japan are bound to have a major 
impact not only on Asia but also on the world at large. 
  As long as each and every member of the international 
community remains obsessed solely with its own prosperity, we 
will hardly be able to develop the whole world on a genuinely 
communal basis. Without a balanced development of this region, 
we can hardly expect genuine regional peace. To this end, we 
must also redress any excessive and persistent imbalance in 
economic relations between nations. 
  Korea, Japan and China must join forces to play a joint 
central role to create a new Asia that will be able to 
contribute ever more greatly to the betterment of mankind. In 
the past century, the Pacific was often battered by political 
typhoons and quakes. Anticipating a Pacific age in the early 
21st century, Korea and Japan should take joint responsibility 
for leading the effort to turn the Pacific into an ocean of 
peace and prosperity. 
  To that end, it is imperative first to make the strait that 
divides our two countries into a sea of friendship and 
cooperation. I believe that before long, Koreans and Japanese 
will be able to travel to each others' countries as if they were 
traveling around their own lands. I believe that Tokyo, Seoul 
and Beijing will become truly next-door neighbors in the near 
future. Let us dash together toward that goal. 
  I hope from the bottom of my heart that my speech today will 
be a new landmark in our progress toward a genuine Korea-Japan 
partnership. 
  Thank you.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam said Friday [25 March] a nuclear-free peace will come 
true in East Asia with joint efforts and cooperation by South 
Korea and Japan. Kim referred to North Korea's suspected 
nuclear weapons program in a banquet hosted by Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  "(North Korea) has threatened peace in this region. But 
cooperation between South Korea and Japan will surely bring a 
nuclear-free peace to (the region)," he said. 
  The South Korean president, who arrived in Tokyo on Thursday 
for a three-day visit, said he expects both countries will 
overcome a transitional period through close cooperation and 
mutual trust. 
  Prior to the speech by Kim, Hosokawa said that the 
building-up of relations of trust between Japan and South Korea 
will begin with addressing the past frankly. 
  Hosokawa touched on Japan's colonial rule of the Korean 
peninsula from 1910 to 1945, saying, "studying the lessons of 
the history from now on is a way of strengthening partnership 
(between Seoul and Tokyo.)" 
  He said it is important for Japan and South Korea to 
cooperate on every field to develop and stabilize relations 
between the two nations. 
  Hosokawa said such cooperation will convince Japan and South 
Korea that they are irreplaceable partners in an international 
society. 
  Among those who attended the banquet were former Prime 
Minister Noboru Takeshita, former Foreign Minister Michio 
Watanabe and Liberal Democratic Party President Yohei Kono.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- The leader of the biggest 
party in Japan's seven-party coalition urged Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa on Friday [25 March] not to go along with a 
multilateral move to slap economic sanctions on North Korea. 
  Social Democratic Party Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said he 
pushed the request in a meeting Friday with Hosokawa at the 
premier's official residence. "I told the premier that even the 
U.N. Security Council would not be able to reach an agreement 
(to impose the sanctions) easily," he told reporters as he 
stepped out of the room where he held talks with Hosokawa. 
  "I asked the premier to respond cautiously regarding the 
North Korean matter," Murayama said. He quoted Hosokawa as 
replying to him on the spot, "it may be so." 
  The premier's remark came one day after he told South Korean 
President Kim Yong-sam, "if the U.N. Security Council adopted a 
resolution (to impose economic sanctions), Japan will take a 
responsible step (to comply with the resolution) within the 
boundary of the Constitution." 
  Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a lecture meeting 
Thursday the premier's vow to act in accordance with the 
Constitution implies Japan's readiness to revise laws to impose 
economic sanctions. 
  The United States has been asking Japan to block the annual 
flow of cash remittances to North Korea from the pro-Pyongyang 
Korean community, whose size Japanese intelligence reportedly 
estimated at 180 to 200 billion yen. 
  The SDP, which has long maintained friendly ties with the 
(North) Korean Workers' Party, has consistently balked at 
Japan's possible participation in the economic sanctions. 
  The U.N. Security Council is now sketching out a resolution 
following Thursday's report to it by Hans Blix, director general 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Pyongyang broke 
its vow to allow its inspectors to take samples of radioactive 
materials from its suspected nuclear arms facilities.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- Japan has been discussing 
North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development program with 
South Korea and the United States to formulate its own policy on 
the issue, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said Friday. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news 
conference that the premier told cabinet members he had compared 
notes on the nuclear threat from North Korea with visiting South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam. He also said Tokyo has been 
discussing the issue with Washington, the top government 
spokesman said. 
  But Hosokawa said it will take time before the government 
decides on its own policy to help resolve the North Korea issue. 
  Meanwhile, Takemura welcomed Russia's proposal to hold an 
international conference on Pyongyang's nuclear program, adding 
that Tokyo will seek further information about the proposal from 
Moscow. 
  Russia on Thursday proposed the holding of an international 
parley on the issue, saying it should be attended by Russia, 
China, the U.S., Japan, and North and South Korea, as well as 
representatives of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
and the United Nations secretary general.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- Japanese automakers have 
proposed resumption of their talks with American carmakers to 
help break an impasse in bilateral framework trade talks. 
  In its "action plan for international cooperation," the 
Japan 
Automobile Manufacturers Association on Thursday [24 March] also 
proposed inviting smaller parts makers in the U.S. to regular 
business negotiations between Japanese carmakers and major U.S. 
parts makers. 
  The action program was published to coincide with the 
government's planned market-opening measures to be announced 
shortly. It is apparently designed to help break the ice in the 
framework trade negotiations, which broke down in February. 
  The private-sector talks were held twice in 1992 but no 
bilateral discussions have taken place since. 
  Following the program, Japan's five biggest carmakers 
including Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. will 
separately announce individual schemes for purchases of U.S 
parts.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii on Friday ruled out any pledge to repeat this year's tax 
cuts in a package of market-opening measures to be announced 
next week. 
  Despite suggestions in the government that a renewal of the 
6 
trillion yen cuts in income tax and resident's tax be written 
into the package due by month's end, Fujii told a regular press 
conference after a morning cabinet meeting that he "can't 
imagine" including further cuts without specific financing. 
  He repeated that the ruling parties have vowed to enact 
permanent tax reform by year's end, saying it is now under 
"serious debate." The tax overhaul is expected to cut income 
taxes and raise such indirect levies as the consumption tax. 
  Fujii declined comment on a reported basic agreement by the 
ruling coalition and opposition parties to spell out the 
extension of the tax cuts as an addendum to a tax revision 
package now under deliberation in the Diet. 
  He said the coalition and opposition parties "are still in 
the stage of discussing" the idea. 
  Fujii said there is little time to include new items in the 
package due out next Tuesday. But he said "things are moving 
and may change," suggesting that new macroeconomic measures 
could be included later. 
  He said he did not discuss macroeconomic measures when he 
met 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura on Thursday. 
  But Takemura, the chief government spokesman, told a 
separate 
press meeting Thursday that while he wants to show the 
"direction" of government policy on tax cuts and other 
macroeconomic measures in the March package, details would take 
until June to work out. 
  Takemura also said he "fully recognized" the Finance 
Ministry's "unchanged" stance. 
  In Friday morning's press meeting, Fujii said the 
government's policy on the package remains unchanged to "take 
voluntary actions on four items and in three priority areas" in 
the Japan-U.S. framework talks. 
  U.S. officials have said that a single-year tax cut is 
insufficient to spur domestic demand and help cut Japan's trade 
surplus, and have called for additional macroeconomic measures. 
  They have also said the U.S. will assess the possibility of 
resuming the stalled framework talks based on Japan's March 
package. 
  Fujii said macroeconomic measures should be taken 
"voluntarily" and not as an international promise, and that this 
point had been agreed by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and 
President Bill Clinton at their meeting in February. 
  Asked about the effect of planned utilities rate hikes, 
Fujii 
said they would not offset the benefits of the tax cuts, noting 
that the planned hikes were assumed in the government's economic 
forecast for fiscal 1994.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- Taxes collected by local 
governments in fiscal 1992 shrank by 1.4 percent from the 
previous year to 34,568.3 billion yen due to the country's 
prolonged economic slump, according to a government report 
released Friday [25 March]. 
  The report submitted by Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato to 
the day's regular cabinet meeting said local tax revenues for 
the year that ended March 31, 1993 were down for the first time 
since fiscal 1975. 
  The report, however, said local governments' total revenues, 
including local taxes and subsidies from the central government, 
came to 91,423.8 billion yen in fiscal 1992, up 6.7 percent from 
the previous year. 
  Expenditures by local governments increased 6.9 percent to 
89,559.7 billion yen, according to the report. 
  The amount of bonds issued by local governments reached 
10,099.7 billion yen, representing an increase of 40.5 percent 
from a year before. 
  The figure brought the debt of local governments to some 79 
trillion yen by the end of the fiscal 1992, the report said.

  [Text] According to a report from the Commerce Ministry, 
during the negotiations on tax reduction under the General 
Agreement of Tariffs and Trade, the United States demanded that 
Thailand reduce its tariffs imposed on cinematographic film 
imports from 10 to 2 baht per meter. However, Thailand insisted 
on the minimum rate of 5 baht per meter and would agree to 
further lower the tariffs only if the United States removes it 
from the (PWL) watchlist. 
  Regarding the U.S. call for the calculation of import tax 
based on the value of the imports, the Finance Ministry said 
that it could not give up the present calculation system, which 
is based on the condition of the imported goods. However, 
futher details of the present tax calculation system will be 
spelled out in the memorandums on trade with the United States 
and New Zealand so as to convince the two countries that their 
exports to Thailand will not be subject to high import duties, 
at least, not higher than those calculated in the U.S.-proposed 
system.

  [Text] Pratyathawi Tawethikun, deputy permanent secretary 
of the Foreign Ministry, commented during a press briefing this 
afternoon on the U.S. citing Thailand as a country where the sex 
trade and the exploitation of women and children are rampant. 
He said that the Thai Government has been trying to both 
suppress and prevent prostitution and the abuse of women and 
children. He said the problem exists not only in Thailand, but 
everywhere, and therefore it is unfair to accuse Thailand in 
that manner. 
  Regarding the procurement of Thai women for prostitution 
abroad, the deputy permanent secretary said those responsible 
for the trade are foreigners, including the American people 
themselves who lure Thai women for prostitution with the 
connivance of Thai people. He believed other countries have an 
understanding for Thailand regarding the U.S. accusation. The 
Foreign Ministry and Thai embassies will explain this matter to 
foreigners for the sake of better understanding. They will also 
launch a campaign to prevent Thai women from being lured for 
prostitution abroad.

  [Text] Police have asked four unidentified countries to 
check if sketches of two suspects in the "truck bomb" conspiracy 
look like anybody in their terrorist blacklists, police chief 
Prathin Santipraphop said yesterday. 
  Prathin also said he was "not confident at all" that Thai 
police would be able arrest the culprit behind the foiled 
attempt to carry out what could have been the worst sabotage on 
Thai soil. He added it was most likely the criminals had fled 
overseas. 
  "I have sent the sketches of two suspects to four countries, 
which I can't name at the moment, in the hope they may know 
their identities," Prathin said. Those countries have official 
organizations which keep records of international terrorists, he 
added. 
  Asked if Thai police would be able to arrest the culprits, 
Prathin said: "I'm not confident at all." He added that he was 
not afraid of the "political consequences" of his remark. 
  Pratin said the large amount of fertilizer found in a truck 
abandoned by an Arab-looking man near the Israeli Embassy in 
March 11 after a minor accident was uria nitrate, not ammonium 
nitrate as previously reported. 
  "I've checked with foreign experts and it turns out the bomb 
does not have as much destructive power as we first thought," he 
said. 
  Meanwhile, a police source said one of the terrorists behind 
the conspiracy is believed to be among three men still at large 
after bombing the World Trade Centre in New York in February 
last year. The source said Mir Aimal Kansi 30, is one of the 
three suspects. The combined rewards for information leading to 
his arrest in connection with the worst terrorist act on US soil 
amounts to $2 million. 
  Police suspect this man was behind Bangkok's truck-bomb 
attack but that he fled the country through a border point in 
Songkhla province last week. 
  The source said officials at Sadao district, on the border 
with Malaysia, remembered a man "who looked like an Arab" 
crossing the frontier on March 15. They had photocopied his 
fake Pakistani passport. 
  The source said the picture in the passport looked like 
Kansi 
except that his haircut had been changed. 
  About 300 senior metropolitan police officers attended a 
special meeting yesterday on how to cope with saboteurs using 
explosives. The meeting at the metropolitan police headquarters 
was held because "metropolitan police have no knowledge about 
how to cope with suspicious objects or explosive materials," 
according to Pol Maj Gen Somchai Praphatpakdi, deputy Bangkok 
police chief.

  [Text] Thailand should tell the United Nations of its 
concern over the thousands of Cambodians fleeing military action 
by their government and seek the setting up of a safe area for 
them in Cambodia, not Thailand, according to a high-ranking 
government source. 
  The UN in New York should be informed by letter about the 
situation in Chanthaburi province, on the Thai-Cambodian border, 
where about 30,000 Cambodians, many the families of Khmer Rouge 
fighters, have fled, the source said. 
  UN agencies such as United Nations Border Relief 
Organisation 
and the International Red Cross should immediately help by 
setting up safe areas on Cambodian territory. The United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is limited in its 
function and can provide humanitarian assistance only on the 
Thai side. 
  The source said Thailand does not want to shoulder the 
burden 
of caring for Cambodians fleeing attacks by their own government 
and wishes that the fighting should end soon for the sake of the 
people and the country. 
  "Thailand shouldered the burden of Cambodian refugees for 
years before UN agencies and other organizations stepped in," he 
said. 
  According to the source, Khmer Rouge troops may attack a 
government military base in Cambodia's Battambang province 
bordering Thailand's Sa Kaew province and the Cambodian 
government troops there may seek help from Thai troops across 
the border. 
  "An attack there would result in an additional influx of 
Cambodians into Thailand. Thai authorities know of the 
possibility and will soon meet to arrange a plan for the fleeing 
Cambodians," he said. 
  The Foreign Ministry will raise the issue with Cambodian 
Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut who will visit Bangkok 
for two days, starting on Monday. 
  Cambodia will provide additional time to Thai loggers 
hauling 
logs out of the country on a case-by-case basis, depending on 
payment, an informed source said. The present deadline for 
removing the logs is March 30.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai today granted an 
interview to reporters at the Bangkok International Airport 
before making an official trip to the southern province of 
Pattani on the fighting situation in Cambodia. 
  He said that according to the latest information received, 
25,000 Cambodians have fled into Thai territory. Thailand 
therefore has to provide them with shelter and safety in line 
with humanitarian practice. No time period has been set for 
repatriation. They will be sent home once the fighting in 
Cambodia ends. In case the problem becomes a prolonged one, the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will be requested 
to take care of them again. At the time being, he was not sure 
whether coordination has been made with the UN. 
  On the question of Cambodian armed forces encroaching on 
Thai 
territory, the prime minister said that if that happens, 
Thailand will have to take action in accordance with the rules. 
Any Cambodian faction would have to be disarmed in order to 
avoid any international conflict. 
  On the fear that the Thai border will be used as a base for 
a 
Cambodian faction, Chuan said that issue should not be a 
concern, as he has instructed the officials involved to prevent 
such problems from occurring. Therefore, the Thai people should 
feel relaxed on this matter.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak has 
concluded an official visit to Finland successfully. During the 
visit, during 17 to 20 March 1994, the deputy prime minister 
paid a courtesy call on Prime Minister Esko Aho and had 
consultations with Deputy Prime Minister [title as heard] (Kari 
Hopanatti) and Finnish business leaders as well as members of 
Finland-ASEAN Society. On trade cooperation, the two sides 
expressed satisfaction with rapid increase in trade between the 
two countries. Thailand asked Finland to increase imports from 
Thailand and give Thailand generalized system of preferences, or 
GSP. Both countries emphasized a new role of trading gateways 
to Indochina, Commonwealth of Independent States, and Russia. 
  During the visit, the two countries signed an agreement for 
investment promotion and protection. Thailand wants Finland to 
make direct investment in Thailand without going through a third 
country. Finland agreed to send experts to help Thailand on 
science and technology. It also asked to increase flight 
frequency to Bangkok to cope with tourist demand.

  [Text] Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin yesterday 
reported on the country's economic, capital, and financial 
markets to Prime Minister Chuan Likphai. During the meeting, he 
told the prime minister that the country's economy is 
progressing in a good direction. Some past problems have been 
tackled well. The Bank of Thailand is readjusting its economic 
growth forecast from 7.8 percent to 8 percent, an increase of 
0.2 percent. The growth rate is considered quite high. The new 
adjustment is likely to be announced in April. 
  Meanhwile, Tharin also said he has informed the prime 
minister that IMF officials would come to study and assess the 
Thai economy. The officials are specifically interested in the 
country's policy on wealth distribution to rural areas because 
they believe that Thailand has implemented such measures 
effectively. The IMF officials want clear a explanation of the 
policy so that it can be used as a guideline for conducting the 
study.

  [Text] The Science and Technology Association has urged 
the government to decide soon whether to build nuclear power 
plants or not, Chairman Phanot Mikasen said yesterday. 
  Phanot, who claimed that the nuclear option was safe, said 
the government should decide soon because nuclear power plants 
take 10 years to complete. 
  "We have to get prepared for so many things," he said, 
citing 
lack of expertise as an example. 
  Compared with fossil fuels, nuclear power is clean. It 
doesn't release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Phanot said. 
  Current resources such as lignite and water are becoming 
scarcer and consequently will become more expensive, he said. 
  "Nuclear power is the most suitable energy for Thailand," 
Phanot said. 
  With cooperation from Canadian experts, he said the 
association is studying technology regarding the disposal of 
radioactive waste. 
  The association is also coordinating with the Electricity 
Generating Authority of Thailand to train new people.

  [Text] In the year 2000 and beyond, Thai labourers will 
be increasingly exposed to changing market conditions, academics 
said. 
  To help them cope with the rigours of competition, academics 
suggested that the education level of labourers as well as their 
ability to take the initiative to learn new skills should be 
improved. 
  In the seminar, "The Thai economy in the Year 2000", at the 
Royal Orchid Hotel on Wednesday, Dr Pawadi Thong-uthai, an 
associate professor of economics at Thammasat University, said 
Thai manufacturing industries in the future will have to place 
greater emphasize more on efficiency, cost reductions and the 
adoption of new technology. [sentence as published] They will 
have to respond quickly to market demand. With improved 
communications technology, they may have to adapt production in 
response to market orders and rely on fast delivery. 
  "Thailand will see growth in the adoption of the subcontract 
system, such as in garments and jewelry. This will reduce 
labour costs and help diversify risks. As the market will be 
increasingly volatile, (under the subcontract system) the main 
company will not have to invest (so much) in machinery. They 
can rely on the facilities of small subcontracting factories," 
she said. 
  Pawadi said to add production flexibility, the main plant 
will hire only the best workers and subcontract part of the 
production to small factories. Employment will be separated 
into two main categories. The first class labourers working at 
the main plant will have higher wages and more job security. 
The second class workers in subcontracting factories will be 
hired temporarily to fill individual contracts. 
  The subcontract system has both advantages and 
disadvantages. 
  It helps a company compete, if it can ensure strict quality 
control and especially if the main factory assists the 
subcontracting factories in utilizing new production techniques. 
  "But the downside is that labourers (in subcontracting 
firms) 
will not have job security. Even in Japan (where lifetime 
employment is a common pattern) the second class workers are the 
first to be laid off," Pawadi said. They tend to work longer 
hours, and under pressure. 
  Most of these `second-class' labourers will have recently 
left the agricultural sector.

  [Text] The Philippine Government says it is ready to 
evacuate the Filipinos staying in South Korea in case tension 
escalates between Seoul and Pyongyang. The two Koreas have 
placed their armies on alert following the U.S. decision to 
station patriot missiles in South Korea. Administrator David 
Cortin of the Overseas Workers' Welfare Agency said there are 
some 6,000 registered Filipinos in South Korea. Cortin said the 
contingency plan for these Filipinos has been activated in the 
event the situation in Korea worsens. 
  The Philippine Government is concerned over the breakdown of 
U.S-North Korean dialogue over the nuclear arms inspection 
issue. Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo said the 
breakdown in the talks may isolate North Korea which may lead to 
a miscalculation from a nuclear perspective. Referring to fears 
of war in the Korean peninsula, President Ramos said support 
must continue for those seeking the right path to peace. 
  In the Senate, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Blas 
Ople 
said a war in the Korean peninsula can put the Philippines and 
other nations under obligation to send combat troops to fight 
under the United Nations flag. Ople's fear is shared by Senator 
Rodolfo Biazon who warned that moving Asian and UN troops the 
frontline will escalate tension which can explode into a full 
confrontation.

  [Text] A detained leader of the Communist Party of the 
Philippines (CPP) yesterday urged his comrades to continue the 
fight against the movement's Europe-based leadership and form a 
new party with a strong ideological foundation. 
  In an interview with newsmen, Arturo Tabara, one of the 
communist leaders opposing Jose Maria Sison, said "its never 
late" for the movement to make a comeback if all oppositionists 
in the party will "unite in forming a new party different from 
Sison's." He added, Mr. Sison's view of armed struggle as the 
best means to further the party's political agenda must be 
changed in order to give way to more important considerations of 
the times. 
  Mr. Tabara revealed that before his capture in Bacolod City 
last January, the oppositionists were already planning to 
establish a party with a different ideological base. 
  He has lost touch with his comrades, he said, but he 
remained 
hopeful of the emergence of the new party soon. Mr. Tabara said 
anti-Sisonists equal the strength of Mr. Sison's allies in terms 
of membership as they number 9,800 nationwide. He admitted, 
however, that Sisonists have more arms because they have more 
money.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Decelerated Growth of Textile Exports"] </F>
  [Text] The government considers the slow growth in the 
export of textiles and textile products between January and 
November 1993 to be a serious matter. The total export growth 
of non-oil/non-gas commodities last year reached 21.89 percent, 
but exports of textiles and textile products only increased by 
2.8 percent. Hartarto, coordinating minister for industrial and 
trade affairs, said this to reporters on Tuesday (8 March) after 
meeting President Suharto at the Bina Graha Presidential Office 
in Jakarta. He said that as a result, the government is going 
to handle the matter more seriously and will review existing 
policies by holding a coordinated meeting with the Department of 
Industry, Department of Trade, the Office of the Coordinating 
Minister for Economy and Finance, and the Bank of Indonesia. 
  According to Hartarto, efforts to look for new ways to make 
Indonesian textiles and textile products more competitive in the 
global market will be discussed at the coordinated meeting. The 
coordinating minister of industry and trade and other concerned 
ministers have already gathered all the facts relating to the 
textiles issue, and they will find concrete measures to solve 
the problem of slow export growth comprehensively. We can 
understand why the government is very concerned about the 
decelerated export growth of textiles and textile products. 
This is because they have always been the prime export 
commodities from the non-oil/non-gas sector. The fact that 
state receipts from the export of textiles and textile products 
earn the biggest foreign exchange earnings among exports outside 
of the non-oil/non-gas sector means that last year's slow export 
growth was acutely felt. 
  It is worrisome to see that the export of textiles and 
textile products rose by only 2.8 percent in 1993 compared to 
the growth of 35.59 percent in the export of processed wood. 
The export of processed wood is currently the second biggest 
contributor to foreign exchange earnings after textiles and 
textile products. 
  The decelerated export growth of textiles and textile 
products will probably disrupt the smooth flow of foreign 
exchange earnings into the country. The impact will be more 
serious this year with the price of oil in the international 
market falling to about $13 per barrel, largely due to 
oversupply and OPEC's indecision over what to do with the glut. 
  The fluctuating world oil price is expected to create a 
deficit in the 1994-1995 state budget. Finance Minister Mari'ie 
Mohammad says the government will be forced to draw on its 3.5 
trillion rupiah development fund reserves in order to offset the 
possible shortfall in revenue. The development fund reserves 
would not need to be drawn upon, however, if the export of 
non-oil/non-gas commodities could be accelerated to a level that 
would balance the declining exports of oil and gas. In any 
event, the export trend of non-oil/non-gas commodities depends 
on the export growth of textiles and textile products, which 
earn the biggest foreign exchanges. 
  The government was right when it decided to take serious 
measures to overcome every obstacle that is causing the slow 
export growth of textiles and textile products. There is no 
doubt that it will not be easy to solve the export problem, 
especially when it concerns textiles and textile products. 
  On one side, the producers and exporters of textiles and 
textile products have been urged to boost the export of their 
commodities to increase exports from the non-oil/non-gas sector 
and balance the budget deficit caused by the decrease in state 
receipts from oil and gas taxes. On the other side, the 
producers and exporters of textiles and textile products are 
bogged down by all kinds of impediments that hinder them in 
producing market quality products that can face stiff 
competition in the global market. 
  We often hear the exporters of non-oil/non-gas commodities 
complaining about the decelerated growth of their exports. They 
say that the high interest rate of bank loans, complicated 
export procedures, difficulties faced in importing raw 
materials, and the payment of other unnecessary costs that are 
not stated in the trade regulations have contributed to the slow 
export growth. It looks as if the time has come for the 
government to seek a comprehensive settlement on the issue of 
export procedures. Likewise, we used to ask the National Export 
Development Agency (BPEN) to look into ways to overcome problems 
faced by the Indonesian exporters. Do we need another 
institution, besides BPEN, to help exporters overcome their 
problems? 
  It is hoped that the inter-departmental coordinated meeting 
proposed by Hartarto will comprehensively discuss the factors 
that are causing the slow growth of commodity exports, 
especially textiles and textile products. We should take 
concrete measures to seek an effective solution to the problem 
in order to expedite and boost the export of non-oil/non-gas 
commodities.

<F P=106> ["Retractation of Unjust `Resolution' of IAEA Secretariat </F>
Urged"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- If the secretariat of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) failed to take 
steps to retract the unreasonable "resolution," we will be left 
with no other choice but to take practical measures commensurate 
with the widening partiality of the secretariat of the agency 
and the secretariat will be held wholly responsible for all the 
consequences to be entailed herefrom, said a spokesman of the 
General Department of Atomic Energy of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea in a statement today. 
  He said: 
  At the recent meeting of the board of governors of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, the forces hostile to the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea adopted an unreasonable 
"resolution" against it in defiance of the opposition of many 
countries and presented it to the United Nations Security 
Council. 
  This indicates that the IAEA Secretariat is further 
internationalizing the DPRK's "nuclear issue," joining the 
hostile forces in the efforts to stifle the DPRK, and is further 
widening its partiality, instead of rectifying it. 
  "The resolution" alleged that "the noncompliance with the 
safeguards agreement has grown in scope" because we did not 
allow some of the activities for the continuity of safeguards. 
This is an assertion totally reversing black and white. 
  Now we are in a special status with the temporary suspension 
of the effectuation of the DPRK's declared withdrawal from the 
nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. So, we are not under 
obligation to accept routine and ad hoc inspections under the 
safeguards agreement. 
  What we can allow at this moment is only an inspection for 
the maintenance of the continuity of safeguards. 
  The latest inspection by the inspectors group of the IAEA 
was 
enough to fully confirm that nuclear materials had not been 
diverted at our nuclear facilities and definitely maintain the 
continuity of safeguards. 
  Therefore, no one can find fault with the results of the 
recent inspection, saying they are "not satisfactory", and 
charge the DPRK with "non-compliance with the safeguards 
agreement." 
  We cannot but take a serious view of the fact that the 
"resolution" urged the DPRK to "immediately allow the IAEA to 
complete all requested inspection activities as the first step 
and to comply fully with the safeguards agreement." 
  During the recent inspection, we fully allowed all 
inspection 
activities needed for maintaining the continuity of safeguards 
in accordance with the Vienna Agreement, and we have nothing 
more to "allow." 
  The director general of the IAEA himself in his report and 
address at the meeting of the board of governors admitted that 
all inspection activities had been carried out satisfactorily as 
demanded by the IAEA Secretariat at most of the nuclear 
facilities. 
  As for the smear-taking in the glove box area at the 
radiochemical laboratory, with which the IAEA Secretariat takes 
an issue, it has nothing to do with the maintenance of the 
continuity of safeguards. 
  So, the insistence on smear-test in this area contradicts 
the 
Vienna agreement, which says that "this inspection does not 
include the verification of the completeness of the initial 
inventory of nuclear material." 
  Moreover, the smear-taking at the area is a matter of 
relevance to "inconsistency", an outstanding issue between the 
two sides. 
  However, out of the spirit of cooperation, we proposed the 
method of taking samples of tracer liquid whereby to inspect 
more effectively the glove-box area. 
  This liquid is what the Secretariat of the IAEA had put into 
the three tanks in the glove-box area during their earlier 
inspection to freeze the outflow of nuclear material in the 
area. Accordingly, solution samplings were enough to verify 
whether or not nuclear material had been diverted in the area. 
  The inspectors group itself agreed to our constructive 
proposal and took samples of tracer liquid there. 
  This notwithstanding, the IAEA Secretariat argued in a 
far-fetched manner that they could not "verify that no 
processing activities had occurred at the radiochemical 
laboratory", simply because their request to make a few smear 
tests was not accepted. This is unreasonable either from the 
scientific-technological point of view or in view of the Vienna 
agreement. 
  All the facts clearly prove that the purpose on the recent 
inspection by the IAEA Secretariat was not to verify whether 
nuclear materials had been diverted at our nuclear facilities, 
or not, but to pursue a sinister political aim from the 
beginning according to a pre-arranged strategy. 
  The IAEA Secretariat widened its partiality still further by 
adopting another unreasonable "resolution" at the meeting of the 
board of governors. 
  If the IAEA Secretariat really wants to see a fair solution 
to our nuclear issue it should take a measure to immediately 
withdraw its "resolution" based on the unjust assessment that 
the IAEA "could not draw any conclusion on whether nuclear 
materials had been diverted" to DPRK's nuclear facilities.

  [Text] Seoul, March 25 (YONHAP) -- A group of 
Korean-Americans hopes to send a delegation to North Korea to 
help defuse the nuclear crisis, it was reported Friday. 
  According to the Chicago Branch of the Korea Trade Promotion 
Corporation (Kotra), Yim Yong-kun, a member of the Oregon State 
Senate and chairman of the Korean-American Federation, has taken 
the initiative in forming the delegation. 
  So far, Yim has contacted Korean-American leaders in 30 
major 
U.S. cities to consult on the date, the size of the delegation 
and ways to get in touch with Pyongyang, Kotra officials quoted 
its office in Chicago as saying. 
  Yim hopes to form a delegation of about 20 persons, 
including 
a number of prominent businessmen, that would discuss not only 
political issues but economic cooperation with the North Korean 
Government, the officials said. 
  But if the visit came about, the delegation would likely go 
to Pyongyang as a group of American politicians and not at North 
Korea's official invitation, they said. 
  Yim, who was elected to the Oregon State Senate in November 
1992, has previously visited North Korea at Pyongyang's 
invitation. 
  Prior to the visit, he invited about 300 ethnic Koreans from 
the former Soviet Union and China to Washington in 1989 for a 
meeting of Koreans from around the world.

  [Text] Phnom Penh AKP March 25 -- His Majesty Norodom 
Sihanouk, king of Cambodia, has set the date of April 12 to hold 
the first in a series of people's audiences to hear the 
grievances of his "common people" from 9 a.m. to noon at the 
royal palace. 
  The king, who has recently been released from Beijing 
hospital where he received medical treatment for his tumour near 
prostrate area, is scheduled to return to Phnom Penh on April 8 
after his brief visit to North Korea. The following day he will 
officiate at a 90th anniversary memory ceremony for his late 
mother, Queen Kossamak Nearirat, and then meet envoys who have 
been accredited to Cambodia during his absence. 
  In his massage to his compatriots dated on March 23 and 
received by AKP today, the king said he would hear "five very 
serious problems or difficulties" in his first people's 
audiences. He, however, did not identify those five serious 
problems. 
  The people's audiences to hear grievances of the people date 
back to the 1950s and 1960s when the royal palace was open to 
hear and judge complaints. 
  "I know," the king said, "your problems are much more 
numerous than five, but we must make a choice." 
  Selections will be made by the high privy council of the 
king 
who will meet next week in the royal palace to examine any 
submitted problems. 
  The king has said previously he will only listen to the 
grievances and leave implementation of solutions to government 
officials.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 (YONHAP) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam proposed Thursday [24 March] that his country, 
Japan and China work together to control environmental pollution 
and promote joint study of oriental medicine and other projects. 
  Kim made the proposal during a breakfast meeting at the 
guest 
house with Korean correspondents stationed here. 
  Declaring that Korea, Japan and China are the three most 
important nations in Asia, Kim said they must undertake joint 
study of their common culture based on Chinese characters. 
  As China is rapidly undergoing industrialization, Kim said 
the Yangtse River, which runs into the West Sea, is becoming 
more polluted and the three countries must tackle the problem 
immediately. The Chinese Government has already agreed to his 
proposal at the working-level, Kim said. 
  As for oriental medicine, Kim noted there were slight 
differences among the three countries but the basic principles 
remained the same. That is why they need to work together to 
develop the field further, he said. 
  Kim said he hopes to obtain agreement on these issues from 
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin during summit talks. 
  Referring to the North Korean nuclear issue, Kim said 
developing nuclear weapons is a difficult undertaking but 
Pyongyang is not giving it up. 
  Kim said that when the North Koreans walked out of the 
inter-Korean contact last Saturday, the threat that "Seoul will 
turn into a sea of fire if war breaks out" was not just a 
personal remark by the chief delegate. He said he believed the 
statement came from North Korea's leadership. 
  President Kim also said China, in principle, does not want 
to 
see North Korea develop nuclear weapons. Since the world's eye 
is on China, Beijing would not do anything that would isolate it 
internationally, Kim said. 
  As a result, Kim expressed his belief that China would not 
use its veto power at the U.N. Security Council. 
  On other topics, Kim said he has accepted Emperor Akihito's 
apology Wednesday evening for the unfortunate past, or the 
Japanese colonial rule of Korea. 
  "His (the emperor's) apology was very clear and frank," Kim 
said. 
  "From now on, (South Korea) should stop demanding something 
from Japan, shake off the fetters of the past and look to 
future-oriented relations," he said.

  [Text] United Nations, March 24 (YONHAP) -- North Korea 
refused to let the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
fully check its seven declared nuclear sites during March 3-14 
inspections, IAEA Director-General Hans Blix told the U.N. 
Security Council on Thursday. 
  In a press conference after his report to the Security 
Council, Blix said that North Korea is capable of producing 
plutonium needed to manufacture atomic bombs and that the 
Stalinist country may have more plutonium than it has admitted. 
  As North Korea refused to allow IAEA experts to examine a 
radiochemical laboratory, one of seven declared nuclear 
facilities, the IAEA cannot verify the laboratory has not 
produced plutonium since February 1993 when it was last 
inspected. 
  To determine whether the laboratory has produced plutonium, 
sampling and gamma-ray tests are necessary, he added. 
  Blix said he does not know whether North Korea has the 
capability to produce nuclear weapons, but the IAEA has 
concluded that Pyongyang diverted plutonium from spent nuclear 
fuel on several occasions as a result of its inspections. This 
means the North Koreans have secured far more plutonium than 
they admitted in the gram unit.

  [Text] New York, March 24 KYODO -- The head of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) told the UN Security 
Council on Thursday [24 March] IAEA inspectors needed only three 
more days at North Korea's nuclear facilities to determine 
whether it is conducting a clandestine nuclear program. 
  IAEA Director General Hans Blix, whose inspectors visited 
North Korea from March 3 to 14, urged the Security Council to 
encourage North Korea to accept a short-term inspection to 
accomplish that goal. 
  British UN Envoy David Hannay indicated that the council 
members would respond positively to Blix's recommendation, 
telling reporters it remains important that the IAEA complete 
its inspections as originally intended. 
  The members were expected to confer on a draft resolution 
calling on North Korea to permit the inspections to be completed. 
  Blix briefed the council on North Korea's recent refusal of 
inspection of a key facility at its Yongbyon nuclear complex, 
which he said increased suspicion of its intentions. 
  IAEA inspectors were denied permission to collect samples at 
a radiochemical laboratory to help them determine whether 
reprocessing activities occurred there, which could imply 
diversion of plutonium for military use. 
  North Korea's official Radio Pyongyang, in a broadcast 
monitored in Tokyo on Friday, blasted the IAEA for adopting a 
resolution at its recent board of governors meeting referring 
the issue back to the UN Security Council for actions that could 
include sanctions. 
  Quoting from a statement issued Thursday by a spokesman for 
the General Department of Nuclear Energy, it warned that if the 
IAEA does not immediately retract the resolution then North 
Korea "will be left with no other choice but to take practical 
measures commensurate with the widening partiality of the 
agency." 
  The statement said North Korea is under no international 
legal obligation to accept routine and ad hoc inspections since 
it now has a "special status" by virtue of its temporary 
suspension of an earlier declaration of intent to withdraw from 
the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  It insisted that the latest IAEA inspection "was enough to 
fully confirm that nuclear materials has not been diverted."

<F P=106> [Romain Franklin report: "Pyongyang Ready for Dialogue... </F>
or War"] 
  [Text] Beginning today, the UN Security Council could 
consider adopting a resolution aimed at forcing the North Korean 
regime in Pyongyang to submit to inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Pak Dong-chun, the 
North Koreanrepresentative in Paris, told LIBERATION yesterday 
that his country will view the imposition of "economic or other" 
sanctions as a "declaration of war by the United States and 
those aligned with it, including France." His statements were 
confirmed by the official North Korean radio. "The situation on 
the Korean peninsula is at a very negative turning point," Pak 
Dong-chun said. He added that his country is "ready for 
dialogue, but also for all-out war, and that this is not just a 
lot of hot air." 
  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, who began a tour of 
Japan and China yesterday to rally support from the two 
countries, warned that "there were limits" to South Korea's 
"patience." The South Korean Armed Forces were put on a state 
of alert on Wednesday. 
  The annual U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers known as 
Team 
Spirit -- the holding of which was announced yesterday by Seoul 
-- would have "catastrophic" consequences, according to Pak 
Dong-chun. "Dialogue is still possible," he explained, "but 
first the maneuvers must be canceled." The imposition of UN 
sanctions and the actual installation of 160 Patriot antimissile 
missiles which Washington decided to station in South Korea 
"could lead to North Korea's definitive withdrawal from the 
Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons [NPT]." 
Pyongyang, which ratified the treaty in January 1992, announced 
its withdrawal from the NPT in March 1993, although it suspended 
the withdrawal in June, just one day before it was to take 
effect. 
  Yesterday, Russia suggested convening an international 
conference to find "a comprehensive settlement" to the crisis. 
According to Moscow, this conference will have to bring 
together "Russia, China, the United States, Japan, North Korea, 
and South Korea, as well as representatives of the UN secretary 
general and the IAEA director general."

  [Text] Speaking of the recent bombing incident in Bangkok, 
Pratyathawi Tawethikun, deputy permanent secretary of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs received information about it before the explosives were 
uncovered, but no exact date, time, and place of operation were 
known. Therefore, it was difficult to prevent the incident. 
However, more preventive measures are now required for 
important places, while cooperation is being undertaken with 
various countries in preventing serious incidents, and good 
relations are to be maintained with Middle East countries. 
  Talking about safeguarding peace and order in the country, 
Khachatphai Burutphat, deputy secretary general of the National 
Security Council, said that if everyone helps government 
authorities keep a close watch on the matter, he believed the 
acts marring public peace and order can be prevented. Besides, 
everyone is urged to have confidence in the ability of 
intelligence officials in carrying out their duties, because 
they have always been working attentively and trying to find 
ways to prevent mishaps. Additional preventive measures have 
also been implemented. 
  As for the development of the investigation into the case of 
international terrorist operations, Police General Prathin 
Santipraphop, director general of the Police Department, said 
that the arrest of the culprits seems unlikely because it is 
believed they have already left the country. However, 
cooperation has been sought with other countries that are 
expected to have a criminal background on the group of 
terrorists so that further police action can be taken to arrest 
them. 
  Meanwhile, the interior minister has called a meeting of 
officials concerned to follow up the case and find guidelines to 
prevent such incidents.

are are currently mature enough to face a leadership succession. 
Speaking during a news conference yesterday, the defense and 
security minister said national resilience, particularly in the 
face of the leadership succession, is in good condition and 
there is no situation that may lead to an upheaval. According 
to Minister Edi Sudrajat, national resilience must be 
consistently enhanced. Thus, the defense and security minister 
called on all parties to continue to enhance national resilience. 
  Meanwhile, Religious Affairs Minister Tarmizi Taher said the 
fact that Muslim scholars had directly asked the head of state 
about the leadership succession is proof of the high degree of 
their concern. In addition, the Muslim scholars hope that 
everything will proceed constitutionally for the sake of all 
Muslims.

<F P=106> [Article by Nguyen Ngoc Tuan, economic specialist at the Ho </F>
Chi Minh City Center for Social Sciences and the Humanities] 
  [Excerpts] Socialism does not differ from capitalism in the 
formulas used to operate or regulate the economy but in the 
system of ownership of the basic means of production and the 
distribution system appropriate to this. In Vietnam today, we 
have just developed a commodity economy and so the production 
forces have low standards and development is not balanced. But 
the ownership model has certain special characteristics: a. The 
capital concentrated in the hands of the state in the form of 
state-owned enterprises [Footnote 1] is dispersed among the 
sectors and regions. In reality, this is divided among the 
sectors and regions. b. Ownership rights to the assets at the 
state-owned enterprises are not clear. c. The asset ownership 
rights of the state and the commercial rights of the enterprises 
have been merged. Because of this, the ownership model has been 
made single too soon, and it is not in accord with a commodity 
economy or the standards of the production forces, with the 
result that the state enterprises lack vitality. It is difficult 
for them to respond promptly in the face of market changes. 
Approximately 70 percent have encountered many difficulties 
(they are operating at a loss, debts are piling up, assets are 
depreciating, there is a lack of capital, and so on). It is 
difficult for capital to move from sectors and regions with poor 
results to sectors and regions with good results in order to 
improve the economic results of all of society. 
  Given the specific conditions mentioned above, how should 
the 
state enterprise model be renovated? It can be said that this is 
a key point in the theory of a socialist commodity economy and 
the central element in the renovation of our country's economy 
system. In this article, I want to contribute ideas on this 
issue. 
The ineffectiveness of the traditional state enterprise 
model and the historical roots of this. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  The contract enterprise model--strengths and weaknesses. </H5>
  In this historical search, many countries have vacillated to 
the point of forgetting the principles, jumping from one side to 
the other and from "nationalization" to privatization, with the 
result that they have suffered economic defeats and political 
collapse. Some countries, however, have resolutely adhered to 
the basic guiding principles and "tied the eternal to the 
ephemeral." As a result, they have scored major victories in 
renovation and gained international recognition. 
  In our country, renovation of the state enterprise model got 
underway later, but in recent years, this model has undergone 
notable changes. The state has given up some of its powers, 
strengthened the rights of the state enterprises, greatly 
reduced the legal plans and norms and expanded the use of 
guiding plans and norms, and started collecting taxes instead of 
appropriating enterprise profits. Today, the state has switched 
to a "contract enterprise" model on a broad scale. The 
commercial assets of the enterprises are being evaluated based 
on the actual assets of the enterprise, rational profit levels 
are being determined, and norms to increase the assets, 
bonus-fine norms for the use of the assets, and profit-sharing 
norms in capital business are being established. At the same 
time, tests are being conducted in decentralizing state 
ownership at a number of state enterprises based on the "public 
enterprise" model. 
  As compared with previously improved state enterprise 
models, 
the "contract enterprise" model has several positive effects. 
Above all, this gives the enterprises greater independence with 
respect to managing and using the assets in accord with the 
laws. This encourages the laborers to pay attention to the 
results of the labor of both individuals and the collective 
(because their interests and income are tied to fulfilling or 
exceeding the contract norms). This encourages the enterprises 
to make production and the internal structure more efficient, 
provides a stable source of revenues for the state, and so on. 
However, this also has basic weaknesses: 
  This does not separate ownership functions from commercial 
functions, and because of this it does not eliminate direct 
interference by the administrative apparatus in the commercial 
production activities of the enterprises (in many cases, a 
number of localities and sectors even include their own tasks 
and contracts, which generates even greater interference). As 
Marx pointed out more than 100 years ago, capitalist commodity 
production will give rise to a wide gap between private 
ownership rights and command labor. Thus, capitalists do not 
have to be responsible for command labor. The person who owns 
the musical instruments of an orchestra, for example, does not 
have to be the conductor of that orchestra. The realities of our 
country show that the reason why enterprises outside the state 
sector are thriving is not because they have the "favor" of the 
state but because they have adequate commercial independence and 
are rarely subject to direct administrative interference. 
  This does not solve the problem of enterprises taking 
responsibility for profits and losses. To make up the losses, an 
enterprise must either use some of its existing capital or 
increase the price of its products. But no enterprise has 
sufficient existing capital to do this. And if an enterprise 
raises prices, how can it sell its goods, particularly at a time 
when cheap imports are being smuggled into the country in huge 
quantities? 
  The contracts cannot be met when outside factors (such as 
exchange rates, profit margins, prices, transportation 
conditions, the supply of raw materials, and energy) change. 
  This makes it difficult for the production factors to 
change, 
because the contract factors in the contract period do not 
change, it is difficult to change the payments, and the 
dependent relationship does not change. Furthermore, if a number 
of enterprises are achieving little or even suffering losses, 
all that needs to be done is to improve the situation a little 
and they can survive and keep from being disbanded. Clearly, 
this will block improving the results of all of society. 
  Because of the above weaknesses, even though the "contract 
enterprise" model is still attractive, in my view, in the future 
it will not be the best enterprise model in socialist ownership 
conditions. 
<H5>  Switch to an equity enterprise model </H5>
  For a long time prior to the sixth party congress, we 
mistakenly thought that the equity enterprise model was a 
separate sphere of capitalism and that this served capitalism. 
We thought that developing an equity economy would lead to 
privatization and smash the public ownership system, the 
foundation of socialism. Actually, the seed of an equity economy 
has existed since Roman times. By the first half of the 17th 
century, particularly after equity companies in England were 
legally recognized as independent legal persons, the first 
relatively stable equity corporations appeared consisting of 
shareholders and long-term investors. They could not withdraw 
their capital, but they had the right to transfer and trade 
shares. During the period 1820-1830, because of the requirements 
of the industrial revolution and the needs in building national 
markets, much capital was needed to build an infrastructure 
(relying just on the capital of individual capitalists would not 
have provided sufficient capital). Because of this, a number of 
equity corporations (such as railroad, mining, and power 
corporations) came into being and expanded quickly in Europe and 
America. Now, equity enterprises have become a widespread 
organizational model in many countries, particularly in the 
economically developed countries. In England, in 1862 there were 
only 165 equity corporations. By 1890, the number had risen to 
4,066 and by 1962 the number was 428,000, of which the majority 
were limited equity corporations. In the United States, in 1904 
only 23.6 percent of the enterprises were equity corporations. 
By 1947, this percentage had risen to 69 percent, and by 1962 
the percentage had risen to 78 percent. Today, the United States 
has more than 1.2 million equity corporations. 
  When studying the equity enterprise model under the 
capitalist system, Marx said that in an equity corporation, 
private ownership rights are separate from asset control rights, 
and these control rights are turned over to the "united 
laborers," that is, society. Through the equity enterprise 
system, the assets of the private capitalists invested in the 
corporation are transformed into direct social assets. From 
that, Marx concluded that the equity system will do away with 
private capital. As the equity economy expands and penetrates 
deeper and deeper into new production sectors, it will eliminate 
private capital more and more. This is a purely transitional 
point leading to a new form of production (meaning socialist 
production). 
  Viewed in this way, the equity enterprise model is not the 
product of capitalism. It is both the product of a commodity 
economy and the condition for expanding the commodity economy 
and expanding large-scale production and socialization. The 
striking characteristic--and also a strength--of the equity 
enterprise model is that it separates ownership rights from 
commercial rights, it separates administrative management from 
commercial management, and it really transforms the enterprises 
into relatively independent producers who are commercially 
independent, who are responsible for the profits and losses, and 
who are responsible for their own development. Under the equity 
system, the production rights of the enterprise are determined 
by the enterprise, and the share rights of the state and other 
shareholders are all equal. As the manager of society, the state 
collects taxes, and as an owner, it shares in the profits. Thus, 
the state will not have to concern itself with managing the 
enterprises as it did in the past. Because of this, it can 
concentrate its efforts on such things as formulating projects, 
setting guidelines for the growth of the sectors, monitoring and 
inspecting things, gathering information, and so on. Enterprise 
managers will be selected by the shareholders. They will form a 
management board to control the use, preservation, and growth of 
the capital and to ensure that better and better use is made of 
the capital. Implementing the equity enterprise model is an 
effective way to improve the isolated state enterprise model, 
create a competitive market system, encourage adequate 
competition, put an end to dividing state-owned assets by sector 
and region, and create channels for easily transferring 
production factors. With the equity enterprise model, the 
profitable enterprises will be able to issue and sell shares in 
order to expand production. As for those enterprises that are 
operating at a loss, because share prices will be low, they will 
go bankrupt or be taken over by other enterprises. This means 
that the sources of social strength will be integrated in an 
optimum way, and the results of the entire economy will improve. 
  Based on the above analysis, I think that the equity 
enterprise model should be the main guideline for renovating the 
ineffective state enterprise model in our country. Naturally, 
this model cannot reject the necessary existence of the state 
economic sector consisting of non-competitive state enterprises 
and enterprises that have a decisive effect on the national 
welfare and the people's livelihood and that maintain production 
stability and stabilize the markets. With respect to these 
enterprises, the state has a monopoly on investment for 
expansion and on control of production and markets. 
  The path of equitization in our country today is not one of 
turning private capital into social capital as under capitalism 
but one of restructuring the state enterprise model based on 
switching from absolute ownership by the state in which there is 
no competition to pluralistic ownership by society in which 
there is competition. At the same time, this will solve the 
problem of separating the ownership rights of the state from the 
commercial rights of the enterprises, eliminate direct 
administrative interference by authorities in commercial 
production, and eliminate domination and division of state-owned 
assets among the sectors and regions. At the microcosmic level, 
this will improve the production structure of the enterprises, 
accumulate capital, and strengthen vitality for production, and 
at the macrocosmic level, this will improve the traditional 
production system throughout society and effectively integrate 
national assets in order to improve economic results in general. 
  If we are to solve these two fundamental problems, we must 
not follow the privatization path of Western economists, who say 
that to develop a commodity economy, you must carry on 
privatization, develop a private economy, and then, when the 
private economy has accumulated capital, sell the state-owned 
enterprises to them and then equitize them. And we can't follow 
the path of shared-ownership enterprises, in which the 
state-owned assets are divided between the state and the 
enterprises. That would be unfair (because the assets of an 
enterprise are not created just by the labor of the workers and 
civil servants at that enterprise), and it would actually be 
harmful. In my view, the acceptable path is: 
  1. A state-owned asset management system must be built from 
the central central echelon to the localities. This must be 
independent of the state administrative management system. 
State-owned asset management rights must be separated from 
social administrative management rights, and the economic 
functions of the state must be directed toward the main tasks 
mentioned above. Only in this way will it be possible to 
maintain the independence and vitality of the enterprises, and 
thanks to this, the socialist system of public ownership will be 
solidified. 
  2. Under the unified control of the various-echelon 
state-owned asset management system, state-owned asset 
commercial corporations having a competitive nature must be 
built. These commercial corporations will not directly control 
or use the assets, but as owners, their function will be to 
monitor the use of the assets by the enterprises within the 
corporation. 
  3. After separating the two rights, pluralizing the 
ownership 
of the assets of the state enterprises, and building competitive 
markets, the large corporations and equity groups must actively 
be expanded and tied to each other with respect to occupations 
or products without regard to administrative boundaries in order 
to gradually establish social equity groups that are capable of 
carrying on commercial activities effectively and that have 
competitive strength on the markets. At the same time, an effort 
must be made to spread propaganda and guide people having 
capital (including cadres and workers) or social mass 
organizations in buying shares of the enterprise in order to 
attract the idle capital among the masses, reduce currency 
pressures on the markets, transform the idle capital into useful 
capital, and encourage the formation of a socialized investment 
mechanism and a pluralistic production structure. 
  The widespread implementation of the equity enterprise model 
requires that the necessary conditions be prepared: 
  There must be a fundamental change in viewpoint concerning 
socialist ownership, an equity economy, and the equity 
enterprise model. In guiding equitization, by sticking to 51 
percent equity ownership in an enterprise, not only will the 
state control the assets of that enterprise but it will also 
control other assets, which will enable the socialist ownership 
system to be solidified and expanded. Even if private 
individuals own a majority of the shares in a number of state 
enterprises, that will not be a problem, because even though the 
state-owned assets may have changed with respect to material 
form, they will not decline in value, and the state will recover 
capital for investment in other enterprises. This will improve 
the investment structure and benefit the expansion of the 
country's important projects. 
  The state-owned assets must be evaluated, and there must be 
rational measures to allocate these assets by ownership level in 
order to transform the absolute ownership rights of the state 
into the plural ownership rights of society. 
  The market system and market mechanisms must be improved. 
This includes the various production factors (such as capital, 
labor strength, technical materials, and information). Steps 
must be taken to enable input factors to move easily throughout 
society. 
  Prices and profit margins among the sectors must gradually 
be 
"marketized," and prices must be regarded as a function of 
market supply and demand in order to ensure fair competition 
between enterprises. 
  The financial and national tax systems must be improved, and 
budget revenues and expenditures must be tied closely to each 
other. Tax measures that will benefit fair competition and 
stimulate production must be implemented. The tax collection and 
after-tax profit laws used by the ownership echelons must be 
relied on. Smuggling must be dealt with appropriately. 
  Ranks of equity enterprise and corporation leaders who know 
how to manage business and who have a thorough knowledge of 
markets, particularly bond markets and international markets, 
and the business principles of equity enterprises must be built. 
  Unemployment and unemployment insurance measures managed by 
the state and housing measures managed by the cadres and workers 
must be implemented in order to simplify the targets of the 
enterprises and help the enterprises reach the markets.

  [Text] A special characteristic of the oil and gas industry 
in Vietnam is that 100 percent of the products are imported from 
abroad and then sold on domestic markets. Since 1991, 
approximately 3 million tons of oil and gas have been sold on 
domestic markets each year. That is the equivalent of $600 
million. (Most of the oil and gas is imported from Zone II 
markets.) 
  In previous years, the state made the Oil and Gas General 
Corporation (Petrolimex), which is subordinate to the Ministry 
of Commerce, responsible for all commercial aspects, including 
import and distribution functions, and for providing unified 
support on markets nationwide. But since 1991, various 
corporations (such as the Oil and Gas Import-Export Corporation, 
the Central Petroleum Corporation, the Saigon Petrol 
Corporation, the Vung Tau Joint Oil and Gas Services 
Corporation, and the Aviation Oil and Gas Corporation) and also 
a number of other units and organizations in the southern 
provinces have been participating in commercial activities and 
competing against the Oil and Gas General Corporation. 
  We realize that along with switching to a market mechanism, 
it is necessary to have many business entities and competition 
among the entities in order to prevent monopolies, give vitality 
to market activities, improve results, improve the quality of 
the commercial activities, and serve the consumers better. But 
what should be pointed out here is that competition on the oil 
and gas markets in Vietnam today is very different from this. 
Competition today is spontaneous and disorderly and is carried 
on to serve local and individual interests rather than to 
support production and the lives of the people. This is why the 
corporations and commercial organizations subject to state 
ownership lack wholesome competition and have failed to achieve 
results in importing and distributing oil and gas. 
  There are several main problems in our country's oil and gas 
markets that need to be given attention: 
  First, a number of corporations, units, and organizations 
engage in tax evasion (in both import and distribution 
activities). The state is losing both import duties and income 
taxes. According to regulations currently in force, the import 
duty on each ton of oil and gas is 40 percent of the import 
price, and the income tax is about 2 percent of the selling 
price. If a ton of imported oil and gas costs $220, the import 
duty is $88 (which is about 1 million dong). And if the selling 
price of a ton of oil and gas (approximately 1,200 liters) is 3 
million dong (2,500 dong per liter times 1,200), the income tax 
is 60,000 dong (2 percent times 3 million dong). Thus, for every 
ton of oil and gas on which the taxes are not paid, the state 
loses 1,060,000 dong in revenues. According to statistics, of 
the approximately 3 million tons of oil and gas imported and 
sold every year in Vietnam today, the Oil and Gas General 
Corporation handle approximately 72 percent (about 2.16 million 
tons). The other corporations and commercial organizations 
handle approximately 28 percent (about 840,000 tons). Basically, 
the state can control and collect only the taxes owed by the Oil 
and Gas General Corporation. The state cannot control or fully 
collect the large percentage of the taxes owed by the other 
corporations and commercial organizations. 
  Second, because of tax evasion, competition between the oil 
and gas enterprises is not fair. As we know, the Oil and Gas 
General Corporation, which is directly managed by the state, 
must perform two functions: it must carry on profitable 
operations and also provide oil and gas to support the targets, 
including remote locations such as the mountainous areas where 
transportation is difficult and expensive, at unified "ceiling 
prices" (without distinction between remote and nearby and 
difficult and easy markets). In this situation, it is obviously 
difficult for the the Oil and Gas General Corporation to remain 
dynamic and keep up with market changes, and it is hard for it 
to compete with other oil and gas corporations and enterprises 
that are not directly controlled by the state. Because they are 
not directly managed by the state, these corporations and 
commercial organizations can not only avoid paying taxes but 
they can also easily raise or lower oil and gas prices instead 
of adhering to the state's stipulated price. Actual surveys have 
shown that the selling price of a liter of A76 gasoline in July 
1993 varied as follows: In Hanoi, a liter sold for 2,900 dong 
while in Danang it cost 2,500 dong. In Ho chi Minh City it cost 
2,400 dong, and in Can Tho the price was 2,300 dong. Clearly, 
these prices do not reflect a wholesome and fair nature in 
commerce. The main reason for this is that many oil and gas 
corporations and enterprises avoid paying taxes and so they can 
sell their products at a price below the stipulated price. 
Another reason for this is that they don't have to incur 
expenses in transporting gasoline to distant markets. 
  Third, because the oil and gas business lacks unified 
organization and management, investments have been skewed, and 
much capital has been wasted. It is estimated that the 
corporations that became involved in the oil and gas business 
just recently have invested more than 630 billion dong to build 
storehouses and to purchase means of transportation. At the same 
time, according to data of the Oil and Gas General Corporation, 
the existing storehouse system and means of transportation are 
adequate to satisfy the needs for storing and transporting all 
the oil and gas needed. 
  In order to solve the above problems, in my view, the 
following measures should be implemented: 
  1. The state must implement a mechanism to reestablish order 
in the oil and gas markets with respect to imports and internal 
distribution. The question is: On what viewpoints should this 
order be reestablish? In order to reestablish order, on one 
hand, there must be many commercial subjects to compete with and 
stimulate each other in order to improve commercial results and 
quality and to satisfy the varied needs of consumers. On the 
other hand, in terms of mechanisms, the state must have concrete 
and binding stipulations on commercial functions and 
responsibilities and commercial locations (nearby and remote) 
for each oil and gas business subordinate to the state sector. 
At the same time, commercial activities, from importing to 
distributing oil and gas within the country, must be monitored 
closely and tax evasion must be opposed in order to increase 
budget revenues. Based on this, fair competition must be ensured 
between the various types of subjects. This means that in all 
circumstances, to hit the state's macrocosmic targets of 
collecting the taxes in full and stabilizing the markets, market 
safety and civilization must be maintained based on the 
principle of "ensuring national interests and not interfering 
directly in the commercial activities of the primary-level 
economic units." The oil and gas business must be maintained 
based on a state-controlled market mechanism. There must be 
flexible coordination between commercialization of prices and 
oil and gas "ceiling price" management on markets nationwide. 
  2. In order to ensure that state control of the oil and gas 
sphere is effective, the immediate thing is to reorganize the 
system of oil and gas corporations and units and not to have too 
many oil and gas import centers or too many oil and gas import 
corporations and enterprises as at present. At a level of 3 
million tons of oil and gas a year, we need only about four 
commercial subjects. This is a sector in which in the state 
monopolizes business. Thus, units and individuals cannot be 
allowed to "dominate" business and run after profits alone. 
  In reality, the oil and gas subjects used to have a close 
relationship, but because they are subordinate to many different 
organizations, they compete for profits. On the other hand, the 
organizational system has many intermediary echelons and is 
dispersed, and this has created many difficulties for oil and 
gas activities throughout the country. In order to overcome this 
situation, the state's macrocosmic management mechanism with 
respect to the oil and gas sector must be changed. First of all, 
oil and gas prices must be stipulated based on having "ceiling 
prices by region" and stimulating the corporations in remote 
areas, particularly the mountain areas. Through this, it will be 
possible to bring about fairness in business and differentiate 
commercial areas (near and far) based on stimulating things 
using prices. In cases in which a subject must carry out both 
commercial tasks and political and social tasks, the state must 
implement concrete policies on prices, particularly for 
transportation expenses for long trips. 
  3. Viewpoints must be renovated, and forms for participating 
in domestic oil and gas activities must be expanded for the 
economic elements. Should the "dealer" form, in which foreign 
economic elements can open dealerships to sell oil and gas to 
the oil and gas corporations of the state, be used? Based on the 
experiences of Malaysia, of the 385 state oil and gas 
enterprises, Petronas, the state oil and gas corporation, has 
directly invested in only seven of 7 of the enterprises in order 
to provide a model and gain experience in managing and guiding 
things. The other 378 businesses are all dealerships. Using the 
"dealership" form has the following effects: 
  Adaptations to changes in the oil and gas market can be made 
quickly, trading periods are longer, and sellers are tied more 
closely to the business because it is more profitable. 
  The staff can be reduced quite a bit. For example, the Zone 
1 
Oil and Gas Corporation presently has 70 stations with more than 
500 employees selling oil and gas retail. Altogether, the 
corporation employs 1,300 people. If the dealership form is 
used, this staff can certainly be reduced by about 30 percent. 
  This will put a stop to the negative aspects and corruption 
in the retail sale of oil and gas, because there will be 
unanimity between dealers and commercial interests. 
  The above effects will improve the commercial results of 
each 
station and of the entire oil and gas sector in our country. 
  Naturally, there must be a mechanism to manage the dealers, 
and the state oil and gas corporations must directly manage the 
dealerships with respect to the technical aspects.

Politics] 
  [Text] In our country's rural areas today, there are more 
than 987,000 party members active in more than 630,000 party 
chapters. They live and carry on activities together with more 
than 80 percent of the country's population in more than 8,800 
villages composed of more than 50,000 hamlets. These party 
members play a very important role in the movement to develop 
rural life and our country's agriculture in all respects. 
  Reality shows that the strength of the party members and of 
the movements in the rural areas depends mainly on the quality 
of the core cadres at the primary level. There is no doubt about 
this. 
  1. Looking at the past 8 years of carrying on renovation, in 
difficult conditions, most of the primary-level cadres in the 
rural areas have remained zealous and dedicated to the work, and 
they have overcome the difficulties, maintained their quality, 
and striven to complete the tasks assigned them. Some of the 
primary-level cadres have matured, actively overcome the 
difficulties, expanded agriculture with a commodity production 
orientation, begun to tie production to markets, and contributed 
to changing the socioeconomic situation in the rural areas in 
basic and important ways. 
  Result will vary depending on the region and base, but 
clearly, if most of the cadres fail to maintain their quality 
and prestige and cadres lack the ability to carry out the tasks, 
it will not be possible to make good changes in the various 
spheres in the rural areas. 
  Surveys in a number of localities show that 77 percent of 
the 
cadres in general, 69.7 percent of the cadres in the 10 primary 
positions, and almost 75 percent of the cadres in the 3 key 
positions have made a great effort to carry out the tasks. 
  Some people say that the great leap forward made by our 
country's rural areas and agriculture is due to the fact that 
the mechanism has been renovated and not to the ranks of 
primary-level cadres. But that is not true. It's true that this 
is due in large part to the mechanism. But without people, how 
could the mechanism "enter" life? Furthermore, the mechanism is 
set up by people. Without people, how could there be a 
mechanism? The reason why the mechanism to renovate agricultural 
management has been able to manifest strength is that it has 
been developed, tested, and reviewed at the primary level. The 
great achievements scored by the primary-level cadres are very 
clear and cannot be denied. 
  The rural area cadres have matured through production and 
work realities, and they are tied to production and the lives of 
the people in the locality. Because of this, they have the 
capabilities to find real solutions to the conflicts and 
problems that arise in the rural areas. This is a great and very 
basic advantage. At the same time, among these cadres, a rather 
large percentage have undergone training and matured in the 
military and in organizations, enterprises, and schools. 
Statistics from a number of localities show that in the 10 
primary positions, 58 percent are demobilized soldiers and 3 
percent are retired cadres. As for the three key positions, the 
percentages are 64 percent and 6 percent respectively. This is a 
special characteristic of the ranks, because their structure has 
undergone clear changes during the past 15 years. 
  The average age of the rural area cadres has gradually 
declined, forming clear age-group categories. In 1992, surveys 
conducted at 100 villages in five rural areas representative of 
the entire country showed that 40 percent of the cadres were age 
35 or below (an increase of 2.3 percent as compared with 1989), 
34 percent were between the ages of 36 and 45 (an increase of 
1.8 percent as compared with 1989), and 26 percent were 46 or 
older (a decline of 0.8 percent as compared with 1989). In 
particular, in the three key positions, 47 percent of the cadres 
were 40 years old or younger (a decline of 3 percent); 42.5 
percent were 41-45 (a decline of 2.8 percent); and 10.5 percent 
were 51 or older (a decline of 1.1 percent). 
  Another point that must be affirmed is that the 
primary-level 
cadres, particularly those in the key positions, have made 
important advances with respect to cultural, theoretical, and 
managerial standards. As for cultural standards, 50 percent of 
the cadres have level-II standards, and 26.3 percent have 
level-III standards. In the 10 primary positions, 54.5 percent 
have level-II standards, and 38.4 percent have level-III 
standards. As for political theory standards, in the 10 primary 
positions, 52 percent have elementary standards, and 18 percent 
have middle- and high-level standards, and in the 3 key 
positions 35.1 percent have elementary standards and 38 percent 
have middle- and high-level standards. As for managerial 
standards, in the key positions, 24 percent have studied 
economic management, and 18 percent have studied state 
management. In each of these spheres, the percentage has 
increased an average of 1.8-2.5 percent as compared with 1989. 
What should be pointed out is that at many bases, this factor 
has played a decisive role with respect to development in the 
locality. 
  2. However, it must be admitted that among the ranks of 
rural 
area cadres, there are many problems that need to be solved. 
  Surveys conducted at many village bases show that 14 percent 
of the cadres in general, 17-21 percent of the cadres in the 10 
primary positions, and more than 16 percent of the key cadres 
need to be replaced. The limitations of the primary-level cadres 
in the rural areas today are evident in the following main 
aspects: 
  First, the standards of a large percentage of the cadres are 
low (also, there are rather wide variations between regions). In 
the 10 primary positions, more than 11 percent of the people 
have level-I cultural standards (in the Central Highlands the 
percentage is 17 percent). In the three key positions, more than 
8 percent have only a level-I education (more than 14 percent in 
the Central Highlands). As for economic management standards, in 
the 10 primary and 3 key positions, the percentages of people 
who have received training are 11 percent and 24 percent 
respectively. The percentages for state management standards are 
8.2 and 18 percent respectively. 
  For the entire rank of cadres, with respect to cultural 
standards, 19 percent have only a level-I education (more than 
58 percent in the Central Highlands), and almost 2 percent are 
illiterate (17.2 percent in Gia Lai and Kontum Provinces). Only 
3 percent have received training in economic management, and 
only 2 percent have received training in state management. 
  In general, cadres in the rural areas have not been trained 
in all respects, and they cannot carry out the tasks assigned 
them. Because of this, in carrying out the tasks, they rely 
mainly on their experience and do things in an arbitrary manner. 
They do not do things democratically, and they act in an 
irresponsible manner. This is the case in many places to varying 
degrees. 
  Second, the forces of young cadres are still sparse, and the 
number of female cadres, of whom there are already very few, is 
clearly declining. Surveys conducted in 19 villages in Thai 
Binh, Quang Nam-Danang, and Minh Hai Provinces during 1991 and 
1992 show that in the 10 primary positions, only 15 percent of 
the cadres are below the age of 30, and only 10 percent are 
women (both categories have declined an average of 0.6 percent 
as compared with 1989). In the three key positions, only 5 
percent of the cadres are below age 30, and only about 1 percent 
are women (a drop of 0.2 percent). In particular, surveys 
conducted in 11 villages in Hai Hung, Thua Thien-Hue, and Ha Tay 
Provinces show that 10 of the villages do not have any female 
cadres in the three key positions. 
  The same is true nationwide. Of those participating at the 
village party committee echelon during the period 1991-1993, 
only 17 percent of the cadres were below the age of 30, and only 
11 percent of the cadres were women. Those are alarming figures 
that need to be given attention. 
  Third, the work style of cadres in general is administrative 
and bureaucratic in nature. Above all, the key village cadres 
meet too often. We noted that in seven villages in two 
provinces, during the first 3 months of 1992, there was an 
average of seven meetings a month. The activities of many 
primary-level cadres, particularly those in the 10 primary 
positions, consist mainly of going from their homes to their 
offices. Because of this, they are unaware of what is happening 
in the hamlets and villages or learn about what has happened 
only much later. 
  3. The material and spiritual lives of the primary-level 
cadres are very difficult, and many of these cadres have many 
desires and concerns. 
  Surveys conducted in six villages in Hai Hung and Minh Hai 
provinces show that up to 9 percent of the families are poor. As 
for those cadres who were "pillars" in previous years and who 
have remained loyal, upright, and incorruptible, they and their 
families are still living in poverty. Most of the recent 
arrivals are former soldiers who have just matured. Because of 
this, they are in dire economic straits. 
  The "hunger" for information among primary-level cadres is a 
widespread phenomenon. Normally, each village receives only a 
few newspapers, and these are reserved for the key cadres. Their 
information is mainly in the form of official letters and 
directives from higher echelons. The rest comes from listening 
to the radio, but fewer than half of the cadres have a radio. In 
the past, a number of villages had a system of public 
loudspeakers, but because of poor management and the elimination 
of state subsidies, almost all of these are broken. Because 
economic life is still difficult, few primary-level cadres are 
able to obtain information and study on their own in order to 
raise their standards. 
  For several years now, many places have had a policy of not 
promoting primary-level cadres to the district level. Because of 
this, the young cadres at the primary level have not seen any 
way to advance. At the same time, because the procedures and 
policies regarding primary-level cadres are inappropriate, the 
common tendency of cadres today is to "concentrate on engaging 
in economic activities for their families." If they participate 
in activities, they want to participate only in cooperatives and 
administrative organizations. They are very afraid of engaging 
in party and mass organization activities. 
  Besides this, at times the echo of a "new authoritarian" 
class in the rural areas has generated many concerns among the 
primary-level cadres, particularly the young cadres. 
  Also, the ideological differences among the various strata 
of 
cadres are becoming clearer and clearer, and these have led to 
unfortunate conflicts. Some older comrades think that younger 
cadres are impolite, rude to superiors, and unwilling to listen. 
Conversely, younger comrades think that older cadres are 
conservative, paternalistic, and empirical. 
  4. From various studies, we can see a number of factors that 
exert a powerful effect on the ranks of rural area cadres: 
  a. Prior to the Fifth Plenum of the Communist Party of 
Vietnam Central Committee, we had not conducted in-depth studies 
or formulated a basic and synchronized economic and social 
development strategy or strategy for building the new rural 
area. Many of the economic and social policies on rural areas 
were inappropriate and slow to be changed. We were slow to 
clarify the functions and tasks of the organizations in the 
political system at the primary level, and we were slow to 
formulate unified work regulations based on cadre positions. 
  b. There are still a number of shortcomings concerning the 
leadership and management responsibilities of the echelons 
directly superior to the primary level. They have not adhered 
closely to the ranks of primary-level cadres (monitoring things 
mainly through records and reports), and appropriate and 
effective policies and solutions have not been implemented. 
Staff and support elements have not done a good job of guiding 
and controlling the bases. 
  c. Primary-level cadre planning and training has not been 
carried on well in accord with the the positions of the cadres. 
The selection and assignment of cadres is still characterized by 
either a lack of democracy, localism, and rightist tendencies or 
an attitude of "wait and see" and "lethargy." 
  d. Many of the policies on primary-level cadres are sketchy 
and even "uneven" and irrational, but little has been done to 
overcome this situation. There are no effective regulations or 
solutions to prevent and put a stop to corruption, undemocratic 
actions, local thinking, and factionalism, which are things that 
have led to disputes and disorder in the rural areas. 
  5. Based on the present situation, in order to solve the 
above problems, in my view, efforts should be concentrated on 
clarifying and resolving the following: 
  As for organizational activities, solidifying and improving 
the party and administrative organizations, cooperatives, and 
mass organizations should be closely tied to implementing the 
programs and hitting the targets related to developing the 
economy and society and building the new rural area in accord 
with the special characteristics of each region. Based on 
regulating the assignment of the managerial and leadership 
positions of the administrative and party organizations at the 
primary level, studies should be done in order to "frame the 
responsibilities" of a number of key and primary cadre positions 
at the primary level in places where this is possible in order 
to improve the effectiveness of the apparatus. The experiences 
of Hai Hung, Thai Binh, and Ha Tay Provinces show that the 
village party committee secretary can serve concurrently as the 
chairman of the village people's council or village people's 
committee and that the party chapter secretary can serve 
concurrently as hamlet chief. 
  In my view, the lessons in establishing "hamlet 
administrative committees" in Dai Loc in Quang Nam-Danang 
Province and the "hamlet administration" form--a partial echelon 
in Thai Binh--are good lessons. The task of these units is to 
help the village people's committees manage all aspects in the 
hamlets over which the village people's committees have 
jurisdiction. They can even regulate production (the function of 
the production units). 
  As for cadre work, the echelons directly superior to the 
bases must regularly make inspections and categorize the ranks 
of key cadres by position in order to organize and arrange 
things in an appropriate manner. At the same time, cadre 
standards must gradually be formulated by position. For example, 
cadres in the delta areas must be at least level-II graduates. 
Depending on the conditions, those in the mountainous areas and 
Central Highlands can have lower standards, but cadres engaged 
in some task must definitely receive training concerning the 
responsibilities, tasks, and technical aspects of that job. At 
the same time, the cultural standards of the cadres must 
gradually be raised. 
  The system of classes and cadre training programs must be 
renovated in accord with the special characteristics of the 
rural area. These should be short-term classes that are tied to 
the positions of the cadres. Attention should be given to the 
forms used to introduce and study the good experiences at rural 
bases. 
  Cadre work, from observing and evaluating to training, 
assigning, rewarding, and disciplining cadres, must be 
democratized. Biased, narrow, and local thinking must be 
avoided. Along with perfecting the the work regulations of the 
organizations, we must continue to formulate and perfect the 
stipulations on the rights and responsibilities of all types of 
cadres based on their position. These regulations and 
stipulations must be made public in order to facilitate 
controlling and monitoring the activities of the organizations 
and cadres. 
  As for policies, village cadres are part of the ranks of 
party and state cadres in the present four-echelon party and 
administrative system. Because of this, studies should be done 
so that, if possible, the wage system can be applied in a 
suitable manner. The first thing is to unify the system of 
allowances based on position for the cadres at the primary 
level. At the same time, we must continue to examine, 
supplement, and perfect the procedures and policies regarding 
state cadres who work in rural areas for long periods, 
particularly technical cadres. 
  In summary, in expanding agriculture and developing the 
rural 
areas in our country, the primary-level cadres in the rural 
areas play a very important role. Whether our country's 
agriculture and rural areas make rapid and good progress depends 
to a great extent on the standards and strength of these cadres. 
Building and strengthening the ranks of primary-level cadres in 
the rural areas is a basis for strengthening the role and 
increasing the strength of the party.

<F P=106> [Article by Tran Huu Nghiep, M.D., teacher, member of the Ho </F>
Chi Minh City's Writers Association] 
  [Text] In the introduction to the "Human Comedy," Balzac 
wrote: "French society is the real narrator. I am just just the 
secretary who records things." I would like to ask if Vietnamese 
society today has such a secretary in such works as "Noi Buon 
Chien Tranh" [The Sorrows of War], "Ly Than," "Noi Loan" [To 
Rebel], "Bi Kich Nho" [A Small Tragedy], "Chuyen Lang Cuoi" [The 
Story of Chuoi Village], and so on. Naturally, in fictional 
literary works, imagination plays a very important role. I am 
not naive or simple-minded like the woman who looked at a 
painting by Matisse and then said: "He painted this woman with 
unequal arms." To which the famous painter responded: "You are 
greatly mistaken! This is not a woman but a painting." 
  The act of creation, how the artist subtracts or adds 
things, 
starts from the guiding idea of the artist, because each artist 
must obtain the "materials to construct" his works from real 
life. Two-hundred years ago, Goethe said that the materials used 
to create a work have things in common with the author that they 
can easily see, grasp, and write about or create. Thus, the 
plots may have something in common with the author, but that is 
not true for the majority of readers. Three centuries ago, a 
talented French writer who was a social realist, Boileau, 
commented that the best poem or the loftiest idea cannot make a 
person happy if that person's ears are damaged. 
  I think that the ears of many people were damaged when they 
read "To Rebel," "A Small Tragedy," and a number of other recent 
works even though, in the words of Goethe, they perhaps had many 
things in common with the mood of the author. In "To Rebel," the 
detailed descriptions in the rooms or beneath the waters off the 
coast of Vung Tau and the "collapse" of the degenerate writers 
in former Saigon all "salute defeat." I remember that the 
"forces to defend national culture" at that time condemned the 
immorality of a number of those works. "A Small Tragedy" is 
another immoral work. Actually, the motive resembles that of 
"Hon Vong Phu" as portrayed in several Taiwanese videos, which I 
have seen recently: Two siblings have the same father but 
different mothers. Because of historical events, they do not 
recognize each other. They fall in love and intend to marry. But 
in Taiwan, the writer did not dare allow the characters to 
engage in incest. As for the concept that the family is 
"lasting," when the young man arrives from mainland China, he is 
constantly portrayed as stupid and rustic. In "A Small Tragedy," 
Quang, an overseas Vietnamese who is now a French citizen, 
returns to his native country. He is wealthy, well-educated, and 
polite. Uncle Ca likes him very much and says: "Vietnamese 
should be polite like him. For several decades, we have been 
waging a revolution and have forgotten how to be polite. That is 
very important." (Page 36) 
  At the beginning of "A Small Tragedy," the author devotes an 
entire page to write the one sentence: "I offer my great love." 
Reading the book, I looked for the target of "my great love." 
Was it a person? The fatherland? Or a system to constantly 
improve mankind that we can respect? I had been very careless, 
because the author had clearly provided the answer on page 34 
(line 6): "If you have loved, will you encounter great love like 
Cay? That is not easy." 
  Based on the examples cited, recent short stories and novels 
in our country are filled with falsehoods. As the philosopher 
Jean Paul Sartre would say, I hope that in the coming period, 
these "falsehoods do not become beliefs" that writers want to 
transmit to readers. In my view, all writers have their own 
ideas about life. When they write something, they want to 
construct a world of man and things in order to represent those 
ideas. 
  Thus, after reading a short story or novel, I usually try to 
understand what secret ideas the author really wanted to present 
through his characters and scenes. 
  Even though I know that Vu Ngoc Phan, in his book "Modern 
Writers," has divided Vietnamese novels into ten categories and 
that the researcher Thanh Lang has organized works by their 
creative tendency (emotion, struggle, realism, humor, memoirs, 
and so on), I want to divide the works that I have read into two 
types: the constructive type that fosters confidence in people 
and the type that sows doubts in people. I would like to share 
this viewpoint with readers. 
  Unfortunately, it must be noted that recently, many short 
stories and novels of the second type have appeared on the 
market. 
  Naturally, writers will counter by saying that "my intention 
in portraying the evils in society is to help improve society." 
I don't want to waste time arguing but would simply like to cite 
an observation made by a well-known aesthetician: "Distortions 
of reality and the truth certainly follow propagating unethical 
principles and lead to nullifying what is beautiful. Even though 
this may not be the intention of the writer, refusing to portray 
social life as it is is a defense for base instincts, a 
beautification of many evils in the hottest selling 
publications, and a manifestation of what is called serving mass 
literature." (Avener Ziss, "Elements d'Esthetique Marxiste," 
Progress Publishing House, 1977, page 60] 
  This phenomenon has existed in literary circles recently. 
Without going into too much detail, I will limit my thought to 
two works, "Ke Sat Nhan Luong Thien" [The Upright Murderer] and 
"Noi Buon Chien Tranh." 
  After finishing "Ke Sat Nhan Luong Thien," I felt as if I 
had 
read a work steeped in the philosophy of "L'homme Revolte" [The 
Rebel] by Albert Camus, ideas that he wanted to convey to 
European youths following the world war. According to Camus, man 
seeks the exalted in revolt, because this is the task of the 
"present" of everyone. This is existentialism. In our society 
today, not all murderers can be viewed as upright people. Isn't 
there another way of revolting if we still believe in the system 
and place ourselves among the people of the system? In the old 
society, there may have been upright murderers. Such as Chi 
Pheo, whom Thi Mo viewed as "at times being as mild as a dove" 
but who later stabbed Ba Kien to death before killing himself. 
In the story "Ke Sat Nhan Luong Thien," the system has never 
rejected the main character's position as a human being. He has 
never suffered injustices as great as those mentioned in the 
press for so long without anything being done. Or we could ask 
any elderly cadre who left home after 23 September 1945. They 
could tell several stories about their old homes (the homes of 
their parents or homes that they purchased being leaving), which 
they have not demanded be returned to them. Instead, with 
confidence in the system that they helped build with their sweat 
and blood, their "revolt" has followed a different course. No 
one has become a murderer. Instead, various medals are pinned on 
their chests. 
  I would also like to say something about "Noi Buon Chien 
Tranh." The great emotions that the author wanted to portray are 
contained in the final section. Absurdly, "during the 
Vietnamese-American war, people shared the same fate with ups 
and downs, victories and defeats, happiness and suffering, death 
and life." (page 281) 
  After finishing the book, I thought about a number of the 
works of the great existentialist Jean Paul Sartre and his 
arguments about the "nausea" of human existence. 
  The materialistic philosophers of Marxism-Leninism have 
commented a lot on existentialism. Here, I will simply quote 
Jules Romains, a very progressive writer: "In taking up arms in 
war, no one can say that he is a victim or that he is naive or 
uninvolved." Thus, people must think hard before deciding 
whether to desert or enlist. Desertion? The person will lose 
honor among people of his own generation and others in his 
native village, and he may even lose his loved ones. Thus, he 
must elect to "enlist," hoping for the day there is peace. After 
the war, desires may not be fulfilled or they may be fulfilled 
only partly. Thus, there is sadness. 
  As a doctor, I have had a chance to attend the "inventories 
of individual assets" of many northern youths who went to B and 
later died of malaria or hematuria. I have read the very private 
diaries of a number of these people before the diaries were 
turned over to their unit before being returned to the family. I 
can assure you that none of these diaries contained any thoughts 
about "the sorrows of war." 
  Meeting a number of cadres who were wearing military 
uniforms 
and handling B-52 bombs in the forests, I asked them their 
feelings about past events. All of their views can be summarized 
by a poem by the French poet Alfred de Vigny, who wrote a poem 
in praise of the heroism of those who fight and make sacrifices 
in self-defense: "Signs, tears, and cries for mercy are all 
insignificant." Or as Goethe wrote: "If the suffering enables us 
to gain happiness, what does the suffering matter?" 
  Someone will surely ask: How much does happiness cost? My 
response is, We have already discarded two layers of "rock" that 
pressed the heart and mind of Phan Boi Chau his entire life. 
Those are the disgrace of losing the country and the nation's 
poverty in the eyes of the world. We have replaced that with the 
rose of wonderful hopes for the future of the country and men of 
humanism. 
  Are there negative aspects in society today? Of course there 
are. President Ho said: "There is nothing more precious than 
independence and freedom." But because they were slaves for so 
long, many people are not yet awake enough to realize that they 
are the masters of their homeland and that they are free. I 
would like to use the title of one of the novels by Albert 
Camus. People mistakenly view themselves as "the stranger" in 
their own land. 
  Our party knows that freeing mankind from unjust oppression, 
poverty, backwardness, and corruption is very difficult. Thus, 
it has called for a resolute struggle by all people. I think 
that writers, more than anyone, should be aware of this.

  [Text] The central council that is guiding the preparation 
of national instructional materials for courses in 
Marxist-Leninist theory and Ho Chi Minh thought held a symposium 
on "Marxism-Leninism and Our Era" in Hanoi on 14-16 October 
1993. The purpose of the symposium was: 
  To affirm our attitudes and positions on Marxism-Leninism 
and 
Ho Chi Minh thought, with this regarded as our ideological 
foundation and compass for action. To clarify the theoretical 
and practical basis of this affirmation. 
  To defend and develop Marxism-Leninism, oppose plots to 
eliminate Marxism-Leninism and socialism in conditions in which 
the world is undergoing many changes and in which the country is 
facing great difficulties and challenges. 
  To exchange opinions on a number of the most common and 
important issues of Marxism-Leninism that are related to the 
topics, and to create a unified basis for preparing the 
instructional materials. 
  Almost 100 people attended the symposium. Dao Duy Tung, a 
member of the Politburo and Standing Committee of the 
Secretariat and council president, and Nguyen Duc Binh, a member 
of the Politburo, director of the Ho Chi Minh Institute of 
National Politics, and vice president of the council, attended 
and presided at the symposium along with council standing 
committee members Nguyen Dinh Tu, the secretary of the Communist 
Party of Vietnam [CPV] Central Committee and head of the 
Department of Science and Education of the Central Committee, 
Dang Xuan Ky, a member of the CPV Central Committee and head of 
the Marxist-Leninist and Ho Chi Minh Thought Research Institute, 
and Nguyen Duy Quy, a member of the CPV Central Committee and 
director of the National Social Sciences and Humanities Center. 
The council members, the chairmen, vice chairmen, secretaries, 
and members of the five instructional materials preparation 
committees and secretariat, and a number of full-time cadres who 
are monitoring the KX-10 program attended, too. 
  Dao Duy Tung, who gave the opening speech, stated the goals 
and requirements of the symposium and, at the same time, pointed 
out the discussion format. He called on the scientists to go to 
the heart of the issues raised and discuss things with a 
democratic and scientific spirit and a lofty sense of 
responsibility. 
  Professor Dang Xuan Ky, in his introductory remarks, raised 
a 
number of theoretical and practical issues of Marxism-Leninism 
and methodological issues in understanding, developing, and 
defending Marxism-Leninism today. 
  The scientists attending the symposium discussed things very 
vigorously. Many of the ideas manifested new approaches with 
independent and creative ways of thinking. There were 41 
speeches. Many people spoke two or three times and frankly 
debated specific issues. The symposium revolved around five main 
issues: 
  1. Correctly understanding Marxism-Leninism and issues 
concerning methodology: 
  Those at the symposium analyzed the essential points in 
great 
depth in order to correctly understand the basic theoretical 
contents of Marxism-Leninism. Based on this, they unanimously 
affirmed the great role of Marxism-Leninism in our era. Even 
though socialism has now collapsed in many countries, 
Marxism-Leninism is still our banner and a compass for our 
actions. The collapse of socialism in the Soviet Union and 
Eastern Europe is not synonymous with the collapse of 
Marxism-Leninism. Grasping the revolutionary and scientific 
nature of Marxism-Leninism and making creative use of this in 
our country's specific conditions is the basic guideline in our 
ideological and theoretical work. 
  However, to understand Marxism-Leninism correctly, we must 
distinguish between what Marx, Engels, and Lenin said from the 
erroneous things that others have said in explaining their 
theory, which has transformed their theory. The arguments of 
Marx, Engels, and Lenin must be placed within the specific 
historical conditions of the time in which they advanced their 
arguments. This is the only way to correctly understand the 
issues posed by these men. Their arguments must be placed within 
the framework of a system; they cannot be separated. At the same 
time, they must be understood under the new light of the present 
age. 
  2. The essence and nature of the age: 
  There have long been many different views on this issue. 
Some 
people say that the present age is still a period of transition 
from capitalism to socialism on a worldwide scope, with this 
starting with the Russian October Revolution. This is true even 
though socialism as an international system with the Soviet 
Union as its pillar no longer exists. Others agree that the 
present age is a period of transition from capitalism to 
socialism on a worldwide scope, but they say that this must be 
explained more concretely in accord with the changes in the 
present situation. Specifically, attention must be given to: a. 
the influence of the scientific and technical revolution; b. 
capitalism has the potential to grow thanks to many factors 
(even though the basic conflicts of capitalism are becoming 
sharper and sharper; c. the rise of more than 100 newly 
independent countries; d. the appearance of urgent universal 
problems that are related to the fate of mankind; e. and the 
collapse of the international socialist system. Many people 
think that the present age must be defined in accord with the 
real situation and in accord with the scientific and technical 
revolution, which is having a great influence on social 
progress. This revolution has created an all-around crisis for 
both socialism and capitalism. Mankind is facing urgent problems 
that everyone must help to solve if we are to survive. 
  Through discussion and debate, those at the symposium said 
that even though realistic socialism in the Soviet Union and 
Eastern Europe has collapsed, the present age is still a period 
of transition from capitalism to socialism on a worldwide scope. 
This is an objective reality and the direction of movement and 
development of history. However, the manner of expression must 
be balanced. 
  3. On the theory of "economic and social structure": 
  Many people affirmed Marx' analysis concerning the evolution 
of man through economic and social structures, which holds that 
this started from historical materialism. This provides a firm 
basis for viewing the development of economic and social 
structures as a natural historical process. Some people said 
that this theory is correct, but that it needs to be 
supplemented, because when the theory was first formulated, Marx 
analyzed mainly Greek, Roman, and Western European societies. He 
was not able to study Asia or other places. The universal nature 
of this theory must be clarified. The analysis can also be 
supplemented by civilization. But if this approach based on 
civilization is made absolute and this leads to a rejection of 
the economic and social theory of Marx, that would be a mistake. 
Marx' theory on economic and social structures is correct. It is 
still the "foundation stone" of historical materialism. It 
reflects the laws of development of human society and is the 
methodological basis for examining specific historical 
viewpoints. 
  4. The historical significance of the theory of surplus 
value 
and the nature of modern capitalism: 
  Many people affirmed that Marx' theory of surplus value is 
still the foundation of his economic theory. This is still the 
basis for analyzing the changes in modern capitalist society. 
Others said that the theory of surplus value is of epochal 
significance and that it is still the basis for analyzing and 
understanding modern capitalism. However, Marx' arguments on the 
absolute impoverishment of the proletariat were correct only 
during during the time of free-competition capitalism. Today, 
there is only relative impoverishment. The theory of surplus 
value was correct only during the age of "industrial" 
capitalism. Now, in the period of "post-industrial" capitalism, 
this theory is no longer correct. Today, capitalism produces 
wealth not by exploiting the surplus value of the workers but by 
using modern techniques and technology (robots). Capitalism is 
accumulating many socialist factors, which is making capitalism 
more "humane." 
  Through discussing and debating the above ideas, those at 
the 
symposium affirmed that Marx' theory of surplus value still 
maintains its original value. Because in the final analysis, 
only with live laborers can surplus value be created. As for 
modern capitalism, the following must be clearly recognized: the 
effects of the scientific and technical revolution, the new 
development standards of the production forces, the new forms of 
production relationships in capitalism, and the fact that the 
working class in the capitalist countries has undergone a 
structural change (the middle class has expanded). 
  5. The historical mission of the working class: 
  It was affirmed that socialism will replace capitalism and 
that it is the working class that has this historical mission. 
But when talking about the historical mission of the working 
class, it must be understood that the concept "working class" 
includes those who have a working class consciousness and 
position. Reality shows that the great majority of the leaders 
of the working class are intellectuals with a working class 
consciousness and position. Some people criticized the view that 
the working class no longer has a historical mission as the 
representative of the new production formulas. That role now 
belongs to the intellectuals. 
  Those at the symposium analyzed the above ideas in great 
depth and unanimously agreed that even though capitalism has 
made changes and even though the structure of the working class 
has changed, the historical mission of the working class has not 
changed. Today, just as in the past, the working class is still 
being exploited by the capitalist class both intellectually and 
physically. The working class still represents modern 
production. Its historical mission is still to eliminate the 
yoke of capitalist exploitation and transform capitalist society 
into a more progressive and humane socialist society. Only with 
the working class will liberating the working class be viewed as 
tied to liberating all of society. 
  Concluding the symposium, on behalf of the council and the 
presiding officials at the symposium, Professor Nguyen Duc Binh 
evaluated the results of the 3-day symposium and mentioned the 
tasks that must be done following the symposium. He stressed 
that we agree on many of the problems but that we must continue 
to study and debate things. As for those issues on which there 
is a lack of agreement, the committees must continue to study 
things and organize discussions and debates. The council will 
reach conclusions in order to have a scientific basis for 
preparing high-quality instructional materials and satisfying 
the requirements in studying and teaching Marxism-Leninism and 
Ho Chi Minh thought in our country today.

History] 
  [Text] In Vietnam, does the market economy require the 
party's leadership? 
  Today, some people are asking: Now that we have switched to 
a 
market economy, that is, an economy that operates based on the 
laws of value, supply and demand, and competition, why do we 
need the leadership of the party? They say that on many 
occasions, party leadership has hindered and interfered with the 
operation of the economy. In many places, the party 
organizations are falling apart but the economy has managed to 
hold its own and even expand well. 
  Those with such ideas look at just one aspect of the 
problem, 
and more importantly, they do not understand the nature and 
contents of building a market economy in our country. 
  As we all known, the party advocates expanding the market 
economy (in place of a state-subsidies economy involving 
bureaucratic centralism type control), but this is not an 
undisciplined market economy but a state-controlled market 
economy with a socialist orientation. That is, it is an economy 
whose real purpose is to foster a "wealthy people, strong state, 
and fair and civilized society." In the past, there were times 
when we did not correctly understand the meaning of a market 
economy, and a market economy was thought of as being synonymous 
with capitalism and incompatible with socialism. But reality has 
helped us to gradually understand that a market economy is not 
completely synonymous with capitalism and that switching to a 
market economy does not necessarily mean that you are following 
the capitalist path. Socialism must develop a commodity economy 
and apply market mechanisms. However, for socialism, a market 
economy is not everything but just a formula and measure for 
expanding the production forces. Expanding the production forces 
must go hand in hand with building suitable production 
relationships and building good relationships between people and 
a prosperous, compassionate, and kind society. 
  Today, there are various theoretical issues that we must 
continue to study in depth. Only based on reviewing the 
realities can we gradually improve and clarify things. But 
concerning the basic points, it can be said that a 
socialist-oriented market economy differs from a capitalist 
market economy in the following ways: 
  The ownership system: Under capitalism, the foundation is 
private capitalist ownership. But in our country today, we are 
varying the forms of ownership based on a system of public 
ownership of the main means of production. 
  Economic elements: Under capitalism, there are many forms 
(including a state economy, joint enterprises, state capitalism, 
and so on) that are controlled by the bourgeois state and 
directed by private capitalists. In Vietnam today, there are 
many forms, too, but they are controlled by the socialist 
state--meaning a state that is truly of the people, by the 
people, and for the people--and the state and collective 
economies are playing a greater and greater pivotal role and 
directing things. 
  The management system: Under capitalism, the markets are 
characterized by spontaneous and free competition. Even though 
the state regulates things, intervenes, and formulates plans, 
this is not the basic tendency. In our country today, while 
steps must be taken to stimulate and create the conditions for 
exploiting the positive role of the market mechanism, there must 
also be strong and positive intervention by the state (through 
plans, policies, laws, and economic strength) in order to 
regulate and guide things and limit the negative aspects of the 
market mechanism. 
  The distribution system: Under capitalism, distribution is 
based primarily on capital and serves the interests of the 
capitalists. In our country today, we are using many forms of 
distribution, primarily distribution based on labor and economic 
results. We are both encouraging the laborers and providing 
basic social welfare services. 
  Social policy: Capitalism came into being by initially 
accumulating things through plundering. Because of this, it "has 
much blood on its hands." Today, the capitalist countries have 
made some changes, but because of its nature, capitalism cannot 
resolve the basic conflicts, do away with the cruel exploitation 
of laborers, narrow the gap between rich and poor, or end the 
cruel injustices. In our country today, while the market economy 
is expanding, exploitation must be limited and economic growth 
must be tied to social fairness. Also, encouraging people to 
become wealthy legally must be tied to eliminating poverty. From 
the very beginning when the economy is not highly developed, 
attention must be given to social policies and to maintaining 
the morals and color of the national culture. 
  In summary, we advocate expanding the market economy, but it 
must not be allowed to operate spontaneously and blindly. 
Instead, it must be led, guided, and regulated. The positive 
aspects must be exploited, and the negative aspects must be 
limited for the interests of the majority of the laboring people 
and for a just and civilized society. The entity with the 
ability to do this is none other than than the communist party, 
a party that struggles for socialist and communist ideals and 
that really represents and protects the interests of the working 
class and laboring people. The leadership of the party is the 
decisive factor in maintaining a socialist orientation for our 
market economy and the entire development of our country. 
  Recently, some people were very happy when Vietnam switched 
to expanding a market economy, but they hoped that that would be 
a "free, privatized market economy," that is, a capitalist 
market economy. People have done everything they can to push us 
into the capitalist orbit. They think that by encouraging 
Vietnam to have a "market economy," the economy will determine 
politics and that changing the economic system will lead to 
changes in the political system. On one hand, they praise a 
market economy, and on the other hand, they actively criticize 
and reject the leadership of the communist party. Enemy forces 
are implementing "peaceful changes" and trying to attack the 
leadership of the communist party with the aim of doing away 
with the socialist orientation of our market economy and 
eventually eliminating socialism. In Vietnam and among a number 
of Vietnamese living abroad, some people have openly demanded 
that the Communist Party of Vietnam abandon its leadership role. 
The realities in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe show that 
once the communist party collapses, socialism will disappear and 
the economy will not have a socialist orientation. The Western 
capitalist countries are very pleased by this. They are doing 
everything possible to foster this tendency. Unfortunately, 
among our ranks, a number of people are vacillating, and they 
have been fooled by these tricks. 
<H5>  Why is there just one leading party here? </H5>
  Some people have argued that a market economy is a 
multi-faceted economy. Each element corresponds to a particular 
class or stratum and each class or stratum has a corresponding 
party or political organization. Thus, in Vietnam, why do we 
advocate having just one leading party? Having a multi-faceted 
economy but just one leading party is a "contradiction," a 
"paradox." They have demanded that we implement political 
pluralism and eliminate one-party leadership. According to them, 
this is the only way to bring about democracy. 
  First of all, it must be noted that we have not just said 
"oppose party pluralism." Because there are many things about 
pluralism, understood in its broadest and fullest sense, that 
must be opposed and avoided. We are varying the ownership forms 
and forms of distribution and pluralizing foreign relations. We 
advocate developing a multi-faceted economy and having 
multi-faceted information. Our country has had many parties. If 
the parties have the same goal and focus on the same basic 
interests (for example, the communist party, the democrat party, 
and the socialist party all survived in our country for a long 
time) and they accept the leadership of the communist party, 
there is nothing to reject. But we cannot accept political 
pluralism and opposition parties. That is, we cannot accept 
opposition organizations and factional tendencies that would 
destroy the unity of the party and the revolution of the people. 
  We have not used the word "oppose." Because in each country, 
the situation at any given time is different, and the level of 
democracy and specific conditions are different. There may be 
countries that need to use a "pluralistic" and "multi-party" 
system. That is the internal affair of each country. 
  What we have said is that Vietnam does not have the 
objective 
conditions to accept political pluralism and opposition parties. 
This is because the political situation, socioeconomic 
standards, people's standard of culture, and laws in our country 
do not permit this. The war here ended just recently. Our 
country needs political stability, solidarity, and unity in 
order to build and expand the economy. The enemy forces are 
watching, implementing a policy of encirclement, and trying to 
destroy the just cause of our people. Within the country, there 
are reactionary elements who were punished by the revolution. If 
we accept political pluralism and opposition parties, that would 
be tantamount to enabling these reactionary forces to rise up 
and legally carry on activities opposing the fatherland, the 
people, and the system. That is something that the people 
certainly cannot accept. 
  In recent interviews and speeches in the United States, even 
Nguyen Cao Ky, a strong anti-communist who once served as the 
premier of the Republic of Vietnam, said that "if a poor and 
backward country like Vietnam follows the American model of 
democracy in all respects, that will just lead to disorder, 
smuggling, and prostitution." He said that 30-40 years ago, 
Taiwan, Korea, and Singapore "arose from a single-party system," 
and they "did not tolerate opposition." The main purpose of such 
a system was to enable them to create political and social 
stability and create the necessary preconditions for developing 
a market economy. Those countries have "succeeded brilliantly 
and built a strong economy." "They have become democratic and 
progressive countries that serve as a model for underdeveloped, 
third-world countries." [Footnote 1] [See TIME, 7, 8 November 
1992 and VIETNAM, 7 November 1992] 
  Reality shows that in countries that have implemented 
political pluralism and that have allowed opposition parties, 
there is often instability or there may be coups. A number of 
people who have studied international political systems have 
summarized and revealed figures proving that of the 23 countries 
that have a one-party system, 19 are stable countries and 4 are 
relatively stable. None were unstable. Of the 26 countries that 
had a multi-party system, 11 were stable, 2 were relatively 
stable, and 13 were unstable. In a number of Eastern European 
countries and the former Soviet Union, after they implemented 
political pluralism and permitted opposition parties, there was 
great turmoil and bloody warfare. These countries experienced a 
serious economic crisis and were unable to develop, and the 
standard of living of the people declined. 
  Recently, some people have said that not implementing "party 
pluralism" is undemocratic and that the level of democracy of a 
country is manifested by the existence of many parties. In my 
view, such a view is incorrect. The existence of many parties is 
not an index of whether a society is or is not democratic or how 
democratic it is. South Vietnamese society during the 
American-Diem period had many parties such as the Can Lao, Nhan 
Vi, Duy Linh, and Democrat parties, and there were hundreds of 
political and social organizations. But it cannot be said that 
that society was democratic, and it cannot be said that that 
society was more democratic than the present society. In my 
view, the democratic character and level of a country and 
society are determined primarily by the degree to which the 
ownership rights of the majority of the people are manifested 
and the degree to which the interests and will of the majority 
of people (meaning the laboring people) are implemented in 
society. Democracy is a manifestation and implementation of the 
ownership rights of the people. The administration is in the 
hands of the laboring people, and it defends and serves the 
interests of the laboring people and exploits the intelligence, 
energy, and creativity of the people. Democracy has nothing to 
do with how many parties there are. 
  We are switching to a multi-faceted economy, but as 
mentioned 
above, this is a socialist-oriented multi-faceted economy that 
is controlled and regulated by the state. Because of this, just 
because there are many economic elements, there doesn't have to 
be many opposing classes and many political parties. 
  The "many party" arguments of the anti-communist forces are 
actually aimed at reducing or eliminating the leadership of the 
communist party, creating turmoil and disorder in the country, 
and toppling the regime. That is their only objective. People 
have spread rumors and demanded "democracy," "pluralism," "many 
parties," and "human rights" as a front for implementing their 
insidious plot of creating turmoil and destroying things from 
within. 
  Moreover, do those countries and people who are calling for 
"pluralism and many parties" really accept those organizations 
and forces that oppose them? Why do they advocate killing 
communist leaders, annihilating those who oppose them, and 
suppressing movements opposing the regime? Before they seize 
power, people praise "democracy," "pluralism," and "many 
parties," but after they have seized power and eliminated the 
leadership of the communist party, they immediately ban 
activities by the communist party, place communism outside the 
law, demand that the assets of the party be nationalized, close 
the offices of the party, burn down the offices of the party 
central committee, and look for ways to take revenge on and 
eliminate communist party members. Why is this? After they seize 
power, they no longer talk about "pluralism and many parties." 
  The Communist Party of Vietnam has never imposed its 
monopolistic leadership role. To have the people recognize it as 
the leader, the party has undergone a long and difficult 
struggle filled with challenges and sacrifices. Hundreds of 
thousands of outstanding people of the party and nation have 
fallen. Establishing the leadership of the party is the fruit of 
the revolutionary struggle waged by the working class and the 
entire Vietnamese nation. Although there have been times when 
the party made mistakes, because it promptly admitted and 
corrected its shortcomings, the party still has the trust of 
most people. To date, no one can refute the leadership role of 
the Communist Party of Vietnam, and there is no other political 
force besides the Communist Party of Vietnam with the 
capabilities and conditions to lead the Vietnamese revolution. 
Only the imperialists and reactionaries are slandering the party 
and trying to reduce its prestige and eliminate its leadership 
role. Only a dolt would reject the revolutionary achievements 
scored by his people and want to create opposition parties, 
thinking that that is democratic freedom. 
<H3>  The leadership contents and methods of the party in a market 
economy: </H3>
  As the only party with the power to lead all of society in 
market economy conditions, the Communist Party of Vietnam 
clearly recognizes its responsibilities to the country and 
people and the honor given it. The party is responsible for 
correctly determining the direction, targets, and path of the 
country, and it is responsible for the prosperity of the nation. 
It leads the entire political system and social apparatus, above 
all the state and organizations, in hitting the targets and 
fulfilling the tasks pointed out, leads the systematization and 
promulgation of party resolutions as laws, designs the 
apparatus, trains and assigns cadres, controls and trains cadres 
to support carrying out the political tasks, controls the 
implementation of the party's policies and lines, reviews 
practices, and revises and perfects the lines and policies. 
Everything is aimed at maintaining a correct political character 
and orientation on the country's path forward and on the 
nation's path of development. 
  In the economic sphere, the party points out economic 
development lines and strategies, ensures the political 
character in the development of the economy, enables the economy 
to grow at a rapid pace, have high labor productivity, and have 
larger and larger production forces in line with a socialist 
orientation, limits injustices and exploitation, and looks after 
and protects the interests of the laboring people. This is 
manifested not only at the central echelon and in the 
macrocosmic leadership and management activities but also in 
each party cell. Every party base and every cadre and party 
member is responsible for ensuring that the party's political 
guidelines are understood thoroughly in all economic and social 
activities. These are functions that no one but the party can 
carry out. 
  The leading tasks of the party committee echelons are to 
lead 
and control things and directly struggle to implement the 
policies and lines of the party effectively and to ensure that 
all the economic elements follow the socialist guidelines and do 
not slip out of the socialist orbit. The party committee 
echelons, party chapters, and party members at the state 
enterprises, collective economic units, and joint and private 
enterprises are responsible for leading the masses and mass 
organizations in striving to put the party's resolutions into 
life, struggling to implement the stipulations of the party and 
the laws of the state, protecting the legitimate rights and 
interests of the workers and laborers, opposing barbaric acts of 
exploitation, and opposing beating laborers or treating them 
harshly. 
  Naturally, in today's conditions, the party cannot lead and 
operate using the old formulas. The party must maintain its 
leadership role. It cannot relax or reduce its leadership role. 
At the same time, it must exploit the role of the administrative 
organizations, economic organizations, and mass organizations. A 
distinction must be made between the leadership of the party and 
the management of the administrative organizations and between 
administrative management and management of commercial 
production. The party committee echelons must not become overly 
involved in or perform the daily management functions of the 
administration or economic organizations. The party provides 
concrete and close leadership but it must not become involved in 
carrying out things and giving orders. It must lead through the 
party members and party organizations. Party members who are 
assigned to state organizations and economic organizations must 
act in accord with the program and line of the party and 
implement the principle of democratic centralism. The party's 
organizational system must be solidified and streamlined, and it 
must provide clear, quick, and dynamic leadership in accord with 
the market mechanism. The party must lead using democratic 
methods and persuasion. The cadres and party members must set an 
example in implementing the resolutions of the party and the 
laws of the state, and they must regularly mobilize and persuade 
people outside the party. The party organizations must renovate 
their activities and operations to make them more dynamic, 
reduce the number of unnecessary meetings, strengthen 
on-the-spot control and guidance, and monitor the bases closely. 
  The basic and decisive conditions for ensuring that the 
party 
provides good and effective leadership are that the party must 
be really pure and strong politically, ideologically, and 
organizationally, and it must be very close to the people and 
have the trust and support of the people. In the present 
situation, the party must have strong political capabilities, 
adhere firmly to the targets and ideals, have intelligence and 
knowledge, have adequate information, and have the ability to 
handle complex problems promptly and correctly. 
  The party must build a tight organizational system with a 
small but strong apparatus, including a system of law-governed 
state organizations and mass organizations. 
  The party must have excellent and loyal staff organizations 
to help do the work. These must have the ability to analyze and 
integrate things, propose solutions, and control and evaluate 
projects. 
  The party must build a rank of loyal and devoted cadres and 
party members who have good moral qualities and leadership and 
managerial capabilities, who are knowledgeable about and can 
manage the economy, who are knowledgeable about the law and can 
manage the state using the laws, and who can adjust to markets 
quickly and enthusiastically. 
  All cadres and party members must give attention to 
improving 
their political quality, adhere to the guidelines and paths 
decided on, improve their intellectual standards and work 
capabilities, study regularly, improve their revolutionary 
ethics, live a wholesome life, and strive to eliminate 
corruption and other degenerate phenomena within the party. Only 
by resolutely removing the tumors in its own body (regardless of 
how painful this is) can the party develop in a wholesome and 
vigorous manner. 
  Once the party is strong and robust, has internal 
solidarity, 
unity and tight discipline, and has the trust and support of the 
people, there will not be any obstacle that the party can't 
overcome or anything that the party can't do.

<F P=106> [Article by Nguyen Van Rop, Tay Ninh Province CPV secretary] </F>
  [Text] Tay Ninh Province has a very important position in 
the southwestern part of the fatherland and in eastern Nam Bo. 
It served as a revolutionary base during the periods of 
resistance. Thus, during the war, Tay Ninh was an area where the 
enemy frequently launched attacks and sweeps. The material base 
and infrastructure, which were weak to begin with, suffered 
great damage. After the south was completely liberated, Tay Ninh 
had to cope with the border war started by the Khmer Rouge. Tay 
Ninh really started rebuilding only at the beginning of the 
1980s. 
  Tay Ninh's border with Cambodia runs for 240 km. Recently 
along the border, there have frequently been cases of smuggling, 
encroachments on the land, armed robberies, and disturbances. 
Many overseas Vietnamese living in Cambodia have been terrorized 
by the Khmer Rouge and have had to take refuge here, which has 
made the situation even more tense and complex. 
  There are many religious groups in Tay Ninh Province, and 
this is where the Vatican, or "capital" of the Cao Dai religion 
is located. The followers of the Cao Dai religion make up more 
than 30 percent of the province's population. The 
counterrevolutionaries and bad elements frequently make use of 
the Cao Dai religion, disguise themselves as religious 
followers, and plot to destroy the revolutionary regime. 
  This situation and these special characteristics mean that 
we 
must regularly solidify and build the party and revolutionary 
forces, maintain political security, order, and social safety, 
and stabilize and develop the economy and society. After the 
seventh party congress and the fifth congress of the provincial 
party organization, Tay Ninh made many positive changes, but 
there are still a number of shortcomings and weaknesses. The 
most striking thing is that some cadres and party members are 
wavering with respect to their ideological position, their 
confidence and combat will power has declined, their quality has 
declined, their way of life has become degenerate, they have 
become remote from the masses, and they violate party discipline 
and the laws of the state. From 1989 to November 1992, a total 
of 1,304 party members committed disciplinary violations. Among 
these were committee chairmen and vice chairmen and sector heads 
in the province, members of district Communist Party of Vietnam 
standing committees, and members of party committees directly 
subordinate to the province. 
  Although the apparatus has been solidified somewhat, it is 
still not strong enough, particularly at the base, village, and 
subward echelons and in the economic units. The staff committees 
of the party committee echelons are generally weak. The district 
echelon is both weak and unstable. As of September 1992, 11.59 
percent of the party bases in the province were weak. In the 
border villages, 15.78 percent of the party bases were weak, and 
10.4 percent of the hamlets did not have any party members on 
the spot. Only 7.3 percent of the party members came from 
religious families. 
  Cadres are not selected, trained, assigned, or used 
rationally. A number of sectors lack key cadres and cadres with 
technical capabilities. As of September 1992, 18.99 percent of 
the key cadres at the primary, district, and city levels had 
only a level-I cultural standard; 86 percent of the cadres who 
lead and manage sectors in the province, districts, and cities 
had not attended advanced schools or college. For many reasons, 
many cadres at the primary level lack enthusiasm and are not at 
ease in their work. 
  Because of the lack of work regulations or because people do 
not follow the regulations, in many places the relationship 
between the party committee echelons and the people's councils 
and between the party committees and the authorities and mass 
organizations are "skewed" and they "overlap each other." At the 
same time, a number of spheres lack party leadership. 
  After the resolution of the Third Plenum of the CPV Central 
Committee was issued, we made an effort to continue renovating 
and reorganizing the party and overcome the shortcoming and 
weaknesses. We organized things to implement the resolution of 
the third plenum and viewed this as an important step in 
establishing order in order to implement the party's 
resolutions. After accepting the resolution at the central 
echelon, the standing committee of the provincial CPV committee 
organized things to study and thoroughly understand the 
resolution and immediately formulated an action program. After 
that, we organized meetings for the key cadres from the 
provincial to the primary echelons to help them thoroughly 
understand the resolution of the central echelon and the action 
program of the province. Based on that, the district, city, and 
primary-level party committees formulated their own action 
programs. 
  The striking points in understanding the resolutions and 
formulating action programs this time are: Implementing the 
party resolutions has been tied to carrying out the political 
tasks and solving the pressing economic and social problems of 
the localities. We view economic development as the central 
task. Party construction is a key task, and security and 
national defense work is an important and regular task. The 
decisive element is organization-cadre work. 
  The party committee echelons are giving much attention to 
formulating action programs. The provincial guidance committee 
has directly contributed ideas to the action programs of the 
districts, and party committees directly subordinate to the 
province and bases have been chosen to serve as test points. In 
providing guidance, the standing committee of the provincial 
party committee has given much attention to ensuring that cadres 
outside the party and the masses thoroughly understand the 
resolution. As of March 1993, the resolution had been 
disseminated to 135,268 people (approximately 16 percent of the 
population). 
  In order to provide close and timely guidance, the 
provincial 
CPV committee has established a committee to guide disseminating 
the resolutions. This committee consists of a number of members 
of the standing committee of the provincial CPV committee, and 
it is chaired by the deputy secretary of the standing committee. 
We have also established work teams consisting of talented 
cadres from the party committees in order to directly help, 
guide, and monitor the target districts and bases. In the 
districts and cities, the party committees directly subordinate 
to the province are carrying on similar activities. As for 
military party committees, we have not established guidance 
committees. Instead, the standing committee of the provincial 
military party committee is providing direct guidance. Besides 
this, the provincial CPV committee and the party committee 
echelons directly subordinate to the province have assigned 
party committee members at each echelon the task of monitoring 
and guiding a particular base. Today, at 127 of the 425 party 
bases, provincial or district party committee members are 
monitoring and guiding the implementation of the resolution of 
the Third Plenum of the CPV Central Committee. 
  As for selecting guidance points, the province has selected 
one border district (Ben Cau District), one inner district (Hao 
Thanh District, where 98 percent of the people are followers of 
the Cao Dai faith), one border village, one inner village, a 
party chapter of the provincial people's organ of control, a 
party chapter of the Sugar Cane Corporation, and a party 
organization in the Tax Department. The party organizations 
directly subordinate to the province have also selected 31 bases 
to serve as test points. 
  After carrying out the resolution of the Third Plenum of the 
CPV Central Committee for more than a year, although there are 
still many limitations, we have achieved a number of results: 
  The majority of party members, cadres outside the party, and 
masses see the urgent requirements and have grasped the basic 
contents of renovating and reorganizing the party. Most party 
members and people agree with the decrees of the central echelon 
and regard renovating and reorganizing the party as a 
particularly important and urgent task that is decisive for 
building and defending the country and that is decisive with 
respect to the fate of the party. With this understanding, the 
party members and masses have actively participated in the work 
of the party. The sense of responsibility of most party members 
has been elevated, and their party concepts have been improved. 
This is a major and fundamental achievement that has long-term 
significance. Without this great response and participation, the 
party committee echelons would not be able to achieve good 
results in building the party. 
  Because of having integrated plans and good organization, 
many places have solved various problems and made new changes. 
The party committee echelons have grasped the real state of 
affairs of the cadres and party members and the strengths and 
weaknesses of each party base. Thus, when engaging in 
self-criticism and criticism in accord with Directive 14-CT/TW 
of the Secretariat of the CPV Central Committee, they have dealt 
promptly with a number of party committee echelon members and 
party members who had long been committing violations. They have 
assigned tasks to party members who had not assigned tasks 
previously. There is a closeness between retired party members 
and party members now holding positions, and they are 
coordinating things, which is helping to strengthen the party 
bases. The changes in understanding have led to changes in 
action. Many people have confidence in the party and want to 
join. During the first six months of 1992, the province 
recruited 191 party members, and during the first six months of 
1993 it recruited 234 party members. A number of "white hamlets" 
have been eliminated, and primary-level administration and 
primary-level organizations have been solidified somewhat. 
  The party bases have begun to be solidified and reorganized 
(29 bases have been disbanded, and 22 new bases have been 
established). All of the bases have action programs. These 
action programs have been thoroughly reviewed by higher 
echelons, and the masses have contributed ideas to them. Because 
of this, they are both practical and suitable, and this has 
improved the quality of the activities of the party bases. More 
than 93 percent of the various-echelon party committees have 
completed making reviews and begun making good changes on many 
fronts. Almost all of the party committees directly subordinate 
to the province have expanded on the decisions of the Politburo 
and Secretariat of the CPV Central Committee and the guidelines 
of the Organization Department of the provincial CPV committee 
on the functions, tasks, and work regulations of the various 
types of party bases and on the requirements and contents in 
examining strong party bases. 
  The party committee echelons have given special attention to 
transforming cadre work, from renovating viewpoints on 
evaluating and training cadres to renovating the procedures and 
policies on compensating cadres. Based on examining and 
evaluating the cadres, the party committee echelons have 
formulated plans to train nearby cadres. The standing committee 
of the provincial CPV committee has guided those in charge of 
the blocks, committees, sectors, districts, cities, and party 
committees directly subordinate to the province in grasping the 
real situation and evaluating the key cadres who hold position, 
cadres in line, and cadres with aspirations in order to examine 
the entire system and formulate plans to fundamentally rearrange 
and reorganize things. 
  Never before has Tay Ninh Province had such theoretical, 
political, and technical training campaigns. Besides sending 
cadres to train at schools and to attend classes at the central 
echelon and at the zone, the province is also opening advanced 
on-the-job theoretical and political classes. The provincial 
party school has opened seven middle-level theoretical and 
political classes in the province and in the districts. Among 
these is one for scientific and technical cadres who are not 
party members. Besides this, many cadres have been sent to 
attend regular and on-the-job technical and professional classes 
at colleges and on-the-job training centers. 
  Although the budget is still limited, the province has 
decided to temporarily provide allowances to primary-level 
cadres based on a fixed number. Specifically, the maximum number 
for each village and subward is 33, including: party block, 4; 
organizations, 10 (youth union: 2; Veterans Association: 1; Red 
Cross: 1); people's council, 1; people's committee, 3; and 
technical sectors, 15. Each hamlet has also been allotted two 
for the party chapter secretary and the head of the hamlet 
management board. The allowance system is being carried out in a 
unified manner: The village and subward secretaries and chairmen 
receive an allowance equal to the salary of the deputy bureau 
chief at the district level. Those of the party chapter 
secretaries and heads of the hamlet management boards are equal 
to the salary of village sector heads. In addition to the 
general stipulations, the border villages and key villages have 
been given a number of additional allowances. Although they do 
not match the labor of the primary-level cadres, these initial 
allowances have increased the enthusiasm of these people, given 
them peace of mind, and involved them deeply in the movements. 
  Because of the results achieved in party renovation and 
reorganization, Tay Ninh has had positive economic and social 
changes. As compared with previous years, since 1992, on many 
fronts Tay Ninh has made clear progress, and the rate of 
economic growth has been good. As compared with 1991, the 1992 
gross social product increased 8.7 percent, the national income 
increased 10 percent, and the value of agricultural yields 
increased 10.5 percent. Paddy yields reached 295,000 tons, the 
highest ever, averaging 309 kg of paddy per person per year. 
During the first 6 months of 1993, agricultural production 
increased in terms of both area and yields. As compared with the 
same time last year, the crop growing area has increased 4 
percent. In this, the rice area has increased 7 percent, the 
manioc area has increased 11 percent, and the peanut area has 
increased 3 percent. 
  The cultural and social spheres have made clear progress, 
too. Based on satisfactorily implementing the resolution of the 
Third Plenum of the CPV Central Committee, the province has 
implemented the resolutions of the fourth and fifth plenums of 
the CPV Central Committee, guided the sectors and echelons in 
formulating work programs, solved the urgent social problems, 
and improved the quality of the activities of the village 
literary blocks. What is worth noting is that the program to 
eliminate poverty has achieved good results and had a practical 
effect. The echelons, sectors, mass organizations, and people 
have responded to the movements, and many assets (of the state, 
social organizations, and people) have been mobilized. Most of 
the poor households now have capital to carry on production and 
engage in commercial and service activities. These households 
are being stabilized, and their standard of living is gradually 
rising. The number of poor households in the province has 
clearly declined. Today, the assets of this program have reached 
50 billion dong. A total of 23,215 households have been given 
loans and provided jobs in production, business, and service 
occupations. The number of households that lack food is 
declining daily. 
  Although this is a complex area where the enemy continues to 
implement plots to destroy the revolution, because the echelons 
and sectors in Tay Ninh have concentrated on providing 
leadership and guidance and invested much in security and 
national defense work, political security, order, and social 
safety here has been maintained. There have not been any major 
disturbances recently, and the evil plots of the destructive 
groups have been discovered and blocked in time. During the past 
period, social evils have declined greatly. 
  The initial results achieved by Tay Ninh in building the 
party prove that: 
  Renovating and reorganizing the party must also be tied to 
stabilizing and developing the economy and society and 
maintaining security and national defense. Solidifying the 
primary-level party organizations and improving the quality of 
the party members must go hand in hand with solving the pressing 
problems in the localities and at the bases. 
  In order to have a suitable plan of action, an all-around 
survey must be conducted from the party bases. The people must 
be allowed to contribute ideas to and discuss the action 
programs so that they can implement the programs along with the 
party. This will help create a close relationship between the 
party and the people. 
  Cadre work is always the key element in party renovation and 
reorganization. We must understand the cadres and party members, 
know the strengths and weaknesses of each person, formulate 
plans for recruiting, training, assigning, and using people, and 
have suitable compensation procedures and policies in order to 
create the conditions and mobilize people to satisfy the new 
needs of the revolution. 
  At present, Tay Ninh still has many difficulties, but the 
results that we have achieved in the past period have generated 
momentum for the next steps on the path of carrying on 
renovation.

  [Text] In a bid to reduce Japan's current account surplus, 
the government plans to announce a macroeconomic policy and a 
package of measures to relax regulations around 29 March. In 
this connection, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura met 
separately with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, International 
Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, and seven other 
ministers on 24 March to urge them to make further efforts to 
formulate the macroeconomic policy and map out the package of 
measures to relax regulations. He is scheduled to meet Koshiro 
Ishida, director general of the Management and Coordination 
Agency, and Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic 
Planning Agency, on 25 March. 
  The United States has asked Japan to cut taxes for many more 
years and increase public investment. At the meeting, Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Takemura and Finance Minister Fujii exchanged 
their views on ways to continue tax cuts after 1995 and increase 
basic plan for public investment which envisions a spending of 
430 trillion yen by the year 2000. It appears that Finance 
Minister Fujii indicated that it would be hard for the Finance 
Ministry to cut taxes for a longer period and increase public 
investment because of financial difficulties. Administrative 
Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito, who was present at the 
meeting, later told a news conference: "Moves are afoot to cut 
taxes and increase public investment, but in fact, however, it 
is more or less difficult to cuts taxes for a longer period and 
further increase public investment." In this way, he expressed 
the view that it would be difficult for the Finance Ministry to 
indicate specific figures of amount in the macroeconomic policy. 
  In this connection, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura told a 
news conference on the afternoon of 24 March: "The Tax System 
Reform Consultative Council of ruling parties is now holding a 
debate on (the issue of cutting and raising taxes). The council 
will take time before it draws a conclusion and it is expected 
in June. Nonetheless, the government has no intention of 
excluding the tax issue from the macroeconomic policy." 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura asked Construction Minister 
Kozo Igarashi to relax regulations on imports of construction 
materials and Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister 
Eijiro Hata to simplify the current inspection of imported food.

  [Text] The government's draft package of deregulation 
measures, which will form the core of the external economic 
policy the government plans to announce on 29 March, is aimed at 
promoting imports. In this package, the government expressly 
states such principles as the following: 1) to completely 
abolish or consider for review all regulations barring the 
import of foreign products; 2) to ease the system of standards, 
licensing, and labeling to levels comparable to those in other 
nations; and 3) to completely abolish dual inspection procedures 
whereby products which have been inspected prior to being 
shipped from a foreign country are reinspected after being 
imported into Japan. It is expected that based on these 
principles, the government will consider nearly 100 items for 
deregulation. 
  In February, the government compiled "ways to promote 
administrative reforms in the future" (administrative reform 
outline), which includes a list of 161 items for deregulation. 
Regarding these items, the government expressly states in its 
draft deregulation package that a comprehensive draft bill on 
deregulation will be submitted during the current Diet session 
to implement deregulation promptly. 
  Ever since the breakdown in the Japan-U.S. framework trade 
talks, the United States has stepped up its market-opening 
demands against Japan. Taking this into account, the government 
has spelled out measures to drastically ease regulations, 
standards, and licensing procedures for the import of foreign 
products. Concerning discrete Japanese regulations which 
virtually bar the import of foreign products, the government 
intends to consider plans to completely abolish them, or, if 
this is difficult, to at least ease them to the level in other 
Western nations. 
  In addition to such principles, the government plans to 
prepare on 29 March a separate list of items for deregulation, 
including inspection procedures for electrical appliances and 
standards and licensing procedures for automobiles. Moreover, 
the Administrative Reform Headquarters working panel on import 
promotion, market liberalization, and distribution systems plans 
to start on 28 March to hold discussions on items for 
deregulation which are to be included in the second stage of the 
compilation of the government's external economic policy in late 
June. During these discussions, a study will be made of such 
matters as regulations on the sales of pharmaceutical products 
through mail and the labeling of qualitative indicators on 
textile products.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 28 March Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] The main points of the Comprehensive Foreign 
Economic Policy Package (tentative title) to be compiled by the 
government on 29 March have been finalized. 
  Provisions relating to deregulation, the main attraction of 
the package, are focused on easing regulations for market 
participation, and relaxing the standards and licensing systems 
for nine sectors considered effective in promoting market 
participation, including housing and land, information and 
communications, distribution, and the financial and securities 
industry. Liquor and tobacco marketing, trucking, and the 
registration of new, imported cars are also cited for 
consideration. 
  New measures are also to be adopted for the insurance 
sector, 
one of the three priority areas in the Japan-U.S. framework 
talks. Measures in this area include the introduction of a 
"broker" system, in which brokers are independent of insurance 
companies and recommend insurers to clients for the benefit of 
clients, and permitting foreign nonlife insurance companies to 
become members of the Marine and Fire Insurance Association of 
Japan. 
  The foreign economic policy package consists of: 1) 
macroeconomic policies, including income and residential tax 
cuts and other tax reform measures; 2) four categories of market 
liberalization measures -- promoting deregulation, encouraging 
imports and investments, reinforcing policy on competition, and 
improving government procurement methods; and 3) measures 
dealing with the three priority sectors in the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks -- government procurement in 
telecommunications and medical equipment, automobiles and auto 
parts, and insurance. 
  The above measures will be approved officially on 29 March 
at 
a meeting of cabinet members in charge of foreign economic 
relations. They are meant to emphasize Japan's serious efforts 
to liberalize its market and cut the current account surpluses 
with other countries. Japan will indicate its intention to 
continue to consider any issues for which it could not come up 
with concrete solutions this time. Additional measures are 
expected to be announced in June, prior to the meeting of 
leaders of the Group of Seven advanced nations (Naples summit). 
  Aside from abolishing regulations which actually obstruct 
participation in the Japanese market, the government plans to 
compile further deregulation measures by the end of June, 
focusing on adapting standards and licensing methods, and 
inspection and certification systems to international norms, and 
simplifying administrative procedures. 
  The other priority areas in the list of nine, apart from 
housing and land, and other sectors mentioned above, are: 
Distribution; home electrical appliances; food; automobiles; 
and pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and cosmetics. 
Deregulation in these areas, where there is an enormous price 
gap between Japan and the foreign countries, will expand 
opportunities to supply Japan with cheap and desirable foreign 
products. Measures being considered include: Deregulation in 
the marketing of liquor and tobacco, a review of the regulations 
on communications and broadcasting, pharmaceuticals and medical 
equipment standards, storage business standards, electrical and 
gas equipment licensing standards, and easing the type 
certification procedure for automobiles. 
  The government will emphasize its efforts to introduce more 
transparency into administrative procedures, and to ease 
insurance regulations, one of the three priority sectors in the 
framework talks. This is because the existing Insurance Law and 
other laws on foreign insurers do not have explicit provisions 
on licensing standards and Japan has been criticized abroad 
because "licensing decisions are based on ambiguous and 
inscrutable standards." 
  The government will formally announce the introduction of a 
"broker" system. It has decided to accept this demand made by 
the United States at the framework talks, and to start preparing 
the necessary legislation and administrative procedures -- for 
instance, on the licensing of brokers. And membership by 
foreign insurers in the Marine and Fire Insurance Association is 
being included as an additional measure in light of the 
association's amendment of its charter last January.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Think of Japan-U.S. Relations--Break the </F>
Deadlock in Relations With Speedy Action"] 
  [Text] Japan-U.S. economic frictions are heightening 
tensions in the two countries' relations. While it is said that 
the two nations are increasing their interdependence, they are 
deepening their mutual distrust. Why is this happening? 
  The cause of this situation is the February Japan-U.S. 
summit 
talks, which ended with no agreement being reached. Japan has 
not taken voluntary and persuasive actions to resolve the 
economic frictions between Japan and the United States after the 
prime minister said no to U.S. trade demands. In the United 
States, the President has increasing taken a hard-line stand 
against Japan on trade while hinting at the possibility of 
slapping sanctions on Japan. 
  The relations between Japan and the United States, which 
account for 40 percent of the world's gross national product, 
should not be left as they are. Worsening Japan-U.S. relations 
would not only hurt the national interests of the two countries, 
but would also bring instability to Asia and would affect the 
world negatively. Many nations are now concerned by how 
Japan-U.S. relations will develop in the future. 
  Therefore, the two countries should by all means overcome 
their current economic frictions. If the two nations pool their 
wisdom, they will certainly overcome their economic frictions. 
  Where, then, is the heart of the economic frictions? What 
should the two nations do to ease their economic frictions? We 
hope that both Japan and the United States will return to the 
starting point of their relations and think calmly about how to 
improve and move forward their relations without criticizing 
each other. 
  The most important point is that shock waves resulting from 
the end of the cold war have now reached the economic imbalance 
between Japan and the United States. In that sense, it can be 
said that the latest developments involving Japan-U.S. relations 
are a totally new and difficult trial for postwar Japan-U.S. 
diplomacy. 
<H5>  Break Away From "Optimism" During the Cold War Age </H5>
  First of all, Japan urgently needs to discard the optimistic 
view that it held during the cold war era and to fundamentally 
change how it handles its relations with the United States. 
  Japan-U.S. trade frictions during the cold war era, no 
matter 
how fierce they were, were prevented from developing to the 
breaking point by the 11th-hour intervention of the Departments 
of Defense and State because of the existence of the Soviet 
Union, which was a common threat to the two nations. 
  It has been pointed out that the recent Japan-U.S. summit 
talks broke off because this time the traditional mediatory role 
played by the Departments of Defense and State did not work in 
the end. The so-called "water table" of security in bilateral 
economic talks has dropped, thus pitting the two nations against 
each other over economic interests. 
  This is an important point. While the United States does not 
care about the decrease in the "water table," the weight of the 
United States in Japan's security remains unchanged. This is 
clear if we look at the situation on the Korean peninsula and in 
Asia, which remains unstable. 
  The heart of problem lies in the combination of the Asian 
situation and Japan's $130 billion annual current-account 
surplus and its $50 billion trade surplus with the United States. 
<H5>  Japan's Huge Surplus Is the Problem </H5>
  Japan's huge surplus has given the impression abroad that 
Japan is the only nation that won the cold war. Japan's massive 
surplus has already reached a level that cannot be tolerated 
politically, although it can be justified by academic analysis 
and logic. We cannot help but say that Japan does not fully 
understand this stern view. 
  Japan, in a flurry of trade white papers and official 
government documents, has continued to criticize U.S. trade 
policy, which increasingly has tilted toward managed trade since 
the Clinton administration was inaugurated. It can be said that 
Japan's criticism has been so well-grounded that U.S. experts 
have echoed it. 
  However, we regret actions taken by Japan itself after its 
criticism of the United States. Japan has failed to speedily 
take measures to turn the Japanese market into a transparent and 
open market. The brakes will be put on managed trade only when 
Japan firmly stands up for maintaining the free trade system. 
  It is clear what tasks Japan should accomplish as a 
frontrunner of the world economy. 
  The government should take measures to expand Japan's 
domestic demand and further open the Japanese market. What is 
important for Japan is speedy action. The private sector should 
reject the government's intervention, which disrupts the market, 
and should make independent efforts to boost imports. 
  To that end, the government should first voluntarily set a 
medium-term target for reducing Japan's current-account surplus. 
  Second, the government should speedily overhaul the current 
tax system and decide to cut the income tax for three years 
prior to raising the consumption tax. 
  Third, the government should try to add more than 100 
trillion yen to the basic plan for public investment after 
making clear how it will secure revenue to cover the additional 
amount. Needless to say, the government should review the 
conventional allocation of public investment in the basic plan 
to prepare for the arrival of a graying society and the 
information age. 
  The government also should take measures to relax 
regulations 
and to liberalize direct foreign investment in Japan. We hope 
that the government will more boldly relax regulations and 
liberalize foreign investment in Japan than is the case in other 
industrialized nations. The promotion of fair competition 
through the stringent enforcement of the Antimonopoly Law is 
indispensable. 
  It is important to employ publicity to get the message 
across 
to the world that Japan is taking action. We would like to 
propose anew holding an "import summit" where Japanese 
entrepreneurs and ordinary Japanese meet together to discuss how 
to boost Japan's imports. Americans' attendance at the summit 
is welcomed. 
<H5>  The U.S. Withdrawal of Sanctions Against Japan Is the Key </H5>
  There is a major prerequisite for Japan's voluntary actions: 
The United States should withdraw its approach of unilateral 
sanctions against Japan, such as the Super 301 provision of the 
1988 Omnibus Trade Act, and indicate its intention to deal with 
trade frictions with Japan on the basis of sound thinking. 
  The U.S. International Trade Administration (ITA), which had 
examined a dumping complaint filed by U.S. steelmakers against 
Japanese steelmakers involving steel wire being sold on the U.S. 
market, handed down a final ruling on 17 March that the Japanese 
steelmakers did not inflict any damages on U.S. steelmakers. It 
can be said that the final ruling was a decision that reflected 
the actual state of the Japanese and U.S. economies, which rely 
on each other. Mutual retaliation between the two countries 
have ended in both of them shooting themselves in the foot. 
  It is necessary for both Japan and the United States to work 
to broaden the scope of their diplomacies from a medium- and 
long-term perspective. The creation of a wise men's conference 
of Japanese and U.S. opinion makers is worthy of a full study. 
The conference is expected to play the role of preventing any 
fresh frictions between the two countries by providing early 
warnings of them. 
  We would like to refrain from commenting on the lack of 
political leadership in Japan in this editorial. But, now is 
the time for politicians to break with their past practice of 
using "external pressure to accomplish Japan's domestic reforms."

<F P=106> [By Yoshiaki Ito; from MAINICHI SHIMBUN 24 March Evening </F>
Edition] 
  [Text] Geneva, 23 Mar -- At a regular meeting of the GATT 
board of directors on 23 March, Japan expressed grave concern 
over the reinstatement of the Super 301 provision of the U.S. 
Trade and Competitiveness Act (which imposes sanctions on 
nations engaging in unfair trade practices). Other 
participants, including the European Union (EU), supported 
Japan's stance. 
  At the end of the meeting, the Japanese representative 
expressed serious concern over the 3 March U.S. decision to 
revive the Super 301 provision, saying: "The U.S. Government's 
retaliatory measures against Japan run counter to agreements 
under GATT's new multilateral trade negotiations (Uruguay 
Round)." 
  In response, the U.S. representative stated: "This measure 
is not based on protectionism but is perfectly compatible with 
GATT articles." However, South Korea urged the United States to 
immediately abolish the Super 301 provision. Moreover, the EU, 
Argentina, Australia, and Hong Kong expressed their support for 
Japan's stance, and urged the U.S. Government to reconsider its 
decision. It can be said the U.S. Government was subjected to 
much criticism.

<F P=106> [By Shigeru Komago] </F>
  [Text] Waikoloa, Hawaii, 23 Mar -- The regular Japan-U.S. 
consultation on semiconductors closed on 23 March with both 
sides agreeing that both the government and private sectors 
should "exert further efforts to improve participation in the 
Japanese market" by foreign semiconductors. 
  "The two governments" agreed to "promote" the following 
concrete steps: 1) encourage joint development from the design 
phase (design-in); and 2) expand purchase in three priority 
sectors -- automobiles, telecommunications, and electronic 
games. The United States succeeded in clarifying the Japanese 
Government's involvement and the concrete actions to be taken. 
It has gained a new stepping stone to increasing market share. 
It also asked for the participation of the Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone Corporation (NTT) and the automobile makers in future 
semiconductor meetings, aiming at direct deals with NTT and the 
other companies. 
  On the second day of the intergovernmental negotiations, 
only 
government officials, led by Hisamitsu Arai, deputy director 
general of the Machinery and Information Industries Bureau, 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry, on the Japanese 
side, and Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Donald Phillips on 
the U.S. side, were allowed to participate in the 
four-and-a-half hour session on the morning of 23 March (early 
hours of 24 March, Japan time). The central issue was 
government involvement in the new operational plan to promote a 
stable increase of foreign semiconductors' participation in the 
Japanese market, which had been basically agreed upon during the 
joint government and private sector session on the first day of 
the meeting. 
  According to sources in both delegations, the agreement 
reached in the present meeting reconfirmed the points agreed 
upon in the Japan-U.S. Semiconductor Accord. The meeting 
clarified government involvement in the form of "promotion and 
encouragement" [of private-sector efforts]. It decided on 
concrete steps to be taken, and thus reinforced the bilateral 
agreement. However, both sides affirmed that this does not mean 
increasing the share of foreign semiconductors in the Japanese 
market beyond 20 percent, and "will not be directly linked with 
an increase in share target." 
  With regard to concrete actions to be taken by the 
government 
to support the private sector, of the four items proposed by the 
United States on the first day, Japan agreed to campaign for 
design-in, while the United States pledged active participation. 
As to setting priority sectors for semiconductor procurement, 
it was agreed that measures will be taken to expand purchase in 
the automobile, telecommunications and electronic games sectors, 
as demanded by the United States. 
  Regarding the two other U.S. demands, the United States 
conceded and backed off on its proposal concerning the expansion 
of major Japanese companies' purchase of foreign semiconductors 
after Japan had explained that "we are already making efforts."

  [Text] At the Japan-U.S. semiconductor talks, the U.S. 
side asked that Japan boost its purchase of foreign-made 
semiconductors in three fields -- automobiles, 
telecommunications, and game machines. In response, Japanese 
automakers and other manufacturers are perplexed at the U.S. 
request. 
  "In the past, Toyota Motor Corporation and Honda Motor 
Company announced their plans to increase the share of 
foreign-made semiconductors in their purchase of semiconductors 
to 20 percent by 1993. In fact, however, this year's share of 
foreign-made semiconductors in the purchase of semiconductors by 
the entire Japanese automobile sector is expected to fall to 8 
percent" (according to an official concerned at the 
Semiconductor Industry Association). This prospect is believed 
to have prompted the U.S. side to make the request at the 
Japan-U.S. semiconductor talks. 
  The Japanese automakers are taking a different view, 
however. 
They are rebuffing the U.S. request, claiming that "the share of 
foreign-made semiconductors in our purchase of chips is supposed 
to have already reached 20 percent" (says a senior official of 
Toyota Motor Corporation). 
  Motorola, Texas Instruments, and other American chip makers 
have admitted that the purchase of foreign microchips by the 
Japanese automakers has been steadily increasing. 
  Game machine makers are responding the same way. The share 
of 
foreign chips in Nintendo Company's purchase of semiconductors 
in 1993 was 21.3 percent and the share of foreign semiconductors 
in the total purchase of chips by Sega Enterprises is said to be 
hovering around 16-23 percent.

  [Text] Officials of the ruling coalition parties in charge 
of political affairs and policy met U.S. Ambassador to Japan 
Walter Mondale at a hotel in Tokyo on 24 March to exchange views 
on the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. This was 
the first time the ruling parties held a dialogue with the U.S. 
Government on this issue. 
  Mondale said during the meeting, "We are interested in 
policy, and not in market share," expressing high expectations 
on the policy package to expand domestic demand and liberalize 
the market that the Japanese Government is working on. 
  The ruling parties expressed the opinion that the United 
States should change its attitude of asking for immediate 
action, saying "the U.S. Government should attach importance to 
the negotiation process, and not to the results." However, the 
ambassador said, "The United States is not satisfied with the 
process of Japan-U.S. economic negotiations so far. We need an 
early solution." He reiterated a call on the Japanese 
Government to come up quickly with radical measures to effect a 
breakthrough in bilateral relations. 
  At the meeting, Mondale also commented on the issue of 
nuclear inspections in the DPRK (North Korea). He expressed his 
concern, saying: "The (North Korean) leaders are isolated. We 
have worked hard to reach a peaceful solution. This situation 
is indeed distressing." 
  Regarding steps to be taken from now on, he said, "The 
deployment of Patriot missiles is purely defensive. While I am 
in favor of conducting the Team Spirit exercises, this will not 
be the solution. It is one of the options." He also stated that 
"economic sanctions may have to be imposed."

  [Text] Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. announced on 25 March a 
"new program for international cooperation" showing its plan for 
purchasing automobiles and auto parts made in European nations 
and the United States. According to the program, it plans to 
purchase $4.3 billion worth of U.S.-made auto parts in fiscal 
1997 (up 80 percent from fiscal 1992). On expansion of import 
of finished automobiles, it said that "we are ready to accept 
auto manufacturers' request to expand purchase of their 
automobiles and we can ask domestic dealers--which also deal in 
foreign-made automobiles--to increase their sales efforts for 
imported cars." Following the failure in the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks in February, each of the major auto 
manufacturers has started considering working out its own plan 
for purchases of U.S.-made automobiles and parts. Nissan is the 
fist manufacturer to officially announce its own purchase scheme. 
  "The new program" is a revised version of "the international 
cooperation program" announced in 1989 and 1991, and it is 
mainly composed of: 1) an automobile production plan in the 
United States, Mexico, and European nations, and a parts 
purchase plan; 2) an auto parts import plan; and 3) a plan to 
cooperate with foreign auto manufacturers in promoting importing 
finished automobiles. 
  As for the U.S.-made automobiles and parts, Nissan, by 
taking 
advantage of its plan to produce new model of "Sentra" (known as 
"Sunny" in Japan] at U.S. Nissan Motor Manufacturing Company 
(NMMC), plans to increase the amount of purchases of U.S.-made 
parts needed for assembly and repairs to approximately $3.4 
billion in fiscal 1997 ($1.95 billion spent in fiscal 1992) on 
the assumption that the NMMC is fully operational and produces 
approximately 450,000 Sentras. 
  Moreover, Nissan plans to import over $9 million of worth 
U.S.-made parts and materials in fiscal 1997 ($4.4 million in 
fiscal 1992) on the assumption that Nissan produces 
approximately 1.8 million autos a year in Japan. 
  When (then) President Bush visited Japan in January 1992, 
Nissan set $3.7 billion ($2.9 billion for purchases in the 
United States and $800 million for import) as its U.S. 
automobile parts purchase goal for fiscal 1994. In this 
connection, the actual amount of purchases of U.S.-made parts in 
fiscal 1993 is likely to reach $3.3 billion. 
  Meanwhile, Nissan intends not to get itself directly 
involved 
in campaign for the promotion of sales of imported automobiles. 
However, at the request of foreign manufacturers, it plans to 
ask its "keiretsu" dealers to handle foreign-made automobiles. 
Such Nissan-affiliated dealers in Kanto and Kansai districts as 
Tokyo Nissan Sales Dealer have announced their plans to deal in 
U.S. Ford- made automobiles from 1994. 
  In the announcement of its new program, Nissan said that "we 
have judged that private-sector efforts will lead to preventing 
international trade friction," thus indicating a stand of 
drawing a line between its own program and a package of 
market-opening measures being worked out by the government. 
  Moreover, Nissan stressed "there may be a change in the 
target figures described in the program if assumed preconditions 
are not met."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Private Sector's Voluntary Efforts Needed To </F>
Ease Friction"] 
  [Text] Amid growing mutual distrust between the two 
governments caused by a failure in economic framework talks at 
the Japan-U.S. summit, economic circles are now urged to play a 
role in correcting the situation. 
  Despite the fact that following the Japan-U.S. textile 
negotiations in the 1970's, Japan has been in constant friction 
with the United States, economic relations between the two 
countries on the private-sector level have been steadily 
promoted. 
  According to the latest survey of the Japan External Trade 
Organization, the number of factories operated by 
Japanese-affiliated companies in the United States has reached 
1,700, seven times than in the first survey in 1981. The survey 
shows that approximately 400,000 persons are hired by 
Japanese-affiliated companies and that those companies' 
activities to contribute to local welfare are brisk. The report 
also says that, as of December last year, 780 joint projects 
have been confirmed in the area of joint development, technical 
cooperation, and joint venture. 
  Companies' cooperation with local community through their 
daily economic activities and mutual understanding between 
employees and the management through social activities are very 
important to maintain good relations between Japan and the 
United States. 
  However, there are other tasks for the private sector to 
carry out. 
  Underlying the current Japan-U.S. economic friction is 
Japan's huge trade surplus and closed nature of its markets in 
various fields. 
  In its demand calling for Japan's market opening and 
deregulations, the United States has pointed out that there are 
various obstacles to rectifying trade frictions--such as 
construction firms' bid-rigging practice and regulations of 
large retail stores, insurance, and transportation business. 
  It can be said that industrial circles concerned have 
enjoyed 
prosperity under an "umbrella" of such regulations. They need 
to make voluntary efforts to correct the current situation. 
  In promoting purchase of foreign-made automobiles and 
autoparts, which is one of the immediate issues to be solved, 
the auto industry has started making voluntary efforts. 
  Major auto dealers affiliated with Nissan Motor are getting 
ready to deal in Ford-made automobiles while Toyota-affiliated 
dealers plan to start selling compact cars made by General 
Motors (GM) from 1996. Each of the major automobile companies 
is working out its own plan to purchase foreign-made auto parts, 
including U.S.-made parts. 
  In response to such voluntary efforts of the automobile 
industry, a top U.S. official in charge of trade recently called 
on the Japanese Government to guarantee voluntary targets the 
auto industry will set in its plan. On the other hand, it has 
been reported that welcoming the private sector's voluntary 
efforts, the Japanese Government, which is scheduled to announce 
its market-opening measures late this month, is considering 
including the automobile industry's voluntary plan in its 
market-opening measures as the pillar of the measures. However, 
such reactions by the two governments have resulted in the 
automobile industry's criticism. 
  We think that such moves by the two governments will put 
cold 
water on the private sector's voluntary efforts to rectify trade 
friction and run counter to the principle of free trade and 
deregulations. We believe that what the two governments have to 
do is to create an environment in which other business sectors 
can take voluntary actions, rather than intervening in the auto 
industry's voluntary plan. 
  In addition, leaders of the business circle are assigned an 
important role. Although business leaders from Japan and the 
United States hold an annual meeting, it has been reported that 
there is a rapidly growing move among the members for changing 
the nature of the meeting -- from a place for exchanging 
opinions to opportunities to take positive actions to remove 
friction. 
  Some of the Japanese and American members of the meeting are 
said to have their own personal connections with persons who are 
concerned with policymaking. In this sense, we hope that 
business leaders, by taking advantage of a network of their 
personal contacts, will actively contribute to improving 
Japan-U.S. economic relations.

  [Text] On the morning of 24 March, a government source 
noted acceptance of numerical targets is difficult even in the 
government procurement sector. 
  Regarding the economic framework talks, the United States 
recently urged Japan to accept numerical targets for government 
procurement, one of the three priority negotiation fields at the 
framework talks. Commenting on the U.S. demand, the source 
said: "The U.S. demand probably means they think it is easier to 
promise (numerical targets) in fields under control of the 
public sector, but it is still difficult. Even under the market 
opening policy, we cannot buy what we do not need."

  [Text] During a meeting with ROK President Kim Yong-sam on 
24 March, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa expressed his backing 
to South Korea for its plan to apply for nonpermanent membership 
of the UN Security Council [UNSC] in 1995. Besides South Korea, 
Sri Lanka has also announced candidacy for the UNSC seat to be 
vacated by Pakistan, the present representative for Asia in the 
council.

  [Text] On 24 March, Kazuo Aichi, director general of the 
Defense Agency [DA], met with Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the South 
Korea Joint Chiefs of Staff who is accompanying President Kim 
Yong-sam on his state visit to Japan. Discussing the situation 
on the Korean peninsula, Yi said: "Tensions are heightening 
between North and South Korea. South Korea is trying to prevent 
North Korea from taking any provocative action against the South 
by introducing `Patriot' ground-to-air missiles as part of South 
Korea-U.S. military cooperation."

  [Text] South Korean President Kim Yong-sam met with former 
Japanese prime ministers and leaders of both ruling coalition 
parties, and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party at the 
State Guesthouse on the afternoon of 25 March. Referring to 
North Korea's suspected nuclear development during a meeting 
with former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, the South Korean 
president said: "I think that North Korea does not have nuclear 
weapons." This is the first time the president has acknowledged 
the nonexistence of nuclear weapons in North Korea since he 
arrived in Japan. The president went on to say: "North Korea 
is eager to develop nuclear weapons, however, I intend to 
resolve the issue while closely cooperating with Japan."

<F P=106> [By Hiroshi Yamazaki of the Political News Department] </F>
  [Text] At his speech to the Japanese Diet, ROK President 
Kim Yong-sam solemnly suggested "putting an end to the history 
of strife between Japan and South Korea." He took an 
epoch-making step toward establishing "future-oriented" 
relations between the two countries during his visit to Japan. 
  However, tension is extremely high on the Korean peninsula 
over the DPRK's (North Korea's) suspected development of nuclear 
arms. How to deal with this nuclear issue has become the focal 
issue for Japan and the ROK at the moment. The most amount of 
time was devoted to this issue during President Kim's summit 
meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Kim was 
determined to pursue "future-oriented" bilateral relations even 
in the face of the serious problem of nuclear arms. In light of 
such a stance, Japan has to exert serious efforts toward a new 
relationship between the two countries. 
  A top Foreign Ministry official commented that the Diet 
speech "clearly attached importance to future-oriented bilateral 
relations, rather than to the nuclear issue." 
  In his Diet speech, Kim said firmly, "We have to eliminate 
completely all ill-feelings in the past. The South Korean 
people do not hesitate to set their eyes on the bright future." 
  According to a Foreign Ministry source, Japanese officials 
were very touched by President Kim's remark. They believe "this 
is a very welcome statement for Japan." However, it is also 
true that "this is the ROK president and government's position. 
We still have to see what the South Koreans think," (according 
to a top Foreign Ministry official). 
  The Japanese assessment of this visit is: "Through this 
round of talks, we feel that we have climbed one, two, or even 
three mountains in the Japan-ROK relations," (according to a 
Foreign Ministry source). Therefore, Japan, in turn, has to 
take immediate concrete measures to deal with the nuclear issue 
and bilateral problems.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Stop North Korea's Provocations"] </F>
  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
decided on 21 March to submit the issue of nuclear inspections 
of the DPRK (North Korea) to the UN Security Council [UNSC]. 
Depending on how North Korea behaves, the UNSC may discuss how 
to deal with the DPRK, with the imposition of economic sanctions 
being a possibility. It will not do the DPRK and the 
international community any good if this problem deteriorates 
any further. We repeat our call on North Korea to contemplate 
the situation coolheadedly and realistically. 
  During the recent IAEA inspection tour, North Korea 
obstructed the inspection of a number of its nuclear facilities 
which are suspected of being involved in developing nuclear 
weapons. The IAEA objected to this and demanded that the DPRK 
accept inspections immediately. North Korea refused, and thus, 
IAEA decided to bring the issue to the UNSC. The UNSC is 
expected to adopt a resolution demanding the acceptance of 
nuclear inspections, and there is a strong possibility that 
economic sanctions may also be considered. 
  In response, North Korea objected strongly to these moves, 
and it has threatened to withdraw from the nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). This is the second time that it 
has made such a threat, and this is the second time that the 
UNSC has taken up this question. The international community has 
been at the mercy of North Korea. As Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa told Premier Li Peng during his visit to the PRC, "the 
international community" has reached the limit of "its patience." 
  The international community is still forced to treat the 
DPRK 
with discretion because it is concerned about the military 
action that the Kim Il-song regime might take. At the stalled 
working-level meeting on the exchange of envoys between North 
and South Korea, the North even made remarks about the 
possibility of war. On the other hand, there is also a sense of 
urgency because the issue has to do with nuclear "deadly 
weapons," and it might be too late if something is not done 
right away. 
  However, it is not advisable for the international community 
to be twisted around the DPRK's finger and to panic every time 
it does something. If this happens again and again, there is 
the danger that the DPRK will always lead the international 
community by the nose. It might be necessary to take a more 
detached attitude. 
  The United States has decided to deploy Patriot antimissile 
missiles in South Korea. It is also considering resuming joint 
military exercises with the ROK. These are obviously deterrent 
measures to stop the North from making a wrong move. We also 
hope that the channels for a solution through negotiations will 
be kept open. 
  If a UNSC resolution and economic sanctions come to pass, 
North Korea's reaction will be even more defiant. However, the 
DPRK is already very isolated, and its economy is in very 
serious trouble. There is no need to rush even if economic 
sanctions are to be imposed. 
  China's leaders are not eager to take tough measures against 
North Korea. They seem to believe that progress through 
negotiations is still possible. If so, we hope that China will 
exercise its influence to bring about tangible results.

  [Text] North Korea's suspected nuclear development program 
has again been referred to the UN Security Council [UNSC]. In 
this connection, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] source 
disclosed on 23 March that a task force has already been set up 
within MOFA to deal with economic sanctions to be imposed by the 
UNSC on North Korea and with other situations, and that the task 
force is fully prepared to consult with other government 
ministries and agencies. Commenting on the prospect of the UNSC 
adopting a resolution, the same MOFA source pointed out, "The 
UNSC will adopt a resolution urging North Korea to accept 
complete nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency and will then see how North Korea responds to the 
resolution." The source also added that the possibility of the 
UNSC imposing economic sanctions on North Korea at this point is 
slim. The source indicated that if the UNSC decides to impose 
economic sanctions on North Korea, "Japan is obliged to go along 
with them as a member nation of the United Nations." As for the 
need to amend current laws and ordinances for Japan to comply 
with the economic sanctions, the source clearly said, "Each 
government ministry and agency is now closely examining ways to 
amend them." 
  The economic sanctions against North Korea may create a 
serious situation for Japan's security, and for that reason the 
task force is expected to study 1) ways to ban remittances by 
ethnic Koreans in Japan to North Korea, for these remittances 
have been strongly criticized by the United States and other 
nations; 2) the possibility of increasing reconnaissance and 
information-collecting activities by the Self-Defense Forces in 
accordance with UNSC resolutions; 3) ways to airlift about 9,000 
Japanese in South Korea back to Japan if South Korea enters an 
emergency situation. 
  The same MOFA source indicated that "it is impossible for 
the 
Japanese Government to regulate visits by ethnic Koreans in 
Japan to North Korea through which money is remitted from Japan 
to North Korea." The source, however, declined to definitely 
comment on the possibility of suspending the issuing of reentry 
visas for ethnic Koreans.

  [Text] A Foreign Ministry source indicated on 23 March 
that, in connection with the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected 
development of nuclear devices, amendments to the Self-Defense 
Forces Law (to allow the use of government aircraft to rescue 
Japanese abroad) should be promptly included on the Diet's 
agenda to facilitate the rescue of around 10,000 Japanese living 
in South Korea in case of an emergency situation developing on 
the Korean peninsula. 
  This source also touched on the issue of stopping 
remittances 
to North Korea from Japan if the UN Security Council [UNSC] 
decides to impose economic sanctions. He said that while 
remittances through banks can be stopped, those passing through 
Hong Kong and other third countries can only be stopped with the 
cooperation of the governments concerned. However, regarding 
cash carried in person to North Korea from Japan: "It is 
impossible to prohibit North Korean residents in Japan from 
visiting the DPRK. We are still considering to what extent we 
can check the flow of cash when they exit the country, and 
whether or not to issue reentry visas (because human rights 
issues are involved)." 
  The Foreign Ministry source also stated that economic 
sanctions will be imposed in several stages and that in such a 
case, considerable measures can be taken under existing laws. 
  With regard to the UNSC resolution that may be adopted by 25 
March (New York time) at the earliest, this source predicted 
that "it will not touch on sanctions and will be limited to a 
call to accept unconditional inspections by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)." He said that whether or not 
sanctions are imposed "depends on how North Korea behaves after 
the resolution is adopted."

  [Text] At the 24 March summit talks, Japan and the ROK 
agreed that "the international community should jointly show a 
firm stance" towards the DPRK's (North Korea's) alleged nuclear 
weapons program. 
  Following recent talks with U.S. and Chinese leaders, Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa again pledged to ROK President Kim 
Yong-sam that, if the UN Security Council [UNSC] imposes 
sanctions against North Korea, Japan would take "responsible 
measures" as a member of the United Nations. Japan has never 
deeply engaged itself in security issues in East Asia like this. 
However, the United Nations may impose not only economic 
sanctions, but also further actions such as a sea blockade. In 
that case, Japan is likely to be thrown into a constitutional 
controversy over the nation's collective defense rights. 
  The government has been expressing its hope that North Korea 
would accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) through diplomatic efforts. As Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said: "We hope North Korea will 
use sound judgment in line with the opinions of the 
international community." On the other hand, the Secretariat is 
studying definite measures for coping with the worst 
developments. A top Foreign Ministry official said "it is 
inappropriate to discuss our course of action at prsent," but it 
is believed the government is preparing phased measures to 
follow moderate sanctions of the United Nations. 
  The Foreign Ministry feels the UNSC is unlikely to adopt 
full-fledged sanctions against North Korea immediately. Rather, 
the UNSC is expected to issue a statement urging North Korea to 
fully accept IAEA inspections as a first step. Policymakers in 
the government think: "The likeliest choice for the United 
Nations is multinational sanctions imposed on the step-by-step 
basis, which means strengthening sanctions one step at a time 
depending on developments." 
  When the United Nations takes such a measure, possible 
options for Japan are: 1) a ban on remittances to North Korea; 
2) a trade embargo; and 3) restrictions on travel to North 
Korea. It is systematically possible that Japan would ban 
remittances to North Korea; even in that case, however, those 
who want to send money to North Korea can still do so via third 
countries. Moreover, the government would have to control money 
taken out of Japan by Korean residents who travel to North 
Korea. The government can limit the amount of currency taken 
abroad by those travelers, or can tighten the issuance of 
re-entry visas, but these may become human right problems, and 
their effectiveness is questionable. 
  Japan would face an even more difficult situation if the 
United Nations imposes full-fledged sanctions, such as a sea 
blockade against North Korea. If the United Nations requests 
the cooperation of the Self-Defense Forces or definite 
operations in such punitive actions, the conflict between 
constitutional restrictions and international demands would 
certainly create a furious controversy in Japan. The 
international community would criticize Japan if it hesitates in 
participating in UN decisions. In that case, the government 
would face a Catch-22. 
  The coalition government has been neglecting improvement of 
its crisis management capability. The Foreign Ministry is 
afraid that "the coalition may not agree on anti-North Korea 
sanctions," and the issue can create friction within the 
coalition government. At the summit, Prime Minister Hosokawa 
hoped Japan-ROK-U.S. harmony and international pressures would 
result in concessions by North Korea. Probably, the remark 
reflects the Japanese Government's lack of determination.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "China Urged To Cooperate With Japan, South </F>
Korea, and the United States in Resolving Issue of North Korea's 
Suspected Nuclear Development"] 
  [Text] At the first round of Japan-South Korea summit 
talks on 24 March, both Prime Minister Hosokawa and South Korean 
President Kim Yong-sam agreed on the point that Japan, South 
Korea, and the United States should closely cooperate in dealing 
with the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear development. 
In order to wring concessions from North Korea, China's 
aggressive efforts to persuade North Korea are indispensable 
because it has maintained friendly relations with North Korea. 
President Kim is set to pay a visit to China on 26 March and how 
he wins cooperation from the Chinese leadership has become a 
focal point. 
  One year has already passed since North Korea was found to 
be 
suspected of developing nuclear weapons, but North Korea's 
insincere attitude has deepened suspicions that it is developing 
nuclear weapons. As Prime Minister Hosokawa stated in Beijing, 
the international community is losing its patience with North 
Korea. The UN Security Council appears to be adopting a 
resolution calling on North Korea to accept nuclear inspections 
by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Our view is that if 
North Korea continues to take the tough stand, it will be 
inevitable for the UN Security Council to discuss slapping 
economic sanctions against it. Needless to say, enforcing 
economic sanctions would be met with various difficulties. To 
make the economic sanctions effective, Japan probably needs to 
ban the remittance of money by ethnic Koreans in Japan to North 
Korea, but it is not easy for Japan to completely ban it. A 
humanitarian issue would be raised depending on the way the 
Japanese Government deals with ethnic Koreans in Japan. If a 
sea blockade is imposed against North Korea, Japan would face 
the question of how far the Self-Defense Forces should cooperate 
with the sea blockade. Full discussions should be held to look 
for ways to resolve those problems without keeping them secret. 
  There still remains another course of action. Attempts 
should be made to persuade North Korea to the last without 
closing the door for a dialogue with that country. 
  In that instance, China holds the key. How earnestly will 
China persuade North Korea? It exports more than 1 million tons 
of oil to North Korea a year. It is in a position to exercise 
great influence on North Korea if it wants to. 
  On the present state of North Korea's nuclear development, 
China takes a different view from those of Japan, South Korea, 
and the United States. It is opposed to applying hasty 
international pressure on North Korea. As for persuading North 
Korea, it has said, "We will make efforts to persuade North 
Korea, but there is a limit to our role in persuading that 
country." 
  President Kim will visit China on 26 March and the 
international community will pay close attention on how he will 
urge China to abandon its passive attitude and make more 
vigorous efforts than ever to persuade North Korea. We hope that 
in response to President Kim's call, China will cooperate a 
little more vigorously with Japan, South Korea, and the United 
States. 
  If there were a forum to discuss the issue of security in 
Northeast Asia, a summit meeting would be held to focus its 
attention on the issue of North Korea's nuclear development. 
Given the present situation in which such a forum does not 
exist, neighboring nations have no choice but to work to resolve 
the issue through frequent exchange of visits. 
  This time, South Korea is playing an important role as a 
spadeworker and we would like to note its role. South Korea 
could not play such a role before that country and China 
normalized their relations. If Japan and South Korea had 
continued to stick to the issue of their past history, it would 
have been difficult for the two countries to take such concerted 
steps. We hope that a forum will be created to discuss security 
of Northeast Asia after the issue of North Korea's nuclear 
development is resolved.

  [Text] The government plans to spell out a "tripartite 
cooperation" to deal with the issue of the DPRK's (North Korea) 
suspected nuclear arms development during talks with top defense 
authorities from the United States and the ROK who plan to visit 
Japan successively in late April. It has decided to carry out 
this plan in consideration of results of the Japan-ROK summit 
meeting, which concluded on 26 March. The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, the Defense Agency [DA], and other relevant government 
ministries and agencies plan to make analyses of the current 
situation and future trends regarding the DPRK's nuclear 
development. In addition, they plan to hasten research efforts 
to get ready for "firm responses" which Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa expressed in talks with ROK President Kim Yong-sam in 
the event a resolution should be passed by the UN Security 
Council [UNSC] to impose economic sanctions against North Korea. 
  U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry plans to visit Japan on 
19 April immediately after his visit to the ROK which begins on 
16 April. He will hold talks with Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime 
minister and concurrently foreign minister, and Kazuo Aichi, 
director general of the DA. After Perry, ROK National Defense 
Minister Yi Pyong-tae is scheduled to visit Japan in late April. 
  By the time these top U.S. and ROK defense officials visit 
Japan in late April, it is expected that tensions will have 
mounted over the question of whether economic sanctions should 
be imposed against North Korea if that country should continue 
to take a tough stance, such as by rejecting the International 
Atomic Energy Agency's reinspection of its nuclear facilities. 
Because talks have been scheduled in succession between top 
U.S. and ROK defense officials, between top Japanese and U.S. 
defense officials, and finally between top Japanese and ROK 
defense officials all around this time, it seems this is an 
attempt to apply "pressure" on North Korea to make it soften its 
attitude. 
  The reason is that Japan has its own problems. In the event 
of the "worst case" when the UNSC should adopt a resolution to 
impose economic sanctions against North Korea and a naval 
blockade should be enforced, it would be nearly impossible for 
Japan to participate in such endeavors under its current legal 
restrictions. If the United Nations were to request Japanese 
cooperation by asking for deployment of the Self-Defense Forces 
[SDF], circumstances are such that the SDF could "do only as 
much as to collect information within Japanese territorial 
waters."

<F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 24 Mar Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] on 23 
March decided to send a mission of party Diet members, led by 
Vice Chairman Issei Inoue (director general of the party's 
International Bureau), to China for three days from 1 April to 
discuss the issue of nuclear inspections in the DPRK (North 
Korea). Among the coalition parties, the SDPJ is in the unique 
position of being the only party with connections to North 
Korea, through the Workers Party of Korea [WPK], and it wants to 
probe for a "dialogue-based" way of resolving the issue in 
meetings with Chinese officials. The mission will also conduct 
advance consultations on party General Secretary Wataru Kubo's 
visit to China in May. 
  Kazou Watanabe, director of the party's General Affairs 
Bureau, and Hajime Fukada, director of its Organization Bureau, 
are other members of the mission, and they are due to meet with 
such key Chinese officials as Liu Shuzheng, head of the CPC 
International Liaison Department, and Zhu Liang, former head of 
the department. 
  When the SDPJ met, Chairman Tomiichi Murayama spoke about 
the 
tense situation over the nuclear inspection issue on 22 March, 
and emphasized the importance of dialogue, saying, "We should 
refrain from immediate economic sanctions, and should try to 
resolve the mater through dialogue." 
  At the party planning conference held the same day, the view 
emerged that "the government should continue efforts to find a 
breakthrough in the situation by resuming Japan-DRPK talks" and 
"Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to China with 
sanctions against North Korea in mind is a de-facto failure." 
  Meanwhile, on 23 March, Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the 
Japanese Trade Union Confederation [Rengo], urged the SDPJ to 
make diplomatic efforts, and expressed the hope that Murayama 
"will work on North Korea -- through the WPK -- to accept 
international opinions." 
  The SDPJ is expected to confirm, at a meeting of the Central 
Executive Committee on 24 March, that it wants to work with the 
other coalition member parties to resolve the issue through 
dialogue.

Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] Chairman Murayama 
touched on the issue of the DPRK's rejection of nuclear 
inspections. He said: "The party has to keep its friendly 
relations with the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK]. However, as a 
member of the ruling parties, we have to study what the party 
can do." In this way, he disclosed a plan to fully study what 
the party should do, including the possibility of holding talks 
with the WPK.

way, he indicated the SDPJ will make its official view on the 
issue clear early next week. He also stressed: "The SDPJ is 
the sole Japanese political party that has maintained a 
relationship with the Workers' Party of Korea in North Korea and 
the relationship has a long history. As one of the coalition 
partners, however, the SDPJ is in the position of shoring up the 
coalition government." He also suggested the SDPJ, in its 
official view, will press North Korea to accept all nuclear 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

  [Text] Speaking on the issue of the DPRK's suspected 
development of nuclear weapons on 25 March, a top leader of the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] said: "When Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa visited China, the Chinese Government 
indicated that it was desirable to settle the issue gradually 
like the effects of taking Chinese herbal medicine. Our party's 
position is almost the same as China's." In this way, the top 
official indicated the party understands China's position which 
places emphasis on settling the issue through continuous 
dialogue. He then indicated a cautious attitude toward UN moves 
toward sanctions, saying: "Even if the United Nations imposes 
sanctions, they are not always effective in settling issues. 
Nations cannot help having mixed feeling when urged to listen to 
what other nations say." 
  The top official reiterated the party will come up with its 
own measures to deal with the issue by the end of this month, in 
preparation for an SDPJ delegation's visit to China on 1 April. 
However, regarding the possibility of making direct contacts 
with the Worker's Party of Korea, the top official noted: 
"Since it is a matter of convenience, we cannot visit Pyongyang 
without making advance arrangements." Furthermore, the party's 
current standpoint as a member of the ruling parties is 
different from its former position as an opposition party.

  [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] has decided to 
establish a "Joint Council on Northeast Asian Affairs" within 
the party to discuss ways to deal with the tense situation in 
the Korean peninsula resulting from North Korea's alleged 
nuclear development. This council will be composed of concerned 
divisions, such as national defense and foreign affairs. At its 
first meeting scheduled to be held on 30 March, officials from 
various ministries and agencies--including the Foreign Ministry, 
the Defense Agency, and the Finance Ministry--will report on the 
current situation and other matters. The LDP also intends to 
work out measures for Japan to take in case the UN Security 
Council decides to initiate economic sanctions against North 
Korea, and to propose these measures to the government. 
  Discussions will be mainly held on such issues as: 1) 
whether 
it is proper to prohibit North Koreans residing in Japan from 
sending money to North Korea, and 2) what the government should 
do if U.S. forces stationed in Japan ask for the Self Defense 
Force's [SDF] assistance in the transportation and supply of 
fuel. 
  Regarding sanctions against North Korea, Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa said: "If sanctions should be applied, Japan 
will cooperate with the United Nations as much as possible 
within the boundary of its constitution." However, according to 
a senior official of the LDP national defense division, there is 
a skeptical view within the LDP that "it is questionable whether 
the coalition government can provide enough cooperation because 
it contains the Social Democratic Party of Japan which considers 
the SDF unconstitutional."

  [Text] Information has circulated among people familiar 
with Japanese-North Korean relations that "a promising oil 
field" has been discovered in the eastern sea, east of the 
Korean peninsula. However, the Japanese Government and 
industries concerned are uncertain whether it is true. Also, 
details, such as the exact location of the oil field and the 
amount of oil deposits, are unknown. 
  A government source said that in light of the facts that the 
world has increased its suspicion of the DPRK's nuclear 
development program and that relations between the DPRK and the 
international community remain strained, "this could be a part 
of North Korea's information manipulation aimed at dispelling 
domestic concern over possible economic sanctions by the United 
Nations." 
  An influential source, who met with North Korean officials 
between last yearend and early this year, said he was told that 
the DPRK "discovered an oil field" and that Pyongyang planned to 
designate the area as a "special economic zone" and would 
welcome Western nations' cooperation in developing the oil 
field. Another source said the information on the discovery of 
the oil field has circulated in various parts of the DPRK. 
  It is said that the DPRK began oil exploitation in Hungnam 
district in the eastern sea around 1986. It is thought that 
because Russia has discontinued its aid to the DPRK, and because 
China, which is DPRK's most friendly nation, has called on 
Pyongyang to buy oil at internationally traded prices, Pyongyang 
has keenly felt the need to develop energy sources on its own. 
  About a year ago, information circulated that the evidence 
of 
an oil field was discovered in the waters off the east of the 
Korean peninsula. It is said that a Japanese company was asked 
to cooperate in digging out the oil field. However, the matter 
reportedly ended in smoke later on. 
  Sources concerned pointed out that the recent information on 
the "discovery of an oil field" could be "propaganda to uplift 
the spirit of the North Korean people" in view of the fact that 
it has circulated when suspicion of the DPRK's nuclear 
development program is increasing. 
  The Japanese Government has taken a cautious attitude on 
this 
issue. The Natural Resources and Energy Agency said: "We have 
not confirmed that the information is true." Also, on 
cooperation by Japanese firms in developing the oil field, a 
Foreign Ministry source said: "It is impossible at present for 
the government to join in such cooperation."

  [Text] Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP], will have his book New Conservative Revolution 
published in mid-April. In the book, he puts forth his view on a 
realignment of political parties, proposing that members of the 
LDP, the Japan New Party, and Sakigake [Harbinger] with the same 
political belief form two new parties. His book is likely to 
become a sensation because his moves, including his ties with 
Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party], are drawing attention. 
  Commenting on the Hosokawa government, Mr. Watanabe points 
to 
its decision to scrap a plan for the national welfare tax and a 
delay in compiling the fiscal 1994 budget, and then definitely 
says: "The coalition government has no policies and is 
incompetent. Nothing can be done unless it is removed from 
power." In his book, Mr. Watanabe claims that the basic 
political belief will be shared by "politicians who seek public 
popularity" and "other politicians who attach importance to the 
public interest," and then says: "This book calls upon the 
politicians who attach importance to the public interest. I want 
to practice real politics by rallying forces who share my 
political belief and policies." 
  Mr. Watanabe has written the book based on the result of a 
five-year study meeting that has been held by Koji Kakizawa and 
Bunmei Ibuki, members of the House of Representatives and 
bureaucrats. The two legislators will be named coauthors in the 
book. On policies, the book proposes to: 1) streamline or merge 
six government ministries and agencies by pushing for 
administrative reform; 2) introduce a federal system; 3) add 100 
trillion yen to the 10-year basic plan for public investment and 
build a high-speed information network; 4) make Japan's vigorous 
international contributions by reviewing the five principles for 
Japan's participation in UN peacekeeping operations; and 5) 
shift to a single-seat constituency system. The book calls for 
a strong political leadership in Japan to deal with the 
post-Cold War economic and political situation. It shares many 
points with Ichiro Ozawa's book: Blueprint for Building a 
New Japan.

of the ruling coalition parties." 
  His remarks expressed his confidence in the future unity of

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 24 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" informs that the spring session of the 
Great State Hural of Mongolia has completed the consideration in 
first reading of the regulations of the research centre to be 
founded under the jurisdiction of the parliament. The draft 
regulations were drawn up by a special commission. The 
newspaper notes that the research centre under the parliament is 
intended to carry out research work promoting the improvement of 
the draft laws being elaborated and to provide the Great State 
Hural with information required. According to the newspaper, 
the session has charged the standing parliamentary committee on 
meetings and adminstration to work out within the April month 
for submitting for consideration to the Great State Hural the 
proposals on setting up a working group to provide making 
changes and am endments to the election law. The newspaper 
reports that the chairman of the great state Hural N. Bagabandi 
congratulated the population of the country of Kazah descent on 
the occasion of their conventional spring holiday "Nauryz". 
  The "ARDIYN ERH" informs that on the invitation of the 
deputy 
prime minister of the state council, Minister of Foreign Affairs 
of the People's Republic of China Qian Qichen, the Minister of 
External Relations of Mongolia T. Gombosuren would pay an 
official visit to China. The visit is to last from 6 to 11 
April. 
  The newspaper carries an article by chairman of the 
subcommittee of the Great State Hural on struggle with bribery 
and abuses of official position M. Zenee. In the article it is 
stressed that it is the spread of corruption which is the major 
reason hampering the progressive development of any state. M. 
Zenee believes that over a few last years the tendency towards 
widespreading of the corruption and abuses of official position 
is being observed to be characteristic of a number of 
representatives of high-ranking state authority bodies including 
a member of the parliament R. Gonchigdorj. The capital 
newspaper "ULAANBAATAR" continues publishing materials devoted 
to the forthcoming 355th anniversary of the city. In this issue 
the newspaper writes about the creation at the end of the 30s a 
thermo power station in Ulaanbaatar. 
  Such a power station was built under assistance of a German 
AEG firm with the participation of German and Swedish engineers. 
The newspaper underlines that the power station was installed 
with the most modern for that time equipment made in such 
countries as Britain, Germany and Sweden. The power station was 
put into operation in the autumn of 1931. 
  In his article published in the newspaper an academician T. 
Dabaajamts puts forward his ideas aimed at improving the 
conventional Mongolian dwelling ger. [as received] According to

solving the housing problem of the population. 
  The newspaper gives an inverview with the head of the 
veterinary service of the capital D. Baljinnyam who noted that 
according to the results of the census there are more than 266 
thousand head of privately owned cattle. D. Baljinnyam said 
that the vaccination of the cattle population is started in the 
city. 
  He expresses his anxiety about the growing number of stray 
dogs in the capital regarding them to be impeding a serious 
danger for both the residents of the city and the population of 
cattle as well. 
  According to the newspaper, on the initiative of a group 
youth [as received] in the Mongolian capital there has been 
created the first fan club named after the well known rocksinger 
from Great Britain Elton John. 
  Members of the club are planning to celebrate the birthday 
of 
the singer who will be 47 tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Leonard Doyle report: "Satellite Adds to Evidence of North </F>
Korean Bomb Plans"--report is accompanied by a color photo on 
page 1, about 8 inches square, taken in 1986, and a 
black-and-white photo, slightly smaller, on page 15, taken in 
1990, both reportedly satellite pictures of the same site at 
Yongbyon, North Korea] 
  [Text] Analysing commercially available satellite images 
of North Korea, bought for 1,500 pounds each and enhanced by 
computer, researchers at King's College London have found 
evidence of a secret nuclear bomb programme, writes Leonard 
Doyle. 
  A comparison of the above photograph taken in 1986, with one 
taken in 1990--see page 15--shows that a large amount of 
construction work has taken place at a "radiological laboratory" 
at Yongbyon, which US sources say hides a clandestine factory 
for the plutonium needed to make nuclear bombs. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)--which has so 
far refused to use commercial satellite pictures to verify 
whether countries are obeying safeguards under the nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty--has triggered an international crisis 
with North Korea by accepting US spy images as evidence that the 
country has an illegal nuclear programme. 
  North Korea has stopped co-operating with the IAEA and said 
yesterday it would regard the imposition of sanctions over the 
nuclear programme as a "declaration of war". 
  "People have almost no idea what civil satellites can do," 
said Dr Bhupendra Jasani, the researcher who analysed the 
satellite images. "They are now 20 times better than even a few 
years ago and can show an object half a metre across." Military 
spy satellites used by the US and Russia can show objects as 
small as 20cm. 
  Previously unpublished satellite photographs of a secret 
nuclear reprocessing facility in North Korea, where 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors were 
recently blocked as they attempted to take radioactive samples, 
have provided evidence that the country has an active nuclear 
bomb programme. 
  The commercially available photographs which contrast work 
on 
the site in 1986 and 1990 (see photograph, right 
[black-and-white reproduction of 1990 photo]), have been 
obtained by the Independent. They have been enhanced by 
computer and analysed by the Department of War Studies at King's 
College, London, and show that a facility near Yongbyon could 
not possibly be the experimental nuclear reactor dating from 
1965 and a new reactor under construction, as the North Koreans 
claim. 
  The evidence of these photographs coupled with powerful US 
satellite pictures of the site, which remain secret, and IAEA 
analysis appears to confirm that the country can produce the 
bomb. "It is probable that North Korea has enough plutonium to 
manufacture a bomb," said Patricia Lewis of Vertic, the 
London-based arms control treaty verification organisation. 
"The issue now is whether they have the know-how to miniaturise 
a bomb that could be delivered by rocket and threaten Japan as 
well as South Korea." 
  Senior diplomatic sources at the United Nations Security 
Council in New York fear that the crisis with the North Korean 
regime could quickly get out of control. 
  "With more than one million men under arms and 10,000 
artillery pieces and rocket launchers almost within striking 
distance of Seoul we do not want to provoke a psychopathic 
response," one official said yesterday as the Council met to 
hear a report from the Director of the IAEA, Hans Blix. 
  Comparison of enhanced images dating from 1986 (shown on the 
front page) with another photograph taken in 1990, provides 
prima facie evidence that North Korea is engaged in a full-scale 
nuclear bomb programme in violation of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, nuclear arms experts say. 
  The IAEA inpspectors also found circumstantial evidence that 
North Korea is engaged in a clandestine nuclear bomb programme 
on their recent visit. "They saw evidence of continuing 
construction work at the so-called radiological laboratory but 
they could not verify whether or not they were making 
plutonium," said IAEA spokesman David Kydd. 
  US spy satellite photographs shown in secrecy to the IAEA 
prompted the recent inspection of the site. North Korea's 
reaction to the inspection now threatens to become an 
international crisis, with the UN Security Council preparing to 
slap sanctlons on Korea if it does not co-operate. 
  Those images show that a "radiological laboratory" at the 
same site is in fact a single-storey building constructed up top 
of a plutonium reprocessing facility buried deep underground, 
according to nuclear weapons experts. 
  North Korea has angrily rejected US evidence on the grounds 
that it was provided by "the enemy". 
  More evidence was found from analysing nuclear fuel 
processed 
at other North Korean sites that far more enriched uranium has 
been processed into potential bomb-making material than the 
authorities admit to. 
  By computer enhancement of satellite photographs, Dr 
Bhupendra Jasani, a senior research fellow at King's College, 
has been able to show that there are no electricity transmission 
lines coming in or out of the site of a reactor due to come on 
line next year. 
  There are no anti-aircraft, gun or missile sites around 
Yongbyon, but by enlarging the photographs Dr Jasani has 
identified three military airfields as well as a large 
ammunition storage site around the facility.

"Clean Up Your House, Mr Shattuck, Before Telling Us What To Do"] 
  [Text] The U.S. government once again is wielding the big 
stick as the global moral-standard bearer on human rights. 
After castigating countries in Asia and other regions for their 
suppression of political freedom and dissent, Washington is now 
prodding the rest of the world to crack down on sexual abuses of 
women and children. 
  The latest US campaign mounted by Assistant Secretary of 
State for Human Rights John Shattuck should touch some raw 
nerves here in Thailand. This is not so much because Thailand 
is placed on Washington's list of violators where 800,000 young 
people are allegedly subject to sexual abuses -- a figure 
already disputed by Government Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa as 
grossly exaggerated. 
  Rather, the targetting of attack on the under-aged flesh 
trade touches on a sensitive issue known to be close to Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai's heart. It may be recalled that the 
elimination of "rampant" child prostitution was one of the 
cornerstones of the Government's social-policy platform. 
  But although this policy objective was personally advocated 
by the prime minister, the Government appears to have achieved 
little tangible progress after having served 18 months. An 
initial series of police blitz on brothels catering children for 
sex was said to have resulted in some temporary improvement but 
industry experts say child prostitution in general has since 
resumed by taking on new guises. In the meantime, new 
legislation promising tough penalties on procurers and clients 
has been slowcoming. 
  So at the very least, Washington's new campaign should serve 
to re-focus the Thai Government's attention and efforts to 
tackle this pervasive social problem once again. After all, it 
is hardly an enviable position for this country to be placed on 
top of the list of violators -- India, Taiwan, the Philippines 
and Sri Lanka are also accused as the less severe offenders -- 
and this piece of uncharitable news has been broadcast around 
the world. 
  Scathing accusations by American rights groups and 
legislators on the alleged complicity of Thai officials in the 
increasing smuggling of Burmese and Chinese women to serve the 
flesh trade here should, hopefully, also prompt some corrective 
government action. 
  While it is unfair to make generalised accusations against 
the integrity of the Thai police force, corrupt police elements 
extracting gains from illegal gambling dens and brothels around 
the country are a well-known systemic trend. Likewise, the 
wholesale smuggling of females from across the northern borders 
would not have been possible without the collaboration of 
corrupt officials stationed there. 
  In retrospect, it is unfortunate and unnecessary that 
government actions to deal with these glaring social ills should 
have to be prompted by foreign pressures like the sort now 
emanating from Washington. Child prostitution and the smuggling 
of Burmese and Chinese women here are very much Thailand's 
domestic problems that must be dealt with by our own authorities 
without other countries having to tell us what to do or what not 
to do. 
  From Thailand's national standpoint, this also raises the 
larger question of how far this country -- or, for that matter, 
the other Asian countries targetted for the same fault -- should 
tolerate foreign pressures like the Shattuck campaign. 
  First it was several years of threatened sanctions under 
Section 301 of the US Trade Act over allegedly inadequate 
property rights protection. Then there were more threats over 
alleged child labour abuses and the ban on state-enterprise 
labour unions here. After the current attack on under-aged 
prostitution, what will Washington come up with next? When do 
we -- Thailand and other Asian countries which have all along 
been on the receiving end of these pressures -- begin to fight 
back? 
  Whereas governments in the region have the moral and 
political obligation to rid their societies of sexual abuses on 
women and children, it is also time they stand up to question 
Washington's right and legitimacy to set human-rights standards 
for the rest of the world. 
  Should the average Americans be entitled to their basic 
rights to have decent housing and food through employment -- 
something of which a large section of its populace has been 
deprived owing to years of economic policy mismanagement? Or 
should the average New Yorkers be entitled to the rights to walk 
around safely in their city which is notorious for being plagued 
with one of the highest crime rates in the world? 
  The self-appointed world champion of human rights should 
clean up its own house before telling others what to do.

  [Text] Yala -- Paramilitary troopers and police yesterday 
evening clashed with separatist bandits of the Barisan Revolusi 
National at a mountain range in Ban Talowe in Yaha District. 
  The fighting erupted at about the time Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai arrived for an inspection tour of this southern province. 
  No Thai officers were wounded in the 20-minute clash while 
some members of the separatist group, led by Ma Su-ngai Batu, 
were believed to have been hit by gunfire. 
  In downtown Yala, security has been stepped up in areas 
surrounding the Yala Rama Hotel where Mr. Chuan is staying. 
  About 100 cadets of the Ninth Regional Police Academy were 
deployed every 50 meters around the hotel while a van of the 
Interior Ministry which can monitor mobile telephone signals was 
parked in front of the hotel. 
  Police dogs were used to sniff for bombs at the residence of 
the Yala Governor where the Prime Minister is scheduled to meet 
with Muslim leaders of the province.

  [Text] A member of the Pattani Provincial Islamic Committee 
has told Prime Minister Chuan Likphai that tension in the five 
southernmost provinces has been whipped up for political reasons 
with the aim of destabilising the Government. 
  Mr Nilek Sulaiman, also an executive member of the Islamic 
Committee of Thailand, said the prime minister must not be 
confused by developments in the area, which are "politically 
motivated and have political implications." 
  Mr Nilek said he met Mr Chuan by chance on board a plane on 
Friday while on his way to Pattani. 
  The Prime Minister was at the start of a three-day official 
visit to the southern most provinces. 
  Mr Nilek said he told Mr Chuan that tension and confusion in 
the area have been intentionally created. 
  Mr Nilek ruled out reports that the bombing in Hat Yai and 
bombs found on the railway track in Songkhla's Chana District 
are the work of separatists. 
  "They want to stir up more tension in the area, which no 
doubt would have direct impact on the Government," he said. 
  "More tension will be created in the near future." Mr Nilek, 
whose sister is married to Deputy Interior Minister Den Tomina, 
said he thought tension in the area had been created by a group 
of people who want to oust Minister Den. 
  "He has so many enemies in the area and as long as he 
remains 
in his post, tension will be whipped up to discredit him and the 
interior minister," he said. 
  Mr Nilek said the Pattani municipality of which he is a 
member has been put on full alert. 
  "We can't know when they will create more trouble in the 
municipal area," he said. 
  The Muslim deputy rector of Islamic Studies at Prince of 
Songkhla University (Pattani campus), Mr Worawit Balu shared Mr 
Nilek's view. 
  Mr Worawit said he tended to believe that political motives 
lay behind the area's tensions in the past month. 
  "I'm quite sure more trouble will be created in the area," 
he 
said. 
  Many Muslim officials in the region do not believe that 
separatists are directly responsible for tension created in Hat 
Yai, he said. 
  "It may be part of a plot to destabilise the Government. 
Without doubt, tension in the area is aimed at discrediting Gen 
Chawalit and Mr Den," he said. 
  Fourth Army commander Lt-Gen Kitti Rattanachaya yesterday 
briefed Prime Minister Chuan Likphai for 30 minutes on 
counter-terrorism activities in the southernmost provinces. 
Lt-Gen Kitti spoke of the peace talks with key members of 
separatist movements in recent months. A source said Lt-Gen 
Kitti complained of the red tape which prevents local officials 
from taking prompt action when trouble occurs. The efficiency 
of intelligence gathering among government officials was 
discussed. 
  Mr Chuan later told reporters in Pattani that only a small 
group of people are involved in attempts to create trouble in 
the area. He said the situation in the southernmost region is 
not as bad as the press makes out. He has urged local people to 
help the Government tackle the area's problems. 
  Despite the peace talks, anti-terrorist operations will have 
to continue, he said.

  [Text] Speaking to reporters at Bangkok airport this 
afternoon on his return from an inspection tour of the south, 
Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said the repatriation of Cambodian 
refugees could be made after the situation in that country 
returns to normal. The prime minister said: 
  [Begin recording] [Chuan] As a matter of fact, we can bar 
them from entering our country. We must look after them for 
humanitarian reasons. Those carrying arms must be disarmed 
before their entry. 
  [Unidentified reporter] After the situation is safe, do we 
simply send them back? 
  [Chuan] This means allowing them tp cross the border into 
their country. We will not put them on buses and send them home 
because they came here without an invitation. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Chuan] These Cambodians are not permanent refugees. If the 
problem drags on, however, we should coordinate with the UNHCR 
[United Nations High Commission for Refugees] because we might 
be accused of supporting the Khmer Rouge. It is better to have 
outsiders come here to see the problem themselves. The problem 
is not that bad at this point. The refugees will not remain 
here for a long period of time. After the situation is safe, 
they must go. 
  [Reporter] It appears that the Cambodian Government is 
rather 
unhappy with the sudden repatriation of refugees without being 
contacted. The refugees reportedly returned to the areas under 
Khmer Rouge control. 
  [Chuan] We have no right to tell them where to resettle. 
They came here themselves. They have the right to go where 
they want. They are not permanent refugees. If that were the 
case, they would have been taken care of by international 
agencies from the very beginning. If they are going to be here 
for a long time, however, we will have to seek help from 
international organizations. The presence of Cambodian refugees 
has already caused a financial burden to the agencies involved. 
I heard complaints about this last Tuesday. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Chuan] The food supplies they carried with them will last 
only a short time. We will have to feed them later. 
  [Reporter] [Wordsindistinct] 
  [Chuan] They can choose where they want to stay after 
crossing the border. We will not force them to leave. 
  [Reporter] If the UNHCR asks Thailand to keep the refugees 
for an unspecified period, will we... 
  [Chuan, interrupting] We must decide if this is necessary or 
not. [end recording]

  [Text] There was a report from Chanthaburi Province that 
territorial defense volunteers had been deployed along the 
border after yesterday's attempt to push Cambodian refugees out 
of Thailand. The defense volunteers are deployed at Ban Sap 
Tali and nearby villages, and at Ban Phakkat in Tambon Khlong 
Yai, Pong Nam Ron District, the point where refugees were sent 
back. The deployment of defense volunteers was aimed at 
preventing a new influx of refugees as well as to stand by in 
readiness for any trouble that might happen where there is a 
large crowd of people. 
  According to the latest report, exchanges of artillery fire 
were heard sporadically from inside Cambodia. Correspondents 
from Chanthaburi Province reported renewed exchanges of gunfire 
between the Cambodian Government and Khmer Rouge forces. There 
was an intense exchange of about a hundred artillery rounds 
between 2300 and midnight yesterday opposite Tambon Khlong Yai, 
Pong Nam Ron District. Three rounds landed inside Thailand. 
  There was a report that at 1000 today Cambodian Government 
troops clashed with the Khmer Rouge forces opposite Ban Khlong 
Yai in Tambon Khlong Yai. About 400 Cambodian people crossed 
the border into Thailand at Ban Nong Kok, about 10 km from Ban 
Phakkat in Pong Nam Ron District. A Thai marine, however, 
explained that those refugees are the people living along the 
border. They would cross into Thailand whenever there was a 
fighting and return to Cambodia when the fighting died down.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Unilateral Repatriation of Refugees Must Stop"] </F>
  [Text] The government's decision last Friday to forcibly 
return thousands of Cambodian refugees fleeing fighting back to 
Khmer Rouge-held areas is staggering in its insensitivity and 
shortsightedness. 
  Not only does the action completely undermine the Thai 
military's contention that it no longer supports the reviled 
guerrilla group but it has also exposed the country to 
accusations of human rights abuses and international 
condemnation. 
  The reaction from Phnom Penh, with which ties are already 
strained, was swift and not surprisingly bitter. 
  "It is a human rights abuse from some people or Thai 
authorities, and I would like to say clearly that (Cambodia is) 
not happy about this," Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut 
stated on Saturday. 
  Sirivut, who is due in Bangkok today to discuss the 
repatriation, hinted that Phnom Penh would now review earlier 
pledges to extend timber and gem contracts in the Pailin area 
and return seized mining and logging equipment. 
  The foreign minister also called on the "international 
community to look very carefully" at the Thai action and 
Bangkok's refusal to allow the UN or other aid organizations to 
go to the sites where the refugees are being held. 
  The world community, which just last month pledged an 
additional $770 million to rebuild Cambodia, can only be 
expected to react with disapproval to a move that will be 
perceived as prolonging the fighting. 
  The Cambodian army's attack on the former Khmer Rouge 
stronghold coincided with a propaganda offensive by the Thai 
military to convince a skeptic world that it no longer supports 
the guerrillas. Thai military officers who built up close 
contacts with the Khmer Rouge during the resistance war against 
the Vietnamese-backed government in the 1980s, have been accused 
of maintaining and profiting from the relationship after the 
guerrilla group took over the gem and timber-rich border zones 
around Pailin in 1989. 
  Following a call from the United States for Thailand to show 
it had cut its links with the group, the military arranged for 
journalists to tour the border two weeks ago. A second press 
tour of the villages where the refugees had taken shelter was 
arranged on Friday but then abruptly cancelled. Instead, the 
army sealed off the area, denying diplomats, journalists and 
officials from the UN and International Red Cross access to the 
refugees. At the same time reports began to emerge that the 
military had begun repatriating refugees, many against their 
will, despite an agreement with Phnom Penh to discuss and plan 
the return of the Cambodians. 
  In the ensuing news black out, unconfirmed reports claimed 
that the military may have culled out the young and able-bodied 
men among the refugees and repatriated them first by truck, to 
the Khmer Rouge-controlled zone of Phnum Malai. 
  Asked to explain the government's actions, spokesman Aphisit 
Wetchachiwa, cited the long refugee burden Thailand had carried 
and told AFP "we think what we have done is appropriate." 
  If denying refugees, many of whom were not only fleeing the 
fighting but also the Khmer Rouge, international security 
guarantees and forcing them back to areas they fear, can be 
considered "appropriate" neighbourly behaviour it is obviously 
going to take a long time before relations between Thailand and 
Cambodia reach a level of mutual respect. 
  Ever since 1979 when more than 30,000 Cambodians died after 
the Thai military forced them off steep cliffs along the border 
and into mine fields, the lack of respect officials have shown 
for the lives and welfare of Cambodia refugees has been a 
national shame. 
  In a small but telling irony, while independent observers 
and 
international aid agencies were denied access to the refugees 
over the weekend, Thai traders were allowed to profit handsomely 
selling food supplies to the refugees in return for jewellery 
and gold. 
  Once again, the image Thailand has presented to the world 
has 
been of conspicuously sleazy border traders enriching themselves 
under the administration of the military and off Cambodian 
refugees caught up in a murky political game. 
  As of yesterday, many of the refugees were still waiting to 
be sent home. There is still time to admit that the 
repatriation was undertaken with undue haste and to negotiate 
for the Cambodians to return under conditions that are 
acceptable to Thailand, Phnom Penh and the United Nations. The 
decision to send the refugees back was most likely taken under a 
dated Cold War reflex that seems to afflict many of our senior 
foreign ministry and security officials and not out of avarice 
or any intention to keep the Khme Rouge alive. 
  But while some people in Bangkok may believe that as long as 
refugees are being involuntarily pushed into Khmer Rouge-held 
areas, Thailand's blighted international reputation is not going 
to improve.

<F P=106> [Address by Senior General Than Shwe, commander in chief of </F>
the Defense Services, for 49th Armed Forces Day at Resistance 
Park, Rangoon on 27 March -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Senior General Than Shwe, commander in chief of the 
Defense Services, gave an address and said: Today is the 49th 
Armed Forces Day or resistance day, which is a special day full 
of significance for the nation and the Defense Services. At 
this significant armed forces day parade, I would like to 
emphasize to the leaders about the [words indistinct] emerged 
along with the economic endeavor; traditions of the Defense 
services; our present efforts to build political, economic, and 
social conditions with the aim of a peaceful and prosperous 
country; and the efforts to make our Defense Services a skillful 
one to defend our country. Continuing, he said: Comrades know 
that the country was under servitude for over 100 years. Our 
people lost everything politically, economically, and socially 
under this servitude. National pride was degraded. Forty-nine 
years ago, on 27 March 1945, our Defense Services, together with 
the national people, took whatever weapons were available and 
staged a resistance. They sacrificed their sweat and blood for 
the return of our people's political, economic and social 
rights. Armed Forces Day, or resistance day, has been held 
annually to mark that day for the last 49 years in our country. 
He added that the Defense Services, while fighting the 
enslavers to free the nation from servitude and to make the 
country a sovereign state, was founded with the full support of 
the national people. The fundamental spirit and attitude that 
the Defense Services has always upheld since its inception in 
December 1941 until today are: to defend the country and 
interests of the people with its life, and to work for the 
interests of the nation and the people. He said the comrades 
must note that this spirit and attitude are the fundamental 
quality and good traditions of the Defense Services. 
  The commander in chief of the Defense Services continued and 
said: Our country was freed from servitude for over 40 years. 
For over 40 years, our people have been suffering from the pain 
of the internal insurgency that emerged with independence. Due 
to this suffering, our country is not as developed as it should 
be and it lagged behind and (?became poor). Our country has 
good landscape and weather, and has an abundance of forests, 
food, and natural resources. While having the basics to become 
a rich country, our country is poor because of internal 
instability and insurgency. Our country can become a modern, 
prosperous, and developed state if we -- the whole nation -- 
(?discuss) and build the nation in a peaceful and united way. 
  He then said: Due to historical responsibility, the Defense 
Services took state power on 18 September 1988. The whole 
nation knows that our Defense Services dutifully and honestly 
controlled the country when disturbances and uprisings were 
going on all over and the country was on the verge of collapse. 
Besides our original responsibility of defense and security, we 
have to shoulder the responsibility of restoring peace and 
stability in the country and to modernize and develop the 
country. The comrades know that this is why the Defense 
Services are trying to build the nation and work day and night 
with good intentions and goodwill for the utmost betterment of 
the country even as it takes responsibility for the country. 
The comrades have also seen our country's improved political, 
economic, and social conditions. 
  Continuing, he said: Our country's situation is one where we 
are at a crossroad. While the country's old system has stopped, 
the country's new system has not exactly emerged yet. At 
present, there are two responsibilities to be carried out for 
the emergence of a peaceful and modern country. They are: 
national reconciliation [two preceding words rendered in 
English] and the emergence of a new constitution. Continuing on 
national reconciliation, the commander in chief said the 
fighting among our national people has been going on for over 40 
years since our independence. We all are relatives and brethren 
national people, so the killing and bloodshed should be enough 
by now. He said: Seek repentance. See the wrong and make it 
right. For the sake of the country and the people, repay the 
historical debt. We see that while the country possesses the 
basics to become rich, it is poor due to disunity, fighting, and 
killing among one another. During this time -- while we are 
taking responsibility for the country -- we, with the good 
intention and goodwill and with the aim of building a modern and 
developed state together with all the people in a peaceful and 
united way, have discussed, coordinated, and invited the armed 
organizations in the jungle to return to the legal fold. Due to 
the invitation, 10 armed organizations in the jungle, which 
understood our goodwill, have returned to the framework of a 
peaceful political system. They are working hand in hand with 
us to implement development programs in the states and we have 
achieved considerable success. 
  He then added: Some armed organizations are still holding 
discussions with us. At the same time, some groups do not 
understand our genuine goodwill and sincere overture. Some 
groups are conspiring to exploit the situation politically and 
militarily by saying that we are offering peace because we are 
facing political crisis and we are weakening. We, however, are 
still patiently waiting for them to return because these groups 
still hold on to old political ideas and ignore the development 
of the country. They are only working for the interests of their 
own group or party. 
  Continuing, Than Shwe said: Peace overtures were made not 
because we are facing a political crisis nor are we weakening. 
You must understand that national reconciliation is 
indispensable and for this reason we are making the overtures. 
This is not only the responsibility of the Defense Services, 
but it is also the historical duty of the national people and it 
must be carried out today. 
  Another point is the responsibility and effort to draw up 
the 
constitution. While there must be national unity for the 
emergence of a stable and developed country, it is also 
necessary to have a constitution. The comrades also know that 
we, on the one hand, have been inviting the armed groups in the 
jungle to return to the legal fold; on the other hand, we have 
organized and held the National Convention to successfully draw 
up a constitution by organizing the delegates from all social 
strata -- workers, peasants, intelligentsia and technocrats, 
etcetera -- and parties and organizations in the country. 
Today, the National Convention has laid down the basic 
principles to draw up a constitution and it is being held with 
momentum. He addedd: You must not forget the responsibility 
with which we, with good intentions and goodwill, must work up 
to the stage where the country is governed peacefully by the 
forming the organs in accordance with the constitution that will 
emerge. 
  Continuing, the commander in chief of the Defense Services 
said: While carrying out these two political responsibilities, 
we are also working for the development of economic life -- 
welfare of the national people etcetera. We are also 
transforming from the former Central Plan Economy [three 
preceding words in English] -- Socialist Economic System -- to 
the present Market Economy [two preceding words in English]. 
The freedom to do business and trade is also granted. Our 
national people are allowed to do business and trade and live 
freely depending on their caliber and skill. The right to 
freely control a legal business and one which does not affect 
the major interests of the country are also granted. These are 
implemented to facilitate the economic transformation which will 
be suitable to the new country to emerge in the future. While 
we are carrying out the political transformation on one side, we 
also are carrying out the suitable economic transformation on 
the other side. For the transformation of economy, we are 
working on private sectors and also creating an atmosphere for 
the public sectors to boost the country's economy. Due to 
today's position, our country has to base its economy on 
agriculture. We have to develop our country Targeted and based 
on agriculture. That is why, to [words indistinct] the comrades 
are participating in irrigation works to develop our nation's 
economy, which will be based on agriculture. Our country has to 
base its economy on agriculture and gradually develop other 
areas. While the country is not in a position to become an 
industrialized nation overnight or to become a rich nation, the 
country must base its economy on agriculture, which is favorable 
to our country and will gradually transform it into a modern and 
developed nation. He also said that comrades have to 
participate energetically and enthusiastically in agriculture, 
which is the basis for our country's economy, and in other 
nation building programs. He added: Comrades, after building 
good political and economic foundations, the country will have 
good foundations for establishing a peaceful, modern, and 
developed state of the future. The comrades should understand 
that we, with genuine goodwill, are working day and night on 
political and economic matters during this transitional period 
to avoid getting into trouble due to frequent political and 
economic instability and to allow a new government -- whoever it 
may be -- to govern peacefully, prosperously, and with stability. 
  The commander in chief of the Defense Services said: The 
comrades know that we all are trying to build our country into a 
modern and developed state. To defend our country and to 
perpetuate national sovereignty until the end of time, there is 
a need for a strong and skillful Defense Services. It is an 
inevitable responsibility to build a strong and skillful Defense 
Services to secure and defend our country. He said: As 
physical materials are indispensable for the Defense Services to 
be strong, the spirit of the comrades is also very important. 
He then said spirit and discipline are the lifelines of the 
Defense Services. The comrades must have a spirit of not giving 
up easily and a spirit to discharge duty with responsibility. 
The three national causes -- nondisintegration of the union, 
nondisintegration of national solidarity, and perpetuation of 
national sovereignty -- are the belief and pledge of our Defense 
Services. Our Defense Services have to [word indistinct] these 
national causes. The Defense Services have to be build upon the 
training, leadership, welfare, and spirit to become strong and 
skillful. Only then, will the units and comrades have the five 
essential qualities -- spirit, discipline, loyalty, unity, and 
efficiency. He told the comrades not to forget that they can 
defend the country only when they have these qualities. 
  In conclusion, he solemnly urged the comrades to observe the 
good traditions of the Defense Services; to carry out dutifully 
the national political responsibility, which is being shouldered 
by the Defense Services; to participate in the all-around 
development of the nation's economy; to strive for a strong and 
skillful Defense Services to protect and defend our country in 
accordance with the motto -- the nation will have strength only 
when the Defense Services have strength; and to observe the code 
of conduct of soldiers.

  [Text] Rangoon, March 26 (AFP) -- Burma's best-known 
comedian, Zargana, has been released after four years in prison 
as a political dissident, neighbors of his family said Saturday. 
  Zargana, 33, who trained as a dentist but turned to comedy, 
gained prominence for his satirical jokes aimed at the former 
socialist regime. 
  First arrested briefly as a political dissident in late 
1988, 
he went to jail for the second time in 1990 while helping his 
mother in her campaign for the May general elections that year. 
  Neighbors who spoke to Zargana on Friday said he had been 
delivered to his parents' home by military intelligence 
personnel just before noon. 
  He was the latest political prisoner released by the 
military 
junta, known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council 
(SLORC), which has set free more than 2,000 dissidents in the 
past two years.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The Group of 15 [G-15] summit conference due to be 
held in New Delhi last December had to be postponed. However, 
it is heartening to know that postponed event has started this 
week. Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and the 
foreign minister, Datuk Ahmad Badawi, are both in New Delhi. 
This fact does underscore Malaysia's commitment to the 
objectives of the Group of 15. 
  In the context of fast-moving events in our world today, a 
gathering like the Group of 15 is a firm necessity. This aspect 
of globalism is always being stressed by Dr. Mahathir. There is 
no doubt whatsoever that Malaysia will continue to play a 
leading role in this group. Some critics were skeptical about 
the postponement. It had even been rumored that the New Delhi 
meeting might be called off. Malaysia does not subscribe to 
such negative attitudes. A specific idea that was conceived by 
the Malaysian prime minister and worked on in detail by a team 
of officials concerns the establishment of centers of 
excellence. The New Delhi gathering will deliberate on this 
innovative concept. 
  The need to sustain and spread education of high quality is 
widely acknowledged. For the countries of the South, this is a 
crucial sector. Malaysia's plan to start such centers in 
suitable places should receive a positive response from the 
other states that are attending the New Delhi meeting. 
  The past few years have witnessed the steady strengthening 
of 
the South awareness. New lines of communications have been 
established. They can confidently forecast that the leaders will 
review several issues of global concern. They will also map out 
strategies toward coping with numerous areas of human endeavor. 
A new wave of confidence in certainly in evidence as far as the 
South countries are concerned. Their determination to lessen 
dependence of the North has begun to produce concrete results. 
Malaysia itself is a good example of the new South. It has 
succeeded in becoming a highly diversified economy. By the year 
2020, Malaysia will be a fully industrialized nation. 
Therefore, there is no longer any need for the smaller and 
poorer nations to run to the affluent West for guidance. It is 
better, in everyone's long-term interest, to interact as much as 
possible with other member states of the South. 
  In this connection, the New Delhi meeting is expected to 
study the present UN set up. Concrete proposals will probably 
merge for reforming the UN system. Drafted in the aftermath of 
the Second World War, the UN Charter reflects the power 
positions and the ambitions of the victorious nations in 1945. 
The entire international system is in need of change to 
accommodate the needs of the numerous nations of the South. 
  Whatever one chooses to call it, the New Delhi meeting will 
be yet another step forward for the South. Malaysia will give 
the South the fullest support.

  [Text] The prime minister, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir, says 
bilateral relations and cooperation between Malaysia and Vietnam 
over the past few years have brought positive results to be 
proud of. Bilateral trade between the two countries, which 
stood at 235.4 million ringgit in 1991, had increased to 473 
million ringgit in the first nine months of last year. Speaking 
at a dinner hosted for the visiting general secretary of the 
Communist Party of Vietnam, Mr. Do Muoi, in Kuala lumpur last 
night, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said many Malaysian companies had 
ventured in Vietnam. As such, the Vietnamese Government should 
give consideration to these companies, which should help in its 
economic growth, by further awarding them projects. He also 
pointed out that Southeast Asian countries should resolve 
problems among themselves in a peaceful manner while cooperating 
with each other to bring about mutual benefit. Everyone must 
realize the dream of a peaceful, stable, and united Southeast 
Asian region.

  [Excerpt] Kuala Lumpur, Tues. [22 March] -- Malaysia and 
Singapore today signed the Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) on 
the multi-million ringgit [RM] Second Crossing Project scheduled 
for completion in 1997, to further spur economic growth in both 
countries. 
  The new link -- a high-level box-girder 2 km bridge -- will 
connect Johor's proposed new township in Gelang Patah to Tuas in 
Singapore. Ninety percent or a length of 1.6 km to 1.7 km of 
the bridge will be built by Malaysia and the remainder by 
Singapore. 
  There will be a dual three-lane carriageway under the 
integrated development package which will cost Malaysia about RM 
1.6 billion and Singapore S$ [Singapore dollars] 400 million (RM 
680 million). 
  The Malaysian side of the project has been privatised while 
the Singapore Government will undertake its side of the project. 
  Malaysia's package is divided into three components 
comprising the construction of the bridge, the two connecting 
expressways and the development of the Gelang Patah township. 
These have been awarded to United Engineers (M) [Malaysia] Bhd 
[Berhad -- private company] under a concession agreement. 
  Upon completion, Malaysia will introduce the open toll 
system 
for those using the new link whereas Singapore has yet to decide 
if it would do the same. 
  At present, the only link by land between both countries is 
the causeway connecting Woodlands and Johor Baru. 
  "When completed, the new link and ancillary facilities on 
both sides of the Straits of Johor will help spur economic 
growth as well as alleviate traffic congestion at the existing 
causeway and surrounding roads," Works Minister Datuk Leo Moggie 
said at a joint Press conference at Carcosa Sri Negara today. 
  Earlier, he represented Malaysia in signing the IGA with 
Singapore's Acting Minister for National Development and Senior 
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Lim Heng Kiang. [passage

  [Text] Butterworth, Tues. [22 March] -- Malaysia will 
consider sending additional soldiers to join the United Nations 
Protection Force (Unprofor) in Bosnia-Herzegovina if requested 
to do so by the UN, Armed Forces chief Jen [General] Tan Sri 
Borhan Ahmad said today. 
  However, he said, there had been no proposal yet to despatch 
extra peacekeepers to the war-ravaged country. 
  So far, Malaysia's contribution in Unprofor was sufficient 
alongside the participation of soldiers from several other 
countries, he added. 
  He told this to reporters after launching the 13th Air 
Thamal 
(Thai-Malaysia) joint exercise between the Malaysian and Thai 
air forces at the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) base here. 
Malaysia has sent about 1,500 soldiers to join the UN 
peacekeeping force in response to the atrocities committed by 
Serbs on Muslims in Bosnia. 
  Ten RMAF aircraft, including five F-5E jets and three OV-10 
reconnaissance planes, are taking part in the exercise, an 
annual series held on rotation between the two countries to 
strengthen cooperation in operational procedures.

  [Text] Tharman Shanmugaratnam committed a series of 
security breaches which gave private sector analysts an 
opportunity to obtain secret information, the Attorney-General 
said yesterday. 
  Mr. Chan Sek Keong noted that the director ot the Monetary 
Authority of Singapore's [MAS] economics department had handled 
a secret MAS report "in a most hazardous way" and failed to 
protect its secrecy. 
  He urged the court not to believe parts of the evidence the 
accused had given in court, saying that it contradicted the 
position he took in a statement to the Internal Security 
Department [ISD]. 
  Opening the prosecution's submissions yesterday, Mr. Chan 
noted that Shanmugaratnam had brought a copy of a secret MAS 
report, which contained the flash estimates, to a meeting with 
Crosby Securities analysts Manu Bhaskaran and Raymond Foo. This 
was a breach of MAS security rules, he argued. 
  The report, he noted, had not been marked "secret". This 
made it more likely that it would not be handled with the 
required care, he argued. 
  It was designed to highlight the flash estimate, had no 
cover 
and was not placed in a file, he said. 
  The only precaution Shanmugaratnam took was to cover the 
report with a piece of paper. 
  He made no other effort to ensure that the paper remained in 
place. He also removed the sheet of paper when he referred to 
the report during the meeting. 
  Mr. Chan noted that Shanmugaratnam had argued in court that 
it did not make any difference whether the document was put in a 
file or covered with paper. He had said he saw no reason why 
secret documents should not be brought to meetings with private 
sector economists. This reflected his attitude towards security 
rules, said Mr. Chan. 
  Shanmugaratnam had testified that more important than 
whether 
a document was placed in a file or not, was the way it was 
handled. He was confident he would not give away the data as he 
did not expect to be careless, he said. 
  Taking issue with this, Mr. Chan said it was not clear how 
anyone could "expect not to be careless". 
  He added that Shanmugaratnam's explanation that he had 
brought the report to the meeting to refer to the unclassified 
data in it, showed that he was more concerned about having a 
useful reference than the need to protect the secret information 
in it. 
  He urged the court to reject Shanmugaratnam's statement that 
he had handled the secret document with more care than other 
government officials. 
  During his day-long submission, he also took up the 
defence's 
argument that all the memos and reports from the Ministry of 
Trade and Industry [MTI] containing the flash estimates that had 
been admitted as evidence had been graded incorrectly or were 
not graded at all. 
  Responding, he said that there was a lower degree of risk in 
these cases than Shanmugaratnam's. Two of these were internal 
memos, while the third, an MTI report, had been stamped secret 
and had a cover, he said. 
  Later, he urged the court not to believe Shanmugaratnam's 
testimony when he said that he now thought it unlikely that 
Bhaskaran had sighted the figures when they met at the MAS. 
  This contradicted a statement he made to the ISD in which he 
said he could not rule out the possibility that Bhaskaran had 
seen the data. This statement, he noted, was made before 
Shanmugaratnam had been charged. 
  The Attorney-General continues with his submissions on 
Shanmugaratnam and the other accused today.

  [Text] The Attorney-General [A-G] yesterday challenged 
Tharman Shanmugaratnam's account of a meeting with private 
sector analysts, saying he could not remember the details when 
questioned by Internal Security Department (ISD) officers two 
years ago. 
  As such, his recollection in court of the events of June 19, 
1992 was based on a hypothetical situation, said Mr Chan Sek 
Keong. 
  He said that Shanmugaratnam's testimony on how he acted or 
handled official documents during the meeting was "given mostly 
in terms of what he would have done instead of what he had 
already done." 
  The A-G made these points while continuing his submissions 
against the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) director of 
the economics department. 
  The accused's statements to the ISD showed that he could not 
remember whether he had taken a draft report containing the 
flash estimate into the meeting with Crosby Securities 
economists Manu Bhaskaran and Raymond Foo. He also could not 
recall if the document was covered during the meeting at the MAS 
building. 
  The A-G said that much of Shanmugaratnam's memory of that 
meeting was recalled for him by his MAS colleague Chan Chia Lin, 
a prosecution witness. 
  He said that when the incident arose, Shanmugaratnam had no 
clear idea of what happened. Two years later, he came to court 
and gave his version of what he said he recalled. 
  This testimony, said the A-G, was based on a "would have 
been" situation. 
  He read out a few excerpts of the accused's testimony in 
court yesterday to illustrate his point. 
  For example, when saying how he handled the draft report 
during the meeting, Shanmugaratnam said. "From the moment I 
placed the report down, it would have been covered. I would 
only have to remove the paper after I lifted it from the table 
to refer to it." 
  The A-G said that except for one answer, all the others were 
on the basis of what "he would have done." 
  "The accounts are expressed in terms of a customary or usual 
behaviour" and cannot refute Shanmugaratnam's admission in a 
statement that Bhaskaran could have seen the figure of 4.6 per 
cent from the draft report.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, March 27 (AFP) -- Cambodian Foreign 
Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut on Sunday strongly protested 
Thailand's "forced repatriation" of Cambodian refugees fleeing 
fighting in the northwest. 
  The Thai military continued sending the 25,000 Cambodians 
back over the border into Khmer Rouge-held territory, but was 
encountering resistance from some refugees who did not want to 
go, according to traders at the border. 
  Phnom Penh had asked Bangkok to allow free access to the 
International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in order to 
determine if the refugees wanted to return to areas controlled 
by the Cambodian government. 
  But the Thai military kept the Cambodians in an area closed 
to outsiders, and has not let foreign aid agencies or 
independent observers interview them. 
  "The Thai authorities have not listened to our request," 
Prince Sirivut said. 
  "I think it is a human rights abuse from some people or Thai 
authorities, and I would like to say clearly that the Royal 
Government ... and the two prime ministers, we are not happy 
about this," Prince Sirivut said. 
  "We think it is a forced repatriation," he added. 
  At least half of the refugees, according to Thai soldiers, 
were repatriated to a Khmer Rouge-held zone following the Phnom 
Penh government offensive against the Khmer Rouge bastion of 
Pailin in northwest Cambodia. Pailin is Cambodia's most 
important mining center for rubies. 
  "It is not normal that the Thai authorities take this 
decision to send 25,000 people without security, with nothing we 
can check," the prince said. 
  "I'm quite disappointed and I asked all the international 
community to look very carefully in this way," he said. 
  "In particular, we have requested the presence of the 
UNHCR," 
the prince said. 
  Sagato Ogata, the UN high commissioner, made, without 
success, an official request Friday to the Thai government for 
access to the refugees, the UNHCR in Phnom Penh said. 
  The refugees began streaming out of Khmer Rouge zones of 
control around Pailin following a government offensive that 
captured the resource-rich area last week. 
  The repatriation was launched Friday night by the Thai 
military and continued Sunday and Monday, a source on the Thai 
side of the border said. 
  According to an unconfirmed report, the Thai military may 
have culled out the young men and the able-bodied and 
repatriated them first by truck, to the Khmer Rouge-controlled 
zone of Phoum Malai, 45 kilometers (28 miles) to the north. 
  Thai troops are regularly accused of aiding the Khmer Rouge 
at the border, an accusation strongly denied by Bangkok. 
  Prince Sirivut said he would still meet to discuss the issue 
as planned Monday with his Thai counterpart in Bangkok, Prasong 
Sunsiri, with whom discussions on the repatriation of the 
refugees had been anticipated. 
  The minister hinted that Thai requests for an extension of 
the March 31 deadline for the return of timber harvested by Thai 
loggers in the Pailin area -- concessions granted by the Khmer 
Rouge -- would be carefully examined. 
  The request was conveyed Tuesday to Phnom Penh by the Thai 
vice minister of foreign affairs, Surin Phitsuwan, who asked for 
the return to Thailand of expensive mining equipment as well as 
cut timber left in place before the advance of government troops.

  [Text] Pailin, Cambodia, March 24 (AFP) -- The fall of 
Pailin to Cambodian soldiers last weekend may mean the end to 
cosy ties between the Khmer Rouge guerrillas and the Thai 
military, General Kieng Sokun said Friday. 
  Standing in a street in the town that had been Khmer Rouge 
headquarters in northwest Cambodia, the general referred to 
allegations -- disputed by Bangkok -- of Thai military 
assistance to the guerrilla faction. 
  "I think the capture of Pailin may signal the end of the 
close, lucrative relations between the Thai military, Thai 
businessmen and the Khmer Rouge," General Kieng Sokun said. 
  The Khmer Rouge financed their guerrilla organization by 
selling gem-mining and logging concessions to primarily Thai 
businesses, many of which were allegedly controlled by or had 
links with the Thai military. 
  Government officers earlier charged the Thai military had 
transported fresh guerrillas along the border to help in the 
recent counter-attack at Anlung Veng, another major Khmer Rouge 
base that the government captured and then lost. 
  Signs of Thai presence were everywhere in Pailin. Road signs 
in both Khmer and Thai languages reminded drivers to "keep 
right" -- Thais drive on the left side of the road -- and logs 
throughout the area bore signs in Thai indicating the quality of 
the wood. 
  Large craters left by the search for gems scarred the area. 
  One general said 85 Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been killed 
since soldiers reached the area March 19, and troops had seized 
more than 100 tons of ammunition, several hundred tons of rice 
and 1,021 weapons and one T-54 tank. 
  General Pol Saroeun, deputy chief of the general staff who 
had arrived by helicopter to move his command post into Pailin, 
said government casualties were light but gave no figures. 
Mines, malaria and water poisoned by the guerrillas were the 
main problems, he said. 
  Unusually heavy rains hampered the troops' progress but also 
provided safe drinking water. 
  General Pol Saroeun said it was premature to think the 
guerrillas were defeated. 
  "Even though the Khmer Rouge will not be able to make new 
money from gems, rubies or selling logs in this area, I think 
the money they have earned already could still help them buy new 
weapons to counterattack us," he said. 
  But another general said the government forces had dealt the 
radical Khmer Rouge a major blow and vowed to hold the 
resource-rich region forever. 
  "If we cannot hold this place forever, we do not deserve to 
be called the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces," General Kieng Sokun 
said as he stood in Pailin's main street outside a luxurious, 
three-story building believed to be a hotel where important 
visitors had been housed. 
  Opposite the hotel was a garden with manicured lawns, 
bouganvilla and assorted ornamental flowers. Down the road was 
a cinema hall and a newly built hospital. 
  There were only several hundred troops in Pailin, but 
General 
Pol Saroeun said there were about 4,000 men around the rebel 
base and the hills along the Thai border to the west. 
  An AFP reporter could hear only sporadic shelling in the 
hills behind Pailin. There was occasional gunfire in the town 
from soldiers shooting in the air in celebration. 
  Soldiers also rode bicycles left by fleeing guerrilla 
families and collected booty from abandoned houses. One group 
leaving the city had a cow in tow, and live chickens and ducks 
were tied by their feet to the soldiers' AK-47 assault rifles.

<F P=106> ["Royal Government Statement on Administering and Developing </F>
the Pailin Zone"; dated 25 March -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] After a number of units of the Khmer Royal Armed 
Forces [KRAF] overcame many difficulties and obstacles to 
recently control the Pailin zone, which is a large and strategic 
position under the illegal administration of Khmer Rouge 
leaders, the royal government has taken many measures including 
making efforts to set up administrative structures to 
consolidate the defense and administration of the Pailin area. 
  Considering the role and importance of the Pailin area in 
the 
fields of politics, psychology, economics, and foreign affairs, 
and in a spirit of high responsibility for the destiny of the 
population in general and of the entire Cambodian people, the 
Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] has decided to make the 
Pailin area a development zone. 
  With this noble goal, along with preparations to organize 
various tasks, the RGC has the honor to issue the following 
official statement. 
  1. Concerning the army officers and men who are currently 
still under the Khmer Rouge leadership, the RGC continues to pay 
attention to their destiny, rights, freedom, and interests, that 
is, by the royal government issuing successive appeals. 
  Therefore, Khmer Rouge officers and men who have been 
dispersed in the Pailin area, please hurry and show yourselves 
to the KRAF and relevant authorities present in the area. You 
will receive attention and protection for your lives, rights, 
interests, position, and role -- the same as the royal 
government has given thousands of former officers and men who 
have awakened and joined the royal government. 
  2. Concerning any compatriots who have been threatened and 
forced by the Khmer Rouge to go with them, the royal government 
is paying considerable attention to your difficult and arduous 
life. Please endeavor to solve the problem in line with the 
royal government's appeal issued on 4 March 1994, namely get in 
touch with the KRAF in order to free yourselves from the grip of 
the Khmer Rouge group. The royal government will set up 
relevant authorities to receive you and organize appropriate 
living conditions for you by legally granting you land and 
housing. 
  3. As for compatriots who have fled to live temporarily on 
the territory of the Kingdom of Thailand, the RGC will directly 
get in touch with the representative of the Royal Thai 
Government to accept you back to the territory of the Cambodian 
motherland. For those compatriots who want to continue living 
in the Pailin area or who want to change to other places, the 
RGC will do all it can to accommodate your wishes. 
  In this respect, the RGC would like to welcome various 
international organizations, such as the HCR [High Commission 
for Refugees] and the International Committee of the Red Cross, 
who have volunteered to provide assistance to the RGC. 
  4. As for Thai companies and investors who signed business 
contracts with the Khmer Rouge group in the Pailin area, the RGC 
would like to solemnly inform them that the RGC will genuinely 
guarantee their interests by recognizing their rights in the 
contracts in the event that the owners of these companies (?put 
forward proposals) to the RGC. The RGC hopes, and is firmly 
convinced, that the royal government will receive a welcome and 
wide support and assistance from national and international 
public opinion for the this noble cause.

Ranariddh

  [Text] Report from the Pailin battlefield on 22, 23, 24, 
and 25 March: 
  I. On 22 March, the invading forces of the communist 
Vietnamese puppets and the two-headed government struggled to 
reach Pailin from the east, that is from Phnum Srang and 
Suosdei, with infantry troops after being heavily attacked for 
many days. 
  II. Here is the situation on the Pailin battlefield on 23 
March: 
  1. Major communications lines of the invading forces on the 
north from Phnum Kon Damrei to Sala Krau were completely cut by 
the people and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] 
with mines and with attacks to cut off many road segments. 
Trucks and tanks were bogged down due to rain. The invading 
forces' supplies from the north were completely cut off along 
the Mongkolborei River, from Kamping Puoy, and from Snoeng and 
Sdau. The invading forces at Sala Krau are running short of 
fuel, ammunition, and food supplies. Troops, therefore, have 
deserted the battlefield and also have been surrounded and are 
constantly attacked by the people and the NADK. They cannot move 
forward or retreat. 
  2. On 23 March, nearly 1,000 soldiers of the invading forces 
who reached Pailin deserted the town partly because there is 
nothing in Pailin. Furthermore, the invading forces were being 
surrounded and constantly fired upon by big and small artillery 
pieces. 
  III. On 24 and 25 March, the new road of the invading forces 
from Suosdei to Pailin was completely disrupted by mines and 
attack groups who cut this road at many places. This road goes 
through dense forest. The invading troops cannot leave the 
road, particularly trucks and tanks. The ground is soft due to 
rain over the past more than 10 days. 
  IV. Two strategic and important roads have been cut: the 
northern road from Phnum Kon damrei to Sala Krau and the 
southern road from Suosdei to Pailin. This is like cutting the 
throat or the arteries of the invading forces, similar to 
cutting National Routes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 in 1971-74, and 
in particular blocking the Mekong River in February, March, and 
April 1975. It is similar to cutting transport roads No. 68 
from Samraong to Anlung Veng in February and in early March 
1994. It is similar to Dien Bien Phu and Stalingrad. 
  V. Communications and transport routes of the invading 
forces have been strategically cut, first of all, by the people 
and the NADK. Along with this, attacking and raiding forces 
have been set up within Pailin perimeter and Sala Krau. Attacks 
have been launched at will against the enemies who are like fish 
caught in traps. 
  Because rats are clever in stealing, bait has been left in 
traps to catch them. They are caught in the traps. Rats 
trapped in cages will die regardless of the movements and 
shrieks they make.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, March 25 (AFP) -- Nguon Non, the founder 
and political editor of the biweekly Morning News was released 
on bail Friday after two days under arrest, he said here. 
  Ngoun Non, who was charged with libel after publishing 
several articles alleging official corruption, was a senior 
official in the cabinet of co-prime minister Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh until he founded his newspaper at the beginning of 
this month. 
  He was the first journalist to be arrested since last year's 
departure of the United Nations Transitional Authority in 
Cambodia. 
  He had been arrested while at the offices of his newspaper, 
one of the most widely read in Cambodia with a circulation of 
30,000, for failing to respond to two separate court summons. 
  The arrest came shortly after an assurance by King Norodom 
Sihanouk that freedom of the press should be guaranteed in 
Cambodia. 
  A new press law is being prepared by the government.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam, 
after receiving an enthusiastic reception from both houses of 
the Japanese Diet Thursday [day as received], delivered a speech 
in a voice brimming with confidence. 
  His speech concentrated on the past, present and future of 
relations between the two neighbors. 
  Led by the speaker of the Lower House, Masako Doi, Kim and 
his wife, Son Myong-sun, entered the Diet hall to a standing 
ovation. He responded with gentle waves. 
  During his 20-minute speech, Kim was interrupted by applause 
14 times. Many Japanese lawmakers nodded with approval when the 
South Korean president emphasized that his country and Japan 
will have to work together for peace and prosperity in the Asia 
and Pacific region. 
  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa sat in his 
assigned 
seat in the Lower House while Doi and other parliamentary 
leaders sat on the right side of the podium and members of Kim's 
entourage, on the left. 
  Kim waved from the podium when all members of parliament 
stood up and applauded at the end of his speech. 
  Prior to his speech, Doi told the president that "Korea was 
the first country in the world to invent metal printing type and 
Japan has learned a great deal of cultural traditions from 
Korea." 
  "Japan's extreme action once created tension between our two 
countries but by looking at our past correctly and reflecting on 
it, we have to restore mutual trust," she said. 
  After giving his speech, Kim chatted briefly with Doi and 
the 
president of the Upper House of the Diet. 
  "President Kim's gait is very strong and full of vitality," 
Doi told the Korean visitor. "We all listened to your speech in 
an exciting atmosphere," she added. 
  Later, Doi led Kim to the upper house president's chamber 
where they met with more than 70 Japanese parliamentary leaders 
and representatives of political parties. Welcoming Kim 
"whole-heartedly," Doi proposed a champagne toast, and Kim 
responded that he was happy and honored to have delivered a 
speech at one of the most well-known landmarks in Asia. 
  South Korean-Japanese relations have experienced 
difficulties 
because of an overemphasis on the past, Kim said. "(but) let us 
work together to open a new era of Korea-Japan relations," he 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam on Friday [25 March] urged more investment in South 
Korea by Japanese firms and vowed to deal with the current trade 
imbalance by actively seeking to expand exports. Kim, at the 
midpoint of his three-day visit to Japan, told Japanese business 
leaders at a luncheon, "though we are greatly concerned about 
the bilateral trade imbalance, we will endeavor to resolve it 
through the positive approach of expanding our exports, rather 
than through the passive approach of restricting imports." 
  Kim is on a weeklong tour of Japan and China to encourage 
east Asian economic cooperation as well as a coordinated effort 
to persuade North Korea to desist with its nuclear brinkmanship. 
The South Korean president sees the hard-line communist 
government of Kim Il-song as not only a military and political 
threat but also "a major impediment to regional exchanges and 
cooperation." 
  Kim sees Asia as "the most dynamic economic region of the 
world" which is "expected to emerge as the main axis for the 
global economy" in future. "We must strive to eliminate any 
obstacle to free trade and economic cooperation so as to promote 
coexistence, shared prosperity and balanced development 
throughout Asia," he said. 
  Expanding upon his November summit with Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa, Kim was optimistic about the two young 
administrations in Seoul and Tokyo. 
  "We have been able to diminish differences between Seoul and 
Tokyo over how to redress our trade imbalance and how to promote 
technological cooperation," Kim said. With regard to the trade 
imbalance that reached 8.45 billion dollars in Japan's favor in 
1993, Kim vowed, "we will work harder to improve product quality 
and reliability and meticulously fulfill delivery and other 
contract terms." 
  Kim was also optimistic that the new initiative for an 
economic partnership, scheduled to hold its first meeting in 
Seoul next month, would serve as "a major vehicle for bilateral 
dialogue and cooperation. 
  Calling his visit to Tokyo a "new catalyst for consolidating 
our forward looking bilateral ties and economic cooperation," 
Kim urged the Japanese business leaders to "actively take 
advantage of the improving investment climate in (South) Korea."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 26 KYODO -- South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam said Saturday he will hold "thorough" talks on the 
North Korean nuclear issue with Chinese leaders during his visit 
to China, Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Kim told Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa during a second 
round of summit talks Saturday that South Korea does not want 
North Korea to become internationally isolated and hopes the 
international community will not move toward imposing sanctions 
against Pyongyang, the officials said. But "the ball is in 
North Korea's court," they quoted Kim as saying. 
  Kim, who is to leave Tokyo later in the afternoon for 
Shanghai, told Hosokawa at the Akasaka Palace that he believes 
China is opposed to North Korea's nuclear armament but that he 
wants to listen to China's position on the matter and hold 
"thorough" discussions with the Chinese leadership, the 
officials said. 
  The president predicted the United Nations Security Council 
will first move toward recommending North Korea to accept full 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and 
to promote dialogue between Seoul and Pyongyang rather than 
immediately deciding on sanctions, according to the officials. 
  Kim said there have not been any unusual moves in North 
Korea 
although military exercises have been held there since February 
3. 
  There has also been no unrest in South Korea regarding North 
Korea's situation, Kim said, citing as an example the stable 
stock market. 
  During the hourlong meeting, Hosokawa and Kim agreed to 
promote bilateral economic relations in an expanded and balanced 
way, the officials said. 
  Kim pointed out that South Korea's annual trade deficit with 
Japan stands at about 8 billion dollars and urged Japan to 
import more South Korean goods. 
  Hosokawa agreed that Japan should make efforts to boost 
imports from South Korea and promote deregulation, but urged 
Seoul to try to strengthen competitiveness, stabilize 
labor-management relations and beef up the environment for 
investment, the officials said. 
  The premier added that Japan wants to support South Korea's 
small- and medium-sized companies, they said. 
  Hosokawa agreed to study Kim's call to send a Japanese 
survey 
team to South Korea to study investment environment there, they 
said. 
  Kim also voiced South Korea's interest in entering the 
Japanese construction market, and Hosokawa replied he will have 
the concerned ministries and agencies study the matter, they 
said. 
  Turning to Kim's proposal to promote cooperation among 
Japan, 
South Korea and China in the environmental, medical and cultural 
fields, Hosokawa agreed to study the proposal through 
working-level talks, the officials said. 
  Kim suggested that the three nations cooperate on joint 
projects concerning environmental problems, in the field of 
modernization of oriental medicine and in their common culture 
based on the use of Chinese characters, they said. 
  Kim told Hosokawa China has shown "positive" reaction to the 
proposal. 
  The president also said his policy of boosting bilateral 
relations with Japan by looking into the future rather than to 
the past is a step away from that of previous South Korean 
governments, and that he believes the majority of the South 
Korean people support such a policy, according to the officials. 
  Hosokawa and Kim also discussed cooperation in the 
ultrahigh-speed information communication field. 
  Earlier in the day, the two leaders held talks over 
breakfast 
accompanied by their wives. 
  Topics discussed during the breakfast included North Korea, 
Hosokawa's trip to China and political reform in Japan and South 
Korea, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 26 (YONHAP) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
agreed Saturday to work together for the economic development of 
the Asia-Pacific region. 
  In their second summit meeting at the official Guesthouse, 
Kim and Hosokawa also discussed the need for their countries to 
jointly cope with the new round of global trade negotiations. 
  The expanded summit was attended by their cabinet ministers 
concerned with economy and trade. The two leaders' wide-ranging 
discussions included the North Korean nuclear issue, expanded 
and balanced bilateral trade and technology cooperation. 
  The two sides also touched on joint projects involving South 
Korea, Japan and China, co-action in the APEC (Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation) forum, and multilateral security 
arrangements in northeast Asia. 
  Seoul and Tokyo agreed to strive for an early resolution of 
the North Korean nuclear issue, including concerted efforts at 
the United Nations Security Council, Kim said in a press 
conference he gave jointly with Hosokawa after the summit. "If 
North Korea changes its attitude even now, South Korea is ready 
to take appropriate steps," Kim said. 
  Kim is to wind up his three-day visit to Japan and leave 
Tokyo for Shanghai Saturday to start a five-day tour of China. 
  Earlier in the day, Kim and Hosokawa had a breakfast meeting 
and reaffirmed their commitment to cooperate on the North Korean 
nuclear problem. 
  They also shared the opinion that China's active 
participation and cooperation are essential for the interests of 
the entire Northeast Asia, said South Korean presidential 
spokesman Chu Ton-sik. 
  Touching on the trade imbalance in his talks with Hosokawa, 
President Kim asked Japan to buy more Korean products and send a 
mission to Seoul to help increase Japanese investment in Korea. 
  Noting the need for increased exchanges between small- and 
medium-sized companies in the two countries, Kim requested that 
Korean firms be allowed to participate in construction projects 
in Japan. Kim also proposed that Korean and Japanese builders 
bid jointly for construction projects in third countries. 
  In addition, Kim proposed that South Korea, Japan and China 
undertake joint endeavors including development of oriental 
medicine, standardization of Chinese characters and formation of 
a Northeast Asian environmental consultative organization. 
Hosokawa said he was agreeing in principle to the proposal. 
  Moreover, South Korea asked Japan to jointly cope with the 
new round of international negotiations on environmental issues.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 26 (YONHAP) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said 
Saturday [26 March] they had agreed on the need for cooperation 
at both the international and bilateral levels to break the 
North Korean nuclear deadlock. Emerging from an expanded summit 
meeting in the Japanese capital, the two leaders said that while 
the nuclear issue affects security in the entire Northeast Asian 
region, they had agreed to keep the door open for a peaceful 
solution through dialogue. 
  Hosokawa, asked what actions his country would take in case 
the U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on North Korea, 
said he preferred not to go into detail. 
  The South Korean president came to Tokyo Thursday on a state 
visit. He held a private summit with Hosokawa on the day of his 
arrival. 
  Saturday's meeting was joined by aides and accompanying 
cabinet ministers. 
  "South Korea and Japan agreed to consult closely with the 
United States and China, to do our best to solve the nuclear 
problem," Kim said at a press conference. 
  He heads for Beijing via Shanghai later in the afternoon, 
where seeking Chinese support in resolving the nuclear issue is 
his key task. "The one thing that's clear is that China, too, 
is absolutely against North Korea possessing nuclear weapons," 
said Kim. 
  "North Korea's nuclear development is a subject of the 
greatest security concern," Hosokawa said. "It's important for 
the international community to deal with North Korea in a 
concerted, firm way. But we also agreed that it's important to 
keep the window open to dialogue." 
  He declined to go into specifics on how Japan might 
participate in U.N. sanctions, "because they are not under 
discussion at the Security Council as of now." 
  Asked about the Japanese stance on South Korea's bid for a 
non-permanent seat at the Security Council, Hosokawa said he is 
studying the matter carefully. 
  On bilateral issues, Kim said the two countries will 
cooperate closely in dealing with any new trade negotiations. 
In tackling the trade imbalance between the two countries, he 
called for enlargement of their trade relations as a solution.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 26 KYODO -- South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam renewed his hope Saturday [26 March] for the visit to 
South Korea by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, a senior 
Imperial Household Agency official said. Kim, before departing 
for China after a three-day visit to Tokyo, extended the 
invitation again to the imperial couple as they bid farewell to 
Kim and his wife Son Myong-sun at the Akasaka Palace, said 
Kiyoshi Sumiya, the agency's grand master of ceremonies. 
  Kim told the couple during the 20-minute meeting that he 
wishes to invite them to visit South Korea at a proper time. 
  During an audience at the imperial palace on Thursday, the 
president officially invited Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko 
to visit South Korea to forge a new future-oriented 
relationship. At that time, the emperor replied the Japanese 
Government would decide on whether he will go to South Korea. 
  The visit by Japan's monarch, however, is still a sensitive 
issue in South Korea, which was under Japanese colonial rule 
from 1910 to 1945. 
  During his stay in Tokyo, Kim urged Japan to work together 
to 
solve North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development 
program, which has heightened tension on the Korean peninsula, 
and stressed the importance of forward-looking bilateral 
relations.

<F P=106> [Joint news conference by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa </F>
and South Korean President Kim Yong-sam with foreign and 
domestic correspondents at the State Guesthouse in Tokyo; Kim 
speaks in Korean with passage-by-passage translation into 
Japanese -- live] 
  [Text] [Unidentified Japanese official] Now, both the 
prime minister and president will field questions from reporters. 
  [Nishijima, YOMIURI SHIMBUN] I would like to ask the 
president: Mr. President, you will soon leave Japan for China. 
What are you going to discuss with Chinese leaders in connection 
with the issue of North Korea's nuclear development? What did 
you and Prime Minister Hosokawa discuss in connection with this 
issue at the second round of summit talks? And, would you 
explain what was agreed and affirmed between you and the prime 
minister on issues other than that of North Korea's nuclear 
development? 
  [Kim] The issue of North Korea's nuclear development was 
high on the agenda of the summit talks, and the prime minister 
and I devoted much time to discussing the issue. As for the 
issue of North Korea's nuclear development, I believe that the 
ball is now in North Korea's court. Prime Minister Hosokawa and 
I agreed North Korea should not be isolated in the international 
community, and it should not become an orphan of the 
international community. The issue of North Korea's nuclear 
development is the most important issue that could directly 
affect peace in Northeast Asia, especially on the Korean 
peninsula. Therefore, I, and the prime minister, agreed that 
South Korea, Japan, the United States, and China should make 
utmost efforts to solve the issue through discussion. I will 
leave for China today. Regarding your question about China's 
attitude toward the issue, I do not think it is expedient to 
predict what attitude China will take prior to my visit to that 
country. What is clear, however, is that China takes a resolute 
position opposing North Korea's development of nuclear weapons. 
I think you are aware of that. 
  [Cho Chung-min, MBC] I would like to ask Prime Minister 
Hosokawa: Mr. Prime Minister, at the summit talks on 24 March 
you said that if the UN Security Council decides to slap 
sanctions on North Korea, Japan will make a responsible response 
to the sanctions within the limits of the Japanese Constitution. 
Mr. Prime Minister, would you specifically explain what 
responsible response means? And, did you and the president 
discuss South Korea's bid for nonpermanent membership, and 
Japan's bid for permanent membership on the UN Security Council 
at the summit talks? 
  [Hosokawa] I would like to answer your first question. You 
asked me to confirm whether, at the summit talks, I said Japan 
will make a responsible response to sanctions against North 
Korea within the limits of the Japanese Constitution if the UN 
Security Council decides to impose them. At the present stage, 
the UN Security Council has not discussed imposing sanctions on 
North Korea and therefore, I would like to refrain from 
answering your question. In any case, I think it is very 
important that countries in the international community unite to 
indicate their solid attitude toward North Korea. At the same 
time, it is also important to leave open the door for dialogue 
with North Korea. President Kim and I confirmed that point. 
You asked about Japan's bid for permanent membership, and South 
Korea's bid for nonpermanent membership on the UN Security 
Council. Japan's bid was not on the agenda of the summit talks, 
but President Kim asked Japan to examine positively South 
Korea's bid for nonpermanent membership. 
  [Unidentified official] The scheduled time is up and I would 
like to conclude this news conference.

<F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at a joint </F>
news conference with ROK President Kim Yong-sam held at the 
State Guesthouse in Tokyo -- live] 
  [Text] I would like to give my remarks first. It is a 
great pleasure to welcome President and Mrs. Kim Yong-sam as our 
state guests this time, following our recent talks in Kyungchu. 
At the current summit talks held following the last talks, we 
were able to have a broad exchange of views in a frank way on 
relations and cooperation between our two nations. 
  As one who is also engaged in reforms, I would like to 
express my sincere respects to President Kim Yong-sam for his 
continuous efforts in carrying out reforms at home with his 
excellent leadership. 
  It goes without saying that to promote development of 
Japan-ROK relations, it is important to further deepen the 
understanding between peoples of our two nations on the basis of 
lessons learned from past history. And, it is based on this 
concept that we have recently decided to provide new support for 
ROK students studying in Japan. 
  To enable Japan-ROK relations to mature further, I would 
like 
to talk with the president on the need for the diversification 
and internationalization of bilateral relations. 
Diversification means promoting exchanges in various fields and 
between the people of various generations. As for 
internationalization, this means that Japan and the ROK should 
promote cooperative relations between our two countries in the 
international community. I believe that with the approach of 
the 21st century, our cooperation in the international community 
will become more and more extensive. And, I feel that through 
such cooperation, we will be able to actually realize that Japan 
and the ROK are two irreplaceable partners for each other. 
  The issue of North Korea's development of nuclear weapons 
has 
now become the most serious concern in Northeast Asia, where our 
two countries are located. We have discussed this issue at the 
current talks, and President Kim and I share the view that it is 
important to settle the issue through close cooperation with 
China, the United States, and other concerned nations. 
  I am convinced that through President Kim Yong-sam's current 
visit to Japan, we have been able to further develop the 
friendly relationship between our two nations. And I believe it 
is important for us to solidify this friendly relationship for 
the future of the peoples of our two nations as a whole, and 
with the president, I would like to do my best for this purpose. 
  Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Statement by President Kim Yong-sam at joint news </F>
conference with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa held 
at the State Guesthouse in Tokyo -- live] 
  [Text] Dear reporters, I, first, thank Prime Minister 
Hosokawa and Mrs. Hosokawa for their warm hospitality and for 
their thorough preparation for our successful visit to Japan. 
  During my visit, I have met with the major Japanese leaders, 
including Prime Minister Hosokawa, and have frankly exchanged 
views with them regarding the direction in which the ROK and 
Japan should move to promote their friendly relations amid 
rapidly changing international trends. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa and I have agreed that both the ROK 
and Japan, as neighboring countries jointly pursuing freedom, 
democracy, and the market economic system, should cooperate anew 
on leading the Asian-Pacific era. Toward this end, both the ROK 
and Japan must establish multilateral friendly relations as soon 
as possible. Also, we have agreed to practically strengthen 
cooperation to promote these relations. 
  Peace and security on the Korean peninsula, located in the 
center of Northeast Asia, are very important in maintaining 
peace and security in that area. For the stability of the 
Korean peninsula, first, North Korea must dispel the suspicion 
of its nuclear development and North-South dialogue must be 
earnestly carried out. 
  Despite our efforts to peacefully resolve the North Korean 
nuclear issue through dialogue, the nuclear issue has been 
finally referred to the UN Security Council because of North 
Korea's insincere attitude. I think it is very regrettable. 
The North Korean attitude is an important factor. If North 
Korea changes its attitude even at this moment, we will take 
corresponding steps. 
  Regarding this, during these talks, the ROK and Japan have 
agreed to further strengthen their close cooperation to 
immediately resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, including 
cooperation in the UN Security Council. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa and I hope that the ongoing reform 
in 
political, economic, social, and all other areas -- both in the 
ROK and Japan - will be successfully carried out, and we are of 
the same opinion that the reform will ultimately consolidate the 
new relations between the ROK and Japan. 
  The conclusion of Uruguay Round negotiations and the 
beginning of the new world economic order are expected to 
aggravate the trade competition among countries. 
  In the recent talks, the ROK and Japan have agreed to make 
joint efforts for continuous development of Asian-Pacific 
economic cooperation and to closely cooperate with each other to 
cope with the new trade round [saeroun tongsang raundue 
taeunghame issoso]. 
  We also agreed to break the trade imbalance between the two 
countries and try to restore balance by expanding economic 
relations through close economic cooperation. 
  The two countries also promised to make joint efforts to 
further develop mature [songsukan] ROK-Japanese relations, which 
began to ripen last year, with the inauguration of the ROK 
civilian government and Prime Minister Hosokawa's ROK visit as 
momentum. 
  If the ROK and Japan deepen mutual trust for the bright 
future with a correct understanding of these promises, the road 
for a good-neighbor relationship will open wide. 
  Next year will be significant because it will mark the 30th 
anniversary of the normalization of ROK-Japanese diplomatic 
relations. I expect the peoples of the two countries will make 
efforts to further mature ROK-Japanese relations on this 
occasion. 
  I am sure my visit to Japan will serve as an important 
turning point in establishing mature ROK-Japanese relations 
extending toward Asia and the world. 
  Thank you.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 26 KYODO -- South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam said Saturday it is "imperative" that Japan and South 
Korea work to end North Korea's isolation and halt its suspected 
nuclear arms program. 
  In a joint press conference with Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa after a second round of summit talks, Kim said that 
South Korea and Japan share a common interest in developing 
economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Peace and security on the Korean peninsula are essential to 
stability in the region, but vestiges of the Cold War still 
linger on the peninsula, Kim said. 
  Kim stated that it is "imperative that neighboring countries 
work together toward making North Korea discard its isolationist 
policy." He also said it is "imperative that North Korea give 
up its suspected nuclear arms development program and return to 
the South-North dialogue." 
  Reporting his agreement with Hosokawa on economic 
cooperation 
in the East Asian region, Kim noted that both sides agreed the 
lopsided bilateral trade imbalance must be resolved. 
  The president ends a three-day visit to Japan Saturday 
afternoon, leaving for Shanghai for talks with Chinese leaders. 
  Kim said it was "the insincerity of North Korea that brought 
about the referral" of the nuclear issue to the United Nations 
Security Council. 
  "Measures should be taken in accordance with the North's 
attitude," the president said, suggesting a flexible stance 
toward Pyongyang. 
  Hosokawa stressed the need for a firm and unified response 
of 
international society to the issue while leaving open a window 
for dialogue with North Korea. 
  The president, in his meeting with Hosokawa on Saturday [26 
March], said that instead of suddenly imposing sanctions on 
North Korea, countries should begin by calling for the 
inspections and promoting the resumption of inter-Korean 
dialogue. 
  "I hope we don't follow the path of isolating the North," 
the 
officials quoted him as saying. 
  Kim told Hosokawa that he was aware that Pyongyang had 
conducted some military exercises on February 3, but added that 
there did not appear to be anything unusual in the current 
situation in North Korea. 
  Hosokawa, speaking on bilateral trade issues, said he would 
do his best to redress the current trade imbalance and will 
consider the dispatch on an investment study team to South Korea.

North Korea's alleged nuclear arms program and Seoul's growing 
trade ties with Beijing. 
  Kim and his wife Son Myong-sun concluded a three-day visit 
to 
Tokyo where the South Korean president urged joint efforts to 
persuade Pyongyang to give up its nuclear ambitions and stressed 
the importance of future-oriented bilateral relations.

<F P=106> [Roundtable "Discussion" program with Nobuo Matsunaga, </F>
government representative and former ambassador to the United 
States; Keio University Professors Masao Okonogi and Tomoyuki 
Kojima; Kan Indoku, chief of the ROK Far East Affairs Institute, 
in Seoul; Larry Nikshu, member of the U.S. Congress Research 
Bureau, in Washington; and William Taylor, deputy chief of the 
U.S. Strategic International Affairs Institute, in Seoul -- all 
identified by caption, moderated by NHK commentator Takashi 
Yamamoto and reporter Sato] 
  [Excerpts] [Yamamoto] Mr. Matsunaga, do you think the 
situation involving North Korea has returned to that of a year 
ago when it announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT], or has the situation worsened? 
  [Matsunaga] As you know, tension in the world has now eased 
following the end of the Cold War. However, there are conflicts 
and disputes in various regions, and tension is now growing in 
certain places. I have the impression that tension on the 
Korean peninsula is mounting. While North Korea retracted its 
announcement on the withdrawal from the NPT, it took coercive 
actions. For this reason, I think the tension is now growing as 
compared with the situation a year ago. However, we should not 
lose our hope even under such circumstances. [passage omitted 
on remarks by other participants] 
  [Yamamoto] Mr. Taylor said that North Korea is just engaging 
in its conventional diplomatic policies as it has done before. 
Mr. Matsunaga, why do you think North Korea rejected inspection 
of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency? 
  [Matsunaga] I think the country is trying to display its 
diplomatic power by hinting at the possibility of its developing 
nuclear weapons. We need to consider why North Korea is trying 
to do so. I think its top priority task is to secure its 
existence and development. I believe that, to that end, it 
intends to make utmost use of the suspicion of its nuclear 
development program. The international community probably 
thinks North Korea's nuclear capability itself -- when assumed 
that the nation possesses nuclear arms -- is not relatively 
large. However, even if a nuclear weapon is a single-shot one, 
it will produce an unfathomable impact if it is used. For this 
reason, North Korea's suspected nuclear development involves 
danger. What is most important is that a certain 
misunderstanding or other factors will not serve as an impetus 
to the outbreak of some incidents. To that end, I think Japan, 
South Korea, the United States, China, and Russia need to make 
additional efforts to persuade North Korea to dispel suspicion 
about it. [passage omitted on remarks by other participants] 
  [Yamamoto] We do not understand well why North Korea is 
trying to develop nuclear arms. What do you think of it? 
  [Matsunaga] Mr. Okonogi stated earlier that he had thought 
North Korea was playing for time. I still believe it is just 
playing for time in view of its serious economic situation. 
While the political situation in North Korea is not reportedly 
bad, its economic situation is very serious. I have no choice 
but to say North Korea's economic power is rapidly declining in 
the East Asian region. Its greatest concern probably is to 
secure its existence. In that sense, its leaders have a feeling 
of crisis now. They think it will take much time to overcome 
this sense of crisis. Moreover, it is said that a change of 
power will take place in North Korea from Kim Il-song to Kim 
Chong-il. In this sense, North Korea is in a transition period. 
I think this is one of the reasons why they feel a growing sense 
of crisis. Then, why do they have to prepare themselves for the 
change while feeling a sense of crisis? Well, Russia, China, 
the ROK, and Japan are North Korea's neighboring countries. Of 
them, Russia and China have nuclear weapons. Japan and the ROK, 
although they do not have nuclear weapons, are under the 
American nuclear umbrella. Therefore, I am of the opinion that 
the North Koreans think that there is great danger that this 
tension will continue to grow and eventually explode somewhere 
unless they do something about it. 
  [Yamamoto] What does the international society have to do to 
deal with North Korea if that is the case? 
  [Matsunaga] As Mr. Taylor has pointed out, I think that 
primarily, North Korea has to make its existence known to the 
international society and to seek development while cooperating 
with the international society. But, the North Korean leaders 
may be feeling that they do not have a chance to do that. I am 
sure they realize that the nuclear weapons development is not 
beneficial to North Korea at all. However, we can explain the 
current situation only from the viewpoint that they feel a sense 
of crisis. 
  [Sato] I think that the ROK, although the United States 
withdrew its nuclear arms from there, feels that it is still 
under the U.S. nuclear umbrella. The DPRK-USSR trade accord is 
actually invalid. It still has a trade agreement with China. 
Do you think North Korea feel unsafe in this situation? 
  [Matsunaga] I do not think it does. North Korea cannot 
count on Russia, former Soviet Union. Its reliance on Russia is 
rapidly decreasing. China is the only remaining partner. I 
think, however, the North Korean leaders do not want to be 
placed completely under China's protection. I think they want 
to have a free hand. 
  [Yamamoto] Now, I would like to move to the issue of how the 
issue of North Korean nuclear weapons will develop. Various 
negotiations are being held at the UN Security Council. 
Reporter Sato will explain how the things may develop. 
[passage omitted on Sato's explanations and remarks by other 
participants] 
  [Yamamoto] Mr. Matsunaga, Japan and the ROK agreed at the 
summit talks that Japan, the ROK, China, and the United States 
have to cooperate to break the current deadlock. What role can 
Japan play in such a situation? 
  [Matsunaga] As has been pointed out, I think it is correct 
for Japan, the ROK, and the United States to cooperate with each 
other to find out North Korea's true intentions. However, it is 
true also that China is the biggest influential power. This is 
very important in terms of two viewpoints. First, North Korea 
is in confrontational ties with Japan, the ROK, and the United 
States, although its ties with each of the three countries 
differ slightly. In this sense, Japan, the ROK, and the United 
States are not friendly countries to North Korea. However, 
China is different. It has ties of friendship and trust with 
North Korea. Therefore, China has the strongest persuasive 
power. 
  Second, North Korea is relying 100 percent on China for 
energy, which is indispensable to the North Korean economy. In 
this sense, China has a trump card. Therefore, I think it 
wields the strongest persuasive power. As Mr. Okonagi said, 
China's prestige will go up if it uses this trump card to change 
North Korea to act in a reasonable manner. The important thing 
is that we need to support China. I think Japan needs to think 
about cooperating with China. 
  As for the UN response to North Korea's suspected 
development 
of nuclear weapons, I think that discussions at the United 
Nations or the Security Council will have significant effect in 
terms of generating public opinion in the international 
community. Its policies are isolating North Korea in the 
international society. Its isolation is not beneficial at all to 
the international society as a whole. We need to bring it back 
to the international society. I think China has major 
influential power to do that, too. Therefore, Japan needs to 
assume the stand of supporting China. 
  [Yamamoto] You mean that Japan needs to work with China, 
right? 
  [Matsunaga] Yes, I mean to work with China. 
  [Yamamoto] As we discussed earlier, the UN Security Council 
will gradually introduce necessary measures to deal with North 
Korea. How do you think Japan should respond if the Security 
Council asks it to join in economic sanctions against North 
Korea? 
  [Matsunaga] Fundamentally speaking, Japan has to support 100 
percent and cooperate with the United Nations if it decides to 
impose sanctions against North Korea. However, the reality is 
that we have to go through many steps before that. I also think 
there is a limit to the effect of sanctions. Therefore, I am of 
the opinion that we should not rely on sanctions alone. It is 
important for us to make efficient use of peaceful approaches, 
such as discussions and the persuasive power. [passage omitted 
on remarks by other participants] 
  [Yamamoto] Mr. Matsunaga, it seems that Japan will be forced 
to make difficult decisions and be asked, depending on the 
situation in the future, to cooperate with the United Nations in 
military actions. What do you think of this issue? 
  [Matsunaga] Japan is a U.S. ally. It made it clear that it 
would fully support and cooperate with the United States. But, 
it has to avoid the possibility of sending wrong signals to 
North Korea. On the other hand, Japan also fully supports the 
ROK's stance. I think we should continue to do that. 
  On the other hand, we hope for true peace and stability on 
the Korean peninsula. To realize that, Japan and North Korea 
need to normalize their diplomatic ties first. We started 
negotiations for normalization of diplomatic ties between the 
two countries. But, the North Korean officials walked out of 
the negotiations two years ago. Needless to say, they have to 
take Japan's economic power into consideration. I think it is 
very important for North Korea to decide, on the basis of cool 
judgment, to return to the negotiation table for normalization 
of diplomatic ties. I think China hopes that, too. 
  [Yamamoto] The time is up for us. Thank you very much for 
joining in this program.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 28 KYODO -- Japan voiced tacit support 
Monday [29 March] for China's proposal for a soft nonbinding 
statement at the U.N. Security Council urging North Korea to 
accept full nuclear inspections. Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko 
Saito told a news conference, "not a single country believes 
it's appropriate to take measures that could escalate things 
rapidly to a high stage (of urgency)." 
  Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States last 
week conferred privately over a draft resolution. 
  The U.S. has proposed a resolution urging North Korea to 
agree to follow-up inspections of its nuclear facilities within 
one month. The resolution does not call for sanctions but leaves 
room for "further action if necessary." 
  China, which is eager to keep open the door for dialogue 
with 
North Korea, says it is too early for such a step. China 
suggested Friday that the Security Council issue a nonbinding 
statement in the name of its president, Jean-Bernard Merimee of 
France, which unlike a resolution could be adopted by consensus 
rather than by vote. 
  Saito said Tokyo expects the 15-member Security Council to 
take measures "most suitable at this point, as many members have 
the same awareness of the problem as we do." Noting that "the 
aim is to make North Korea change its policy and not to take 
punitive action," Saito said Tokyo does not "object" to the 
dialogue approach. 
  As a permanent member China holds the power of veto, which 
it 
is likely to use if the council calls for tougher action such as 
economic sanctions against its longtime ally North Korea. 
  South Korea's Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Sunday 
before adopting resolutions China's proposal "may be effective." 
  Concerning direct talks between Japan and North Korea, Saito 
said Tokyo would positively respond if Pyongyang signaled 
interest in such talks, which "it does not seem to have."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- More than 70 percent of 
the young Korean people in Japan surveyed last summer said they 
feel a sense of attachment toward this country, the Korean Youth 
Association in Japan said Friday [25 March]. The association 
affiliated with the pro-Seoul Korean Residents Union in Japan 
suggested in the report that the younger generation of Koreans 
born in and living in Japan consider their permanent residency 
here as a matter of course. 
  The results of the report were brought to the public's 
attention as South Korean President Kim Yong-sam visits Tokyo, 
stressing the importance of future-oriented relations between 
the East Asian neighbors. 
  Many Korean youth living in Japan today are descendants of 
Koreans forcibly brought to this country under its harsh 
colonial policies before and during World War II to labor in 
Japanese factories and mines. After the war, many retained 
their Korean nationality and today an estimated 700,00 Koreans 
are living throughout Japan as permanent residents. 
  The survey conducted between June and September last year 
polled 800 Korean young men and women between the ages of 18 and 
30 who were born in Japan but hold South Korean citizenship. 
The results were released in February. 
  In addition to the more than 70 percent who said they felt a 
sense of attachment to Japan, more than 50 percent of the survey 
respondents also said they felt a sense of attachment to the 
Korean community in Japan. 
  Roughly 40 percent said they felt attachment to South Korea, 
while less than 10 percent had similar feelings of attachment 
toward the Korea of old before it was divided following World 
War II. 
  In response to a question about returning to Korea, just 
short of 30 percent of the respondents said they wished to 
return while another 30 percent said either Korea or Japan would 
be fine. More than 40 percent of the respondents, however, said 
they had no desire to return to Korea. 
  Of the young people surveyed who had visited South Korea, 
more than 40 percent said they felt a sense of attachment to 
their ancestral homeland while visiting, while 30 percent said 
they had "mixed feelings" and 20 percent said they felt 
indifferent.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 28 KYODO -- The Democratic Socialist 
Party (DSP), one of the seven ruling parties, Monday [28 March] 
pledged to work toward gaining for Japan a permanent seat on the 
U.N. Security Council (UNSC). In its political platform for 
fiscal 1994, the DSP declared it would push for permanent 
membership in the 15-member council as well as give its 
wholehearted support to U.N. operations, including peacekeeping 
activities. 
  The DSP also called for amendments in the Self-Defense 
Forces 
Law to institutionalize the SDF's contributions to U.N. 
peacekeeping operations as its main or sub-main task. The 
platform will be formalized at a party convention in April, 
party officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- A quarter of the 13,768 
Indochinese "boat people" who reached Japan between 1975 and 
March this year are Vietnamese who settled permanently under a 
screening system abolished this month, the Justice Ministry said 
Friday [25 March]. Japan did away with its special treatment of 
Indochinese refugees on March 4 in line with an international 
agreement on the screening system. 
  Vietnamese boat people arriving in Japan in the future will 
receive the same treatment as any other arrival. 
  Of the 13,768 boat people who landed since May 1975, when 
Vietnamese refugees first arrived, 3,416 are Vietnamese who 
opted for permanent settlement, officials said. The ministry 
said that in the same period 3,498 Chinese nationals posing as 
Vietnamese refugees also arrived in Japan, although their 
numbers have fallen off in recent years. 
  Other Vietnamese have gone to third countries to settle and 
those posing as refugees have been forcibly repatriated. 
  A June 1989 international conference on Indochinese refugees 
adopted the set of special screening measures to determine 
whether they qualified for refugee status. But with subsequent 
changes in Vietnam, a conference in February elected to revise 
the measures, and Japan's cabinet gave its approval to abandon 
them as of March 4.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 27 KYODO -- Japan's major commercial 
banks will provide full-scale long-term loans for China in 
collaboration with international lending organizations to 
develop the country's infrastructures such as power stations and 
petrochemical facilities, the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN said Sunday. 
  Local affiliates in Hong Kong of six major banks -- Fuji 
Bank, Sanwa Bank, the Bank of Tokyo, Sumitomo Bank, Mitsui Trust 
and Banking Co., the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan -- will take 
part in April in a 380 million dollar joint financing led by the 
Asian Development Bank to the People's Bank of China as key 
members, the business daily said. 
  The six Japanese banks and other foreign commercial banks 
will provide a total of 78 million dollars in cofinancing with 
the 15- year loan. The loan will carry an interest rate of that 
of libor, or London interbank offered rate, plus 0.7 percent, 
the NIHON KEIZAI said. 
  The Bank of Tokyo has also decided to participate in 15-year 
joint loans totaling 470 million dollars initiated by the World 
Bank to the Chinese Government as a key managing bank, according 
to the paper.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 28 KYODO -- China, facing rapidly 
growing domestic demand for crude oil, has joined a Japanese 
trading house in developing oil in Papua New Guinea, officials 
of the Japanese partner said Monday [29 March]. The officials 
of Marubeni Corp. said the project brings together the Japanese 
firm and two Chinese state-run enterprises, China National 
Petroleum and Natural Gas Corp. and China International Trust 
and Investment Corp. 
  Under the present plan, the three partners will engage in 
oil 
development in a concession to be acquired in the central part 
of Papua New Guinea to start commercial production within a few 
years, they said. 
  China became an oil-importing nation last year due to strong 
demand for crude oil resulting from high-paced economic growth. 
  The officials said full-scale production at the oil-rich 
Tarim Basin in northwestern China will not start in the current 
century. 
  In the oil development in Papua New Guinea, they said 
sharing 
of investment estimated at 100 billion yen will be decided later. 
  Most of the oil produced at the concession will be brought 
to 
China for domestic consumption but some of it will be sold 
overseas to earn foreign currency, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 28 KYODO -- Police arrested two 
trading company executives Monday [28 March] on suspicion of 
illegally exporting restricted technology to China, Tokyo 
metropolitan police department officials said. Police arrested 
Norimichi Sugiyama, president of Traders Co. in Chiba 
Prefecture, and Katsuhisa Iida, president of Tokyo-based 
Hightech Co., on suspicion of violating the Foreign Exchange and 
Foreign Trade Control Law by exporting image intensifier tubes 
to Beijing. 
  The technology can be used for military satellites. Exports 
are restricted by the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral 
Export Controls (Cocom), a Cold War-era watchdog set up by the 
western allies to control exports of sensitive technology to the 
East bloc. 
  The Cocom controls are to be abolished at the end of March. 
  The case was uncovered during a police probe of Traders Co. 
and other trading houses which are suspected of being involved 
in similar exports to North Korea, police sources said. 
  Police also arrested three executives of Yokohama Machinery 
Trading Co., which was raided by police in January. The company 
was suspected of making high-tech exports to Pyongyang and 
selling used cars to North Korea. 
  Meanwhile, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI) reported the Chiba and Yokohama trading houses to police 
on charges of violating the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade 
Control Law.

  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa addressed today's 
inaugural meeting of the Administrative Reform Headquarter's 
[ARH] working group to promote imports and said Japan was 
expected to build an open economy and society. Among other 
things, the prime minister stressed the need for deregulation to 
close the commodity price gap between home and abroad. 
  With plans to finalize its voluntary market-opening package 
in late June, the government has now set up within the ARH a 
working group to promote imports, following the earlier 
establishment of a working group to study deregulation in the 
housing and land sectors. 
  At the working group's inaugural meeting held this morning, 
Prime Minister Hosokawa said no one needed to study everything 
that went on during the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks to 
realize Japan was expected to build an open economy and society. 
Promotion of this effort would lead to the correction of and 
reduction in the commodity price gap between home and abroad, he 
added. 
  A specialist from the private sector, who is also a member 
of 
the working group, suggested at today's meeting that to correct 
the price gap Japan should ease regulations which are tighter 
than in most other countries.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 28 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Monday [28 March] called for greater economic 
openness, noting that the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks 
are evidence of increasing calls for Japan to liberalize its 
market. Speaking at a working group meeting on steps to boost 
imports and improve market access, the third such meeting to be 
held under the administrative reform promotion headquarters led 
by the premier, Hosokawa said, "we need to establish an 
economically open society." 
  "Our efforts should contribute to shrinking the differences 
in prices in Japan and abroad," he added, calling for active 
discussion of ways to rectify price differentials. 
  Previous meetings focused on housing and real estate issues, 
and also conferred on information and telecommunications. 
  The Japanese Government is planning to draw up 
market-liberalizing measures based on the discussions of the 
three working groups by late June, ahead of July's Group of 
Seven (G-7) summit. 
  At the working group meeting, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said "drastic measures, not abstract ones," should be 
implemented. 
  Experts from the private sector said that regulations should 
be revised to be more in line with international standards.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- Fears of inflation and 
economic overheating are pushing U.S. interest rates higher 
even as prices remain stable, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) said 
Friday [25 March]. 
  Two recent tightenings by the Federal Reserve Board have 
pushed up short-term rates while worries of overheating boost 
longer-term rates and make Wall Street skittish, the central 
bank said in its monthly report on overseas economies. 
  Fears are emerging about whether the American economy will 
grow at a sustainable pace around 3 percent or whether a recent 
surge will reignite inflation, a BOJ economist told reporters. 
  In Europe, France is beginning to show clear progress in its 
stock adjustments, while Britain remains in a gentle recovery 
led by personal consumption, with employment conditions 
improving and industrial production on the rise, the report 
said. But growing German exports cannot overcome slumping 
domestic demand to put the country clearly on the path of 
recovery, despite production recovery in the former East 
Germany, it said. 
  Gross domestic product in Western Germany fell in the fourth 
quarter after two quarters of gains as worsening employment 
weighed on consumption and delayed stock adjustments depressed 
capital spending, the report said. 
  By contrast, it said that in China such investment in plant 
and equipment continues to fuel strong growth despite 
credit-tightening starting at the end of January to curb 
inflation. 
  South Korea's economy is improving as exports rise, while 
Southeast Asia continues to grow strongly with increasing 
infrastructure spending and growing trade within the countries 
of the region, according to the BOJ report.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 26 KYODO -- The government will unveil 
an "action plan" next week to help foreign companies participate 
more fully in Japanese markets, government sources said Saturday 
[26 March]. The plan will include tax incentives, low-interest 
loans and support in establishing welfare facilities for foreign 
companies operating in Japan. 
  In order to encourage foreign companies to export more to 
Japan or to make more investment in the country, the plan will 
also call for enhancing information provided by Japanese 
organizations. For example, it will call on the Japan External 
Trade Organization (JETRO), which long pushed Japanese exports 
but has recently begun promoting imports, to send its experts on 
trade and investment to 12 cities overseas such as San Francisco 
and Milan. 
  The action plan will be unveiled as part of a new 
market-opening package the government is expected to announce 
Tuesday, the sources said. They said the government will review 
the action plan every year to show its trade partners its 
continued efforts on the matter. 
  The plan for fiscal 1994, starting from April 1, will be in 
line with the government's budget plan, they said. 
  Another feature of the action plan will allow foreign 
companies to carry over losses incurred within the initial three 
years of operation in Japan for a period of 10 years, rather 
than the current limit of carrying losses for seven years, they 
said. 
  The government will also ease within the year conditions for 
providing a government-guarantee of debt for foreign companies, 
so as to make it easier for them to raise capital, the sources 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- The government plans to 
boost the volume of rice distributed through 
government-monitored channels by 89 percent, while increasing 
the total production of table rice by 38 percent in the year 
that starts in November, the Food Agency said Friday [25 March]. 
  According to its basic plan for rice control, the agency 
will 
take various steps, including financial incentives, to encourage 
rice growers to sell rice through the government-controled 
channels instead of selling in the grey market outside the 
government channels, agency officials said. The plan was 
explained to an informal meeting of the Rice Price Council. 
  For the 1995 rice year that starts on November 1, the 
production of rice for table use will be increased 38 percent 
from the previous year to 10.58 million tons, partly by easing 
the policy of cutting back rice cultivation. 
  The government will try to increase the amount of rice 
distributed under its control by 89 percent to 7.38 million tons 
to secure stable supply. 
  The government will also import 379,000 tons of rice in 1995 
to comply with the "minimum access" agreement on the partial 
opening of Japan's rice market reached in the Uruguay Round of 
global trade talks concluded last December under the auspices of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  For the 1994 rice year that runs through October 1994, the 
1993 production of table rice was 7.66 million tons, of which 
3.9 million tons have been or will be distributed through the 
government-approved channels, the agency said. 
  Japan will import a maximum of 2.48 million tons of rice 
this 
year to avoid a possible supply shortfall, according to the 
agency. 
  Rice to be imported by the government for table use this 
year 
is estimated at 1.75-2.15 million tons. In addition, the 
officials said, 330,000 tons of rice will be imported for 
processing.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- Japan's top economic 
planner on Friday [25 March] voiced strong concern over the 
recent sharp increases in rice prices. Rice prices began rising 
last year after a bad harvest and the trend is still going on, 
Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency 
(EPA), told a regular press conference. 
  The uptrend is "very serious," Kubota said. 
  She said the EPA will carefully monitor rice price trends 
and 
take adequate steps if necessary, while keeping in touch with 
the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry. 
  Kubota's comments came following a government report that 
consumer prices of rice in Tokyo rose 7.4 percent in March from 
a month earlier, the sharpest monthly growth in nearly 17 years. 
The price of rice in March soared 19.7 percent from a year 
earlier.

  Jonan Denki Co., which operates a discount store chain in

rice brand harvested in Akita Prefecture, starting on Sunday. 
The company said the agency asked it to call off the plan, 
warning that selling rice without a government license will 
constitute a violation of the Domestic Food Control Law. 
  Toshio Miyaji, president of the company, told reporters he 
has no intention of changing the plan at present.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 27 KYODO -- More than 2,000 people 
lined up Sunday [27 March] to buy brand-name domestic rice at a 
Tokyo store that sold the rice without a license, and at a 
discount, in defiance of the Food Agency. Jonan Denki Co., a 
Tokyo-based electric appliance discount store chain, put some 12 
tons of domestically grown rice on sale at its store in Nishi 
Eifuku and sold out all of it in three hours. 
  The Food Agency repeatedly warned the firm to call off the 
rice sale, saying that doing so without a government license is 
a violation of the Food Control Law. 
  A queue began forming Saturday midnight and more than 2,000 
people lined up over a kilometer before the store opened at 10 
A.M. While selling the rice despite the agency's warning, 
Toshio Miyaji, president of Jonan Denki, told customers through 
a loudspeaker, "we must break the bad law." 
  The customers, mostly housewives, were attracted to the rice 
because it was from Akita Prefecture, northern Japan, one of the 
nation's leading rice producing regions, and because it was sold 
at a discount price of 3,000 yen per five-kilogram package. 
  Jonan Denki limited purchases to one bag per customer. 
  The government has imported foreign rice to make up for 
shortages from last year's poor rice harvest, but since 
February, consumers have queued up at shops selling domestically 
grown rice, despite higher prices. 
  A senior Food Agency official said earlier the agency will 
take "proper action" if Jonan Denki failed to comply with its 
order not to sell the rice. But no agency officials showed up 
at the store Sunday to block the sales. 
  The discount store said it procured 29 tons of rice from the 
village of Ogata in Akita Prefecture and plans to sell remaining 
rice at another store in Tokyo in the near future.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 28 KYODO -- The Food Agency on Monday 
[29 March] showed reluctance to take legal action against a 
Tokyo-based electrical appliance discount chain store which on 
Sunday sold unblended brand-name domestic rice in defiance of 
its instruction to stop the sale. Agency officials did not 
disclose the reason for the apparent reluctance to file a 
criminal complaint with law enforcement authorities. 
  Jonan Denki Co. sold some 12 tons of domestic rice at one of 
its stores in Tokyo without a government license. The Food 
Agency had repeatedly warned the chain to call off the plan, 
saying that selling rice without a license is a violation of the 
Food Control Law. 
  Over 2,000 people rushed to buy the rice, which sold out 
within three hours. 
  The officials said Monday the sale was regrettable, but they 
did not say the agency would file a criminal accusation against 
the company. They said the agency will "persistently continue" 
to instruct Jonan Denki to stop such sales. 
  The discount store said it procured 29 tons of rice from the 
village of Ogata in Akita Prefecture. It plans to sell the 
remaining rice at another of its Tokyo stores next Sunday. 
  The government has imported foreign rice to make up for 
shortages from last year's poor rice harvest, but since February 
many consumers have queued at shops selling domestic rice.

  [Text] Kanazawa, March 26 KYODO -- Yohei Kono, president 
of the leading opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), urged 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Saturday [25 March] to 
resign over a questionable loan from a scandal-tainted trucking 
firm. Kono told reporters Hosokawa must take responsibility for 
the scandal, which has brought to a deadlock Diet deliberations 
on the 73.08 trillion yen state budget for fiscal 1994 which 
starts April 1. 
  The LDP has demanded that Hosokawa submit further detailed 
documents related to a 1982 loan of 100 million yen from Sagawa 
Kyubin Co., the country's leading parcel delivery firm, saying 
materials Hosokawa offered are insufficient to clear suspicions 
over the loan. The opposition has also demanded that Hosokawa's 
former secretary testify before the Diet on the loan issue. 
  The premier has said he borrowed the money to buy a 
condominium in Tokyo and repair his home in Kumamoto Prefecture, 
and he repaid the loan by January 31, 1991. He has reiterated 
there were no illegalities in the loan. 
  Hosokawa last December submitted a memo to the opposition in 
an attempt to clear his name. 
  The Sagawa Kyubin group was embroiled in a money scandal 
involving a number of leading political figures, including 
fallen LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru, who was charged with tax 
evasion last March.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 28 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa may be forced to quit if the Diet remains deadlocked, 
according to a former chairman of the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP), the largest force in the seven-party ruling coalition. 
  "If the (opposition) Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 
persistently refuses to open (Diet) deliberations, there would 
be only two options -- whether only the ruling parties 
deliberate as an extraordinary measure or Hosokawa takes 
responsibility (for the delay)," Makoto Tanabe said in an 
address in Tokyo. The LDP has refused for more than two weeks 
to start deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget, already two 
months behind schedule, until Hosokawa gives a full accounting 
of a 100 million yen loan he received from the scandal-ridden 
Sagawa Kyubin trucking business group. 
  In past Diet sessions, Hosokawa has repeatedly said he took 
the loan to help finance repairs on his residence in Kumamoto 
Prefecture and later repaid it to Sagawa Kyubin's network of 
trucking and parcel-delivery companies. 
  Tanabe also said Hosokawa should not dissolve the House of 
Representatives. He said he should not call an election under 
the current system. 
  The Diet recently passed a package on changing the election 
system, but the bills have not yet taken effect.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who heads Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party], held a news conference in Kumamoto 
Prefecture today and commented on the issue of Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's receipt of a 100-million yen loan from the 
Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin trucking company. He stressed that with 
many difficult tasks piling up, it would not be advisable to 
dissolve the lower house. Hata added that as Prime Minister 
Hosokawa said he had submitted everything he could to the Diet, 
it was important to promptly convene a lower house Budget 
Committee meeting to settle the Sagawa loan issue. Hata then 
touched on the issue of dissolving the lower house and the 
ensuing general election, saying it was not the right time to 
become involved in dissolving the lower house and holding a 
general election because, with the adoption of a new electoral 
system, work had already started on designating new electoral 
districts and many difficult tasks still had to be faced. 
  Meanwhile, Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP], also commented on the Hosokawa-Sagawa 
loan issue during an appearance on a commercial television 
program. He said that if the prime minister continued to refuse 
to submit additional material and rejected demands that his 
former secretary appear before the Diet for questioning, the 
cabinet had to take responsibility. He indicated that unless 
Hosokawa agreed to clear suspicions surrounding the loan, the 
LDP was prepared to force the cabinet to resign en masse or have 
the lower house dissolved.

  [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] held a meeting 
this afternoon of its special committee investigating Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 100 million-yen loan from the 
Sagawa Kyubin parcel delivery group. In the meeting, the 
committee decided to send its members to Kumamoto Prefecture 
next week to investigate whether any illegal transactions took 
place when the prefectural government authorized the 
construction of a major resort facility at the foot of Mt. Aso 
during Hosokawa's term as Kumamoto governor. 
  At today's meeting, the committee discussed ways to promote 
investigation from now on. Noting that Kumamoto prefectural 
government changed its regulations when it authorized the 
construction of a resort facility near Mt. Aso during Hosokawa's 
term as governor, the members agreed that this move was unusual 
and should be investigated. 
  The committee decided to send four members, including 
Committee Chairman Matsunaga, who is former international trade 
and industry minister, to Kumamoto on 31 March. The four will 
interview prefectural officials about details of the regulation 
changes and visit the resort facility in question.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 27 KYODO -- Prosecutors plan to wind 
up their investigation of a series of bribery scandals involving 
major contractors with an indictment of former Construction 
Minister Kishiro Nakmura, prosecution sources said Sunday [27 
March]. Top prosecution officials will hold a meeting Monday to 
approve the plan, the sources said. 
  The Tokyo District Prosecutors Office will then indict 
Nakamura on Tuesday on charges he received a 10 million yen 
bribe from giant contractor Kajima Corp. in January 1992, the 
sources said. 
  The former construction minister has reportedly remained 
silent during questioning by prosecutors since he was arrested 
March 11. The money Nakamura allegedly accepted was apparently 
intended as a reward for using his influence as a Diet member to 
help stop the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) from filing an 
accusation against a cartel of 66 contractors, including Kajima, 
over bid-rigging in Saitama Prefecture. 
  At the time, Nakamura was the deputy chief of the special 
committee on Antimonopoly Laws of then governing Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP). He left the party after his arrest. 
  Since last June, two prefectural governors, two mayors and 
more than 20 executives of eight leading contractors and a paper 
manufacturer have been indicted in connection with the 
influence-peddling scandals on public works projects. 
  The contractor scandals came to the surface after the 
arrest of retired LDP powerbroker Shin Kanemaru in March 1993. 
Kanemaru is standing trial on charges of evading roughly 1 
billion yen in tax on some 1.8 billion yen in undeclared income, 
chiefly provided by contractors. 
  Prosecutors have apparently given up filing a criminal 
charge 
against scandals involving Seiroku Kajiyama, a powerful LDP Diet 
member, and former Posts Minister Hideo Watanabe for want of 
evidence. 
  A suspicion had emerged that Mitsui Construction Co. gave 10 
million yen to the Kajiyama camp in 1991 to gain his influence 
in winning a public works project contract. However, a Mitsui 
executive, who should have delivered the money, has testified he 
pocketed it himself, the sources said. 
  Kajiyama, former justice minister and former LDP secretary 
general, denied the allegation and sued the ASAHI SHIMBUN, which 
reported he received the money. 
  Prosecutors have confirmed Watanabe received 40 million yen 
from Kajima from 1988 to 1991 in connection with a hotel 
development project in central Tokyo, the sources said. But 
they failed to discover any specific request Kajima made to 
Watanabe, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's bid to establish a joint parliamentary group among 
the seven coalition parties is rapidly picking up momentum, 
coalition sources said Friday [25 March]. Two interparty policy 
forums on foreign affairs and education will soon be set up, a 
move aimed at accelerating Hosokawa's attempt to establish a 
policy study group, believed to be a preliminary step before 
forming a seven-party joint parliamentary group, the sources 
said. 
  Three key coalition figures -- Hosokawa, Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito 
Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa -- held talks on March 13 and 
agreed to launch the study group with a view to the forming of a 
new party, the sources said. 
  They are eyeing setting up as early as April a seven-party 
study group which could ultimately develop into a new party 
after absorbing the two forums and establishing a parliamentary 
group, they said. 
  The seven coalition components remain divided over how to 
fight off the leading opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 
in the next general election for the House of Representatives. 
The LDP, which was ousted from power last August, still retains 
the largest number of seats in the Diet of any single party. 
  The next general election is expected to be held under a new 
electoral system mixing single-seat constituencies and 
proportional representation. 
  Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito, both core 
coalition parties, are advocating the necessity of uniting the 
seven coalition parties to defeat the LDP. 
  The Social Democratic Party (SDP), which is the largest 
member of the coalition bloc, the new party Sakigake [Harbinger] 
and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) are in favor of a 
multi-party system. The SDP and Sakigake are opposed to 
Hosokawa's plan to establish a joint parliamentary group among 
the seven coalition parties. 
  Hosokawa, head of the Japan New Party (JNP) which is closely 
tied with Sakigake, has recently tilted heavily in favor of the 
Shinseito-Komeito line, coalition sources said. 
  Earlier this month, Hosokawa said the coalition would be at 
a 
disadvantage in the next general election unless it overcame 
internal rivalry and agreed to back a joint candidate in each of 
the 300 single-seat districts. 
  Hosokawa is expected to dissolve the next House of 
Representatives for a snap general election some time before the 
four-year term of the incumbent lower house expires in July 1997.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- Common policies will be a 
major precondition for parties to promote electoral cooperation 
and aim at victory in the next general election for the House of 
Representatives, a key figure in the ruling coalition said 
Friday [25 March]. 
  Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, one of the 
seven coalition parties, told a press conference that common 
defense and energy policies are particularly important. 
  Ichikawa's remark alluded to policy differences between the 
Buddhist-backed Komeito and the largest party in the coalition, 
the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which has long been opposed 
to the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] and nuclear power plants. 
  Ichikawa, who along with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, is viewed as a key coalition 
strategist, urged the SDP to break away from its longstanding 
basic stance that the SDF is unconstitutional and that Japan 
should promote development of safer energy sources as a 
substitute for nuclear power stations.

  [Text] Kanazawa, March 27 KYODO -- A candidate jointly 
backed by the ruling coalition narrowly won the gubernatorial 
election in Ishikawa Prefecture, central Japan, on Sunday [27 
March], defeating a candidate supported by the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  The election was a crucial test for Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa because it was the first gubernatorial election fought 
between the seven ruling coalition parties and the LDP since the 
Hosokawa government took office last August, throwing the LDP 
into opposition after 38 years of unbroken rule. 
  Former Vice Gov. Masanori Tanimoto, 48, was backed by the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP), Komeito, Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party], the Japan New Party (JNP), the Democratic Socialist 
Party (DSP), new party Sakigake [Harbinger] and the United 
Social Democratic Party. Tanimoto defeated LDP-backed Hiroshi 
Ishikawa, 51, a former House of Councillors member, and Japanese 
Communist Party-backed Takashi Shimizu, 51, a doctor. 
  The election was held to fill the post vacated following the 
death of Yoichi Nakanishi. 
  Tanimoto garnered 283,992 votes while Ishikawa had 275,854 
votes and Shimizu 47,624 votes as of 10:50 P.M. with 98 percent 
of the votes counted, Election Administration Committee 
officials said. The officials said 70.9 percent of some 887,000 
eligible voters turned out. 
  During the election campaign, Hosokawa and LDP President 
Yohei Kono both visited the prefecture to canvas for votes. 
  The election was regarded as a prelude to a House of 
Councillors election next year, and the next general election, 
as well as a litmus test of election cooperation among coalition 
parties in a single-seat electoral district. 
  The Diet has enacted a package of political reform bills to 
replace the current multiseat constituency system for the lower 
house with the combination of single-seat district and 
proportional representation. 
  The implication of the election result is expected to give 
an 
impetus to a coalition move to create a new party to fight 
jointly against the LDP in other elections, political analysts 
said. Shinseito and Komeito have advocated merging coalition 
partners into a single party, while the SDP, Sakigake and the 
DSP call for a "moderate multiparty system." 
  The governor's race was also seen as a proxy war between 
Keiwa Okuda, chairman of the lower house steering committee and 
a key member of Shinseito and LDP Secretary General Yoshiro 
Mori. Both Okuda and Mori have been elected from the No. 1 
constituency in the prefecture.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 28 KYODO -- Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) President Yohei Kono on Monday [28 March] slammed the 
government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for its perceived 
failure to tackle a number of pressing political tasks. 
Speaking at a lecture, Kono pointedly criticized Hosokawa's 
abortive tax hike plan that would have replaced the current 3 
percent consumption tax. 
  Stating that the Hosokawa administration has raised doubts 
about its political capability since its formation last summer, 
the LDP chief also said the government should be blamed for the 
long delay in the Diet debate on the fiscal 1994 state budget. 
The delay is due largely to the government's decision to 
postpone customary year-end budget formulation until early this 
year, Kono said. 
  Kono also demanded that Hosokawa come clean on a 
questionable 
loan he allegedly received from a scandal-tainted trucking firm. 
  Kono is the first LDP president who has failed to become 
prime minister in nearly four decades. Under the LDP rule that 
ended last August, the post of party chief automatically carried 
the premiership because of the party's majority strength in 
parliament.

  [Text] Kanazawa, March 25 KYODO -- Former Finance Minister 
Ryutaro Hashimoto predicted Friday [25 March] that a row over 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's alleged role in a money 
scandal will lead to dissolution of the House of Representatives 
and a general election. Hashimoto, chairman of the Policy 
Affairs Research Council of the opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP), said the row over the alleged scandal is 
threatening the passage of the fiscal 1994 budget program. 
  Diet business has been stalled, leaving the 73.08 trillion 
bugdet in limbo, by the LDP's demands that Hosokawa release more 
data about a loan he says he received from Sagawa Kyubin Co. in 
1982. The LDP says it will continue to refuse to open budget 
deliberations until Hosokawa meets its request.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- Japanese banks will beef 
up their risk and subsidiary disclosure system from the coming 
March book closing in line with proposals made Friday [25 March] 
by a Finance Ministry panel. The proposals were made in an 
interim report compiled by a disclosure study group under the 
Financial System Research Council, an advisory panel to the 
finance minister. 
  The report calls on financial institutions to improve their 
disclosure periodicals, featuring recommendations to start 
disclosing operational results at securities and trust banking 
subsidiaries and to upgrade explanations of risk managements. 
  A Finance Ministry official, briefing reporters, said the 
Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan is to revise its 
disclosure standard based on the report for its members that 
virtually covers all private banks in Japan. 
  It will start with their business results for the current 
fiscal year ending March 31, the official said. 
  Under the banking law, private banks are required to publish 
the disclosure periodicals every year, and they follow the 
standard decided by the federation. 
  While urging further improvements in disclosing information 
on subsidiaries on a consolidated basis by parent banks, the 
report stresses the need for securities and trust banking 
subsidiaries to offer their own operational results. 
  "The significance of disclosure (at such subsidiaries) is 
great because of their importance in management strategy (of 
parent banks) and their large scale (compared with other 
subsidiaries) and operational divergence with the parent 
financial institutions," the report says. 
  Banks were allowed to enter securities and trust banking 
businesses through subsidiaries in April last year under 
financial system reform. 
  The Finance Ministry official said disclosure at those 
subsidiaries will include earnings and assets. But the 
recommendations are limited to domestic subsidiaries, and the 
report leaves disclosure of overseas subsidiaries for further 
study due to "diverse business fields and scale." 
  On risk management, financial institutions are urged to make 
"easy-to-understand explanations" of their strategies and 
systems on interest rate, credit and other risks, thus upgrading 
from the current disclosure limited to their awareness of risks 
and management of assets and liabilities. 
  But the report calls for further study on implementation of 
a 
numerical measurement of risks while closely following the 
effects of "explanatory disclosure" and the ongoing 
international discussions on such risk-management benchmarks. 
  The ministry official said the panel will set up a working 
group on the issue. 
  Meanwhile, the report urges banks to make the disclosure 
periodicals more "convenient and easy to understand" since they 
are offered primarily to depositors at branch offices.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- Japan's "hidden debt" -- 
borrowings not included in budgets as the nation's official debt 
-- will amount to 38.7 trillion yen by the end of fiscal 1994, a 
Finance Ministry official said Friday [25 March]. 
  The latent debt must somehow be funded in the future, said 
Kazuhiko Takeshima, deputy director general of the ministry's 
budget bureau. Fiscal 1994 ends in March 1995. He was replying 
to questions in the Finance Committee of the Diet's House of 
Representatives. 
  The debt includes 26 trillion yen in borrowings from 
Japanese 
National Railways Settlement Corp., and unspecified sums from 
local governments and from government-sponsored medical 
insurance programs, Takeshima said. Such debt results mainly 
from deferred regular fund allocations in budgets, and the 
ministry has been using this technical accounting method in 
budgets over the past years to avoid issuing deficit-covering 
bonds amid tough revenue conditions. 
  In the fiscal 1994 budget package, now awaiting Diet 
deliberations, the ministry is to issue some 3 trillion yen 
worth of deficit-covering bonds to finance planned tax cuts, but 
is also using the method to avoid excessive bond issuances. 
  Meanwhile, the outstanding balance of official national 
long-term debt is estimated to reach 261.8 trillion yen at the 
end of the new fiscal year, Takeshima said. He said 201 
trillion yen is from issuances of government bonds, and the rest 
is borrowings mainly from the special budgetary account on 
postal savings. 
  He said the balance of local government bonds is expected to 
reach 77 trillion yen.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 28 KYODO -- Japan's prolonged 
recession apparently discouraged manufacturers from building new 
production facilities in 1993, with construction of new 
factories decreasing for the fourth straight year, a government 
report said Monday [29 March]. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said 
corporate acquisitions of land for new factories in 1993 
decreased 33.8 percent from the year before to 1,634 cases, the 
lowest since 1979. 
  The total tract of land acquired for new plants also dropped 
28.7 percent to 2,290 hectares, the ministry said. 
  The ministry said the report was based on a survey of 
corporate purchases of land for new factories, covering 1,000 
square meters or more. 
  Citing another survey conducted last fall on capital 
investment plans, the ministry predicted the sluggish trend will 
continue in 1994. 
  The ministry said land acquisitions decreased in most 
regions 
covered in the survey.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 26 KYODO -- Sakura Bank Chairman Yasuo 
Matsushita is tipped as the most probable candidate to succeed 
Yasushi Mieno as the governor of the Bank of Japan (BOJ), 
informed sources said Saturday [25 March]. Mieno's four-year 
term as governor of the central bank is due to expire December 
16. 
  Matsushita, 68, joined the Finance Ministry in 1950 after 
graduating from the University of Tokyo. He served as vice 
finance minister, the ministry's highest post for bureaucrats, 
for two years from June 1982. 
  Matsushita became president of Taiyo Kobe Bank after leaving 
the ministry and has been serving as chairman of Sakura Bank 
since April 1990, when the bank was set up through a merger of 
Taiyo Kobe Bank and Mitsui Bank. 
  The sources, however, added some senior officials of the BOJ 
and the Finance Ministry have strongly recommended Yoshihiko 
Yoshino, 63, president of the Japan Development Bank, as Mieno's 
successor. Yoshino was also the former vice finance minister 
from 1986 to 1988. 
  Former vice finance ministers and career BOJ officials have 
taken turns serving as BOJ governor for the past five terms. 
Mieno, who entered the central bank in 1947, assumed the BOJ's 
highest post in 1989 after serving as vice governor. 
  The sources also said the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) is 
likely to name Mitsuhide Yamaguchi, currently president of the 
Export-Import Bank of Japan, as its next president. They said 
the TSE's current president Minoru Nagaoka, who will complete 
his second three-year term in May, will discuss the appointment 
with the Finance Ministry and leaders of the securities industry 
early next week. 
  After approval by TSE member companies, Yamaguchi's 
appointment will be formally decided at the stock exchange's 
general meeting May 25, they said. Yamaguchi, 66, started his 
career in 1951 at the Finance Ministry and served in such 
positions as director general of the budget bureau before 
becoming vice finance minister in 1984. 
  If Yamaguchi accepts the offer at the TSE, he will be the 
fifth former vice finance minister in a row to serve as its 
president. 
  After resigning from the ministry in 1989, he served as the 
head of the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund before moving on 
to the Ex-Im Bank as president in May 1990.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- Friday's [25 March] 
planned 24-hour strike was called off shortly after midnight 
Thursday when major private railway unions reached agreement 
with management on an average 3.94 percent wage hike. The 
unions agreed to accept a benchmark monthly wage increase of 
11,400 yen, or 3.94 percent, calling off a planned daylong 
strike as part of Japan's "spring labor offensive." 
  Union representatives issued an order to cancel the 
threatened strike at 1 A.M. Friday. 
  The package also includes an annual bonus of 5.4 months 
worth 
of salaries. 
  Because of the midnight accord, 12 railway companies 
operated 
their train runs without any interruption Friday morning and bus 
services by nine private companies began from the start of the 
day on schedule. 
  Parties to the agreement include railway companies Tobu, 
Tokyu, and Keisei, Teito Rapid Transit Authority, Keio Teito, 
and Sagami railway in the Kanto region centered on Tokyo. 
  Among other railway firms covered by the agreement are 
Nagoya 
railroad in the Chubu region centered on Nagoya, the Hankyu, 
Hanshin, Keihan, and Nankai railway lines in the Kansai region 
centered on Osaka and Kyoto, and the Nishi Nippon Railroad in 
Kyushu. 
  The Transport Ministry had predicted that over 22 million 
people would be affected in Tokyo and other major Japanese 
cities if the strike took place.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 26 KYODO -- A ministry study panel 
will call for improving the telecommunications network systems 
of 288 local prefectures, cities and villages, ministry 
officials said Saturday [25 March]. 
  The study body, attached to the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications, will file an interim report later this month 
calling for a redesign of the local networks under the "Neo 
Teletopia Project." 
  Under an upgraded version of the 1983 "Teletopia Project," 
all local areas will eventually be integrated into a nationwide 
network. 
  The Telecommunications Council, an advisory panel to the 
posts minister, has discussed the development of an optical 
fiber information network, officials said. 
  The Neo Teletopia Project is preparing for Japan's next- 
generation telecommunications network in the age of multimedia, 
which will require vast data-processing resources. 
  Under the current Teletopia Project, local governments 
receive financial aid to improve their telecommunications 
systems if deemed necessary. So far, Okinawa Prefecture and 287 
cities, villages, wards and towns have received such support 
from the central government.

  [Text] Osaka, March 28 KYODO -- A new substance that could 
help make everyday electronic devices smaller has been developed 
by researchers at Osaka University. 
  Tomoji Kawai, a professor at the university's Institute of 
Scientific and Industrial Research, said Monday that the 
ferroelectric substance is an artificial crystal superlattice 
membrane. The substance can be used in appliances in which an 
electrical impulse from an integrated circuit is changed into 
sound or vibrations. 
  Kawai said the findings will be presented at a three-day 
annual meeting of the Chemical Society of Japan in Tokyo 
beginning Monday. 
  The new substance, which retains its ability to conduct 
electricity at high temperatures, is made by condensing 
vaporized barium titanate and strontium titanate subjected to 
laser beams. 
  It consists of alternate layers of barium titanate and 
strontium titanate molecules with a thickness of 0.2 micron. 
One micron is a millionth of a meter. 
  Crystalline substances which are ferroelectric have 
commercial applications because of their capacity for 
spontaneous electric polarization reversible by an electric 
field. 
  Since the lengths of the crystalline molecules of the two 
substances differ only slightly, when they are interfaced in the 
layers they generate an extremely powerful lateral strain. 
  Under this strain, the barium titanate crystals are 
stretched 
vertically, making it easy for the atoms to move in a vertical 
axis and increasing the substance's ferroelectric properties. 
Kawai and his team describe the new "strained superlattices" as 
having "superdielectric" properties.

<F P=106> [By Paul N. Villegas] </F>
  [Text] Amid reports on the possible breakdown of trade 
talks between the United States and Japan and Washington's 
perceived threat of withdrawing most favored nation (MFN) status 
on China over human rights issues, Foreign Affairs Secretary 
Roberto Romulo reiterated the Philippines' concerns for an early 
conclusion of the aforementioned conflicts. 
  Mr. Romulo raised this matter after meeting with his 
counterpart, Foreign Minister Prince Mohamed Bolkiah of Brunei 
and Abdul Rahman Bin Mohamed Taib, Minister of Industry and 
Primary Resources in the tiny oil-rich state, the other night. 
  Mr. Romulo said Washington's trade conflicts with Tokyo and 
Beijing are counterproductive to the collective efforts of the 
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in helping realize the 
organization's desire to facilitate the flow of trade among its 
17 members. 
  "The countries in the region cannot help but be affected by 
these difficulties," the foreign affairs chief said, as trade 
talks between the United States and Japan, as well as those 
between the United States and China, seem to have been 
inconclusive and have failed to adequately address the concerns 
of the parties. 
  He called on Washington, Tokyo, and Beijing to view their 
bilateral trade issues in the context of further encouraging 
trade and economic development in the region. "The Philippines 
is calling on all parties concerned to come to terms and resolve 
these trade issues before it adversely affects the stability of 
the region," he added. 
  The United States and Japan have been trying to address the 
latter's massive trade surplus over the former. On the other 
hand, Washington has been linking the granting of MFN status to 
the alleged failure of Beijing to prevent human rights 
violations in China. 
  Mr. Romulo earlier raised these concerns during the recent 
call on him by Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan in the 
country. 
  "Countries in the region are all trying to agree on the kind 
of process we should take in order to solve trade problems 
affecting us instead of having two of our largest trading 
partners go directly head on with each other in ways that are 
not of interests to other economies on this side of the globe," 
the Australian Trade Minister earlier said. 
  In an interview with BUSINESS WORLD before departing for 
Kuala Lumpur last Saturday, Mr. McMullan said Australia wants 
the nascent APEC to become "more effective" by promoting trade 
liberalization in the region. 
  He said Canberra's priorities at the moment regarding APEC's 
role in the region is focused on addressing trade matters that 
would help developing countries benefit from their trade 
relations with the industrialized ones. 
  Although Australia has been vocal on the 
institutionalization 
of APEC, Mr. McMullan said Canberra does not see this move as a 
priority at the moment. 
  "A lot of people in Asia have different views on this," he 
said, referring to the proposed transformation of APEC into a 
more formal structure. 
  "Australia is quite relaxed on the institutionalization of 
APEC. We don't want to press too far on that," he added. 
  "Whether we come to agree on this matter or not, the best 
way 
to address APEC's future direction is to do it by consensus. No 
single (member) country in APEC pretends to have all the answers 
on APEC's future. Everyone's searching. Whether APEC becomes 
institutionalized or not is unimportant ... although the 
establishment of a Secretariat in Singapore seems to indicate 
that APEC is probably becoming institutionalized already," the 
Trade Minister said. 
  He said Australia would rather have two sides of the Pacific 
work together instead of being in conflict with each other. 
  "That is essentially our priority. If the best way to 
realize APEC's goals is to institutionalize the organization, 
then, so be it. But if it's not that necessary, then it's not a 
priority for us," said Mr. McMullan. 
  APEC groups together Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Hong 
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New 
Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, South 
Korea, and the United States. Chile is expected to join the 
organization when the APEC ministers meet this November in 
Indonesia for their annual talks.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Fidel Ramos prior his departure for </F>
Vietnam at Ninoy International Airport in Manila on 28 March -- 
recorded; passages within slantlines in Tagalog] 
  [Text] At the gracious invitation of President Le Duc Anh 
of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, I leave today on a 
three-day official visit to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City with a 
small official delegation. Accompanying us are four members of 
my cabinet, three senators and two congressmen, the president of 
the University of the Philippines, and a business delegation of 
our most prominent industrialists and traders. 
  This trip reciprocates Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit to 
our country three years ago. I regard this visit as one of the 
most significant I have made. Vietnam is one of our closest 
neighbors. It is less than two hours away across the South 
China Sea. Our two countries are alike in terrain, area, 
natural resources, and population. Our cultural connections 
date back at least a thousand years, and our struggles against 
colonialism and foreign conquest were inspired by the same 
ideals of freedom and national independence. But in the course 
of history, we adopted different ideological systems for 
organizing our national societies. The Cold War and the 
Indo-China [words indistinct] raised even greater barriers 
between our two countries. Today, mutual goodwill between our 
two countries have brought down those barriers. Our paths 
converge again on the road to self-sustaining economic growth, 
and our two countries today seek national security and regional 
stability, neither in military alliances nor in accumulating 
weapons but in friendly consultation and economic cooperation 
with neighbor countries. 
  With Vietnam and the other Southeast Asian states, our 
country has a shared destiny. We have found that there is no 
alternative to peace and economic cooperation among us in this 
region. Over the next generation, Vietnam is certain to become 
one of Southeast Asia's most important states and a major force 
in the regional balance of power. Its incorporation in the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, is an imperative 
of Southeast Asian peace, security, and prosperity. In Manila 
in July 1992, Vietnam acceded to the Bali Treaty of the ASEAN 
States, which binds iis signatories to settle regional disputes 
peaceably. Vietnam's full membership in ASEAN is now a matter 
no longer of policy or principle, but merely of time and 
procedure. Even now, Vietnam already takes part in a wide range 
of ASEAN cooperative activities. For instance, it is a part of 
the ASEAN Regional Forum, to which ASEAN and friendly outside 
powers consult on regional security. 
  The Philippines took the initiative of wholeheartedly 
supporting Vietnam's membership in ASEAN and its associated 
institutions. We have also consistently supported Vietnam's 
efforts to re-establish normal relations with the global 
community and to secure membership in international financial 
and political organizations. Philippine-Vietnamese relations 
are a critical force for the solidarity of Southeast Asia and 
consequently for peace and progress of the Asia- Pacific region. 
I am confident that this visit, the first by a Philippine 
president to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, will advance 
this relations substantially. 
  The facets of our bilateral relationships are many and 
increasing. There are, therefore, important things for my 
delegation to discuss with Vietnam's leaders. There is the 
security of East Asia and the Pacific. Its present status can 
now be enhanced cooperatively by the nations of the region. I 
shall be exploring avenues of possible cooperation between our 
two countries in seeking a breakthrough to the multiple 
competing claims to the Spratlys archipelago in the South China 
Sea. Perhaps a joint venture in marine research of the islands 
related to ocean research, weather forecasting, and 
environmental protection, and participated by all the claimants, 
for a start of the confidence-building mechanisms that we need 
to settle these claims for our mutual benefit. [sentence as 
heard] There are other creative proposals that I intend to 
discuss with our Vietnamese neighbors. Then, there is the new 
thrust in economic cooperation which ASEAN has undertaken. 
Through the ASEAN Free Trade Area or AFTA, to which a talented 
and hardworking Vietnamese people have a great deal to 
contribute. 
  I look forward to inform the leaders of Vietnam of the 
political consolidation and economic reforms that we are 
undertaking in our country and the results these measures have 
so far achieved in our overall effort to open our economy to 
market forces and to global competition. In turn, I hope to 
learn from them the workings of their own economic renovation or 
doi moi which has made Vietnam one of the fastest growing 
economies in the world this past seven years. The lifting of 
the American trade embargo last month and the American 
investment it is expected to bring should both speed up the pace 
and broaden the scope of its economic growth. The increasingly 
favorable economic situation in Vietnam should also make it 
easier for our two countries to find a durable solution for the 
problem of Vietnamese asylumseekers in the Philippines. 
  Great potentials for economic cooperation between our two 
countries are opening up. My delegation will look into 
possibilities of counter trade, investments, complimentation, 
and joint-ventures in each other's economies. We shall offer 
the Vietnamese the help of our industrialists, managers, and 
technologists in rebuilding their infrastructure and 
telecommunications systems, planning their new cities, and 
managing their tourist facilities. There should also be great 
room for collaboration between us in education, language 
training, and training of technical people. We shall be 
proposing the activation of our joint commission on trade and 
economic cooperation. 
  The business leaders in my delegation intend to identify 
with 
their Vietnamese counterparts specific products that we can 
profitably exchange in the light of the present low level trade 
between our two countries and of the prospects offered by the 
growth and diversification of our respective economies. There 
are opportunities also in agriculture and in agricultural 
research. Like our country, Vietnam is a major producer and 
exporter of agricultural products. We can operate also in 
promoting tourism, both from our neighbors and from outside the 
region. There is also much room for collaboration in science and 
technology, in education, and public health. We have much to 
learn from each other. 
  I expect to discuss these prospects with President Le Duc 
Anh, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, General Secretary Do Muoi of 
the ruling party and the country's other policymakers and its 
private sector. Finally, I look forward to visiting with a small 
but growing community of Filipino businessmen and professionals 
in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. 
  This, then is a historic visit to a very important neighbor, 
a neighbor destined to become even closer to us bilaterally and 
in ASEAN. My dear countrymen, we leave our beloved Philippines 
in a good situation and in good hands. I ask you to pray to the 
Almighty for the success of our mission and for our safe return 
two days from now. Long live the Philippines. Thank you 
very much to all of you.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA March 28 -- Philippine President Fidel V. 
Ramos's official friendship visit to Vietnam expected here today 
is a significant event in the friendly and cooperative relations 
between the two countries, says NHAN DAN in an editorial today. 
  The editorial continues: Vietnam and the Philippines have 
had 
time-honoured culture and trade exchanges. Over the past recent 
years, there have been positive changes in the cooperative 
relations between the two countries. Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet's official visit to the Philippines in 1992 is a great 
landmark in the promotion of mutual understanding and trust, 
creating and impetus to their economic-trade cooperation. The 
two-way trade value increased to nearly USD [U.S. dollars] 50 
million in 1993 from USD 12 million in 1988. The Philippines 
has 11 investment projects in Vietnam with a total capital of 
USD 60 million, ranking 18th among foreign countries investing 
in Vietnam. 'As neighbour, Vietnam and the Philippines have a 
common aspiration for each country's socio-economic progress, 
for peace, stability, cooperation, and development in the 
region. The Philippines and Vietnam have had a common voice in 
seeking peaceful solutions, conforming to their interests as 
well as international laws and pratices, to solve problems left 
behind by the history and foster the friendly and cooperative 
relations between the two countries'. 
  The paper wishes President Ramos's visit a success, thus 
contributing to further promoting the Vietnam-Philippines 
relations for happiness and prosperity of the two nations, and 
for peace, stability, cooperation and development in the region 
and all over the world.

<F P=106> [By Chang Ta-jen and Debbie Kuo] </F>
  [Text] Hanoi, March 28 (CNA) -- P.K. Chiang, minister of 
economic affairs of the Republic of China [ROC], Monday [28 
March] called on the Vietnamese Government to allow Taiwan banks 
access to Vietnam. 
  During a meeting with ranking officials of the central bank 
of Vietnam, Chiang said establishment of Taiwan bank operations 
in Vietnam is essential "to helping Taiwan investors stay and 
expand and consequently contribute to the economic growth of the 
Southeast Asian country." 
  After accepting applications from nine foreign banks, 
including one from Taiwan, the Vietnamese Government froze all 
other applications. 
  Chiang asked the Vietnamese officials to give special 
consideration to an application from another Taiwan bank -- the 
Medium Business Bank of Taipei -- to set up an affiliate in 
their country as Taiwan is the top foreign investor here. 
  Meanwhile, a draft cooperation agreement was signed during a 
ceremony Sunday for the development of a sugar refining plant in 
Vietnam. The agreement brings together the state-run First 
Vietnam Sugar Co., Taiwan Sugar Corp., and three other Taiwan 
food processing companies. 
  The joint venture operation, to be named Vietnam-Taiwan 
Sugar 
Corp. (VTSC), will be the biggest single investment project ever 
from Taiwan. 
  The VTSC investment, with a price tag of U.S.$66 million and 
a projected annual production of 90,000 metric tons of crude 
sugar, is awaiting approval from the Legislative Yuan, Chiang 
said. 
  Chiang, during a meeting with Vo Tran Chi, ruling party 
secretary-general of Ho Chi Minh City, pointed out that 
increasing land prices in Vietnam, fueled by a new land law, 
have led to difficulties for foreign investors, specially those 
from Taiwan. 
  The greatest effect will be on a Taiwan industrial 
processing 
zone which was developed in Hanoi before the land law went into 
effect. Under the land law, investors who use the land must pay 
compensation for crops which would have been produced on the 
land for the next 50 years. 
  "The investment plan may be put on hold if the problems 
surrounding land acquisition are not resolved," said Fang 
Jeng-hui, manager of the processing zone. 
  The new land law has already scared away many potential 
Taiwan investors who planned to move their operations to 
Vietnam, Fang said. 
  Up to January, the Vietnamese Government had approved 113 
applications by Taiwan investors for investments worth over 
U.S.$1.53 billion, making Taiwan the top forign investor here.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-san: "The Method of Strength Does Not </F>
Work on Us"] 
  [Text] The Korean peninsula is in a grave situation due to 
U.S. imperialists' aggravating provocative maneuvers for a new 
war. Following U.S. President Clinton's order given on 22 March 
to deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea and the announcement 
that more than 40 missile launchers and an 800-member Patriot 
battalion will be moved to South Korea, war conspiracies are 
being plotted in the U.S. Defense Department everyday, and 
corresponding actual fighting measures are being taken. 
  According to reports from Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary 
Perry raved on 24 March that if the UN Security Council decides 
to impose sanctions against our country, the United States will 
send additional troops and weapons to South Korea. 
  Concurrently, the 25 March issue of the South Korean paper 
CHOSON ILBO quoted U.S. military sources as saying that a plan 
was being worked out by the U.S. military to hurl 600,000-strong 
military strength including two Marine divisions, more than 200 
warships, over 1,600 planes from the U.S. mainland within 80 
days, repeat 80 days, in case of emergency on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Meanwhile, U.S. Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Slocombe 
said on 24 March at a hearing at the defense committee of the 
U.S. Congress that U.S. carrier task fleets are in full 
readiness for mobilization to cope with a possible contingency 
on the Korean peninsula and the mobilization system of the U.S. 
imperialist aggression forces in South Korea was under 
reexamination. He raved that apart from the U.S. imperialist 
aggression forces in South Korea, 22,000 U.S. Marine forces, an 
Army special unit, and 50 each of the F-15C interceptor planes 
and F-16 multipurpose fighters from the island of Okinawa in 
Japan, and U.S. carrier military strength from Yokosuka port can 
be mobilized additionally. 
  Facts show that the U.S. military is in a posture to take 
military actions as soon as the UN Security Council takes 
sanction measures. Due to the U.S. war maniacs, darker clouds 
of war are approaching the Korean peninsula, and a dangerous 
situation on the brink of war is being created. 
  This was the first time since the Korean War in 1950 that it 
was reported the U.S. Marine forces, planes, and various 
warships could be swept in herd to the Korean peninsula like a 
pack of wolves. 
  The reason the world is watching the Korean peninsula with 
grave concern is because it is considered that a new nuclear war 
might erupt right here. 
  Currently, the United States is devising a sinister plot 
to commit to the Korean war not only its elite force from its 
mainland, but also the U.S. imperialist aggressive forces 
occupying South Korea that are familiar with our country's 
topography and most of the U.S. armed forces stationed in 
Okinawa, Japan. Moreover, the heads of the U.S. military are 
dispatching in advance its aircraft carriers and submarines to 
places that will be favorable in their operations. 
  The U.S. Naval fleet consisted of 30 ships, and the 
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Carl Vinson have not only been 
already mobilized near the waters of our country, but on 24 
March the U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarine, Birmingham 
entered Yokosuka port. 
  On the surface, the United States is finding fault with us 
by 
saying that it is dissatisfied with the nuclear inspection on us 
and so on, but this is only an excuse. In reality, the series 
of military moves prove that the United States is expanding step 
by step its oppressive strategy on Korea in accordance with the 
war scenario it already wrote. 
  Moreover, what cannot be overlooked is the fact that reports 
are being made that U.S. Defense Secretary Perry will crawl into 
South Korea and Japan to personally examine and command 
on-the-spot the conditions for promoting military operations. 
Historically, this kind of act is carried out frequently on the 
eve of war. Such was the case during the 1950 Korean war and 
during the 1990 Persian Gulf war. 
  We are dealing with high vigilance over the fact that the 
U.S. defense secretary is personally acting as the leader in 
preparing to invade us. Currently the United States formed a 
special strike force to revive the adventurous military 
operation, which was carried out in Grenada and Panama, against 
our republic. 
  However, the United States can by no means frighten our 
people through this kind of barbarous operation and achieve its 
goal. As we have repeatedly elucidated, we don't want war, but 
we are by no means afraid of war. We are ready for both 
dialogue and war. 
  The attempt to swallow us up is a foolish act of trying to 
break a boulder deeply rooted in the center of the earth, with a 
rotten egg. No one can touch our sacred territory and defame 
our nation's dignity. 
  Those who enjoy fire die by being burnt without exception. 
The United States must not carry out rash and thoughtless acts. 
It will be favorable for the United States to correctly see who 
it is dealing with and act rationally.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- U.S. Defence 
Secretary Perry declared on March 24 that if the United Nations 
Security Council decided to take "sanctions" against North 
Korea, the United States would send additional troops and 
weapons to South Korea, according to a report from Washington. 
  The South Korean paper CHOSUN ILBO March 25 quoted "U.S. 
military sources" as saying that a plan was being worked out by 
the U.S. military to hurl 600,000-strong military strength 
including two marine divisions, more than 200 warships, over 
1,600 planes, etc. to the Korean peninsula from the U.S. 
mainland within 80 days in "case of emergency." 
  Meanwhile, U.S. Deputy Undersecretary of Defence Slocombe 
said on March 24 that a U.S. carrier task fleet was in "full 
readiness for action" to cope with "a possible contingency" on 
the Korean peninsula and the mobilization system of the U.S. 
imperialist aggression forces in South Korea was under 
reexamination. 
  Facts show that the U.S. warmaniacs are rendering the 
situation of the Korean peninsula extremely strained. But their 
attempt to frighten the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
with strength is really a foolish act. 
  Our people and People's Army want peace but are never afraid 
of war. 
  The U.S. imperialists would be well advised to act with 
discretion and stop running riot with proper knowledge of Korea. 
  Our people and People's Army, who are united closely around 
the party and the leader, are keenly watching the military moves 
of the U.S. imperialists.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 27 (KCNA) -- The U.S. Defence 
Secretary, William Perry, at a press conference on March 25 
announced a series of reckless operational plans for the 
dispatch of additional U.S. military strength and equipment to 
South Korea, reinforcement of the combat capacity of the U.S. 
imperialist aggression forces occupying South Korea and 
acceleration of the "modernisation" of the South Korean puppet 
army, crying for "elaborate measures" to counter accidental 
developments" on the Korean peninsula, according to a report. 
  Perry's remarks fully revealed the dangerous scheme of the 
U.S. imperialists to unhesitatingly lead the situation on the 
Korean peninsula to a catastrophic war phase. 
  It is the U.S. imperialist war hawks who are creating the 
danger of "accidental developments" on the Korean peninsula and 
it is again them who are driving the situation to the brink of 
war. 
  Now task forces of the U.S. Navy including an aircraft 
carrier are moving towards the waters close to Korea, Patriot 
missile units are heading for South Korea and large aggression 
forces are ready for departure in the U.S. mainland and 
surroundings of the Korean peninsula. 
  According to foreign press reports, Perry will fly to South 
Korea and Japan in a short time to examine and adjust on the 
spot the preparations of military operations designed to provoke 
a new war which the U.S. imperialists are now promoting 
feverishly. 
  This predicts that the U.S. imperialists will lead the 
situation on the Korean peninsula to a more grim phase by their 
military frenzy. 
  If the U.S. imperialits think they can frighten us with 
military threat, it is, indeed, a foolish dream. 
  They must stop running rashly, clearly knowing that the 
option of confrontation and war will precipitate their own doom.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- Vietnam and Malaysia 
on March 24 conferred on mounting tension in the Korean 
peninsula and called on the international community to help 
avert any possible outbreak of war, according to a foreign press 
report from Kuala Lumpur. 
  The two countries shared this view during talks between 
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed and General Secretary 
of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Communist Party of Vietnam 
Do Muoi, an aide to Do Muoi said. 
  The aide said that the U.S. military reinforcement in South 
Korea was "unwarranted and an act of provocation against the 
North", adding: "This spectacular military display by Washington 
against Pyongyang must be taken seriously." 
  The aide contended that Washington had triggered tensions in 
the Korean peninsula in the hope of diverting world attention 
away from growing U.S. domestic problems, President Bill 
Clinton's fate in the "Whitewater scandal" and other issues.

<F P=106> ["Lesson for Provokers"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
have committed one provocation after another against the Korean 
people through history. Each time, however, they suffered a 
stern punishment. 
  They, failing to draw a lesson from the sinking of their 
pirate ship "General Sherman" in the river Taedong in 1866, 
started a surprise attack on the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea on June 25, 1950 after watching for a chance. 
  In an attempt to gratify their sinister ambition for 
aggression at any cost, they hurled into the Korean war one 
third of their Army armed with latest-type equipment, one fifth 
of their Air Force, the bulk of the Pacific Fleet, soldiers of 
their 15 satellite states and the South Korean puppet army, more 
than two million strong, huge combat technical equipment and 73 
million tons of war supplies. The aggressors, however, met 
head-on hammer blows of the Korean people. 
  In the Korean war they lost 1,567,000 effectives including 
405,000 GIs, 12,200 planes, 3,250 tanks and armoured vehicles, 
560 warships and many other combat technical equipment. 
  On July 27, 1953, the U.S. imperialist aggressors signed the 
armistice agreement before the flag of the DPRK, surrendering to 
the Korean people. This was their first ignominious defeat in 
their 100-year-long history of wars of aggression. 
  The case of the spy ship "Pueblo" in January, 1968, was 
another provocation committed by the U.S. imperialists, 
forgetting the lesson of their defeat. 
  When the armed spy ship was apprehended by the DPRK after 
intruding into its territorial waters to infringe upon its 
sovereignty, they drove the situation to the brink of war, 
threatening that they would "bombard" and "blockade" ports of 
the DPRK as "retaliatory steps." At that moment, all the Korean 
people and People's Army manifested their unswerving will to 
answer a "retaliation" with a retaliation, a "total war" with a 
total war. 
  To meet the U.S. imperialist aggressors, the People's Army 
soldiers took their positions and the entire working people 
wrought miracles in production and construction with a rifle in 
one hand and a sickle or a hammer in the other, demonstrating 
the mettle of the Korean people. 
  The U.S. imperialists who were threatening an immediate war 
succumbed to the Korean people, who rose up like a mountain. On 
December 23, they came out with a white flag to the conference 
room in Panmunjom where they had signed the armistice agreement, 
admitted their criminal act concerning the ship "Pueblo" case 
and apologized to the Korean people for it and signed the 
surrender document promising not to commit such provocation 
again. They, however, infiltrated an EC-121 large 
reconnaissance plane into the air space of the DPRK on April 15, 
1969 only to suffer a serious defeat under the eyes of the world. 
  The Korean people are an indomitable people who have never 
pardoned the provokers. 
  The provokers must draw a lesson from their defeat.

  [Text] Havana, March 24 (KCNA) -- The decision of the U.S. 
imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique to deploy 
Patriot missiles in South Korea and resume the Team Spirit 
nuclear war game is an open challenge to the 70 million Koreans 
desirous of a peaceful reunification of the country, said Kim 
Chang-su, deputy head of the mission of the South Korean 
National Democratic Front [SKNDF] in Cuba, in a press interview 
today. 
  He denounced the U.S. imperialists for making a fuss over 
the 
fictitious "nuclear issue" of the North. 
  He said: "Pressure and threat cannot defeat justice. The 
United States must not forget that it was Korea where it drank 
the bitter cup of its first defeat".

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 27 (KCNA) -- The U.S. Defense 
Department in an annual report recently submitted to the 
President and Congress suggested that in case non-nuclear states 
developed and used chemical or biological weapons, they should 
"be restrained with the use of nuclear weapons." The hardliners 
argue that this measure would be "an effective means of curbing 
the development of chemical and biological weapons by 
non-nuclear states". 
  This openly revealed their intention to threaten all the 
non-nuclear states with nuclear weapons and monopolize chemical, 
biological and nuclear weapons, stresses NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The news analyst says: 
  If this ambition of the United States is overlooked, the 
non-nuclear states cannot be free from U.S. threat of nuclear, 
chemical and biological weapons. 
  The demand of the hardliners of the U.S. military for the 
"use of nuclear weapons" is patent proof of the falsehood of 
U.S. propaganda that it "is a peaceful state obliged to prevent 
nuclear proliferation worldwide." 
  If the U.S. is really interested in promoting a fair 
implementation of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], it 
must assure the international community it will not threaten the 
non-nuclear states with nuclear weapons and show its will for 
nuclear disarmament in practice. 
  The U.S. nuclear threat to non-nuclear states increases the 
partiality of the NPT, which imposes unilateral restriction and 
inspection on non-nuclear states while recognizing the right of 
nuclear monopoly of the nuclear-weapon states. 
  In abusing the NPT, the United States seeks to monopolize 
the 
nuclear weapons and, by wielding them at random, lord it over as 
the dominator of the world twisting all countries round its 
finger. 
  Nuclear threat cannot be a cure-all.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- The SANKEI SHIMBUN, 
NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN and other subsidized newspapers of Japan 
said "North Korea is suspected of using nuclear technology 
exclusively for the manufacture of weapons" and it "is trying to 
gain time for the completion of nuclear weapons." 
  We cannot but heighten vigilance because the anti-DPRK smear 
campaign of Japan is getting all the more undisguised at a time 
when the situation on the Korean peninsula has been brought to a 
critical phase by the new war provocation moves on the part of 
the United States and the South Korean puppet clique. 
  As is known, the recent inspection activities performed by 
the inspectors' group of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
were sufficient to fully verify the non-diversion of nuclear 
material at our nuclear facilities and definitely ensure the 
continuity of safeguards. 
  Yet the paid media of Japan are charging the DPRK with 
"exclusive use of nuclear technology for arms manufacture" and 
"gaining time". This is aimed at harming the DPRK by inventing a 
pretext at whatever cost and isolating and stifling it through 
international "sanctions" and pressure. 
  By spreading false rumours about the "nuclear issue" of the 
DPRK, Japan seeks a sinister purpose of justifying its ambitious 
project of becoming a nuclear power. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must refrain from a smear 
campaign 
against others, properly liquidate the past, discard the 
criminal design to make Japan a nuclear power and stop swimming 
against the trend of the times.

<F P=106> ["Japan Will Never Be Safe, Either" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comments on the Japanese authorities' persistent obstruction to 
the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  The news analyst says: 
  Recently, Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said 
"suspected nuclear programme of North Korea causes great concern 
in the international community." And Japanese Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata blared that "if North Korea refuses inspection or 
takes an irresolute attitude, Japan will show a stern response." 
  This is a reversed logic defending the criminal posing a 
nuclear threat. 
  The Japanese reactionaries' false propaganda and pressure 
campaign against the DPRK are dangerous acts aggravating the 
tensions on the Korean peninsula and bringing the situation to a 
more acute phase. 
  In crying over "threat" from the DPRK, they intend to invent 
a pretext to justify their armament expansion and Japan's 
conversion into a military power and openly promote Japan's 
nuclear armament which has reached the danger line. 
  What is grave is that the Japanese ruling quarters are 
revealing their scheme to take a military action against the 
DPRK while working to isolate and stifle it in collusion with 
imperialist reactionaries. 
  The Japanese authorities' phraseology about "sanctions" and 
"stern response" to the DPRK shows that they are looking for a 
chance to launch an anti-DPRK military action with the nuclear 
issue as a pretext. 
  The Japanese reactionaries, dreaming of repeating the 
history 
of aggression, regard the Korean peninsula as the first target 
in their overseas expansion. 
  If the situation on the Korean peninsula goes worse and a 
war 
breaks out, Japan will never be safe, either. 
  The reckless military action of the Japanese reactionaries 
against the Korean people will result in digging their own grave.

<F P=106> ["U.S.-Japan Military Tieup Fraught With Danger"--KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 27 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comes out with an article on the undisguised anti-DPRK, 
anti-socialist campaign conducted by the United States and Japan 
while tightening military tieup under the cloak of "Japan-U.S. 
security." 
  The author of the article says: 
  The U.S.-Japan military tieup is an immediate offspring of 
their policies toward Korea and Asia. The U.S. and Japanese 
reactionaries are persistently seeking military tieup, motivated 
by the ambition to stifle the DPRK with strength and invade and 
dominate Asia with the Korean peninsula as a springboard. 
  They are showing new dangerous military moves around the 
Korean peninsula while continuing military confabs for the 
upkeep of U.S. troops in Japan, Japan's assistance to them, 
intensified cooperation in military technology and arms buildup 
under the cloak of "Japan-U.S. security." 
  At a meeting on "Japan-U.S. security affairs" a few days 
ago, 
the U.S. and Japanese ruling quarters confirmed that the 
"Japan-U.S. security pact" was "vital." They claim that the 
"pact" has not lost its meaning but, on the contrary, has 
assumed a new meaning because "destabilising factors still 
remain" in Asia, specially the Far East. 
  Their description of the DPRK as "a destabilising being" is 
a 
reversed logic and a trick to invent a pretext for strengthening 
their military tieup and anti-DPRK camhaign. 
  Intensified cooperation in military technology and active 
promotion of the unification of military activities are part of 
their moves to tighten military tieup. 
  It is noteworthy that the United States and Japan are these 
days making haste with the "theatre missile defence initiative" 
allegedly to cope with "nuclear threat" and "missile threat" 
from the DPRK. The "theatre missile defence initiative" is aimed 
at a missile attack on the DPRK. 
  In this way, the United States is pursuing a military 
adventure against the DPRK and socialism and the Japanese 
reactionaries are going to arm themselves with missiles. 
  The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are proceeding with 
studies to strengthen the joint operation posture for a "case of 
emergency" on the Korean peninsula. Large-scale U.S.-Japan 
combined field exercises of three services have been held 
several times in recent years on a "scenario of the case of 
emergency on the Korean peninsula." 
  Their dream of stifling the DPRK and invading and dominating 
Asia through their military tieup is anachronistic. 
  We are fully prepared to respond to any military pressure 
and 
offensive from them. 
  They must immediately give up the attempt to stifle the DPRK 
through military tieup.

  [Text] While the U.S. imperialists' new war provocation 
maneuvers are rapidly aggravating the situation on the Korean 
peninsula, U.S. military moves are being intensified with an 
increasingly dangerous nature. 
  According to the U.S. newspaper THE NEW YORK TIMES dated 27 
March, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry ordered that modern fighters 
be dispatched to South Korea and Japan immediately if the UN 
Security Council imposes sanctions on our country. He has also 
ordered an increase in the supply of ammunition and parts for 
the U.S. Air Force in South Korea so that modern fighters, such 
as the F-117 Stealth fighters and F-15E's, can go into action 
immediately. 
  The war fanatic also held a so-called news conference on 25 
March, in which he raved about the need for thorough measures to 
cope with possible contingencies on the Korean peninsula and 
disclosed an operational plan for the additional dispatch of 
U.S. troops and military equipment to South Korea to augment the 
combat capability of U.S. imperialist aggression forces in South 
Korea. 
  He did not forget to rave that the step of dispatching 
modern 
fighters to South Korea is aimed at coping with someone's 
southward invasion. However, the U.S. military leaders' order 
on the additional dispatch of armed forces, which is timed with 
the recent frenzied commotions of military threats against us by 
the U.S. bellicose circles, show that the U.S. imperialists are 
the ones who are aggravating tension on the Korean peninsula and 
that they are the main culprit in leading the situation to the 
brink of war. 
  The fact that the U.S. imperialists have recently moved the 
U.S. Navy task force, including aircraft carriers, to the waters 
near our country, prepared their aggression forces in the U.S. 
mainland and in the area surrounding the Korean peninsula for a 
state of swift dispatch, and transported war material and U.S. 
troops to be mobilized in the Team Spirit joint military 
exercise to U.S. bases in Japan by air, clearly proves once 
again that they are intentionally maneuvering to further 
aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula. 
  If the U.S. imperialists think that they can frighten 
someone 
with these military threats and blackmail, they are 
miscalculating. The U.S. imperialists should clearly see that 
this road of dashing to confrontation and war leads to their own 
grave and act with discretion.

  [Text] A crisis that could touch off an extremely 
dangerous situation [wihom chommanhan sataega yubaldoelsuinnun 
wigigungmyonui sanghwang] is being created on the Korean 
peninsula due to the adventurous war provocation maneuvers of 
the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique. 
Bellicose, abusive remarks that threaten us are being uttered 
by bosses in U.S. political circles who have started down a road 
of breach of faith by overturning the DPRK-U.S. New York 
agreement. 
  In a news conference on 18 March U.S. President Clinton 
revealed his intention to resume the Team Spirit-94 joint 
military exercise. On 22 March he ordered the deployment of 
Patriot missiles to South Korea. 
  On 22 March U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, speaking at 
the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, clamored that the 
International community should take strong sanctions against 
North Korea. On 24 March U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry 
babbled that the United States will send additional troops and 
weapons to South Korea in case the United Nations decides to 
take sanctions against North Korea. 
  On 24 March Sam Nunn, chairman of the U.S. Senate Military 
Affairs Committee, spreading a rumor that an attack by someone 
is imminent, openly clamored that the United States should make 
firm war preparations. In addition, the bellicose forces in the 
United States these days are uttering random abusive remarks 
threatening us militarily whenever an opportunity presents 
itself. 
  At the same time, a Patriot missile battalion is moving from 
the United States to South Korea, aircraft carrier fleets of the 
U.S. Navy [mihaegun hanggong moham hamdaedul] are being 
mobilized in the waters near our country, and large-scale U.S. 
imperialist aggression armed forces on the U.S. mainland and in 
areas near the Korean peninsula have assumed a mobilization 
posture. 
  According to a South Korean newspaper report that quoted a 
U.S. source, U.S. military authorities are mapping out an 
operational plan in case of emergency on the Korean peninsula to 
mobilize 600,000 troops, more than 200 naval ships, and more 
than 1,600 airplanes from the U.S. mainland within 80 days. 
  Joining the adventurous war maneuvers by the U.S. 
imperialists the South Korean puppet clique is now frantically 
running wild to inspire war fever in an attempt to attack us. 
  On 21 March traitor Kim Yong-sam held a meeting of 
security-related ministers in Chongwadae [presidential 
headquarters] and clamored that a perfect military security 
posture should be established to cope with someone's 
provocation. On 22 March he again urged the puppet military 
bosses to establish an iron-tight defense posture against North 
Korea. 
  On 21 March traitor Kim Chong-pil of the Democratic Liberal 
Party also clamored that a strong countermeasure should be taken 
against the North. Furthermore, puppet National Defense 
Minister Yi Pyong-tae clamored about a strong chastisement and 
retaliation on 23 March at a meeting of the National Defense 
Committee of the puppet National Assembly. 
  On 25 March puppet Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang clamored 
about 
the establishment of strong countermeasures in the puppet Joint 
Chiefs of Staff and, thus, openly agitated for reunification 
through a northward invasion. On 26 March he went so far as to 
prowl about the puppet units in the frontline area, inspiring 
war fever by babbling about the establishment of a perfect 
defense posture. 
  According to a radio report from Seoul, the puppet Army held 
an expanded staff meeting on 26 March and decided to further 
strengthen its military posture in order to immediately perform 
its combat mission in an emergency. It has also been revealed 
recently that the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and the 
South Korean puppet Army has gone so far as to map out an 
extremely dangerous new operational plan, known as 5027, calling 
for northward invasion. 
  According to this war scenario the South Korean puppet Armed 
Forces have been on security alert under traitor Kim Yong-sam's 
instruction since 23 March. Along with this, the U.S. 
imperialists these days are dragging various types of combat 
planes, such as pursuit planes, vertical take-off and landing 
planes, and fueling planes to the skies over South Korea to 
stage with the puppets a provocative joint aerial war exercise 
aimed at a northward invasion. The South Korean puppets are 
firing weapons in the areas near the Military Demarcation Line 
and the DMZ. Thus, day after day they are waging military 
provocation maneuvers in the skies, on the ground, and at sea. 
The whole land of South Korea is filled with a warlike 
atmosphere.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- A very grave situation 
fraught with danger of war has been created on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The United States and the South Korean puppet clique are 
openly crying that they would resume the provocative "Team 
Spirit" joint military exercises and have decided to deploy 
"Patriot" missiles in South Korea. Now fleets of aircraft 
carriers of the U.S. Navy are moving toward the waters close to 
Korea. 
  Synchronizing with this, the South Korean puppet Army has 
been put on a "standby posture" on the order of the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam and the puppet Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a "special 
emergency order" to all the puppet Army. 
  These provocative moves are very dangerous developments 
which 
may cause a catastrophic crisis on the Korean peninsula. 
  The perfidious act of the United States in totally reversing 
the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New 
York is the factor driving the situation on the Korean peninsula 
to the brink of war. 
  Raising unreasonable preconditions to us who have honestly 
implemented the points of its agreement with the U.S., the 
United States manipulated the Board of Governors of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency at its meeting to adopt an 
unjustifiable "resolution" against us. Worse still, it is 
trying to introduce "sanctions" against us at the United Nations 
Security Council. 
  The seditious forces of the United States are posing a grave 
military threat to us, letting loose a string of very 
provocative belligerent outbursts that the "international 
community must take tough measures", and it "must increase 
pressure on North Korea by practical acts." 
  The acts of the United States in bringing the situation to 
extremes after reversing the agreed conclusions in New York and 
making the DPRK-U.S. talks abortive will never produce results 
favourable to it. 
  The United States had better look squarely at the 
seriousness 
of the present situation and ponder it over and must stop the 
reckless row of pressure and adventurous war moves at once.

  [Text] In connection with the fact that following its 
abortion [yusan] of the third stage of DPRK-U.S. talks, the 
United States was recently maneuvering to put military pressure 
on us while kicking up commotions with regard to nuclear 
inspections in the international community, a DPRK Foreign 
Ministry spokesman issued the following statement condemning 
this. 
  Statement by a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman: 
  Following its abortion of the third stage of DPRK-U.S. 
talks, 
the United States was recently maneuvering to put military 
pressure on us while unjustly kicking up commotions with regard 
to nuclear inspections in the international community. 
  While babbling that it would resume the Team Spirit joint 
military exercise, which it had decided to suspend, the United 
States decided to deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea. 
  Forty-eight Patriot missile launching pads and a missile 
unit 
of more than 800 men are moving to South Korea from Texas, the 
United States, on orders from the U.S. President on 21 March, 
and they will reportedly arrive in South Korea toward the end of 
April. This proves that, from the very beginning, the United 
States had no intention to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula through dialogue and negotiations but has used the 
"nuclear problem" as a means of isolating and stifling the DPRK. 
  We sternly denounce the U.S. shipment of Patriot missiles to 
South Korea as a deliberate act to openly break the agreed point 
of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement on refraining from nuclear 
threat to the other and push the situation on the Korean 
peninsula to the brink of war. 
  The United States is bringing Patriot missiles to South 
Korea, laying the blame for the collapse of the dialogue at the 
door of the DPRK. This is a deliberate, dangerous military 
action to make the military situation of the Korean peninsula 
all the more unstable and, further, cause another war. 
  Though the U.S. authorities are now claiming that the 
Patriot 
is a "defensive weapon," they cannot justify its deployment in 
South Korea with any pretext. 
  From the topographical point of view, the Patriot missile 
can 
be used for the purpose of strike at any place of the Korean 
peninsula, which is not large. It is known to everyone that its 
target can be changed by the kind of the warhead it is tipped 
with. The U.S. shipment of new-type Patriots in South Korea is 
nothing but an open aggressive act to threaten the DPRK 
militarily and make a forestalling strike at it. 
  The United States reveals its intention to keep hold on 
South 
Korea indefinitely as its forward base in the Far East and 
continue to play the role of the MP [military police] in this 
region by deploying the improved missiles. 
  Our people and Asian people express a great worry over this 
reckless military action by the United States which threatens 
overall peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in Asia 
in general. 
  The decision of the United States to deploy the new-type 
Patriot missiles in South Korea is an illegal act of wantonly 
violating the Korean armistice agreement and ignoring the 
armistice machine. 
  The armistice agreement clearly stipulates that military 
equipment and combat materiel shall not be introduced into the 
Korean peninsula. 
  In the past days, the United States shipped into South Korea 
nuclear arms and many other kinds of equipment of new types in a 
covert manner, fearful of the armistice agreement. This time, 
however, it openly declared the deployment of the new-type of 
Patriot missiles in South Korea and is forcing it in broad 
daylight. This shows that the U.S. authorities pay no heed to 
the armistice agreement and armistice machine, and they throw 
away any international commitments like a pair of worn-out shoes 
if it is to attain their aim. 
  It must not be overlooked that the South Korean authorities, 
wearing their own nuclear helmet under the U.S. "nuclear 
umbrella," officially asked for the deployment of the Patriot 
missiles, clinging to the coattails of outside forces as ever. 
This clearly shows that the South Korean authorities have 
joined the United States in the nuclear kickup to stifle the 
DPRK and that they are not interested at all in the 
implementation of the "joint declaration on the denuclearisation 
of the Korean peninsula". 
  The behaviour of the South Korean authorities makes it plain 
that they are more zealous in frustrating the DPRK-U.S. talks 
than in realizing the exchange of special envoys. 
  The United States must immediately stop the deployment of 
the 
missiles posing a great threat to peace and security of the 
Korean peninsula and the Far East, and the South Korean 
authorities must discontinue at once their treacherous acts 
harming the fellow countrymen. 
  If the United States finally deploys new-type missiles after 
turning a deaf ear to this just demand of ours, it would entail 
grave consequences. The United States must ponder over this. 
  28 March 1994, Pyongyang

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- The strained situation 
on the Korean peninsula caused by the unreasonable pressure on 
the North from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the 
rupture of the working-level contact for the exchange of 
presidential envoys between the North and South is attributable 
to the aggressive designs of the U.S. side to gain political and 
economic profits by pushing the situation to military tensions, 
the Seoul-based Christian Broadcasting System quoted the Council 
of Clergymen for Justice and Peace of South Korea as saying in a 
statement Thursday. 
  The statement expressed strong opposition to the resumption 
of the Team Spirit war game and the introduction of Patriot 
missiles, warning that they would only increase the danger of 
war on the Korean peninsula. 
  It also criticized the "civilian government's" pro-U.S. 
treacheries, saying that the Kim Yong-sam regime "is entrusting 
important issues related to the existence of the nation to the 
United States through an inconsistent diplomatic policy."

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
puppet Foreign Minister, Han Sung-chu, on March 22 let loose an 
extremely provocative blast, driveling that "the North must 
change its attitude" and "an effect can be expected when 
pressure is put on the North", charging the North with its 
"nuclear issue", according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  In a telephone conversation with the Japanese foreign 
minister that day, he "confirmed time and again the maintenance 
of the international cooperation system". 
  His remarks vividly show that the base intrigues of the 
South 
Korean puppet clique to stifle the fellow countrymen in the 
North have run into extremes. 
  He cried that the North "must change its attitude," not 
uttering a word about the fact that the South Korean puppet 
clique had broken up the North-South dialogue and driven the 
situation of the country to a phase of crisis. This is a 
stereotyped method of the puppet clique to commit crimes and 
shift the blame on to others. 
  Han talked something about "dialogue". But this was a ruse 
to evade the responsibility for the collapse of North-South 
dialogue and a camouflage for the puppets' sinister intention to 
do harm to the North. 
  He revealed the invariable intention of the puppets to 
isolate and stifle the North when he prattled again about 
"effectiveness of pressure" by the "international cooperation 
system". 
  Facts clearly show that the Kim Yong-sam group is, indeed, a 
never-to-be-condoned group of traitors who do not want either 
North- South dialogue or peace and peaceful reunification of the 
country but are trying to plunge the nation into the scourge of 
a nuclear war with the help of outside forces.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comments on the bellicose outcries let out by the South Korean 
"Defence Minister," Yi Pyong-tae, recently at the "Defence 
Committee of the National Assembly." 
  The news analyst says: 
  By "strong retaliation," he meant to unleash a nuclear war 
against the North in conspiracy with outside forces, and by 
"making use of an event of contingency as an opportunity to 
achieve unification," he meant to "unify the country by 
prevailing over communism" through a war with the help of 
outside forces. 
  This was an open provocation against the North and a 
declaration of confrontation. 
  His provoking words against the North such as "strong 
retaliation" came after the entire puppet Armed Forces were 
placed in readiness for attack on the North at a time when the 
U.S. imperialists' aggression forces including nuclear carriers 
were moving close to the Korean peninsula. No one can dare act 
and speak like that, but those who are anxious to ignite a war. 
  However, the puppets' attempt to undermine the socialism of 
the North where the leader, the party and the masses are united 
in one mind is as foolish as trying to break a rock with a 
rotten egg. 
  If the puppets dare ignite a war to destroy our system like 
a 
puppy knowing no fear of a tiger, we will deal a heavy 
retaliatory blow at them.

  [Text] A very grave situation involving a danger of war 
[chonjaeng wihomul naepohan maeu omjunghan chongse] is being 
created on the Korean peninsula. 
  The United States and the South Korean puppet clique are 
openly saying that they will resume the provocative Team Spirit 
joint military exercise. They have decided to deploy Patriot 
missiles to South Korea and are finally planning to send 
additional U.S. troops to South Korea. In addition, U.S. Navy 
aircraft carriers are now moving toward waters near our country. 
  Amid these circumstances, the South Korean puppet Armed 
Forces have been put on a state of alert at traitor Kim 
Yong-sam's order, and the puppet Joint Chiefs of Staff ordered 
the entire puppet military forces to be put on special alert. 
  Seoul is scheming war plots [chonjaeng mouidul] every day. 
These very unusual, provocative moves that can be seen only just 
prior to an adventurous [mohomjogin] war are an extremely 
dangerous development that may cause a catastrophic crisis 
[pagukchok wigirul choraehalsu innun kukhi wihomchonmanhan satae

  The insidious forces [pulsun seryoktul] of the United States 
are making extremely provocative warmaniac outbursts [kukhi 
tobalchogin chonjaeng pogondul], such as remarks that the 
international community must take strong measures, that pressure 
on North Korea must be strengthened by actual steps, that North 
Korea must not misunderstand the U.S. intent, and the like, 
posing military threats against us. 
  All these facts plainly show that the United States is not 
interested in resolving the nuclear issue of the Korean 
peninsula and is only trying frantically to isolate and stifle 
[apsal] our republic.

Korean Puppets"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 27 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
on March 26 brought C-141 and C-130 transport planes loaded with 
a large aggression force and military equipment to the U.S. Air 
Force bases in South Korea from overseas bases, according to 
military sources. 
  In the meantime, an overseas-based P-3 anti-submarine plane 
flown to the sky above the east coastal waters of South Korea 
carried out a sea reconnaissance and an exercise of strike at 
submarines by mines, torpedoes and depth bombs, escorted by 
formations of pursuit planes. 
  On the 25th, the U.S. imperialists deployed Okinawa-based 
formations of F-15s in the Osan Air Force Base, South Korea. On 
the 24th, they brought F-18a pursuit-assault planes to the 
Kunsan Air Force Base, South Korea, from the Yokosuka Base of 
Japan. The U.S. imperialists on March 25 staged an exercise of 
surprise bombing strikes at ground targets and an aerial attack 
exercise in the skies above Tokjok islet, Pyongchang and Tanyang 
areas of South Korea in coordination with war planes flown from 
overseas bases and those belonging to the U.S. Air Force present 
in South Korea and the puppet air force. 
  The South Korean puppets on March 24 and 25 drove dozens of 
armoured cars and heavily armed puppet army troops in a war 
gamble in the areas of Kimpo and Paju Counties, and Cholwon 
County in South Korean Kangwon Province. 
  On the 25th, they sent 20 odd fighter planes of the puppet 
army to the sky above the areas of Paju and Ryonchon, and 
Cholwon and Rinje of South Korean Kangwon Province, which are 
adjacent to the demilitarized zone and staged exercises of 
missile strike at ground targets and airlifting operation. 
  Such war exercises staged at a time when the aggression 
forces of the U.S. Pacific Fleet are moving toward waters close 
to the Korean peninsula and the U.S. forces in Japan are ready 
for action in "an event of contingency" prove that the new war 
provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
puppets against the northern half of the country are entering 
into a more grave stage.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the 
Central Committee of the League of Socialist Working Youth of 
Korea [LSWYK] in a statement today denounced the dangerous 
military moves of the Kim Yong-sam group which resorts to a 
fascist rule and frantic war racket while advertising "civilian 
government." 
  The statement branded them as reckless acts to put the youth 
and students and other people of South Korea on the altar of war 
and plunge the whole nation into a nuclear scourge. 
  The statement said: 
  Despite strong protest and denunciation from people at home 
and abroad, the South Korean authorities are introducing Patriot 
missiles from the United States and [are] going to resume the 
Team Spirit joint military exercises with their U.S. master and 
inciting a dangerous war fever after issuing a "special alert 
order" to the puppet Army. 
  Frequent sparks kindle a flame. 
  The bellicose elements of South Korea must refrain from a 
rash act, clearly knowing that confrontation and war will 
precipitate their own destruction. 
  We have the might of singlehearted unity with which to smash 
any aggressor forces at one blow. 
  The entire youth and students in the Northern half of the 
country will never tolerate the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's 
confrontation row and war provocation moves. 
  The Korean people are fully prepared to answer a war with a 
war.

<F P=106> ["S. Korea Is To Blame for Breakup of Working Contact"--KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- The whole course of 
eight rounds of working contact for the exchange of presidential 
envoys between the North and the South of Korea was a touchstone 
distinguishing between the stand of national independence and 
that of dependence on outside forces, peace and war, 
reunification and division, patriotism and treachery, says 
NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article today. 
  From the beginning, the South side turned down our side's 
reasonable proposals and measures without any reason, bringing 
forward unreasonable proposals, and thus created deliberate 
obstacles to the working contact, the article says, and goes on: 
  Prior to the eighth round of the contact, the South side, 
making a surprise volte-face from understanding the 
reasonableness of our side's four-point demand including the 
suspension of large-scale nuclear war exercises against the 
dialogue partner, totally brushed it off and perpetrated such a 
perfidious act as getting on the nerve of the North and 
fostering confrontation. 
  Such being the case, the North side, out of the desire to 
prevent the collapse of the working contact at any cost and 
promote it in conformity with its original nature, urged the 
South side again at the eighth round to refrain from such a 
perfidious act and stop getting on the nerve of the dialogue 
partner, inciting confrontation, increasing tension and thus 
bringing dialogue itself to a rupture. 
  The South side, however, categorically opposed the 
fundamental, principled proposals put forward by the North side 
concerning the maintenance of the principle of national 
independence, the promotion of the great unity of the whole 
nation and other matters related to the mission of special 
envoys. 
  It became all the clearer through the whole course of the 
working contact that "the improvement of North-South relations" 
and "dialogue" advocated by the Kim Yong-sam group were a 
ballyhoo and it was seeking to prolong its days as a group of 
colonial stooges by slaying fellow countrymen and putting them 
on the altar of a nuclear war in league with outside forces. 
  With nothing can the South Korean rulers cover up their 
criminal acts in making the North-South relations worse than in 
the period of the former military dictatorship and creating a 
phase of confrontation and war by breaking up the working 
contact, or evade their responsibility. 
  History shows that the days of the flunkeyist traitors 
kissing outside forces, estranged from fellow countrymen, are 
numbered.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Overt Incitement of </F>
Reunification by Advancing to the North"] 
  [Text] While tension on the Korean peninsula is 
aggravating day after day, South Korean puppets' war maneuvers 
of northward aggression are becoming more obvious. 
  According to reports, the puppet defense minister Yi 
Pyong-tae talked about someone's nonexistent provocation at the 
puppet Defense Committee of the National Assembly on 23 March 
and raved that strong retaliation will be taken and a strategic 
concept of making this occasion as an opportunity to achieve 
reunification is being studied. 
  By "retaliation," the rascal [nom] meant to provoke a war 
against us, and by "making this occasion as an opportunity to 
achieve reunification," he meant to "achieve reunification by 
advancing to the North with the help of the United States." 
  This bellicose remark, which cannot be overlooked, was an 
overt incitement of reunification by advancing to the North and 
a declaration of a war of aggression toward the North. 
  As everyone knows, it is the puppets' constant aggressive 
ambition to provoke a war of northward aggression by joining the 
outside forces and to crush [apsal] popular masses-centered 
socialism of our own style. 
  Veiled with a civilian mask, the puppets, who have 
accelerated war preparations more pertinaciously than the 
previous military gangsters, recently broke up dialogue with 
fellow countrymen deliberately, and taking the opportunity, they 
decided to resume the provocative Team Spirit joint military 
exercise and introduce Patriot missiles to South Korea while 
recklessly running wild in order to achieve an alliance system 
with outside forces. These are all aimed at achieving the 
aggression. 
  War maneuvers are multiplying in a phased manner in South 
Korea: puppet armed forces are banned from leave or sleeping 
out, the entire puppet armed forces are in a security posture, 
and a U.S. naval fleet, including an aircraft carrier mobile 
unit, is running about the sea near our country. The Korean 
peninsula is in an acute situation being driven to the brink of 
war. 
  The coinciding puppet defense minister's provoking words 
clearly show that the rascals take the provocation of northward 
aggression and reunification by advancing to the North as an 
established fact, and that, to this end, they are trying to 
light the fuse of war by all means. 
  Following the tracks of the traitor Syngman Rhee, the Kim 
Yong-sam ring is trying to launch a second Korean war while 
playing the role of a shock brigade for the imperialists' 
provocative maneuvers of war of aggression against fellow 
countrymen. 
  Under the condition that over a thousand nuclear weapons are 
placed in South Korea, if a war erupts on the Korean peninsula, 
it will lead to a nuclear war, and our nation will suffer an 
irrevocable nuclear disaster. That is why not only all the 
Korean people but also peace-loving people all over the world 
are outraged at and strongly oppose the puppet clique's 
provocative maneuvers for a new war. 
  The Council of Clergymen for Justice and Peace of South 
Korea, a South Korean Christian group, issued a statement on 24 
March strongly opposing the resumption of the Team Spirit war 
exercise and the introduction of Patriot missiles and warned 
that this would only increase the danger of war on the Korean 
peninsula. It is not coincident that South Korean people from 
all walks of life are rising to wage an antiwar, antinuclear 
struggle. 
  Furthermore, at such a time when voices advocating 
reunification through the confederal system are swelling in the 
North and the South, the Kim Yong-sam ring's criminal maneuver 
of attempting the reunification through armed advancement to the 
North can never be tolerated. 
  The problem cannot be solved by the method of war. If the 
Kim Yong-sam puppet clique dares to covet the northern half of 
the Republic and shake our socialist system, our People's Army, 
which has both offensive and defensive means, will pay back the 
provokers hundreds and thousands times more. 
  We never make empty talk. History shows one who enjoys fire 
will eventually be burned to death. The Kim Yong-sam ring must 
abandon its wild fancy which will never be realized and must not 
rashly run amok. 
  The Kim Yong-sam traitor clique should clearly recognize 
that 
if it insists on following the course to provoke a war despite 
our repeated warning, it would only face a tragic destiny of 
destruction.

<F P=106> ["Gag on the Press in S. Korea"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 27 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comments on the ever more intensified interference in and 
suppression of the press by the "Security Planning Board" (SPB) 
[Agency for National Security and Planning -- "NSP"] in South 
Korea. 
  The "SPB" not only strictly bans the press from reporting 
about the mounting struggle on South Korean people against the 
flunkeyist treacheries of the traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique and 
its confrontational row against the North, their anti-American 
and anti-fascist struggle for democracy and their anti-war and 
anti-nuke struggle but also manipulates the subsidized media to 
mislead public opinion over the "nuclear issue of the North", 
the news analyst of the paper says, and continues: 
  The tightened control on the press by the Kim Yong-sam group 
through the "SPB" is unthinkable apart from the crisis of the 
"civilian government". What the puppets pursue in suppressing 
the press is to bar it from digging up and opening to the public 
their anti-national crimes and curb the anti-"government" action 
of the people. 
  It is a symptom of the end of the "civilian government" to 
try to maintain the treacherous rule by blindfolding the people 
and stuffing their ears and mouths through the suppression of 
the press. 
  The further the puppets intensify their anti-DPRK smear 
campaign and suppression of the people and the press through the 
"Security Planning Board", the fiercer the struggle of the 
people grows against the "civilian" dictatorship.

<F P=106> ["Kim Yong-sam Regime Must Be Replaced by Independent, </F>
Democratic Government, Says NODONG SINMUN"] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 28 (kcna) -- NODONG SINUMN today 
stresses that the traitorous Kim Yong-sam regime must be 
replaced by an independent and democratic government and calls 
on all the South Korean patriotic forces for independence and 
democracy to struggle for the establishment of such a 
government, not deceived by the false advertisement of the 
"civilian" administration. 
  Noting that to establish an independent and democratic 
government in South Korea is the main goal of the struggle for 
independence and democracy, the author of the article says: 
  It will be a government based on the anti-U.S., anti-fascist 
united front and a coalition government made up of 
representatives of various classes, strata, political parties, 
groupings and political forces joining in the struggle for 
independence and democracy. 
  Only when an independent and democratic coalition government 
is established on the grave of the colonial fascist 
dictatorship, is it possible for the South Korean people to 
bring about a historical turn in saving their livelihood from 
distress and defending human dignity and national independence.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
"prime minister," Yi Hoe-chang, at a "roundtable conversation of 
security-related ministers" on March 25 cried for a 
"high-intensity alert posture against the North", a "perfect 
posture for countermove" and the like and, on the 26th, turned 
up at frontline units of the puppet Army and whipped up an 
extreme war fever, drivelling that they should be in a full 
defence posture to cope with an "emergency", according to a 
radio report from Seoul. 
  Meanwhile, the puppet Army held a "plenary meeting of staff 
officers" on March 26 and discussed the question of doing their 
utmost to maintain a posture for immediate entry into action". 
Such moves are unpardonable criminal acts leading the situation 
on the Korean peninsula to the brink of a war. 
  All the developments cleary show that the South Korean 
bellicose elements do not want peace and peaceful reunification 
of the country but have used the North-South dialogue to gratify 
their sinister aim of putting the brakes on the DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group can by no means conceal the fact that 
it is an anti-national group blocking the dialogue between the 
fellow countrymen and trying to inflict the scourge of war upon 
the nation with the help of outside forces. 
  The "civilian" warmaniacs must stop acting rashly, clearly 
mindful of what bitter results their war frenzy would bring to 
them.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Traitor's Ugly, Traitorous </F>
Junket"] 
  [Text] According to reports, traitor Kim Yong-sam made a 
junket to Japan during the period from March 24 to 26 despite 
strong protests of the South Korean and Japanese peoples. As a 
pro-Japanese stooge, his every move made during the junket was 
consistent with begging, asking, and traitorous acts from first 
to last. 
  What cannot go unnoticed before anything else is the fact 
that traitor Kim Yong-sam, in the meeting with Japanese Premier 
Hosokawa, plotted joint countermeasures and asked Japan to join 
in possible UN sanctions pn us by finding fault with our 
fictitious nuclear issue. This vividly shows that his junket to 
Japan was a total antinational junket aimed at harming his 
fellow countrymen in collaboration with the outside forces. 
  As everyone knows, our nuclear issue is a by-product of 
schemes and conspiracies hatched by the imperialist 
reactionaries who aim at crushing [apsal] our republic. The 
U.S. imperialists totally overturned the agreement of the 
DPRK-U.S. New York contact and massively deployed its aggression 
troops on the Korean peninsula and its surrounding region, thus 
driving the situation to the brink of war. This is also aimed 
at realizing such a goal. 
  If a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula as intended by 
the United States and its stooge South Korea, the entire land 
will suffer the nuclear holocaust. If the Kim Yong-sam clique 
had the slightest national conscience and wants peace and 
reunification, it should have rebuffed the imperialist 
reactionaries' maneuvers instead of banding together with them 
who try to harm the fellow countrymen. However, instead, he led 
the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war with 
the outside forces and did not stop there. He even begged the 
Japanese reactionaries to take part in joint countermeasures and 
sanctions, and thus attempted to do something against us. What 
a vicious traitor the rascal [nom] is! 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam, during his junket, raved about 
economic 
cooperation by enumerating on the rectification of the trade 
imbalance, the settlement of the industrial gap, and so forth. 
This, too, cannot be go unnoticed. The South Korean economy is 
a colonial subordinate economy and is a fragile economy which 
cannot be sustained even for a minute without U.S. and Japanese 
equipments, facilities, capital, and technologies. 
  The puppets have been babbling all along that they will 
reduce their trade deficit with Japan. However, because of 
their weak economy, rather than reducing the trade deficit, it 
has been increasing every year. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring agreed to expand investment, open up 
the construction market, and allow Japan's small and 
medium-sized businesses to advance into South Korea. This will 
only result in further intensifying Japan's political and 
economic domination and subordination against South Korea. 
  Moreover, what cannot be tolerated is that as a single 
remark 
of reflecting on the past, Japan's emperor and prime minister 
tried to speak ambiguously of the crimes of the Japanese 
imperialists' aggression on Korea and barbarous colonial rule 
which lasted for almost half a century, and in this connection, 
Kim Yong-sam said that the past must no longer restrain the 
future and babbled about establishing a new South Korea-Japan 
relation. 
  During the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule which lasted 
for some 40 years, the calamities and sufferings which the 
Japanese imperialists inflicted upon the Korean people are truly 
innumerably tremendous. This criminal history cannot by any 
means be erased with the single remark of making a reflection. 
  When viewing the issue of comfort women, the Japanese 
imperialists committed a sin against God and man by forcibly 
dragging in some 200,000 Korean women to carry out all kinds of 
atrocities and even took their lives. Its truth must be 
thoroughly explained and this issue can be resolved only when 
appropriate compensation is made. 
  Therefore, the South Korean people waged demonstrations 
right 
before the puppet traitor's junket to Japan and urged that Kim 
Yong-sam wholly reveal Japan's crimes and strongly demand 
compensation from Japan. However, traitor Kim Yong-sam did not 
even open his mouth on this matter. Nevertheless, because of 
the single remark on making a reflection, he said that he highly 
assesses this, that the past must not restrain the future, and 
so on. Thus, he made the crimes committed by the past Japanese 
imperialists' into white paper. How is this different from the 
Ulsa-5 Treaty? 
  As a result, traitor Kim Yong-sam's junket to Japan was a 
nation-selling junket to tarnish the nation's dignity and sell 
the nation's interest. Therefore, the rascal once again 
revealed his true nature as an ugly flunkeyist nation-seller 
currying favor with outside forces without knowing shame or 
honor if it is for his personal idleness and to maintain power. 
  The criminal conspiracy between the South Korean puppets and 
Japanese reactionaries runs counter to the cause of peace and 
will only result in all the more aggravating tension on the 
Korean peninsula. All the Korean people will absolutely not 
forgive traitor Kim Yong-sam who is all the more running toward 
confrontation and division by visiting outside forces.

<F P=106> ["Unbreakable Unity Between Illustrious Leader and People"-- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- The unbreakable unity 
between the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and the people 
renders Korean-style socialism making a long drive invincible 
and firmly guarantees a bright future of the revolutionary cause 
of chuche in Korea, declares NODONG SINMUN in an article today. 
  The article in the first part says the unbreakable unity 
between the leader and the people is a proud feature of Korean 
society united in one mind. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is quoted as saying: 
  "If the party enjoys the full support and love of the masses 
and is in perfect harmony with them, it can carry out any task, 
however difficult, creditably and with no fear of any enemy." 
  The article continues: 
  The grand features of our society where the leader and the 
people are in perfect unity find clear manifestation in that the 
entire party members, working people and people's army soldiers 
absolutely worship the illustrious leader and fully share the 
will and idea with him. 
  The Korean people have long since revered Comrade Kim 
Chong-il deeply, calling him "The Dear Leader." 
  Their worship of the leader is deepening in the struggle to 
defend Korean-style socialism. 
  The party members and other working people have the 
unanimous 
will to firmly trust and follow only the great General Kim 
Chong-il in any grim period and live under the magnanimous care 
of the revolution. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's idea and theory run 
through our society and serve as the guideline of life and 
struggle and the life-giving water for our people. 
  The grand revolutionary features of our society where the 
leader and the people are in unbreakable unity are fully 
demonstrated in that the entire people always entrust their 
destiny to the illustrious leader and resolutely defend the 
party and the leader. 
  The article in the second part says the unbreakable unity 
between the leader and the people is the source of invincible 
might in carrying the cause of Korean-style socialism to 
accomplishment through whatever ordeals. 
  In Korea the cause of socialism is firmly defended and 
promoted victoriously. It is entirely because the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il and the Korean people are in perfect unity. 
  The perfect unity between the leader and the people is a 
basic factor for resolutely meeting any challenge of the 
imperialists and firmly defending Korean-style socialism. 
  The imperialists and reactionaries today are concentrating 
their attack on isolating and stifling the DPRK after socialism 
collapsed in some countries. But, we are staunchly fighting 
against their attack without the slightest vacillation. 
  As long as we are guided by the dear leader, we will win, 
and 
when we fight closely united behind him, nothing can break 
Korean- style socialism. This unshakable conviction of the 
Korean people enables them to resolutely stand against the 
imperialists and consolidate Korean-style socialism into an 
impregnable fortress. 
  The unbreakable unity between the leader and the people 
serves as a great motive force pushing ahead with socialist 
construction in any circumstance and makes our society a large 
revolutionary family. 
  Today our party and people are famous as a militant party 
and 
invincible people who can do anything once determined. This is 
because socialism is being built on the basis of the unbreakable 
unity between the leader and the people. 
  Thanks to this unity, impressive noble communist virtues are 
in full play and socialism is making a vigorous advance with 
great viability and strength in Korea. 
  The people who advance full of revolutionary optimism, 
closely united behind the illustrious leader, are 
ever-victorious. 
  We will regard the unbreakable unity between the illustrious 
leader and the people as more valuable than our lives and, on 
this basis, will walk the long road of the Korean revolution to 
the last, pushing through trials and ordeals.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- The song "We Will Win 
Because You Are Leading Us" is widely sung among the Korean 
people. 
  The poem of the song was written by Ni In-mo, the 
incarnation 
of faith and will. It represents the unshakable idea that the 
cause of socialism is invincible as long as it is guided by the 
Dear Leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  The Korean people are firmly defending the cause of 
socialism, holding General Kim Chong-il, the great iron-willed 
brilliant commander, in high esteem as supreme commander of the 
Korean People's Army. 
  General Kim Chong-il is a great military genius endowed by 
nature with the resourcefulness and personality of a brilliant 
commander. 
  Possessed of flawless quality and traits of an iron-willed 
brilliant commander and ever-victorious military strategist, he 
has strengthened the people's army and increased the might of 
socialism to be invincible with his unrivalled military 
intelligence, matchless grit and distinguished commanding art. 
Under his guidance today the Korean People's Army has grown 
into ever-victorious revolutionary armed forces equipped with 
modern offensive and defensive means and the entire people have 
been armed and the whole country has been fortified. 
  The Dear Leader is a great brilliant commander who is 
possessed of iron will not shaken by any roar of thunder. 
  Whenever the situation was carried to the brink of war in 
Korea by the aggressive war moves of the U.S. imperialists, he 
dealt a bitter defeat to the enemy in the spirit of decisive and 
fierce attack, without a moment's hesitation and vacilation. 
When the U.S. imperialists and their stooges ran riot last year 
to stifle the DPRK, resuming the frantic team spirit joint 
military exercises and demanding "a special inspection" of it, 
the supreme commander instantly proclaimed a semi-war state and 
powerfully aroused the whole party, the whole country and the 
entire people in defending the dignity and sovereignty of the 
country and the nation. 
  Now the U.S. imperialists are rendering the situation of the 
Korean peninsula extremely strained, after massively bringing to 
the Korean peninsula and its surroundings new-type fighter 
planes, warships and other means of nuclear strike of different 
types and Patriot missiles, totally reversing the agreed 
conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York. 
  The United States is trying to bring the Korean people to 
their knees with a strong arm and pressure. But it is a mistake. 
  Nobody is equal to the strength of the singlehearted unity 
of 
the Korean people rallied closely behind the great brilliant 
commander.

  [Text] Pyongyang, the capital of the revolution where a 
conference of cell secretaries of the whole party will be held, 
is overflowing with joy for greeting the deputies of the 
conference. 
  On the streets in the capital which are decorated with 
various welcoming decorations, the workers from all walks of 
life warmly welcomed the deputies. The deputies will attend the 
conference with great pride in having made active contributions 
to strengthening and developing our party and to accelerating 
the revolution and construction by loyally upholding the 
leadership of the great general [widaehan changgunnim] Kim 
Chong-il and by enhancing functions and role of the party cells. 
  Following the arrival of deputies from Chagang Province, 
North Hamgyong Province, Yanggang Province, and South Hwanghae 
Province, all deputies throughout the country including North 
Hwanghae Province, South Hamgyong Province, and South Pyongan 
Province, arrived in Pyongyang on 25 March. 
  The Pyongyang Railway Station, which greeted the deputies of 
the conference of cell secretaries of the whole party who are 
the core of our party, was overwhelmed from the early morning 
with an atmosphere of warm welcome. 
  A portrait of Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our 
party and people, was respectfully placed in the railway 
station. The slogans reading, "Long live the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song!" and "Long live the glorious Workers Party 
of Korea!" were hung up. 
  Placards reading "We warmly welcome the attendants in the 
conference of cell secretaries of the whole party!" and "Let us 
loyally uphold the party's leadership!" were put up in the 
railway station, and large-size propaganda pictures welcoming 
the deputies of the conference were set up. 
  As the train arrived in the station with deputies aboard, 
the 
welcoming masses, waving bouquets and flowers, warmly welcomed 
the participants in the conference of cell secretaries of the 
whole country who will demonstrate the true shape of our party 
which is firmly rallied behind the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il with a sense of 
loyalty and filial piety. 
  The officials concerned warmly greeted the deputies. The 
deputies, who arrived in Pyongyang--the capital of the 
revolution--were overflowing with the revolutionary passion to 
glorify the conference of cell secretaries of the whole party, 
which will be held splendidly in the great expectations and 
interest of the people across the country, as a meeting of 
loyalty, which will vigorously demonstrate the firm faith and 
invincible will of the party's cell secretaries to tenaciously 
defend and to further glorify the socialist cause--the party's 
cause--without even a slight degree of wavering under any 
complex situation. 
  At the Pyongyang Railway Station, reporter Kim Chun-kyo of 
the Central Broadcasting Network met Comrades So Kwang-su and 
Kil Chang-ho, deputies from South Pyongan Province who will 
attend the conference of cell secretaries of the whole party. 
  [Begin reporter Kim recording] I warmly welcome you who have 
arrived in Pyongyang, the capital of the revolution. Will you 
speak a few words about your impression on arriving in 
Pyongyang, the capital of the revolution? 
  [Begin Deputy So recording] I am indeed pleased to come to 
Pyongyang, the capital of the revolution. From the moment of 
boarding the train, my heart dashed toward Pyongyang where the 
great leader and dear comrade leader are. As I am warmly 
welcomed after arriving in Pyongyang as a deputy of the 
conference of cell secretaries of the whole party, I am 
overflowing with the pride in being the core of our glorious 
party and a responsible figure for the basic party organization 
[kichungdang chojik]. 
  I cannot suppress deep emotion fraught with thanks to the 
great General Kim Chong-il who provided us with a conference of 
cell secretaries of the whole party, which is the first occasion 
in history of our party, and who extended all benevolence and 
love to us after calling us as deputies. [end So recording] 
  [Begin Deputy Kil recording] The cell secretaries of the 
party in our South Pyongan Province who will attend the upcoming 
conference rushed to Pyongyang with deep emotion for benevolence 
of the great leader who called on women party members in 
(Tangsan) and party members in Nagwon during the days of war and 
led the party cell youth. The respected leader's lofty intention 
and effort to strengthen and develop the party cell have been 
brilliantly inherited by energetic activities of the great 
General Kim Chong-il. 
  Even in the midst of a busy time, the dear comrade leader 
personally read the letters sent from the cell members of the 
Fifth Bureau of the Korean Central News Agency and from the 
mining workers' cell in Toksong Mine, and sent reply letters to 
them. Thus, he saw to it that all cells throughout the country 
be firmly consolidated into that of loyalty. Even if the world 
may change a thousand times, I will loudly sing the song of 
faith, "Without You, There Is No Fatherland, With You, We Will 
Win!" I will attend the conference with loyalty cherished by 
our party cell members who trust and follow only the respected 
general Kim Chong-il forever. [end Kil recording] 
  [Begin deputy So recording] Deeply cherishing the lofty 
intentions of the great leader and the dear comrade leader who 
made efforts to strengthen and develop the party cells, I will 
actively contribute to glorifying the upcoming conference held 
for the first time in our party's history as a historic 
conference which will open a new turning point in carrying to 
accomplishment the chuche socialist cause. [end So recording] 
  Thus, the deputies, who will attend a conference of cell 
secretaries of the whole party, have arrived in Pyongyang, the 
capital of the revolution.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- A national 
tree-planting ceremony was held here Friday on the lapse of 47 
years since the great leader President Kim Il-song planted trees 
on Munsu Hill in Pyongyang and on the lapse of 37 years since 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il planted trees on Chang Hill 
in the city. 
  Present at the ceremony were Pak Song-chol, Politburo member 
of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Workers' Party of Korea 
[WPK] and vice-president; Kim Chung-nin, secretary of the WPK 
Central Committee; and Kim Pok-sin, vice-premier of the 
Administration Council. 
  Chu Song-il, chairman of the C.C., the General Federation of 
Trade Unions of Korea, made a report there which was followed by 
speeches. 
  The reporter and speakers recalled that President Kim 
Il-song 
opened up a broad vista for land development, indicating the 
orientation, ways and tasks for reforestation and wisely led the 
work to carry them into practice. 
  They also noted that Comrade Kim Chong-il instituted tree- 
planting day and tree-planting months to convert afforestation 
into a nationwide work and called for a brisk movement of 
tree-planting on a mass scale. As a result, mountains and 
fields of the country are covered with green forests and the 
cities and countryside have changed their appearance, looking 
more beautiful, they added. 
  They referred to the task to create in the next few years 
200,000 hectares of forests of oil-bearing trees and 200,000 
hectares of forests of trees for industrial use. 
  After the ceremony the participants and working people 
planted hundreds of thousands of trees on Munsu and Chang hills 
and in Nungna islet, the Taesongsan holiday resort, Kwangbok 
street and other places to make the capital city of Pyongyang 
more beautiful and covered with more luxuriant verdure.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- The building of the 
tomb of Tangun is progressing at fast speed in Korea. 
  Tangun is the father of the Korean nation who was the first 
king of Kojoson (ancient Korea) (3,000 B.C.-108 B.C.). Situated 
in Kangdong County, Yongyang municipality, the 22 meter high 
tomb will occupy an area of over 800,000 square metres when 
reconstructed. 
  The great leader President Kim Il-song personally studied 
the 
legend of Tangun and materials about his tomb and saw to it that 
the tomb was excavated. After the remains of Tangun and relics 
were excavated and identified scientifically, President Kim 
Il-song went out to the spot and gave instructions to rebuild 
the tomb splendidly to be handed down to the generations to come. 
  Thus, Tangun who had long been known to be a mythical man 
was 
proved to have been a real man and the history of Kojoson 
distorted by the Japanese imperialists when they occupied Korea 
was established correctly. 
  Under the wise guidance of President Kim Il-song, cultural 
heritages which had been severely destroyed by the U.S. and 
Japanese imperialist aggressors have been reconstructed to be 
preserved as treasures of the country and the nation. 
  In recent years, the tomb of King Tongmyong, the founder of 
the Koguryo Dynasty (277 B.C.-668 A.D.) which was the strongest 
country in the East, the tomb of King Wang Kon, the first king 
of Koryo (918-1392) which was the first unified state in Korea, 
the tomb of King Kogukwon (a king of Koguryo in the middle of 
the 4th century), the tomb of King Kongmin (the 31st king of 
Koryo) and tombs of other kings have been restored to their 
original state. 
  The Kwangbop temple in Mt. Taesong (392), the Pohyon temple 
in Mt. Myohyang (1042) and the Pyohun temple in Mt. Kumgano 
(670), Buddhist temples showing the equisite architecture of the 
Korean nation, and the wall on Mt. Taesong belonging to the 
Koguryo Dynasty and the wall on Mt. Ongbang belonging to the 
Koryo Dynasty and many other architectural heritages have been 
splendidly rehabilitated. 
  The Songgyungwan Academy of Koryo (992), one of the first 
universities in the world, was recently rebuilt on an expansion 
basis to be turned into a university training light industrial 
technicians. 
  The chronicles of the Yi Dynasty of 900 books in 1,763 
volumes, the world largest governmental diary covering over 500 
years of the feudal state of the Yi Dynasty, not omitting a 
single day, has been published in modern Korean language. 
  The bibliographical book (25 volumes) of the "80,000 Blocks 
of Complete Collection of Buddhist Scriptures" of 6,793 volumes, 
a library of Buddhism belonging to the Koryo Dynasty, and the 
selected translation of major sutras of the collection have been 
published and a modern house for preserving the collection was 
built in the scenic Mt. Myohyang. 
  Many classical books of history, culture, medical sceince 
and 
other fields such as "Tonguibogam", an encyclopedic book of 
Koryo medicine, "The History of the Three Dynasties" "History of 
the Koryo Dynasty", and "The Tale of Chun Hyang" have been 
collected and arranged. 
  The Korean Central History Museum, the Korean Folklore 
Museum 
and Provincial History Museum are crowded with youth and 
children and working people everyday.

  [Text] Macedonian Council of Australia has called for a

government's use of the term Slav Macedonians. The term refers 
to members of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
  The council has called on Australia's 200,000 Macedonians to 
oppose the federal government's move. The council wants members 
filling out official forms to use only the term Macedonia when 
describing their country of birth and for appeals to be lodged 
if government agencies failed to recognize the term. 
  South Australia's spokesman for the Macedonian Council, 
Alexander Glevchev, admits the campaign may force hardship upon 
members of the community. 
  [Begin Glevchev recording] Hardship is a relative term when 
you are a Macedonian person. We came out here many years ago -- 
our people escaping prosecution, starvation, and war. This 
hardship could be minor in relevance to that. [end recording]

  [Text] A Russian newspaper on 24 March carried an article 
hailing the achievements made in various fields by the Lao 
People's Democratic Republic [LPDR], especially in economic 
development. The newspaper pointed this out in particular 
following the recent visit to Russia by Somsavat Lengsavat, LPDR 
foreign affairs minister. 
  The newspaper said that the relations between Russia and 
Laos 
at the governmental level was suspended for some time. But now 
these relations have been restored. It noted: Russian Foreign 
Affairs Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Lao Foreign Affaires 
Minister Somsavat Lengsat held talks in Moscow in early March. 
As a result of the talks, in addition to revitalizing past 
relations, the two sides also signed a treaty on fundamental 
relations and an agreement on cultural, scientific, and 
technical cooperation between the two countries. The paper went 
on to say that implementing an open-door policy and mechanisms 
of the market economy, Laos achieved peace and development. 
This policy has brought self-sufficiency in food supply and 
monetary stability to Laos and has reduced its inflation rate to 
only between 5 and 10 percent. Comprehensive changes in the 
social sector have also contributed to bolstering Laos' economic 
relations with other countries. Laos is currently utilizing 
foreign investment to build the infrastructure and to expand 
communications routes to the neighboring countries, namely 
Vietnam and Thailand.

<F P=106> [PASASON Editorial: "We, Lao People, Wholeheartedly Hail </F>
and Welcome the High-Level Delegation of the House of 
Representatives of Malaysia" -- date not given] 
  [Text] At the invitation of His Excellency [H.E.] Saman 
Vi-gnaket, chairman of the National Assembly [NA] of the Lao 
People's Democratic Republic [LPDR], H.E. Datuk Mohamed Zahir 
Ismail, speaker of the House of Representatives of Malaysia 
[HRM], and a high-level HRM delegation will pay an official 
friendship to the LPDR from 27 to 30 March. 
  The multiethnic Lao people nationwide, especially residents 
of Vientiane and members of the LPDR NA, are very pleased and 
extremely exuberant to have the honor to welcome H.E. the 
speaker and the high-level delegation of the HRM. 
  The visit to the LPDR by H.E. the speaker and the high-level 
delegation of the HRM takes place after several delegations of 
the LPDR and Malaysia at various levels have exchanged visits 
with one another, especially delegations concerned with the 
economic and cooperation sectors of the two countries. 
Therefore, it can be said that the visit to the LPDR by H.E. 
and speaker and the high-level delegation of the HRM tomorrow is 
very significant and will contribute to strengthening the 
long-standing relations of friendship and cooperation of good 
neighborliness between the two countries and peoples of Laos and 
Malaysia, especially to developing and increasing the relations 
and cooperation between the legislative organizations of the two 
countries. 
  The relations of friendship and cooperation as good 
neighbors 
between the two countries and peoples have existed since ancient 
times. The Lao people always follow with profound interest the 
development of Malaysia. Lao and Malaysian peoples share 
similar traditions, customs, and characteristics. We cherish 
peace, self-mastership, national sovereignty, progress, and 
social justice. We detest aggression, interference, and 
exploitation of other countries. Nonetheless, our two countries 
were once victims of foreign aggression and occupation. 
Therefore, both Lao and Malaysian peoples encountered the same 
fate in the past. 
  Through the arduous and prolonged struggles for national 
liberation and independence, the Lao and Malaysian people deeply 
appreciate the value of peace, freedom, and national 
independence. We also realize the utmost importance of the 
genuine friendship and cooperation for mutual benefits in the 
relations of our two countries and legislative institutions. 
  With regard to the issue of promoting peace, friendship, and 
cooperation among the countries in Southeast Asia, we are of the 
view that Malaysia has played an important role in this 
initiative and has actively carried out activities regarding 
this issue, notably in initiating a plan to turn Southeast Asia 
into a region of neutrality, creating the economic grouping of 
the eastern Asian countries, and implementing the Vision-2020 
policy outlined by H.E. Prime Minister Datuk Mahathir bin 
Mohamed. 
  The success expected from the official friendship visit to 
the LPDR by H.E. Datuk Mohamed Zahir Ismail, speaker of the 
House of Representatives of Malaysia, and his delegation will 
open a new era for the legislative institutions of the two 
countries to normalize and broaden mutual relations and 
cooperation and to more frequently exchange visits by 
delegations at various levels. The delegations can draw 
experience and lessons from one another aside from the current 
development of cooperation in various fields between the 
governments of the two countries. 
  We hope that the friendship visit to the LPDR by H.E. the 
speaker of the HRM and its high-level delegation will be a 
brilliant success.

  [Text] Jakarta, March 24 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- Indonesia's 
biggest naval wargame codenamed "Armada Jaya XVI/94" presently 
taking place in Singkep island off Riau waters which began 
Thursday up to April 5 has no connection with the issues on 
Sipadan and Ligitan islands dispute. 
  The wargame, which involves some 23 warships and no less 
than 
2,000 marines, is conducted yearly by the navy and that it has 
nothing to do with the islands' dispute between Indonesia and 
Malaysia, Western Fleet Commander Rear Admiral Suratmin of 
Indonesia told reporters here after seeing off the troops and 
warships heading for the wargames. 
  Suratmin also made a stress that the wargame is not a show 
of 
force. 
  Accompanied by the wargame director naval Commodore Widodo 
A.S., Suratmin stated the the naval exercises are basically 
aimed at improving the navy's operational ability in using the 
fleet's integrated weaponry system. 
  Asked about the designated site for this year's wargame, he 
said the navy has several times used the location as its site, 
particularly for its amphibian landing group force. 
  The final activity of the wargame will be marked by the 
landing of the amphibian force on the island on March 29 which 
will be witnessed by Defence and Security Minister General Edi 
Sudrajat and the Armed Forces commander-in-chief, Gen. Feisal 
Tanjung. 
  For the first time, three non-military ships, namely a 
tanker 
of the state-owned Pertamina oil company and two ships of the 
Sea Transportation's Directorate General are being deployed in 
the wargame. 
  The participation of the non-military ships is considered as 
the initial stage of the implementation of the "Wawasan 
Nusantara", an archipelagic concept, and the "Hankamrata", a 
public security system which involves the whole national 
potentials. 
  The 23 warships participating the wargame consist of 
frigates, corvettes, patrol boats, minesweepers, submarines, 
tankers and landing ship tanks.

  [Text] Paris, March 26 (YONHAP) -- The representative of 
the North Korean general mission in Paris, Pak Tong-chun, 
commenting on possible U.N. sanctions against his country, says 
Pyongyang is prepared to go to war or resume dialogue on the 
nuclear issue. 
  In an interview with the daily LIBERATION, Pak said Thursday 
that the Korean peninsula is at "a negative turning point." 
  If the United States and its allies including France imposed 
economic and other sanctions, North Korea would regard it as a 
declaration of war, Pak said. 
  "As North Korea is ready to wage an all-out war, it is also 
ready to resume dialogue," he said. "This is not just idle talk." 
  He also threatened that a "catastrophic situation" would 
develop on the Korean peninsula if the United States and South 
Korea resumed their annual military exercise Team Spirit. 
  "Dialogue is always possible," Pak stressed, "but Team 
Spirit 
will have to be cancelled before it can take place." 
  U.N. sanctions against North Korea or deployment of Patriot 
anti-missile missiles in South Korea could force Pyongyang to 
withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, he added.

  [Text] Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and minister of 
the National Unification Board, said that he hopes that the 
North Korean nuclear problem be peacefully resolved through 
dialogue before the sanctions are imposed by the United Nations. 
However, if North Korea does not show any change in its attitude 
to the last and sanctions are inevitable, the government will 
work out all possible measures based on the international 
cooperation system. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Yi stressed this while appearing in 
the 
program, "Diagnosis of Policies" carried by KBS-1 television 
network. He said that although North Korea did not show any 
indication of military provocation, it intensified slander, 
propaganda, and instigation activities against South Korea. 
Thus, North Korea more clearly showed its line for communization 
of the South. He revealed that the ROK established a firm 
security posture in close cooperation with the United States, 
including 24-hour operation of the AWACS system. 
  Concerning the issue of the North Korean residents' escape 
to 
China, which was recently intensively reported by KBS, Deputy 
Prime Minister Yi said that this issue was related not only to 
the ROK and North Korea but also to China, and as a result of 
this, the exercise of the rights for diplomatic protection is 
very difficult. However, he said, the government will make 
diplomatic efforts to solve the issue at an early date.

  [Text] Mr. Yi Pok-hon (33, from Sinam 1-tong, Taegu), who 
was arrested on 8 March by the Agency for National Security 
Planning [NSP] on espionage charges and who was transferred to 
the prosecutor's office on 25 March, stated while being 
investigated: "It seems North Korea has succeeded in 
manufacturing nuclear bombs." This draws our attention as there 
is current suspicion regarding North Korea's nuclear weapons 
development. 
  The NSP disclosed this on 26 March when it transferred Mr. 
Yi 
Pok-hon to the prosecutor's office. Since he left the country 
in 1990, Mr. Yi has been engaged in spy activities overseas, in 
regions such as Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and 
China. Mr. Yi reportedly stated during the NSP investigation: 
When I went to North Korea in March 1993, a Mr. Ho, a senior 
North Korean Workers' Party cadre, asked me directly if it would 
be tactically advantageous to North Korea to announce openly its 
possession of a nuclear bomb or would it be better to keep it 
secret after the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. 
  The NSP also disclosed that Mr. Yi said that the said Ho had 
told him that North Korea intends to deliver an atomic bomb, 
whose performance had not been tested, to a certain country in 
the Middle East sometime during 1994.

  [Text] The government has reacted negatively to the 
Russian Government's proposal for an eight-party conference made 
up of the four powers involved in the Korean peninsula issue, 
North and South Korea, the UN secretary general, and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency director-general in order to 
smoothly resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  On 25 March, a relevant Foreign Ministry official indirectly 
refused the Russian Government's proposal, saying: "We believe 
we need to prudently review the proposal for the conference, 
which will include relevant countries, such as the United States 
and Japan, on the North Korean nuclear issue. It is more 
important, however, to be patient because the UN Security 
Council is now discussing the North Korean nuclear issue." 
  The official said that "the Russian Government had already 
informed the ROK Embassy in Russia of its intention to make the 
proposal before it was announced internationally." He added 
that "the Russian Government's proposal was likely made to 
resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, which has been recently 
deadlocked, through a multilateral approach."

<F P=106> [Report by Yim Chun-ung from UN Headquarters in New York] </F>
  [Text] According to information received from a UN source 
on 25 March, while discussing the adoption of a resolution 
urging North Korea to allow additional nuclear inspections, the 
United States, Britain, France, and Russia -- permanent member 
nations of the UN Security Council -- are now considering 
demanding that North Korea allow additional inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] within one month. 
  The source said: "The draft of the resolution prepared by 
friendly nations stipulates that 'the IAEA should report, within 
a month after it adopts a resolution on North Korea, if North 
Korea observes the Nuclear Safeguards Accord.'" It added: 
"This means North Korea is urged to allow additional 
inspections within one month." 
  The source also said: "If the UN Security Council decides to 
adopt this draft, North Korea must have consultations with the 
IAEA on the additional inspections within this period." 
  Prior to this, IAEA Director-General Hans Blix attended the 
UN Security Council meeting held on 25 March and said: "In 
order to maintain the continuity of nuclear inspections of North 
Korea, an IAEA inspection team has to enter North Korea again in 
six weeks to replace batteries and film."

  [Text] United Nations, March 26 (YONHAP) -- The U.N. 
Security Council retreated from a resolution to a statement by 
the council president in its first-step action on North Korea's 
nuclear issue due to China's opposition, officials here said 
Saturday. 
  "Chances are six to four that the action by the Security 
Council will be in a form of president's statement," said an 
official at the South Korean mission to the United Nations, 
"this change, after the council went as far as distributing the 
draft of the resolution, is intended to secure China's 
participation." 
  Chinese representative Chen Jian had spoken against adoption 
of the resolution at a closed-door council meeting on Friday and 
insisted on a president's statement instead with more weight on 
positiveness and objectivity, according to the officials. 
  The United States is somewhat neutral on whether it should 
be 
a resolution or a statement, but England and France are 
demanding a resolution. A heated debate is predicted at another 
closed-door session to convene on Monday. 
  But the contents, be it resolution or statement, will not 
differ significantly since the resolution from the beginning did 
not contain any sanction measures. 
  "Even if the council decides to issue a statement, the 
contents will not be much different from a resolution if it 
specifies the deadline on by when North Korea has to allow 
nuclear inspections, " the official said. 
  The five permanent members of the council moved quickly 
after 
Pyongyang denied access to a team of International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) inspectors to core sites of its suspected nuclear 
development earlier this month. 
  It was initially thought that the council would pass the 
resolution within this week giving North Korea one month to 
reallow IAEA inspection on the sites. 
  "China has indicated it is willing to participate if it's a 
council president statement," said the South Korean official, 
"it's important to include China in the council's action since 
sanctions are impossible without Beijing's cooperation." 
  "It's Seoul's position that it wouldn't mind whether it's a 
statement if it means China's participation," he said. 
  The situation is a repeat of April last year when the 
council 
opted for a statement instead of a resolution at China's 
opposition. 
  The president's statement is likely to come out this week, 
and the council will move up to a resolution if North Korea does 
not accept IAEA resolution by a set time, officials said.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 28 March 
carry articles and editorials on China's new proposal for a 
solution to the DPRK nuclear issue. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,800-word 
article by correspondent Kim Cha-un from UN Headquarters under 
the headline, "The Significance of the Alternative Plan on the 
'Statement in the Name of the President of the UN Security 
Council.'" 
  Noting that with the "new alternative plan" proposed by 
China 
on 25 March regarding the UN Security Council moves for adoption 
of a resolution on North Korea, discussion of the North Korean 
nuclear issue at the council has entered "a new phase," the 
article predicts that this proposal will bring about "a 
temporary stumbling block" in the West's plan to cope with North 
Korea in the future, and shows doubt as to whether North Korea 
will "obediently follow" the statement of the president of the 
UN Security Council which has no "binding force," unlike the 
resolution. The article also points out a possibility that this 
plan may "spoil" the atmosphere of the international community's 
"hardline measures" against the North Korean nuclear issue by 
giving North Korea time to drag on the issue. In spite of this, 
the article notes the recent Chinese proposal is winning "more 
affirmative reaction" by the West, and illustrates the reason 
for this as follows: First, with this proposal, one can sense 
that China's basic position on the North Korean nuclear issue is 
"changing" and that China agrees with the UN Security Council's 
"interference in and action" for the North Korean nuclear issue. 
Second, the West is hoping that such a change in China's 
attitude will exercise "a decisive influence" on North Korea, 
because China's supoport for a statement by the president of the 
UN Security Council means that China raises the "same voice" 
with the United States and other Western countries "opposing" 
North Korean nuclear development. Third, Western diplomats 
believe that China's "joining" in the efforts of the security 
council for a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue is 
"more important" than anything else. Thus, it is highly likely 
that the West will "accept" the Chinese proposal for adopting 
the statement of the council president during negotiations with 
the Chinese side next week. The article predicts, however, that 
the two sides will have a "tug of war" over the "contents" to be 
included in the statement. 
  The TONG-A ILBO also carries on page 3 a 1,300-word article 
by reporter Kim Cha-su, entitled "The Government's Position on 
the 'Alternative Plan Proposed by China.'" The article notes 
that the government showed an "affirmative reaction" to the 
Chinese proposal for adopting a statement to be issued in the 
name of the UN Security Council president because it believes 
that "winning support from China" is "more important" than 
anything else. The government hopes, the article writes, that 
the "same voice" raised not only by the five permanent committee 
members of the security council, including China, but also the 
10 non-permanent committee members, will work as even "greater 
pressure" on North Korea. 
  The article observes that the purpose of the Chinese side in 
proposing the statement is to give North Korea "room" to accept 
an "additional inspection" and that by doing this, China will be 
able to explain to North Korea that if North Korea does not 
"comply with" the demand of the international community, China 
can "no longer" stand only on the side of North Korea. The 
government, however, maintains that the "contents" of the 
statement proposed by China should not be "remarkably" different 
from "a draft resolution" pushed by the security council's 
permanent members including the United States, and that the 
statement should include a content clarifying that "next-stage 
steps" will be taken according to the North Korean "attitude," 
referring to the remarks of the IAEA director-general that if 
another inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities is not 
conducted within six weeks, safeguards are highly likely to be 
"suspended." The article points out that during the ROK-PRC 
summit in Beijing, the ROK will ask China to support the 
security council's resolution in return for the ROK's acceptance 
of the Chinese proposal. ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will 
bring the result of his talks with Chinese leaders to the United 
States and based on this, will discuss "measures" henceforth 
with the security council's permanent members, including the 
United States. 
  The TONG-A ILBO also carries on page 3 a 1,300-word 
editorial 
under the headline, "A Pitfall in the Resumption of Dialogue." 
Pointing to "affirmative" moves of the UN Security Council and 
the ROK Government concerning the new Chinese proposal, the 
editorial writes that with emphasis put only on the nuclear 
issue, the issue regarding "tension" between the North and the 
South Korea has been "put aside," and denounces North Korea's 
"persistent refusal" of inter-Korean dialogue and recent remarks 
on "Seoul becoming a sea of fire." The editorial says that there 
is a "high possibility" that North Korea's "antinational, 
menacing act" may be "overlooked" if North Korea expresses 
"readiness" to accept additional inspection, changing its 
attitude. But the editorial urges the North to "apologize" for 
its "abnormal acts" and to basically change its attitude, so 
that it may be recognized as "a dialogue partner." 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word 
editorial under the headline, "How Long Should We Put Up With 
the Statement of the Security Council's President?" The 
editorial notes that with China's proposal for a security 
council president's statement, the North Korean nuclear issue 
will likely return to the "condition of one year ago" because 
the North has not shown any change in its attitude, and 
expresses "doubt" as to whether the ROK Government's support for 
the Chinese proposal is "appropriate." Criticizing the 
government's "excessive appeasement attitude," the editorial 
stresses that the "stick," while not necessarily meaning 
"confrontation," is more effective for bringing North Korea to 
the dialogue table.

  [Text] Seoul, March 28 (YONHAP) -- Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong- tae said Monday that South Korean military power is 
superior to that of the North. 
  Yi wrote in the KUKJONG SINMUM, an administration newspaper 
for public servants: "The combat ability as well as performance 
of equipment of the South Korean military are superior to those 
of the North Korean military. And our scientific war 
performance system overwhelms the North Korean one. 
  "Even if North Korea misjudges the situation and provokes a 
full- fledged war, it will taste only miserable defeat. The 
joint South Korean and U.S. forces will win a decisive victory 
after all." 
  The government's overall policy, however, is to deter North 
Korea's development of nuclear weaponry while preventing war and 
solving the nuclear problem peacefully, although security on the 
Korean peninsula is subject to increasing tension. 
  "For the survival of the nation, we must keep the North from 
developing nuclear weapons. Moreover, the military should adopt 
a perfect defense posture to immediately meet any situation that 
might arise if the North Korean nuclear problem is not solved in 
a peaceful way." 
  On a promising note, he said the military has not found any 
signs of an imminent North Korean attack on the South. 
  "The reason why the North is threatening the South is that 
it 
wants to control the North Korean people, who are agitated over 
the economic crisis. The North is also trying to obtain the 
maximum concessions from the United States and disturb the South 
psychologically." 
  Yi added that the South Korean military has prepared a 
water- 
tight defense posture.

  [Text] On 28 March, Japanese SANKEI SHIMBUN published a 
report from Washington that (Neil Livingston,) an American 
expert in studies of terrorism, warned that there is a 
possibility that North Korea, when it invades the ROK again, 
will wage a harassing operation in the rear area of the ROK with 
chemical weapons which it has already hidden in the ROK. 
  According to SANKEI SHIMBUN, (Livingston) alleged this in an 
article entitled, "The Dangerous Area," contributed to a recent 
issue of the publication "Sea Power," published by the Navy 
League, an organization supported by the U.S. Navy. 
  Stressing that the North Korean leadership which triggered a 
war on the Korean peninsula on 25 June 40 years ago is the Kim 
Il-song system, (Livingston) said that "the ROK is very 
vulnerable to North Korean attack, and therefore, it is very 
clear that Seoul, the fourth largest city in the world 
approximately 60 km away from the Military Demarcation Line 
[MDL], will undergo enormous damages at the initial stage, 
whatever type of war may break out there in the future." 
  He estimated that if the ROK Army fails to check the North 
Korean Army midway, the North Korean fighters will reach Seoul 
within five minutes and tanks will pressure Seoul in its 
outskirts within an hour. 
  In particular, he assumed that North Korea has stored an 
enormous quantity of chemical weapons in the areas near MDL in 
the North Korean side of the Armistice Line, and will likely 
blow off the poison gas to South Korea in an emergency by taking 
advantage of weather conditions, including wind, and that some 
of these chemical weapons might have already been hidden in 
secret places in Seoul or other areas of the ROK. 
  SANKEI SHIMBUN wrote that this suggests the possibility that 
armed spies, who will commit a terrorist act with chemical 
weapons at the directive from Pyongyang, might have already 
infiltrated into Seoul, or the forces that blindly follow North 
Korea might already possess these weapons.

  [Text] Seoul, March 26 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has been 
harping on the possibility of war with the South in official 
statements and issuing one warning after another through the 
media, while intensifying its propaganda offensive against Seoul 
since the rupture of working-level inter-Korean talks last 
Saturday. 
  Pyongyang's threats against Seoul started with remarks made 
by the chief North Korean delegate to the failed eighth round of 
inter- Korean talks. 
  Chief delegate Pak Yong-su called the South's strong 
reaction 
to the North's refusal to allow full International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) inspections of its declared nuclear facilities "a 
renunciation of the special envoy exchange, a declaration of 
total confrontation and a declaration of war." 
  "We're fully prepared to counter words with words and swords 
with swords," he said. 
  When his South Korean counterpart expressed concern about 
the 
mounting tension in inter-Korean relations, Pak snapped, "Don't 
worry. Do you think Seoul is far away from here? Do you think 
the South will be safe when the North is inflicted with damage? 
Seoul is not far from here and when war breaks out Seoul will 
be a sea of fire." 
  The Workers' (Communist) Party newspaper, the NODONG SINMUN, 
blamed the South for the failed inter-Korean dialogue, saying in 
a commentary carried in the March 20 issue that Seoul had 
"virtually declared confrontation and war" when its delegate 
used wild language that provoked his counterpart at the meeting. 
  Radio Pyongyang warned in an interview program aired on 
Sunday that the situation would lead to another war on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  The chief North Korean delegate to the failed working-level 
talks on exchanging special envoys issued a statement Monday 
denouncing the South's strong steps including resumption of the 
"Team Spirit" military exercise with the United States. 
  Calling the measures "a renunciation of the special envoy 
exchange," he charged that the South is leading inter-Korean 
relations to the brink of war. 
  In a statement issued by the Committee for Peaceful 
Reunification of the Fatherland on Tuesday and in a commentary 
Radio Pyongyang aired the same day, North Korea harped on the 
danger of war while intensifying its propaganda offensive 
against the South -- even asking South Korean soldiers to 
disobey their superiors. 
  North Korea's leaders, while creating a sense of crisis 
among 
their people to put them on alert for war, are instigating South 
Koreans to overthrow their government and fight against America. 
  Radio Pyongyang urged, in a commentary also aired on 
Tuesday, 
that South Korean workers build a democratic government "on the 
grave of the reactionary government," recalling labor strikes in 
September 1946 and March 1947, according to the official North 
Korea watcher NAEWOE press. 
  It also called on South Korean students to rise up against 
the United States, reminding them of the student raid on a U.S. 
Embassy facility 12 years ago. 
  It said, "America is the root source of the South Korean 
people's sufferings, pain and unhappiness, and it is America 
that has heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula to increase 
the danger of war." 
  North Korea's threat of war aims at breaking the 
Seoul-Washington system of cooperation in dealing with the 
nuclear issue, analysts say. 
  The North had no intention of exchanging special envoys with 
the South even when it proposed the exchange last year. It was 
made simply to counter Seoul's proposal to form a joint 
North-South Nuclear Control Committee, according to the analysts. 
  This became clear when North Korea opposed including a clear 
provision on an inter-Korean special envoy exchange in the four- 
point agreement it reached with the United States in New York in 
February. The North Koreans simply agreed to resume 
working-level talks with the South Koreans on the exchange. 
  When North Korea denounced the inclusion of an exchange of 
special envoys as a precondition for the next round of 
high-level U.S.-North Korea talks, it showed its intention to 
break off the dialogue with an eye to excluding Seoul from its 
talks with the United States on the nuclear issue. 
  In this light, U.S. President Bill Clinton's letter to 
President Kim Yong-sam on Monday reaffirming America's defense 
commitment to South Korea dealt a blow to the North Koreans' 
wish to break up the Seoul-Washington cooperation system. 
  As before, North Korea's propaganda offensive against the 
South is designed to create social confusion in the South and 
spur South Koreans into anti-government and anti-American 
struggles. 
  North Korea also wants to maintain its political and social 
stability and solidify the position of Kim Chong-il as 
heir-apparent of President Kim Il-song by heightening tensions. 
  North Korea's propaganda tirade against the South is 
expected 
to intensify further when Team Spirit resumes and the IAEA steps 
up the pressure for additional inspection of nuclear facilities 
in North Korea.

<F P=106> [By reporter An Song-kyu] </F>
  [Excerpts] A conference of cell secretaries of the North 
Korean Workers Party will be held in Pyongyang late this month 
for the first time since the party was founded. 
  According to Article No. 42 of the Workers Party regulation, 
the party cell is the lowest organization composed of 5 to 30 
party members from 3-million party members working throughout 
plants, enterprises, cooperative farms, administrative 
organizations, public organizations and military. 
  Article No. 41 of this regulation stipulates the mission of 
the party cell as follows: The party cell is a combat unit of 
the party which unites the masses with the party and which 
directly executes the party's policy and lines among the masses. 
  The party cell secretaries are elected at a congress of the 
party cells which is convened more than once every month, and 
their tenure is one year. However, their total number has not 
been revealed. 
  The National Unification Board [NUB] noted that since the 
Workers Party was founded on 30 June 1949, the party congress 
was held six times, the party Central Committee meeting was held 
every six months, and party Political Bureau meetings, party 
Standing Committee meetings and party secretaries' meetings were 
held occasionally. However, the convocation of a conference of 
cell secretaries of the party is the first of its kind in the 
history of the Workers Party. 
  As this conference will be held for the first time, the 
people's attention is focused on the background of holding the 
conference. However, North Korea made public only the fact of 
holding the conference and stereotypical agenda for discussion. 
[passage omitted] 
  The NUB believes that this exceptional "conference of cell 
secretaries of the party" has something to do with the current 
situation strained surrounding the North Korean nuclear issue. 
In other words, North Korea will take advantage of the situation 
strained by the rupture of the North-South contact and by the 
moves of the international community for sanctions against North 
Korea for consolidating its system. 
  It is also likely that North Korea will stress the necessity 
of ideological struggle during the conference of cell 
secretaries of the party in a bid to prevent residents' wavering 
to be caused by economic difficulties in the event that the 
pressure is increasing on North Korea, thus attempting to 
disseminate the necessity of struggle to the people through the 
party's cell organizations.

  [Text] Following the shock remarks of chief North Korean 
delegate Pak Yong-su that North Korea was ready to wage war 
against South Korea and set Seoul aflame, the inter-Korean feud 
has become deeper than at any other time. 
  To make matters worse, North Korean criticisms against South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam and Kim's strong reactions against 
them have collided, resulting in an "emotional" tit-for-tat. 
  "Reneging on its promise not to slander or vilify each other 
(in the inter-Korean basic agreement), North Korea extended its 
time for anti-South Korean propaganda to 13 hours from 10 hours 
a day," Kim was quoted as telling military leaders in a 
luncheon meeting at Chongwadae [presidential offices] Tuesday. 
  He further criticized the North for remaining the same as it 
was 50 years ago in failing to keep promises, citing that the 
North Korean continued its nuclear weapons development program 
secretly even after it agreed to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. 
  The fresh recrimination between the two Koreas can be seen 
most clearly at the working-level contact on exchanging envoys 
at the truce village of Panmunjom March 19. 
  In front of the North Korean delegates at the inter-Korean 
talks, chief South Korean delegate Song Yong-tae read aloud a 
"bill of indictment" issued by the North Korean Committee for 
Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, a body in charge of 
South Korean affairs. 
  In the indictment dated Feb. 25, Pyongyang harshly lashed 
out 
at President Kim Yong-sam and called on the South Korean people 
to wage decisive battles against the government to overthrow it. 
  To the North Korean delegates, all of whom are associated 
with the committee, Song strongly demanded that the North 
withdraw the indictment and apologize in order to engage in 
further dialogue. 
  "If the contents of the indictment were true, wouldn't it be 
hypocrisy for you to hold a talk with our side here and now?" 
Song was quoted as saying. 
  Song's vigorous protest was in response to the North's 
renewed demand of the four preconditions it had set for the 
envoy exchange. The North had backed down over the preconditions 
at the sixth contact March 12. 
  Such a turnaround on the part of the South was mainly caused 
by the North's repeated and escalating criticisms against the 
Seoul government, especially President Kim Yong-sam, analysts 
say. 
  With the exception of the first 100 days after Kim took 
office late February 1993, North Korea has not ceased to slander 
the South's Chief Executive. 
  Regardless of these vilification, President Kim decided to 
try to improve inter-Korean relations by proposing a summit 
meeting with North Korean leader Kim Il-song early this year, 
but met with more high-blown slander, which billed his offer 
"the whining of a hooligan caught in a trap." 
  The North's continued mudslinging against the South was 
reported to have something to do with the President's complete 
about-face on North Korean policy from appeasement to hardline. 
  According to a report compiled by the National Unification 
Board (NUB), the North's number of slander against the President 
amounted to 1,000 during the past year. 
  "Recently, it has doubled, to eight to ten times on a daily 
basis," Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae said. 
  North Korea's verbal attacks against the southern leader are 
centered upon Kim's personality, his policies and remarks 
regarding the North. 
  In extreme cases the North called President Kim Yong-sam a 
"political whore," "civilian fascist wearing business suit," and 
"first-class poodle of Japan and the United States," to name a 
few. 
  That is why the South Korean chief delegate demanded that 
the 
North immediately stop slandering the President, during the 
eighth contact at Panmunjom March 19, where the North ruptured 
the talks by walking out of the meeting. 
  The North's slander against the South Korean President are 
due to the country's great worry over the Seoul-Washington joint 
strategy in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue, the NUB 
report analyzed. 
  The North Korean leadership must have reasoned that the 
close 
cooperation between South Korea and the United States would be a 
great stumbling block to the future negotiations between 
Washington and Pyongyang in resolving the nuclear issue. 
  Other reasons included the North's bid to maintain 
anti-South 
Korean hard-line sentiment among the North Koreans to calm 
discontent over its economic difficulty, and to weaken the 
President's popular support and instigate antigovernment 
struggles in the South, the NUB report analyzed. 
  However, many experts on North Korean affairs advised people 
not to be bothered with North Korean demagoguery, which stresses 
rhetoric. The government's North Korean policies should not be 
adversely affected by it they said. (LMH)

  [Text] Seoul, March 28 (YONHAP) -- Inter-Korean trade is 
taking root despite the heightened tension caused by the North 
Korean nuclear problem, the Korea Foreign Trade Association 
(KFTA) said Monday. 
  The realization ratio of inter-Korean trade -- the ratio of 
the amount of trade actually realized to the amount the 
government approved in advance -- reached an all-time high of 
93.9 percent last year, according to the KFTA. 
  The ratio was only 53.7 percent and 57.9 percent in 1990 and 
1991, respectively, before soaring to 81.2 percent in 1992. 
  A KFTA official said, "you can say the period between 1989 
and 1992 was a mock-up stage for inter-Korean trade, but from 
last year the trade entered into a stable period." 
  An official at Samsung Co., which recorded the most trade 
with the North last year, said, "South Korean investment in the 
North was put off after the inter-Korean working-level contact 
ruptured. But trade is still going on."

<F P=106> [Article by Pak Che-kyun entitled: "Preparatory Events for </F>
Kim Il-song Birthday Not Loud"] 
  [Text] Kim Il-song's birthday (15 April), which North 
Korea calls the greatest national holiday, is only a few weeks 
away. North Korea, however, does not appear as boisterous about 
it as it was in previous years. In previous years, various 
events to celebrate Kim's birthday, such as "the race to relay 
the letter of loyalty" would have already started. 
  On the contrary, North Korea issued an emergency alert order 
to the entire Armed Forces and is creating an atmosphere of 
tension, suspending the issuance of travel permits to residents, 
according to Kim Tok, director of the Agency for National 
Security Planning, who disclosed this at the security-related 
ministers meeting on 26 March. 
  Director Kim also said that the North Korean Army is 
checking 
the maintenance of its emergency communications network, while 
intensifying training. North Korea is stepping up the 
production of military supplies, such as military uniforms, 
according to some information officials. 
  Since the inter-Korean contact broke down on 19 March, North 
Korean broadcasts have been yelling: We will regard sanctions 
against us as a declaration of war. We will respond to war with 
war. 
  In particular, early this week North Korea will hold the 
national meeting of party cells for the first time in the 
"Workers' Party of Korea" history, with the participation of 
some 200,000 party cells. 
  North Korea is abruptly convening a national meeting of the 
party's frontline functionaries, while creating tension 
internally, because it is taking, apparently, extra precautions 
to prevent any crack in its system. North Korea must also want 
to demonstrate its resolute will externally. However, there are 
no signs of its provoking a war yet. 
  North Korea declared a semi-war state last year when the 
ROK-U.S. Team Spirit joint military exercise was conducted. 
Under this condition, attention is also focused on the rumor 
about a setback in Kim Chong-il's hereditary succession system. 
President Kim Yong- sam, interviewed by the ROK correspondents 
in Japan on 25 March, said that there seems to be some change in 
Kim Chong-il's succession system. 
  Rumors about difficulty in Kim Chong-il's succession system 
have circulated from time to time since Kim Tal-hyon and other 
aides of National Defense Commission Chairman Kim Chong-il were 
reprimanded last December. With the frequent exposure of 
confusion in North Korea's nuclear policy recently, observers 
predict that the North Korean officials working on nuclear 
policy, which Kim Chong-il has been in charge, might be replaced. 
  On this question, the position of the National Unification 
Board and other relevant authorities is that although Kim 
Chong-il's succession system is firm, its execution could be 
expedited or slowed down. However, they believe that if a 
problem arises in the succession system, there will be a serious 
whirlwind in the North and its aftermath can reach the South. 
  Therefore, we will be able to determine what is happening 
inside North Korea from the development of the party cell 
congress, preparations for President Kim Il-song's birthday 
celebrations, and the sixth session of the Ninth Supreme 
People's Assembly scheduled for 6 April.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Kim Chang-yong] </F>
  [Text] Top business leaders are knocking at the door of 
the Chinese market in time for President Kim Yong-sam's visit 
starting tomorrow, as they did in the past to create favorable 
atmospheres for presidential trips. 
  Kim Yong-won, chairman of Jindo Corp., and Kim Chae-sop of 
Youngchang Akki Co., a leading musical instrument maker, left 
for China yesterday. 
  Chairmen Pak Yong-kon of the Doosan Group, Chang Chi-hyok of 
the Kohap group and Yi Chun-yong of Daelim Industrial Co. are 
scheduled to fly to China today. 
  Bigger names including chairmen Chong Se-yong of the Hyundai 
group, Kim U-chung of the Daewoo group, Kim Sok-won of the 
Ssangyong group and executive vice chairman Cho Kyu-ha of the 
Federation of Korean Industries will follow in their steps this 
weekend. 
  Their visits are in the form of individual, personal trips 
as 
Chongwadae banned them from accompanying President Kim to show 
the severance between power and business. But all of them will 
join the president at two dinners in China, officials said. 
  Their headlong rush reflects their high hopes that Kim's 
visit may clear the way for closer economic and business ties 
with China, a socialist giant and emerging economic power. It 
contrasts with the presence of a few businessmen during his 
Japan visit. 
  Hyundai will move vigorously to get the Chinese central 
government to approve its plan to establish a joint venture 
company in Dairen capable of producing 300,000 autos a year. 
  It will also lobby Beijing to win a bid for the construction 
of a 1.5 billion-dollar multipurpose dam in Hainan, a Hyundai 
executive said. Hyundai, Korea's largest conglomerate with 
interests ranging from construction, to autos, is studying the 
feasibility of participating in a 20 billion-dollar project to 
build a dam on the Yangtse estuary. 
  Daewoo expects that it will sign a contract to set up a 1.5 
billion-dollar auto assembly plant in a joint venture with a 
Changchun, northern China, company with an annual production 
capacity of 300,000 units. 
  Daewoo has already presented a letter of intent in regard to 
that project under which it hopes to begin producing engines and 
other components in 1996 and fully-assembled cars two years 
later, according to its spokesman. 
  The Samsung and Lucky-Goldstar groups are leaning toward the 
telecommunications service area as China is considering Korea's 
total digital exchange system as the model for its network. 
  The Sunkyong and Ssangyong groups hope that the presidential 
visit, which entails various levels of talks between Cabinet 
ministers, ranking officials and businessmen, will be a boon to 
their projects. 
  Sunkyong and Ssangyong, the fifth and sixth chaebols, are 
seeking the Chinese government's go-ahead to their plans for a 
1.5 billion- dollar oil refinery in Shenzen and a huge cement 
plant capable of producing 600,000 tons, respectively.

  [Text] Beijing, March 28 (YONHAP) -- Communications 
Minister Yun Tong-yun, who is accompanying President Kim 
Yong-sam in China, and his Chinese counterpart Wu Jichuan signed 
a memorandum of understanding [MOU] on bilateral communications 
cooperation here Monday. 
  The agreement calls for Korean communication firms' 
participation in communications network-building in China and 
joint development of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM). 
  South Korean companies will join in a cable-laying project 
between Beijing and Guangzhou, communications network-building 
in Hunan Province and construction of the Chinese posts and 
Telecommunications Ministry's project for computerizing the 
financial market. 
  Meanwhile, Korean Ambassador to Beijing Hwang Pyong-tae and 
Chinese State Science and Technology Commission Minister Zhu 
Lilan signed an agreement Monday allowing Korean youth 
volunteers to work in China. 
  Seoul will send 12 volunteers to China in the second half of 
this year, with the number to rise further in the future. 
  Hwang and Zhu also signed a memorandum of understanding on 
exploring for minerals in Fujian Province. The Korea 
International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and the China National 
Nonferrous Metals Industry Corp. will perform a three-year 
feasibility study on the project. 
  Seoul will provide technology worth 1 million U.S. dollars 
for exploration work and, if profitable minerals are found, it 
will be given priority in development.

  [Text] Seoul, March 26 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung- chu is headed for the United States via Beijing for 
strategically important talks on the North Korean nuclear issue 
with Washington and the United Nations, the Foreign Ministry 
said Saturday. 
  Han goes to Beijing on Sunday to join President Kim 
Yong-sam, 
who is continuing his state tour of Japan and China, the foreign 
minister embarks on a separate trip to Washington, D.C., on 
March 29 and will shuttle back and forth between the United 
Nations until April 2 to negotiate the contents of the Security 
Council resolution on North Korea. 
  While in the U.S. capital, Han is expected to meet Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher and possibly Defense Secretary 
William Perry. 
  At the United Nations, he will confer with Security Council 
President Jean-Bernard Merimee. 
  The foreign minister stops off in Tokyo on his way home from 
April 2-4 for talks with his Japanese counterpart Tsutomu Hata 
and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  The Security Council is ready to adopt a resolution on the 
North Korean nuclear issue sometime next week, when it will 
likely demand immediate inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  Han has timed his visit to New York to coordinate with 
Security Council members on how the United Nations should deal 
with the nuclear problem. 
  In Washington, the foreign minister will need to discuss the 
fate of the South Korea-U.S. joint military exercise "Team 
Spirit," specifically whether and when to hold it this year. 
  South Korea and the United States, although they have 
recently taken a hard-line stance outwardly, are expected to 
discuss possible ways to bring North Korea back to the 
negotiating table.

  [Text] Seoul, March 27 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu reacted positively Saturday to a change of 
action by U.N. Security Council to issue a statement rather 
than adopt a resolution on North Korea's nuclear problem, saying 
it could be more effective. 
  On his way to Beijing to join President Kim Yong-sam on a 
China visit, Han said China cannot but go along with a future 
U.N. resolution if North Korea does not come forward even after 
the council statement. 
  "I believe it's advisable to start with a council 
president's 
statement so that a resolution can be adopted unanimously," Han 
said at an airport press conference. 
  "Even to induce North Korea to negotiations, it would be 
more 
effective to start low, like a president's statement, than to 
start high with sanctions," he said. 
  China's opposition to a resolution is pulling back what has 
been a swift movement at the Security Council to deal with North 
Korea who earlier this month refused access to suspected nuclear 
facilities to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
inspections. 
  "China's stance is to emphasize dialogue a little more 
before 
adopting a resolution," Han said. 
  The foreign minister heads to Beijing to join the president 
who is to arrive in Beijing later in the afternoon for a state 
visit. He then goes on a separate trip to the United States from 
March 29 to fly between Washington and the United Nations to 
coordinate future measures on North Korean nuclear issue. 
  He stops by Tokyo on March 3-4 before returning to Seoul.

<F P=106> ["U.S. Prepearing Immediate Air Force Deployment in Case of </F>
War"--YONHAP headline] 
txt}[Text] New York, March 26 (YONHAP) -- The United States is 
planning instantaneous deployment of ultra-modern fighter jets 
to South Korea and Japan in case of North Korean aggression, THE 
NEW YORK TIMES reported in its Sunday edition. 
  Secretary of Defense William Perry handed down instructions 
that include sending tactical aircrafts to South Korea within a 
day or two at outbreak of war, and the U.S. Air Force in Korea 
was ordered to increase its artillery and other supplies as 
backup, the paper said. 
  Only one of the three U.S. Air Force battalions stationed in 
Korea, comprised of 24 F-16s, can carry laser-guided bombs, 
according to the paper. 
  The U.S. decision to be prepared for armed conflict on the 
Korean peninsula was based on South Korea's physical distance 
from the United States and lacking scale of the U.S. forces 
there, it said. 
  Perry was quoted as saying that the United States will watch 
for another four to six weeks whether North Korea will allow 
international nuclear inspections before pushing for economic 
sanctions. 
  The paper went on to say China opposes a U.N. Security 
Council resolution, recommending instead a statement issued by 
the council president. 
  Washington could agree to the idea if the statement clearly 
indicates possibility of sanctions if North Korea ignores the 
warning about inspection demands, the paper said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Pressure on the ROK To Purchase Its </F>
Attack Weapons"] 
  [Text] As the North Korean nuclear issue, which was likely 
to be resolved through dialogue, has entered a phase of extreme 
confrontation, the United States is pressuring the ROK to 
purchase its ultramodern weapons, including anti-aircraft 
equipment, for increasing the ROK Army's military strength. It 
was reported that the United States has already begun to hand 
some weapons and equipment over to the ROK Army. 
  The U.S. media has particularly stressed the aggravation of 
the military situation on the Korean peninsula since October 
1993, when the United States and North Korea continued to hold 
contacts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. Reporting 
this, the U.S. media mainly quoted high-ranking officials of the 
U.S. Department of Defense. The U.S. State Department, which is 
in charge of contacts with North Korea, has been busy rather 
controlling the public heat caused by those reports on 
aggravated tensions that spread like wildfire. Watching this, 
our people suspected that the U.S. munitions industry has an aim 
to let the ROK purchase its weapons, taking advantage of the 
tense situation on the Korean peninsula, and that the U.S. 
Department of Defense and U.S. media are helping facilitate the 
realization of this aim. They harbored this suspicion although 
they had experienced a fratricidal war, and though they were 
well aware of the significance of the words, "Forewarned, 
forearmed." 
  Our people, who want the North Korean nuclear issue to be 
resolved in a peaceful way, were vexed by reports carried in 
January on the U.S. plan to dispatch a national intelligence 
team to the ROK and to deploy Patriot missiles and updated 
Apache helicopters to U.S. forces in the ROK. This is because 
they know that the reinforcement of the ROK-based U.S. forces 
may further agitate North Korea, which is demanding that the 
United States and the ROK suspend the Team Spirit exercise to 
resolve the nuclear issue. The government showed a lukewarm 
attitude at that time toward the plan to deploy Patriot missiles 
to the ROK-based U.S. forces because it was aware of the 
people's anxiety. 
  The situation, however, has changed. The International 
Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] inspection of North Korean nuclear 
facilities ended in dissatisfaction, and the North Korean 
nuclear issue has been referred to the UN Security Council. 
Moreover, the North Korean chief delegate to South-North 
working-level contacts made remarks such as "no hesitation in 
bringing about war" and "sea of fire," agitating the people. 
U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry said in a news 
conference held on 25 March: "The reinforcement of the ROK Army 
is a matter of the United States' primary concern." He added: 
"The United States will recommend the ROK Army be equipped with 
gun-locating radar, Apache attack helicopters, and precision 
weapons for destroying guided tanks. Gary Luck, commander of 
U.S. Forces Korea, and the ROK Army are now holding intensive 
discussions on this matter." Of course, I think, his statement 
was made not only because of the North Korean delegate's remark. 
Secretary Perry also said that the Patriot missiles in question 
will be deployed to the ROK within a month. He explained that 
the United States originally planned to deploy the missiles in 
the second half of this year as a part of a long-term project of 
modernizing the Army, but it has decided to advance the date, 
regarding this as a prudent preventive measure. The Patriot 
missile is one of the updated weapons that the United States 
strongly "recommends" the ROK to purchase. 
  We are well aware that the United States is greatly 
concerned 
about North Korea's reaction to be shown in case the United 
Nations decides to apply sanctions against it since North Korea 
has stated that it would regard any sanction as a provocation. 
  As Secretary Perry said, however, there is no military 
crisis 
between the ROK-United States and North Korea. We are not under 
an emergency situation, in which a military crisis is likely to 
come soon, either. It is necessary, however, for the ROK and 
the United States to maintain an iron-tight defense posture in 
preparation for an emergency. On the other hand, the two 
countries should also continue to make efforts to resolve the 
nuclear issue through dialogue. The United States should not 
force the ROK to purchase attack weapons, taking advantage of 
the tensions between South and North Korea.

  [Text] The United States has been putting more pressure on 
the ROK to open the ROK's automobile market and asking the ROK 
to import corn flour and processed plums and allow 
advertisements for dog food. As a result, signs are showing 
that ROK-U.S. trade disputes will grow. 
  In particular, the United States is expected to try to 
extensively discuss the trade disputes between the two countries 
and step up its trade pressure on the ROK at the 16th ROK-U.S. 
working- level trade conference scheduled to be held in 
Washington on 4-5 March. 
  A ROK Government official concerned said on 27 March: "The 
United States has complained about the ROK's 10-percent tariff 
on imported U.S. cars, saying it is too high. It has strongly 
asked the ROK to lower the tariff and remove such non-tariff 
barriers." 
  He also said: "The United States is expected to warn the ROK 
that it could renew the Super 301 trade provision and take other 
retaliatory measures if the ROK did not accept its demand at the 
Washington working-level trade conference. 
  This official went on to say: "The U.S. Carmakers 
Association will send a large delegation to the ROK in mid-April 
to ask the ROK to open its automobile market. Also, it has 
asked the U.S. Government to take retaliatory trade measures if 
the ROK does not open its car market any wider." 
  At the 20th regular ROK-U.S. Trade Council meeting held on 
23 
March in Seoul, the United States asked the ROK to allow imports 
of corn flour and reprocessed plums and advertisements for dog 
food. It also asked the ROK to reclassify imported vitamins for 
pets and raised an objection to the ROK's inspection of the 
viscera of pigs. 
  The United States also raised an objection to the ROK's 
practice of allowing heat-treated frozen U.S. sausages to be 
sold in ROK markets only within 30 days after they were 
produced. It asked the ROK to allow them to be sold up to 90 
days after they were produced.

  [Text] Seoul, March 28 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry's 
Armed Forces special inspection group, starting early next 
month, will examine large-scale construction projects being 
carried out under the force improvement plan codenamed Yulgok. 
  The inspection, in line with a government-wide move to stamp 
out irregularities related to state-funded construction 
projects, will focus on how Yulgok projects were awarded to 
civilian contractors, whether they are proceeding as scheduled 
and if there are any irregularities, ministry officials said 
Monday. 
  Most of these projects were launched as long-term 
undertakings under a tight security lid and thus have not been 
inspected over the years. 
  The first-time inspection will be extensive in covering many 
Yulgok construction projects and put particular stress on 
checking whether project officials have taken bribes, an 
official said.

  [Text] Japan, the European Union, and other members of the 
OECD shipbuilding committee have recently urged Korea to 
reconsider its plan to expand shipbuilding facilities, citing a 
renewed global "overcapacity," officials at the Ministry of 
Trade, Industry and Energy said yesterday. 
  The demand was aired to the Korean delegation during the 
latest March 14-18 negotiations under the auspices of the 
Council Working Party 6 of the Organization of Economic 
Cooperation and Development, which wound up without any 
agreement. 
  The EU and Japan, in a joint statement to the full session 
of 
the OECD group March 17, voiced deep concern that the negative 
consequences of a renewed "overcapacity following the Korean 
government's decision to remove a temporary ban on capacity 
expansion by Korean shipbuilders." 
  "An increase in capacity of Korean shipbuilders, which would 
in no way be justified by the reality of the market, would 
seriously undermine the purpose of the Revised General Guideline 
for Government Policies in the shipbuilding industry and the 
shipbuilding agreement currently under negotiation to aim at 
ensuring a balanced market for a return to normal competitive 
conditions," said the statement made available here. 
  It recalled that "such an increase existed in the 1970s and 
1980s where, at a time of deep crisis, when a majority of 
producing countries were reducing substantially their 
capacities, important new capacities were installed in Korea." 
  In another statement to the shipbuilding session, the United 
States called for Korea to clarify its intention to neither 
contribute to the planned expansion nor extricate the industry 
from any difficulties that expansion may cause in future. 
  The Korean delegation explained to the member countries that 
Korea's shipbuilding rationalization program, introduced in 
1989, expired at the end of 1993 as scheduled, but not the 
Korean government's lifting of restraints on facility expansion 
by Korean shipbuilders as claimed by other members, according to 
the ministry officials. 
  Korean delegates said the Korean government is now promoting 
deregulation and market-opening measures, and it is now finding 
it difficult to take any action against private investment 
plans, they said. 
  Explaining the negotiations to reporters, a ministry 
official 
said Korea promised to the participating member countries that 
the Korean government would not provide any financial support in 
honor of the multilateral shipbuilding regime of the OECD and it 
could not bail out any Korean shipbuilders even if they suffered 
financial difficulties caused by their expansion plan. 
  An estimation, made by Japan and the EU, that the global 
shipbuilding supply will exceed demand by 7 million to 9 million 
gross tons to 26 million gross tons in 1995, has yet to be 
verified, however, he said. 
  The official said local shipbuilders appear to be following 
overblown expansion plans because of local rivalry, adding that 
the government would work out countermeasures after a 
cooling-off period it said is needed to cool down competition 
among them. 
  The ministry will ask local shipbuilders to refrain from 
excessive competition and inform them that the government will 
not take any relief measures in favor of ailing companies, he 
said.
