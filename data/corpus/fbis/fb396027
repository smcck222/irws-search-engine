  [Text] An official who requested anonymity said that King 
Norodom Sihanouk has granted an audience to two officials of the 
royal government to discuss a "serious matter." These two 
officials are also due to report to the king on the latest 
developments in the royal government's activities. 
  The two officials are Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut, 
deputy 
prime minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, 
and Sam Rangsi, minister of economy and finance. The prince 
deputy prime minister and the minister left Phnom Penh on 22 
March. 
  It is worth noting that the trip to Beijing by Prince 
Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut and Sam Rangsi was made hot on the 
heels of the 22 March visit to the king by Samdech Hun Sen, 
second prime minister, and the return from Beijing of Samdech 
Chea Sim on 21 March. All these visits were not announced 
officially. It is not known what the issue is that the 
officials referred to as a "serious matter." However, analysts 
have focused on an important issue, namely the alliance between 
the two big parties, the Cambodian People's Party and FUNCINPEC 
[National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, 
and Cooperative Cambodia]. 
  There is happy news, that is, the king has been discharged 
from Beijing hospital. His spokesman told the REUTER Beijing 
correspondent that "the treatment was successful; the king can 
walk and do other things." Western diplomats in Beijing said 
that after his cancer treatment the king has lost his hair but 
put on weight. 
  The king plans to travel to Pyongyang at the end of March 
and 
then to Cambodia on 8 April.

  [Text] Kanazawa, March 26 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Saturday [26 March] he will consider whether Japan 
can set up "objective criteria" as a way to slash its huge trade 
surplus with the United States. At a press conference here, 
Hosokawa said he would like to take enough time to consider 
whether it could be possible to incorporate objective criteria 
into a package of measures to cut Japan's 60 billion dollar 
trade surplus with the U.S. 
  Washington has been pressuring Tokyo to whittle down the 
lopsided trade surplus by setting up objective criteria, such as 
numerical targets to gauge foreign access to the Japanese 
market. Japan, however, is opposed to the idea, saying it would 
lead to managed trade. 
  The bilateral "framework" talks in Washington in February 
broke down due to differences over the matter. 
  As for domestic politics, Hosokawa said he wants to promote 
his plan to establish a study group within the coalition, saying 
it is important for coalition partners to fine-tune common ideas 
to fight elections. 
  Hosokawa's plan to form a study group involving all seven 
coalition parties is believed to be a preliminary stage before 
establishing a new party to fight off the leading opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party in the next general election. The 
coming election is likely to be held under a new system mixing 
single-seat constituencies and proportional representation.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 28 KYODO -- Two major Japanese 
automakers announced Monday midterm global business programs 
designed to boost automobile and auto parts imports and promote 
cooperation with foreign makers. 
  Toyota Motor Corp., the industry leader, said its plan aims 
to increase worldwide procurement of parts and materials to 9.70 
billion dollars in fiscal 1996 from 6.30 billion dollars in 
fiscal 1992. The company said its purchases from U.S. 
suppliers, including imports to Japan, will account for 6.45 
billion dollars, up from 4.43 billion dollars in fiscal 1992. 
  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said its program for international 
cooperation calls for procurement and imports from U.S. 
suppliers at a maximum of 2.07 billion dollars in fiscal 1996. 
The company said it will promote localization of its global 
vehicle production and boost overseas production to 700,000 
vehicles in fiscal 1996 from 520,000 in fiscal 1993. 
  Its U.S. production base, Diamond-Star Motors in Normal, 
Illinois, will aim to boost the value of local procurement to 
1.40-1.63 billion dollars in fiscal 1996 from 650 million 
dollars in fiscal 1993, the company said. 
  The local content ratio of vehicles produced by Diamond-Star 
Motors will rise to 80 percent or more in 1996 from the current 
level of about 70 percent, it said. 
  The company said its worldwide imports of auto parts will 
rise to 870 million dollars in fiscal 1996 from 680 million 
dollars in fiscal 1993. 
  Toyota said its basic policy is to increase overseas 
production to raise the portion of locally assembled vehicles in 
total sales overseas. 
  In line with this, the company said its production overseas 
will be raised by about 50 percent to 1.35 million to 1.40 
million vehicles by the end of 1996 over the 1993 level of 
890,000. The company said its wholly owned U.S. car plant will 
double its output to 400,000 vehicles from 200,000 while its 
production in Britain will increase from 37,000 in 1993 to 
100,000 in 1994. 
  Both Toyota and Mitsubishi said they will strengthen 
cooperation with local automakers and parts suppliers.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- Coca-Cola (Japan) Co. 
said Friday [25 March] it has been accused of failing to 
declare a total of about 37 billion yen in income from 1990 
through 1992 but that it will appeal the assessment. 
  Japan's National Tax Administration Agency claims Coca-Cola 
(Japan) failed to report income gained in Japan and, instead, 
paid the income to its parent firm, the Coca-Cola Co., as 
royalties, the firm said. 
  The tax agency claims the royalties paid by Coca-Cola 
(Japan) 
to its parent firm over three years were higher than usual, the 
firm said. 
  It has imposed an additional tax of about 15 billion yen on 
Coca- Cola (Japan), the firm said. 
  Coca-Cola (Japan) issued a statement saying it is 
dissatisfied with the assessment and will seek consultations 
between the Governments of the United States and Japan. "The 
matter will now be reviewed by the United States and Japanese 
tax authorities under the treaty signed by the two nations to 
prevent double taxation," the statement said. 
  "The royalties we pay are fair and reasonable given the 
unmatched value of Coca-Cola Co.'s trademarks, manufacturing, 
marketing and know-how," said Roi Suzuki, executive vice 
president and director of Coca-Cola (Japan). 
  "In the 40 years we have operated in Japan, we have always 
paid our taxes in full and in strict compliance with Japanese 
laws. In fact, Coca-Cola (Japan) Co. is today the single 
largest taxpayer among foreign affiliated companies in the 
country," he said. 
  Coca-Cola (Japan), founded in 1957, is financed entirely by 
Coca-Cola Export Co. and has a 35 percent share in Japan's soft 
drink industry. It declared 49.4 billion yen in income to 
Japanese tax authorities in December 1992.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA March 26 -- Malaysian Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamed gave a dinner in Kuala Lumpur yesterday evening 
in honour of Vietnam's party General Secretary Do Muoi now on an 
official friendship visit to Malaysia. 
  At the dinner, the Vietnamese party leader said: 
  We have had very profound impressions of Malaysia and its 
people. A few decades ago, Malaysia was known merely as one of 
the world's largest producers of rubber and tin. Today, it is a 
country with an advanced manufacturing industry and is striving 
to become an industrialized nation according to plan `Vision 
2020'. We are also deeply impressed by the fact that the 
economic development here has been closely linked with the 
promotion of the rich national culture in an atmosphere of 
harmony among different ethnic groups of a unified community. 
Malaysia has also been known for its initiatives for peace and 
cooperation among nations, especially among the regional and 
developing countries. 
  Allow us to share the pride of the people of Malaysia in 
their great achievements in national construction and sincerely 
wish Malaysia prosperity and the Malaysian people happiness. We 
are firmly convinced that the industrious, dynamic and creative 
people of Malaysia, under the clear-sighted leadership of your 
excellency the Prime Minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, and the 
other leaders of the national alliance, will certainly bring 
about prosperity for Malaysia and make important contributions 
to the common prosperity of our region as well as of the whole 
of Asia and the Pacific. 
  After nearly half a century of arduous struggle to defend 
our 
national independence, sovereignty and unity, the Vietnamese 
people are now doing their best to build their fatherland, 
striving to become 'a rich people, a strong country, and an 
equitable and civilized society'. In renewing ourselves for 
that lofty goal, we have made very important achievements: 
production is up inflation repelled the people's living standard 
making one step toward improvement social situation stable and 
foreign relations ever broadened. [sentence as received] These 
achievements are providing us with the premise to bring our 
country into a new phase in which we will make a step forward in 
our industrialization and modernization. We are fully conscious 
that this is not a simple work. However, with the tradition of 
dauntlessness in struggle and industry in production, the 
Vietnamese will certainly succeed in building a prosperous 
country and a plentiful and happy life, contributing a worthy 
share to the prosperity of the whole region. 
  Our two countries are indeed close, both situated by a rich 
and beautiful sea.Our two peoples share many similarities in 
culture and history and a past of being colonized by foreign 
powers and having struggled undauntedly and persistently for 
national independence. Today, we also share the aspiration for 
peace and cooperation and the strive toward development and 
prosperity, and toward peace and stability in the region. These 
are the solid foundations for our friendship and long-term 
cooperation in the interest of the prosperity of each country, 
and of cooperation and development in South East Asia. We note 
with satisfaction that owing to the efforts by both sides over 
the past few years, we have forged a bilateral relationship full 
of fraternity and mutual understanding and trust. 
  Our many-sided cooperation has also developed quickly and 
favourably. We are sure that this trend will now continue to 
grow fruitfully for the benefit of both countries. A new proof 
is the exchange of views full of openness, friendship and mutual 
understanding that we have had with your excellency the prime 
minister and other leaders of Malaysia.

<F P=106> ["Partiality Not Yet Removed"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 27 (KCNA) -- If the Secretariat of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) fails to take a 
measure to revoke its unwarrantable "resolution", we will have 
no other choice but to adopt a practical step corresponding to 
the extension of its partiality, says MINJU CHOSON in a 
commentary today. Recalling that at a time when the situation 
on the Korean peninsula was being aggravated by the anti-DPRK 
moves of the United States, the agency Secretariat adopted at a 
recent meeting of its board of governors an unfair "resolution" 
urging the DPRK to "promptly allow" all inspection activities of 
the agency equivalent to the full implementation of the 
safeguards agreement, which went beyond the inspection for the 
continuity of the safeguards, and submitted it to the United 
Nations Security Council, the news analyst of the paper says: 
  The adoption of such a "resolution" is an improper act 
blatantly twisting the fact and another pressure kickup to 
attain a sinister purpose. 
  The agency Secretariat must know that the DPRK is in a 
unique 
position after the temporary suspension of the effectuation of 
its withdrawal from the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  When it adopted another unreasonable "resolution" against 
the 
DPRK at the meeting of its board of governors on the basis of an 
unrealistic, wrong conclusion, the agency Secretariat revealed 
once again to the world that it had cast away the principle of 
independence and impartiality. 
  The United States and the agency Secretariat following it 
will have to bear full responsibility for all the consequences 
arising therefrom.

  North Korea said that if the UN Security Council takes steps 
to impose sanctions on North Korea, it will regard these steps 
as a declaration of war and that it will take a practical step 
corresponding to the IAEA Secretariat's unfairness if the IAEA 
does not withdraw its resolution.

  [Text] On 25 March, one day before President Kim Yong-sam's 
China visit to seek China's active role in resolving the North 
Korean nuclear issue, nuclear experts in Beijing said North 
Korea is moving its nuclear facilities under suspicion through 
connecting underground passages to other places in Pyongyang. 
  Meanwhile, Beijing sources anticipate that, although 
President Kim will try to induce China to play an active role in 
resolving the North Korean nuclear issue during his five-day 
visit to China by using the ROK's economic strength, China will 
not immediately change its position on the issue.

  [Text] Geneva, March 23 KYODO -- The successor to GATT, 
the World Trade Body, will set up a panel on trade and the 
environment, according to a draft accord obtained Wednesday. 
The draft, obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE, says the panel's job 
will include examining links between trade and the environment, 
charges and taxes for environmental purposes, and ways of 
settling disputes. 
  Negotiators are to meet in April in Marrakesh, Morocco, to 
sign the final accord on the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade 
talks. 
  The seven-year talks were concluded in December, when it was 
provisionally agreed to replace the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade, under whose auspices they were held, with a World 
Trade Organization (WTO). 
  Despite a proposal that panels to be set up by the WTO 
should 
include one on the environment, developing countries were 
concerned that industrial countries might use environmental 
concerns as an excuse to adopt protectionist measures. 
  In an apparent bid to ease such concerns, the panel's remit 
will include looking at the effect of environmental measures on 
market access, sources close to the negotiators said. 
  The committee will report to a ministerial meeting after two 
years, and that meeting will decide whether the panel should be 
kept or disbanded, the draft shows. 
  The sources said the draft will be confirmed at the trade 
negotiation committee of GATT next Wednesday, and will be 
formally signed by ministers of the negotiating countries in 
Marrakesh.

  [Text] Hanoi, March 26 KYODO -- Some 50 former diplomats, 
politicians and academics from 15 countries Saturday [25 March] 
opened a three-day conference to explore steps to ease tensions 
over such trouble spots as the Korean peninsula and the Spratly 
Islands. Attendants at the annual Williamsburg Conference 
include representatives of Japan, China, Taiwan, Russia, South 
Korea, the United States and other countries. 
  Organizers said the agenda includes such sensitive issues as 
the sovereignty of the Spratly Islands, which are rich in 
natural resources, whose ownership is claimed, either in whole 
or in part, by China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan, the Philippines 
and Brunei. 
  The meeting is co-chaired by former U.S. Secretary of State 
Cyrus Vance and former Japanese Ambassador to Washington Yoshio 
Okawara and other officials. It marks the first time that 
Vietnam has hosted such a large-scale unofficial conference. 
The move followed the U.S. announcement February 3 to lift the 
trade embargo against Vietnam. 
  The sovereignty of the Spratly Islands is so fiercely 
contested that it triggered a brief naval battle in 1988 between 
Vietnam and China. The conference follows an accord between the 
two countries last December to reconcile their differences over 
the issue. 
  The Williamsburg Conference was first called in 1971 in 
Williamsburg, Virginia, under the initiative of John D. 
Rockefeller III.

<F P=106> ["Text" of speech by Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir </F>
Mohamed at the opening of the 10th International General Meeting 
of the Pacific Economic Co-operation Council in Kuala Lumpur on 
22 March] 
  [Text] The economies that are represented here at the 
Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) have a total Gross 
National Product (GNP) of more than US$12 trillion. This is two 
times bigger than the total GNP of the European Union. It is 
three times bigger than the total GNP of the rest of the world. 
No less than three-fifths of the wealth of the entire global 
community is generated by the economies represented in this room. 
  In purchasing power parity terms, the figures are even 
bigger. The United States is the world's largest economy. China 
is the world's second largest economy. Japan is the world's 
third largest economy. Indonesia is the 12th largest economy in 
the world. 
  It is a matter of historical record that every economy in 
Pacific Asia was not too long ago considered a domino or a 
domino-to-be. We were seen in the same way that so many 
countries in Africa are seen today. Economies with little hope. 
Beset by problems that obviously could never be solved, 
cultures that surely would weigh us down, handicaps that would 
inevitably reduce many of us to life with a begging bowl. 
  South Korea was seen in this light. Indonesia before the 
arrival of President Suharto was seen in this light. Thailand, 
Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and even Japan. Even China. You 
name it. We were all, at one time or another during the 
post-war years, assumed to be societies with little hope. 
  Now, almost without exception, we are all regarded as 
dynamos. 
  Imagine the possibilities of a Pacific of such enormous 
verve 
and vitality, of such enormous wealth, of such enormous 
diversity, of such enormous talent, of such enormous synergistic 
potential! Imagine what we can do together -- for ourselves and 
the rest of the world -- if we can put our act together, if we 
can together build a true community of cooperative peace and 
mutual prosperity. A community worthy of the name of the Ocean 
whose waters lap our shores, worthy of the hard-working people 
who sweat and toil in the lands that rim the Pacific. 
  Some of us have been energised by the Pacific potential long 
before some of the present champions of the Pacific recognised 
the vitality of the super-region and awoke to its immense 
possibilities. 
  Malaysia was the first in ASEAN to join the Pacific Basin 
Economic Council (PBEC). In May this year, Malaysia will be 
hosting, with pride the International General Meeting of the 
PBEC, to which I am strongly committed. For the last seven 
years, Kuala Lumpur has played host to the Asia Pacific 
Roundtable, a security forum which for the first time in Pacific 
history brought together all the friends and foes of the Pacific 
into a process of talking and reasoning together. In June this 
year, this attempt at community-building in the Asia Pacific 
will meet for the Eighth Asia Pacific Roundtable. 
  On this day, Malaysia is proud to host the 10th 
international 
conference of the Pacific Economic Co-operation Council. I have 
been informed that this is the most high-powered 
non-governmental international conference ever held in the 
Pacific. 
  I particularly welcome former President Aylwin of Chile and 
Prime Minister Goldenberg of Peru, the secretary general of 
UNCTAD [UN Conference on Trade and Development] and the deputy 
secretary general of the OECD -- and all who have come from 
across this vast ocean. 
  I am a great respecter of what some have called "this vision 
thing". There is of course a great danger in grand idealism 
wedded to grand illusion. Great visions can sometimes get in 
the way of the day-to-day things that we must do today, that are 
urgent, that brook no delay. 
  But there is no virtue in activity without purpose. There 
can be little satisfaction in mileage without milestones and 
distance without a destination. There is no sense in getting 
quickly to places we do not want to go. 
  I am a Malaysian nationalist (something that some people do 
not like). As a Malaysian nationalist, in common with most 
Malaysians, I have a clear sense of direction and of directions 
for Malaysia. 
  I am also an Aseanist. Far too many ignorant people today 
underestimate ASEAN. It has been central to our post-colonial 
past. It will remain central to our future. Indeed, I confess 
without any sense of guilt that I will fight every impulse, 
contain every force and confront any danger that will damage or 
destroy the ASEAN family. For this, I make no apology. I 
express no reservation. 
  At the same time, I am a Southeast Asian and an East Asian. 
As a Southeast Asian, I am proud that we have, together, been 
able to turn a battleground into a marketplace. A Southeast 
Asian neighbourhood of warmth and friendship has to be tended 
and nourished. 
  As an East Asian, I am committed to the building of an 
East Asian community in which our common peace is cooperatively 
constructed and our common prosperity is cooperatively built, an 
East Asian community in which the giants of our region -- China. 
Japan, Indonesia -- shall have their rightful place, discharging 
their rightful responsibilities, all of us living in harmony in 
an egalitarian community of mutual respect and mutual benefit. 
  As a global citizen, my country must play an active role in 
the making of a new world community based on egalitarianism, 
mutual respect and justice. We will do what has to be done, 
even if there is a price to be paid. 
  As a fervent believer in the need to enrich and strengthen 
Pacific interdependence and cooperation I also believe that the 
nations of the Pacific, the business enterprises of the Pacific, 
the intellectual leaders of the Pacific -- all of us in the 
Pacific -- each in our own way, should work hard to contribute 
to the making of a productive community of cooperative peace and 
prosperity in the Pacific. 
  There are two key words here. The first is "community". The 
second is "productive". 
  I believe that what we must build is a Pacific community 
that 
is robust and that will endure, not a temporary Pacific 
association of convenience, or a Pacific construct erected over 
a transient enthusiasm -- or a Pacific club or organisation with 
a single purpose or interest, an appendage to someone, something 
that is here today and gone tomorrow. 
  In the jargon of sociology, the German word gemeinschaft is 
used to refer to a social relationship based on affection, 
kinship or a sense of community, "as within a family or a group 
of friends". The German word gesellschaft, on the other hand, 
is a relationship based on law, adherence to rules and 
regulations and to duty as within a structured organisation. I 
believe that what we must build is a Pacific Gemeinschaft, a 
Pacific village or family or group of friends, not an 
artificial, Cartesian construct -- over-legalistic, 
over-structured and over-institutionalised. 
  If this is our vision, obviously we have more to learn from 
the patient wisdom of our traditional culture, the stamina of 
the long-distance runner and the simple brick-layer who builds a 
house brick by brick, than the philosophy of Rene Descartes and 
the most magical builder of the house of cards. 
  The eager and the enthusiastic have to understand the 
enormous diversity of the Asia Pacific. In some of our 
cultures, friends are made in the course of a day. But for most 
of us, given our cultures, it takes time to become true friends. 
  A dozen years ago, in the very early stages of the Pacific 
movement, at a conference on the Pacific in Bali, I stated: "Tak 
kenal, maka tak cinta." We did not yet know each other. How 
could we be expected to be firm friends? Over the years some 
strangers have begun to know each other much better. But there 
are new strangers who must be made our firm friends. 
  The eager and the enthusiastic have to understand that not 
so 
many months ago, some of us of the Pacific were prepared to 
throw megatons at each other, to kill hundreds of millions of 
each other's citizens. 
  Clearly, the Asia Pacific journey to full trust, empathy and 
respect is a journey of a thousand miles, with very few safe 
short-cuts. There are no bullet trains. We must be prepared 
often to go on foot, despite the inconvenience. 
  So many ties have to be established, so many webs have to be 
weaved, so many chasms have to be bridged. The work -- so full 
of frustrations -- has to be done with patience and with 
persistence. Rome was not built in a day. A true Pacific 
community cannot be built in a decade. We must think in terms 
of decades. We must find the stamina to stay on the course. 
  We must understand at the same time that the building of a 
true community cannot be a monopoly of bureaucrats or 
Governments meeting intermittently. It can only be built by a 
million hands, working everyday and every hour of the day. 
  Indeed, right or wrong, it is the private sector, the 
business person pursuing growth and profit (not officials armed 
to the teeth with the best of intentions, laws, regulations, 
frameworks and authority, or politicians and statesmen who strut 
the great stage of international play) who have the greatest 
contribution to the making of the Pacific economic community. 
It is the intellectual and media leaders, like so many of you 
in the audience, who must help to build the needed community of 
the mind and of the heart. 
  APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation], properly 
structured, has of course a most important place and a most 
important role. But those APEC members who wish to measure the 
Pacific spirit and the Pacific commitment purely in terms of 
being macho on APEC, are misguided. 
  There is a role for PECC to play, for PBEC to play, for 
PAFTAD [expansion unknown] to play, for the ASEAN Regional Forum 
to play, for the ASEAN dialogue process to play, for all 
subregional forums to play. 
  We contribute to Pacific interdependence and 
community-building when we improve our bilateral relations. We 
contribute when we improve neighbourly relations and foster a 
peaceful neighbourhood and a flourishing one. All have to be 
part of this multi-layered, multi-dimensional process of Pacific 
community-building. 
  To ensure the "productive" community that we need, it is 
essential that we establish an egalitarian Pacific community, 
not a hegemonic Pacific community. 
  Let me say it for Malaysia: we cannot accept a Pax Sinica, 
we 
cannot accept a Pax Nipponica; we cannot accept a Pax Americana. 
Not now and not in the future. Instead, we believe in the 
establishment of a Pax Pacifica; a Pax without an imperium, 
without a protector, and without an overlord. We believe in an 
egalitarian community. 
  Most obviously, China is not Canada or Chile. Japan is not 
Hong Kong or Mexico. Even within the closest family, there are 
older brothers and sisters. Power and size will have their 
inevitable play. But this must be within an egalitarian 
framework of mutual respect and mutual benefit. 
  Egalitarianism is not an illusion founded on departure from 
realities. Nor does it deny the need for leadership. The 
leaders must lead. But leadership, too, must be within the 
framework of mutual respect and mutual benefit. 
  I believe that it is also important to ensure a Pacific 
community that is democratic and consensual and that works on 
the basis of democratic and consensual principles -- however 
frustrating democracy is; however, infuriatingly difficult 
consensus may sometimes be to secure. 
  We should also be strongly committed to the objective of 
making sure that the Pacific community that we build conforms to 
the imperatives of open regionalism. This of course is a 
central theme of this conference. 
  Before I proceed to say a few words on open regionalism, I 
hope we can all proceed on the same basic premise. Is there any 
doubt that the first best option is not open regionalism but 
open globalism? 
  This entire planet should be a single market place, a single 
trading bloc, with as few obstacles and distortions as possible 
to the freest and least managed exchange of goods and services. 
Can we not all agree that global free trade like democracy -- 
with all the inherent imperfections -- is by far the best 
option, ensuring the greatest good for the greatest number? 
  I used to think that we all agreed that the command economy 
makes economic nonsense in the international economic system, 
just as it makes economic nonsense within the domestic economic 
system. Now some seem to question this. Is it the system or is 
it the people? Most handle the free market as badly as the 
closed market. 
  There can surely be no question about the fact that economlc 
regionalism is a reality of life that will not go away. In the 
years since World War II, more than 55 regional trading 
arrangements have been submitted to GATT for its examination. 
  Australia and New Zealand were the pioneers in the Pacific. 
In 1965, they launched the first NAFTA, the New 
Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The latest ramification 
is the 1983 Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations 
Trade Agreement or ANZCERTA. 
  Regional trading blocs -- which by definition are regional 
trade groupings which have a common set of market access 
conditions among member economies which are not accorded to 
those outside the bloc -- have been implemented or tried in 
every area of the world, except in Northeast Asia. Except for 
the Northeast Asian members of APEC, all APEC members are 
already involved in one or more regional trading blocs. 
  The ASEAN countries will have AFTA [ASEAN Free Trade Area]. 
The United States, Canada and Mexico have NAFTA. 
  Given that trade blocs are not going to go away and may even 
proliferate, it surely requires statesmanship of the highest 
calibre to ensure that they will be as open as possible to 
non-members and that they will positively contribute to global 
liberalism rather than global protectionism. 
  The Uruguay Round negotiations have come to something of a 
conclusion. We will have to wait and see just how meaningful 
that conclusion is. I happen to think that those who believe in 
trade liberalism will continue to have a fight on their hands 
against the forces of protectionism. Those who believe in open 
regionalism, too, have a fight on their hands. 
  PECC has the San Francisco Declaration on Open 
Regionalism upon which it can build, and from which it can sally 
forth as a champion of open regionalism. It, obviously, has an 
important role to play. And its tripartite nature gives it the 
comparative advantage to fully develop the doctrine and the 
legitimacy of open regionalism. 
  In May last year, at the opening of the 26th International 
General Meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic Council in Seoul, 
I stated my view that all those who claim to be examples of open 
regionalism must pass two tests. The first is the test of 
intent. The second is the test of outcome. 
  The first test requires that the members of a regional 
enterprise pursue their regional undertaking not with the 
purpose of raising the ramparts and manning the barricades, but 
with the intent of liberalising the conditions for economic 
intercourse between themselves and with the intent of reducing 
the barriers to economies outside the regional trading bloc. 
  This is a very rigorous test. The entire European experience 
from the European Coal and Steel Community, through the Treaty 
of Rome and Maastricht, fails the test of intent. The desire to 
open to those outside need not be the primary intent. But the 
desire must be there. 
  As for the test of outcome, I believe it demands that what 
actually results is trade liberalisation within the regional 
grouping. In addition, the barriers to outside economies must 
actually be reduced. 
  If these two tests are passed, there is no doubt that open 
regionalism will indeed be a contributor to the open global 
trading system that I believe we must fight for. 
  Earlier in my speech, I said I was a Malaysian nationalist, 
that I was an Aseanist, a Southeast Asian, an East Asian, a 
globalist and a Pacifican. 
  As a Malaysian nationalist, I want to open the economy of 
Malaysia even further. In the last six years, we have been 
growing around 8.5 per cent a year. We must exploit all the 
advantages that further liberalisation and openness engenders. 
The entire world has to be our marketplace. And we must draw 
in the entire world in the making of our Vision 2020 future. 
  As an Aseanist, I wish to see the ASEAN community open 
itself 
further, so that we will all become stronger, more competitive, 
and more prosperous. I am confident that AFTA will not only 
lower the internal barriers but also the barriers to outside 
economies. 
  As a Southeast Asian, I would like to see an open Southeast 
Asia. The course is set. The benefits are all too clear. 
  As an East Asian, I would like to see the flourishing of 
East 
Asian economic cooperation and interdependence, and East Asian 
open regionalism. I have no doubt in my mind that ASEAN's 
proposal for an EAEC [East Asia Economic Caucus] is an idea 
whose time cannot be denied. 
  As a globalist, I know we must fight against protectionism, 
managed trade and an international command economy. We must 
fight for liberalisation and free trade. 
  As a Pacifican, I urge you to dedicate the PECC and your 
countries to the cause of open regionalism in the Pacific. 
  I pray that you, during the course of this conference and 
the 
nations of the Pacific in the decades ahead, wlll indeed succeed 
in holding firmly to the cause of open Pacific regionalism and 
in finding the way forward. 
  We of the Pacific who generate three-fifths of the wealth on 
this planet owe this to our peoples and to the rest of mankind.

  [Text] Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines 
have signed an economic agreement which is expected to spur 
growth in the four countries. Philippine Trade Secretary 
Rizalino Navarro said the creation of the sub-regional grouping 
was a timely recognition and logical revival of centuries of 
informal economic ties among these countries. The signing was 
done in Davao City in the Philippines. 
  Navarro signed for the Philippines. The other signatories 
included Bapak Hartarto, coordinating minister for industries 
and trade of Indonesia, Pehin Datuk Abdul Rahman, Brunei's 
minister for industries and resources, and Malaysia's Tun Daim 
Zainuddin, coordinator for the growth area. He said under the 
agreement, Brunei will lead a study of air links among the four 
countries. Indonesia will lead a study of [word indistinct] and 
shipping services. Malaysia will supervise a study of joint 
tourism development, and the Philippines will study 
collaborative management of marine resources.

  [Excerpts] A delegation led by the Singaporean prime 
minister, Mr. Goh Chok Tong, arrived at Yangon [Rangoon] airport 
by special aircraft at 1235 for an official visit to Myanmar at 
the invitation of Senior General Than Shwe, chairman of the 
State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] of the Union of 
Myanmar [Burma] and prime minister. 
  The delegation was welcomed at Yangon airport by Sr. Gen. 
Than Shwe, SLORC chairman and prime minister; General Maung Aye, 
SLORC member, deputy commander in chief of defense services and 
army commander in chief; Vice Admiral Maung Maung Khin and 
Lieutenant General Tin Tun, SLORC members and deputy prime 
ministers; Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, SLORC secretary-1; Lt. Gen. Tin 
U, SLORC secretary-2; Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt, SLORC member, minister 
of religious affairs, and chairman of Yangon division law and 
order restoration council; Lt. Gen. Thein Win, minister of 
transport; Brigadier General Abel, minister of national planning 
and economic development; Brig. Gen. Myo Thant, minister of 
information; U Ohn Gyaw, minister of foreign affairs; U Nyunt 
Swe, deputy minister of foreign affairs; U Phone Myint, Myanmar 
[Burmese] ambassador to the Republic of Singapore; U Kyaw Myint, 
charge d'affaires of Myanmar Embassy in Singapore; Brigadier 
General Chin Siat Yoon, ambassador of Singapore; the dean of 
diplomatic corps and diplomats; and personnel from the Singapore 
Embassy. [passage omitted] 
  The Singaporean prime minister was accompanied by a 
29-member 
delegation including Foreign Minister Professor S. Jayakumar; 
the trade and Industry minister, Mr. Yeo Cheow Tong; and the 
labor minister and deputy defense minister, Dr. Lee Boon Yang. 
The delegation also include some 25 businessmen led by Mr. 
(L.L. Wu). 
  Singaporean Prime Minister Mr. Goh Chok Tong called on the 
SLORC chairman and prime minister, Sr. Gen. Than Shwe, at the 
Protocol Chamber at the People's Assembly compound at 1430. 
  Sr. Gen. Than Shwe hosted a dinner in honor of visiting 
Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and delegation at the 
Reception Hall at the Pyeithu Hluttaw Compound at 1900. 
  At the reception, Sr. Gen. Than Shwe delivered a speech and 
proposed a toast. He welcomed His Excellency Prime Minister Goh 
Chok Tong and said on this auspicious occasion the Myanmar 
people and the government extend cordial good wishes to the 
leaders and people of Singapore. He was pleased to note that 
your excellency has found the time to visit Myanmar in spite of 
having responsibilities, at home and abroad. Your excellency's 
current visit to Myanmar brings many significant elements which 
contribute to the strengthening of the traditional friendly 
relations between Myanmar and Singapore. He noted foremost 
among the imperatives is the consolidation of economic and 
technological cooperation even as Myanmar's economic 
opportunities are at the threshold of greater future promise. 
He went on to describe the Government of Myanmar as most 
encouraged to be provided with the opportunity to share the 
valuable experience and expertise of Singapore in its initial 
stages of economic development. He said, given time and 
opportunity, he was convinced that both sides will arrive at a 
mutually beneficially stage with greater openings for wider 
cooperation. He noted his expressions will not be complete if 
he did not put on record the most constructive vision and advise 
of Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew in providing an atmosphere of 
mutual confidence between the two countries. He said Myanmar 
will contribute its full share of contributions among the 
countries in the region leading to political stability and 
economic development of Southeast Asia. He then invited all 
those present to join him in a toast to the lasting friendship 
between Myanmar and Singapore; to the health and well being of 
the president of the Republic of Singapore, Mr. Ong Teng Cheong; 
to the health and well being of the prime minister, Mr. Goh Chok 
Tong; and to the health and well being of the distinguished 
guests present on the occasion. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Asked about the U.S. charge that Thailand has not 
made any serious efforts to solve the problem of prostitution, 
Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said that he had read the report on 
this matter from the Foreign Ministry. In fact, he noted, the 
United States has not made any criticism of Thailand. The 
government has established clear guidelines to solve this 
problem. He said: 
  [Begin Chuan recording] As a matter of fact, the United 
States has not criticized Thailand. The report disseminated by 
the news agency was inaccurate. I read the report early this 
morning. The government has established clear guidelines to 
deal with this problem, including the presence of foreign 
prostititutes in Thailand. Last week, the authorities 
reportedly arrested British prostitutes here. We do not want 
prostitutes from Burma or any neighboring countries coming to 
earn their living in Thailand. We are monitoring the problem 
closely. I forwarded this matter to the Interior Ministry, 
because whenever they bring this issue up they always charge 
that our police are profiting from the business. I am asking 
our police authorities to do something, because the problem 
really tarnishes our country's image. I believe that some 
policemen, not all of them, are corrupt. The allegations of 
prostitution in Ranong Province and that of hill tribes girls 
being lured into prostitution are partly true. After all, the 
report is about the human rights issue which happens to cite the 
problem of prostitution, not criticism of Thailand. I reaffirm 
that it is the policy of this government to make serious efforts 
to solve the prostitution problem. Give us some time. [end

  [Excerpt] THE United States should separate trade matters 
from issues of human rights, labour rights and the environment, 
according to Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Panitchaphak. 
These issues should be left to the international organisations 
that are already dealing with them, Mr Suphachai said. 
  Dr Suphachai was speaking at the 21st meeting of the US 
Information Service's annual economic seminar entitled 
"Regionalisation of Thai-US Economic Relations". 
  He told BUSINESS POST that it is possible to look at trade 
issues on their own merits by decoupling them from side issues. 
  "Trade should be treated on its own merits, linked with real 
macroeconomic issues, and side issues that are now coupled with 
trade such as human rights, workers' rights and the environment 
should be left to international organisations that are already 
dealing with them," he said. 
  He said a country that is trying to achieve greater economic 
development will try its best to improve standards of human 
rights and labour relations. 
  "Through trade development expansion we can facilitate the 
process of paying adequate attention to human rights 
development," he said. 
  If some of the major side issues are put in the forefront, 
such as the US linking of the Generalized System of Preferences 
with labour rights, it may not bring results in the end, he 
said. The GSP was conceived to help developing countries' 
exports by granting concession terms, and is not supposed to be 
linked with anything, he said. He said he understood the good 
intentions of the US administration which has a sense of 
humanity and is justifiably concerned with rights. But he 
questioned whether its policy is the most effective way of 
conditioning the whole world to move in that direction. 
  Dr Suphachai said the more we want to promote trade and 
economic relations throughout the world the more we must work 
toward depoliticising trade issues. This will benefit not only 
the private sector but also the newly emerging countries, as at 
least world economic growth will be more predictable than in the 
past, he said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Thailand and Cambodia yesterday agreed in principle 
to jointly develop areas which might be found by a joint 
committee to overlap, said Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri 
yesterday. 
  The committee will come under the framework of the 
Thai-Cambodian Joint Committee and will begin work at the same 
time as the demarcation work said a senior official. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong said after an hour-long meeting with his 
Cambodian counterpart, Prince Norodom Sirivut, that several 
committees would be set up to cooperate on such things as 
fisheries, investment, trade, and the exchange of technical 
personnel and senior officials. 
  "We're now ready to sit down and create a legal framework. 
We don't know the procedure but we'd like to solve problems in 
a peaceful way through joint development cooperation, not to use 
confrontation," said Prince Sirivut. 
  He said problems, including the Koh Kong incident and the 
refugee problem, between the two countries would be solved at a 
state-to-state level through the committees which would be 
established as soon as possible. 
  "We don't think the Koh Kong incident is a real-estate 
affair. We don't want local authorities to jeopardise our good 
relations." 
  Prince Sirivut said there was a lot of contradictory 
information and it was not appropriate to comment on this until 
both sides had held a common investigation. 
  "Situations can change. I hope his excellency (Prasong) will 
meet me again. We'll wait for the result." 
  The Thai government yesterday handed over 35 pieces of 
equipment used in vocation training involving machinery, 
electrical goods, electronics and steel-linkage, worth a 
combined 627,060 baht. Both foreign ministers witnessed the 
initial endorsement of a cooperation agreement between their 
Boards of Investment [BoI]. 
  The agreement was signed by BoI Secretary-General Sathaphon 
Kawitanon and Vichit It. 
  The agreement, to take effect in two years, will stress 
training activities, the exchange of information and investment 
promotion which will lead to more serious deals between the two 
countries, according to a BoI press statement. The initial 
agreement will be proposed for further approval by the two 
governments, it said.

<F P=106> [By Michele Cooper] </F>
  [Text] BANGKOK, March 28 (AFP) -- Cambodian Foreign 
Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut backed away from confrontation 
here Monday after accusing Thailand a day earlier of "forced 
repatriation" of 25,000 Cambodian refugees. 
  Prince Sirivut's stance surprised observers, who had 
expected 
him to follow up on his strong words in Phnom Penh Sunday, when 
he said the repatriation "is a human rights abuse from some 
people or Thai authorities.". 
  While Prince Sirivut was holding a one-hour meeting with his 
Thai counterpart, Prasong Sunsiri, in Geneva the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, condemned the 
repatriations. Some 25,000 Cambodians poured across the border 
at Ban Phakkat a week ago to escape fighting over the former 
Khmer Rouge stronghold of Pailin, which the Cambodian Government 
said it seized March 19. 
  Thailand started a three-day operation to repatriate the 
refugees last Friday, transporting them north to Sap Tali, from 
where they could cross into what the Thais said was a safe zone 
in Cambodia. The Thais refused access to independent observers, 
however, sparking criticism of its handling of the matter. 
  On Monday, Thailand's National Security Council [NSC] said 
the refugees who fled fighting a week earlier in northwest 
Cambodia had themselves chosen repatriation to a Khmer 
Rouge-controlled zone. 
  NSC Deputy Secretary Khachatphai Burutphat told reporters 
that all 25,000 had moved to a safe zone inside Cambodia 
opposite the Thai town of Sap Tali. 
  In Geneva, Ogata voiced "deep concern" at the move, saying 
she feared the refugees, mostly women and children, "could be 
exposed to the fighting and their lives might be at risk." But 
Thai Government Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa dismissed her 
concern, telling AFP there was "no question of the Thai 
Government sending them to areas where their lives could be 
threatened." 
  Speaking to reporters after meeting Prasong, Prince Sirivut 
said bilateral committees would be set up to handle a whole 
range of issues, including refugees. Asked repeatedly about the 
border situation, Prince Sirivut said several times that the 
committees, to be set up "as soon as possible," would deal with 
all matters. 
  Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Suwit Simasakun said the two 
ministers had not even touched on the specific issue of the 
25,000 refugees. 
  Government Spokesman Aphisit said the refugee problem had 
also not been raised when Prince Sirivut met Prime Minister 
Chuan Likphai. The two sides dealt with framework issues for 
future relations, he said. 
  In Phnom Penh Sunday, Prince Sirivut has said: "It is not 
normal that the Thai authorities take this decision to send 
25,000 people without security, with nothing we can check." 
  A decidedly upbeat Prince Sirivut said Monday he was pleased 
the two sides had "resolved a lot of problems today." 
  Cambodia and Thailand "are ready to sit down and to create a 
legal framework to resolve problems state-to-state. We decided 
to solve problems in a peaceful way," he said, adding: "We 
don't want any local people to jeopardize our good relations." 
  In Geneva, Ogata commented that she was "particularly 
saddened that contrary to early information, (the Thai) 
government has not allowed these to stay in Thailand until such 
time as a return in safety and dignity could be worked out by 
all concerned." 
  Aphisit said Thailand had been forced to act because "we 
were 
finding it difficult to provide the necessary assistance keeping 
them where they were."

  [Text] A report from correspondents about the repatriation 
of Cambodian refugees who fled the fighting in Cambodia into 
Thailand's village of Ban Phakkat in Khlong Yai, Pong Nam Ron 
District, Chanthaburi Province, says that the Chanthaburi-Trat 
border task force completed the repatriation at about 1800 on 26 
March. The mission was fraught with difficulties due to lack of 
familiarity with the roads and terrain. 
  The repatriation of over 20,000 Cambodians who ran away from 
the fighting between the Cambodian Government and Khmer Rouge 
forces for control of Pailin in Battambang Province was made via 
Sap Tali town in Soi Dao District, Chanthaburi Province, about 
40 km north of Ban Phakkat. The people were sent back in a 
convoy of military GMC trucks and 10-wheel trucks provided by 
Thai mine operators. Some traveled by their own motorcycles. 
The mission was reportedly carried out with difficulty due to 
the long journey and winding roads. Many vehicles overturned or 
had accidents. Some lost their way and missed the border 
crossing point. 
  Speaking through interpreters, some Cambodians said they had 
to leave behind at Ban Phakkat some bulky belongings, such as 
power generators, television sets, video players, as well as 
motorcycles which had no gasoline. The people said they were 
returning with small valuables like jewelry and cash. Several 
pregnant women gave birth during the trip. Asked about food, 
the Cambodian people said they had no problem with a food supply 
because of the ample ration provided by Cambodian group leaders. 
  Correspondents said the 563d Company of Thai Marine Rangers 
was responsible for moving the Cambodians from Ban Sap Tali to 
an area about 1 km inside the Cambodian border. The refugees 
would then cross the canal and be met by Khmer Rouge rear 
guards, who will check the refugees and take a head count. 
  Regarding the evacuation of Pailin, there was a report that 
all civilian Cambodians had left Pailin. This included 
relatives of the Khmer Rouge leaders who had earlier left Pailin 
by cars and trucks. Those remaining in Pailin now are 
combatants who stand ready to resist the offensive by Cambodian 
Government troops.

  [Text] Army Spokesman Colonel Phalangkun Klahan said that 
some newspapers had presented reports accusing the Army of 
supporting the Khmer Rouge [KR], banning reporters and diplomats 
from visiting the border, and forcing the repatriation of 
Cambodian refugees. They also publicized photos showing 
relations between Thai and Khmer Rouge soldiers. The spokesman 
said the reports were untrue and were causing damage to the 
Armed Forces. He said that the Armed Forces upheld humanitarian 
principles and UN policy in assisting the refugees. It is the 
duty of the Cambodian Government to look after the refugees 
since they are Cambodians. He reaffirmed that the Armed Forces 
did not support the Khmer Rouge.

may be changed in accordance with government policy. 
  Suwit Wangli, the chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, 
said after discussions with Cambodian Economic and Finance 
Minister Sam Rangsi the Cambodian Government had confirmed the 
agreements would be honoured. But there may be some alterations 
to bring them in line with the Government's policies, he said. 
  Thai businessmen have invested heavily in logging and 
gemstone mining along the Thai-Cambodian border, much of which 
is under Khmer Rouge control. Such trade has caused chronic 
problems involving allegedly excessive profits and has been 
attacked by foreign newspapers over the years, said Mr Suwit. 
  "Thai investment in the central region of Cambodia does not 
generate similar problems and the ruling Government agrees to 
support those investors. At present, several drafts, including 
civil and criminal laws, investment laws and mortgaging and 
pledging laws are being globalised," said Mr Suwit. 
  "Besides, Thai investors have been requested to invest in 
labour-intensive industries, such as textiles and precious 
stones, to help relieve unemployment in Cambodia. The 
regulations and legislation ruling financial institutions under 
the central bank are also being strengthened," he said. 
  "Each day, at least two foreign institutions apply to open 
in 
Cambodia but the Government has not approved any since last 
year. It has decided to do so once the country's central bank is 
stabilised and well-monitored." 
  Prida Tiasuwan, the deputy chairman of the Jewelry and 
Ornament Association of Thailand, said the Cambodian Government 
charged only 1 percent and 20 percent for sales tax and 
corporate income tax respectively, while Thai law required sales 
(value added) tax of 7 percent and corporate income tax of 30 
percent. As a result, more and more Thai investors were 
attracted to Cambodia. But some obstacles are yet to be 
overcome for smooth mutual trade in the future. 
  Gemstone mining along the Thai-Cambodian border has not been 
legalised. Any trader can mine and take out stones at will as 
there is no legislation preventing them doing so which caused 
several problems in the mining areas. 
  Mr Rangsi agreed to take this matter into consideratlon.

for six G222 medium transport planes, a source in the ministry 
said. Aliniar said that though it is not able to take Thai

<F P=106> [Interview with Khachatphai Burutphat, deputy secretary </F>
general of the National Security Council, by unidentified 
correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Does the recent spate of bombings 
indicate the country is having a security problem? 
  [Khachatphai] There is no question that everyone wants the 
country to enjoy peace and progress and people to enjoy decent 
livelihood. The bombings, bomb threats, and creating of rumors 
have misled people into feeling that security is lacking. I 
wish to given the assurance that the country enjoys complete 
security. All the officials concerned have worked together 
closely to find the culprits and gather information to prevent 
the future occurrence of these problems. Security at various 
installations has been strengthened to prevent acts of 
terrorism. Everyone can be confident in the government 
mechanism dealing with this matter and in the officials 
concerned. 
  In any event, to better tackle the matter, people must 
cooperate by acting as informants. This will lead to the arrest 
of the culprits. This is one way of helping prevent untoward 
incidents. 
  [Correspondent] Does this mean that the performance of the 
officials concerned has not been effective? 
  [Khachatphai] One must realize that there are people who 
look for opportunities to create trouble. They will carry out 
their work whenever an opportunity arises. Therefore, it is 
difficult to absolutely prevent every problem. Intelligence 
operations and security vigilance have been responsible for 
preventing many incidents. These types of operations, however, 
cannot be publicized. So, people do not know about the 
performance of such operations. Therefore, it is unfair to say 
that officials have been ineffective. 
  [Correspondent] What are the causes of the bombings 
perpetrated by local or foreign elements? 
  [Khachatphai] There are many causes for the bomb attacks 
carried out by Thais. Among them are personal conflicts and 
deliberate attempts to create a situation. The officials 
concerned are investigating the causes. 
  Operations by foreigners concern acts of international 
terrorism. They carry out their operations in Thailand to 
achieve their objectives. The country's public safety is 
affected regardless of which group carries out its operation as 
innocent people suffer. Everyone should condemn such an evil 
operation. 
  [Correspondent] Do international terrorist groups pick 
Thailand for their operations because they find it easy? 
  [Khachatphai] Thai society, like in other liberal countries, 
is open. Tourists can travel where they please. Several 
million foreign tourists visit every year, in addition to more 
than 100,000 illegal arrivals. This is a weak point, but it 
does not mean that international terrorists pick Thailand 
because it is so easy to stage an incident. 
  [Correspondent] Compared with Singapore and Malaysia whose 
societies are also open, why do terrorists pick on Thailand to 
carry out their sabotage activities? 
  [Khachatphai] There are several factors international 
terrorists consider in choosing a country for their sabotage. 
One factor is their intended target. It is probably not true 
that security in those two countries is so good that it is 
impossible to carry out terrorist activities. The elaborate 
counterterrorist measures in the United States and the UK have 
not been able to completely prevent terrorist activities there. 
  [Correspondent] In addition to foreign terrorist groups, are 
there local groups which complicate the sabotage picture? 
  [Khachatphai] Possibly both. That is, there could be 
foreign terrorist groups which have targets in Thailand. 
Meanwhile, there are some local groups which aim to create 
public disorder. So, incidents affecting national peace and 
order could be created by any of these elements. Therefore, 
officials concerned must not relax and must be ready to prevent 
an incident and timely solve it if it happens. 
  [Correspondent] What about groups which seek to topple the 
current government? 
  [Khachatphai] The results of initial investigations have not 
linked groups seeking a political change to the disturbances. 
Normal incidents of disturbance are probably linked to personal 
disputes or to intimidation with some purpose in mind. 
Officials concerned are trying to verifying the causes. 
  [Correspondent] Is the intelligence work sufficient to cope 
with the current situation? 
  [Khachatphai] To date, I have found through working with 
military and civilian intelligence oficials that they have 
worked hard. Several pieces of intelligence have been exploited 
to timely solve the situation. However, current and future 
problems are diversified and complicated and, therefore, 
intelligence efficiency should be further developed to timely 
cope with the situation and keep up with the game. 
  [Correspondent] Do the currently numerous protests affect 
national security? 
  [Khachatphai] The administration system in Thailand is 
democratic and the government comes from the election. 
Therefore, if a group of people feels that it is not given fair 
treatment it has a right to express its views and inform the 
government so that the unfairness can be remedied. If a protest 
arise from the people's genuine hardship then it is not 
difficult to solve. But if there are instigators in the 
background it is more difficult. Therefore, I ask that people 
cooperate with the officials and act as their eyes and ears. 
The mass media has a role as well to help create a peaceful 
atmosphere by constructive reporting and avoiding emphasizing 
things that will excessively worry the public. 
  Although there are issues which affect peace and order, 
overall national security is good. Please have confidence in 
the state mechanism to protect and maintain national security.

  [Text] An article in an army newsletter, purportedly 
published to allay fears of a military coup, extols the virtues 
of coup-makers and suggests that the overthrow of a civilian 
government is still possible. 
  Meanwhile, Permanent Secretary for Defence Suwit 
Chantharapradit yesterday emphatically ruled out the likelihood 
of another coup, which he described as an idea "as extinct as 
dinosaurs". The article, entitled "Fear No Coup" and written 
under the pseudonym "Lt Col Tatthiam Yiamnakhon", argues that 
contrary to popular belief, the armed forces' hunger for power 
is not the main cause of most government takeovers. 
  "The notion that coups were caused by over-ambitious 
soldiers 
is an unscientific explanation because military officers never 
covet the power to rule. All of them only want to defend the 
country against outside threat," the anonymous writer claims. 
"Rather the main cause of most coups were shortcomings on the 
part of the country's democratic system," he says. 
  The writer says military men never initiated a coup but were 
asked by the government's opponents and disempowered groups, and 
members of the public. 
  "Other warning signs were harsh criticism by the mass media 
and a show of frustration by academics," he says.

Khmer Rouge. 
  Cambodian Government forces launched a major offensive 
against Khmer Rouge-held territories earlier this month.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, March 28 (AFP) -- The ultra-nationalist 
Khmer Rouge said Monday it was willing to work for a negotiated 
settlement of Cambodia's civil conflict after the fall of its 
"capital," Pailin, to government forces last week. 
  "We are going work for a negotiated settlement," in Sopheap, 
a representative for the guerrillas in Phnom Penh, told AFP. 
  The comments contrasted with a combative statement made 
earlier Monday by Khmer Rouge radio. 
  The Khmer Rouge representative could not confirm rumors 
circulating here that the guerrillas' nominal leader, Khieu 
Samphan, would soon be arriving in Phnom Penh. 
  Cambodia's co-Prime Minister, Hun Sen, told AFP Monday that 
the government "left the door open" to negotiations with the 
Khmer Rouge. 
  Cambodian government forces launched a major offensive 
against Khmer Rouge-held territories early this month either to 
flush out the guerrillas or force them to the negotiating table. 
  The government, elected under UN-sponsored elections in May 
1993, wants to take back full control of the country to 
establish stability and enhance international investment and 
spur the economy. 
  The Khmer Rouge has demanded representation in the 
government, but has refused to give up its weapons or cede areas 
under its control, which are mostly along the border with 
Thailand. 
  Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk, who was treated for cancer 
in Beijing the last six months, is expected to return to Phnom 
Penh April 8 and hopes to restart negotiations with the Khmer 
Rouge, said the country's foreign minister, Prince Norodom 
Sirivut. 
  The negotiations were suspended in mid-January, but Hun Sen 
added, "Our position has not changed. We are keeping the door 
open. We are also thinking of the possibility of a meeting when 
the king (Sihanouk) returns." 
  Hun Sen said: "The Royal Cambodian Government is ready to 
join the discussions." 
  But a representative of the "hardline" anti-Khmer Rouge 
faction said, "I am not sure if the (Khmer Rouge) problem can be 
resolved." 
  The offensive against Pailin was decided in concert with the 
Sihanoukists, represented in the government by Prince Norodom 
Ranaridh, co-prime minister, and supporters of Hun Sen. 
  Hun Sen said, citing military sources, that former Khmer 
Rouge chieftain Pol Pot, who still controls the guerrilla 
movement of 8,000 soldiers despite his official retirement, was 
with the group's leaders in the village of Kum Reang, a few 
kilometers (miles) north of Pailin, during the government 
offensive. 
  "They left two days before the fall of Pailin," he said, 
without saying where they were headed. Pailin, the Khmer Rouge 
stronghold near Thailand, fell on March 19, according to the 
government, or March 22, witnesses at the scene said. 
  Khmer Rouge leaders have veiled themselves in almost total 
secrecy since the group's founding in the early 1960s. 
  About 85 Khmer Rouge soldiers were killed in the defense of 
Pailin, Phnom Penh said. Government losses, without official 
estimates, are estimated at several dozen killed or wounded. 
  Pailin, rich in rubies, has helped finance the rebel 
movement 
since 1989 with contracts from the Thai business community.

  [Text] Phnom Penh AKP March 28 -- At lease four people were 
wounded during a hit and run-attack by Khmer Rouge last week in 
Bavel District, Battambang Province, said provincial police 
source. 
  The source said in the afternoon of March 22, some 150 Khmer 
Rouges divided in three groups launched attacks against 
positions of government troops Division 6, the district town of 
Bavel, and position of government troops' Regiment 18. 
  The guerrillas retreated at 6 P.M. the same day leaving 
three 
killed, the source said, adding that the attacks were the fifth 
one since the beginning of February. 
  The same source said before retreating the guerrillas hit a 
government arms warehouse in Bavel, blowing up the stocked 
ammunition, and stole villagers' belonging. 
  Armed clashes between the government troops and the Khmer 
Rouge broke out the same day in Kdol Tahen commune (Bavel 
District), and in the district of Battambang, killing eight 
guerrillas, the source said without elaborating the government 
army's casualties.

  [Text] On 22 March, the people and National Army of 
Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] attacked the command post of the 
puppets' 6th Division located at Kompong Chhnang and Bavel 
villages and swept the enemy troops from Bavel District seat 
which were a part of the two-headed government's invading forces 
in the Pailin area. 
  The people and NADK launched the attack in four prongs: the 
first coming from Dangkao Ta Mang to Bavel; the second from 
Samlor Khlanh to Bavel; the third from Ta Em to Bavel; and the 
fourth from Kbal Thnal to Prey Totoeng and Bavel. 
  After three hours of combat, we smashed and seized full 
control of the 6th Division's command post and Bavel District 
seat. We killed 22 enemy soldiers and wounded over 30 others. 
We destroyed a T54 tank; 85-mm, 122-mm, and 76.2-mm cannons; 
two 37-mm anti-aircraft guns; an 80-mm mortar; a DK-85; a 
12.7-mm gun; an RPK gun; an RPD gun; and 35 military barracks. 
We also set ablaze three depots storing various ammunition and 
mines for use in the Pailin offensive. The fire burned for six 
hours from 0500 at dawn to 1100. We also seized four B-40's, a 
12.7-mm gun, 39 AK's, three crates of AK ammunition, 60 B-40 
rockets, two field radios, and a large antenna. 
  At the same time, we attacked the invading forces at Thmar 
Kol which is the supply route for serving the Pailin 
battlefield. The invading forces were routed and forced to flee 
to Battambang which was then in chaos. The puppets in 
Battambang were in a panic and immediately declared a dawn to 
dusk curfew which is still being imposed.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- Foreign political 
parties and organizations have bitterly denounced the perfidious 
act of the United States in reversing the agreed conclusions 
reached between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and 
the United States at the New York contact and bringing the 
situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. 
  The Central Committee [C.C.] of the Jordanian Communist 
Party 
in its March 24 solidarity message to the C.C., the Workers' 
Party of Korea said the United States reversed the New York 
agreement, fully revealing its aggressive design to render the 
situation strained and perpetrate a provocation on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The Brazilian Communist Party issued a statement on March 
24. 
  Noting that the United States was driving the situation of 
the Korean peninsula to the brink of war by foiling the third 
round of the DPRK-U.S. talks and seeking the resumption of the 
"Team Spirit" joint military exercises and the deployment of 
Patriot missiles in South Korea, the statement said this is a 
premeditated provocation to isolate and stifle socialist Korea. 
  The Spanish Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification, 
the Organizing Committee of "the Espano-Coreano Koryo Friendship 
and Cooperation Association" and the Spanish Committee of the 
Organization of Solidarity of the Peoples of Africa, Asia and 
Latin America released a joint statement on March 22. 
  Pointing out that a grave situation has been created again 
on 
the Korean peninsula by the U.S. perfidious act in reversing its 
agreement with the DPRK, it condemned the bellicose and 
irresponsible attitude of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency, which is serving the imperialists and the United States. 
  The Russian Association for Friendship and Cultural 
Cooperation with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a 
statement March 24 said the situation of the Korean peninsula 
has been further aggravated because some quarters of the United 
States and Japan have not given up the intention to stifle the 
DPRK, and the United States, taking advantage of its predominant 
position in the IAEA, has reversed the DPRK-U.S. agreement, put 
all manner of pressure on North Korea and worked to impair its 
authority in the international arena and finally suffocate the 
socialist system of this country. 
  The Zimbabwean Association for Solidarity and Friendship 
with 
Korea, the General Confederation of Trade Unions of Yemen and 
the Secretariat of the Democratic Youth League of Ghana, too, 
issued statements urging the United States to stop threatening 
the DPRK.

settlement of the situation of the Korean peninsula which has 
been further strained by the manoeuvres of the U.S. imperialists

solved peacefully, not develop into an armed conflict. He added 
that Indonesia would support the efforts of all sides concerned 
to avoid confrontation and find a peaceful solution of the 
nuclear issue. 
  In a joint statement published on March 26, seven members of 
the State Duma of Russia including V. Ilyukhin, chairman of the 
Security Committee of the State Duma who is member of the 
Federal Communist Party of Russia, said some quarters of the 
United States were again straining the situation by raising new 
unreasonable conditions. They urged that all measures should be 
taken to continue the talks to maintain peace on the Korean 
peninsula, instead of resorting to pressure with strength. 
  Anzuluni Bembe, first vice-president of the Transitional 
National Parliament of Zaire-the higher council of the Republic, 
held that the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula should be 
settled in a peaceful way. 
  Thomas Ronstrom, co-chairman of the Nordic Cooperation 
Committee for Friendship and Solidarity With the Korean People, 
in a statement March 23 said inconsistent reports spread by the 
western media show their partiality against the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea, and it is an act of blindly 
following only the false argument of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA]. 
  Alexandru Mica, chairman of the Romanian Promoting Committee 
for Supporting the Reunification of Korea, and Faustin Justin 
Zabe, national first secretary of the youth of the Congolese 
Socialist Party, in their solidarity messages, and Jose 
Fanequico Lissane, executive secretary of the Mozambican 
Committee for Friendship With the People of the DPRK, in a 
statement stressed that the United States and some quarters of 
the IAEA Secretariat should apologize for their diabolic crimes 
against the Korean people and mankind and observe the principle 
of impartiality.

<F P=106> ["Korea's Stand for Fair Solution of Nuclear Issue </F>
Supported" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- Party and state 
leaders of different countries expressed support to the DPRK's 
stand towards the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula when 
they met with Korean ambassadors. 
  Salmin Amour, second vice-president of the United Republic 
of 
Tanzania and Zanzibari president, confirmed support to the stand 
of the DPRK in their efforts for a fair and smooth solution to 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  Klaus Riis, chairman of the C.C. [Central Committee], the 
Communist Party of Denmark (Marxist-Leninist), said that just 
is the stand taken by the DPRK to cope with the grave situation 
in which the situation of the Korean peninsula is growing acute 
due to the perfidy of the United States. "We express our full 
support for and solidarity with this stand," he pointed out. 
  He stressed that there is no more important work at present 
than to launch the solidarity movement for supporting Korea on a 
worldwide scale. 
  Indrajit Gupta, general secretary of the National Council of 
the Communist Party of India, said his party condemned the U.S. 
imperialists for scheming to isolate and stifle the DPRK, taking 
issue with the "nuclear inspection". 
  He confirmed full support and solidarity to the Workers' 
Party, the government and the people of Korea in the valiant 
struggle against the challenges of the enemy. 
  Siale Bileka Silvestre, prime minister of Equatorial Guinea, 
said that the U.S. action evidently proved it had no willingness 
to resolve the nuclear problem and was resorting to the 
premeditated moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK, taking 
advantage of a lever of the DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  The step taken by the DPRK Government this time is just, he 
said. 
  Ali Alatas, foreign minister of Indonesia, told reporters 
that dialogue is important in solving the nuclear problem in the 
Korean peninsula and the present crisis should not be aggravated. 
  The National Assembly of Zambia, in a note to the DPRK 
Embassy, expressed its support to all efforts of the DPRK to 
realize the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- Feelings of reverence 
for the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il are daily growing among 
South Korean people and soldiers of the puppet Army, according 
to the Seoul-Based Radio Voice of National Salvation [VNS]. 
  Yi Suk-kyong, a teacher of a high school in Inchon, when she 
was asked by her students at the geography lesson which is the 
strongest country in the world, replied that she thought it is 
the North. She further said: 
  Whether a country is strong or weak does not depend on the 
size of its territory, population and the level of arms 
equipment. 
  The North is so strong because it is under the guidance of 
General Kim Chong-il, a peerless famous general. 
  He is a great brilliant commander of varied attainments with 
literary and military accomplishments and iron will. 
  It is a great fortune and pride of our nation that we have 
held General Kim Il-song, a legendary hero of the anti-Japanese 
armed struggle, and General Kim Chong-il, another matchless 
general, together in high esteem. 
  A university professor in Taejon said with a strong emotion 
to his students: 
  General Kim Chong-il is the great master of military affairs 
who has developed the People's Army into unrivalled ranks by 
unfolding a new chapter of army building. 
  A First Lieutenant Kim of the 27th Division of the puppet 
Army said to his colleagues: 
  The Yankees try to kindle a war against the North. But we 
must live with our own minds. 
  No army on earth equals the People's Army which has 
developed 
into a one-match-for-a-hundred strong army under the guidance of 
General Kim Chong-il, the supreme commander with matchless grit, 
iron will and invincible stamina. 
  We must not serve the United States as its mercenaries but 
become genuine defenders of our country with General Kim 
Chong-il as the supreme commander of the national Army.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- The feelings of 
reverence for the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il are growing 
deeper among South Korean puppet Army soldiers. 
  Captain Kim of the 21st Division of the puppet Army, while 
conversing with his colleagues about the situation said the 
People's Army of the North guided by the greatest Commander 
General Kim Chong-il is a matchless army. 
  He noted: 
  "General Kim Chong-il endowed with military ingenuity by 
nature has reared the People's Army to be a highly disciplined 
matchless army. 
  "Officers-men unity, Army-people unity, arming of all people 
and fortification of the whole country--this is a true look of 
the North. No nuclear armed force can threaten the North with 
such strong national power." 
  After hearing him, a Second Lieutenant Choe said that the 
way 
for the nation to survive, the way of achieving reunification, 
preventing disasters of the nation, lies in that we hold the 
greatest Commander General Kim Chong-il produced by our nation 
in high esteem as the commander-in-chief of the national army. 
  A first lieutenant of the puppet Army told his colleagues 
that the "ROK" Army can be a genuine army of the nation and an 
independent army only when it is led by General Kim Chong-il 
with an early reunification of the country. 
  A private of a puppet Army unit surnamed Choe told his 
colleagues: "He has armed the Korean People's Army and made it 
a-match-for-a-hundred ranks by creating chuche-based military 
theory and tactics suited to the requirement of the modern war. 
Indeed, there is no such great statesman and military 
strategist as the dear leader Kim Chong-il in the world."

<F P=106> ["Jargon of Opponent to Dialogue" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
puppet Unification Minister, Yi Yong-tok, in "a KBS TV 
appearance" Sunday, reportedly let loose a string of 
hypocritical words about "dialogue" quite ill-matched to their 
bellicose moves. 
  This jargon of the opponent to dialogue is nothing but a 
foolish attempt to evade their responsibility for the collapse 
of North-South dialogue and justify the criminal war moves 
against the North, which are now increasing the tensions in the 
Korean peninsula. 
  It is an insult to and a mockery of the dialogue partner for 
the South Korean puppet clique to twang the harp of "dialogue" 
while bringing the situation of the Korean peninsula to the 
brink of war after unilaterally breaking up the working-level 
contact for the exchange of presidential envoys between the 
North and the South. 
  Yi Yong-tok said "if the UN sanctions are taken against the 
North, the South will adopt all measures needed for 
international cooperation." This revealed the invariable 
intention to isolate and stifle the North at any cost with the 
help of outside forces. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group must not act rashly, clearly mindful 
that going towards a war after closing the door of dialogue 
will, after all, tighten the noose around its neck.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- The puppet prime 
minister showed up at the "Seoul City Police Office" on March 27 
and ordered it to "maintain a perfect public peace and alert 
posture", according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  On March 26, while making a round of frontline units of the 
puppet Army, he incited war fever against the North, crying for 
a flawless "posture for countermove". 
  It cannot go unnoticed that the South Korean puppets are 
fanning confrontation with the North at a time when the 
perfidious U.S. warlikers are aggravating the situation on the 
Korean peninsula by threatening the resumption of the "Team 
Spirit" joint military exercises this year and ordering the 
deployment of "Patriot" missiles in South Korea after totally 
reversing the agreed conclusions reached between the DPRK and 
the United States in New York. 
  Facts show that the South Korean puppets are getting more 
frenzied with the passage of time in driving inter-Korean 
relations to the brink of war on the order of the U.S. masters. 
  The South Korean puppet clique are trying to ignite a war 
against the DPRK, following the adventurous war moves of the 
U.S. imperialists. But they would be well advised to mind that 
they would eventfully die a miserable death in the flame they 
kindled.

<F P=106> ["Bellicose Elements Will Have To Pay Dearly, NODONG SINMUN </F>
Commentator" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- The provokers will 
have to pay dearly, warns NODONG SINMUN today, taking a serious 
view of the new operation plan No. 5027 published by the ruling 
quarters of South Korea after establishing it with the United 
States. 
  Saying that the publication of the war scenario against the 
North cannot be overlooked, the paper in a commentator's article 
warns: 
  The South Korean ruling quarters should ponder over the 
grave 
consequences that may arise from their reckless acts of leading 
the situation to the brink of war in collusion with outside 
forces against fellow countrymen. 
  The article says: 
  The "plan" revealed recently by the puppet Defence Minister 
of South Korea, Yi Pyong-tae, provides for "five-phase military 
actions". It is a war scenario against the North which was 
worked out through a confab between ranking officers of the U.S. 
Forces and the puppet Army in September last year. 
  This is the first time that South Korea opened to the public 
an established war scenario against the North. This shows the 
Kim Yong-sam group is a cohort of bellicose elements more 
swollen-headed for northward invasion than the preceding rulers, 
and plainclothes warmaniacs more dangerous than those in 
military uniforms. 
  This is proved eloquently by the reckless military moves of 
the South Korean authorities. 
  The South Korean puppets recently held military confabs such 
as "meeting of security-related ministers" one after another 
over the "nuclear issue" of the North and "reexamined" their 
"policy toward the North" and "defence posture". On that basis, 
they decided to introduce Patriot missiles in South Korea and 
resume the Team Spirit joint military maneuvers and issued a 
"special alert order" to the entire puppet Armed Forces. These 
are ill-boding military moves to carry the war scenario against 
the North into practice. 
  As a result, a strained situation that might trigger off a 
war any moment has been created on the Korean peninsula. 
  It has been made clear that the South Korean puppets are a 
group of traitors indifferent to peace in the country and the 
fate of the nation. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group must remember that they unilaterally 
nullified the inter-Korean agreement and the joint declaration 
on denuclearisation. 
  The United States and the South Korean authorities watching 
for a chance to realise the war scenario against the North are 
wholly to blame for the tensions on the Korean peninsula. 
  The root cause of disasters must be grubbed up in time. 
  The bellicose elements such as the puppet defence minister 
trying to plunge our nation into the scourge of nuclear war must 
be punished immediately and the Kim Yong-sam traitorous regime 
be ousted. 
  With no military threat can the United States and the South 
Korean rulers frighten the Korean people. Unshakable is the 
will of our people and People's Army to punish the aggressors 
and provokers and safeguard security of the country and the 
nation. 
  We are fully prepared to deal a thousand-fold retaliatory 
blow if the South Korean rulers unleash a war against the North 
in league with outside forces. 
  The provokers will have to pay dearly.

War and Defend Peace"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee 
of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland 
issued an appeal today calling on all the compatriots in South 
Korea and overseas to join in the struggle to reject the 
resumption of the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises and the 
introduction of Patriot missiles into South Korea and check the 
dispatch of U.S. warships to the sea off South Korea and all the 
military provocations. 
  The appeal came at a time when a very grave phase of war 
fraught with an unpredictable danger has been created on the 
Korean peninsula by the reckless moves of the U.S. and South 
Korean bellicose quarters. "If a nuclear war broke out on the 
Korean peninsula, the Korean territory would be turned into a 
waste land and the Korean nation with a 5,000-year-long history 
would suffer from an irrevocable disaster", it warns, and says: 
  "True patriotism for the Korean nation is manifested in 
averting the imminent danger of war and safeguarding the 
country's peace". 
  It calls on all the political parties, groupings and people 
of all social strata of South Korea and overseas Koreans to turn 
out in a struggle for overthrowing the present treacherous 
regime of Kim Yong-sam and thwarting the reckless belligerent 
moves of the U.S. and South Korean bellicose circles. 
  It appeals to the soldiers of the "ROK" to categorically 
reject the criminal order of the war-thirsty elements who are 
forcing them to serve outside forces as their mercenaries and 
impose a nuclear war disaster upon their families and fellow 
countrymen and turn their guns to the aggressors and the 
traitors. 
  It appeals to the South Korean people to resolutely rise up 
in the anti-U.S., anti-war and anti-nuke struggle to get the 
U.S. troops and nuclear weapons out of South Korea and convert 
the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free, peace zone. 
  The appeal stresses that all the compatriots must unite with 
each other as one nation with the 10-point programme of the 
great unity of the whole nation as their common guideline of the 
nation and take part in the struggle for removing the danger of 
a nuclear war hanging over the nation and opening the way of the 
peace and peaceful reunification of the country.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
committed a grave provocation of introducing various kinds of 
military planes into South Korea from overseas bases on March 
27, according to military sources. 
  F-15 fighter bombers, FA-18 pursuit-assault planes and P-3 
anti-submarine planes from the bases in Japan and U.S. Pacific 
region were deployed in the U.S. airforce bases in South Korea 
after a long-distance flight. 
  On the same day, C-5 extra large strategic transport planes 
which load several tanks and armoured vehicles continuously flew 
in the U.S. airforce bases in South Korea from the overseas 
bases and the airlifted aggressive forces and murderous 
equipment were posted in operational zones. 
  Earlier, on March 26, C-5, C-141 and C-130 transport planes 
flew in South Korea from the U.S. overseas bases. 
  All the facts show that the U.S. imperialists' preparations 
for a war of aggression are reaching an extreme phase.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- The headquarters of 
the "All-People Movement for Defending Our Agriculture" and 
three other agriculture-related organisations in South Korea 
made public a protest statement on March 26 denouncing the 
anti-national behaviour of the Kim Yong-sam group in expanding 
the scope of the farm market opening by yielding to pressure 
from the United States, and strongly demanded a punishment of 
those responsible for it, according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  They declared that they would launch a widespread signature 
campaign against "parliamentary ratification" of the farm market 
opening. 
  The Citizens' Federation for Economic Justice on the same 
day 
published a statement condemning the Kim Yong-sam group for 
widening the scope of the farm market opening. 
  That day, Yi Ki-taek, chairman of the opposition Democratic 
Party, said they would fight in concert with broad dissident 
forces against the expansion of the scope of the farm market 
opening. 
  Meanwhile, an opinion poll conducted by the General Student 
Council of Korea University in Seoul among nearly 8,000 students 
on March 25 and 26, showed that nearly 90 percent of the 
respondents opposed the rice market opening.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- A five-day meeting of 
strategic experts of the U.S. Defence Department and the 
Japanese defence agency held in Tokyo discussed an operational 
plan for strengthening Japan-U.S. military conspiracy under the 
signboard of "Japan-U.S. security" for the "military assistance 
of the Japanese side to the U.S. side" in attacking the DPRK in 
"case of emergency" on the Korean peninsula, says the Japanese 
SANKEI SHIMBUN on March 28. 
  This is a grave military threat to the DPRK and an 
intolerable undisguised challenge to it. 
  The U.S. and Japanese military forces sit together to 
discuss 
an operational plan for controlling the DPRK by force of arms at 
the time when the situation of the Korean peninsula is rushing 
up to the brink of a war, which shows that the maneuvres of the 
U.S. imperialists to provoke a new war are entering a very grave 
stage. 
  But it is a foolish daydream that the U.S. and Japanese 
reactionaries try to control the DPRK with their military 
conspiracy. 
  They must look straight at the realities and act with 
discretion.

<F P=106> ["Heroic Stamina of Korean Young People" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- There are 5 million 
young men and women in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  Their hearts are filled with the death-defying resolution to 
dedicate their lives without hesitation to the party and the 
leader, the motherland and the people. A graphic example of 
this is the iron will and faith of the young people who rose up 
like a mountain last year to defend the nation's sovereignty and 
the country's supreme interest. 
  In March last year when a touch-and-go crisis in which a war 
might break out any moment was created due to the anti-DPRK 
campaign of the enemy, the world watched the Korean peninsula. 
  A semi-war state was declared to the whole nation, entire 
people and the whole army and a statement of the DPRK Government 
on the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) 
was published. 
  The young men and women who always accept the determination 
of the Workers' Party of Korea as their will turned out as one 
man to defend the motherland, the place for their living. 
  Young people numbering 1,500,000 volunteered to the Korean 
People's Army in a few days. 
  We do not want war but not beg for peace. [sentence as 
received] If the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets 
light the fuse of a new war indiscreetly, the five million young 
men and women will become rifles and bombs and strike an 
annihilating blow at the enemy. This was the determination of 
the Korean young people and it remains unchanged. The people 
are convinced of all victories, looking at their features. 
  In the proud chronicle of the Korean revolution that has 
advanced towards victory through a bloody road there are many 
known and unknown young heroes who devoted their lives for the 
party and the leader, the motherland and the people. 
  Kim Hyok who composed and disseminated the first 
revolutionary song of praise "Star of Korea", Kim Chin, the 
first one in the world who silenced the enemy's pillbox with his 
body in the 1930s, and Yi Su-pok, Kang Ho-yong, An Yong-ae and 
Cho Sun-ok who laid down their lives in defending the soil of 
the fatherland in the grim fatherland liberation war were all 
youths in their teens and twenties. 
  The socialist cause of Korea which was pioneered and 
faithfully inherited by the first and second generations of the 
revolution is now being unswervingly carried forward today by 
the young men and women of the third and fourth generations. 
  The young people deeply conscious of their duty for the 
times 
are registering remarkable achievements in the construction of a 
socialist independent national economy. In recent years, they 
have splendidly completed scores of large-scale construction 
projects such as the Pyongyang-Kaesong express highway, the 800 
km-long waterways on the west coast, streetcar rails in 
Pyongyang and dwelling houses for 30,000 families. 
  The construction of the world's leading West Sea barrage 
with 
three locks and 36 sluices cutting across an 8 km section of the 
wild sea, the vast construction and electrification of railways 
including the Hyesan-Manpo Youth line and the Wiyon-Motka line, 
the construction of the modern may day stadium and a number of 
public buildings in the capital were projects of monumental 
edifices undertaken by young people. 
  Korea remains unshaken in any roar of thunder because it has 
the young men and women who burn with love for the motherland 
and hatred for the enemy bent on encroaching upon the nation's 
sovereignty.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Our Party Is a Great Party With an </F>
Iron-Like Will and Tested Leadership Ability"] 
  [Text] Our glorious party is brilliantly carrying out the 
chuche revolutionary cause with iron-like will and tested 
leadership ability. The iron-like will and tested leadership 
ability of our party have been more vigorously demonstrated in 
stern struggles recently. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Recently, 
we have vigorously proven once again in the stern trials and 
struggles that our party is the great party with an iron-like 
will and tested leadership ability, that our people are the 
heroic people with a firm revolutionary faith and indomitable 
struggling spirit, and that socialism of our own style which 
embodied the chuche idea is the invincible socialism deeply 
rooted in the popular masses. The iron-like will and tested 
leadership ability are a basic criterion for the working class 
party leading the revolution. The working class party can 
overcome any trials, and victoriously lead the people, and 
consummate its historic cause to the end only if it cherishes 
the iron-like will and tested leadership ability. Therefore, it 
is very fortunate for the people to live under the leadership of 
the great party with an invincible might. 
  Today, our party has widely demonstrated its might as a 
great 
party with iron-like will and tested leadership ability by 
upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at the head. 
Above all, the iron-like will and tested leadership ability of 
our party are being clearly demonstrated in firmly leading our 
people on the socialist road, thus constantly upholding the 
revolutionary banner of the chuche idea. 
  The historic mission of the working class party lies in 
building the socialist and communist society. The will and 
leadership ability of the party can be vigorously demonstrated 
in adhering to the socialist cause and in leading it to victory. 
Furthermore, firmly adhering to the socialist cause and 
victoriously carrying it out today are emerging as important 
matters related to the destiny of mankind. 
  In recent years, socialism collapsed in some countries. With 
this, imperialists and reactionaries are babbling about 
socialism coming to an end. Also, they are more viciously 
conducting antisocialist plots. However, our party is firmly 
leading the socialist cause down the single road of chuche with 
its iron-like will and tested leadership ability that will not 
falter at any antisocialist plot. It is the invincible will of 
our party to endlessly consummate the socialist cause by 
upholding the banner of the chuche idea without the slightest 
hesitation and backwardness in any difficult situation or trial. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's works, such as 
The Historic Lesson of Socialist Construction and the 
General Line of Our Party, On the Fundamental 
Question of Revolutionary Party Building, and Abuses 
of Socialism Are Intolerable, have vigorously demonstrated 
our party's determination on how it is firm in consummating the 
socialist cause. Our party has learned lessons from the 
collapse of socialism in some countries and is vigorously moving 
forward by invoking wisdom and by showing courage of turning a 
misfortune into a blessing, thus resolutely refuting the 
reactionaries' plots against socialism. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has always made it a 
rule to solve all problems in conformity with the aspiration of 
the people and actual conditions of our country. The dear 
comrade leader has developed and consummated the chuche 
socialist idea and has enabled the popular masses to strongly 
arm themselves with it to strengthen the main force of the 
revolution. With its might, he has lead our country to be ever 
victorious. 
  Even when the socialist betrayers threw away the socialist 
principle and moved toward wholly accepting the capitalistic 
political method and economic system, we firmly adhered to the 
chuche-oriented position, thoroughly embodied the Taean work 
system, and implemented the rural theses. This clearly proves 
our party's revolutionary leadership. 
  Truly, our party's leadership is a fundamental source that 
made it possible to further consolidate and develop socialism of 
our own style. Our party's iron-like will and refined 
leadership are also manifest in leading the revolution and 
construction toward endless upsurges with far-reaching 
aspirations and ideals and without the slightest stagnation or 
stalemate. 
  The socialist cause is a long-term cause that accompanies a 
serious social change and large scale construction work. This 
cause can advance victoriously only when endless struggle is 
launched through far-reaching aspirations and ideals. We are 
leading the socialist construction toward the one road of rapid 
progress without the slightest stagnation and stalemate by 
always highly upholding the banner of continued revolution. 
Here lies the resoluteness of the working-class party's will 
and invincible leadership. 
  Our party is an experienced and ambitious revolutionary 
party 
endlessly advancing and struggling with the far-reaching 
aspiration and ideal for the bright future of socialism and 
communism. Our party's firm position is to continue revolution 
to the end until imperialism is wiped out on this land and the 
banner of socialism's victory flies high. Therefore, our party 
is firmly adhering to and vigorously pushing ahead with the 
three revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--and 
is resolutely adhering to the revolutionary principle and 
socialist principle under whatever circumstance. 
  Because of our party's wise leadership which leads socialist 
construction by unfolding an extraordinary high goal and far- 
reaching blueprint and mobilizes the popular masses' 
revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity to look ahead into the 
distant future, unprecedented miracles and innovations are being 
created in our country, and many great monumental creations that 
elucidate the era of the Workers Party are being built. 
  Our party has the strong will and militant base that does 
not 
yield to difficult situations, does not boast of victory, and 
which vigorously advances toward a new goal. Last year, on the 
occasion of the 40th anniversary of the victory of war, the 
party Central Committee announced its slogans to call the whole 
party, the whole country, and all the people, thus achieving a 
great revolutionary upsurge and brilliantly decorating the 40th 
anniversary of the victory of war as a great festival of 
victors. Also, at the 21st plenary meeting of the sixth party 
Central Committee, a revolutionary economic strategy organizing 
and mobilizing the whole party, the whole country, and all the 
people toward a new general march was presented. This is clear 
manifestation of our party's iron-like will and refined 
leadership. 
  Although our people were faced with great difficulties and 
barriers due to the unexpected international events and the 
acute situation created in the country, they consistently rose 
to create mass heroism and collective innovation without the 
slightest wavering and with revolutionary optimism and faith in 
victory, because of our party's leadership. 
  Today, our people are overflowing with confidence that when 
they move according to our party's leadership, there is nothing 
in this world that cannot be achieved and no trial or difficulty 
that cannot be resolutely overcome to occupy a high peak in 
socialism. 
  Possessed with an iron-like will and refined leadership, our 
party takes pride as a great party leading the socialist cause 
toward the one road of being ever victorious. This wholly lies 
in the fact that our party is highly upholding the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il. The dear comrade leader's iron faith and 
peerless courage comprise our party's iron-like will and his 
extraordinary ability and leadership capability comprise our 
party's refined leadership. 
  The faith and will possessed by the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il is an iron-like will which does not waver with any kind 
of thunder and lightning and which does not shake even with the 
attack of a myriad of powerful enemies. It is also a peerless 
courage that achieves victory in revolution by turning 
misfortune to good fortune and an adverse situation into a 
favorable one. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership is shown 
in 
the great decisive step of taking the initiative to overcome 
difficulties in revolution through dauntless operations; in the 
extraordinary organizational capability of achieving the final 
victory ahead of schedule by always thrusting oneself toward the 
attack line; and in the revolutionary leadership art that 
provides a new upsurge of revolutionary offensive by calling 
forth at once the whole party, all the people, and the whole 
country. 
  Because the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's wise 
leadership encompasses wisdom of keen insight, peerless courage, 
and refined leadership, our party is highly manifesting to the 
whole world, the dignity of a militant party which possesses 
invincible, ever-victorious leadership, and our party is highly 
manifesting to the whole world the dignity of a heroic people 
possessed with revolutionary faith. 
  Our people will adhere to the socialist banner according to 
the leadership of the great party and leader [suryong] to the 
end, and will brilliantly build socialism of our own style 
centered on the popular masses.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- Cement output is 
moving upward in Korea. 
  According to data available at the Ministry of Building 
Materials Industry, it showed a 20 percent gain in the first two 
months or more of this year as against the same period last 
year. The output in 20 odd days of March was 10,000 tons more 
than in the comparable period of the previous month. 
  The cement industry of Korea has a great potential. There 
are in the country hundreds of large and minor cement 
factories, among them the 3 million ton-capacity Sunchon cement 
complex and the 2 million ton-capacity Sangwon cement complex. 
Inexhaustible deposits of raw materials and fuel for cement are 
found in all parts of the country. There are more than one 
hundred of seams of limestone, the basic raw material of cement, 
and coal deposits run into tens of billions of tons. 
  The independent and modern cement industry which is 
developing in reliance upon rich domestic raw materials and fuel 
firmly guarantees the economic construction of the country. 
This is graphically illustrated by the construction of vast 
scale during the Third Seven-Year Plan period (1987-1993). In 
that period the construction of major projects including power 
bases, metal industrial bases and chemical industrial bases was 
pushed forward bringing more than 11,000 projects to completion 
in the industrial sector alone. 
  The monument to the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War, 
the 
Three-Revolution Exhibition, the Mangyongdae School Children's 
Palace, the May Day Stadium, gymnasiums in Chongchun Street and 
many other monumental edifices were built in the capital city of 
Pyongyang and upwards of 3,200 educational, cultural and health 
care institutions, various welfare service facilities and 
residential houses for over 1 million families were constructed 
throughout the country. 
  The state satisfactorily met the demand for cement in this 
vast construction with domestic products, and exported a large 
quantity of it. 
  The renowned Korean cement of "Kumgang" brand was awarded 
twice the gold medal on the international market.

  [Text] Jakarta -- Indonesian and Australian trade 
ministers have discussed ways of improving bilateral trade and 
keep in equilibrium bilateral trade balance which has since 1986 
posted a deficit to Indonesia. 
  "We have discussed ways of improving bilateral economic 
ties, 
particularly trade and investments," Australia's trade minister, 
Bob McMullan, told the press after a meeting with his Indonesian 
counterpart, S.B. Yudono, here Monday. 
  The two ministers also talked about matters related to the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. 
  The two-way trade between the two countries in the 
January-November 1993 period reached 1.96 billion U.S. dollars, 
up by 3.15 percent over the figure in the same period in 1992, 
but Indonesia sustained a deficit of 513.5 million U.S. dollars. 
  In 1982, Indonesia sustained a deficit of 254.9 million U.S. 
dollars from its trade with Australia, and the figure swelled to 
666.8 million U.S. dollars a decade later. 
  In the meantime, Indonesia's exports registered at 158.6 
million U.S. dollars in 1982 rose to 746.125 million U.S. 
dollars a decade later. 
  On the occasion, the Australian trade minister invited 
Indonesian businessmen to invest in Australia and pledged that 
Australian entrepreneurs will do likewise in Indonesia. 
  In an effort to boost trade relations, Indonesia has offered 
40 percent tariff binding for 8,877 post headings consisting of 
7,536 post headings for industrial products and 1,341 post 
headings for agricultural products.

from the tariff binding on the grounds of security, general 
exception, or being still needed for national economic 
development. 
  The products whose exception has been requested comprise 
inter alia iron and steel products and motorized vehicles and 
their components. 
  Regarding rice, Indonesia is willing to give market access 
to 
70,000 tons of rice annually, a quantity equal to 50 percent of 
import average in 1986-88. 
  Indonesia has also offered market access to trade in 
services 
involving five sectors -- tourism, sea transportation, finance, 
industry/construction, and telecommunications. 
  The two sides have also agreed to set up working groups on 
trade, industry, investment, agriculture, and food to improve

  [Text] The visit by Portuguese citizens of East Timorese 
origin to their native land is a blow to Ramos Horta, leader of 
Fretilin [Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor], a 
terrorist group in East Timor. Ramos Horta, who is living 
abroad, has been trying to tarnish Indonesia's image through 
various ways in the world community. Nugroho Wisnumurti, 
Indonesian permanent representative to the United Nations, told 
reporters in Dili that Ramos Horta, who is opposed to the 
integration of East Timor into Indonesia, should reckon with the 
visit by the Portuguese citizens of East Timorese origin to 
Dili, which is a step forward toward an Indonesian-Portuguese 
reconciliation. According to Ambassador Nugroho Wisnumurti, the 
international community has adopted a very different view on 
East Timor since talks between the Indonesian and Portuguese 
foreign ministers on 17 September 1993 and the informal London 
talks sometime ago. The visit of Ambassador Nugroho Wisnumurti 
who was accompanied by Indonesian Ambassador to Australia Sabam 
Siagian was, among other things, intended to provide input to 
trilateral talks involving the Indonesian and Portuguese foreign 
ministers and the United Nations to be held on 6 May.

<F P=106> [Report by station Correspondent Dao Nguyen: "The Door to </F>
Cooperation Between Vietnam and Malaysia Is Wide Open"] 
  [Summary] Malaysia is considered to be one of the economic 
dragons in Asia. To this end, Malaysia has exerted efforts to 
make its presence felt. The principle of opening one's door to 
the outside world without losing one's own traits is strictly 
applied to everyday activities in Malaysia. The country 
consists of people of different races with Malaysians accounting 
for 53 percent of the population and Chinese, Indians, and other 
foreign nationals representing the rest of the population. 
Although Malaysians belong to different religions, they all get 
along very well. 
  Malaysians regard Vietnam as a true friend. Therefore, on 
the very first day of their visit, General Secretary Do Muoi and 
other Vietnamese guests were invited to attend the 10th General 
Meeting of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council. 
  Reporting on this event, major newspapers in Malaysia 
carried 
headlines saying that this was a unique dialogue. At that 
meeting, General Secretary Do Muoi answered many questions 
raised by the delegates. In response to a question posed by a 
famous British film producer as to whether Vietnam, while 
implementing its open-door policy, is worried about the 
influence of foreign cultures on its national traits, General 
Secretary Do Muoi emphatically said: We welcome mankind's 
cultural quintessence and cultural activities that help promote 
friendship, enrich the sense of aesthetics, and perfect the good 
personality of the Vietnamese people. 
  Before leaving Malaysia, General Secretary Do Muoi granted 
an 
interview to correspondents of the Voice of Vietnam and the 
Vietnam Television Network on the results of his visit to 
Malaysia. He said: 
  [Begin Do Muoi recording] It can be said that my visit has 
yielded very encouraging results. Our Malaysian friends have 
accorded the Vietnamese delegation a very warm welcome. We 
witnessed many building projects everywhere we went. I am 
convinced that by the year 2020, Malaysia will achieve its 
economic objectives of turning itself into a developed 
industrialized country. Our Malaysian friends highly value the 
renovation process in Vietnam and hope that our country will 
reach a relatively quick growth rate within a short period of 
time. His Excellency Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed and I are 
pleased to note that so far, the friendship and cooperation 
between the two countries have developed very well. Both of us 
hope that together with the recent visits by Vietnamese Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir 
Mohamed, my current visit will contribute to consolidating and 
strengthening bilateral cooperative ties a step further. His 
Excellency Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed said: It is 
necessary for Vietnam to move forward, effect changes for the 
better, and enrich itself, thereby helping create conditions for 
Malaysia and other neighboring countries to score better 
development results. [end recording]

<F P=106> [NHAN DAN 28 March editorial: "For Prosperity in Vietnam, </F>
Malaysia, and the Region"] 
  [Text] The first official visit to Malaysia by Comrade 
General Secretary Do Muoi has concluded successfully. This 
important event in SRV-Malaysia neighborly ties attracted good 
attention in the region and the world. 
  This successful visit not only further strengthens 
SRV-Malaysia friendship and cooperation but will also contribute 
to futhering the aspirations of the people of Southeast Asia for 
peace, stability, development, and prosperity. During his stay 
in Malaysia, our general secretary was solemnly and warmly 
received by the highest government leaders, the ruling National 
Front, the United Malays National Organization, and the 
Malaysian people. 
  Talks between General Secretary Do Muoi with Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamed on ties and issues of mutual concern were held 
in an atmosphere of sincerity and friendship. Comrade General 
Secretary Do Muoi highly evaluated Malaysia's great national 
development achievements, which have been rapid and stable, and 
its increasing world reputation. He thanked the Malaysian 
Government for its sincerity in sharing its precious experience 
in national development and management. He aslo welcomed 
Malaysia efforts in strengthening and expediting relations with 
Vietnam. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed expressed his 
admiration at Vietnam's economic development and belief that 
Vietnam will develop and prosper like other nations in Southeast 
Asia. 
  General Secretary Do Muoi's visit has enhanced the mutual 
understanding and trust between the leaders and peoples of the 
two countries. Vietnam's important achievements in the 
renovation and its open-door foreign policy to diversify and 
multiply party and state ties, together with the Malaysian 
Government's policy of improving relations with Vietnam are very 
important elements for both countries in developing their 
potential and accelerating friendship and cooperation for their 
peoples. 
  Among new developments in Southeast Asia and in the Asia 
Pacific, Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi's visit is a new and 
vivid manifestation of Vietnam's policy of wanting to befriend 
all nations to strive for peace, independence, and development. 
Vietnam has joined the Bali Agreement, become an ASEAN 
observer, and participated in some ASEAN activities in 
preparation of its joining ASEAN at an appropriate time. 
  Persisting on the four-point policy announced by General 
Secretary Do Muoi in Bangkok in his October 1993 Thailand visit, 
Vietnam supports initiatives for increased cooperation. This 
includes Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed's initiative on the 
East-Asia Economic Caucus. Vietnam is also ready for joint 
cooperative institutions in the Asia Pacific such as the Pacific 
Economic Cooperation Council [PECC], the Pacific Basin Economic 
Council, and so forth. 
  At the 10th PECC General Meeting in Kuala Lumpur on 25 
March, 
our general secretary emphasized Vietnam's consistent policy in 
maintaining good ties with nations in the Pacific. Vietnam 
places on priority the duty of broadening cooperation with 
nations in the Pacific and the development of ties with all 
nations in the world for the acceleration of better and broader 
friendship and cooperation with neighboring countries in 
Southeast Asia. At the same, it advocates negotiations to 
settle all things left over by history or newly arising 
problems. We ensure that all nations in the Asia Pacific will 
find in Vietnam a positive counterpart and a reliable customer. 
  Our open-door foreign policy, independence, and sovereignty 
has been welcomed by friends. Malaysia highly evaluates the 
positive developments in bilateral ties. The SRV-ASEAN ties has 
opened many potential areas for long-term cooperation. It also 
emphasizes the need for a common voice on issues of mutual 
concern. 
  Our people welcomes the success of General Secretary Do 
Muoi's visit to Malaysia. We are happy at the new developments 
in SRV-Malaysian friendship and cooperation, which meet the 
aspiration and benefit of the peoples both countries for peace, 
cooperation, development, and prosperity in the entire region.

<F P=106> [From the "Talk of the Week" feature] </F>
  [Text] Dear listeners: In our program Talk of the Week 
last Friday, we told you about the character of Nguyen Xuan Chu, 
who is now in the Van Hanh Monastery in Australia. This time we 
would like to talk about his sabotage activities while he was in 
Vietnam as well as what he is doing now in a foreign country, 
and the real objectives of these activities. 
  When he was in Vietnam, Nguyen Xuan Chu told the police of 
the former southern province of Nghia Binh during an 
interrogation: I was born and grew up under the U.S. puppet 
regime, the political system full of dark [word indistinct]. As 
a result, I was influenced by the U.S. puppet's [word 
indistinct] allegations against the revolution. After the 
liberation of southern Vietnam in 1975, a number of people in 
the name of the leaders of the United Vietnam Buddhist Church; 
the An Quang faction; and a number of bad friends, including 
Huyen Quang in the Dharma Institute, who had hostile ideas and 
activities against the revolution, directly incited and guided 
me to act against the state and people. Huyen Quang, at his own 
free will, made use of his position at the time of the 
liberation, to initiate a policy with political undertones, not 
corresponding to the nature of a traditional appeal [words 
indistinct]. He compiled a document entitled: BUDDHISM IN THE 
NEW SITUATION, in which he advocated non-cooperation with the 
revolutionary administration. Huyen Quang made use of his 
prestige to cheat people and abuse the trust and enthusiasm of 
Buddhist followers as well as the obedience of the local 
Buddhist churches and followers to stir up hostile activities, 
pushing them onto a sinful road against the administration. I am 
one of these victims. 
  However, since he arrived in Australia, particularly over 
the 
last few years, Nguyen Xuan Chu has acted against the Vietnamese 
people's revolutionary cause and the national renovation 
process. He has incited some MPs to use their influence on their 
government as well as on the governments of other countries to 
maintain the embargo against Vietnam and restrict their 
cooperative relations with Vietnam. 
  He collected signatures of Vietnamese Buddhist followers and 
residents of Australia for a letter sent to the Australian 
Parliament, supporting hostile and opposition activities. He 
has coordinated with Vo Dai Ton,and reactionary groups in 
carrying out sabotage activities against Vietnam. Together with 
the group of Vo Van Ai, and Thich (Vien) Ly, he organized 
meetings, demonstrations, and hunger strikes and made use of the 
mass media to slander Buddhist affairs. 
  It was reported by many people in Australia that Nguyen Xuan 
Chu is specializing in trading goods and furniture for Buddhist 
monks, nuns, and followers. He has been made bankrupt, and 
there are possibilities that his property will be confiscated by 
the Australian Court. Therefore, Nguyen Xuan Chu is trying to 
smear and slander the situation of Buddhism in Vietnam to raise 
funds among Vietnamese residents abroad, including reactionary 
organizations in exile, for the so called support for the 
struggle of Buddhists at home. 
  But in fact he has put all the money in his own pocket. 
These activities of Nguyen Xuan Chu have been protested against 
by Buddhists in Australia, and exposed by the press there. 
However, the matter remains unknown to many Buddhists in 
Vietnam and many Vietnamese residents in France, Canada, and the 
United States. Nguyen Xuan Chu is one of those people who, for 
their own interests, are ready to carry out any activities, 
including those against their own nation, people, and friends.

  [Text] The paper CONG GIAO VA DAN TOC (CATHOLICISM AND 
NATION) publishes in issue No. 947 an interview with Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet by its editor in chief, Catholic priest 
Truong Ba Can, on a number of issues related to the Roman 
Catholic Church in Vietnam. 
  SAIGON GIAI PHONG has the honor of presenting this interview 
to our readers. 
  [Truong Ba Can] Dear Prime Minister, does the religious 
issue 
ever pose any concern to you at all? 
  [Vo Van Kiet] As far as religion is concerned, the recent 
incidents in Hue and Ho Chi Minh City have caused me great 
concern. 
  I would like to point out here that our country was 
dominated 
and suffered from the consequences of war for quite a long time. 
Since regaining national independence and unification, we have 
set a clear direction for advancement and scored initial 
achievements in the renovation process. Although there are more 
issues to be discussed and developed, we must strive to maintain 
stability in our country, especially the politico-social 
stability so as to develop our economy more rapidly. This is a 
very important experience we have had in the past period. 
  [Truong Ba Can] What is your assessment of the Ho Chi Minh 
City Catholic community's role in maintaining stability? 
  [Vo Van Kiet] I have always highly appraised the patriotic 
spirit of Vietnamese Catholics in Ho Chi Minh City. I still 
remember, during the most difficult period when fighting erupted 
at the southwestern border and the city experienced food 
shortages, that the people had to eat sorghum and sweet potato. 
Yet, Vietnamese Catholics and people in the city, together with 
Catholic priests, participated in building water conservation 
projects and setting up defense lines. Even Archbishop Nguyen 
Van Binh went to the Thai My state farm to take the lead in 
building water conservation projects, and to Hoc Mon District to 
attend a ceremony launching construction of a border defense 
line. Both the archbishop and I had very small roles in this 
work, but the presence of the archbishop greatly encouraged 
Vietnamese Catholics there to work selflessly to overcome the 
difficulties and stabilize their daily lives, thereby sharing 
the hardships with the other people in the city. Perhaps it is 
for this reason that despite the confusion in the Vatican's 
recent unilateral appointment of an apostolic administrator 
[giams quanr toongr toaf] in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnamese 
Catholics have firmly maintained their daily lives, carried out 
their normal activities, and participated actively in various 
socioeconomic development programs while organizing a solemn, 
beautiful, and orderly Christmas celebration. 
  I should say that Vietnamese Catholics in the city realized 
quickly that the Ho Chi Minh City administration's reaction to 
this case was aimed at protecting national sovereignty, abiding 
by the state law, and maintaining stability for the daily lives 
of the people. Thanks to this awareness, the city's Committee 
for Solidarity among Vietnamese Catholics successfully organized 
its third congress recently with the participation of all 
Catholic priests and adherents as in the past. 
  [Truong Ba Can] Dear Prime Minister, the appointments of 
bishops and apostolic administrators are normally discussed with 
and jointly approved by the Vatican and the State of Vietnam. 
What is your opinion on the recent Vatican appointment? 
  [Vo Van Kiet] According to international practice, many 
countries contend that the appointment of bishops should be done 
in consultation with and with the approval of the governments of 
the nations concerned. In the latest agreement between the 
Vatican and Poland, this point was stipulated. Vietnam has no 
such agreement with the Vatican because we have no official 
diplomatic relations with the Holy See. We have, however, 
reached consensus with the Vatican that the appointments of 
cardinals, bishops, and apostolic administrators should be 
discussed with and approved by our government in advance. There 
were, however, abnormal cases, such as a number of bishops who 
have been approved jointly by the government and the Vatican, 
but official appointments from the Holy See have not been made. 
It is regrettable that the Vatican recently appointed an 
apostolic administrator for the Ho Chi Minh City diocese without 
consultation with the Vietnamese Government. I think that the 
Vatican should consider this issue carefully. 
  [Truong Ba Can] But Catholic bishops are dutybound to take 
orders from the Vatican. 
  [Vo Van Kiet] I understand this point. We must not forget, 
however, that these bishops are also Vietnamese citizens, and as 
such they must abide by the state law as do other Vietnamese 
citizens. Moreover, I think that, in some cases, the Vatican 
has not firmly grasped the actual situation in Vietnam. 
  If provided with adequate and accurate information, the 
Vatican would have arrived at the appropriate decisions. It is 
firmly believed that Vatican does not want to create tension and 
drive the local Catholic Church onto an unlawful path. We are 
aware that since the Vietnamese Government's refusal to accept 
the appointment of the aspotolic administrator of Ho Chi Minh 
City Diocese, the Vatican has not made its official attitude 
known, pending arrival of its delegation in Vietnam. 
  [Truong Ba Can] As far as we know, the appointment of 
bishops is totally under Vatican jurisdiction. Prior to an 
appointment, however, according to normal diplomatic practice, 
the Vatican must consult with the government of the relevant 
country over this. For its part, the relevant government may or 
may not accept this appointment, depending on its political 
considerations. You are therefore kindly requested to speak of 
the conditions and standards for acceptance. 
  [Vo Van Kiet] As for the issue of appointing bishops in 
Vietnam, I would like to clarify the following points: 
  1. At present, certain dioceses still have some bishopric 
slots left unfilled. I would like to point out here that this 
has nothing to do with the Vietnamese Government. This is 
because the Vietnamese Government has, only in certain cases, 
refused to accept such appointments, leaving the Vatican with 
many options. 
  2. As for Ho Chi Minh City, over the past 18 years, thanks 
to the presence of Elder Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh as the head 
of the church, the Catholic compatriots have been experiencing 
positive change and growth. Therefore, when the issue of a 
successor to Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh was raised, the 
Vietnamese Government made it clear that the new archbishop must 
be the one who will carry on along those beautiful lines. 
  I believe that every government must have measures to 
protect 
its national sovereignty and maintain public order and security 
in order to guarantee a peaceful and happy life for its people. 
If the Vatican respects Vietnamese sovereignty and is interested 
in bringing about a stable life for its faithful, it would not 
be difficult for it to reach a consensus with our government. 
  I have the feeling that the Vatican has, in certain cases, 
not been well-informed of the situation in Vietnam. 
  [Truong Ba Can] Could you, the prime minister, cite some 
specific cases? 
  [Vo Van Kiet] The issue of Catholic fathers and clergymen 
participating in people's elected organs or in Vietnam Catholics 
Unity [VCU] committees was a case in point. 
  In 1982, there was a circular from Rome advising Catholic 
fathers and clergymen not to stand for National Assembly or 
people's council elections. It also prohibited them from setting 
up or participating in any associations, as this may cause 
division in the church. Elder Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh and 
some other bishops convinced the Vatican that in Vietnam joining 
the National Assembly or people's councils is just for the 
purpose of performing one own's duty as a citizen and not for 
engaging in a power struggle as in other countries. VCU 
committees are only popular political organizations designed to 
promote patriotism among Catholic compatriots. The Vatican 
seems to have been aware of this fact and most of the Vietnamese 
bishops have let their subordinate Catholic priests and other 
clergymen join Fatherland Front committees, elected organs, and 
VCU committees. Nevertheless, I was advised in 1992 that due to 
unknown reasons, the Vatican issued another circular, urging 
Vietnamese bishops to prohibit their priests and other clergymen 
from joining elected organs or VCU committees. 
  It took 10 years, from 1982-92, for Catholic bishops, 
fathers, and clergymen and all other Catholic compatriots in 
Vietnam to have become clearly aware that far from doing any 
harm to Catholicism, those Catholic clergymen serving elected 
organs or VCU committees have done good services to the region 
and the country. Fully aware of this fact, why is it that 
certain bishops have continued to cite the Vatican order as an 
excuse to prohibit their subordinate clergy from joining elected 
organs or VCU committees? 
  I think that by taking part in national construction 
activities, Catholic compatriots are exercising their rights and 
duties as citizens. 
  [Truong Ba Can] This issue has been raised partly because 
the religious policy has failed to appease people's worries 
about various issues such as the seminarian issue, the 
operations and education of various religious orders, the repair 
and construction of churches, and so forth. 
  [Vo Van Kiet] The reason why our government continues to 
remain strict in certain areas is that we want to ensure 
stability for social and religious activities. If everyone is 
aware of this, the resolution of various matters would become 
easier. Therefore, we must give specific consideration to each 
particular issue. We must listen to public opinion and join 
hands in resolving it. All for common stability. 
  [Truong Ba Can] You, the prime minister, just stated that 
the lines to be followed are the ones advocated and practiced by 
Arbishop Nguyen Van Binh in Ho Chi Minh City over the past 18 
years. What did you have in your mind when saying so? 
  [Vo Van Kiet] I was thinking of those lines brought up by 
various bishops in a joint letter dated 1 May 1980 which 
advocates "leading a Gospel-directed life in the bounds of the 
nation in order to serve the happiness of the compatriots." 
This means that while caring about the religion, one must also 
concern oneself with secular affairs. More precisely, religion 
is designed to care for the people. Leading a Gospel-directed 
life means serving the happiness of compatriots in general, not 
just Catholic compatriots. This also involves the attitude to 
be adopted in everyday life. We must support our nation, 
respect our national interests, national sovereignty and state 
law, understand difficulties facing it, and put ourselves in the 
same difficult situation of the country whenever we discuss 
national issues, including those related to church and state. 
  It is regrettable that all Vietnamese bishops have only 
deployed and applied these lines within their own dioceses. 
  On the contrary, in Ho Chi Minh City, Elder Archbishop 
Nguyen 
Van Binh has constantly adhered to these lines since the 
liberation of the south. As a high-ranking clergyman, he has 
been caring and working for his religion and has, at the same 
time, never allowed himself to forget his duty toward the 
nation, as he has always cared for the national interest. 
  I have the feeling that the Catholic Church has yet to fully 
appreciate the meritorious deeds of Elder Archbishop Nguyen Van 
Binh or treat him fairly. As a man who has dedicated his whole 
life to a cause, he has only one desire, that is to see what he 
has done continue to be carried out. All of us must show 
responsibility in this matter. 
  [Truong Ba Can] In 1994, the Ho Chi Minh City Catholic 
Diocese will celebrate its 150th anniversary. This is an 
opportunity for us to review our past in preparation for the 
future. 
  [Vo Van Kiet] Yes, history has left us a very damaging 
legacy, namely the prejudices between Catholics and 
non-Catholics and between Catholicism and communism. 
  Today, this situation has changed greatly, though not 
completely. If there are any points in the relationship that we 
do not correctly understand, we must continue to resolve them. 
The reason why there have been changes for the better in Ho Chi 
Minh City is that we have practiced the policy on religious 
freedom and satisfactorily achieved the goal of ensuring the 
benefits of both the region and the people. It must be admitted 
that the contributions made by Elder Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh, 
the Catholics Motivation Committee, the Catholic Unity 
Committee, and the journal CONG GIAO VA DAN TAN [CATHOLICS AND 
THE NATION] are very important. Therefore, we must try to ensure 
that the heir to the archbishopric of Ho Chi Minh City will not 
follow a policy which run counters to that of Elder Archbishop 
Nguyen Van Binh and that the Catholic Unity Committee and the 
journal CONG GIAO VA DAN TOC can play bigger roles in helping 
the Catholic community achieve progress together with the rest 
of the nation. 
  Some people often complain about having difficulty seeking 
permission to build churches. But everywhere I went, I saw many 
newly built churches, including many large ones whose 
construction cost billions of dong. Our Catholic compatriots, 
of course, need comfortable and fine-looking places to meet and 
worship. But in some localities, there have been expensive 
churches built in the middle of slum areas. This must be 
reviewed, taking into account the need to increasingly improve 
the material and cultural life of the working Catholic people. 
  Although I still have many things to talk about, please 
allow 
me to stop here. Through the journal CONG GIAO VA DAN TOC, I 
wish the readership and the city's Catholic compatriots good 
health and happiness. As Vietnamese, irrespective of one is 
Catholic or not, we share the same motherland. Formerly, people 
thought of setting out in search of a new life in one area or 
another. But now it has become evident that there is no area 
for us to live in other than our own motherland. Therefore, we 
must join hands in a bid to build a prosperous country for the 
benefit of both the people and the region. 
  [Truong Ba Can] On behalf of the CONG GIAO VA DAN TOC 
readership and the Catholic compatriots in the city, I wish you, 
the prime minister, good health so you can continue to lead the 
country forward.

  [Text] HANOI, March 25 (AFP) -- Foreigners have stolen at 
least 60 confidential files from Vietnamese army archives, the 
head of the military security protection department Colonel Cao 
Long Hy said in a report here Friday. 
  The documents, including secret "internal documents," give 
details of the history and activities of several branches of the 
army dating back to their creation, said Hy in an article 
published in the army's daily newspaper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN. The 
papers have been taken out of the country by "foreigners" since 
the beginning of 1993, he said without identifying the culprits. 
  Observers say this is the first time that such a 
high-ranking 
army official has talked publicly of documents being leaked from 
military archives and taken abroad. The colonel said bad 
management of the print-works and archives, as well as 
negligence and the breaking of rules on the protection of 
military secrets, had contributed to the disappearance of 
certain files. 
  He said other documents had also vanished but acknowledged 
that the reason for their disappearance was not known. 
  Observers say the files could have been stolen by army 
employees to be sold later outside the country. 
  Colonel Hy said the documents had been "deformed, modified 
and re-written" before being published by "hostile foreign 
media" organisations, in order to "criticise the `doi moi' 
(renovation) policy, to caricature the army's role and to 
sabotage Vietnam's relations with other countries in the region." 
  He called on the army to protect internal secrets and 
redouble its vigilance "in the face of sophisticated enemy 
manoeuvres and the bad elements of society." 
  The colonel added that "the enemy takes advantage of 
diplomatic, economic, humanitarian and tourism activities, to 
examine Vietnam's... politics, economy, defence and security in 
order to commit sabotage by establishing contact with 
reactionary groups based inside the country". 
  He said the issue of the protection of state and army 
secrets 
was a "task which has now become imperative," referring to a 
1992 directive on the subject by Vietnam's defence minister. 
  Conservative elements in Vietnam, especially military 
officials, have publicly expressed concern that economic and 
political pressure from the West since the lifting of the US 
trade embargo last month will destabilize the country.

  [Text] The Central Market Management Steering Committee 
held a conference recently to discuss measures to strengthen 
coordination to fight smuggling on various sea routes between 
provinces in the northeastern region which include Quang Ninh, 
Haiphong, Thai Binh, and Nam Ha. Goods smuggling along various 
sea routes in Vietnam is on the increase, especially in offshore 
areas. Many high-powered vessels of economic establishments and 
ships of the armed forces have engaged in transporting smuggled 
goods. The conference called for efforts to seriously suppress 
smuggling along these sea routes and to ensure collection of 
full taxes levied on foreign goods at the border areas.

<F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Papua New Guinea [PNG] Army has sent 
reinforcements onto the main island of Bougainville where 17 
people were massacred in a rebel ambush on Wednesday [23 March]. 
Among those killed was a six-year-old girl. Richard Pilferman 
earlier today spoke to PNG correspondent Sean Dorney, who is in 
Madang with the business delegation: 
  [Begin recording] [Pilferman] According to reports that have 
come out of Buin in southern Bougainville, there were two 
truckloads of people with military escorts and the resistance 
fighter escorts heading down from the Tabago Care Center, which 
is basically a refugee camp, to the coast to pick up food 
supplies, and they were ambushed as they passed through a 
village on the road. According to these reports, they were fired 
on from all sides and most of the dead -- there are 13 people 
who've been fighting against the BRA [Bougainville Revolutionary 
Army] -- 12 of those members of the resistance forces and one 
Papua New Guinea soldier. Now the media can't get into 
Bougainville, knowing the danger of traveling the country with 
the Queensland investment delegation, and I believe that last 
night the Papua New Guinea police minister told the delegates 
the Bougainville crisis was all but over. It would appear that 
that's not quite true. 
  [Dorney] The government has been trying to believe that it 
is all but over and that's what they've been telling everyone 
for the last few months. In fact, Mr. Wingti on his trip to 
Australia gave a similar story to Bob Hawke. Six months ago, 
the government did have the Bougainville rebels pretty well 
contained in a central Bougainville area in the mountains there. 
But the pressure's been let off and in recent weeks we've seen 
a real upsurge in rebel activity on our part of the mainland, in 
fact, the main road down the east coast now is not safe from 
Buka right through to (Lomahi,) which is where military 
headquarters are. For the situation has tumbled well out of 
control in recent weeks, and the government is going to have to 
take it very seriously now because there is trouble blowing up 
in areas that previously were considered quite safe. [passage

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- Following is a summary of a 
package of market-opening measures approved by the cabinet 
Tuesday [29 March]. 
<H5>  Basic Policy </H5>
  The measures are to help achieve over the medium term a 
highly significant decrease in Japan's current account surplus 
and significant increases in imports of competitive foreign 
products and services. 
<H5>  Macroeconomic Measures </H5>
  -- The government will actively promote over the medium term 
strong and sustainable demand-led economic growth to cut the 
current account surplus significantly. Fiscal, financial and 
other measures will be reconsidered as needed. 
  -- The government officially forecasts the surplus will fall 
to about 13.8 trillion yen, or 2.8 percent of gross domestic 
product (GDP) in fiscal 1994 starting Friday from 14.4 trillion 
yen, or 3.1 percent of GDP, in fiscal 1993. 
  -- The government will review by around June its 430 
trillion 
yen public works spending program for the current decade, 
including reconsideration of the allocation and an increase of 
funds. 
  -- Tax reform, including permanent personal income tax cuts, 
is intended by year's end. The bill with this year's tax cuts 
has been amended in the Diet, and the government will promptly 
implement tax reform including the permanent and structural 
individual income tax reduction. 
<H5>  Deregulation </H5>
  -- The government will compile by the end of June a 
fast-track package of priority items, noting foreign opinions 
and focusing on improving market access, ensuring 
internationally compatible standards and approval systems, and 
simplifying and speeding up procedures. It will cover real 
estate and land, information and telecommunications, 
distribution, licensing and inspection standards and financial 
services. 
  -- A comprehensive five-year deregulation program will be 
completed in fiscal 1994. 
  -- The government will seek quick approval of a bill now in 
the Diet to set up an independent body to monitor deregulation 
and make recommendations, which the prime minister shall respect. 
<H5>  Competition </H5>
  -- Investigative staff at the Fair Trade Commission will be 
increased by 9 percent with further increases in the future. 
  -- Foreign opinions will be sought, and their adoption 
intended for the summer, on bid-tender guidelines to prevent 
"dango" bid-rigging. 
  -- Guidelines on trade association activities and 
regulations 
on premiums will be reviewed. 
<H5>  Import and Investment Promotion </H5>
  -- The government will implement fiscal 1994 measures 
enhancing the tax system and public financing to promote imports 
and will expand foreign access zones, import cargo facilities 
and customs systems and the business support center. 
  -- Tax incentives for direct investment and loan programs by 
the Japan Development Bank will be expanded, and the Office of 
the Trade and Investment Ombudsman and the Trade Council will be 
actively used. 
<H5>  Government Procurement </H5>
  -- The government will increase openness, fairness and 
competition before procurement procedures begin, to help 
competitive domestic and foreign suppliers enter and to change 
the mind-set of those involved with the procedures. 
  -- Operational guidelines will be adopted going beyond those 
specified by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
Information will be made available before tender and comments 
will be requested. 
<H5>  Voluntary Steps in Japan-U.S. "Priority Areas" </H5>
  -- Procedures will be improved in government procurement of 
telecommunications and medical technology to facilitate the 
entry of competitive foreign products and significantly increase 
their sales, including nondiscriminatory access to information. 
  -- Insurance deregulation will proceed, clarifying and 
making 
more flexible approval procedures for product development and 
premiums. A broker system will be introduced. Licensing and 
approval standards will be clarified. 
  -- The government will facilitate, within its scope and 
responsibility, increased imports of autos and auto parts and 
purchases of local parts by Japanese plants overseas. It will 
financially support import car exhibitions and design-in 
promotions, with cooperation from the Export-Import Bank of 
Japan and the Japan Development Bank. A permanent Transport 
Ministry technical office will be stationed in Detroit to 
promote type-designation approvals.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- A projection of current 
account surplus included in Japan's trade package is not a 
numerical target, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Tuesday 
[29 March]. "It is not a numerical target, and I believe 
foreign nations will recognize this," Fujii told reporters at 
the Diet after emerging from a morning cabinet meeting. 
  Japan unveiled earlier the package of market-opening and 
fiscal measures designed to seek a breakthrough in the stalled 
trade talks with the United States. 
  Although it offers neither specific targets in reducing 
trade 
surplus nor measuring market access, the package spells out that 
an official government economic forecast indicates the ratio of 
current account surplus to gross domestic product (GDP) will 
fall from 3.4 percent in fiscal 1992 to 3.1 percent in fiscal 
1993 that ends on Thursday and to 2.8 percent in coming fiscal 
1994. 
  Fujii indicated his opposition in using construction bonds 
to 
finance an increase suggested in the package for the 
government's public works spending plan from fiscal 1991 through 
2001. Construction bonds are "debt and leave principal and 
interest payments to future generations," Fujii stressed. 
  But he declined to comment on tax hikes that are apparently 
the only alternative. 
  In the trade program, Japan reconfirms that it will decide 
by 
the end of June a proposed boosting of the public works spending 
plan on a condition that financing is secured to avoid leaving 
burdens to future generations. 
  On tax cuts, Fujii said the trade package reaffirmed as he 
has been stressing that the ruling coalition parties are slated 
to decide in June on a full-fledged tax reform, including a 
continuation of income tax cuts that are limited to a 
single-year scheme for fiscal 1994. He noted that the package 
shows Japan's further commitment by stating that the Diet's 
House of Representatives attached a provision for permanent 
income tax cuts in the single-year bills passed last week. 
  The bills are now under deliberation at the House of 
Councillors. 
  U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and other officials 
have said that Japan's single-year tax cuts are insufficient to 
boost domestic demand and curb trade surplus, and have also 
called for further fiscal measures. 
  Fujii would not make any predictions over the U.S. reaction 
on the trade measures Japan has vowed to compile by the end of 
March. 
  With the package launched in time, Japan now awaits U.S. 
judgment as officials have repeated that the U.S. would assess 
the possibility of resuming the stalled framework talks after 
reviewing the March measures.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- The government's inclusion 
in a set of market-opening steps of an expected fall in Japan's 
current account surplus does not amount to a promise, the 
nation's economic planning chief said Tuesday [29 March]. 
  The forecast that the surplus will fall to 2.8 percent of 
gross domestic product (GDP) in fiscal 1994 starting Friday 
cannot "so directly become a promise or target," Manae Kubota, 
Director General of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA), told a 
regular news conference after a morning cabinet meeting. But 
the government will "make efforts" to realize the 2.8 percent 
figure, which was previously released as the official forecast, 
she said. 
  Kubota noted that the current account surplus, expected to 
come to 3.1 percent of GDP this fiscal year, is affected by such 
international factors as currency exchange rates. 
  The surplus forecast, as well as plans to review the 
government's 430 trillion public works spending program for the 
decade through 2001, were included in the package of 
market-opening steps approved at the cabinet meeting. 
  The United States has said it will consider restarting 
collapsed bilateral trade "framework" talks depending on the 
contents of the package.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- Japan's top private banker 
praised the thrust of the government's new market-opening steps 
Tuesday [29 March] but said more detail is needed to restart 
Japan-U.S. trade "framework" talks. 
  Tadashi Okuda, chairman of the Federation of Bankers 
Associations of Japan, said the government is taking the right 
steps to aim at further opening Japan's markets and cut the 
country's mounting current account surplus. But he noted the 
package approved at a morning cabinet meeting just set out the 
directions for further steps and that "almost all the main parts 
are to come in June." 
  Okuda called for the measures to be fleshed out quickly, 
saying otherwise there can be no breakthrough in the stalled 
bilateral talks. 
  U.S. officials have said they would weigh the Japanese 
proposals in considering whether to restart the trade talks that 
fell apart in February over disagreement over the use of 
numerical indicators to gauge progress in opening Japan's 
markets. 
  Okuda, who is also president of Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank, 
blasted 
U.S. legislation that would retaliate against foreign financial 
services deemed to be closed to outside competitors. The fair 
trade in financial services bill, which passed the U.S. Senate 
this month and is expected to clear the House of Representatives 
and be signed into law by President Bill Clinton, would violate 
the "nondiscriminatory principle" of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Okuda said. 
  Okuda said the economy, which is on the verge of bottoming 
out, is at a delicate stage of "seeking timing." If Diet 
deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget is greatly delayed, it 
would hurt consumer and corporate sentiment, he said. 
  The cabinet Tuesday approved a 50-day, 11 trillion yen 
provisional budget as budget deliberations for the fiscal year 
starting Friday remain deadlocked in the Diet. 
  He also defended Japan's financial industry against 
criticism 
of a "pack" mentality and lack of innovation, leveled last week 
by Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno. Okuda said the 
industry has been highly regulated but pointed to recent 
deregulatory steps, saying competition and innovation will grow 
as deregulation proceeds. 
  He also said the bankers' federation agreed at a Tuesday 
meeting to review its disclosure regulations in line with a 
Finance Ministry report calling for steps such as the disclosure 
of business results for bank subsidiaries moving into the 
securities and trust banking businesses.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- Business leaders showed 
mixed reaction Tuesday [29 March] to a new market-opening plan 
unveiled by the government earlier in the day to reduce the 
country's huge current account surplus. 
  Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren), said he generally appreciates the 
program, saying it shows the government's determination to take 
necessary measures to open Japanese markets. 
  Masaru Hayami, head of the Japan Association of Corporate 
Executives (Keizai Doyukai), urged the government to implement 
the package in steady steps. 
  Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, said the program contains little substance. 
  Hiraiwa and Hayami called for tax cuts over a three-year 
period and an increase of over 100 trillion yen in outlays for 
public works projects. 
  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. said it will review a 
procurement agreement reached between Japan and the United 
States in 1981 and provide more information concerning its 
procurement to foreign suppliers. The giant domestic 
telecommunications firm said it opposes any move to include its 
procurement plans in a governmental framework. 
  The insurance industry expressed hope that business leaders 
of both countries will negotiate for the opening of the Japanese 
insurance market. 
  The automobile industry insisted the question of Japanese 
auto parts procurement from U.S. suppliers be settled through 
industry-level talks.

Hata met Tuesday with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale 
and expressed hope that Japan's new package of market-opening 
measures will lead to a resumption of the bilateral "framework" 
trade talks, Japanese officials said. 
  In the meeting held in the Diet building, Hata explained to 
Mondale a package of macroeconomic measures the government 
unveiled earlier Tuesday to spur domestic demand, market-opening 
measures and overtures in the framework talks, the officials 
said. 
  The framework talks collapsed at the Japan-U.S. summit in 
Washington February 11. 
  Mondale told Hata he will carefully study the 
English-language text of the package that he received from Hata, 
the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- Honda Motor Co. and Mazda 
Motor Corp. announced plans Tuesday [29 March] to boost imports 
of U.S.-made auto parts, following similar announcements the 
previous day by two other Japanese automakers. 
  The move reflects the automobile industry's effort to play a 
part in bridging the gap between Japan and the United States in 
their bilateral "framework" trade talks. 
  Honda Motor said it will locally procure U.S.-made auto 
parts 
worth 4.65 billion dollars for fiscal 1995, up 6 percent from 
its fiscal 1994 plan it set in 1992. The company will also 
import auto parts worth 540 million dollars, most of which is 
seen to be from the U.S. 
  Mazda Motor said it will purchase 2.25 billion dollars worth 
of U.S.-made auto parts in fiscal 1997, procuring 1.9 billion 
dollars worth locally. Of the 870 million dollars worth of auto 
parts the company plans to import worldwide, about 40 percent is 
seen to be from the U.S., the company said. 
  Mazda also said it will boost sales of cars imported from 
Ford Motor Co. of the U.S.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- The Japanese Government 
announced Tuesday [29 March] it will abolish a voluntary cap on 
car exports to the United States for fiscal 1994. Continuation 
of the decade-old trade practice will not serve the interest of 
either Japan or the United States, International Trade and 
Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai told a news conference. 
  Kumagai explained that U.S.-bound Japanese auto shipments 
have been dwindling and stayed below annual ceilings in recent 
years. 
  "The step has lost its originally intended function of 
easing 
trade friction between Tokyo and Washington," Kumagai said. 
  The step is also against new trade frameworks established 
under the recently concluded general agreement on tariffs and 
trade (GATT), Kumagai said. 
  Kumagai said Japan's auto exports to the U.S. are on the 
decline due to increased production by Japanese makers at their 
U.S. plants in the wake of the yen's appreciation against the 
dollar in recent years. 
  Improving performances of U.S. carmakers have also helped 
prevent robust sales in the U.S. of Japanese cars as seen 10 
years ago, Kumagai said. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) 
introduced annual ceilings on U.S.-bound Japanese car shipments 
in fiscal 1981 as a tool to correct huge trade imbalance 
lopsidedly in favor of Tokyo. 
  In the first six years, export records totaled exactly the 
same amount as respective year's ceiling that was set at 1.68 
million vehicles in the first year, reflecting brisk sales of 
Japanese cars in the U.S. But exports began dropping in fiscal 
1987, affected by successive launches of local production by 
Japanese makers via transplants. 
  As a result, shipments have been below set limits in the 
past 
six years, despite a cut to 1.65 million vehicles in ceilings in 
fiscal 1992 compared with a peak ceiling of 2.3 million vehicles 
during fiscal 1985-1991. 
  In fiscal 1992, exports totaled 1.57 million vehicles 
against 
the 1.65 million ceiling. 
  For the current year, shipments are expected to stand at 
1.39 
million units, also falling short of the 1.65 million ceiling, 
MITI said. 
  The current voluntary restraint arrangement expires 
Thursday. 
  Kumagai said the MITI decision is in line with the global 
trade accord calling for terminating practices such as voluntary 
export restraints within four years. 
  Under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks 
concluded 
in December, GATT member countries basically agreed to regard 
voluntary export restraints as "gray areas" under GATT 
provisions and scrap them eventually. 
  Industry sources said the MITI decision reflects the 
ministry's judgment that Washington sees no further need for 
auto export restraints. 
  The sources pointed to remarks recently made by U.S. 
Undersecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten, who said it would be 
"a waste of time" for Tokyo to think that keeping the restraints 
would appease Washington in trade disputes. 
  The Japanese voluntary auto export restraints began in 1981 
at the request of Washington at a time when U.S. automakers were 
experiencing strong competition from Japanese makers that 
shipped a flood of small cars to the U.S. market in the wake of 
the outbreak of the first oil crisis in 1978.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- Japanese automakers on 
Tuesday [29 March] said the government's decision to end a 
voluntary cap on car exports to the United States is 
"appropriate." They also expected few impacts from the decision 
on their businesses because production in the U.S. now surpasses 
exports. 
  "We view it as an appropriate move amid increasing switches 
among Japanese carmakers to local production from exports," said 
Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor Corp. "We will pursue 
a further production shift in the future." 
  Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan Motor Co., also said 
the 
Japanese step is in line with an agreement in the Uruguay Round 
of multilateral trade talks, completed last December, which 
determined voluntary restraints on exports as a "grey-zone" 
measure. 
  The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association also said the 
step will have "no major impact on Japanese makers because 
U.S.-bound Japanese auto shipments have long stayed below annual 
ceilings." 
  Japanese makers, prompted by the yen's appreciation, have 
started to boost their production in the U.S. since the latter 
half of the 1980s. 
  In 1993, locally-made cars numbered 1.54 million units, 
exceeding exports in volume for the first time ever. 
  U.S.-bound exports have been below the ceilings since fiscal 
1987, and are expected to amount to 1.65 million units in fiscal 
1993 through March 31, 300,000 units short of the upper limit.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata said Tuesday [29 March] he will discuss the North Korean 
nuclear problem with his French counterpart Alain Juppe during 
his visit to Japan from Thursday. Hata, speaking to the day's 
session of the House of Councillors' Foreign Affairs Committee, 
said "international society should take a firm stance in unison 
against North Korea." 
  Hata also said, "It is necessary to leave a window for 
dialogue with the North. I want to talk frankly about the issue 
when Mr. Juppe comes." 
  Juppe is visiting Japan from Thursday through Sunday for 
talks with Hata, the Foreign Ministry said. 
  It is his third visit since assuming the post last April. 
Juppe will also pay a courtesy call on Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, the ministry said. 
  North Korea, which denies building a nuclear bomb, refused 
to 
allow experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
to freely inspect all its nuclear facilities. The IAEA 
dispatched its team to the North earlier this month but it was 
barred from inspecting one of the key sites.

for the economic development of five Latin American countries -- 
Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. 
  The bank said the fund will be used to purchase equipment 
necessary for economic development projects in the five nations. 
  The bank said it also pledged an untied loan of up to 3.5 
billion yen to Banco Latinoamericano de Exportaciones, S.A. 
(Bladex), a regional financing institution established in 1978 
by the central banks of 22 Latin American countries and private

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- Bangladesh's Prime Minister 
Begum Khaleda Ziaur voiced support for a permanent Japanese seat 
on the U.N. Security Council [UNSC] in talks Tuesday [29 March] 
with Japanese counterpart Morihiro Hosokawa, Foreign Ministry 
officials said. The officials said Ziaur, who arrived in Tokyo 
on Monday for a five-day visit, told Hosokawa that Bangladesh 
"strongly supports" a permanent seat for Japan on the Security 
Council. 
  She said Bangladesh is prepared to encourage other countries 
with which it has close ties to similarly support Japan to that 
end. The officials said she was apparently referring to other 
Islamic countries, members of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), 
and so-called least developed countries (LDC's). 
  Ziaur called for continued Japanese economic assistance and 
expressed gratitude for Japan's agreement earlier in the day to 
extend a 22.9 billion yen loan, including some 21.5 billion yen 
for construction of a five-kilometer road-cum-rail bridge over 
the Jamuna River. 
  The bridge, expected to serve as a vital link between the 
eastern and western parts of the country, is being cofinanced by 
the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, each contributing 
200 million dollars. 
  The officials said Hosokawa urged that the Bangladeshi 
Government ensure the residents of the area where the bridge is 
to be constructed are treated satisfactorily. They said it is 
estimated by the World Bank that 40,000 people will have to be 
relocated. 
  A second Japanese loan, worth some 1.4 billion yen, will go 
to fund a project to supply natural gas to the principal port 
city of Chittagong and its surrounding area. 
  The pledge of the two official loans, covering fiscal 1993, 
ending March 31, was formalized in an exchange of diplomatic 
notes between Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Bangladesh 
Finance Minister Saifur Rahman. 
  Japan is Bangladesh's top aid donor, providing 300 to 400 
million dollars a year in financial aid and other assistance. 
Foreign Ministry officials said Ziaur expressed a hope for more 
Japanese investment in her country, saying the investment 
environment is good and has received favorable reviews 
internationally. 
  In response, Hosokawa announced Japan's readiness to begin 
negotiations to conclude an agreement with Bangladesh on the 
promotion and protection of investment. 
  The officials said the expressed intention of the Japanese 
Government should be an important "signal" for the Japanese 
private sector to go ahead and boost investment in Bangladesh. 
Japan presently has concluded such agreements with only four 
countries -- China, Egypt, Sri Lanka and Turkey. 
  In addition to the talks with Hosokawa, Ziaur is scheduled 
to 
meet various Japanese business leaders and deliver a speech at 
an investment seminar Wednesday, they said. 
  In a speech at a dinner hosted by the Japanese premier, 
Ziaur 
urged Japan offer Bangladesh "special and differential 
opportunities for market access in Japan and in securing 
Japanese investments in our country." She said Bangladesh is 
planning to set up a special export processing zone "for 
Japanese investments alone." 
  Referring to the Security Council issue, Ziaur said, "The 
economic miracles achieved by Japan deserve to be translated 
into... (an) enhanced international political role." 
  "Bangladesh will continue to support the legitimate 
aspirations of Japan in the United Nations," she said. "To be 
more explicit, we are totally behind you in your effort to be a 
permanent member of the Security Council."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- The House of Councillors 
approved a set of bills for income tax cuts Tuesday [29 March], 
completing parliamentary action and ensuring tax reductions in 
June. The bills provide for a 20 percent reduction of the 
income tax in two stages -- first with summer bonus payments and 
second with the year-end adjustment of tax payments. 
  The local or resident tax will also be cut by 20 percent. 
  Government officials said the local tax will not be deducted 
from salaries for two months in June and July and collection of 
the annual levy will be divided equally over the remaining 10 
months from August. The officials said the amount of income and 
local tax reductions will amount to 106,600 yen for an average 
family with a wife and two children. 
  For nonwage-earning households, income tax adjustments will 
be made in July, November and March while the yearly amount of 
local tax payments will be cut by 20 percent in June, they said. 
  For high-income taxpayers, the ceilings of income and local 
tax cuts have been set at 2 million yen and 200,000 yen, 
respectively.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- A net liquidity surplus of 
5.70 trillion yen is expected in the banking system in April, 
the Bank of Japan [BOJ] said Tuesday [29 March]. The projected 
surplus -- excluding government bond issuance -- stems from 6.90 
trillion yen in net inflow of treasury funds against 1.20 
trillion yen in net cash outflow, the central bank said. 
  The net surplus is down from 7.34 trillion yen posted last 
April, with net cash outflow lower than a year-earlier 1.64 
trillion yen but net fiscal inflow also down from 8.98 trillion 
yen. 
  The outstanding cash balance is estimated to post a 
year-on-year 4.5 percent growth at the end of April, maintaining 
the recent uptrend in the 4 percent level, a bank official said. 
The expected lower cash outflow is due to a technical factor, 
the official said. 
  The net fiscal inflow includes 4.29 trillion yen in public 
works, up from 3.29 trillion yen, and 1.51 trillion yen in bond 
redemption, almost unchanged from 1.50 trillion yen. 
  The lower projection in fiscal inflow stems expected lower 
inflow from special accounts, including government-backed 
financial institutions. 
  The special account inflow is estimated at 830 billion yen, 
down from 1.12 trillion yen, resulting chiefly from expected 
smaller inflow from housing loans in reaction to the previous 
year's sharp rise.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- Major Japanese commercial 
banks plan to write off nonperforming debts worth more than 3 
trillion yen in fiscal 1993 ending Thursday [31 March] to speed 
up financial reconstruction, industry sources said Tuesday. The 
sources said the total amount to be liquidated by three 
long-term credit banks and seven trust banks will exceed 1 
trillion yen. 
  They said combined writeoffs by 11 major commercial banks, 
called city banks, will top 2 trillion yen. 
  The sources said the total amount of debt liquidation by the 
three long-term credit banks is estimated at 550 billion yen -- 
210 billion yen by the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB), 
140 billion yen by the Industrial Bank of Japan and 200 billion 
yen by Nippon Credit Bank. 
  The writeoff by LTCB compares with 94.1 billion yen 
liquidated by the bank last year. 
  The amount of writeoffs by the seven trust banks is certain 
to exceed 400 billion yen, the sources said. 
  Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. is studying whether to include 
a 
nonperforming loan of 80 billion yen to Azabu Tatemono in its 
writeoffs in the current fiscal year, they said. The company's 
writeoff will hit 130 billion yen, a record for a trust bank, if 
the loan to Azabu Tatemono is included, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- Japan's jobless rate in 
February rose 0.2 percentage point from the previous month to a 
seasonally adjusted 2.9 percent, the highest level in six years 
and eight months, the Management and Coordination Agency 
reported Tuesday [29 March]. 
  In a separate report, the Labor Ministry said the ratio of 
job offers to job seekers, an indicator of labor demand, fell 
from January's 0.67 to 0.65 in February, showing there were 65 
jobs for every 100 people seeking employment. The February 
jobless rate represents a rise of 0.6 point from a year earlier 
and the highest since June 1987 when it stood at 3.0 percent, 
the agency said. 
  The unemployment rate among women hit a record high at 3.2 
percent, topping the previous high of 3.1 percent marked in may 
1987. The latest figure compares with a 2.7 percent jobless 
rate among men. 
  Officials of the agency and the ministry said the nation's 
employment data is likely to worsen further in the months ahead 
although some bright signs can be observed in the economy as a 
whole. 
  The number of jobholders in February rose 0.3 percent or 
160,000 from a year earlier to 63.02 million, down from a climb 
of 0.5 percent or 300,000 in the previous month. The number of 
unemployed workers jumped 23.6 percent or 370,000 to 1.94 
million. 
  In the manufacturing sector, jobholders declined 3.2 percent 
or 480,000, continuing the streak of declines since November 
1992. Manufacturers are shifting their production overseas to 
stay competitive amid the appreciation of the yen on the foreign 
exchange. 
  Jobholders in the construction industry grew 2.5 percent or 
160,000. 
  Improvement was seen in the wholesale, retail and food 
sectors, with jobholders there growing 0.8 percent or 120,000. 
The climb in employees in the service sector, however, was 
trimmed, at 1.6 percent or 240,000.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo TV Asahi Network in Japanese at 
0100 GMT on 27 March, in its regularly-scheduled "Sunday 
Project" program, carries a 20-minute interview with Yoshiro 
Mori, secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], 
by political commentator Soichiro Tahara. In the interview, 
Mori discusses the LDP policy to continue pressuring Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa over questionable loans totalling 100 
million yen received from the scandal-tainted trucking company 
Sagawa Kyubin. 
  Asked why the LDP is so eager to pursue Hosokawa's 
responsibility, Mori stated: "We are just following a Diet 
resolution. When we enacted the fiscal 1993 supplementary 
budget, Lower House Budget Committee Chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi 
of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] proposed a 
resolution according to Article 104 of the Diet Administration 
Law." He adds: "The resolution was adopted at the lower house 
plenary session with no opposition. All parties--including 
Hosokawa's Japan New Party [JNP], the Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party], Komeito, and the SDPJ--said yes to the resolution." 
"The Diet is formally demanding the government--the tax office, 
the prosecutors, or the prime minister himself--make up for 
deficient documents submitted by the prime minister, but the 
government has not shown an appropriate response. This is why 
Diet sessions are deadlocked." Mori adds that sooner or later 
"Hosokawa will have to take responsibility" for the political 
turmoil. 
  Regarding the LDP's future course of action, Mori stresses 
his stance to continue boycotting Diet sessions as long as 
Hosokawa remains silent about the issue, saying: "If Hosokawa 
keeps refusing the Diet's request, the enactment of the 1994 
budget will be further delayed." Asked if he intends to urge 
Hosokawa's resignation, Mori replies: "To take responsibility 
for his actions, Hosokawa will be forced to dissolve either his 
administration or the lower house." 
  Mori continues: "When a person wants to borrow money, he or 
she usually goes to a bank. If somebody borrows a large amount 
of money from a trucking company, this person may have a special 
relationship with the company, or the loan may be given under 
favorable conditions. Hosokawa did that while a public 
official, yet he is advocating visibility in politics and 
elimination of corruption. If those are still regarded as the 
basis of political reform, he must speak out. The LDP is not 
responsible for the turmoil."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- The government compiled on 
Tuesday a 50-day provisional budget for fiscal 1994 with a 
record outlay of 11.05 trillion yen to bridge the delay in Diet 
passage of the full budget. The stopgap budget formed by the 
Finance Ministry was endorsed by the ruling coalition parties 
and the cabinet of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for 
immediate submission to the current ordinary Diet session. 
  A ministry official, briefing reporters, stressed that the 
economy is unlikely to face downward pressure with a failure to 
enact the full budget before Friday's start of fiscal 1994. But 
the delay in fact means a slower output of spending earmarked in 
the full budget, with the government aiming to put the economy 
on a path to full recovery in the early stage of fiscal 1994. 
  If deliberations go smoothly, the provisional budget is 
expected to become law on Thursday. 
  The Diet is now stalled in its deliberations on the fiscal 
1994 budget plan worth 73.08 trillion yen, with the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party demanding Hosokawa give a full 
accounting of a 100 million yen loan he received from the 
scandal-ridden Sagawa Kyubin trucking group. 
  The full budget was submitted to the Diet as late as March 
for the first time in 27 years, already two months behind 
schedule, and the Diet impasse has made it certain that 
administrative bodies will enter the new fiscal year without the 
funds to keep functioning. 
  The Finance Ministry also compiled a provisional plan worth 
9.84 trillion yen for the fiscal investment and loans program, 
also approved by the government and the ruling parties. The 
program, regarded as a second national budget, allocates funds 
to government-backed financial institutions and other special 
bodies. 
  Even though the stopgap budget excludes new policy spending, 
the ministry budget bureau official said the government has 
earmarked sufficient fresh public works and other 
economy-stimulating outlays in the third fiscal 1993 
supplementary budget, which became law in February, to fund 
large chunks of the latest 15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus 
package. 
  The provisional budget earmarks 2.78 trillion yen in 
spending 
related to public works, about 30 percent of outlays included in 
the full budget, to finance works carried over from fiscal 1993 
and a roughly estimated amount usually necessary for the first 
50-day period. 
  A minimum necessary 14 percent is included for labor, 
operating and other administrative expenses to keep the 
government functioning. 
  Among other major expenditures, the provisional budget 
allocates 2.20 trillion yen in social welfare spending from 
13.48 trillion yen in the full budget, and 3.65 trillion yen in 
tax grants to local governments from the full 12.76 trillion yen. 
  On the revenue side, the ministry estimates 3.83 trillion 
yen 
in the 50-day period, including 1.22 trillion yen in tax income 
and 2.47 trillion yen in bond issuance. 
  To cover the estimated revenue shortfall of 7.23 trillion 
yen, the ministry plans to raise funds by issuing short-term 
treasury securities. 
  The 50-day provisional period is the second-longest in 
postwar history -- matching those in fiscal 1987, 1989 and 1990 
when Japan also compiled stopgap budgets. 
  The ministry official said the 50-day period reflected the 
average 48 days taken in the past three years for the full 
budget to pass the House of Representatives. After passing the 
powerful lower house, budget bills are sent to the House of 
Councillors which is relatively quick in completing 
deliberations. 
  The government apparently hopes that deliberations on the 
stopgap budget will heighten public awareness and pressure 
opposition parties to accept debates on the full budget. 
  Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a regular press 
meeting 
on Monday that budgets should normally be passed before the 
fiscal year begins, and called for Diet passage "as early as 
possible."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's Diet testimony over the purchase of 300 Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) shares is false, an 
investment consultant said Tuesday [29 March]. 
  Hosokawa has told the Diet that he only helped his 
father-in-law buy the shares by putting up a condominium as 
collateral to finance the purchase. But "the NTT share 
transaction is what Prime Minister Hosokawa himself asked for. 
His father-in-law only allowed his name to be used by Hosokawa 
for the transaction," the 60-year-old consultant said on 
condition of anonymity. 
  The consultant told KYODO NEWS SERVICE he himself 
recommended 
the NTT share purchase to Hosokawa via one of Hosokawa's aides. 
He said he is willing to testify before the Diet about his 
allegations. 
  Hosokawa's father-in-law, Shohei Ueda, the father of 
Hosokawa's wife, Kayoko, died last May. 
  The premier has repeatedly told the Diet he merely complied 
with his father-in-law's request to put up his own condominium 
as collateral to secure a loan to finance the NTT share 
purchase. He has said he financed the purchase of the 
condominium in Tokyo's Motoazabu area with part of a 100 million 
yen loan he borrowed in 1982 from the Sagawa Kyubin trucking 
group, a company at the center of a money-and-mob scandal. 
  Japan Communist Party legislator Zenmei Matsumoto said he 
would press Hosokawa during Wednesday's parliamentary session to 
account for the inconsistency between the premier's statements 
and the consultant's allegations. 
  Hosokawa's political office said, "the transaction is a 
legal 
economic activity taken by the premier's father-in-law and the 
premier himself did not initiate the deal." 
  The consultant said he approached the aide of then Kumamoto 
Gov. Hosokawa in the fall of 1986 with an offer to act as an 
intermediary for acquiring NTT shares, before NTT solicited bids 
for its shares for the first time on October 4, 1986. He said 
Hosokawa expressed his willingness to tender his bids for the 
shares after the aide explained about NTT share investment in a 
conversation in early September of that year at the governor's 
office. 
  The aide and the consultant introduced Masatoshi Miyama, 
Hosokawa's top financial secretary, to a Tokyo-based stock 
investment financing company, he said. Miyama offered to borrow 
the money for the share purchase in the name of Hosokawa's 
father-in-law, he said. 
  The financing contract called for putting up both the NTT 
shares and the premier's condominium as collateral, he said. 
  The Hosokawa side succeeded in acquiring all 300 NTT shares 
for which he had submitted bids. Six months after NTT floated 
the shares on the Tokyo stock exchange in February 1987, Miyama 
sold off 199 of the shares, raking in handsome profits, he said. 
  Even after Hosokawa repaid the funds borrowed for the share 
purchase, he ended up securing a net investment profit of some 
50 million yen, he said. 
  Miyama broke a promise to have the consultant dictate the 
timing of any selloff of NTT shares, while giving the consultant 
10 percent of the net profit from the sell-offs, he said. The 
consultant obtained only part of what Hosokawa's camp had agreed 
to pay to him, he said. 
  The consultant said he cannot identify who first conveyed 
the 
investment offer to Hosokawa "to prevent the publicity from 
causing annoyances" to the aide.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- The leader of the largest 
party in the ruling coalition on Tuesday [29 March] expressed 
opposition to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's plan to form a 
study group involving all the seven ruling parties if the group 
is intended for creating a new party. 
  Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] Chairman 
Tomiichi Murayama told a news conference that it is time for all 
the coalition members to take a united front in helping Diet 
debate on the fiscal 1994 state budget go smoothly. Murayama 
said any move that threatens the unity of the coalition should 
be avoided. 
  Murayama said he relayed his thoughts to Hosokawa when he 
visited the premier at his official residence last week to 
inquire about news reports that the planned coalition study 
group is a preliminary step before establishing a new party. 
  Mass media reports said that a prerequisite for joining the 
group is support for choosing joint candidates under the new 
electoral system for the House of Representatives. 
  Hosokawa said earlier this month the coalition would be at a 
disadvantage in the next general election unless it overcomes 
internal rivalry and agrees to file a joint candidate in each of 
300 single-seat constituencies. 
  If joining the study group is a condition to be selected as 
a 
joint candidate or if the group is designed to create a new 
party, "I would not be able to agree" to let SDP legislators 
participate, Murayama said. But he added the SDP has no plan at 
the moment to decide on whether to allow party ranks to join the 
study group and instead will keep watch over political 
developments.

  [Text] United Nations, March 25 (YONHAP) -- The U.N. 
Security Council [UNSC] on Friday circulated among its 15 member 
countries a draft resolution asking the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) to report back to the council on whether 
North Korea has fulfilled its nuclear safeguards obligations 
within one month of the resolution's adoption. 
  The U.S.-drafted resolution indirectly warns that unless 
North Korea accepts further IAEA inspections within a month of 
its adoption, the Security Council will take additional action. 
  The draft was circulated at a closed-door session held 
Friday 
afternoon local time. 
  In addition, the draft resolution states that the Security 
Council will continue to handle the North Korean nuclear 
question and will, if necessary, consider further action. 
  A source here said that most Security Council members, 
including such permanent members as the United Kingdom, France 
and Russia, support the draft. China and Pakistan are opposed, 
he said. 
  Earlier in the day, China, through individual contacts with 
other member countries, advocated adopting a statement by the 
council president instead of a resolution. 
  At the afternoon session, however, China stressed that the 
manifestation of the council's posture should be affirmative, 
objective and moderate in content, according to British 
Ambassador David Hannay. 
  Chinese Deputy Ambassador Chen Jian left halfway through the 
meeting and told reporters that the nuclear issue is very 
sensitive and should be resolved through continued negotiations 
among the parties involved. 
  Ambassador Hannay said a broad consensus had been reached on 
the draft resolution among council members. He foresaw few 
problems in its passage. 
  Russian Ambassador Yuriy Boronchev expressed support for the 
draft resolution, saying that it contained the minimum necessary 
items. 
  The resolution will likely be put to a vote toward the end 
of 
this month, Ambassador Hannay said. 
  The Security Council will meet behind closed doors again on 
March 28 to continue discussing the draft.

  (Text) United Nations -- Following is the text of a 
proposed Security Council resolution calling on North Korea to 
permit completion of an inspection by a team from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify there has 
been no diversion of nuclear materials. 
  IAEA inspectors were in North Korea from March 3 to 14 but 
the agency says they were not allowed to carry out all required 
activities. 
  The resolution, still subject to amendment, is expected to 
be 
voted on some time next week. 
  The Security Council, 
  --Recalling its resolution 825 (1993), and the statement 
made 
by the President of the Council on 9 April 1993, 
  --Reaffirming the critical importance of International 
Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards in the implementation of the 
Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (the Treaty) 
and the contribution which progress in nonproliferation makes to 
the maintenance of international peace and security, 
  --Endorsing and commending the efforts of the 
Director-General of the IAEA and the IAEA Secretariat to 
implement the IAEA-Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) 
safeguards agreement (INFCIRC/403) 
  --Recalling the expressed willingness of the DPRK to seek a 
proper settlement of the nuclear safeguards issue in the DPRK 
within the framework of resolution 825 (1993), 
  --Reaffirming the importance of the Joint Declaration by the 
DPRK and the Republic of Korea (ROK) on the denuclearization of 
the Korean peninsula, and of the parties to that declaration 
addressing the nuclear issue in their continuing dialogue, 
  --Having considered with grave concern the IAEA Board of 
Governors' findings contained in its resolution of 21 March 1994 
that the DPRK is in further non-compliance with its safeguards 
agreement, and has aggravated this situation by not allowing 
IAEA inspectors, as agreed between the IAEA and DPRK on 15 
February 1994, to conduct indispensable inspection activities at 
their seven declared nuclear sites, 
  --Deploring the fact that the IAEA is, therefore, still 
unable to verify that there has been no diversion of nuclear 
material required to be safeguarded under the terms of the 
IAEA-DPRK safeguards agreement to nuclear weapons or other 
nuclear explosive devices, 
  1. Urges the DPRK to allow the IAEA inspectors to complete 
the inspection activities agreed between the IAEA and the DPRK 
on Feb. 15 1994, as the first step in fulfilling its obligations 
under the IAEA-DPRK safeguards agreement and in honoring its 
nonproliferation obligations under the Treaty; 
  2. Requests the director-general of the IAEA to report to 
the Security Council within one month of the adoption of the 
present resolution on the implementation of the IAEA-DPRK 
safeguards agreement; 
  3. Requests the DPRK and ROK to renew discussions whose 
purpose is implementation of the Joint Declaration on the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula; 
  4. Requests further that those member states engaged in 
dialogue with the DPRK to facilitate a solution in accordance 
with resolution 825 (1993) continue that dialogue, after the 
IAEA completes all inspections at their seven declared nuclear 
sites necessary to verify that there has been no diversion of 
nuclear material since earlier inspections; 
  5. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter and to 
consider further Security Council action if necessary.

  [Text] Seoul, March 29 (YONHAP) -- Russia would support a 
United Nations Security Council resolution calling on North 
Korea to accept nuclear inspections, while seeking an 
international meeting to discuss the issue attended by South and 
North Korea, the United States, Japan, Russia, China, the United 
Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], Radio 
Moscow reported Monday. 
  According to NAEWOE PRESS, Seoul's official monitor of 
communist countries' news media, the radio said, "Moscow would 
support a UN Security Council resolution calling for North Korea 
to observe its obligations to the IAEA under the framework of 
the nuclear non- proliferation treaty." 
  Moreover, Russia thinks that neighboring countries' efforts 
to solve the problem are not enough so it will try to hold an 
international meeting of delegates from South and North Korea, 
Japan, Russia, China, the United States, the UN 
secretary-general and the IAEA director-general, the radio said. 
  Radio Moscow, citing the scheduled deployment of Patriot 
missiles in South Korea and Pyongyang's objections to the move, 
said, "the tension on the Korean peninsula is worsening and

  [Text] It has been learned that ROK Foreign Minister Han 
Sung- chu will attend the UN Security Council meeting on 31 
March to deliver a speech in support of approaching the North 
Korean nuclear issue with a statement by the UN Security 
Council. This will be the first time an ROK foreign minister 
has officially presented the ROK Government's position before 
the UN Security Council. Noting that the current crisis on the 
Korean peninsula is caused by lack of guarantee on North Korea's 
nuclear transparency, Minister Han Sung-chu will urge additional 
inspections on North Korean nuclear facilities. Minister Han 
Sung-chu will also stress that the international community's 
alliance system needs to be firm in order to resolve the North 
Korean nuclear issue and that an extreme situation should not 
develop on the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Bangkok, March 29 (YONHAP) -- A senior North Korean 
official here asserted on Tuesday that the United States is to 
be blamed for the tension on the Korean peninsula over the 
nuclear question, arguing that peaceful resolution of the 
nuclear issue is up entirely to the United States. 
  In a prepared statement at a press conference held at the 
Foreign Correspondents Club here in Bangkok, North Korean 
Ambassador to Thailand Yi To-son said the only method of 
peaceful settlement of the nuclear question is for North Korea 
and the United States to adopt a "package deal." 
  On the possibility of North Korea's acceptance of 
re-inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), 
Yi said, "this, too, depends on the outcome of our negotiations 
with the United States because the nuclear question lies not in 
technical matters but in political ones." 
  The North Korean envoy stressed that North Korea will under 
no circumstance be the first to unleash an armed provocation 
over the nuclear question. 
  He said if South Korea and the United States invade North 
Korea, "our country would be destroyed." 
  Asked what would become of the North Korean economy if the 
UN 
Security Council adopts a sanction against North Korea, Yi said 
that even if a sanction were applied, North Korea would fully 
stand it because "we have run our economy on our own with our 
technology, resources, work forces and facilities over a long 
period of time." 
  He added that his understanding is that Japan and the United 
States have already begun to apply economic sanctions against 
North Korea. 
  Yi also charged the United States with taking the lead in 
efforts to invoke a sanction against North Korea through the 
U.N. Security Council by pushing ahead with the deployment of 
Patriot missiles in Korea and staging of the Team Spirit 
military exercise as planned. 
  "All pressures against us would only delay the settlement of 
the nuclear issues and make the problem more complicated, 
leading North Korea to withdraw competely from the nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty," he said. 
  Regarding the issue of exchanging special envoys between 
South and North Korea, Yi asserted that "South Korea distorted 
the significance of the proposed exchange of special envoys by 
making it appear as if the exchange is designed merely to 
discuss the nuclear issue." 
  "South Korea has thus applied a brake to the dialogue 
between 
North Korea and the United States," he said.

  [Text] Leaders of the main opposition Democratic Party [DP] 
are greatly embarrassed these days by the worsening North Korea 
nuclear row. 
  The DP has had to change part of its North Korean policy 
after a Pyongyang official threatened to turn Seoul into "a sea 
of fire" last week. 
  The party had insisted on a peaceful solution of the nuclear 
issue through dialogue. 
  The party used to stress an "independent" diplomacy, calling 
for talks among the three concerned parties--South and North 
Korea and the United States. 
  But signs of changes in the DP's stance on the North Korean 
issue have been increasingly conspicuous since last week. 
  Some DP lawmakers have carefully raised the opinion that the 
government should refer the nuclear problem to two-way talks 
between Pyongyang and Washington. 
  They insist that exchange of special envoys between South 
and 
North Korea should not be a precondition to the IAEA's 
full-scale inspection of the North's nuclear facilities. 
  "Instead, the government has to concentrate on closer 
economic exchange with the North," a senior DP official said. 
  "The principle of independent diplomacy should be changed, 
depending on the circumstances," he said. 
  DP leaders have rushed to plan a strategy to cope with the 
rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula. 
  Members of the DP Supreme Council have met every day since 
last week to decide the party's official position toward the 
ongoing crisis in the inter-Korean relations. 
  However, they have failed to reach consensus so far because 
of sharply dissenting views among them. 
  The DP leaders complained that the Seoul government is 
largely responsible for both the deadlock in the nuclear problem 
and the rupture of the inter-Korean talks. 
  "Our security-related authorities lack consistent North 
Korean policies. They have vacillated between tough and 
moderate lines," a Supreme Council member said. 
  Despite some signs of change, the DP remains unchanged in 
its 
stance toward the North Korean problem in many areas.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Yi Song-yul] </F>
  [Text] Following North Korea's repeated intimidation of 
going to war against the South and the United States, the 
pro-con debates on the resumption of Team Spirit military 
exercise and deployment of Patriot anti-air missiles in the 
South seem to have almost ended. 
  During the months leading to an inter-Korea contact last 
week 
when a North Korea official said that "Seoul would turn into a 
sea of flames," not a few South Koreans had opposed or sounded 
notes of caution about any military approach toward the issue 
surrounding North Korea's nuclear issue. 
  But now, such voices of caution or opposition have nearly 
disappeared in the South. 
  Those who had called for "prudence" are now silent to the 
argument that "North Koreans already possess Scud and Nodong 
missiles, some of which can even hit Japan and Taiwan, so we 
should not oppose deployment of the defensive Patriot 
antimissile missiles to U.S. Forces Korea." 
  They previously suggested that the deployment may 
"unnecessarily irritate" North Koreans, calling for continued 
dialogue with North Koreans in settling the North Korean nuclear 
issue. 
  The opposition Democratic Party also called for prudence on 
the part of Seoul and Washington in deciding deployment of 
Patriots and resumption of Team Spirit, the annual joint 
military exercise. 
  Others who welcome Patriot missiles say that deployment of 
the anti-air missiles to the U.S. forces in South Korea "is the 
minimum defensive gesture Seoul and Washington can and should 
take at this moment." 
  "Patriots are a purely defensive weapon, and what's wrong 
with the defending forces having them?" said a Defense Ministry 
official. "And is it okay that jingoistic and bellicose North 
Koreans develop and possess offensive Scud and Nodong missiles?" 
  Regarding resumption of Team Spirit '94, "we have crossed 
the 
Rubicon," as a Defense Ministry official puts it. 
  Six Patriot batteries and 850 U.S. Army soldiers have 
already been shipped from Fort Bliss, Tex., most probably to 
take part in Team Spirit, which, previously scheduled for late 
March, should be rescheduled. 
  Shortly after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
decided that its recent inspections of nuclear sites in the 
North had been unsatisfactory, U.S. President Bill Clinton 
announced he had approved shipping the Patriot batteries to 
South Korea. Before that, President Kim Yong-sam in Seoul 
announced agreement to the Patriots deployment and resumption of 
Team Spirit. 
  But the military move will be slow--the six missile 
batteries 
will take four to six weeks to reach South Korea. That leaves 
plenty of time for Seoul and Washington to try diplomatic and 
economic pressure to pry open North Korea's suspected nuclear 
sites for full-fledged international inspection. 
  North Korea, which has intentionally broken inter-Korean 
dialogue, fervently condemned the move to send Patriot batteries 
to the South and resume Team Spirit joint military exercise. 
  The North Korean ambassador to China said holding the 
exercise and deploying the missiles could lead to war. 
  But Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae said Wednesday that 
resumption of the exercise had become inevitable since North 
Korea has not met two preconditions Seoul and Washington 
officials set for its suspension. 
  "When the exercise timetable is set after President Kim's 
return from state visits to Tokyo and Beijing March 30, it 
cannot be suspended again since that would have a negative 
effect on troop morale," Yi said before a National Assembly 
Committee. 
  Now it seems certain that Team Spirit for this year will be 
conducted, with the participation of Patriot missiles, more 
South Korean and U.S. troops and more warships. 
  Defense Ministry officials said the Patriots being sent here 
are an improved version of the missiles used during the Gulf War 
and can effectively counter North Korean Scuds. 
  The 48 launchers being sent are capable of intercepting as 
many as 54 targets simultaneously, the officials said. 
  A typical Patriot battalion is comprised of three to six 
batteries, with eight launchers each. Each launcher has four 
missiles. 
  So far, the only shots fired have been verbal, if 
incendiary, 
but much seems to depend on Pyongyang's attitude before real 
shots are fired.

  [Text] Seoul, March 26 (YONHAP) -- The North Korean nuclear 
dispute is a huge obstacle to attracting foreign tourists in 
"Visit Korea Year '94," tourism sources said Saturday. 
  News media in the United States and Japan carried successive 
stories on issues related to the nuclear problem this week, 
including possible United Nations sanctions against North Korea, 
deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea and growing 
tension on the peninsula, all of which have probably discouraged 
foreigners from wanting to visit. 
  Many foreign tourists are voicing concerns to the overseas 
offices of the Korea National Tourism Corp. (KNTC), hotels and 
travel agents about their safety in Seoul. 
  This is partly caused by exaggerated reports on the nuclear 
row carried by the American media, the sources said. 
  The U.S. State Department has yet to designate South Korea 
as 
a danger area in its travel advisory, but if the United Nations 
imposes economic sanctions on the North or Patriot missiles are 
deployed in the South, the country is likely to earn this 
dubious distinction. 
  The travel advisory is important since other nations' 
tourism 
industries regard it as a reliable recommendation: If South 
Korea is listed as a dangerous area, the number of foreign 
tourists is likely to decline sharply, the sources said. 
  Some Japanese tourists, citing deep concerns about the 
nuclear problem, have canceled planned visits to Seoul in April 
and May. Japanese account for nearly half of the total foreign 
tourists, so their cancellation of tours to South Korea will 
weaken the tourism industry here. 
  The director-general of the Tourism Bureau at the 
Transportation Ministry, Chong Chong-hwan, said, "it has not 
reached a point where tourists should worry much about the 
problem now. But we have ordered the overseas offices of the 
KNTC to ensure that foreigners know their security is guaranteed 
here."

  [Text] Seoul, March 26 (YONHAP) -- The stock market turned 
in a bleak performance in a week influenced by strained 
inter-Korean relations and rumors of financial difficulties 
among listed firms. 
  The leading composite stock price index slid 21.31 points in 
the week ending Saturday, March 26, from 893.99 the previous 
Saturday to 872.68. 
  Early in the week, share prices took a downturn due to the 
buildup of tension over the North Korean nuclear question and an 
anticipated financial pinch toward the end of the month. 
  Late in the week prices rebounded, fueled by rising small- 
and medium-sized issues and rumors of additional market 
deregulation. 
  But the rise was short-lived with prices again falling amid 
rumors that some listed firms were beset with financial problems 
and heavy selling by institutional investors. 
  Nearly all issues other than fisheries, prefabricated metal 
and miscellaneous manufacturing declined. The slide in the 
insurance, inland transportation and lumber sectors was 
especially steep. 
  Volume in the week was 180.52 million shares, a drop of 19.9 
percent from the previous week when it stood at 216.40 million 
shares. The daily average was 30.08 million. 
  Turnover amounted to 3,091 billion won or 515.2 billion won 
a 
day compared with 4,232.6 billion won (705.4 billion won a day) 
the previous week. 
  During the week, institutional investors bought more than 
they sold while foreign investors did far more selling than 
buying. 
  Institutional investors' selling amounted to 719.4 billion 
won or 21.7 percent of the total while their buying came to 
794.7 billion won (23.9 percent). 
  Selling by foreign investors reached 146.4 billion won and 
they bought shares worth 42.2 billion won, representing 4.4 and 
1.3 percent of the total, respectively. In the previous week, 
foreigners sold shares worth 64.0 billion won and purchased 49.8 
billion won worth. 
  Stock players' deposits declined 48.9 billion won in the 
week 
ending March 24 from 3,320.9 billion won on March 17 to 3,271.9 
billion won. 
  Market analysts said that favorable future factors for the 
Korean bourse include the economy's reported entry into a full 
recovery course, President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China and 
permission for listed firms to purchase their own shares 
beginning next month. 
  On the other hand, adverse factors include strained 
inter-Korean relations over the nuclear question, growing demand 
for funds by companies toward the end of the month, predominant 
selling by foreign investors and an anticipated deterioration of 
market demand and supply conditions, the analysts said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 28 (YONHAP) -- A Defense Ministry 
official on Monday denied the ASAHI SHIMBUN report that South 
Korea seems to have cancelled its plan to resume the '94 Team 
Spirit military exercise. 
  "No decision has been made on such a cancellation," the 
official said. 
  In a dispatch from Seoul, the Japanese daily said Monday it 
appears South Korea scrapped a plan to resume the '94 Team 
Spirit military exercise, a plan which Seoul made following 
North Korea's rejection of overall nuclear inspection by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  ASAHI said that a final decision on the withdrawal of the 
plan to resume the joint Korea-U.S. exercise would be made after 
South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, now accompanying 
President Kim Yong-sam to China, would fly to Washington 
following his Beijing visit and inform the U.S. of the Seoul 
decision.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Super 301 Provision and the Uruguay Round"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. Government is likely to make strong 
demands on our country's opening of its auto market in the 16th 
ROK-U.S. working-level trade talks to be held 4-5 April in 
Washington. This demand is not new. In previous working-level 
talks held in Seoul in early March, the United States also 
demanded that the ROK call off its differential tariff and tax 
rate system as well as lower tariff rates to promote imports of 
large U.S. cars. However, we are particularly concerned with 
the upcoming talks because the United States has implicitly 
warned that "it may invoke the Super 301 provision unless the 
ROK opens its auto market." The U.S. Government announced in 
March that it will revive the Super 301 provision in two years. 
It intends to spot by 30 September "countries that are unfairly 
controlling imports of U.S. goods" as "target countries for 
priority negotiations" and demand that they call off or adjust 
their "unfair import controls." The United States also intends 
to take retaliatory procedures against them unless these 
countries meet demands. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor insists that the 
revival of the Super 301 provision coincides with the principle 
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] and it is 
not aimed at a specific country. Countries interpret his 
insistence differently. Japan, is particularly opposed to this, 
saying that it will file a lawsuit to the GATT if the United 
States imposes trade retaliation according to the Super 301 
clause. Our government also criticized the clause for clearly 
contradicting the spirit of the Uruguay Round [UR] negotiations. 
In the GATT Board of Governors meeting held last week, major 
member nations of the Board of Governors denounced the Super 301 
provision as a means for unilateral trade retaliation and 
criticized it for threatening the inauguration of the 
multilateral UR trade system. 
  The United States is searching for excuses in saying that it 
intends not to close U.S. markets, but to expand free trade by 
opening other countries' markets wider. The U.S. intends to 
remove trade barriers to open the market of each of its trade 
partners, through multilateral agreements whenever possible, and 
through bilateral negotiations, when neccessary. The United 
States sees the Super 301 clause as coinciding with UR 
principles since it considers the conclusion of UR negotiations 
a step towards market opening. 
  The U.S. insistence, however, must be based on an objective 
and universal view for the treaty to be proved fair and just. 
The UR negotiations have been concluded for this purpose. As 
the Super 301 clause unilaterally insisted upon by the U.S. as 
aiming only to open the markets of its trade partners does not 
exclude trade retaliation, it is hardly convincing to the 
international community. In addition, one cannot help but point 
out that the GATT has a tendency of attaching more importance to 
results in free trade than on principles and procedures for 
expanding free trade since it is based on principles of 
pragmatism. 
  We should, in particular, take notice of the clear fact 
that, 
although the United States denies it, the Super 301 clause 
targets certain countries. While the United States seems to 
consider Japan as its main target, the ROK is not exempt from 
being a target, either.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 29 March 
carry editorials on ROK President Kim Yong-sam's meeting with 
PRC President Jiang Zemin regarding the North Korean nuclear 
issue. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "A Pledge of Dialogue and Cooperation." 
Noting the significance of the ROK-PRC summit talks to discuss 
the North Korean nuclear issue, as well as economic cooperation 
between the two countries, the report says it is considered 
desirable that the two leaders of the ROK and PRC have agreed to 
support denuclearization on the Korean peninsula and to work 
together for the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Referring to their agreement to resolve the North Korean 
nuclear issue by urging North Korea to accept additional nuclear 
inspection by a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] based on a statement issued by the president of the UN 
Security Council rather than a resolution, the report says, 
"this is consistent with the position and principle of the 
Chinese Government in dealing with the Korean peninsula issue or 
the North Korean nuclear issue." 
  Noting President Jiang Zemin's remarks calling for the 
settlement of the North Korean nuclear issue peacefully through 
dialogues between the United States and North Korea, between the 
North and South, and between North Korea and the IAEA, the 
report says, "it is possible that President Jiang Zemin's 
remarks may cause the North Korean nuclear issue to remain 
unsettled, considering the fact that the suspicion of the 
nuclear issue cannot be dispelled unless North Korea accepts the 
additional nuclear inspections within six weeks." 
  Referring to the need for China's active participation in 
resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, the report says that 
it is important to settle the North Korean nuclear issue in 
order to promote economic cooperation and exchange of cultures 
between the two countries. 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 an 
800-word 
editorial entitled "The Cooperation by the Two Leaders of the 
ROK and PRC Regarding the North Korean Nuclear Issue." 
  Referring to the agreement to jointly make efforts to 
denuclearize the Korean peninsula and to the importance of the 
ROK- PRC summit talks in resolving the North Korean nuclear 
issue, the report says: "It is very significant that the ROK and 
the PRC have the same opinion that peace and security on the 
Korean peninsula are very important in achieving prosperity in 
the Northeast Asia." 
  Noting a pledge of security on the Korean peninsula made 
during the ROK-PRC summit talks, the report says, "in other 
words, this is China's pledge indicating that it will never 
forgive any threat posed to peace and security on the Korean 
peninsula. This can be regarded as the most powerful wedge to 
prevent North Korea from invading South Korea." 
  The report concludes that President Kim Yong-sam's ongoing 
visit to China serves as a firm foundation for the development 
of ROK-PRC relations.

  [Text] Seoul, March 29 (YONHAP) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam's Japan-China tour has put the brakes on the North 
Korean nuclear engine that was speeding toward UN sanctions. 
  In Japan, Kim and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa noted the 
importance of internationally coordinated efforts to solve the 
nuclear problem, especially among South Korea, Japan, China and 
the United States. 
  While the two leaders did not rule out the possibility of UN 
sanctions, they agreed that the channel for dialogue should be 
left open. 
  In China, President Jiang Zemin's downright opposition to 
sanctions turned the process completely around in the direction 
of negotiations. 
  The crisis over North Korea was reaching a new peak and the 
voices of hard-liners in South Korea and its allies were getting 
louder before Kim embarked on his trip, especially after 
Pyongyang threatened war by turning Seoul into a "sea of fire." 
  The UN Security Council hastily convened to discuss adopting 
a resolution, setting a deadline for North Korea to accept 
nuclear inspections. 
  But after Kim's trip, the emphasis is on giving Pyongyang 
one 
more chance. Developments here coincide with a turnaround at 
the Security Council, which now plans to issue a statement in 
the council president's name instead of adopting a resolution. 
  Officials in Seoul indicated they are willing to go along 
with the Chinese proposal to ensure Beijing takes part in 
international action. 
  The participation of China, about the only remaining North 
Korean ally, is the single most important element in persuading 
Pyongyang that it can no longer count on Beijing's support and 
in guaranteeing the effectiveness of sanctions. 
  Japanese and Chinese concerns became clear during Kim's 
visit 
-- their fear of armed conflict on the Korean peninsula which 
would put their own national security and economies at stake. 
Jiang went as far as saying that peace in the region is a 
prerequisite to China's continued economic growth. 
  Seoul's and Washington's choice is now to wait a little 
longer rather than risk China's opposition in case a resolution 
is put to a council vote. 
  Behind this choice is the calculation that if North Korea 
continues to refuse inspections, Beijing will then lose all 
justification in demanding further negotiations. 
  South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu leaves for 
Washington directly from Beijing to brief U.S. officials on the 
results of the Japan and China summits. 
  He will apparently convey China's insistence on additional 
diplomatic efforts and discuss how to get North Korea to come 
back to the negotiating table. 
  Hans Blix, director-general of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), said his inspection team has to re-enter 
North Korea within six weeks. 
  Seoul and Washington, in their attempts at dialogue with 
Pyongyang, are expected to withhold a decision on staging their 
joint military maneuvers "Team Spirit" until after the six weeks 
is up. 
  Now that the international mood is tipping toward further 
dialogue with North Korea, it is Pyongyang's turn to respond.

  [Editorial Report] ROK vernacular newspapers on 29 March 
carry editorials and articles on ROK Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu's "hasty" support for the PRC proposal that the UN 
Security Council president issue a statement on the North Korean 
nuclear issue instead of a resolution. 
  The moderate CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "Diplomatic Authorities Should Watch Their 
Words." While positively recognizing the significance of 
China's new proposal, the editorial says it is "strategically 
and technically" inappropriate for ROK diplomats to say "yes" so 
promptly. 
  The editorial questions if Minister Han had sufficient 
discussion with security-related ministers regarding this issue, 
and even if he had, the editorial says before conveying 
acceptance, the ROK should have persistently asked China what it 
will do when sanctions on North Korea become inevitable even 
after a UN Security Council president's statement. 
  The editorial also mentions the possibility of having China 
accept more of ROK's position on economic cooperation since the 
ROK accepted China's opinion on the nuclear issue. 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "Even Though A Cooperation System on the 
North Korean Nuclear Issue Is Established." The editorial 
criticizes that "China is using the North Korean nuclear issue 
to obtain better conditions in its negotiations on human rights 
and most-favored- nation status with the United States, and 
economic cooperation with the ROK." 
  Noting that the United States, United Kingdom, France, and 
Russia have exerted their own efforts to resolve the nuclear 
issue, the editorial defines Minister Han's support without 
consultation with allies as a "hasty" decision. 
  The editorial further stresses that if a statement is to be 
adopted, it should strongly urge North Korea to accept 
additional inspection, resume North-South dialogue, and provide 
a fixed deadline. 
  HANGUK ILBO also publishes on page 5 a 1,000-word article 
dispatched from UN headquarters by correspondent Kim Su-chong. 
The article observes that 15 member states of the UN Security 
Council are inclined to agree to China's proposal and that the 
United States would have no reason to insist on a resolution 
when the ROK supports the new proposal. 
  The article then details the points to which China disagreed 
from the draft resolution and its proposal of "a positive, 
objective, and moderate expression." 
  The article reports that interests will be focused on 
China's 
role after the statement is adopted. Recalling that China said 
it was not in a position to exercise influence on North Korea 
last year, the article analyzes that China has changed its 
attitude by telling the ROK permanent representative to the 
United Nations that "China is exerting its efforts needed in the 
situation" .

  [Text] Seoul, March 26 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe-chang received Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev on 
Saturday morning and discussed North Korean nuclear problem and 
situation on the Korean peninsula and northeast Asia. 
  Yi said that reform policy by former Soviet Union exerted a 
great influence on world countries including many East European 
countries. 
  "But it is regrettable to see that North Korea does not show 
any sign of change," he said. 
  Gorbachev said that he knows very well South Korea is making 
efforts in resolving the problem on the Korean peninsula and 
expected that North Korea will change after all as the entire 
world is changing. 
  Gorbachev came here Friday at the invitation of the 
Federation for World Peace, an academic organization established 
by the Rev. Mun Son-myong, founder of the Unification Church.

  [Text] Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev ruled out 
the possibility of the North Korean nuclear issue being 
"resolved by military means or dramatically settled in a short 
time." 
  "The international community will have to resort to peaceful 
and political means to resolve the North Korean nuclear row," 
said Gorbachev in a press conference in Seoul. 
  He came here to take part in the 2nd World Peace Conference, 
sponsored by the World Peace Foundation and the Segye Times, 
both affiliated with the Rev. Mun Son-myong's Unification Church. 
  "There is almost no possibility of the current crisis 
leading 
to an armed conflict. Things will get better as time goes by." 
said Gorbachev. 
  "However, the world shouldn't tolerate any country moving to 
break international treaties and violating the Nuclear Non- 
Proliferation Treaty," he said. 
  Meanwhile, Gorbachev, recalling his times as president of 
the 
now-defunct Soviet Union, denounced the West, particularly the 
United States, for "talking much about nuclear arms reduction 
without taking no practical actions." 
  "I took the initiative to dramatically reduce nuclear 
weapons 
and erase them from the Earth by the year 2000. But the West 
didn't heed my call. They thought my proposal went against 
their national interests," Gorbachev said. 
  He added that the West seemed to have regarded his 
initiative 
as "propaganda from a communist country or a naive approach." 
  Gorbachev warned against "ideologies being linked to 
political affairs" and the international community should seek a 
peaceful resolution to armed conflicts by fully taking into 
account each country's diverse situations. 
  When asked whether he has any channel of contact with North 
Korea, Gorbachev said "I don't have any. I am not a political 
figure now but a social worker." 
  "Russia has paid attention to Asian countries including 
Japan, China and South and North Korea. The attention has been 
increasing since the collapse of the Soviet Union," he said. 
  Gorbachev is president of the International Foundation for 
Socio- Economic and Political Studies, better known as the 
Gorbachev Foundation. He flew into Seoul with his wife Raisa 
Friday after wrapping up a six-day visit to Taiwan.

  [Text] Seoul, March 28 (YONHAP) -- Former Soviet President 
Mikhail Gorbachev predicted Monday that North Korea would have 
to change amid the current of reform that is sweeping the world. 
  "All kinds of reform that are taking place internationally 
will ultimately affect North Korea," Gorbachev told the speaker 
of the National Assembly, Yi Man-sop. 
  "When we reflect on the experience of German unification, we 
cannot doubt that Korea will eventually be unified one day," 
said Gorbachev during a courtesy call on Yi. 
  Gorbachev, accompanied by his wife, arrived in Seoul last 
Friday to attend the second world peace conference, which is 
sponsored by the Washington-based World Peace Federation, an 
affiliate of the Rev. Mun Son-myong's Unification Church. 
  "Germany is experiencing difficulties because it has 
achieved 
unification in a hurry," Gorbachev said. "Korea should proceed 
with its unification projects, taking its time so that there 
would not be such adverse side-effects." 
  Earlier Sunday evening, Former President No Tae-u hosted a 
dinner for Gorbachev. 
  No and Gorbachev agreed that although they have both retired 
from active politics, they will work to promote friendly ties 
between South Korea and Russia. 
  Gorbachev is scheduled to attend the world peace conference 
until Tuesday and meet with South Korean Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe-chang before leaving Seoul Thursday.

  [Text] Seoul, March 26 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Russia 
opened a working-level meeting here Saturday [26 March] to 
discuss how Moscow can repay South Korean loans. 
  At the meeting, expected to last until Tuesday, South Korea 
wants to confirm that Russia will assume responsibility for 
repaying economic cooperation loans that Seoul extended to the 
former Soviet Union, according to government officials. 
  South Korea will also press Russia to repay arrears on the 
loans totaling 390 million U.S. dollars outstanding at the end 
of last year, the officials said. 
  Rough sailing is expected at the meeting, however, as Moscow 
is likely to request a further delay in making payments, they 
said. 
  South Korea agreed to extend 3 billion dollars in economic 
cooperation loans to the former Soviet Union in 1990. Of that 
amount, it offered 1.47 billion dollars including 470 million 
dollars in tied loans. 
  Russia paid back only 17 million dollars in cash and another 
13 million dollars in aluminum ingots in 1992. Since then, 
Moscow has kept postponing any payment on interest or principle, 
the officials said. 
  The Russian delegation to the meeting, led by Vice External 
Economy Minister M.E. Fradkov, planned to confirm Russia's 
responsibility for the loans while asking for a grace period 
similar to that given by the Paris Club of creditors. 
  The Paris Club, comprised of 19 Western creditor nations, 
agreed last April to extend a grace period requiring Russia to 
pay back by September 1993 some 50 percent of arrears and 
principal of their loans outstanding at the end of 1992. Russia 
is to pay back the rest over five years with a two-year grace 
period. 
  The Seoul government, taking into consideration Russia's 
economic difficulties, is studying a plan under which Moscow 
could make payments in commodities and in the form of a lease on 
land on which South Korea is building a trade center, the 
officials said. 
  The trade center, being pushed by the Korea Foreign Trade 
Association, is to be built on a 2.5-hectare plot near Moscow 
University and Russia is asking a lease of 50 million dollars a 
year, they said.

<F P=106> [By Cynthia D. Balana and Lynda T. Jumilla] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo yesterday 
described as "inappropriate" and "unproductive" the United 
States decision to send 160 Patriot air defense missiles to 
South Korea, saying the arms buildup against communist North 
Korea could lead to "miscalculation" and war. 
  Sharing Romulo's apprehensions, Sen. Blas F. Ople warned the 
Philippines may again be drawn into a full-scale conflict in the 
peninsula as in the 1950-53 Korean War. 
  Sen. Rodolfo Biazon, however, called on the Philippines and 
other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to 
avoid knee-jerk reactions and "carefully measure their responses 
to developments in the Korean peninsula." 
  Tensions on the peninsula are high over North Korea's 
suspected nuclear weapons program. Nearly 2 million troops on 
both Koreas have been placed on a heightened alert. 
  The situation sharply deteriorated last weekend after 
Pyongyang barred UN experts from inspecting sites where North 
Korea is believed to be developing nuclear weapons. 
  While seeking UN sanctions against Pyongyang, the United 
States decided to ship Patriot missiles, more troops and 
additional arms to South Korea. Washington also planned to 
revive "Team Spirit" military exercises with Seoul. 
  North Korea has declared these U.S. measures, if pushed 
ahead, would be taken as a declaration of war. 
  "I continue to be worried about the Korean situation," 
Romulo 
told a press briefing. "All parties must be deliberate in 
action and not consider the international isolation of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea." 
  He said the United States approach was "inappropriate, 
unproductive and may even cause disequilibrium in the 
Asia-Pacific region." 
  Romulo's statements represented a rare instance when Manila 
openly refused to toe the U.S. line. 
  He said Washington seemed "unmindful" of the repercussions 
of 
its action on ASEAN members, including the Philippines, should 
the heightened tension on the Korean peninsula lead to war. 
  Like Washington, Manila only has diplomatic relations with 
Seoul but not with Pyongyang, an isolated, Stalinist state. 
  Still, Romulo said, it would be more productive if North 
Korea were encouraged to join the international community of 
nations. 
  Romulo said he has ordered Philippine Ambassador to South 
Korea Francisco Benedicto to draw up a contingency plan for some 
20,000 Filipino workers there should war break out. 
  At the Senate, Ople said he expects the Philippines to be 
"under pressure" to support any UN-led military action against 
Pyongyang. 
  During the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, Manila sided 
with Seoul and sent the Philippine Expeditionary Force to Korea 
upon the "request" of the U.S.-dominated United Nations. 
President Ramos, then a lieutenant, was part of the Philippine 
military contingent. 
  "If there's going to be war between the United Nations and 
North Korea, I would expect the Philippines to be put under 
pressure to send troops," said Ople, chair of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
  He said the imposition of UN economic sanctions would force 
Pyongyang to resort to war. 
  Ople called on Manila to lead the ASEAN in an "intensified 
peace diplomacy" to defuse the tension in the Korean peninsula. 
  But Biazon said the Philippines may not necessarily be 
compelled to send a military contingent should a Korean war 
erupt anew. 
  "Not one nation can be compelled to do so because sending 
troops is a function also of its capability to bankroll, equip, 
and staff such a force," he said. 
  Biazon called on Pacific rim nations, particularly ASEAN 
members, to "carefully measure their responses to the 
developments in the Korean peninsula." 
  "This is just the classic military situation of buildup on 
the frontlines and there may not be cause for alarm at the 
moment," he said. 
  Biazon said that conditions are no longer the same as in the 
1950s because the Cold War is over and countries in the region 
are more concerned about economic progress. 
  But should tensions degenerate into a military 
confrontation, 
"then let it be confined to the peninsula," he said.

  [Text] The Philippines yesterday lifted a key restriction 
to trade with Vietnam, ahead of President Ramos' official visit 
to Hanoi next week, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) 
said. 
  "In response to Vietnam's shift towards a market economy," 
Hanoi was being delisted from the list of socialist and other 
centrally planned economy countries in which bilateral trade is 
regulated by the official Philippine International Trading Corp. 
(PITC), DTI Secretary Rizalino Navarro said. 
  Mr. Ramos, along with a small official party of government 
officials and a group of businessmen, are scheduled to visit 
Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City on 28 to 30 March in an attempt to 
develop and expand bilateral economic ties. 
  Total two-way trade was $17.4 million in the first half of 
1993 with the Philippines enjoying an $11.93 million surplus. 
  The delisting and the planned presidential visit came after 
the United States lifted an economic embargo against Vietnam. 
  Philippine traders must still secure approval from the PITC 
before they can export to, or import from, Albania, Angola, 
Burma, China, Ethiopia, Laos, Libya, Mongolia, Mozambique, 
Nicaragua, and North Korea. 
  Manila has already identified science research and 
environmental protection as two possible areas in which the 
Philippines and Vietnam could work out a cooperative deal. 
  The two countries will implement a bilateral agreement on 
these areas only after consulting all the other countries with 
claims to the disputed island chain in the South China Sea. 
  Briefing reporters on the president's visit, acting Foreign 
Secretary Rodolfo Severino said the cooperative arrangements 
being explored by Manila with Hanoi is part of 
confidence-building measures to prevent armed conflict in the 
disputed territories. 
  Severino said the visit is also part of efforts of the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations to speed up the 
integration of Vietnam into the ASEAN community. 
  In Palawan, Mr. Ramos said his trip to Vietnam would be the 
first step in reaching a common position in jointly exploring 
and exploiting untapped mineral, oil, and other resources in the 
South China Sea. Hanoi had entered into a similar cooperative 
agreement with Kuala Lumpur. But the agreements cannot be 
implemented without approval from other claimant countries. 
  Apart from Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines, other 
countries claiming about a hundred islands atolls and reefs in 
the South China Sea very near Palawan are China, Taiwan, and 
Brunei.

  [Text] The provision of the Uruguay Round to which the 
Philippines committed, to convert quantitative restrictions on 
agricultural products into tariffs does not amend Republic Act 
No. 7606, known as the Magna Carta of Small Farmers. 
  This was the ruling made by Justice Secretary Franklin M. 
Drilon in reply to a query of Trade and Industry Secretary 
Rizalino S. Navarro. Drilon said "the Magna Carta provisions 
cannot be amended by the Final Act of the Uruguay Round." 
  While the Philippines adopts the generally accepted 
principles of international law as part of the law of the land 
in consonance with the Constitution, Drilon said, it has been 
said that a municipal law which is in conflict with a rule of 
international law will often be given effect in municipal courts 
since the latter are organs of municipal law and are bound by it. 
  Citing the Salonga-Yap book on Public International Law, 
Drilon said, the fact that international law has been made part 
of the law of the land does not by any means imply the primacy 
of international law over national or municipal law in the 
municipal sphere. 
  As retired Supreme Court Justice Edgardo J. Paras said in 
his 
work "International Law," in case of conflict between 
international law and the municipal law of the tribunal deciding 
the case, the municipal law shall prevail. 
  However, Drilon said, if the Final Act of the Uruguay Round 
is subjected to the Senate ratification pursuant to the 
Constitution, "our reply to this particular query might be 
different if we are to consider and apply the American 
jurisprudential rule that a treaty may supersede a prior act of 
Congress in the same manner that an act of Congress may 
supersede a prior treaty." 
  Navarro also asked whether "non-implementation by the 
president or the secretary of agriculture of the trade provision 
of the Magna Carta hold them liable for action by interest 
groups."

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] A newly formed bloc of the Communist Party of the 
Philippines (CPP) yesterday unveiled a program that rejects the 
leading role of communists in the insurgent war against the 
government, the CHRONICLE has learned. 
  The group, which broke from the Maoist-oriented CPP, has 
been 
holding a series of preparatory meetings for the formal 
launching of "Siglaya [Siglo ng Paglaya -- Century of 
Independence]" in the middle of May, according to a leader of 
the group who spoke to the CHRONICLE. 
  As agreed upon by the preparatory committee, the group shall 
be an "open and legal organization." 
  The committee for the founding congress in May includes 
civic 
leaders Liddy Nacpil-Alejandro, Ben Moraleda, Etta Rosales, Noel 
Medina, peasant leader Jaime Tadeo, labor leader Robert Galvez 
who represents the Ilaw at Buklod ng Manggagawa [Ilaw -- 
expansion unknown; and Workers Union], and scholar Joel Rocamora. 
  Ricardo Reyes, whom the military has identified as the 
former 
secretary general of the CPP, is one of the leaders group 
principally assigned to draft the program. 
  The Siglaya leader also said a top-ranking Catholic 
religious 
leader has joined them but he requested the CHRONICLE not to 
publish his name. 
  In a 15-page manifesto, the group lined up a 10-point 
program 
that one of its leaders said sets it apart from the mainstream 
CPP and a breakaway group of some Metro Manila-based cadres and 
members. 
  Among its goals are: 
  -- Aspire for national independence from imperialist control 
and uphold the sovereign control over the country's national 
life, politics, and culture. 
  -- Work to end the political control of "imperialists and 
big 
landlords and bureaucrat capitalists." 
  -- Establish a people's democratic state, uphold democratic 
rights, civil liberties, human rights and other social rights 
like the right to strike. It shall uphold the rights of the 
minorities. 
  -- Work to make capital for agriculture available to 
peasants, push for rural cooperatives, work to modernize 
agriculture, and to ensure food security. 
  -- Work for a comprehensive and progressive policy for 
social 
welfare. 
  -- Uphold a culture that stresses patriotism, national 
unity, 
scientific and critical attitude, democratic ethics; respect for 
the gender, religion and beliefs, race and color, and other free 
thinking; a patriotic, scientific, critical, and liberating 
education for the Filipino youth. 
  -- Uphold the rights of the Bangsa Moro people, people of 
Cordillera at the national minorities for self-determination. 
  -- Oppose the destruction of the environment, defense of the 
source of life, democratization in the exploitation of natural 
resources. 
  -- Work for the equality of the sexes and the freedom of 
women from a patriarchal system. 
  -- Adopt an independent foreign policy. Establish diplomatic 
relations with all countries regardless of ideology and social 
system. 
  Rejecting the vanguard role of the CPP in the insurgency, 
Siglaya said it shall uphold empowerment in its political work. 
  Empowerment, Siglaya said, "is not only an aspiration as a 
platform for change. According to the group, this principle 
will start today, in spirit, in our ethics, in every process and 
conduct, in the whole political and organization life of the 
newly born movement." 
  According to the Siglaya leader, the new movement will rely 
on several organizations for its mass base and shall not dictate 
upon these organizations. 
  He said the new movement shall not take a confrontational 
attitude towards the party led by Jose Ma. Sison. "Instead, we 
shall let the masses decide which is the more viable political 
program," the leader said. 
  Asked about the group of Metro Manila-based communists who 
broke from Sison, the Siglaya leader said the Metro group led by 
one Carlos Forte has yet to come up with a program. 
  "We hope the group finishes its draft so that the people can 
decide on what program is the best," he said. Although Forte's 
group has openly criticized Sison, it has yet to come up with 
its program. 
  Asked to elaborate on its differences with the Sison group, 
the Siglaya leader said he could identify at least three areas 
where the new group differs with Sison. 
  One of these, he said, was on the ideological framework. He 
said that while Sison has adopted the Maoist framework, the new 
group draws its inspiration from the writings on early Marx. 
  He explained that the early Marx was a humane Marx who 
stressed the need to uphold the rights and prerogatives of the 
individual. 
  On the other hand, he said, the Program of the People's 
Democratic Revolution adopted by Sison's CPP puts premium on the 
rights of the state and the party over the individual. 
  On the method of grabbing power, the new group will utilize 
all forms of struggle including elections, lobbying, and mass 
mobilizations. "We are also open to armed struggle, but it 
shall be on a case-to-case basis," said the Siglaya leader. 
  Sison's group, on the other hand, has a very clear stand on 
the seizure of state power, and that is to destroy by armed 
means the machinery of the state and installing a national 
democratic state. 
  The Siglaya leader, however, said the new movement agrees 
with Sison on the need to install a "national democratic state" 
as a transition to a socialist goal.

  [Begin Ruiz recording] President Ramos ordered government 
bureaucrats to cut red tape to move the peace process faster, 
following his decision to grant amnesty to all rebels and 
insurgents. The president said that administrative problems 
such as delayed release of funds and tedious paper work should 
not be allowed to slow down the peace process and other vital 
work of the government. The president directed Executive 
Secretary Teofisto Guingona to make every bureaucrat move 
faster. He also directed Guingona and Budget Secretary Salvador 
Enriquez to solve the problem immediately. The president was 
peeved by a complaint by former Ambassador Manuel Yan, 
presidential adviser on the peace process, that although the 
budget has been appropriated, there has been smothering in the 
release of the funds. [end recording]

  [Text] WASHINGTON'S proposal to open bids for its textile 
quotas may be blocked by the regulations of the Multi-Fibre 
Arrangement (MFA), a global textile-trade agreement. Currently 
the quotas imposed under the MFA are managed by exporting 
countries so that any financial gains -- what economists call 
"quota rent"-- are retained in the exporting countries. 
  In Thailand, the Commerce Ministry is responsible for 
allocating textile export quotas, and some of these are traded 
among Thai exporters. According to experts who have examined 
the US proposal to open bids for allocating textile quotas to 
importers, only exporting countries are eligible to sell quota 
rights. That would violate both MFA and GATT rules. 
  Washington announced the bidding in order to compensate for 
the US$13.9 billion loss of revenue expected in the next five 
years resulting from tariff cuts under the Uruguay Round of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the cuts would 
benefit Americans since they would reduce prices. The 
government's income would rise $3 for each dollar lost from 
tariff cuts. 
  In another development, the Thai Commercial Counsellor in 
Washington said that the US Senate had enacted the Fair Trade in 
Financial Services bill, which will increase US leaders' 
authority in trade negotiations on financial market access for 
commercial banks, insurance firms and other financial 
institutions. 
  The act allows the US Treasury to list countries that refuse 
to open financial markets to American companies.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Calls for Reform and Democratization of UN" </F>
-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
calls on the non-aligned countries to invigorate the efforts for 
the reform and democratization of the United Nations. 
  In a by-lined article calling for further increasing the 
might of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), the paper says: 
  This movement must fully play the role of a leading force in 
building a new world where all the countries and nations would 
exercise independent rights in the international arena on an 
equal footing. 
  What is important in this is to activate the work for the 
reform and democratization of the United Nations so that the 
non-aligned nations can take part in the solution of 
international issues with equal responsibility and rights. Only 
when the United Nations is democratized is it possible to do 
away with arbitrariness and privilege in the United Nations and 
ensure equality, allow its member nations to lift up their 
voices of justice and solve international issues in a fair way. 
  The non-aligned nations must work out a common strategy for 
the reform of the United Nations, take a joint action and make 
concerted efforts to put an end to pressure, sanctions and 
interference in other's internal affairs based on the abuse of 
the authority of the United Nations. If the NAM is to be kept 
pure, any attempt to open its door without consideration must 
never be allowed, the paper says, and goes on: 
  Whether a country can be a member nation of the NAM or join 
it with any other qualification depends on whether it pursues a 
policy according with the basic idea and principle of the NAM or 
aspires after and sympathizes with it. 
  The non-aligned nations must take a joint action for a total 
elimination of the nuclear weapons in the world and the removal 
of the inequality of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.

<F P=106> ["Might of NAM Must Be Increased"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- Further increasing the 
might of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) at present remains an 
important matter since the idea of the movement has not yet been 
materialized with the people's cause of independence being 
hindered by the moves of the imperialists and their followers, 
says NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article today. 
  What is important in increasing the might of the NAM is to 
maintain the fundamental principles and idea of this movement, 
the paper notes, and stresses: 
  To regard independence against imperialism as its idea, stay 
outside all blocs and pursue an independent policy is the 
fundamental principles of the NAM. 
  Only when the NAM adheres to the fundamental principles, the 
source of its viability, can it further enhance its might and 
role and successfully realise the noble idea of independence 
against imperialism. 
  It is also important in increasing the might of the NAM to 
keep the movement pure and cement its unity. 
  Any attempt to open its door in an unprincipled manner must 
not be allowed. Whether a country can be a member nation of the 
NAM or join it with any other qualification depends on whether 
it pursues a policy according with the basic idea and principle 
of the NAM or aspires after and sympathizes with it. 
  If the non-aligned nations unite with each other closely on 
the basis of independence and wage a common struggle, they can 
check and frustrate the moves of the dominationist forces and 
carry into effect the idea of the NAM. 
  Now the NAM is faced with tasks to struggle to achieve 
democracy and independence of the whole world, reject the policy 
of strength and arbitrariness of the dominationist forces and 
establish a new international political and economic order on 
the basis of equality, justice and impartiality. 
  What is important in this is to activate the work for the 
reform and democratization of the United Nations so that the 
non-aligned nations can take part in the solution of 
international issues with equal responsibility and rights. The 
non-aligned nations must work out a common strategy for the 
reform of the United Nations, take a joint action and make 
concerted efforts to put an end to pressure, sanctions and 
interference in other's internal affairs based on the abuse of 
the authority of the United Nations. It is one of the main 
duties of the NAM to oppose all manner of domination and 
subjugation, aggression and interference, achieve disarmament 
and safeguard the world peace and security. 
  The non-aligned nations must reject any attempt seeking a 
political purpose in a military way and actively struggle to 
resolve all the disputes on the principle of mutual respect and 
non-interference in other's internal affairs. 
  They must make strenuous efforts to free themselves from the 
economic yoke of the imperialists and establish a new 
international economic order on the basis of independence, 
equality and impartiality by establishing a South-South economic 
order on the principle of collective self-reliance. 
  The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
and the Korean people will, as in the past, so in the future, 
too, steadfastly defend the basic idea and purpose of the NAM, 
remain faithful to it and make every possible effort to enhance 
its role.

  [Text] President Suharto Monday criticized the West 
developed countries which set democracy as one of conditions to 
extend development cooperation with the developing countries. 
  "The developed countries are raising democracy issue and 
good 
government as the integral part of development process, mainly 
in the developing countries," Suharto said opening the 
leadership meeting of the Foreign Affairs Ministry here on 
Monday. 
  Suharto stressed there is no a single form of democracy 
which 
could be applied universally. "Democracy is not a static 
concept which is limited on the standard forms and practices 
although it has universal principles and aspects," Suharto said. 
  Suharto said that cultural values and historical experience 
of every nation are very variable. 
  If every nation is demanded to apply the basic principle of 
democracy by ignoring the values in inter-nations relationship, 
this would really deny the basic principle of democracy, Suharto 
sald. 
  Suharto argued that democracy and democratisation are 
dynamic 
process which is harmony with fundamental values of every nation 
and it is necessary to be adjusted with the developing reality 
[sentence as published]. 
  "Therefore, democratisation remains relevant with national 
life," Suharto said. 
  Suharto said that in a such dynamic world, Indonesia and 
other developing nations are implementing their respective 
national development. 
  "There is no a single nation that could be developed from 
outside," Suharto stressed. 
  Therefore, the president added the development of the 
developing nations must be based on principle of national 
self-reliance. 
  "However, we are aware that with all fund and capability 
deployed by the developing nations for their development, it 
would be difficult to achieve a success if international 
environment is not conducive. 
  Suharto believes that the advanced and developing countries 
need to reach a new agreement since almost all international 
issues are interrelated and have global impacts. 
  "It is time for the North and South to create a new 
consensus 
on the international development and establish democratic 
partnership, especially in dealing with global issues," the 
president stated. 
  Only this way all nations in the world can reorganize the 
international economic order to make it fairer and more reliable. 
  On the changing world, he said no country can isolate itself 
from the prevailing change. 
  Therefore, every nation must improve its capability of 
understanding the change and adjust itself to the situation, he 
added. 
  "Adjusting ourselves does not mean that we have to follow 
whereever the wind blows, but we have to strengthen the positive 
elements to boost peace and welfare, and on the other hand we 
have to try our best to avoid the negative elements," the 
president explained. 
  He said the world is now still far from being peaceful, 
safe, 
and prosperous despite the end of the Cold War. 
  Meanwhile, Minister Alatas reported that the meeting lasting 
until March 26 is attended by 78 ambassadors and representative 
heads, 20 consul generals, five consuls, an ambassador-at-large, 
and some senior officials of the foreign ministry. 
  The Foreign Ministry holds its working meeting every five 
years. Among those attending the opening ceremony of five 
meeting were Coordinating Minister for Political and Security 
Susilo Sudarman and former foreign minister Sunario.

  [Text] RAROTONGA, March 24 (AFP) -- The ruling Cook 
Islands Party (CIP) won general elections in the South Pacific 
tax haven Thursday, after a bruising campaign marked by 
allegations of fiscal fraud and wild spending on an 
Italian-funded hotel project. With 21 of the 25 seats declared 
in the Legislative Assembly, CIP, led by Prime Minister Sir 
Geoffrey Henry, held 16, a decline of one compared with the 
outgoing parliament, while the Democratic Party had three seats 
and the Alliance two. 
  The Cooks is one of the world's smallest nations, with 
18,500 
people spread over one of the largest sea areas in the world. 
The election was coloured by claims in the New Zealand 
parliament that the Cook Island's status as a tax haven had been 
abused, to defraud taxpayers and banks internationally. 
  The allegations, strongly denied, were made by New Zealand 
MP 
Winston Peters, who also charged that some Cooks politicians had 
received money in secret bank accounts "to encourage (them)...to 
sell their sovereignty". A hundred million dollars had been 
defrauded, he said. 
  For the first time the Cooks had a television station to air 
the claims and counter-claims, giving the election an air of 
tension. However veteran local observers said this election was 
just child's play compared with polls of the 1970s when CIP 
founder Albert Henry, an uncle of Geoffrey, used money from a US 
millionaire who had the Cooks' stamp printing franchise, to fly 
in voters from New Zealand to stuff ballot boxes. Henry won 
several doubtful elections but was eventually ejected from 
office in 1978 when found guilty of corruption. 
  Democratic Party leader Sir Tom Davis, a former doctor with 
the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), 
took over until 1983 when Geoffrey Henry came to power. Henry, 
53, has stamped his personal style on the Cook Islands, and 
pushed ahead with developing the country's tourist industry with 
a major airport and building a hotel under the Sheraton badge on 
Rarotonga, the archipelago's main island. The project has been 
sharply criticised for gigantic cost overruns and changes of 
management, as well as a possibly destructive effect on the 
local environment, threatening a beautiful lagoon. 
  Elections in the Cooks are for a term of five years, 
conducted on a first past the post basis. Running with the 
elections were referenda on the length of parliamentary office, 
whether the country should have a native Maori name, which flag 
to fly and which national anthem to play.

March] unveiled a new package of measures to further open its 
markets to foreign products, in a bid to cut huge trade 
surpluses and deflect criticism from trading partners, 
especially the United States. 
  The package, approved by the cabinet Tuesday morning, 
centers 
on tax cuts and other macroeconomic steps to spur domestic 
demand, market-opening measures in four sectors and voluntary 
overtures in three priority areas of the stalemated trade talks 
with the U.S. 
  Noting the need to overhaul Japan's economic structure, 
Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said in a statement that the new 
package clearly shows his administration's resolve to achieve 
such reform and bring the nation's economy into harmony with the 
international community. 
  Earlier Tuesday morning, Hosokawa telephoned to U.S. 
President Bill Clinton to explain the package in advance and 
seek U.S. understanding of Japan's efforts to increase foreign 
access to its markets. 
  Thanking Hosokawa for the call, Clinton said he looks 
forward 
to scrutinizing the package, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura told a news conference. 
  Clinton reportedly said he still believes Japan and the U.S. 
can reach an agreement in the so-called "framework" trade 
negotiations that collapsed at the bilateral summit in 
Washington on February 11. 
  Clinton was also quoted as telling Hosokawa that the two 
countries can gauge progress in the openness of Japanese markets 
by "objective criteria" while addressing Japan's concern that 
setting numerical targets would lead to managed trade. 
  The package has no fresh proposals on macroeconomic measures 
but promises to draw up concrete plans by the end of June for 
comprehensive tax reform, including permanent tax cuts and 
boosting the amount of the current 10-year, 430 trillion yen 
public works spending program that began in fiscal 1991. 
  With no new fiscal measures, the package features four 
market-opening items -- deregulation, promotion of imports and 
investment, enhancing competition, and boosting government 
procurement. 
  Deregulatory steps involve abolition of regulations that 
directly block foreign access, international coordination of 
licensing and inspections systems, and simpler application 
procedures. 
  The measures center on four areas -- housing and land, 
information and communications, distribution, and financial 
services and insurance. 
  Under these basic guidelines, the package pledges to devise 
concrete measures to either abolish or ease government 
regulations by the end of June. 
  Concerning measures to enhance competition, the package 
calls 
for stricter enforcement of the antimonopoly law, issuance of 
guidelines to bar bid-rigging, and the carrying out of surveys 
on business practices and price gaps between Japan and other 
countries. 
  Import and investment measures include the holding of 
seminars, trade fairs and other information-exchanging 
opportunities, action programs for fiscal 1994 to offer tax, 
financial and other incentives, and better use of the office of 
trade and investment ombudsman. 
  The package also includes Tokyo's voluntary actions to 
enhance foreign access in three priority areas identified in the 
framework talks with Washington -- automobile and auto parts, 
insurance, and government procurement of telecommunications and 
medical equipment. 
  Japan believes the announcement of its new package will lead 
to the resumption of the deadlocked trade negotiations sometime 
in the next three months in hope of reaching an accord at the 
annual summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized 
nations in Naples in July, Takemura said. 
  Tokyo is scheduled to issue a follow-up package before the 
G-7 summit that will offer more concrete plans for macroeconomic 
measures. 
  The package offers no specific targets for either cutting 
the 
trade surplus or for market access. But it spells out that a 
government economic forecast indicates the ratio of current 
account surplus to gross domestic product (GDP) will dwindle 
from 3.4 percent in fiscal 1992 to 3.1 percent in fiscal 1993 
ending Thursday, and to 2.8 percent in fiscal 1994. 
  Asked if this will be taken by the U.S. as a promise by 
Japan 
to whittle down its trade surplus to that level, Takemura 
replied, "we don't regard this as our international pledge." 
  The package also introduces and welcomes plans announced 
recently by the automobile industry and major automakers to 
increase purchases of U.S.-made parts to specific amounts.

  [Text] New York, March 28 (YONHAP) -- The United Nations 
Security Council held a closed-door meeting Monday but failed to 
make any decisions on resolving the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  China strongly opposed the adoption of a resolution tabled 
by 
the United States and demanded a statement in the name of the 
council president instead. 
  In addition, China requested that the statement be far 
milder 
in content than the draft resolution. 
  In view of this position, the United States, Britain, 
France, 
Russia and China held consultations after the plenary session to 
adjust their differences on the form and content of the 
council's future action. 
  The United States, Britain and France upheld their support 
for adoption of the resolution in principle, but might consent 
to the council president's statement as China demanded if it is 
similar to the draft resolution in content, a diplomatic source 
here said. 
  According to the source, China demanded that the fifth 
provision of the U.S.-drafted resolution -- "the UN Security 
Council will consider additional measures if necessary" -- be 
removed in the statement. 
  Chen Jian, deputy chief of the Chinese Mission to the United 
Nations, told reporters after the meeting that China favors the 
council president's statement which does not include any 
threatening terms. 
  A source here said the United States may concede to China in 
adopting the statement to ensure Beijing's participation in 
further UN steps on the North Korean issue. 
  Washington will likely compromise by referring to additional 
council measures in a roundabout way in the statement. 
  The Security Council plans to hold a permanent members' 
meeting and a closed-door plenary session on Tuesday to continue 
discussions on the form and content of measures. 
  Meanwhile, South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu may 
express his support for a statement by the council president 
rather than the U.S.-drafted resolution. 
  Han is scheduled to arrive at UN headquarters in New York on 
Thursday.

  [Text] In the midst of a threat from the United States to 
withdraw most favored nation (MFN) status from China, Foreign 
Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo yesterday said it would be 
unwise for Washington to use its MFN tool on Beijing now that 
the nuclear threat in the Korean peninsula continues to be 
alarming. Mr. Romulo pointed out that North Korea's relations 
with Beijing as its last remaining ally should be viewed with 
serious concern by the United States because "Beijing is a key 
player in maintaining equilibrium in this region." "We hope 
Washington would soon come to an understanding of what their 
position is vis-a-vis China," Mr. Romulo said, referring to the 
disconcerting dispute on Washington's move of linking the 
granting of MFN status to Beijing over alleged human rights 
abuses. "I understand and sympathize with their concerns on 
human rights abuses but I do not believe that they should use 
MFN as the big stick. In this particular instance, unless and 
until the Unites States comes to a resolution of what their 
policy is, I think the big stick approach is inappropriate 
because it might generate a certain level of instability in this 
otherwise unstable region. [sentence as published] And the only 
people who will suffer in this are people like us who are in 
this region. That's why we are asking the United States to look 
at their policy and come up with a responsible approach so that 
it does not generate disequilibrium in this part of the world," 
he said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Reforms at the UN Overdue"] </F>
  [Text] Only the severely myopic would contend that the 
United Nations, born out of the ashes of the Second World War, 
is serving all its 184 members effectively and satisfactorily 
and should therefore be left alone to conduct its business 
undisturbed. 
  There is no question that the world body is showing its age 
and urgent reforms have to be carried out to bring it more in 
tune with the current scenario and be more responsive to its 
members' aspirations. Indeed, it is a wonder that while nations 
are rising and falling, governments and societies are changing 
and history written and rewritten since its founding, an 
organization supposed to be at the forefront of these 
developments has been allowed to retain and be saddled by the 
relics of its past. 
  The first anomaly which might have served its purpose in the 
past but which should have been discarded once it outlived its 
usefulness and which has been found to be inimical to the 
interests of the majority of its members is the Security Council 
and the composition of its members. It is the heart of the 
organisation as it has been given powers far greater than the 
General Assembly to which all members belong. In matters 
involving world peace no action can be contemplated without the 
agreement of the Security Council. Its members of 15 countries 
literally can, and in many cases, have ignored the wishes of the 
majority in the General Assembly. 
  Of the 15, five are permanent members dating back to the day 
of its formation and 10 are rotating members elected every two 
years from the rest of 179 countries. As if that is not 
anomalous enough the permanent members have assigned to 
themselves the veto power. If just any one of them, acting on 
sectarian and narrow national interests, choose to exercise it, 
it could effectively frustrate and paralyse the organisation. 
This has happened so often in the past that in due course it 
has goaded many nations to press for reforms of the world body. 
  For this very reason Malaysia and many other reform-minded 
countries have targeted the Security Council. Our permanent 
representative has called for the restructuring of the council 
to bring equitable representation and ensure fairness to all 
nations which in turn should forge a new consensus on power and 
burden- sharing. The current over-representation -- seven 
members in the council from the Western and European group of 47 
countries and the remaining eight seats from the rest of 132 
countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America -- is unacceptable. 
  While the question of the equitable representation, which 
will mean an increase in the membership of the Security Council 
is important, equally important are issues pertaining to 
permanent members and the veto power they wield. Are these 
relevant at all and should not they be done away with for good 
in these days of democratic rights and equality? 
  By right, the proposed reforms to make the United Nations 
more democratic should be welcomed and readily accepted by 
nations which have otherwise appointed themselves champions and 
guardians of democracy but who seem to be singing a different 
tune when their narrow self-interests are being questioned. 
Malaysia and other reformers should not be discouraged by the 
opposition shown by the big powers and slacken their efforts. 
In time, an unreasonable stand, however stubborn, against what 
is right and just surely will be embarrassed into acceptance.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan-ROK Relationship Getting Onto Mature </F>
Track"] 
  [Text] South Korean President Kim Yong-sam has concluded 
his visit to Japan, and his visit must have left many people 
with the impression that the environment surrounding Japan-ROK 
relations has undergone a change. 
  This was the first visit to Japan as a state guest by a 
South 
Korean president in four years and the first time that the focus 
of summit talks has not dwelled on the two nations' past 
history. The mass media of both countries reported on the 
summit and on the emperor's remarks in a calm manner. 
  It is true that his visit took place at a time when the 
issue 
of DPRK (North Korean) suspected nuclear weapons development has 
become critical. However, it is believed that many Japanese and 
South Koreans have begun to basically share President Kim's 
view, which he expounded at the Imperial Palace banquet, that 
"the past should no longer be allowed to obstruct the future." 
  Nothing is more futile than to allow the past to damage 
present and future relations between Japan and the ROK. We want 
to relegate to history that unhappy period when anti-Japanese 
sentiment reared its ugly head in South Korea and Japan 
continually expressed its exasperation with the South Koreans. 
  Needless to say, the Japanese people should not forget the 
history and lessons connected with Japan's colonial rule of the 
Korean peninsula. In regard to the comfort women issue, South 
Korea has worked out its own relief measures without seeking 
compensation from Japan. Separately from these measures, it is 
now urgent for the Japanese Government to take actions to show 
its sincerity in tackling the issue. 
  President Kim's current visit marked the first step toward 
establishing a mature bilateral relationship. Now that it has 
gotten on the future-oriented track, efforts should be made to 
keep it on track. 
  On the basis of present and future interests, good relations 
between Japan and the ROK are essential in regard to the 
international situation. The two countries have many 
interconnecting roles to play to ensure stability and 
development in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world. North 
Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development program is a case 
in point in the immediate vicinity. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Kim agreed to 
support the international community's resolute actions to settle 
the issue while opening the door to dialogue with North Korea. 
They also agreed to further strengthen tripartite cooperation 
between Japan, South Korea, and the United States, while 
confirming the importance of China's role and seeking its 
cooperation. 
  The two leaders sent a signal to North Korea that they would 
seek a solution through dialogue by urging the North to accept 
the full inspection of its nuclear facilities and to promote a 
dialogue between the two Koreas. But depending on the North's 
response, they said they would endorse sanctions to be approved 
by the UN Security Council. 
  Because the issue poses a serious security problem for Japan 
and the ROK, this message is natural and reasonable. The UN 
Security Council has decided to take graduated actions in 
setting this issue. The Japanese coalition government--the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan in particular--should make 
efforts to tackle this issue with cohesion. 
  Reportedly, Prime Minister Hosokawa and President Kim 
discussed all possible scenarios and agreed on how they would 
react. However, it is necessary that the defense ministers of 
the two countries get together to have a thorough discussion on 
how to deal with the issue. 
  As President Kim told a news conference, it is apparent that 
China is opposed to North Korea's nuclear weapons development 
program. And, China will probably do its best to persuade the 
DPRK not to go nuclear because China might find itself in a 
difficult position when sanctions are discussed by the UN 
Security Council. China certainly understands the significance 
of President Kim's visit to Beijing in the footsteps of Prime 
Minister Hosokawa. 
  We agree with President Kim when he said that isolating 
North 
Korea is not the intention of the international community and 
that neither are sanctions. The international community just 
wants North Korea to behave as a responsible member. We must 
now keep a sharp eye on the DPRK.

  [Text] Hsu Shui-teh, secretary general of Taiwan's 
Kuomintang, delivered a speech at a Tokyo hotel on 24 March, and 
stated: "Taiwan has achieved its economic liberalization and 
made advances in its political democratization. Our future task 
is internationalization." Thus, he indicated Taiwan's strong 
intention to return to the international community through its 
admission into the GATT and the United Nations. 
  While stressing that Taiwan's economy is growing smoothly, 
Secretary General Hsu stated that it is also advancing in its 
political democratization under President Li Teng-hui's 
leadership. Then, while disclosing good prospects for "the 
direct presidential election by residents next year," Hsu 
added: "As a result, democratization will be fully realized." 
  Touching on the issue of Taiwan's UN admission, Hsu 
expressed 
his dissatisfaction, and said: "It is unfair that Taiwan's 
admission has not been approved while it has economic potential 
and also intends to fulfill its mission as a member state of the 
international community." Then, Secretary General Hsu, who is 
also former representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural 
Representative Office in Japan, called on Japan for its 
cooperation in supporting Taiwan's UN admission. 
  On the issue of reunification with China, Hsu pointed out: 
"While China's democratization is an indispensable factor, the 
economic disparity is still too big." "However," he added, 
"exchanges at the private level have been proceeding smoothly 
but in a cautious way." Thus, he disclosed Taiwan's intention 
to upgrade the level of dialogue to promote reunification. 
  Hsu also touched on Taiwan's achievements in the diplomatic 
field. For example, President Li Teng-hui paid unofficial 
visits to three ASEAN member nations last month with good 
results. Moreover, he also stated that "we want to be admitted 
into the GATT through our participation in the Asian Pacific 
Economic Cooperation [APEC] forum." Thus, he stressed that "the 
most important future task for Taiwan is its 
internationalization."

  [Excerpts] Due to engine trouble, a Cessna airplane 
belonging to the aeroclub at the U.S. military's Kadena Air Base 
[KAB] on Okinawa made an emergency landing in the car park at 
Blue Beach, Kin village at about 1010 on 26 March. The male 
pilot was not injured. According to U.S. Forces and Ishikawa 
Police Station sources, no cars or people were in the car park 
when the plane made its emergency landing, despite the fact it 
was Saturday. The airplane was not damaged. And, despite the 
fact any slight miscalculation in the maneuver could have caused 
disaster, the public relations office of the 18th Flight Wing at 
KAB did not file a report on the incident to the prefectural 
government until 1700 on 27 March and then provided no details. 
[passage omitted on details] The flight wing public relations 
office report said "it was the only possible measure that could 
have been taken," and "the pilot followed safety procedures." 
[passage providing further details omitted] 
  The U.S. military contacted Ishikawa Police Station by phone 
at about 1120. The pilot was alone at the site when police 
officers arrived. Soon, however, other members of the aeroclub 
and the U.S. military police arrived at the beach in a truck, 
dismantled the wings of the plane, loaded everything onto the 
truck, and took the plane back to KAB. Villagers at the beach 
for recreation watched the dismantling in wonder. 
  According to the 18th Flight Wing, its security office is 
currently carrying out an investigation into the cause of the 
accident. 
  When the OKINAWA TIMES made a telephone inquiry into the 
accident, the person at the aeroclub, to which the plane 
belongs, refused to answer, saying they "do not have any 
obligation to provide information." He repeatedly said: "You 
should direct any inquiries to the public relations office (at 
KAB)." 
  The aeroclub was discussed at last year's prefectural 
assembly session for its alleged involvement in providing 
fee-charging sightseeing flights to Japanese. The Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs issued a strong protest to the U.S. Forces 
saying such a practice was a violation of the Japan-U.S. Status 
of Forces Agreement, and that "such incidents would certainly 
lead to misunderstanding." [passage profiling aeroclub omitted]

<F P=106> [Comments by Zenkichi Teruya, chairman of Kin Township </F>
Assembly, and Tokujitsu Miyagi, mayor of Kadena, regarding 26 
March incident in which a Cessna airplane from Kadena Air Base 
made an emergency landing at Kin's Blue Beach] 
  [Text] [Teruya] I was shocked after first learning about 
the incident. Although I do not have all the details, we were 
lucky since it could have been worse, with one false move 
turning the incident into a great tragedy. The incident 
occurred because there are military bases on Okinawa. I feel 
both deep regret and anger. It is hoped such accidents will not 
occur in the future. 
  [Miyagi] I question whether there is room for an aeroclub on 
Kadena Air Base, which is already overcrowded as it is. The 
people of Kadena have been forced to endure unbearable 
conditions, with most of their town being taken away and used as 
a military base under the Japan-U.S. security arrangement. One 
false move could have turned the incident into a major accident. 
We will have the matter investigated, and depending on the 
results we may demand the aeroclub be abolished.

<F P=106> [Discussion between Masahide Ota, Okinawa Prefecture </F>
governor, and Tetsuya Tsukushi, newscaster and commentator for 
the Tokyo Broadcasting System, at the Okinawa Convention Center 
Theater in Ginowan City, Okinawa Prefecture, on 20 March; first 
five paragraphs are OKINAWA TIMES introduction] 
  [Text] Masahide Ota, Okinawa Prefecture governor, and 
Tetsuya Tsukushi, noted newscaster for the Tokyo Broadcasting 
System (TBS), held a discussion at the Okinawa Convention Center 
Theater in Ginowan City on 20 March, the last day of a musical 
event called the "Asia Music Pageant in Okinawa '94" (hosted by 
Okinawa Prefecture, Ginowan City, the OKINAWA TIMES, and the 
Ryukyu Broadcasting Company (RBC)). Their discussion, entitled 
"Okinawa in the Asia-Pacific Era," lasted 90 minutes. 
  Due to Tsukushi's popularity as a newscaster, there were 
many 
young people in the audience. The theater was filled to near 
capacity with an audience of 1,200 on hand. 
  The discussion, moderated by Tsukushi, covered a wide range 
of topics, including those entitled "The Power of Okinawan 
Culture, Which Retained Its Identity Under U.S. Military Rule," 
"Internationalization Based on a Distinct Culture," and 
"Japanization and Okinawa's Identity." 
  Tsukushi said: "In prefectures which seek social and 
economic 
vitalization, the people have fears and concerns about local 
depopulation due to a decreasing population. The average income 
in Okinawa is the lowest of any in the nation, but its 
population has continued to increase since the end of World War 
II. This, in effect, is Okinawa's answer to such concerns. 
Okinawan society shall serve as a model for the society that 
Japan is seeking to become." 
  Regarding the policy of peace which the prefectural 
government advocates, Governor Ota said: "To keep Okinawa's war 
experiences from becoming a thing of the past is a difficult but 
important task. We hope to accomplish this task and to continue 
to move forward." 
  [Tsukushi] Although internationalization is widely 
advocated, 
there are, on the other hand, many cases in which exchange 
students coming to Japan from other Asian countries develop 
anti-Japanese attitudes. However, for Okinawa, where there are 
1,400 exchange students, it is said that a majority of them 
return home with a good impression of the prefecture. 
  [Ota] I feel that this is because Okinawa and those 
countries 
have similar climates, living conditions, and cultures, in 
addition to similarities in terms of their historical 
backgrounds. Many Asian countries have experienced periods of 
rule by powerful Western nations, during which the peoples did 
not even have control over their destinies or living conditions. 
Although Okinawa did not come under colonial rule, I feel that 
Okinawa and Asian countries are connected by common cultural 
roots as oppressed peoples. 
  [Tsukushi] As for the current frictions between Japan and 
the 
United States, if Japan stressed its distinct uniqueness, the 
United States would try to undermine it by claiming that Japan 
is a "heterogeneous" country. Japan advocates the concept of 
internationalization, but the Japanese tend to group together 
among themselves, as can be seen in their conventional use of 
the term "gaijin" [foreigner]. On the other hand, I have the 
impression that Okinawans are more open psychologically. 
  [Ota] Asia is a multiethnic region with different religions 
and languages, but there are many things about Japan concerning 
a tendency to exclude alien cultures. During the days when it 
was a kingdom, Okinawa got along well for a long time with other 
countries, frequently coming in contact with "alien" cultures 
and accepting them. 
  [Tsukushi] There is a mistaken notion that being able to 
speak English fluently is equivalent to becoming 
internationalized. Even now, some people in mainland Japan have 
the gross misunderstanding that the Okinawan people speak 
English. There seem to be few Okinawans who have really 
mastered English. Here there seems to be a more open culture in 
which speaking English does not necessarily mean that one has 
become internationalized. 
  [Ota] There are many U.S. military personnel stationed on 
Okinawa, but exchanges cannot be conducted easily because they 
are confined inside chain-link fences. Moreover, the Americans 
ruled the Okinawans after the end of World War II. Therefore, 
even though Americans and Okinawans live in the same land, 
exchanges between the peoples have been impossible because of 
their relationship as rulers and the ruled. Exchanges truly can 
be carried out only on the basis of a relationship between equal 
partners. 
  [Tsukushi] When discussing the English language, there is 
the argument that English-language imperialism invades other 
cultures. Great Britain, which indirectly controlled India, 
trained a handful of local rulers who could speak English 
exactly like Englishmen. Although the United States came into 
Okinawa bringing all its military, political, economic, and 
cultural power, Okinawa did not turn out to be like India. When 
we think of the reasons for this, I believe that it was the 
power of Okinawan culture that helped it withstand the 
circumstances. 
  [Ota] The museum built in Shuri by the U.S. military 
symbolizes a U.S. policy which was aimed at alienating Okinawa 
from Japan. The United States asserted that "because the 
Okinawans developed such a fine culture in the days of the 
Ryukyuan Kingdom, they do not have to rely on the Japanese." At 
the time, there was a deep-rooted reaction among the Okinawans 
against such a U.S. policy, even though they were burdened with 
the problem of not being able to become economically 
self-sufficient. 
  [Tsukushi] The United States poured funds, called the high 
commissioner's funds -- which can be likened to funds set up by 
Mito Komon [popular name for Tokugawa Ieyasu's grandson and the 
second daimyo (1661-90) of the Mito domain, Tokugawa Mitsukuni, 
who invited Japanese and Chinese scholars to compile the 
History of Great Japan] -- into local districts to 
send over 1,000 Ryukyuan exchange students to the United States. 
However, they did not necessarily all end up having 
pro-American sentiments. 
  [Ota] The United States did intend to foster pro-American 
local nationals via the exchange student system. However, the 
pursuit of knowledge is immeasurably deep. The more a student 
devotes himself to it, the more he learns what human beings are 
all about. Eventually, he realizes how outrageous military rule 
is. 
  [Tsukushi] By getting an education in the United States, a 
student realizes the abnormal situation on Okinawa. This is so 
ironic. By the way, I feel that nowadays, young Okinawans are 
properly reexamining their identity, which is deep-rooted in 
their culture. With 20 years having passed since the reversion 
of Okinawa to Japan, they have gained confidence about what they 
are. I feel that this is a very healthy and wonderful thing. 
<H5>  Asia Music Pageant in Okinawa '94 </H5>
  [Tsukushi] I believe that the general theme of this musical 
event is related to people's identities. This is a chance for 
people to get in contact with other people--something like a 
contest--to try to confirm one's own identity in the process of 
mutual association. Otherwise, one shall end up indulging in 
self-complacency. I feel that it is important to educate people 
about what happened to Okinawa and what occurred there, 
historically speaking. There should be more opportunity for 
cultural exchanges and to hold discussions about peace. Frankly 
speaking, I feel annoyed when I visit the war memorial site at 
Mabuni-no-Oka. There, memorial engravings list war victims 
separately, according to their home prefectures. Mr. Ota, it 
seems that the prefectural government plans to construct a 
monument listing all victims who died during the Battle of 
Okinawa, regardless of where they hail from. 
  [Ota] I have visited India, Thailand, Burma, and recently 
Singapore. What I noticed in all these countries is that the 
young people there are proud about building their countries. 
They have great passion. It was overwhelming. However, this 
seems to be quite lacking among young people in Okinawa. As for 
peace, it is important for young Okinawans to learn properly 
about the circumstances under which their parents, brothers and 
sisters, and grandparents were forced into inhumane conditions. 
Whether you win or lose, war results in more and more people 
being hurt. We would like to build the "Peace Monument" to 
convey the message that war is meaningless. 
  [Tsukushi] I take it that the names of war victims from 
mainland Japan, Okinawa, Taiwan, and Korea are all to be 
engraved on this monument. Am I correct about that? 
  [Ota] Yes, and I think there will be over 200,000 names 
engraved on it. 
  [Tsukushi] I have also heard that some interesting incidents 
have come to light. These should also contribute to preventing 
Okinawa's war experiences from becoming a thing of the past. 
  [Ota] So far, war survivors have reported to the prefectural 
government's War Victims Relief Division the sacrifices they 
made in supporting the nation's military cause. If we look at 
the actual situation during the Battle of Okinawa, there were 
some people who were critical of the nation's war policy. Some 
of them were executed because they refused to turn over their 
important food supplies to the military. Therefore, with this 
project, the prefectural government has been trying to carry out 
investigations to include all victims from babies to the elderly. 
  [Tsukushi] In some cases, whole families were killed, and 
then there is no one left to report such cases. 
  [Ota] Many died together with their relatives and with 
entire 
family clans. 
  [Tsukushi] In another way, Okinawa carries with it the 
image of an island of military bases. 
  [Ota] The concept of peace is at the very foundation of 
Okinawan culture. From the days of the Ryukyuan king, Sho Shin, 
the Okinawan people were forbidden to carry weapons. After the 
Satsuma [of present-day Kagoshima Prefecture on Kyushu] invaded 
the Ryukyus in 1609, the ban on carrying weapons was enforced 
even more strictly. As a result, the Okinawans learned the 
martial art of karate to protect themselves. All these things 
have permeated the Okinawan way of life. Okinawans have 
maintained peace by establishing relations of mutual reliance 
with neighboring countries. 
  [Tsukushi] For the Okinawan people, the ground warfare--the 
so-called "typhoon of steel" [in World War II]--certainly took a 
very heavy toll. Incidentally, however, possibly greater damage 
has been done to Okinawa's natural environment since Okinawa's 
reversion to Japan in 1972 than during that period of ground 
warfare. 
  [Ota] The U.S. military has taken over Okinawans' precious 
farmland to use for military bases. Even very fertile parcels 
have all been taken away. Among other towns, Kadena has 83 
percent of its total area taken up by military bases, with over 
10,000 local residents being forced to live on the remaining 13 
percent [percentages as published]. They have no other choice. 
The prefectural government, for its part, seeks to get rid of 
military bases to protect the natural environment. This is a 
very difficult issue, but we hope to try not to destroy the 
environment.

  [Text] Regarding Russian President Boris Yeltsin's request 
to participate in the major industrialized nations' summit talks 
to be held in Naples, Italy, next July as a regular member, the 
Japanese Government has decided to suggest he join in 
discussions on political issues only. Japan will present this 
plan to the other G-7 countries at a preparatory meeting of 
private representatives of G-7 leaders (sherpas), and will start 
coordination to this end. This was disclosed by newlyappointed 
sherpa Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy vice minister of foreign affairs. 
  Hayashi said: "Regarding talks on economic issues, it is 
premature to invite Russia as a regular member nation and to 
hold G-8 talks. However, concerning talks on political issues, 
it is possible to hold G-8 meetings in addition to the regular 
G-7 talks."

<F P=106> [Interview with UN Ambassador Hatano by Moritatsu Tahara, </F>
reporter, MAINICHI SHIMBUN in New York; date not given] 
  [Text] [Boxed item: Yoshio Hatano was born in 1932. In 
1953, he quit his studies at Tokyo University's Law Faculty to 
work at the Foreign Ministry. Before assuming his current post 
as ambassador to the United Nations in February 1990, Mr. Hatano 
served as head of the Personnel Division of the Minister's 
Secretariat, head of the Middle Eastern and African Affairs 
Bureau, and ambassador of Japan's UN delegation in Geneva.] 
  Some say that the United Nations entered a new era after the 
Cold War ended, when it was faced with an upheaval in the 
international situation, i.e., the Gulf war. The advent of this 
new era was marked by the appointment of Butrus Butrus-Ghali as 
UN secretary general (January 1992). We asked Yoshio Hatano, UN 
ambassador, who has played a role in the "history of the new 
United Nations" for three-and-a-half years, including the two 
years in which Japan was a non-permanent member of the Security 
Council (until 1993), to describe the current situation at the 
United Nations. 
<H5>  Mountains of Requests for PKO Missions </H5>
  [EKONOMISUTO] What effects have the recent cataclysmic 
changes, including the collapse of the Berlin Wall, had on the 
United Nations? 
  [Hatano] During the Cold War, the United Nations did not 
reach agreements on any political problems. Nor did it reach 
agreements on economic problems either, since the interests of 
advanced nations and developing nations conflicted. Ultimately, 
the United Nations managed to justify its existence by handling 
social problems like refugee aid and human rights. 
  When the Cold War ended, the Security Council began to agree 
on political problems as well, and to lay the groundwork for 
world peace and security. I first became clearly aware of this 
change during the Gulf war. 
  The United Nations had acquired the confidence and the 
assertiveness to establish a "just peace" by intervening in 
disputes. 
  [EKONOMISUTO] Do you mean that the UN Secretariat has gained 
confidence? 
  [Hatano] No, I was referring to all the member nations. 
Furthermore, expectations of the United Nations are overly 
high. Now the prevailing notion is that the United Nations will 
intervene to establish a just peace any time a dispute occurs 
anywhere in the world. 
  Consequently, the United Nations now has no choice but to 
respond to these expectations. Even when it cannot expect to be 
successful, it cannot just stand back and do nothing. In 
particular, requests are beginning to come in from all over the 
world for PKO [peacekeeping operations] missions. 
  The atmosphere is such that the United Nations cannot refuse 
requests from other regions, because it dispatched PKO personnel 
to Cambodia. The United Nations has received mountains of 
requests for PKO missions. Many of them have been rejected, but 
the United Nations will have to take action in response to some 
of them. 
  [EKONOMISUTO] Some say that the United Nations has reached 
the limit as far as PKO is concerned. 
  [Hatano] Apparently, Secretary General Butrus-Ghali thinks 
that UN intervention will, of necessity, increase in the future. 
Then we have the question of how the United Nations will 
intervene, but that will depend on the effectiveness of previous 
Security Council resolutions. Therefore, nations that are not 
members of the Security Council have a difficult time making 
their influence felt. 
  [EKONOMISUTO] Does that mean that the Cambodian operation 
was 
successful? 
  [Hatano] Some members of the Security Council are of the 
opinion that the lessons learned from the Cambodian operation 
can be applied to Somalia as well. 
  One of those lessons is the merits of having refrained from 
using armed force. Furthermore, Japan sponsored a Cambodian aid 
conference, without waiting for the dispute to be resolved. The 
parties involved in the dispute realized that peace would bring 
them many tangible benefits. Another is the benefits from having 
maintained a cooperative relationship with local leaders, like 
Prince Sihanouk. That approach has been praised by members of 
the Security Council as well. 
  [EKONOMISUTO] But the financial burden on member nations, 
including Japan, seems to be ballooning, with no end in sight. 
  [Hatano] Two years ago, at a Security Council meeting at 
which the advisability of a particular PKO mission was being 
discussed, I asked, "Where will the money come from?" The reply 
I received was something like, "We are discussing peace and 
security. One cannot attach a price to peace and security." But 
recently, all member nations have begun to give serious 
consideration to the financial problem. This sort of awareness 
is increasing. 
  [EKONOMISUTO] Does that mean that some members are having 
second thoughts about PKO, now that the expense has risen so 
high? 
  [Hatano] I think it means that every nation is on the verge 
of being unable to shoulder its share of the PKO budget, which 
is three or four times the UN general budget. 
  For instance, if a peace agreement is reached in the former 
Yugoslavia, the cost of PKO in Yugoslavia alone will amount to 
three or four times the UN general budget. This is higher than 
what had been anticipated. It has become difficult for the 
members to justify the expense to the financial and taxation 
authorities at home. However, there is the argument that the 
alternative, war, would be far more costly. 
  [EKONOMISUTO] Do a majority of Security Council members, who 
rule on PKO missions, feel that the financial limit has been 
reached? 
  [Hatano] I don't think the limit has been reached yet, but 
we 
are approaching the limit as far as contributions are 
concerned. The situation is becoming difficult for the United 
States, whose share is so large, and even if Russia wanted to 
contribute, it doesn't have any money. 
  [EKONOMISUTO] Is there some regret over the Security 
Council's having authorized so many PKO missions over the past 
two years? 
  [Hatano] Secretary General Butrus-Ghali has often mentioned 
something to that effect, but I'm not sure he would be able to 
say no to a request. 
  For instance, Japan has been criticized by other nations for 
being unenthusiastic about PKO: "We cooperated with you in 
Cambodia. Don't you care about Africa or the former Soviet 
Union?" The secretary general, too, may find it difficult to 
refuse one request after granting another. 
<H5>  Japan and the Reformation of the Security Council </H5>
  [EKONOMISUTO] Then there is the problem of reforming the 
Security Council. Does the international community feel that 
reform is necessary? 
  [Hatano] I think that it does, without question. I have 
often 
said that the world is losing confidence in the Security Council 
in its present form. I think that doubts about the legitimacy of 
the Security Council, as it is now, have become a world issue. 
  The Security Council is set up so that a mere 15 nations now 
decide the fates of 184 member nations. All the non-permanent 
member nations have questioned the Security Council's current 
state. 
  The more vocal criticisms have been voiced by developing 
nations which became members after the United Nations was 
established. In other words, even though the North-South balance 
of the United Nations has changed, the North-South balance in 
the Security Council has not, and they want to see that 
corrected. 
  In the second place, Japan and Germany have become major 
powers, both economically and politically. One questions the 
advisability of keeping these two nations out of the Security 
Council. 
  Another problem is the lack of transparency of the Security 
Council -- the opinion that more member nations should be able 
to participate in the Security Council's decision-making 
process, even indirectly. 
  [EKONOMISUTO] The permanent member nations of the Security 
Council say that if it acquires more members, it will be less 
efficient. 
  [Hatano] At first glance, one gets the impression that the 
Security Council is efficient because its membership is small. 
But one might question how many of the decisions made by the 
Security Council, which is now being subjected to criticism, 
have been effective. During the past two years, it has issued 
many resolutions and president's declarations, but the truth is 
that many of them did not produce the desired results. 
  On the other hand, there is no point in making the Security 
Council an organization with dozens of member nations, one that 
has difficulty reaching a conclusion. This is a question of 
balance, so some have suggested keeping the current 15 members, 
and adding a few. 
  [EKONOMISUTO] How has Japan's status in the United Nations 
changed? 
  [Hatano] Japan is now a major presence at the United 
Nations. 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali said so himself when he visited 
Japan. 
  In material terms, Japan is the second-largest contributor 
to 
the United Nations, after the U.S. Japan ranks high in providing 
human resources as well. Japan has provided five top-ranking 
officials in UN organizations, including Special Envoy to 
Yugoslavia Akashi, High Commissioner for Refugees Ogata, and WHO 
Chairman Nakajima. Secretary General Butrus-Ghali has said that 
the only nations having so many of its citizens in key positions 
at the United Nations are the United States and Japan and, in 
actuality, Japan is viewed as a major force there. Furthermore, 
Japanese who are members of important committees were elected to 
those committees with huge majorities of votes. 
  It is probably not my place to determine whether Japan is a 
major power at the United Nations. However, an objective point 
of view is that Japan has already become a major force within 
the United Nations. Despite that status, people are saying that 
Japan's political aspirations are those of a middle-sized 
nation, so we will probably hear more accusations of avoiding 
responsibility. 
  [EKONOMISUTO] Is it appropriate to assume that Japan desires 
to become a permanent member of the Security Council? 
  [Hatano] All the members are aware of Prime Minister 
Hosokawa's address to the UN General Assembly, and of media 
reports. They also know that until now, Japan has not declared 
its intention to establish equality with other nations. 
  That is why the secretary general expressed his wish for 
Japan to become more active, on his second visit to Japan, by 
saying "the United Nations would benefit from Japan's becoming a 
permanent member of the Security Council." 
<H5>  The UN Bureaucracy </H5>
  [EKONOMISUTO] The members' opinions of Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali seem to vary wildly. 
  [Hatano] I think he's a strong leader. He's been called 
stubborn, and an autocrat, but he will not go against his 
beliefs. 
  He says, jokingly, "I'm past 70 now. At this point, my 
character is not going to change," so he seems to be aware that 
he has been criticized in various ways. 
  The members recognize the secretary general's strong 
leadership and his ability to get things done. Furthermore, he 
has a great affection for Japan. 
  [EKONOMISUTO] Even a man with such strong leadership ability 
may find it difficult to reform the bureaucratic structure of 
the Secretariat. The United States and other nations say that 
there is too much inefficiency. 
  [Hatano] It could accurately be called an inefficient 
organization. But it is the member nations who are to blame, 
not the secretary general. The developing nations are opposed to 
the reform and rationalization of economic development, which 
the secretary general feels should be given top priority. 
  The secretary general has himself criticized the 
bureaucratic structure of the United Nations, and is doing his 
utmost to reform it. Nor are the member nations at all happy 
with the bureaucratic structure, but they protest when personnel 
reductions are suggested. No nation wants one of its citizens to 
lose his UN job. The advanced nations are guilty of this, too. 
They say rationalization is necessary, but they don't want any 
of their people to be laid off. The same goes for Japan. 
  [EKONOMISUTO] Is the United States an exception? 
  [Hatano] The United States is hoping that the United Nations 
will rationalize its headquarters, and downsize it. Since the 
United States is the host country for UN headquarters, and bears 
25 percent of the burden of the UN general budget, and 30 
percent of the PKO budget, the United Nations has been quite 
cautious in its relationship with the United States. 
  [EKONOMISUTO] At a time when the roles of the United Nations 
and its Security Council are growing in importance, Japan is not 
one of the (nonpermanent) members of the Security Council. 
  [Hatano] I think this will put us in a very difficult 
position. 
  If, by some chance, the United Nations decides to augment 
the 
PKO in the former Yugoslavia, then we'll be told, "All right, 
Japan's share is $500 million." Japan is unable to voice its 
opinions during the decision-making process at the Security 
Council. 
  Then, there is the problem of nuclear weapons on the Korean 
peninsula. If, in the worst case, a proposal for sanctions 
against North Korea is brought before the Security Council, we 
will have to wait outside the Security Council hall until the 
member nations' ambassadors come out and tell us how the debate 
is proceeding. 
  Of course, we would hold thorough discussions with the 
United 
States and other nations on the subject before it is debated in 
the Council. But that is quite different from being able to 
participate directly in the discussion. 
  Three-and-a-half years ago, when I arrived in New York to 
assume my current position, my first experience was the Gulf war 
problem. I waited outside the Security Council until the member 
nations' ambassadors emerged, and asked them, "What happened? 
What happened?" That scenario was repeated, and the result of 
the debate was that Japan was presented with a bill for $11 
billion, and was criticized, to boot.... A situation like this 
would be unthinkable in Western Europe. The conventional wisdom 
there is "no taxation without representation." 
<H5>  Japan's Status in the United Nations </H5>
  [EKONOMISUTO] Nevertheless, has Japan's importance increased 
over the past three tumultuous years? 
  [Hatano] Until PKO's increased scale, until the PKO budget 
reached three or four times the UN general budget, Japan's 
contribution to the general budget was 12.45 percent, or $1.1 
billion. Now that our assessed contribution has risen to more 
than 12 percent of a PKO budget of more than $3 billion, Japan's 
status has certainly risen. 
  Furthermore, Japan is popular with the member nations. The 
developing nations count on Japan to act as their 
representative, to convey their views to the advanced nations. 
They feel this way partly because Japan provides economic aid, 
but their overall expectations of Japan are quite high. 
  On the other hand, the advanced nations view Japan as a 
nation that espouses the same value system as they do. There 
aren't many occasions on which the advanced nations and 
developing nations form separate opposing blocs, but in 
committees, the Human Rights Committee for example, the 
difference between the two groups is marked. 
  I receive requests such as, "Japan is the representative of 
the Asia group, isn't it? Please explain Asia's position to the 
advanced nations, and try to convince them." On the other hand, 
the advanced nations will tell me, "Please explain our position 
to the Asia group." The good side of this situation is that 
Japan might be said to be acting as a bridge between the two 
blocs of nations. The bad side is that we can find ourselves at 
a disadvantage, caught in the middle. 
  Once, when we were deciding upon candidates for an election 
within the Asia group, one of the ambassadors said, "Japan's 
views are not representative of Asian views, and its people run 
for election too often. The best thing Japan could do for the 
Asia group would be to leave it. That would also be in Japan's 
best interest." I was quite shocked by that statement, but I 
learned a lesson from it. 
  When we continue to gain favor with the advanced nations and 
the developing nations, and are viewed by both groups as a 
nation that is doing a good job, we know that Japan has a very 
visible presence. In other words, Japan has become a major power. 
  It is time for Japan to assert its own opinions. Even if we 
make enemies, it's time for us to follow through. We may end up 
making enemies temporarily but, in the long term, Japan will 
become a nation that is respected and trusted.

  [Text] YOMIURI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide public 
opinion poll on 19-20 March to determine the trend in public 
support for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's administration. 
The results showed the Hosokawa cabinet's approval rating 
decreased 2.9 percent from last month, down to 55.1 percent. 
This was a decrease for the second consecutive month, with the 
cabinet marking its worst support rating. 
  Of the respondents, 34 percent expressed disapproval of the 
cabinet, up 4.5 percent over last month. Regarding policies 
they disapproved of, 48 percent of the respondents cited "rice 
and other farm policies," a surge of approximately 20-percent 
over last month. This indicates that the people's complaints 
regarding the rice shortage have gushed out. 
  The latest cabinet approval rating is still high in 
comparison to those of previous cabinets. The Hosokawa 
administration, which faces difficult problems, such as the 
growing discord in the ruling coalition alliance and the 
considerable delay in deliberations over the draft national 
budget for the next fiscal year, has relied heavily on its high 
approval rating to keep itself going. However, the continued 
decline seems to have dealt it a serious blow. 
  Regarding reasons for supporting the cabinet, 53 percent of 
the respondents expressed passive approval of the cabinet, 
saying "it is at least better than previous cabinets." However, 
the percent decreased as regards other reasons for supporting 
the cabinet. For example, only 18 percent said "the cabinet's 
political stance can be rated highly." 
  Ratings for the administration's policies also decreased in 
nearly all areas. For example, 34 percent of the respondents 
said they highly rated the cabinet as regards "political reform 
and political ethics." 
  As for reasons for not supporting the cabinet, 21 percent of 
the respondents said "it has accomplished nothing noteworthy," a 
marked 6-percent increase over last month. 
  As for policies disapproved of by the respondents, "rice and 
other farm policies" topped of the list, with 48 percent of the 
respondents citing it. This was followed by "economic and price 
policies" at 44 percent, and a "tax system policy" at 33 
percent. The disapproval rating for "rice and other farm 
policies" increased by 19 percent over last month. This is an 
indication of strong public disapproval over the government's 
mishandling of the rice shortage issue.

  [Text] A nationwide poll conducted by YOMIURI SHIMBUN on 
19 and 20 March shows that the percentage of those who hope "the 
Hosokawa government should be in power as long as possible" has 
drastically decreased from six months ago. On the question of 
which party they would vote for in the next general election, 
the number of those who said they would vote for the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] increased, while the percentage of those who would vote 
for the Japan New Party [JNP] dropped by 7 points. The results 
show signs of Hosokawa's popularity waning. 
  Asked why they think the ruling coalition was thrown into 
confusion over the plans to reshuffle the cabinet and introduce 
a national welfare tax, the pollees raised the following 
reasons: 1) Because Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Chief 
Secretary Ichiro Ozawa exerted too much influence on the plans; 
2) because, from the beginning, it was impossible for the ruling 
parties to coordinate their opinions; and 3) because Prime 
Minister Hosokawa acted a bit arbitrarily. 
  "Asked how many years they want the Hosokawa government to 
be 
in power," 33 percent said another year, 25 percent said another 
two or three years, 19 percent said the government should step 
down from power immediately, and 17 percent hoped it would be in 
power as long as possible. The same question was posed in polls 
conducted last September, and January this year. Compared with 
the results of the September poll, the percentage of those who 
want the government to be in power "as long as possible" 
decreased by 14 points, those who said "another year" increased 
by 15 points, and those who want the government to get out of 
power immediately increased by 8 points. 
  In answering what parties they would vote for if the general 
election is conducted, 28 percent said they would vote for the 
LDP, 11 percent for the JNP, 10 percent each for Shinseito and 
the SDPJ, and 5 percent for Sakigake [Harbinger]. Compared with 
the results of the January poll, the LDP and the SDPJ gained 
about 2 to 3 points, while the JNP lost a lot. Nevertheless, 
the LDP and the SDPJ are far from the level of the approval 
ratings they obtained last June -- 31 percent and 15 percent 
respectively. The June poll was conducted immediately before 
last year's general election in which the LDP and the SDPJ were 
decidedly defeated.

<F P=106> [Interview with Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa by </F>
TOKYO SHIMBUN reporters Makoto Ogino and Yoji Gomi; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] [TOKYO SHIMBUN] How do you think the realignment 
of political parties will progress from now on? 
  [Ichikawa] There are three factors that will affect the 
course of political realignment. One is how the ruling parties 
should form a political force strong enough to compete against 
the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. The other is how 
to select recognized candidates for single-seat constituencies. 
The last is when the next general election will be conducted. 
None of them has been given apparent answers. However, if the 
budget bill is passed during the current Diet session, the pace 
of political realignment will be greatly accelerated. If this 
happens, the chief factor that gears up the realignment will be 
the way to select candidates. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] How does Komeito intend to deal with the 
realignment? 
  [Ichikawa] We characterize the new electoral system as a 
tool to select a force that can take the reins of government. 
The change of government is the most effective measure to 
prevent political corruption. Together with other ruling 
parties, we want to establish a new political force that can 
compete against the LDP and has only one name. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] There are also moves within the ruling 
coalition to unite social democrats and liberals. 
  [Ichikawa] Right now, it looks as if the ruling parties were 
announcing their own ideas at separate studios. We will be able 
to understand each other if we discuss at the same studio and 
the same table. We all know that, unless the ruling parties 
unite, the Hosokawa reform government will collapse. I think 
the ruling parties will be merged into a large political force 
under the goal of promoting reforms together. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What do you think of the idea that Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party] and the Japan New Party [JNP] should form 
a parliamentary group first? 
  [Ichikawa] It is ideal that all the ruling parties form a 
parliamentary group at one time. But because there is still 
concern, which has been caused by misunderstanding, that the 
realignment of political parties might be promoted under the 
initiative of Shinseito and Komeito, I think it is favorable if 
Shinseito and the JNP play a major role in uniting the ruling 
parties. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] How will the ruling parties select 
candidates for the next general election? 
  [Ichikawa] Leading Diet members of the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan and other ruling parties all think that "the 
ruling parties will not be able to win in the election unless 
they cooperate" and that "it is better to begin as soon as 
possible the work to select candidates." Once the budget bill 
is passed, down-to-earth arguments of this kind will crop up all 
at once and arguments over whether Japan should take a bipolar 
or tripolar political system in the future will fade away. A 
block of frozen ice melts quickly once it begins to melt. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] There is also an opinion that because the 
ruling parties find it difficult to unite themselves, they 
should only cooperate in the election. 
  [Ichikawa] Under the new electoral system, it is impossible 
for the ruling parties to win in the election unless they 
campaign as a single party. When the work to select candidates 
actually begins, those who say "I should be separated [from the 
other group that supports a bipolar system] in the selection 
because I advocate a tripolar system" will be excluded from the 
selection. Sakigake [Harbinger] has power only because the 
party, in cooperation with the JNP, can hold the post of chief 
cabinet secretary. If Sakigake stands by itself, it will become 
just like the now-defunct Shinjiyu [New Liberal] Club. Unless 
the party is free from emotion and ideals, it will take a wrong 
course. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Some people are critical of the alliance 
between you and Shinseito Chief Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, saying 
you two act high-handedly. 
  [Ichikawa] After its inauguration, the ruling coalition was 
urged to make decisions on important issues, such as the partial 
liberalization of the rice market and political reform. Who 
made the decisions? While others were arguing, Mr. Ozawa and I 
made the decisions and took the blame for it. It is the people 
who evaluate what we have done. As a politician, I do not 
regret what I have done. Mr. Ozawa and I have different 
political ideas and styles. Mass media's reports on our alliance 
are based on their imagination.

  [Text] Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister, foreign 
minister, and head of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], gave a 
news conference at a hotel in Kikuchi city, Kumamoto Prefecture, 
on 27 March. He commented on the policy study group proposed by 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for the purpose of uniting the 
ruling coalition parties into a big parliamentary group, and he 
stressed: "Prime Minister Hosokawa has suggested creating a 
study group. It is necessary to form (a unified group) after 
taking such steps." He added, "When elections are held under 
the single-seat constituency system, coordination (on choosing 
candidates) will be necessary," thus indicating his intention to 
use the policy study group as a venue to coordinate the 
selection of candidates. 
  Moving on to the issue of the realignment of political 
parties, Hata said, "I believe it would be good for the present 
ruling coalition parties to become a monolithic group." He 
reiterated that he wishes to form a large unified group of the 
ruling parties and eventually to found a new-new party 
[shin-shinto]. 
  With regard to the plan for Shinseito to unite first with 
the 
Japan New Party in the process of forming a large parliamentary 
grouping, Hata said: "It is still too soon. There is the 
question of what to do with the other parties. There are times 
when you need to do things in the right order. However, nothing 
is definite yet." He thus indicated that it is not wise to raise 
this issue at this stage. 
  Meanwhile, Shinseito Managing Secretary Hajime Funada also 
gave a speech in Toyonaka town, Kagawa Prefecture, on the same 
day. As for the policy study group, Funada said: 
"Organizations like this will also form the basis for selecting 
a common candidate (for the ruling coalition parties). 
Shinseito thinks that this will contribute to forming a unified 
group, and a new-new party in the future." He indicated that 
the study group should be the basis for coordinating in 
selecting candidates in the future.

  [Text] The Kagoshima Prefectural headquarters of the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] held a meeting in 
Kagoshima city on 26 March. On the issue of the next general 
election for the House of Representatives, Wataru Kubo, 
secretary general of the SDPJ, told the meeting: "If the 
general election were to be held before this autumn, it would be 
under the present multiseat constituency system. The ruling 
coalition parties need to prepare for their election campaign 
under any electoral system. They need to cooperate with each 
other in the next general election." 
  He indicated the need for the ruling coalition parties to 
speedily prepare themselves for electoral cooperation in 
anticipation that the next general election will be held under 
the current multiseat constituency system once the House of 
Representatives has been dissolved. 
  Commenting on moves by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] to 
form a new party, he expressed again a negative view. 
  He said: "It will be difficult for the ruling coalition 
parties to form a new party unless they reach a general 
consensus on the view of the state, the Constitution, and 
political tactics."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "SDPJ Is at Loss on How To Deal With </F>
Economic Sanctions Against North Korea"] 
  [Text] As one of the ruling coalition partners, the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is at a loss over how to deal 
with the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear development. 
The other ruling coalition parties have said, if the UN 
Security Council decides to impose economic sanctions on North 
Korea, "Japan should go along with them." 
  However, Chairman Murayama of the SDPJ, which has maintained 
friendly relations with the Workers' Party of Korea in North 
Korea, has said, "Japan should work for dialogue with North 
Korea rather than go along with the economic sanctions 
immediately." 
  There are concerns within the government and ruling 
coalition 
parties that a rift could be created in the coalition government 
depending on what action the SDPJ takes. 
  The UN Security Council has begun studying the possibility 
of 
imposing economic sanctions against North Korea after it refused 
to allow inspections of its nuclear facilities by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. In response, the SDPJ, at a 
24 March meeting of its Central Executive Committee, decided to 
speedily study its strategy in dealing with the issue of North 
Korea's suspected nuclear development. 
  It is possible that, during Diet deliberations, SDPJ cabinet 
members could be asked to vote on whether U.S. Forces in Japan 
impose a naval blockade against North Korea as part of economic 
sanctions. The party, therefore, has concluded that it needs to 
shape a party consensus on the issue of North Korea's suspected 
nuclear development. 
  The SDPJ plans to announce its official view after 
collecting 
information starting early this week. People in the SDPJ are 
increasingly cautious about how to handle the issue. Secretary 
General Kubo says the party wants to "adopt a policy of dialogue 
with North Korea" on the grounds that: 1) It fears that North 
Korea might respond to external pressure by acts of terrorism; 
and 2) there is no guarantee that the imposition of economic 
sanctions against North Korea will force the country to accept 
the nuclear inspections. 
  For this reason, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and other 
ruling coalition parties are saying "it is difficult to predict 
whether the SDPJ will announce a responsible policy on the issue 
as a ruling party." 
  It is said the SDPJ has always been "pro-North Korea" in its 
longstanding policy on the Korean peninsula. The SDPJ 
normalized its relations with South Korea when former Chairman 
Yamahana visited that country last September. There is a 
feeling the relationship between the SDPJ and the Workers' Party 
of Korea is not in good shape. The SDPJ, however, plans to 
continue its friendly relations with the Workers' Party of 
Korea. The U.S. Congress is concerned that the "Hosokawa 
government may not be able to deal resolutely with the issue of 
North Korea's suspected nuclear development because cabinet 
members have close ties with North Korea." 
  A Shinseito source said some people in the ruling coalition 
parties are wary of the SDPJ, saying "we will have to work so as 
not to produce a useless international misunderstanding."

<F P=106> [Article by Hiroko Ota, visiting assistant professor of </F>
Osaka University and member of the Hiraiwa Commission: "Hiraiwa 
Report Weak on Current Account Surplus Problem: MOF's Wall of 
Fiscal Supremacy"] 
  [Text] 1. How to handle the current account imbalance 
has become the weakest part of the Hiraiwa Report (final report 
of Economic Reform Research Committee). 
  2. The "domestic emphasis" approach of achieving a 
reduction in the current account surplus through improving the 
quality of life has been supported by the research committee. 
This purport is not reflected in the report. 
  3. The choice of financial resources for social 
infrastructure spending holds important meaning as a specific 
policy concerning this problem. However, a fiscal viewpoint has 
been placed at the center of financial resources rather than 
macroeconomic policy. As a result, it fails to propose specific 
policy by the "domestic emphasis" approach. 
<H5>  Savings Not Tied to Public Investment </H5>
  The Economic Reform Research Committee started by embracing 
various issues such as relaxation of regulations and conversion 
of the industrial structure. Important among them is the theme 
of how to handle the current account imbalance. This is a topic 
carried over from the Maekawa Report. 
  However, the handling of this topic is the weakest. Without 
specific proposals, it describes the situation as if it were 
someone else's affair that someday "it will be close to a form 
that can harmonize internationally." 
  Why is there such a big setback like this on the most 
important topic? I should like to examine this issue looking 
back over the course of the discussions. 
  The message of the Maekawa Report is that the current 
account 
surplus should be reduced for the sake of international harmony. 
It states that the aim will be an improvement in the quality of 
the people's life through the process of that realization. 
  It is not generally known, but at the first meeting of the 
Hiraiwa Research Committee, many members voiced the opinion that 
a reverse approach from the Maekawa Report should be taken. In 
other words, first aim at an improvement in the quality of life 
and reform the domestic economic structure. A reduction in the 
current account surplus will be achieved as a result. It should 
be called a "domestic emphasis" approach, so to speak. 
  If reduction of the current account surplus is cited as the 
main goal, it seems that the goal will be achieved just by 
reduction of the surplus through economic recovery. The reason 
that the proposal of the Maekawa Report came to an impasse 
probably lies here. What is needed now is examination of the 
structural part of the current account surplus, and it should 
begin with domestic issues before attempting the reduction of 
the current account surplus. 
<H3>  "Domestic Emphasis" Not Reflected; Social Infrastructure 
Spending by Construction Bonds </H3>
  Consequently, taking a "domestic emphasis" approach is 
correct, and I also approve. However, this initial purport 
unfortunately is not reflected in the final report. 
  People are saving for homes and old age. Not a small portion 
of those savings are directed to overseas asset holdings without 
ties to private investment or public investment. Domestic social 
capital is still as meager as ever, and precious savings for old 
age are being exposed to asset employment risks such as foreign 
exchange losses. 
  This is the issue of Japan's economic structure which is 
involved in the current account surplus. 
  The effective use of household savings domestically, 
direction toward necessary investment, improvement in the 
quality of life, and the practice of good-quality stock 
formation for old age: such changes in structure are "economic 
reform." 
  There is an important policy for such domestic reforms and 
the key that will tie it to reduction of the current account 
surplus, or in other words, the "domestic emphasis" approach. 
That is the choice of financial resources (taxes or bonds) for 
social infrastructure spending. 
  Let's explain this a little. If savings exceed investments, 
there will be an increase in debt (government bonds) for the 
government or debt to foreign countries. Consequently, reduction 
of the current account surplus is tantamount to increasing 
private consumption and investment (expansion of domestic 
demand) or expansion of the fiscal deficit. 
  By increased issue of construction bonds, the weight of the 
composition of public assets will shift from foreign assets to 
government bonds and that of the macro resource allocation from 
foreign investment and consumption to domestic social capital. 
In other words, it means that household savings are directly 
connected to repletion of the domestic living and industrial 
bases. 
  So long as expansion of the fiscal deficit is completely 
offset by expansion of the private-sector savings and investment 
differential, the current account surplus will decrease. 
  Thus, the financial resource for social infrastructure 
spending has a close relationship with macro resource 
allocation. General concern about the current account balance is 
concentrated on whether or not numerical goals for surplus 
reduction will be established. As a specific policy issue, 
however, this financial resource issue is a very important theme. 
<H5>  Theory of Burden on Future Generations Lacks Accuracy </H5>
  An intense dispute developed in the research committee 
concerning the financial resource for social infrastructure 
spending. 
  There are two viewpoints in the financial resource dispute. 
One is the public burden, particularly the issue related to the 
balance of the burden between generations, and the other is the 
macroeconomic policy mentioned previously. 
  Of course, the latter viewpoint is important in the 
"domestic emphasis" approach. Looking from this viewpoint, the 
increased issue of construction bonds to carry out social 
infrastructure spending is clearly desired. 
  In other words, what is the best way to hold public savings? 
Viewing the current state of Japan, it is necessary to reduce 
the relative weight of foreign debt and hold high-quality social 
capital domestically. That is done by issuing construction bonds. 
  Unfortunately, however, discussion from this viewpoint is 
not 
fully made. That is because the argument against construction 
bonds is made only within the framework of the burden on future 
generations. That is as follows: 
  "If social infrastructure spending is made with government 
debt, it will defer the bill for the debt to future generations 
and conversely inflict pain on them." 
  This concept is easy to accept at first glance; however, it 
is not correct because the point that government debt and the 
debt for the economy overall are confused. Government bonds are 
a liability for the government, but an asset for the people who 
hold the government bonds. 
  When the government redeems its bonds, a stratum receiving 
the redemption (owners of government bonds) will exist at the 
same time. Consequently, viewed by the economy overall, it is 
not a debt. Redemption of government bonds is no more than a 
transfer of income inside a future generation. 
  Next, "The cumulative increase in the government bond 
balance 
will bring an increase in government bond costs and hold down 
future policy expenditures." 
  Such a problem in budget compilation certainly will be 
generated. Even now, government bond costs have risen to 21.3 
percent of general account expenditures (initial budget). 
  However, it is not good to focus only on the future burden 
concerning this problem because it is possible to exceed fixed 
tax revenues by issue of government bonds and execute it 
anticipating future problems. Social capital is an issue that 
should be started at an early point in time. Consequently, in 
this sense, not balancing public finance is rather desired at 
this time. 
  Moreover, in the case of construction bonds, assets will 
remain corresponding to the amount of the government bond issue. 
Consequently, with regard to the cumulative increase in the 
government bond balance, the size itself is almost meaningless. 
  So, the problem is which to emphasize, this fiscal viewpoint 
or the aforementioned macroeconomic policy viewpoint. 
  The conclusion of the financial resource dispute is the 
following sentence: 
  " To secure financial resources that will not leave a burden 
on future generations as the premise, a review should be 
conducted of the basic plan for public investment..." 
  It had been "(tax) financial resources" in the draft, but at 
the final stage, the word (tax) was taken out. As already 
mentioned, construction bonds also do not leave a burden on 
future generations. Consequently, the choice of tax or bond is 
not made in this part. 
  On the other hand, no reference is made in the report 
regarding the financial resources desired from the viewpoint of 
macroeconomic policy. 
<H5>  Taxes Lose Mobility as Financial Resource </H5>
  The most important route in the "domestic emphasis" approach 
disappears here. Financial resources appear to be a small 
problem, but it was an important point involving the framework 
of the report. 
  As a postscript, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) does not 
perceive the logic that construction bonds do not leave a burden 
on future generations. Consequently, the "financial resources" 
written in the report probably are interpreted to indicate taxes. 
  If that interpretation goes unchallenged, there is a great 
possibility that an increase amount in the basic plan on public 
investment will not be realized. That is because there are great 
limitations on financial resources, but this is the biggest 
problem point when taxes are considered the financial resource. 
In other words, there is a possibility that the necessary 
investment cannot be made in the necessary time period. 
  Viewed in terms of results, it must be said that the 
"domestic emphasis" approach is defeated by MOF fiscal 
supremacy. Fiscal supremacy conceives that a fiscal balance has 
precedence over the Japanese economy. 
  If the people's savings are used effectively, the living 
base 
and future industrial base will rapidly be made replete, and it 
will be possible to obtain more affluence. However, the report 
fails to point out the way.

<F P=106> [By Mark J. Valencia: "A Spratly Solution"] </F>
  [Text] At long last a solution to the vexing dispute over 
the Spratly Islands may be possible. Claimed in whole or in part 
bv China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei, 
the geopolitical issues at stake here extend far beyond mere 
ownership of these scattered, fly-speck islands and any oil the 
area may harbour. How these contested claims are resolved will 
tell us much about the future economic and security arrangements 
in post-Cold War Southeast Asia. 
  The surprise agreement between China Petroleum (Taiwan), 
China National Offshore Oil (China) and Chevron (U.S.) to form a 
joint venture for oil exploration in the East China and South 
China Seas suggests a way out. Although the spectre of a 
China-Taiwan "united front" on South China Sea issues is not 
without its dangers, it may make an agreement easier now that 
the competition between them will be muted and other claimants 
will no longer have to choose between China and Taiwan. 
  For with the U.S. role perceived to be diminishing, China's 
longer term intentions are of particular concern. Partly in 
response, Asean has begun to consider security cooperation; 
Indonesia is attempting to assert some leadership in Southeast 
Asia; and Vietnam, isolated and vulnerable, is attempting to 
embrace Asean. All of these factors come together in the 
Spratlys. A major sticking point today is that despite Beijing's 
initial offer to put the sovereignty issue aside and to develop 
the area jointly, it now appears to insist that other claimants 
first recognise its sovereignty before joint development is 
possible. 
  This complicates a solution, but it does not make it 
impossible. The key is first to settle the outstanding 
grievances between Vietnam and China, which involve areas 
outside the core Spratly area -- on land, in the Gulf of Tonkin 
and at sea in the Vanguard Bank area, where China awarded a 
concession to Crestone Oil of the U.S. Certainly Vietnam's 
interests lie in coming to some kind of agreement. One way out 
would be for China and Taiwan to set aside their "historic" 
claim to most of the South China Sea in exchange for a combined 
share of 51 percent in a multilateral Spratly Development 
Authority, which would administer the core area and manage the 
exploration and exploitation of resources there. If Vietnam 
received a favourable settlement in the Tonkin Gulf and Vanguard 
Bank areas, it might consider settling for less shares in the 
Spratly area. Since Brunei claims only a tiny portion of the 
core area, its share would be very small. The remaining shares 
would be allocated among Vietnam, the Philippines and Malavsia. 
Although China and Taiwan might argue that their 51 percent 
share in the Spratly Development Authority constitutes tacit 
recognition by the other claimants of the validity of China's 
sovereignty claims, the other could rightly counter that, far 
from relinquishing their claims, all they did was agree to 
shelve them. 
  Indeed, under this cooperative regime the area would be 
demilitarised, sovereignty claims would be frozen and the 
Authority would resolve user conflicts, facilitate exploration 
and development of resources, manage fisheries and maintain 
environmental quality. The legitimate transit of vessels would 
be allowed. The authority might also promote international 
cooperation in scientific research and in protecting vulnerable 
ecosystems. 
  Since the core area would be removed from contention, and 
China and Taiwan would have set aside their historic line claim, 
the relevant countries could then focus their efforts on those 
areas outside the core area claimed by only two or three 
governments, e.g., the southwestern margin claimed by Indonesia 
and Vietnam; the southern margin claimed by Brunei and Malaysia; 
and the northern portion claimed by China, Taiwan, Vietnam and 
the Philippines. Eventually, sovereignty over the islands and 
rocks themselves might either pass to the occupants or be 
allocated among the different countries on an equitable basis. 
Either way, the involved countries would be entitled only to 
narrow territorial seas, could not use their respective areas 
for military purposes and would have to grant access for 
scientific research and -- more important -- any resources the 
areas might harbour. 
  Certainly this solution is not perfect. It is complicated, 
and the claimants would doubtless have various objections. But 
it deserves some consideration, especially given the general 
recognition that conflict would have far-reaching negative 
implications for regional and great-power relations. Indeed, 
already the governments involved continue to talk both 
informally (the Indonesia-sponsored meetings), bilaterally 
(China and Vietnam) and regionally (e.g., the Manila Asean 
Post-Ministerial Conference and probably in the Asean Regional 
Forum). In principle they all have agreed to a peaceful 
settlement. There is, moreover, wide support for the concept of 
joint development. Malaysia and. the Philippines, for example, 
have agreed to cooperate in fisheries in their area of overlap. 
  But the window of opportunity may be closing. Unless these 
nations move quickly, they may find that they have lost not just 
a solution to the Spratlys but the opportunity to take an 
important step towards a collective security arrangement that 
could guarantee the peace and development of the region well 
into the future.

Article   Type:CSO 

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan and the United States Should Strengthen </F>
Cooperative Relations From a Global Viewpoint"] 
  [Text] Serious economic friction is increasing mutual 
distrust between Japan and the United States. Washington 
asserts that "Japan does not take actions unless external 
pressure is applied," while Tokyo retorts that "the U.S. method 
of seeking concessions with a threat of sanctions is 
unacceptable." 
  Intensifying friction between Japan and the United States, 
two economic giants in the world, is not good for the growth of 
the world economy. Japan should propose concrete market-opening 
measures in trade negotiations with the United States. 
Meanwhile, the U.S. policy of seeking "results-oriented" 
economic goals is not advantageous to future relations. The two 
countries will be able to cooperate in areas of common interest 
and expand scope of cooperation. 
  Since he took office, U.S. President Bill Clinton has listed 
the reconstruction of the U.S. economy as his top priority task. 
In accordance with this policy, the United States has taken a 
hardline stand in negotiations with Japan. After the breakdown 
of the Japan-U.S. summit in February, Washington reinstated the 
Super 301 provision of the trade act (which outlines steps for 
retaliation against trade partners' unfair practices). The 
United States reinstated the provision apparently because it 
thought Super 301 was "an effective tool" to press Japan to open 
its market wider. 
  However, some Americans say there are problems with the 
Clinton administration's policy toward Japan. They say that 
there are some U.S. Government officials and negotiators who 
"regard Japan as a peculiar country" and assert that a hardline 
policy toward Japan is effective. They also point out that the 
administration's decisionmaking process toward Japan is not 
transparent. 
  Glen Fukushima, formerly in charge of Japanese affairs in 
the 
Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, said: "The U.S. 
administration does not have a clear, consistent, and harmonious 
trade policy toward Japan." 
  The Clinton administration weighs economic interests heavily 
in its policy toward Japan and in its Asia policy. But some 
Asian countries are concerned about U.S. ways of handling trade 
and human rights issues. 
  With midterm elections set for this autumn, Clinton is 
expected to continue a policy that emphasizes economic 
interests. However, the U.S. "results-oriented" approach of 
seeking concessions from its trading partners could prove 
disadvantageous in the long run. 
  Of course, Japan needs to reflect on its passive response 
and 
delays in decisionmaking that eventually resulted in criticism 
from trading partners. The European Union and Asian countries 
are critical of the reinstatement of the Super 301 clause. But 
at the same time, they urge Japan to open its market wider. 
French Industry Minister Gerard Longuet said: "Japan's huge 
current- account and trade surplus poses a problem for the 
entire world." 
  To ease trade friction with the United States, Japan is 
urged 
to open its market wider and take measures to increase domestic 
demand. At the same time, it is necessary for both countries to 
expand the scope of cooperation in tackling various issues of 
common interest in the Asia-Pacific region and the world. 
  In cooperation with the United States, Japan can play a 
greater role in promoting political and economic cooperation and 
establishing a relationship of trust in the Asia-Pacific region. 
Japan and the United States are currently cooperating in 
tackling global issues such as the environment and 
overpopulation and yielding desired results. 
  Now is the time for both countries to strengthen their 
cooperative relations from a global viewpoint to reinvigorate 
the world economy and stabilize the Asia-Pacific region.

<F P=106> [By Yoshito Horie] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 29 Mar -- A Chinese source stated on 29 
March that, despite an invitation for DPRK (North Korean) 
President Kim Il-song to visit China, President Kim does not 
intend to visit the country until the suspected nuclear arms 
development issue has been resolved. China regards Kim's 
intentions as a virtual rejection. 
  The same source analyzes that China's invitation was 
rejected 
because the DPRK is wary of the possibility that, if the issue 
should be resolved following Kim's visit, it would give the 
impression that North Korea had responded to persuasion, thereby 
giving credit to China. The "rejection" of Kim's visit 
indicates not only that North Korea is strongly aware of ROK 
President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China, but that there is a 
limit to China's influence on North Korea. 
  A party delegation that visited Pyongyang late last month 
extended an invitation to President Kim to visit to China, and 
Chinese newspapers have reported this invitation -- aimed at 
promoting an exchange of views on such issues as reform and 
opening up policies. Since the two countries are known for 
their close relationship, it was unusual for China to officially 
announce the extension of such an invitation. This fact 
indicates that China is very enthusiastic about Kim's visit. 
  Subsequently, however, China studied North Korean moves with 
caution, and reached the conclusion that North Korea feels: 
"The president's visit to China before resolution of the issue 
would probably indicate subjection to Chinese pressure and 
thereby give credit to China." In a recent interview, Chiense 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said: "There is no schedule for a 
visit in the near future." 
  At a recent special council session of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), China abstained from voting on 
reentrusting the UN Security Council with the authority on 
settling the nuclear arms development issue. At a similar 
session held last year, China voted "against" the proposal. The 
change in its position can be taken to be pressure imposed on 
North Korea. 
  China also clearly indicated opposition to sanctions by 
maintaining: "If the international community should decide to 
impose economic sanctions, there is a possibility that North 
Korea will risk its survival by attacking the ROK." Thus, it 
can be noted that China is having difficulties tackling the 
North Korean issue. 
  A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman stated on 28 March: 
"Since North Korea is a sovereign state, a foreign country 
should not instruct it to do this or that," and "even if we 
should try to persuade North Korea, there is a limit." In 
making these remarks, the spokesman must have kept these facts 
in mind.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Nowhere in Package Is Found Alternative </F>
Proposal to the `No' to the U.S. Demand"] 
  [Text] The government has decided on a package of external 
economic measures at a cabinet meeting. The government has 
stressed that the package is aimed at reducing "fully and 
significantly Japan's current account surplus in the medium 
term" through macroeconomic measures and to achieve a "robust 
and steady economic growth driven by domestic demand in the 
medium term." The government, however, has said that from now 
on, it would study concrete action programs and measures to 
achieve those goals. The package has again proven the 
government's work always focuses on quantity. 
  At the February Japan-U.S. summit talks, the Japanese side 
said "no" to the U.S. demand for setting so-called numerical 
targets, and it was the right answer to the demand. What is 
important, however, is whether the Japanese Government has 
prepared an alternative proposal to the "no" to the U.S. demand. 
  Looking at the package, it is regrettable that we have no 
choice but to conclude that the Japanese Government has not yet 
prepared such an alternative proposal. 
  There is a worrisome point in the "results-oriented trade 
policy" adopted by the U.S. Government and the policy method 
adopted by it to achieve the policy. Japan is now in a stage 
where it must take seriously the "results-oriented trade policy." 
  Japan's external surplus is conspicuous and too huge. If 
Japan's external surplus is left uncut, it may spread the trend 
of protectionist trade and managed trade all around the world. 
Japan's external imbalance is not confined to the bilateral 
issue between Japan and the United States, but is becoming a 
factor of instability in the world economic system. In other 
words, Japan can no longer continue its external imbalance. 
Hence, achieving good trade results has become a priority task 
for Japan itself. 
  It is important for Japan to map out a package of concrete 
measures to correct its external imbalance from this point of 
view. If Japan maps out a package simply as a concessionary 
response to external pressure, it may be the wrong policy, 
causing a delay in the correction of Japan's external imbalance. 
  In the course of looking for a way to correct Japan's 
external imbalance, the Japanese market will be disrupted, the 
yen will appreciate further beyond Japan's industrial 
capabilities, and Japanese enterprises will move more of their 
production overseas. If Japan's economic and industrial 
structures remain unchanged, this would hollow out Japan's 
economy. 
  What the government must do when it announces specific 
policies is to have an awareness of those issues and shape a 
reasonable strategy on the basis of its awareness. 
  What is important is the compatibility of Japanese and U.S. 
macroeconomic policies. As the United States has recognized for 
a long time, the current account imbalance between the two 
countries has come from macroeconomic factors. 
  A reversal in the growth rate between Japan and the United 
States will impede the correction of the imbalance for the time 
being. The lack of savings in the United States is a serious 
issue. U.S. measures to reduce the federal budget deficit are 
certainly generating the desired effect, and the ratio of the 
federal budget deficit to the GNP has begun to fall. 
  Nonetheless, the savings rate in the U.S. private sector has 
continued to drop. It would be meaningless if financial revenue 
and expenditure are not assessed in relation to domestic savings. 
  No individual microeconomic measure is found in the package. 
What we can find in connection with microeconomic measures is 
the expression "attempts will be made to further improve" and 
"plans will be drawn up." As for deregulation, the government 
has left it to a report to be compiled by the Administrative 
Reform Promotion Headquarters in late June. No alternative 
proposal is found anywhere in the package to "no" to the U.S. 
demand.

improve the people's quality of life. He is believed to have 
explained that the economic package is not for the sake of the

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] compiled a report on the extent economic agreements and 
accords signed between Japan and the United States have been 
implemented. While the United States strongly criticizes Japan 
for "not abiding by almost all of the agreements," MITI cites 17 
concrete cases, including beef, citrus fruit, and 
supercomputers, to refute such a charge. MITI reports: 
"Imports of beef increased by 90 percent between 1988 and 1992; 
results have been achieved in many areas." Japan intends to use 
this report as data to clear up U.S. "misunderstanding" at the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks and similar bilateral 
negotiations in the future. 
  There are around 30 agreements and accords signed between 
the 
two countries. The United States has serious doubts about 
Japan's efforts to implement these agreements, as evidenced in 
President Bill Clinton's remark during the recent Japan-U.S. 
summit talks that "despite the 30-odd agreements signed, there 
has been no change at all." MITI believes: "Such a perception 
is behind the Japan-U.S. economic friction." It has, therefore, 
engaged in an assessment of Japan's performance regarding the 
agreements. 
  Aside from beef and citrus fruit, other examples cited 
include: Agreements on medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, 
forestry products, cigarettes, computers, satellites, Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corporation's (NTT) procurement, auto 
parts, automobiles, paper, sheet glass, amorphous metal 
transformer, textiles, steel, and machine tools, and the 
Structural Impediments Initiative talks. 
  MITI emphasizes: "Japan abides by these agreements and 
accords, and visible results have been achieved." For example, 
in the case of beef and citrus fruit, as a result of abolishing 
import quotas, and implementing the agreement on tariffication, 
imports of beef grew by 90 percent, and imports of orange juice 
by 330 percent between 1988 and 1992. Imports of forestry 
products also increased by 250 percent between 1985 and 1992. 
In the case of auto parts, one of the focal issues at the 
framework talks, imports from the United States expanded from 
$6.1 billion in fiscal 1990 to $13.6 billion in fiscal 1992. 
  MITI "wants to use this to refute the United States." 
However, the report does not touch on semiconductors and car 
phones, which have been the controversial issues in recent 
weeks. This may give rise to criticism in the United States 
that the document merely cites examples to suit Japan's purpose.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Intensifying Friction Between Japan and the </F>
United States Over Air Services"] 
  [Text] The Transport Ministry has notified the United 
States it will cut the extension period of licenses for seven 
air routes to Japan operated by U.S. airlines, which expired on 
26 March, by extending them until 9 June instead of 31 October 
as requested. 
  This is a countermeasure against a similar move taken by the 
U.S. Department of Transportation. Last December, the U.S. 
department cut the extension period of licenses for six air 
routes operated by Japanese airlines from one year to 179 days, 
extending them until 9 June. The six air routes, whose opening 
was approved in a 1989 Japan-U.S. interim agreement, include a 
Tokyo-Washington route operated by Japan Air Lines [JAL] and a 
Tokyo-New York route by All Nippon Airways. A Transport 
Ministry official said: "It is unlikely the United States will 
revoke permission for Japanese airlines to extend their service 
to the United States beyond 9 June, but based on the principle 
of reciprocity, Japan has also set the expiration date at 9 
June." 
  The U.S. Department of Transportation gave notice it would 
"postpone" approval of a regular service between Sendai [in 
Miyagi Prefecture] and Hawaii, which JAL had been planning to 
inaugurate on 17 March. The notification was unusual in that it 
was made on 15 March, just two days before the opening of the 
service. The postponement did not mean the "rejection" of 
approval. But, because JAL was not allowed to operate regular 
flights on the route, it immediately asked the United States to 
allow it to fly a charter flight to carry passengers who had 
already booked seats on the scheduled flight. 
  A Transport Ministry official said: "The U.S. postponement 
of approval apparently violates the 1989 accord." Nevertheless, 
the two sides have begun attempts to reduce the other's rights 
and interests in a feud over air services. A Miyagi Prefectural 
Government official said: "We do not know why, but the U.S. 
notification came so abruptly and it caused us much trouble." 
After notification, the prefectural government canceled a visit 
to Hawaii by the governor, which was planned to promote friendly 
relations between Sendai and Honolulu. This is an unfavorable 
development in light of exchanges between Japan and the United 
States. 
  It is believed the United States has begun to take a 
hardline 
attitude as a strategy to assume the advantageous position in 
negotiations with Japan on beyond rights (which allow U.S. 
airlines to extend their routes beyond Japan to third 
countries). The two nations have long confronted each other 
over the interpretation of beyond rights. Japan asserts there 
is a great imbalance between its rights and interests over air 
services and the United States,' saying beyond rights, which 
were approved in 1952, are unequal and that a 1959 agreement 
established a framework in which the United States can freely 
increase its transportation capacity. 
  On the other hand, the United States claims it can exercise 
free and unlimited rights, including beyond rights, for flights 
to Kansai International Airport in Osaka scheduled to open in 
September. In this way, it has begun to apply pressure on Japan. 
  There is a great gap in assertions between the two 
countries. 
In aviation talks, Japan has been urged to make concessions 
while it has failed to obtain compromises from the United 
States. Even if it obtains concessions, Japan will not be able 
to use them effectively because of Japanese airlines' low 
management ability. This makes it difficult to resolve the 
aviation dispute. Nevertheless, it is not desirable for Japan 
and the United States to adopt tactics to reduce the other's 
rights and interests. The two nations should treat rights and 
interests over air services in such a way that they will be able 
to engender beneficial effects on both sides. 
  Japan and the United States will be able to reach an 
agreement on the number of air routes between the two countries, 
a precondition in settling the aviation dispute, if they 
consider passengers before anything else. Japanese airlines 
need to enhance their competitiveness so people will choose 
them. On the other hand, the United States should take 
seriously the fact it has friction over aviation with not only 
Japan, but also many other countries; and, France and Thailand 
have scrapped their aviation agreements with the United States.

  [Text] In connection with the issue of suspected nuclear 
arms development in the DPRK (North Korea), Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa said Japan would "take responsible measures 
within the scope of the Constitution," if the UN Security 
Council [UNSC] decides to impose sanctions against North Korea. 
While hoping to settle the issue through diplomatic efforts and 
avoid having to impose sanctions, the government instructed 
various ministries and agencies -- with the Prime Minister's 
Office playing the leading role--to study relevant laws and 
ordinances, taking into account the various ways the UNSC may 
consider imposing sanctions. Chinese cooperation is necessary 
within the UNSC to decide on imposing sanctions against North 
Korea. The effectiveness of sanctions also depends on China, 
which borders North Korea. For the government, however, 
studying the matter will involve constitutional issues linked to 
revisions in the security policy, and human rights issues. If 
imposing sanctions becomes a reality, serious political problems 
are expected to develop. 
<H5>  Restricting Exchanges </H5>
  Japan almost imposed sanctions on North Korea in connection 
with the 1983 incident in which terrorists tried to bomb ROK 
VIP's in Rangoon, and the 1987 incident in which an ROK airliner 
was blown up. Those sanctions consisted of four points: 1) 
Restrictions on contacts between diplomats of the two nations; 
2) prohibition, as a rule, on civil servants' visits to North 
Korea; 3) prohibition, as a rule, on entry by North Korean civil 
servants into Japan and strict screening of North Korean 
civilians regarding their entry into Japan; and 4) suspension of 
specially approved flights between Japan and North Korea. 
  This time, the government is considering the possibility of 
implementing a measure to reject reentry permits to Korean 
residents in Japan who have temporarily gone back home to North 
Korea. 
  There are approximately 700,000 North and South Koreans 
residing in Japan, of which about 200,000 are said to be North 
Koreans. Approximately 100,000 North Korean residents have 
returned there permanently since the end of the Korean war. 
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, some 15,000 North 
Korean residents visited North Korea and reentered Japan in 
1992. It is believed the majority of them "returned home" to 
visit their relatives who have remained there. In some quarters 
of the government, there are officials who strongly oppose the 
idea of refusing reentry permits, judging: "Since North Korean 
residents in Japan have been given permanent residence status, 
it would be a problem from a humanitarian point of view to 
impose restrictions on reentry permits." 
  The government is also considering plans to suspend trade 
relations. In 1992, trade between Japan and North Korea totaled 
approximately 60 billion yen. In the Foreign Exchange and 
Foreign Trade Control Law, there is a provision for placing 
trade under the control of the trade minister. As a result, the 
application of this provision has been suggested. 
<H5>  Suspension of Remittances to North Korea </H5>
  In some quarters of the U.S. Congress, deep-rooted concerns 
have been voiced about remittances to North Korea by residents 
in Japan, arguing this may be one factor contributing to the 
country's economic activity. However, the Japanese Government 
does not have a good grasp of the actual situation. 
  The government needs to revise the finance minister's 
notifications based on the Foreign Exchange Control Order [FECO] 
if it wants to "stop the remittances." The FECO says that a 
system, in which government approval is required to remit money 
abroad, can be introduced by issuing ministerial notification 
only when there are special reasons, such as UN resolutions. 
  In the past, such measures were taken when economic 
sanctions 
were imposed against Iraq and Libya. Ministry of Finance [MOF] 
officials said: "Japan can cooperate with the United Nations in 
imposing economic sanctions by adding North Korea to the 
notification list." 
  On the other hand, the government can impose restrictions 
on the flow of funds, money, carried out of the country by 
travelers. The maximum amount of money a person can carry out 
is 5 million yen. However, it seems the MOF is studying the 
possibility of strengthening checkups at ports, and of taking 
measures designed to reduce this limit for travelers going to 
North Korea by revising ministerial notifications. 
  There is no doubt that such regulations will invite 
criticism 
that it is a discriminatory policy against North Koreans living 
in Japan. After the 1987 incident, in which a Korean airliner 
was blown up, violence and threats against North Koreans 
residing in Japan became a social problem. At a news conference 
held last month, Prime Minister Hosokawa commented on how Japan 
will deal with the issue of possible sanctions against North 
Korea, saying: "We must take the human rights issue into 
consideration." He said this because of the aforementioned 
incidents. 
<H5>  Blockading the Seaborne Supply Route </H5>
  The Japanese Government believes the possibility of armed 
conflict on the Korean peninsula is currently very low. 
However, it is inevitable that military tension will rise 
should a blockade in the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea begin. 
  It is expected that most U.S. military personnel, weapons, 
military ships, and aircraft will be sent to the ROK via Japan 
to prepare for such a situation. U.S. military bases in Japan 
will have no choice but to become strong points for supplying 
fuel, ammunition, and food. 
  Article 6 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty stipulates the 
U.S. military can use U.S. military bases in Japan "for the 
purpose of contributing to the maintenance of international 
peace and security in the Far East" even when an armed attack is 
not made on Japan. The Japanese and U.S. Governments are 
expected to consult each other prior to using U.S. military 
bases for this purpose. The Defense Agency [DA] and Foreign 
Ministry interpret Article 6 to mean there are no legal problems 
in using U.S. military bases in Japan. 
  As for the issue of Maritime Self-Defense Force [SDF] ships 
joining any blockade, the majority of Japanese people think, in 
relation to the right of collective self-defense which is banned 
by the constitution, that "participation in the blockade is 
impossible unless Japan introduces a new law that is equivalent 
to the law for cooperating with UN peacekeeping operations 
(PKO)" (according to a senior DA official). 
  The issue of logistics support, and supplying food and fuel 
to U.S. military ships involved in military operations will be a 
focal point. The DA is of the view that in order to provide 
logistics support, it is necessary to clarify the SDF's power by 
revising the Self-Defense Forces Act. It seems likely that the 
issue of signing an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement 
(ACSA) with the United States will emerge. This agreement is 
required for Japan to offer transportation services, and to 
provide ammunitions and fuel to the U.S. military.

"Irresponsible Attitude of the Opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) Revealed in Tax Reform"] 
  [Text] Is a "Rough Figure" Unreliable? 
  Tax system reform has been finalized under the condition 
that 
a 6 trillion yen tax reduction is to be effected first, with the 
problem of sourcing funds to be discussed and settled later, and 
a related law enacted within this year. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa's original proposal was to abolish 
the consumption tax and to introduce, three years later, a 
7-percent welfare tax. However, the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ] strongly opposed the idea, going so far as to 
threaten to withdraw its cabinet members. So, Prime Minister 
Hosokawa had to withdraw his proposal that a tax increase and 
reduction be effected at the same time, agreeing instead that 
tax reduction be effected first. With the change in policy, the 
SDPJ was awash with victory, saying, "We won, we won." However, 
such an attitude is considered extremely irresponsible for a 
government party. Its mentality has not changed at all from the 
time when the party was permanently in opposition. 
  If a 6 trillion yen tax reduction per year is effected for 
three years, it creates an 18 trillion yen deficit in finances. 
According to a tentative Finance Ministry calculation, the 
amount of tax revenue procured by the 7-percent consumption 
tax--we may call it either a consumption tax or national welfare 
tax--is 9.5 trillion yen. Of this amount, we obtain a surplus 
of 3.5 trillion yen after deducting 6 trillion yen as the source 
of funds for the tax reduction. Concerning this figure, certain 
people claim "the Ministry of Finance intends to earn 3.5 
trillion yen by taking advantage of the consumption tax 
increase." However, this opinion is a miscalculation. To raise 
the consumption tax to 7 percent, 0.8 trillion yen is needed as 
the cost for reviewing social security expenses. Also, another 
1.3 trillion yen is needed to cover the 7-percent consumption 
tax to be assessed on goods to be procured by the government. 
Thus, only 1.4 trillion yen is to be left as a source of funds 
to cover the revenue deficit. If we repay the 18 trillion yen 
with this 1.4 trillion yen, it will take well over 10 years for 
repayment of the principal alone. A longer period is needed if 
we include repayment of the interest. What the government 
should do is to judge, taking into account the financial 
situation 10 years from now, whether the 7-percent consumption 
tax is enough, and if there is any surplus left, whether it is 
possible to further reduce the tax using the surplus as the 
source of funds. Prime Minister Hosokawa failed to explain 
these figures, saying that the 7 percent was a "rough figure," 
and was accused of being unreliable. However, even if we try to 
give a detailed explanation by piling up accurate figures, it 
will be impossible to definitely show a picture of future 
financial conditions as economic conditions change every second, 
and drastic administrative reform may take place during the 
period. A flexible attitude "to start with the 7-percent 
increase for the time being, and to review the figure as the 
situation changes" is considered necessary. It may be the prime 
minister's expression to say that the figure was "a rough 
figure." The shoes (the finances) are to be made to fit the 
feet (the economy), and it would be an absurd argument to ask 
the feet to fit the shoes. 
  The Hosokawa government compromised with the SDPJ's 
proposal, 
giving priority to avoiding the collapse of the coalition 
government. However, the SDPJ's argument has virtually carried 
over the discussion as to who is to be held responsible for the 
tax system reform. Komeito Secretary General Ichikawa asked: 
"Is the SDPJ opposed to the consumption tax itself? Is the 
party opposed to raising the consumption tax rate? Is it 
opposed to raising the tax rate now?" However, the SDPJ has not 
adequately answered these questions. 
  The party may be hoping to repeat its past wonderful 
experience of creating the [Takako] Doi [former SDPJ leader] 
boom by saying "what is not good is not good." At first, the 
SDPJ proposed "[the tax system] will be reviewed two years 
later." It must have been the SDPJ's expectation that, by so 
doing, the party could fight the House of Councilors' election 
to take place in the summer of next year with the slogans "The 
consumption tax should be abolished," or "The tax rate should 
not be raised." In that case, the election is going to be a 
ridiculous election [with the parties] flattering the masses. 
For that reason, it has been agreed, with both Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] and Komeito strongly supporting the idea, that a 
conclusion [about the tax system reform] be reached within this 
year. 
  The LDP Has Become an Irresponsible Opposition 
Party 
  It was because the people were too ignorant about indirect 
tax that the Doi boom occurred. At that time, the people were 
not even familiar with the difference between direct tax and 
indirect tax. When the Takeshita cabinet forcibly introduced the 
consumption tax, many people felt "they were cheated." Although 
the SDPJ availed itself of the situation, bringing about victory 
at the House of Councilors election, the good luck did not 
always repeat itself. Presently, public opinion survey shows 
that the ratio of the people who admit to the necessity of 
indirect taxes is as high as 60 percent. 
  The balance of national bonds issued has exceeded 200 
trillion yen. In addition to repaying the principal and the 
interest of the national debt, the government has to procure 18 
trillion yen to cover tax reduction. If we were living in a 
baby boom era, we might expect the younger generation to 
shoulder the burden. However, from now on, our society is aging 
rapidly. The big debt is to be shouldered by the working 
generation whose numbers will decrease in the future. If the 
existing tax system remains the same, it is inevitable that the 
heavy pressure will become unbearable. 
  Immediately after the birth of the Hosokawa government, 
Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the opposition LDP's Policy 
Research Council said, "If the new government intends to raise 
the consumption tax rate, we should also seriously deal with the 
problem." I was impressed by his comment, thinking that an 
opposition party ready to take responsibility was born. 
However, he recently changed his opinion that "the problem 
should be reviewed deliberately together with the problem of 
social security and the problem of pension financing." When the 
Hosokawa government was born, everyone thought it would have a 
short life. Hashimoto must have speculated that, since the LDP 
would return to power sooner or later, it would be appropriate 
to let the Hosokawa government take care of such a troublesome 
task as increasing the consumption tax rate. However, the 
Hosokawa government is assuming the aspect of a long-lasting 
government. 
  At any rate, the Hosokawa government has settled the problem 
of political reform which had been pending for six years, and 
has brought about a conclusion to the rice negotiations at the 
GATT's Uruguay Round (multilateral trade negotiations) which had 
been pending for eight years. The government also started to 
reform the tax system, although tax reduction was effected 
first. While each of the three problems can be regarded as a 
serious task for a cabinet, the government has settled as many 
as two and a half of the problems in six months. 
  After finishing all the domestic tasks the LDP had left 
undone, the Hosokawa government is about to grapple with policy 
tasks of its own, such as deregulation, administrative reform, 
and decentralization. Each of the tasks is closely related and 
should not be regarded as a separate task. Moreover, each of 
the tasks was an unsolved problem under the LDP government 
because the zokugiin [Diet members having strong influence over 
a particular ministry or agency] were involved in the process. 
The main reason behind the creation of the zokugiin was the 
medium-sized district system. The reason for the existence of 
zokugiin has also been removed through election system reform 
centered around the introduction of the single-seat district 
system. In short, the Hosokawa government is ready to start 
remodeling the state. 
  If so, what points of issue will be advantageous to the LDP 
in fighting the next general election and the House of 
Councillors' election? There seem to be many LDP members who 
are of the opinion that it is advantageous for the LDP to fight 
the elections by opposing the consumption tax increase. 
  At a meeting of the LDP's Research Commission on the Tax 
System held immediately before the budget for 1994 was drawn up, 
Chairman Tatsuo Murayama tried to coordinate opinions within the 
party along the line that "in order to operate the state of 
Japan, it is inevitable to raise the consumption tax rate to 
cover tax reduction." However, opinions were expressed one 
after another to the effect that "there is no need to dare to 
take the risk," that "it is better to have the coalition parties 
take care of the matter," and that "there is no need for an 
opposition party to take the responsibility by being involved in 
the problem to that extent," et cetera, finally making it 
impossible for Murayama to coordinate the opinions. This 
incident shows that, similar to the former SDPJ, the LDP has 
also become an irresponsible opposition party. 
  Under these circumstances, former Deputy Prime Minister 
Michio Watanabe, who advocates the necessity of "politics based 
on real intentions," expressed his pet theory on 10 February at 
a meeting of an "Economic Policy Study Group" sponsored by 
Toshio Yamaguchi and Takeo Nishioka that, "When it comes to 
economic problems, it does not matter whether the party is a 
government party or an opposition party. Consumption tax is the 
only source of funds to cover the tax reduction. I do not agree 
to making the consumption tax an objective tax." His attitude 
may be regarded as a desirable attitude for a politician. 
  Not only the SDPJ, but the LDP as well, are intently aiming 
at obtaining a popularity among the masses. The only way to 
disappoint such speculations is to settle the problem of tax 
system within this year. 
<H5>  Prime Minister Hosokawa Maintains a "Resolute Attitude" </H5>
  It is an urgent task to change the ratio of direct tax and 
indirect tax, that is, to correct the ratio between direct and 
indirect taxes. While the necessity of making the correction 
had been recognized since the time the LDP was in power, the LDP 
was actually not able to propose the correction because of its 
bitter experience of suffering a crushing defeat in the House of 
Councilors election in 1989. Though both the Kaifu and Miyazawa 
cabinets recognized the necessity of tax reduction, [they knew] 
it was inevitable to touch consumption tax if they wanted to 
effect a tax reduction. For this reason, they both carried over 
the problem saying "My cabinet does not intend to raise the 
consumption tax rate." 
  Though people say Prime Minister Hosokawa's proposal was 
made 
abruptly, the prime minister clearly expressed his intention to 
reform the tax system as soon as he assumed office. In his 
policy speech on 23 August, immediately after his inauguration, 
he stated that he was to "check the conformity of the existing 
tax system" with the needs of the aging society and with the 
change of the socio-economic conditions, and declared that 
"structuring of a tax system keeping balance between income, 
assets, and consumption" would be studied. After giving his 
speech, the prime minister asked the Research Commission on the 
Tax System (Hiroshi Kato as chairman) to study "an ideal form of 
tax system." Also, in his policy speech given at an 
extraordinary Diet meeting on 21 September last year, he stated 
that he asked the government Research Commission on the Tax 
System to study "a total reform of the tax system such as 
correction of the ratio between direct and indirect taxes, and 
other issues including reduction of income tax," and expressed 
his intention to "grapple with tax system reform" as soon as the 
commission came up with its conclusion. 
  When we look at the Hosokawa politics during these six 
months, we notice that, though the pace fluctuates, he never 
avoids what should be done. When he announced, before daybreak, 
his intention to introduce a "7-percent welfare tax" the mass 
media and the SDPJ criticized his announcement as too sudden or 
too abrupt. However, they thought the announcement was made 
abruptly simply because they failed--being absorbed in the big 
problems of rice and political reform--to realize that 
discussions about tax were underway. In the meantime, the 
government Research Commission on the Tax System submitted its 
report as scheduled, revealing that discussions were being made 
concurrently. 
  Why is it an urgent task to correct the ratio between direct 
and indirect taxes? 
  According to the settlement of accounts for 1992, the ratio 
of income tax, corporation tax, and local inhabitants tax 
(direct tax), and consumption tax, liquor tax, and tobacco tax, 
et cetera (indirect tax) was 70.7:29.3. We may roughly grasp 
the ratio as 7:3. The ratio of direct tax is the highest, and 
the ratio of indirect tax is the lowest among the 24 OECD member 
countries. The ratio between direct and indirect taxes in the 
OECD member countries averages 49.6 percent and 40.3 percent 
respectively. The remaining 10 percent is being covered with 
taxes on assets. Incidentally, the ratio of assets tax in 
Japan's total tax revenue is 13.7 percent, which is lower than 
that of England and the United States. 
  A reader opposed to the consumption tax increase once 
claimed 
in the reader's column of a newspaper that "examples in foreign 
countries should not be referred to." However, in reality, such 
a claim does not hold true. 
  Let me illustrate an international comparison of the 
minimum taxable ceiling and the rate of income tax. The minimum 
taxable ceiling in Japan is Y3.277 million [yen], whereas the 
ceiling in the United States is Y1.934 million (conversion rate: 
$1=Y124). In other words, low-income earners are also paying 
income tax [in the United States]. Among advanced countries, 
Japan's minimum taxable ceiling is the second highest after 
France. This fact may be attributable to the strong influence of 
the SDPJ as an opposition party which claimed that low-income 
earners should be taken into consideration when it comes to 
reducing tax. That the minimum taxable ceiling is high, that 
is, the lower income classes are exempted from tax assessment, 
means that the higher income classes are to be assessed 
additionally for the exempted amount. Now, comparison of the 
highest tax rates shows that, while the total rate of the 
national tax and the local inhabitants tax is 65 percent in the 
case of Japan, the rate is approximately 47 percent in the case 
of the United States. I used the word approximately because, 
while the rate of national tax is being fixed at 39.6 percent 
(the rate is 50 percent in the case of Japan), the rate of local 
inhabitants tax varies by state. If you live in a state where a 
lower rate of the local inhabitants tax is applied, the rate of 
your tax will be only about 40 percent. 
<H5>  There Are Signs That People Are Losing Their Will To Work </H5>
  Why do not golf player Ayako Okamoto and Nobel prize winner 
Professor Susumu Tonegawa come back to Japan? Though it may be 
partly because of a more comfortable environment for playing 
golf or for studying, these persons have to pay an additional 20 
percent or 25 percent tax if they come back to Japan. An Osaka 
businessman with whom I am acquainted (the name of his company 
is familiar to everyone) the other day moved to the United 
States and is "paying tax in that country." He moved to that 
country because the U.S. tax law becomes applicable to him if he 
stays in the United States for more than 180 days. It means, 
therefore, that, if a maximum tax rate is applied, our country 
is to lose extremely capable people and also the tax they are 
supposed to pay. If international exchange of goods, money, 
people, and services is further promoted, Japan will not be 
allowed to stick to its own tax laws. 
  The same thing can be said about corporation tax. The rate 
of corporation tax in Japan, with both national and local taxes 
totaled, is 49.98 percent, which is the highest next to Germany. 
The rate is 41.05 percent in the United States, and 33 percent 
in England. Because of the higher rate of corporation tax, 
Yaohan Department Store Co., Ltd., moved its head office to Hong 
Kong, where a lower rate of corporation tax is applied. 
Recently, even the Japan Communist Party [JCP] stopped arguing 
in a stereotyped way that "taxes are supposed to be assessed on 
large enterprises." Raising the corporation tax will bring 
about an emasculation of industry. 
  With the 6 trillion yen tax reduction effected recently, the 
government not only failed to reduce the maximum rate of income 
tax, but even limited the maximum amount of income tax reduction 
to Y2 million, and the maximum amount of local tax reduction to 
Y200,000. In other words, the benefit to be received by 
high-income earners through the income tax reduction to be 
effected this time will be a maximum of Y2.2 million yen. Under 
such circumstances, Okamoto, Tonegawa, and the businessman from 
Osaka will not feel like paying tax in Japan. If the situation 
remains the same, highly capable persons in every field will 
flow out to foreign countries one after another. Concerning the 
government's failure to reduce the maximum tax rate, Michio 
Watanabe severely criticized it, saying "it is a wrong idea to 
set an upper limit to the income tax reduction to avoid 
criticism that rich people are to be treated well. The 
depression cannot be overcome with an irresolute attitude." 
  If Japan is to face the aging society without changing the 
7:3 ratio between direct and indirect taxes, it is inevitable 
that the burden on workers' households will become unbearable. 
  The pension system is being operated in the form where 
workers ranging in age from 20 to 64 years support people over 
65. While 8.5 workers were supporting one aged person in 1970, 
this structure had been changed by 1990 so that 5.1 workers had 
to support one aged person. A severe situation will be created 
by 2020 when 2.1 workers will support one aged person. The 
ratio of the aged population in 1992 was 13.1 percent in Japan, 
14.6 percent in France, and 14.0 percent in Germany (the figures 
about the latter two countries are as of 1990). In the very 
near future, Japan will outpace France and Germany, and by 2020 
will rise to the highest among the advanced countries. 
Presently, the ratio between direct and indirect taxes is about 
5:5 in France, and 6:4 in Germany. Japan should change its 
ratio between direct and indirect taxes to a closer level to 
that of France and Germany where the percentage of the aged 
population is similar to that of Japan. Otherwise, it is 
evident that the direct taxes to be borne by the workers will 
become heavier. 
  The ratio of tax burden and social security burden against 
national income is called the national burden rate. In 1992, 
this rate was 38.1 percent in Japan, 51.3 percent in Germany, 
62.1 percent in France, and 52.2 percent in England. An 
excessively high national burden rate is supposed to spoil the 
will to work. In Sweden, a state with high-level welfare and 
high-level burden, the national burden rate is as high as 77.4 
percent, which means the largest portion of salaries is being 
taken away as tax. It is doubtful such a social system taking 
the form of high-level welfare and high-level burden is welcome 
to the people. 
  In 1981, immediately after the Doko-rincho [provisional 
administrative research council headed by Doko] made its start, 
a study was made "seeking an ideal form of tax burden." A study 
group was also sent to Europe. A tacit conclusion reached at 
that time was that "society becomes sick if the national burden 
rate exceeds 50 percent." The loss of the people's will to 
work, which used to be called the English disease or the West 
German disease in those days, is supposed to become apparent 
about the time the national burden rate exceeds 50 percent. 
Based on this supposition, the rincho proposed that Japan 
should keep its national burden rate "within 40 percent for the 
time being." Following the rincho, the Provisional Council for 
the Promotion of Administrative Reform also proposed that "the 
national burden rate should be below 50 percent" even in 2020 
when the aging society reaches its peak (18 April 1990). 
<H5>  Are Pensioners Weak People? </H5>
  In order to maintain balance with the international 
community, to reflect the maturity of the aging society [to the 
social welfare system], and to maintain social energy, it is 
indispensable to correct the ratio between direct and indirect 
taxes. 
  For this reason, Prime Minister Hosokawa expressed his 
straightforward policy "to correct the ratio between direct and 
indirect taxes" which had been regarded as a taboo by the LDP 
government. Originally, to reduce the tax by 6 trillion yen, it 
was thought to be enough to raise the consumption tax by about 3 
percent, making the total 6 percent. However, it became 
necessary to take into account the problem of countercyclical 
measures. An ideal form of tax system reform is to take a 
"neutral way" with tax increase and reduction to be made for an 
equal amount. However, business conditions are not stimulated 
that way. For this reason, the raise of the consumption tax 
rate was postponed for three years. In that case, the government 
has to suffer a large deficit of 18 trillion yen--6 trillion yen 
times three [years]. To cover this deficit, it is not enough to 
raise the [consumption tax] rate to 6 percent and, therefore, 
the government had to come up with the unexpectedly large figure 
of 7 percent. 
  Yet, 7 percent is still the lowest among the advanced 
countries for the rate of the value-added tax (consumption tax) 
of all the European countries is around 20 percent. 
  Although the SDPJ and Chairman Yamagishi of Rengo expressed 
their opinion that "it does not matter whether [the source of 
fund is to be procured] by the deficit financing bonds or by 
other means," it should not be allowed to take such a reckless, 
negligent, and desperate attitude. Though the SDPJ and Chairman 
Yamagishi may think they are speaking for the benefit of the 
workers, it is the younger generations who are to pay the bill 
caused by issuing the deficit financing bonds. If the bill is 
to be paid by direct tax alone, the national burden rate will 
rapidly break the danger zone of 50 percent. 
  If indirect taxes are raised, the burden will be directly 
borne by the lower-income earners who are not paying tax. 
However, it should be endured as, originally, the minimum 
taxable amount in Japan is too low. There is an argument that 
the lifestyle of pensioners will become harsh. Yet, no trouble 
is likely to be created because, if commodity prices rise due to 
the rise of the consumption tax, the amount of pension is to be 
raised automatically for the same proportion of the commodity 
price rise. In the first place, it is wrong to think that 
people living on pensions are the weak people. It is an old 
idea. We may say that, presently, Japan's pension system is the 
most satisfactory among the advanced countries. Comparison of 
the wages of the working generations and the amount of pension 
paid to the aged generations shows that, while the monthly 
take-home pay after tax of the working generations (a standard 
household) is Y244,512, the amount of pension paid to pensioners 
(a couple) is Y195,492, which is equivalent to 80 percent of the 
wages earned by the working generations (source: "Suggestions on 
the Pension System Reform" by the Ministry of Health and 
Welfare). 
  According to a survey of the actual situation of aged people 
conducted in 1973 by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, as many 
as 55.3 percent of people over 65 answered a question about 
their "real feeling of life," that "I cannot make a living." 
However, the ratio dropped to 14.5 percent in 1986. According 
to a life-consciousness survey by age group (in 1991 on 
householders), 7.9 percent of the aged people in their sixties 
answered, "It is very hard to make a living," and the ratio was 
8.9 percent for people in their seventies. Therefore, it is 
necessary to take into account the situation of these groups 
when the consumption tax rate is raised. 
  The SDPJ argues that the consumption tax should be made an 
objective tax, and Chairman Hashimoto of the Policy Research 
Commission says that "we should hold overall discussions 
including the problem of social welfare and all other problems." 
However, neither of the arguments appeals to me. If the 
consumption tax is made a tax to cover the pension, there will 
be no way to check the expansion of welfare, and Japan might 
become a high-welfare and high-burden type state just like 
Sweden. I wonder whether or not the people really want Japan to 
become such a state. 
  The problem with the existing pension system is that the 
amount of pension is raised automatically in proportion to the 
rise of commodity prices. In the 1960's, Italy introduced, 
based on the Socialist Party's proposal, an automatic pension 
slide system called "Acala mobile." However, this system, which 
proved to be merely an inflation accelerator, accelerated 
inflation and completely destroyed the Italian financial system, 
and the country had to suspend the automatic slide system when 
the Socialist Party took power in the latter half of the 1980's. 
  Presently, pensions in Japan are financed in an undesirable 
form with pensioners receiving their pension from the fund paid 
by the generations in active service, and not from the fund they 
themselves accumulated for their old days. They do not withdraw 
money from their own deposits, but are receiving money from 
their children. It is for this reason that the government is 
planning to change the age to receive pensions from 60 to 65 to 
improve the pension financing system. Yet, under the existing 
system, it will be inevitable that, in the future, Japan will 
repeat the same failure as Italy. 
  Being used to the high economic growth after the war, we 
have 
been taking it for granted that "the pension and the commodity 
price are supposed to rise." That is why the automatic slide 
system has been introduced to the pension system. If that is 
the case, it is a matter of course that the pension should also 
be reduced automatically with the decline of commodity prices. 
However, it has never been considered that wages and commodity 
prices might decline. From now on, we should change our way of 
thinking. 
  Hosokawa Politics About To Display Its Essence 
  The future annual rate of growth of the Japanese economy, 
which has grown so big, will by no means exceed two or three 
percent. If affluence is to be pursued in this situation, 
politics should, first of all, make it its major objective to 
reduce commodity prices. 
  The deregulation policy presented by Prime Minister Hosokawa 
is a very adequate policy as a first step toward creation of an 
affluent life. 
  According to the result of a commodity price survey 
announced 
in 1993 by the Economic Planning Agency, price index in Tokyo 
was 131 (New York = 100). According to a survey conducted 
around the same period by "International Economic Forum," a 
private organization in Switzerland, the price index at major 
Japanese cities averaged 159 (excluding house rent) (New York = 
100). In other words, commodity prices in Japan were 30-60 
percent higher than the international level. If commodity 
prices are as high as 160 percent in Japan, goods and money are 
supposed to rush into Japan from all over the world. While it 
is the principle of economy that if supply increases prices 
decline, it is strange that prices do not decline in Japan. Why? 
  In the first place, because of the regulations, it is 
difficult [for goods and money] to come into Japan. Also, if 
goods and money come into Japan, the price does not decline 
because of the disturbing factors involved in the distribution 
system. In Japan, the industrial fields which produce 40.8 
percent of the gross domestic product are being placed under the 
regulations, whereas the ratio is only seven percent in the 
United States. In the United States and Europe, the market is 
free in principle, with regulations placed as exceptions. In 
Japan, however, a net of regulations is being stretched over a 
huge area. There are 42 laws and 68 systems providing for 
exemption of application of the Antitrust Law. 
  The U.S. and European markets are being operated based on 
the 
philosophy that economic activities shall be free and, if evil 
influences take place such as monopoly, collusion, and price 
cartel and others, then such actions shall be severely punished 
by the Antitrust Law. In the case of Japan, on the other hand, 
it is hard to say that free competition is taking place in the 
market in view of the scandals involving the general 
contractors, the large banks' collusion in setting interest 
rates, and the practice of price cartel often exposed in the 
field of the sealing material industry and paint industry. The 
Antitrust Law should be applied more strictly. 
  The distribution market in Japan remains undeveloped because 
of the law called Large Retail Store Law. While distribution 
revolution took place in Europe and the United States 50-60 
years ago, the revolution is about to take place in Japan. 
  In short, Japan is 50 or 60 years behind Europe and the 
United States in the field of antimonopoly and distribution. 
Japan being a late starter in capitalism, there are so many 
regulations in Japan with undesirable aftereffects. During the 
war and during the postwar period of reconstruction, the 
Japanese Government and the private sector cooperated with each 
other to effectively operate the state. However, this 
cooperative line between the government and the private sector 
should have been liquidated as long as 20 years ago with Japan 
becoming a superpower. Presently, far from being cooperative, 
the collusion between the government and the private sector 
seems to be at its peak. 
  The Clinton administration has come up with the 
comprehensive 
economic framework talks based on its understanding that Japan 
is a heterogeneous state. It is because the United States does 
not regard Japan as a free market similar to Europe and the 
United States that it requests that "import targets by area 
should be shown." Against this request, Prime Minister Hosokawa 
claims that, since he is going to remove the administrative 
guidances and regulations, "it is not my intention to set up 
import targets which means that administrative guidance and 
regulations are strengthened." The Japan-U.S. talks having 
broken off, which is an unusual case, the only way left for 
Prime Minister Hosokawa is to show actual results by removing 
the regulations and establishing a fair market. 
  If deregulation is promoted on a large scale, it will 
finally 
necessitate administrative reform and decentralization which is 
the prime minister's pet project. If a free market is formed, 
there will be no trade friction and the nation's lifestyle will 
become affluent. If commodity prices decline by 30 percent, it 
means that wages are raised by 30 percent. With political 
reform having been realized, politics is ready to follow. The 
Hosokawa politics is about to display its essence. The LDP 
government showed a typical form of bureaucracy where 
politicians, bureaucrats, and business circles maintained 
collusive relations, yet, the bureaucrats actually took the 
initiative. Prime Minister Hosokawa's leadership is to be 
tested by whether he can control the bureaucrats.

<F P=106> [Interview with LDP President Yohei Kono by TOKYO SHIMBUN </F>
correspondent Makoto Ogino; place and date not given; last 
paragraph is TOKYO SHIMBUN conclusion] 
  [Text] [Ogino] What is your evaluation of the Hosokawa 
administration? 
  [Kono] They are even worse than I expected. In particular, 
they have absolutely no capability of handling economic policies 
for redressing the recession. The government's pump-priming 
package came out too late, and it will cost a lot to make up the 
loss caused by the policy failure. As for its diplomatic 
policies, the coalition destroyed the favorable Japan-U.S. 
relations that had been built up by the Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP]. The LDP cannot support such an administration. We shall 
confront them. 
  [Ogino] The LDP is taking a strong stand on the 100 million 
yen in loans to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa from the Sagawa 
Kyubin Co. Do you intend to defeat his government over this 
issue? 
  [Kono] Right now, Mr. Hosokawa's involvement in the scandal 
is the primary reason for the public's distrust of politics. 
The public will never become confident in politicians unless he 
fully explains his own position. Depending on Mr. Hosokawa's 
attitude, our party may promote campaigns to defeat the cabinet. 
We will determine our course of action depending on Mr. 
Hosokawa's attitude. 
  [Ogino] Several LDP leaders noted that the next general 
election may take place even before implementation of the new 
electoral system. What is your comment on the remarks by LDP 
members? 
  [Kono] I do not really know whether those people meant that 
the election is technically possible or whether they actually 
want to hold the election right now. But, in my opinion, there 
are still certain possibilities of such an event. 
  [Ogino] What do you say about the coalition parties' moves 
toward a realignment of political parties? 
  [Kono] A certain circle in the coalition is discussing 
interparty tie-ups without consideration for a conformity of 
policies. I wonder whether it is worth calling such moves a 
political realignment. 
  [Ogino] But even the LDP may be involved in the moves. Don't 
you think so? 
  [Kono] The coalition is just seeking its own survival 
without 
dealing with pressing political issues. The LDP has a policy to 
cope with such an irresponsible administration. We have no 
intention of listening to proposals from them. 
  [Ogino] Some of coalition parties are seeking the so-called 
great coalition with the LDP. 
  [Kono] It may be possible for us to cooperate with the 
coalition in such fields as public welfare or national security, 
but this does not mean that we can support the coalition 
government. Any temptation (from coalition parties) will never 
damage the unity of the LDP. 
  [Ogino] It appears that former Foreign Minister Michio 
Watanabe is showing a positive stand toward a tie-up with the 
coalition.... 
  [Kono] The LDP is various individuals, and members may hold 
various personal opinions. But I believe that their actual 
behavior as LDP members is another story. 
  [Ogino] Do you think it is possible that a major breakup 
will 
occur in the LDP and that some members will join some groups in 
the coalition? 
  [Kono] I think that is unlikely. The LDP is a party of 
various people who gathered under the great framework of 
liberalism, democracy, and the market economy. The LDP is 
functioning as a stabilizer of the Japanese political scene 
because it consists of wide-ranging political opinions. If the 
LDP were a more ideological and exclusionary party, the 
political scene would have been extremely unstable. 
  [Ogino] What is your plan for adjusting the LDP's lower 
house 
members to the new single-seat constituency system? 
  [Kono] The party's Internal Reform Headquarters is expected 
to formulate guidelines for the nomination of candidates in 
mid-April, and the Election Committee will prepare for election 
campaigns in line with the guidelines. I would like to prepare 
a well-planned system so that all our candidates can win. 
  [Ogino] What is your strategy for winning back power? 
  [Kono] It is very difficult to win back power when the 
Hosokawa administration maintains a high level of public 
support. However, the administration is rapidly losing its 
popularity because the public is becoming aware of its real 
nature. In particular, I am talking about the increase in its 
negative ratings. We will try our best to increase support for 
the LDP, and we must urge the Hosokawa administration to step 
down from power when it lose the support of the public. 
  At the interpellation in the beginning of the present Diet 
session, Mr. Kono clearly said that "the Hosokawa administration 
is ready to be overthrown." However, it appeared that he still 
has no strong determination to seek the dissolution of the 
administration, or the lower house at any rate. While he said 
that the breakup of the LDP would "never" occur, the party is 
likely to face rough going hereafter over party tickets for the 
next general election.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] On 27 March, Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet 
secretary and chairman of Sakigake [Harbinger], commented on 
such issues as deregulation and the controversial plan for the 
formation of a new political party while he addressed the public 
at three separate locations in Yokohama city to support an 
election campaign by a party-backed candidate running in the 
city's mayoral election. 
  Regarding deregulation plans, which are to be the 
centerpiece 
of a new market-opening package that the government plans to 
issue on 29 March, Takemura said, "Our country has created 
itself a handicap in that when it tries to import goods such as 
automobiles, rice, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical products, it 
requires much time and cost for various inspection procedures 
and paperwork." He stressed, "We must at least bring it 
(deregulation) down to the level found in other major 
industrialized nations." 
  As an example, Takemura cited inspection procedures for 
automobiles. Noting that there are many people whose jobs are 
linked to this system, while there are also people who seek its 
abolishment, the chief cabinet secretary said, "Deregulation is 
not a simple matter, but if we fail to carry it out, we cannot 
revitalize our economy, nor can our country be able to associate 
with the rest of the world on an equal partnership basis." 
  There are three candidates running in the ongoing Yokohama 
city mayoral election. One is the incumbent mayor, who is 
backed by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ], Komeito, Democratic Socialist Party 
[DSP], and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], which have all 
jumped onto the same bandwagon. The second candidate is a 
political newcomer who is being backed by Sakigake and the 
United Social Democratic Party [USDP]. The third is a newcomer 
backed by the Japan Communist Party [JCP]. 
  Regarding this election, Takemura said: "Currently, the 
general direction toward which Japanese politics is flowing is 
determined by a handful of politicians engaged in back-room 
collusive dealings. This election is an opportunity for the 
people to decide whether they approve of such practices." 
"Matters are often decided somehow through collusion, and this 
is still the situation with central government politics," he 
added. Apparently, Takemura's remarks are directed at Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro 
Ozawa, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa, and others, in 
criticizing them about how they have been proceeding with their 
plans to form a new political party, as well as a large 
parliamentary group.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Takemura Takes Reticent Attitude </F>
Toward Plans To Form a New Party -- Looks for Right Opportunity 
To Respond to Sakigake-Ousting Plans"] 
  [Text] Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura is being 
forced into a corner as the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
initiated plans to merge all of the ruling coalition parties 
into a large parliamentary group and to form a new political 
party gradually move forward within the ruling coalition 
alliance. The victory won on 27 March by the ruling 
coalition-backed candidate in the gubernatorial election in 
Ishikawa Prefecture is also expected to accelerate moves toward 
the formation of a new political party. It seems that Takemura 
has been forced to retreat in the face of the assault by 
Shinseito and other forces. However, Takemura, while continuing 
his "wait-and-see" attitude, apparently plans to respond to 
"Sakigake [Harbinger] ousting" plans which have emerged among 
some quarters of the ruling coalition parties by taking such 
steps as trying to restore his relations with Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Prior to a meeting of government and ruling coalition party 
leaders around noon on 28 March, the results of the Ishikawa 
gubernatorial election became a topic of discussion among the 
leaders. Acting Shinseito Secretary General Kozo Watanabe and 
others were jubilant over the election victory, saying, "At 
first it was said that our candidate would win by 5,000 votes, 
but later his lead increased to 10,000." In contrast, Takemura 
simply said, "The Liberal Democratic Party's [LDP] candidate 
seems to have won in all districts except for Kanazawa (if the 
results were to be tabulated under the framework of a 
single-seat constituency system)." Although this statement 
later turned out to be incorrect, Takemura somewhat cut down the 
comments of Watanabe and the others by saying, "According to the 
results of last week's poll, our candidate was supposed to win 
by a much greater margin." 
  However, Takemura has not changed his attitude about 
devoting 
himself to his official duties after a plan to reshuffle the 
cabinet was scrapped in early March. While Shinseito Secretary 
General Ichiro Ozawa has successively been contacting Diet 
members from the Japan New Party [JNP], Takemura has restrained 
himself, even when accepting requests to appear as a guest 
speaker at gatherings of supporters of JNP Diet members, to 
merely giving simple speeches at such gatherings. He may be 
trying to "respond like an adult" in order to "avoid being 
provoked by Shinseito" (as stated by a senior Sakigake official). 
  At a time when Diet deliberations on the fiscal year 1994 
draft budget remain stalled, quite a few cabinet ministers have 
expressed the opinion that politicians should refrain from 
talking about a political realignment. Officials close to 
Takemura have recommended that "it would be more beneficial at 
this time for the chief cabinet secretary to devote himself to 
carrying out his duties." 
  Moreover, it is still uncertain as to whether the 
Shinseito-initiated plans to form a "policy study 
group/parliamentary group/new political party" will take off at 
once. Takemura is thus expected to remain reticent for the time 
being and to look for the right opportunity to make a comeback.

  [Text] It was learned on 28 March that an agreement has 
already been reached between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Chief Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, 
and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa that they will 
work to form a new party under the leadership of "Hosokawa and 
Ozawa" and that as a preliminary step, they will inaugurate a 
policy study group under the same leadership before the end of 
April and call on the ruling parties to join in the group. A 
series of plans advocated by Hosokawa and others for uniting the 
ruling parties will inevitably invite criticism from the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake [Harbinger], which 
are opposed to the idea of Shinseito and Sakigake taking the 
initiative in promoting the realignment of political parties, 
because these plans have not been fully discussed by the ruling 
parties and because they include personnel issues. At a meeting 
on the night of 28 March, some members of the Japan New Party 
[JNP] expressed opposition to the idea of merging the ruling 
coalition into a new party. As such, a rift between the ruling 
parties will likely intensify. 
  On 13 March, Hosokawa, Ozawa, and Ichikawa together met with 
the independent Toshio Yamaguchi and senior JNP officials to 
discuss the issue of uniting the ruling parties into one party. 
On 18 March, Hosokawa and Ozawa continued the discussions. In 
the discussions, Hosokawa reportedly urged Ozawa and Ichikawa to 
begin work to select unified ruling coalition candidates for the 
next general election, which will be held under a combination of 
the single-seat constituency and proportional representation 
systems, and Ozawa and Ichikawa agreed to begin the work from 
April. It has also been reported that they agreed to turn the 
policy study group into a new political party at an early stage. 
  They also agreed to name the policy study group "Reform," 
which would eventually become the Reform Party, to stress the 
"continuation of reform efforts," and that membership in the 
group will be one of the criteria to be selected as a unified 
candidate. 
  They reportedly held in-depth discussions on the formation 
of 
the policy study group and a new party. It is said that 
considering the facts that the Hosokawa cabinet still maintains 
about a 50-percent approval rating and that Hosokawa is seen as 
the symbol of the change of government and the inauguration of 
the coalition government, they agreed to name Hosokawa as head 
of the group. They also confirmed that Ozawa would be in charge 
of operating the group. Also, they discussed having Ichikawa be 
put in charge of policymaking or be appointed to another 
important post. They agreed in principle on these things and 
decided to discuss further detailed personnel affairs. 
  The SDPJ, Sakigake, and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] 
are opposed to and perplexed by the quick moves by Ozawa and 
Ichikawa to firm up concrete plans to unite the ruling parties 
into one party. On 28 March, a senior DSP official said, "Our 
party intends not to allow members to participate in the group 
even as private citizens." In this way, he disclosed that the 
DSP is calling on its members to refrain from joining the group. 
  On 25 March, Hosokawa told SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama 
that "there is misunderstanding" and that "I have not instructed 
[Ozawa and Ichikawa to formulate plans to merge the ruling 
coalition into one party]." The SDPJ and other ruling parties 
are critical of Hosokawa for his insincerity because they 
believe Hosokawa has discussed with Ozawa and Ichikawa plans to 
unite the ruling parties, including personnel affairs, and that 
he is trying to cover up this fact. On 28 March, a top SDPJ 
official said: "It is unclear what the prime minister's real 
intentions are. We will never accept the plan to inaugurate a 
policy study group led by Ozawa."

  [Text] At a news conference on the morning of 29 March, 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was asked about a news report 
that an agreement has been reached between Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] Chief Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, Komeito Secretary 
General Yuichi Ichikawa, and Hosokawa that they will work to 
form a new party for which "Hosokawa would serve as 
representative and Ozawa as secretary general." In reply, 
Hosokawa denied the report, saying: "It was a complete surprise 
to me. I am greatly annoyed by that report." When asked about 
the current situation in which many reports have been circulated 
on the issue of forming a new party, Hosokawa said, "I cannot 
answer the question because I am devoted entirely to official 
business."

  [Text] The support rating for the Hosokawa cabinet has 
fallen below 50 percent. According to a poll conducted by NIHON 
KEIZAI SHIMBUN from 25 to 27 March through telephone interviews 
of 3,000 respondents, the support rate for the Hosokawa cabinet 
is 47.6 percent, falling 4.9 points from the 52.5 percent 
recorded in the previous poll in February. On the contrary, the 
percentage of pollees who do not support the administration 
increased to 31.7 percent. 
  The most number of pollees cited "lack of transparency in 
the 
policymaking process" as their reason for not supporting 
Hosokawa's government, reflecting the criticism of and 
dissatisfaction with the discord among the ruling coalition 
parties; and the abruptness of policy decisions, as evidenced by 
the national welfare tax plan, and the cabinet reshuffle fiasco. 
  Regarding the issue of the prime minister's loan of 100 
million yen from the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin trucking company, which 
is delaying deliberations on the draft fiscal 1994 budget, as 
much as 49.8 percent of respondents believed: "The prime 
minister's explanation is not convincing," and "it is dubious." 
On the other hand, 80 percent of pollees expressed the opinion 
that the Diet should deal with the budget bill immediately. 
  The Hosokawa cabinet marked a record 69.6 percent support 
rating last August, immediately after formation. Its popularity 
has declined consistently since then, falling to 52.5 percent in 
the February poll conducted after the turmoil over the national 
welfare tax plan. The percentage of non-supporters has also 
increased steadily in inverse proportion to the support rate. 
In the latest poll, this increased by 4.5 points to 31.7 
percent. Apparently, the decrease in the percentage of 
supporters is directly reflected in the increase in the 
percentage of non-supporters. 
  The top reasons cited by supporters of the administration 
(more than one answer allowed) include: "Freshness," 48.2 
percent; "because it is a non-Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
coalition administration," 41.8 percent; and "the prime minister 
is a trustworthy person," 32.4 percent. On the other hand, only 
8.6 percent said its "policies are good;" 7.8 percent 
appreciated its "coordination ability;" and 4.6 percent 
commended its "stability." 
  "Lack of transparency in the policymaking process" (53.5 
percent) topped the reasons for not supporting the Hosokawa 
administration, followed by "poor implementation ability," 49.3 
percent; "bad policies," 44.8 percent; and "lack of coordination 
ability," 40.6 percent. This seems to reflect the popular 
criticism of the prime minister's weak leadership, as seen in 
the breakdown of the Japan- U.S. summit talks, and the national 
welfare tax commotion; and discontent with the ruling coalition 
parties' bureaucrat-led policymaking process. 
  Regarding the prime minister's loan of 100 million yen from 
Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, only 6.3 percent accepted the prime 
minister's explanation as "convincing," while 35.8 percent were 
"not really satisfied" with his explanation, although they 
believed "nothing can be done under the circumstances." On the 
other hand, 36.9 percent were of the opinion that "the prime 
minister's explanation is not fully convincing," and 12.9 
percent even thought that "his explanation is completely 
dubious." This shows that while the prime minister claims he 
"has answered questions in the Diet in good faith," around half 
of the pollees doubted his explanation. 
  However, regarding the LDP and other groups' refusal to deal 
with the draft 1994 budget until they are given a satisfactory 
explanation of the 100 million yen affair, only 4 percent 
thought "refusing deliberations is the normal thing to do," and 
7.7 percent claimed "the refusal is inevitable." In contrast, 
53.1 percent expressed the opinion that "although the refusal is 
understandable, they should go into deliberations," and 27.2 
percent asserted "the refusal is unacceptable; they should go 
into deliberations immediately." This means that more than 80 
percent of pollees want Diet deliberations on the budget to 
start. 
  Concerning an increase in the consumption tax and other 
indirect taxes, 6.3 percent were "in favor," and 46.2 percent 
thought "this is inevitable as a revenue source to cover 
policies dealing with the aging society," showing a majority 
accepts the tax hike.

  [Text] During his speech in Tokyo on 28 March, Komeito 
Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa commented on the planned 
review of the Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) Cooperation Law to 
be carried out next year. He said, "I think that unfreezing 
Japan's participation in peacekeeping forces (PKF) and carrying 
out PKO, based on the five principles as efforts to contribute 
to the international community, are the limits of the national 
consensus." He further touched on the stand of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] on this issue and said: "The 
SDPJ will agree to cooperate in election campaigns for the House 
of Councilors. However, it may oppose the plan to review the PKO 
(Cooperation Law)." Thus, Ichikawa reiterated his view that the 
agreement between the coalition parties on defense, foreign 
affairs, energy, and other basic policies are indispensable 
prerequisites for the future establishment of a new-new party 
[shin-shinto] and for cooperation in election campaigns for the 
House of Councilors. 
  Ichikawa denied the possibility of dissolving the House of 
Representatives to contest a general election under the present 
multiple-seat constituency system, saying: "Some people are 
hoping for such a situation. However, we would be trampling on 
the people's will if we contest (elections) under the current 
system after the enactment of the Political Reform Law. The 
current situation will not result in the mass resignation of the 
cabinet or the dissolution of the Diet."

<F P=106> [By Harufumi Kiyota] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, 28 Mar -- It appears that the ROK Government 
has canceled its plans to resume the 1994 "Team Spirit" military 
exercises. According to a ROK Government source, the ROK has 
adopted a principle to use the resumption of the ROK-U.S. joint 
exercises as a bargaining chip for future negotiations with the 
DPRK (North Korea) over that nation's alleged nuclear weapons 
development program. ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who is 
now visiting China, is expected to fly directly to the United 
States to finalize the policy with such U.S. leaders as 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary 
William Perry. 
  On 28 March, a ROK Government source told an ASAHI SHIMBUN 
reporter the following: "The U.S. Forces Korea have already 
determined their deployment of Patriot missiles, and the 
decision will not be revised. As for Team Spirit, it may be 
resumed in April or May if North Korea decides to completely 
withdraw from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). At 
the present, however, we are undecided whether or not the 
exercises should be resumed. It depends on North Korea's future 
course of action." 
  An early resumption of Team Spirit was advocated by the ROK 
Defense Ministry when North Korea refused to fully accept 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspections, and the 
issue was brought to the UN Security Council. The ROK 
Presidential Office and Foreign Ministry are taking a positive 
stand toward the resumption but say that "the timing will be 
decided on in consultations with the United States after 
President Kim Yong-sam's trip to Japan and China." 
  Nevertheless, North Korea reacted strongly to such moves, 
stressing: "If Team Spirit is held and the IAEA maintains its 
unfair attitudes, we will withdraw completely from the NPT." 
  Now that the cold war has ended, Team Spirit is the United 
States' biggest exercise featuring emergency operations and 
field battles. To cope with the exercise, North Korea has 
always activated its armed forces and conducted large-scale 
exercises as counteractions. Moreover, even the general public 
had to put up with evacuation exercises and blackouts. Thus, 
Team Spirit has been a great burden for North Korea.

  [Text] ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu expressed his 
hopes about China's influence on the DPRK (North Korea) over 
that nation's alleged nuclear weapons development program. On 
29 March, Foreign Minister Han stopped over at Narita Airport on 
the way from Beijing to the United States, and during the brief 
stop, he met with a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN correspondent at an 
airport hotel. He said that "we would like to place our hope on 
China's persuasive power with North Korea." Referring to his 
U.S. visit, he said that he intends to meet U.S. Government 
leaders to discuss the two nations' future stands toward North 
Korea. He added, in particular, that the U.S.- ROK 
consultations will focus on the possibility of UN Security 
Council resolutions against North Korea in line with the results 
of the Japanese-ROK and Chinese-ROK summit talks. 
  As for China's desirable role in the nuclear issue involving 
North Korea, Foreign Minister Han stated: "Just like Japan, 
China has an important role in this issue. We would like to 
place our hopes on China's persuasive power with North Korea, 
while we still do not know how effective this actually will be." 
  Foreign Minister Han had been visiting China as the deputy 
leader of the ROK delegation led by President Kim Yong-sam, and 
he is heading for the United States straightaway. After his 
U.S. visit, he is scheduled to again visit Japan on 3 April and 
to meet with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and other Japanese 
leaders.

  [Text] Dear listeners: U Myint Maung, a cabinet member of 
the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma [NCGUB] 
who holds the portfolio of agriculture and forest, is reported 
to be missing while traveling in Thailand. Democratic Voice of 
Burma, DVB, has received the following report. 
  U Myint Maung, minister of agriculture and forest of the 
NCGUB, has been missing. He was returning from Chiang Mai to 
Bangkok on 25 March 1994. U Myint Maung, an elected 
representative from Einme Township constituency-2, Irrawaddy 
Division, went missing after he failed to arrive in Bangkok on 
26 March as scheduled. 
  Although the disappearance of Minister U Myint Maung is 
being 
investigated, no confirmed news has so far been received. 
  In similar circumstances, NCGUB Finance Minister U Win Ko 
and 
Information Minister U Hla Pe were assassinated while traveling 
in 1993. While traveling on official duty, Finance Minister U 
Win Ko last contacted Bangkok from Kunming, China, on 27 
February 1993. Three days later on 2 March, Minister U Win Ko 
was found dead with two knife wounds in Room No.41 of the Green 
Garden Hotel in Kunming. Furthermore, Information Minister U Hla 
Pe went missing on 16 June 1993 while traveling in Bangkok, 
Thailand. A few days later, his corpse was discovered with 
gun-shot wounds. There is a possibility that the assassination 
of the two ministers is the work of the State Law and Order 
Restoration Council. 
  A reliable source says continued investigations are underway 
on the disappearance of Minister U Myint Maung.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Rangoon Burma Television Network in 
Burmese at 1300 GMT on 28 March carries a 63-minute report on 
the 28 March plenary session of the National Convention on 
drawing up the basic principles for drafting the new 
constitution, which was held in the Central Meeting Hall of the 
President's Residence compound on Ahlone Road, Rangoon. The 
reports includes recorded extracts of the proposal papers read 
by nine delegates from the special invitees and political 
parties group. 
  First, U Aung Hkam Ti, a Pa-o national of the Southern Shan 
State Special Region-6, reads the report which describes the 
ethnic origin and language of Pa-o nationals. Elaborating on 
the basic principle prohibiting secession from the Union, he 
notes the secession clause in the Soviet Constitution which has 
led to the current disintegration of the Soviet Union and points 
out "the need to prevent any opportunity for secession." 
Therefore, he proposes to include a clause in the constitution 
which will prohibit any region, state, self-administered 
division, and self-administered zone from seceding from the 
Union. The report then points out the weakness of a system of 
government led by a prime minister and proposes a presidential 
system of government. He concludes the report by calling upon 
other groups of delegates to strive to make the constitution 
more complete through their proposals. 
  Next, U Aik Mone of the Northern Shan State Special 
Region-7, 
reads the report of the group, describing the ethnic origin, 
language, culture, and traditions of the Ta-ang Palaung 
nationals and their involvement in the tea industry and 
agriculture. He explains that the Ta-ang Palaung prefer to call 
themselves Ta-ang. He estimates that the congruous territory 
inhabited by Ta-ang Palaung covers: "1. the vicinity of and 
within Mogok Township in Mandalay Division; 2. the vicinity and 
the town of Kyaukme in Kyaukme Township, where Ta-ang Palaung 
constitutes 60 percent of the township population; 3. the 
western and northern parts of Hsipaw Township; 4. Namtu 
Township, where 70 percent of the population are Ta-ang Palaung; 
5. Mong Mit Township, where Ta-ang Palaung constitute 40 
percent of the township population; 6. Kutkai Township, where 
50 percent of the population is Ta-ang Palaung; 7. Namhkam 
Township, where Ta-ang Palaung constitutes 70 percent of the 
population; 8. Namhsan Township in Northern Shan State, where 
90 percent of the population is Ta-ang Palaung. The population 
of about 600,000 Ta-ang Palaung live collectively in this 
congruous territory." Furthermore, there are Ta-ang Palaung 
living in Lashio, Tangyan, Mu-se, and Mong Hsu townships in the 
Northern Shan State; Kalaw, Aungban, Lawksawk, and Ywagnan 
townships in the Southern Shan State; and Keng Tung, Mong Hkak, 
Mong Hsat, and Mong Ping in the Eastern Shan State." 
  The report proposes that, in consideration of their desire 
to 
live peacefully with their own language, literature, culture, 
customs, and traditions, it is proposed that the Ta-ang 
nationals be made the "Ta-ang self-administered division," that 
the term "Ta-ang be used instead of Palaung," that "the Mong 
Tung region be declared a grade-1 level township, and the Mong 
La region be declared Mong La grade-1 level township." 
  He expresses support for the undertakings of the government 
for development of the border regions. In conclusion, he calls 
on the delegates to consider his proposals with patience and 
magnanimity. 
  Next, U Kyaw Myint alias U Win Maung of Namhkam presented 
his 
proposal in his capacity as chairman of the Khulon Lishso 
National League. He says the real ethnic name of his group is 
not Lisu but Lihso, and explains the existence of various groups 
of Lihso. He says most of the Khulon Lisu of Lihso live in the 
northern parts of Shan State and they are spread throughout 
Myanmar [BurmaBurma Television Network Burmese 
  Next, U Khin Maung, member of the Central Executive 
Committee 
of the National Unity Party [NUP], continues reading the NUP 
report. He says the status of self-administered divisions and 
self-administered zones should be given if the following 
requirements are met: "A. a national race which has not 
obtained the status of region or state; B. an appropriate size 
of population; C. a collective inhabitation in a congruous 
territory; D. having a territory which includes existing 
townships that can be formed into at least two districts." He 
says delicate ethnic issues in the country should be settled 
with love, consideration, trust, and under the principle of 
racial harmony. He also calls for consideration of the level of 
economic development, administrative skill, communications, 
racial background, religion, language, customs, and traditions 
in deciding on the ethnic issue. He proposes the "prescription 
of self-administered zones and self-administered divisions in 
the appropriate areas within the regions and states." He then 
refers to the existence of Wa, Kokang, Pa-o, Palaung communities 
in the Shan State and Naga communities in Sagaing Division and 
says they should be entitled to self- administered area status. 
  Next, the report of the the Union Pa-o National Organization 
is read by U Aung Khin. He welcomes the efforts to upgrade the 
political status of national races by giving them 
self-administration under the new constitution. He stresses 
"the time has now come to give the status of self-administered 
divisions and self-administered zones to national races who have 
not yet obtained their own state." He explains that Ho-pang 
meets the requirement for population and congruous territory and 
calls for its recognition as "a self-administered division for 
the Pa-o." He suggests that the constitution should include a 
provision prohibiting secession. 
  Addressing the chapter on the head of state, he proposes 
that 
the electoral college be composed of three groups from two 
chambers of Parliament to elect a president and two presidents. 
  The plenary session goes into recess at 1350. When the 
session resumes at 1420, U Ti Dar Wai of the Shan State Kokang 
Democratic Party reads his party's paper. He says that "Kokang 
nationals would like to have the status of a self-administered 
division where they can live lawfully with their own literature, 
language, culture, and customs and that they would like to live 
in peace and freedom under a stable political system formed 
along democratic lines which fully guarantees human rights." He 
defines "the original size of the territory of Kokang 
self-administered zone as an area composed of the (Wetmauk) and 
(Kongtha) townships, which existed under the old constitution." 
He then discusses the principles for determining the status of 
a self-administered division and self-administered zone. He 
proposes that, like Kachins, who already have their own state, 
other national races should have their self-administered 
division or zone in other states and regions and that national 
races like Kokang, Wa, Pa-o, Mro or Khami, Palaung, Lihso, Naga, 
Lahu, and Akhar should be entitled to a self-administered 
division or self- administered zone. 
  Continuing, he proposes that "the constitution includes a 
provision to recognize the peacekeeping force [nyein-chan-ye 
tat-phwe] as a legitimate people's armed peacekeeping force in 
order to provide national security, security of a respective 
self- administered division or self-administered zone, 
protection of the life and property of the people, and 
protection for the democratic system." 
  Next, the proposal paper of the Mro or Khami National 
Solidarity Organization is read by its representative, U Tha Pan 
Aung, of Rakhine State's, Buthidaung Township. He points out 
the weakness of the 1947 Constitution, which contains divisive 
provisions for national races. 
  Continuing, he expresses the belief that the granting of a 
self- administered zone or self-administered division should not 
be based on population and territory alone, but also based on 
the historical background of the races concerned. He explains 
that Mro or Khami nationals live in the northern part of Rakhine 
State and some areas of the Chin Hills. He says the Mro or 
Khami would like to live collectively in an area as they have 
done in the past. Therefore, he proposes an area consisting of 
some townships because of threats from insurgents. The 
population of Lihso is estimated to be about 70,000 and most of 
the Lihso -- about 40,000 -- live around the Namhkam-Kutkai 
mountain range. He asks the alternate chairman to consider 
whether the Lihso living in Namhkam-Kutkai area are entitled to 
self-administered zone status and to consider the alternative if 
the group is not entitled to the status. He says his group is 
prepared to abide by the decision of the national convention. 
He admits he cannot say whether his presentations are relevant 
to the chapter on state structure and asks the national 
convention to either put them on record or insert them under an 
appropriate chapter heading. 
  Next, special invitee delegate U Myint Lwin alias U Wan 
Twetar from Kutkai Township, representing the Lun nationals from 
Northeastern Burma, presents his proposal. He explains the 
loyalty of the Lun ethnic group to the country and proposes that 
the "Lun national race be added to the list of national races 
when the constitution is promulgated". He says he is prepared 
to be abide by the decision of the National Convention. 
  Next, U Tun Yi, general secretary of the National Unity 
Party, presents his party's report, which suggests: "1. Myanmar 
is a sovereign independent democratic republic; 2. the state 
shall be called the Republic of the Union of Myanmar; 3. the 
Republic of the Union of Myanmar is a nation where leaders of 
national races with equal status have lived eternally in harmony 
and unity; 4. the sovereign power of the state stems from the 
citizens and reside in the entire country; 5. the legislative, 
administrative, and judicial powers which stem from the citizens 
and the central organs of state power which represent the 
citizens and which are established in accordance with the 
constitution are to exercise these powers according to law. 
Civil service organizations or a single civil service personnel 
delegated by the central organs of state power shall be able to 
legally utilize these powers;" "6. the territory of the 
Republic of the Union of Myanmar shall be the land, sea, and 
airspace which constitute its territory on the day the 
constitution is adopted." 
  Next, U Khin Maung, member of the Central Executive 
Committee 
of the National Unity Party [NUP], continues reading the NUP 
report. He says the status of self-administered divisions and 
self-administered zones should be given if the following 
requirements are met: "A. a national race which has not 
obtained the status of region or state; B. an appropriate size 
of population; C. a collective inhabitation in a congruous 
territory; D. having a territory which includes existing 
townships that can be formed into at least two districts." He 
says delicate ethnic issues in the country should be settled 
with love, consideration, trust, and under the principle of 
racial harmony. He also calls for consideration of the level of 
economic development, administrative skill, communications, 
racial background, religion, language, customs, and traditions 
in deciding on the ethnic issue. He proposes the "prescription 
of self-administered zones and self- administered divisions in 
the appropriate areas within the regions and states." He then 
refers to the existence of Wa, Kokang, Pa-o, Palaung communities 
in the Shan State and Naga communities in Sagaing Division and 
says they should be entitled to self- administered area status. 
  Next, the report of the the Union Pa-o National Organization 
is read by U Aung Khin. He welcomes the efforts to upgrade the 
political status of national races by giving them 
self-administration under the new constitution. He stresses 
"the time has now come to give the status of self-administered 
divisions and self-administered zones to national races who have 
not yet obtained their own state." He explains that Ho-pang 
meets the requirement for population and congruous territory and 
calls for its recognition as "a self-administered division for 
the Pa-o." He suggests that the constitution should include a 
provision prohibiting secession. 
  Addressing the chapter on the head of state, he proposes 
that 
the electoral college be composed of three groups from two 
chambers of Parliament to elect a president and two presidents. 
  The plenary session goes into recess at 1350. When the 
session resumes at 1420, U Ti Dar Wai of the Shan State Kokang 
Democratic Party reads his party's paper. He says that "Kokang 
nationals would like to have the status of a self-administered 
division where they can live lawfully with their own literature, 
language, culture, and customs and that they would like to live 
in peace and freedom under a stable political system formed 
along democratic lines which fully guarantees human rights." He 
defines "the original size of the territory of Kokang 
self-administered zone as an area composed of the (Wetmauk) and 
(Kongtha) townships, which existed under the old constitution." 
He then discusses the principles for determining the status of 
a self-administered division and self-administered zone. He 
proposes that, like Kachins, who already have their own state, 
other national races should have their self-administered 
division or zone in other states and regions and that national 
races like Kokang, Wa, Pa-o, Mro or Khami, Palaung, Lihso, Naga, 
Lahu, and Akhar should be entitled to a self-administered 
division or self-administered zone. 
  Continuing, he proposes that "the constitution includes a 
provision to recognize the peacekeeping force [nyein-chan-ye 
tat-phwe] as a legitimate people's armed peacekeeping force in 
order to provide national security, security of a respective 
self-administered division or self-administered zone, protection 
of the life and property of the people, and protection for the 
democratic system." 
  Next, the proposal paper of the Mro or Khami National 
Solidarity Organization is read by its representative, U Tha Pan 
Aung, of Rakhine State's, Buthidaung Township. He points out 
the weakness of the 1947 Constitution, which contains divisive 
provisions for national races. 
  Continuing, he expresses the belief that the granting of a 
self- administered zone or self-administered division should not 
be based on population and territory alone, but also based on 
the historical background of the races concerned. He explains 
that Mro or Khami nationals live in the northern part of Rakhine 
State and some areas of the Chin Hills. He says the Mro or 
Khami would like to live collectively in an area as they have 
done in the past. Therefore, he proposes an area consisting of 
some townships in the northern Rakhine State and (?Falam) as a 
self-administered division for Mro or Khami. 
  Addressing the issue of head of state, he proposes that the 
electoral college for electing the president and two vice 
presidents be composed of all members from the two chambers of 
Parliament. 
  The plenary session ends at 1540.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- U.S. Ambassador to Japan 
Walter Mondale said Wednesday [30 March] he is "disappointed" 
with Japan's new market-opening package designed to help ease 
trade tensions between the two nations. 
  Speaking to a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of 
Commerce in Japan (ACCJ), Mondale said there is "virtually 
nothing" which can significantly reduce Japan's current account 
surplus in the Japanese package unveiled the previous day. 
"There is not a stimulation at all" for the Japanese economy in 
the program, he said. 
  Japan announced Tuesday a new package of measures to further 
open its markets to foreign products in a bid to bring down its 
towering trade surplus with the rest of the world, the United 
States in particular. The package offers, however, no fresh 
proposals on macroeconomic measures, although it promises to 
come up with concrete plans for comprehensive tax reform by the 
end of June. 
  The program is a "very generalized statement of steps that 
will be taken down the road," Mondale said. He was also 
dissatisfied with plans for further deregulation featured in the 
package, calling them "very vague" and "very difficult to 
analyze." 
  His remarks reinforced criticism expressed overnight by U.S. 
Officials, including U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, 
who said the package has failed to meet U.S. concerns. 
  Mondale said the package cannot justify the resumption of 
the 
Japan-U.S. "Framework" trade talks aimed at slimming the 
bilateral trade surplus. 
  The Japanese package is designed to show Tokyo's commitment 
to reducing its surplus and help break the impasse in the 
framework negotiations, which broke down in February. 
  He indicated the possibility that Washington may resort to 
trade sanctions unless Japan works to bring down its surplus. 
  "We very much hope (sanctions) won't be necessary. But we've 
also said we cannot live with the status quo." 
  The U.S. ambassador said much should be done, particularly 
in 
the auto and auto components, one of the key areas covered by 
the framework trade negotiations. "Basically, we have a closed 
market here," he said, citing heavy import taxes and tight 
inspection requirements as examples of the obstacles hampering 
sales of U.S. cars in Japan. 
  If progress cannot be made in this central area, he said, it 
is very hard to see how overall progress can be made in the 
framework talks. 
  Mondale also said the U.S. does not intend to specifically 
instruct Japan about what it should do to boost domestic demand 
because giving specifics is "perhaps improper." 
  "We do not come to Japan to say, `here is the American tax 
program you are putting into place,"' he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- Japan will strive to come 
up with more concrete measures to further open its markets by 
the end of June to help conclude stalled bilateral trade talks 
with the United States, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura said Wednesday. "It is enormously important for the 
Japanese Government to put all its energy into compiling such 
measures in June, because the U.S. is focusing on our June 
package," the top government spokesman told a news conference. 
  Takemura's comment came after U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor rejected as inadequate a fresh Japanese 
market-opening package unveiled Tuesday. "We have reviewed 
these measures and they do not meet (our) concerns," Kantor said 
at a White House news conference Tuesday. 
  Takemura said Kantor's negative assessment of the Japanese 
package is regrettable. But he also expressed hope for an early 
resumption of the stalemated "framework" trade negotiations 
saying he is paying attention to Kantor's remark suggesting 
there remain possibilities of resuming the bilateral trade talks 
if Japan makes further concessions. 
  Kantor said, "we are not discouraged. The Government of 
Japan has described this as a first step and we see it as a work 
in progress." 
  On Tuesday, Japan announced a set of market-opening measures 
designed primarily to pare down its lopsided trade surplus with 
the U.S., which amounted to some 60 billion dollars last year. 
  The package features tax cuts and other macroeconomic steps 
to spur domestic demand, market-opening measures in four sectors 
and voluntary overtures in three priority areas of the trade 
talks with the U.S. 
  The chief cabinet secretary denied that Tokyo plans to send 
a 
special envoy to Washington to officially explain Japan's 
efforts to boost foreign access to its markets and slash its 
trade surpluses.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- The strong yen has been 
reflected in prices of imported goods, the Finance Ministry and 
the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) reported Tuesday [29 March]. 
The report, based on a survey of price movements in March, said 
import prices at customs clearance declined in 24 of 30 items 
surveyed, while retail prices dropped in 15 of 17 items. 
  Retail prices of imported beef dropped 14 percent, compared 
with February, it said. 
  EPA officials said the survey showed that the decline of 
import prices declared at customs clearance was reflected in 
retail prices. 
  The officials said prices of wine imported from France in 
February were down 37.8 percent compared with a year earlier. 
  Prices of frozen octopus and Italian-made dress shirts have 
declined around 30 percent from the year before, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- The Transport Ministry on 
Tuesday [29 March] announced a plan to double the number of 
Japanese tourists to the United States to 6.8 million by 2000 as 
part of efforts to reduce Japan's swollen current account 
surplus with the U.S. Ministry officials said the government 
hopes to conduct negotiations with the U.S. on specific measures 
if Washington agrees to the plan. 
  Japan posted a tourism account deficit of 10 billion dollars 
with the U.S. in fiscal 1992, while recording a trade surplus of 
four times as much. 
  Under the plan, the tourism deficit is expected to double to 
20 billion dollars to help reduce Japan's current account 
surplus, the officials said. 
  The ministry had hoped to incorporate the plan in the 
package 
of macroeconomic measures the government announced earlier 
Tuesday to open Japan's markets and spur domestic demand, but 
failed to do so because of policy differences within the 
government, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- The Construction Ministry 
will conduct hearings on housing makers and other related 
industries on Japan's regulations on imports of houses and 
construction materials, Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi said 
Tuesday [29 March]. Igarashi told a press conference after the 
day's cabinet meeting that the ministry will call executives of 
housing makers, contractors, and trading houses in early April 
to hear their opinions on the restrictions. 
  The results of the hearings will be referred to when the 
ministry works out deregulatory steps in these areas. 
  Easing of the curbs on housing imports is viewed as a 
necessary step to bring down Japan's relatively expensive house 
building costs. The ministry has drafted an action plan to 
reduce the Japanese costs by one-third by 2000.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- The Philippines' 
parliamentary leader Jose de Venecia told Japan's Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa that the six member states of the Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are concerned about North 
Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development program. De 
Venecia, speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives, 
made the remark in a brief meeting with Hosokawa at his official 
residence, a Foreign Ministry official said. 
  Hosokawa told De Venecia that he had reaffirmed the mutual 
concern over Pyongyang's alleged nuclear development with 
leaders of China and South Korea earlier this month, the 
official said. 
  ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, 
Singapore and Thailand. 
  Hosokawa, touching on his brief encounter with Philippine 
President Fidel Ramos in Seattle last November, expressed hope 
he will have the opportunity to talk with him for longer at this 
year's summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in 
Indonesia in November, the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- More than one-third of 
about 680,000 Korean residents in Japan are members of the 
pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan 
(Chongnyon), the head of the Justice Ministry's Public Security 
Investigation Agency said Wednesday [30 March]. 
  Shigetake Ogata, speaking to the House of Representatives 
Budget Committee, said that about 247,000 Korean residents are 
Chongnyon members, including 56,000 in Chongnyon affiliates, 
while 369,000 are members of the pro-Seoul Korean Residents 
Union in Japan (Mindan). Ogata also said that 63,000 Korean 
residents profess to be neutral. 
  According to the Justice Ministry's Immigration Bureau, 
about 
688,000 Koreans were living in Japan in 1993. The agency 
determined the breakdown of statistics through figures provided 
by the agency's offices in each prefecture. 
  Regarding the sending of money to North Korea by 
pro-Pyongyang Korean residents, Ogata said that the residents 
send the money through a number of routes, including trade 
payments, remittances to relatives and friends in North Korea, 
and joint business ventures, and donations to the Korean Workers 
Party [Workers Party of Korea] and government organizations. He 
added that some of the money, estimated to be between 60 billion 
and 80 billion yen, is sent through banks or taken along by 
residents visiting North Korea. 
  The issue of Korean residents sending money to North Korea 
has gathered attention with increasing talk of economic 
sanctions against Pyongyang for refusing to permit full 
inspections of nuclear facilities suspected of being part of a 
secret atomic weapons plan.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- Bangladesh's Prime Minister 
Begum Khaleda Ziaur on Wednesday [30 March] highlighted "bright 
new opportunities" for trade and investment in her country and 
called for greater economic cooperation with Japan based on 
"common Asian aspirations." Ziaur, speaking at a luncheon 
hosted by Japanese economic organizations, presented Bangladesh 
as "an attractive country for foreign investors" and urged 
Japanese investors and traders to visit the country themselves 
and "make your own judgment." 
  Meanwhile, she called on the Japanese Government to offer 
better market access opportunities for Bangladesh goods and 
services, noting that the bilateral trade balance is weighted 
"heavily in favor of Japan." 
  Ziaur, who arrived in Tokyo on Monday for a five-day 
official 
visit, said Bangladesh products are very competitive in terms of 
price and quality, while they enjoy special and preferential 
market access facilities in major world markets. She cited such 
examples as jute, ready-made garments, leather goods, rice and 
tea. 
  Two-way trade between the two countries in 1993 totaled 
about 
400 million dollars. 
  Japanese investments in Bangladesh by the first half of 1992 
had numbered 40, totaling about 130 million yen. But this 
represented only 0.2 percent of all Japanese investment in Asia. 
  Recognizing that some potential investors still harbor 
doubts 
about her country, Ziaur sought to dispel them by portraying 
what she called "the true image of present day Bangladesh." 
  "Lack of proper information and a clear understanding about 
a 
country can naturally cause a degree of reservation in the minds 
of those who are looking for new business opportunities," she 
said. 
  Ziaur noted Bangladesh's location in a South Asian market of 
more than one billion customers, growing confidence in the 
economy shown by major international financial institutions, the 
substantial growth of export industries in the country in recent 
years, the establishment of export processing zones and an 
emerging stock market. She also cited the stability and 
convertibility of the local currency, full repatriation of 
profit and various investment incentives. 
  "Bangladesh is poised for a new phase in industrial 
development," she proclaimed. "Our industrial policies are 
built around the central role of the private sector, our economy 
is now fully market-friendly (and) our trade is fully 
liberalized."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's plan to form a policy study group involving all the 
ruling coalition partners will be put off to avoid a split in 
the coalition, according to political sources. A senior 
official of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a key member of the 
seven-party coalition, said Tuesday night the party must rethink 
the proposal but said the basic concept has not changed. 
  A senior official of Komeito, another coalition party which 
backs the plan, also said the study group could not be formed at 
the present juncture. 
  Shinseito, Komeito and the Japan New Party led by Hosokowa 
have agreed to establish a policy study group next month with 
the aim of ultimately merging all of the coalition parties into 
a single party. 
  But Tomiichi Murayama, leader of the Social Democratic Party 
[of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest force in the coalition, 
Tuesday expressed opposition to the plan. Murayama told 
reporters that if joining the study group is a condition to be 
selected as a joint candidate under the new electoral system for 
the House of Representatives or if the group is designed to 
create a new party, he "would not be able to agree" to let SDPJ 
legislators participate. 
  Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) Chairman Keigo Ouchi said 
Tuesday coalition members should not rush to join the study 
group, which he said is based on a scheme to create a new party. 
  "Joining the group as individuals could lead to a collapse 
of 
the political party," he said. "There is no chance that the DSP 
will participate in the group en masse under the current 
circumstances."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- The ruling coalition on 
Wednesday decided to hold a fence-mending meeting of top 
officials in early April to repair strained relations among the 
partners after calling off a scheme for creating a new party, 
coalition sources said Wednesday. Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's plan to establish a policy study group of coalition 
legislators as the launching pad for a new party was shelved 
after the scheme threatened to topple the fractious coalition. 
  Policy-making executives of the coalition partners set a 
meeting of representatives on Monday for improving soured 
relations among the coalition partners after the plan drew 
criticism from two of the seven ruling parties, the Social 
Democratic Party [SDP] and new party Sakigake [Harbinger]. 
  The plan was being ambitiously pursued by Hosokawa, along 
with the coalition's two strategists Ichiro Ozawa, secretary 
general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], and Yuichi Ichikawa, 
secretary general of the Buddhist-backed Komeito [Clean 
Government Party]. 
  The study group would have set the stage for merging the 
seven coalition parties into a single party with possible 
participation by some members of the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party. The coalition partners who had pushed for the 
plan pointed the need for closer policy coordination among the 
members. 
  Ichikawa, speaking at a meeting of Komeito legislators 
Wednesday, said, "There still remains the need to enhance the 
sense of policy unification among the coalition partners." 
"There will be no cooperation over elections without unity on 
policy," he said. 
  Shinseito's deputy secretary general, Kozo Watanabe, who 
spoke at a meeting of party executives the same day, called for 
a grouping that everybody can join freely. "We need to 
cooperate toward creating a united party," he said. 
  Takashi Yonezawa, general secretary of the Democratic 
Socialist Party (DSP), also a coalition partner, joined the 
chorus of calls for continued efforts toward creating a new 
party. 
  Yonezawa said the DSP should play an active role along with 
Hosokawa's Japan New Party and Sakigake in establishing a forum 
for discussing policy coordination in view of fielding joint 
candidates in coming national elections under the new election 
system. 
  The move toward a new party was accelerated after Hosokawa 
pushed through a political reform package in January, replacing 
multi-seat districts with single-seat constituencies in general 
election for the House of Representatives. 
  But the initiatives by Hosokawa, Ozawa and Ichikawa have met 
strong antagonism from the SDP, the largest bloc in the 
coalition, and new party Sakigake led by Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura. 
  Koken Nosaka, chairman of the SDP's Diet Affairs Committee, 
said at the meeting of top coalition officials that making 
participation in the proposed study group preconditioned on 
supporting joint coalition candidates for elections could lead 
to a split in the coalition. 
  Meanwhile, Toshio Yamaguchi, an independent member of the 
House of Representatives, who has been a major proponent for the 
scheme, said at a press conference that the plan for an 
interparty study group is still alive. He said he wants to 
start a preparatory committee for the group by the end of April. 
  But a senior Komeito member said, "The situation is already 
beyond the power of Mr. Yamaguchi."

  [Excerpt] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- Prosecutors indicted 
former Kajima Corp. Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama on Tuesday 
[29 March] on a charge of bribing a former Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) legislator to seek his influence in pressuring the 
Fair Trade Commission [FTC] over a bid-rigging case involving 
Kajima. The indictment said Kiyoyama handed over a 10 million 
yen bribe to former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura on 
January 13, 1992, asking him to pressure then FTC Chairman 
Setsuo Umezawa not to file a criminal accusation against a 
now-disbanded, 66-company "bid-rigging consultation" group in 
Saitama Prefecture, of which Kajima was a key member. 
  Nakamura, 44, was an acting chairman of the LDP's lobby of 
legislators concerning the Antimonopoly Law at the time he 
allegedly complied with Kiyoyama's request, it said. 
  Kiyoyama, 68, is currently standing trial on a separate 
charge of bribing Fujio Takeuchi, former governor of Ibaraki 
Prefecture, to secure his political influence in pressuring the 
local government to award a public works project to Kajima. 
  Kiyoyama's indictment over the FTC affair followed a 
decision 
earlier in the day by the nation's top prosecutors to indict 
both Nakamura and Kiyoyama on bribery charges, investigative 
sources said. However, the prosecutors decided to defer 
Nakamura's indictment until Friday, when his court-authorized 
20-day detention runs out, the sources said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Wednesday [30 March] defended himself against 
opposition claims that he obtained 100 million yen as an 
unreported political donation from a trucking firm at the center 
of a payoff-and-mob scandal. 
  The fact that Hosokawa offered to the Sagawa Kyubin trucking 
group his vacation house in Yugawara, Kanagawa Prefecture, as 
collateral and later had the company return the collateral shows 
that he repaid the loan, the premier told a Diet session. "The 
very fact that I pledged (the vacation house) as collateral and 
later had the collateral lifted proves that I repaid the loan, 
rather than obtaining the money as a donation," Hosokawa told 
the House of Representatives Budget Committee. 
  "Sagawa Kyubin's records of credits also show that I repaid 
the loan completely," he said. Hosokawa made the remarks in 
reply to Hiroyuki Nagahama, a Sakigake [Harbinger] legislator 
from the governing coalition. 
  Under Japanese law, repayment of a loan is not a 
prerequisite 
for having a creditor remove a borrower's collateral from a 
Justice Ministry register. It only requires consent of a lender 
to have the collateral cleared. 
  Hosokawa has repeatedly told the Diet that he put up both 
the 
vacation house and a state-of-the-art sword guard as collateral 
in securing the 100 million yen "loan" in September, 1982. 
  He said he needed the money to finance the purchase of a 
condominium in Tokyo's posh Moto-Azabu area as well as to fix 
the gate and wall of his mansion in Kumamoto Prefecture. 
  Asked why he "borrowed" the money from Kiyoshi Sagawa, owner 
of the Sagawa Kyubin group, but not from an ordinary financial 
institution, Hosokawa replied, "I was concerned about what 
evaluation a bank would have given for the sword guard I was 
planning to put up" as one of the two collaterals. The premier 
also said, "Mr. Sagawa demonstrated a more flexible stance than 
a bank by agreeing to allow me to repay the loan in several 
installations, so choosing him as a lender was economically a 
more advantageous choice." 
  "In Japan, it is customary to consult with your relatives or 
close acquaintances rather than with a bank (in taking out a 
loan)," he said. "I decided to borrow the money from Mr. 
Sagawa, as he has coincidentally rented one of my vacation 
houses," he said. 
  Hosokawa denied allegations that he distributed the 100 
million yen to Kumamoto Prefecture Assembly legislators in 
winning official endorsement as a candidate backed by the then 
ruling Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] for the 1993 gubernatorial 
race. The legislators were reported to have a strong say over 
the central LDP leadership in picking up the LDP-backed 
candidate for the gubernatorial race. 
  "If I had planned to use the money for under-the-table 
payoffs, I would not have borrowed the money in such a 
conspicuous manner as pledging my vacation house as collateral," 
he said. 
  Hosokawa also rejected allegations that his explanations to 
the Diet were contradictory, as loan-related documents he had 
submitted to the Diet do neither carry his seal nor a mandatory 
revenue stamp. "The documents I submitted were the xeroxed 
copies of the duplicates of the original documents which have 
been kept by Sagawa Kyubin, so it is natural for them not to 
carry my seal or revenue stamps," the premier said. 
  Last January 7, Hosokawa described the documents as "full of 
defects" in his reply to an opposition questioner at a House of 
Councillors session. 
  In a related development, the leader of the Liberal 
Democratic Party's largest policy study group urged LDP 
President Yohei Kono to place priority on uncovering suspicions 
surrounding Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 1982 acceptance 
of the 100 million yen loan from the scandal-ridden trucking 
group. 
  LDP officials said former Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, 
who 
is spearheading the newly-founded, 182-legislator group, made 
the appeal in a meeting with Kono at the LDP's headquarters in 
Tokyo's Nagatacho [district]. 
  The meeting between the two LDP executives followed an 
inaugural meeting of the policy study group, called, 
"Sasshin-no-kai" (Association for Renewal), the officials said. 
  Nakayama called on Kono to demand the resignation of 
Hosokawa 
to take responsibility for the scandal involving the Sagawa 
Kyubin group, a trucking conglomerate whose reported payoffs to 
ex-LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru triggered public anger against the 
LDP. Voter disaffection following the Sagawa scandal is partly 
responsible for the LDP's loss of its 38-year grip on power. 
  In reply, Kono pledged cooperation with the newly-founded 
group, the officials said. "Let's push the matter in 
solidarity," Kono was quoted as telling Nakayama. 
  The LDP said the premier's explanations to the Diet have not 
dispelled suspicions that he obtained the money as an illegal 
unreported political donation. The LDP, Japan's largest 
political party, alleged that evidence points to Hosokawa's 
using the money to grease the palms of Kumamoto Assembly 
legislators whose goodwill he needed to win the nomination as 
the LDP's sole candidate for the 1983 gubernatorial race.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Wednesday [30 March] denied that he was personally 
involved in a 1986 purchase of 300 shares of giant Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT). 
  Hosokawa told the House of Representatives Budget Committee 
he never met the investment consultant who said he arranged the 
deal on behalf of Hosokawa. "I have never met (the consultant) 
nor sought his advice," Hosokawa said in response to a query by 
Taro Nakayama of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and Japanese 
Communist Party lawmaker Zenmei Matsumoto. 
  What the consultant says "is not a fact," he said. Hosokawa 
says the share transaction was conducted by his late 
father-in-law. It is not known whether the deal was legal. 
  Earlier, Shuzo Fujiki, the consultant, said at an 
LDP-arranged press conference in the Diet building that the 
transaction was the prime minister's own. Fujiki said he 
arranged a 418 million yen loan for Hosokawa's former aide from 
a stock investment company to help finance the purchase of 300 
NTT shares in 1986 just after NTT went public. 
  Fujiki said the stock investment financing company agreed to 
allow Hosokawa to use the name of his father-in-law at the 
request of Hosokawa's financial secretary Masatoshi Miyama. 
When Fujiki visited the company in October 1986 with Miyama, 
the former Hosokawa aide asked a company official to permit the 
use of a name other than Hosokawa's for the account for the loan. 
  Everything concerning the transaction was conducted "on the 
assumption that it was Mr. Hosokawa's own deal," Fujiki said. 
He said he is willing to testify before the Diet about his 
allegations. 
  Over Miyama's involvement in the stock deal, Hosokawa said 
all he knows is that Miyama provided advice to his father-in-law 
from time to time, dismissing the call for Diet testimony on the 
matter by the former aide. 
  Concerning a murky loan Hosokawa took from a scandal-tainted 
trucking firm, Sagawa Kyubin, which had paralyzed the Diet 
budget business for three weeks, the Communist Party's Matsumoto 
said there were some faults in the documents the prime minister 
submitted to the Diet. But Hosokawa only responded by saying, 
"They are all documents maintained by Sagawa Kyubin." 
  "I borrowed 100 million yen from the company, and nothing 
more," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- The Construction Ministry 
on Wednesday [30 March] issued a new manual to guide its field 
offices in dealing with bid-rigging practices by contractors for 
public works projects, officials said. The ministry also 
decided to establish committees in various localities across the 
nation to assess the fairness of bidding practices, the 
officials said. 
  The manual instructs local field offices to immediately 
report possible incidences of big rigging to the committees 
without waiting to confirm the truth or falsehood of the 
information. 
  If the committees decide to launch an inquiry, all bidders 
will be questioned separately. Even if no evidence of bid 
rigging is turned up, the bidders will each have to sign a 
written oath. 
  The manual says that when bidding takes place, all bidders 
should submit their estimated construction costs in written form 
to the committees before the winner is decided. If evidence of 
possible bid rigging is uncovered in the process, the awarding 
of the contract in question to the lowest bidder should be 
delayed or canceled, it says. 
  The new policies are scheduled to be applied to construction 
orders issued from April.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- The Tokyo High Court on 
Wednesday [30 March] upheld a lower court ruling that rejected 
residents' demands for a ban on night flights at the U.S. Yokota 
air base but the high court increased the compensation to the 
plaintiffs. It ruled that the residents be paid an additional 
190 million yen in addition to the 330 million yen for past 
suffering ordered by the lower court, bringing the total 
compensation to 520 million yen. 
  Some 600 residents near the base on the outskirts of Tokyo 
filed a suit demanding the Japanese Government ban flights at 
the base between 9 PM And 7 AM, and pay compensation for their 
suffering from noise both in the past and in the future. 
  In March 1989, the Hachioji branch of the Tokyo District 
Court rejected the suit's demands for a ban on night flights and 
compensation for future annoyance but ordered the government to 
pay 330 million yen in compensation for past noise nuisance. 
Both sides appealed the ruling. 
  The supreme court ruled in two earlier noise pollution suits 
in February 1993 that the U.S. Forces are using the base in 
accordance with the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and the Japanese 
Government has no jurisdiction over the management of the base, 
rejecting a ban on the night flights and compensation for future 
suffering. 
  In November last year, Japan and the United States agreed 
that flights and ground activities at the base between 10 PM And 
6 AM should be restricted to those which are essential to the 
U.S. military's operations. 
  In the same month, the Tokyo high court presented a 
compromise to the two sides in the present suit including a 
proposal that flights not be permitted between 10 PM and 7 AM. 
The government and the residents had talks over the court's 
compromise proposal but failed to reach agreement. 
  Presiding Judge Kiyoshi Uetani said about 40 percent of the 
noise from air drills occurs during the night or early morning. 
The plaintiffs living near the base "have disturbed sleep and 
daily life, and suffered from damage that may include physical 
injury, including difficulty in hearing and ringing in the 
ears," he said. 
  Uetani, however, rejected the demand for a ban on 
operations, 
saying the Japanese Government, the defendant, cannot control 
activities of the U.S. military forces under Japan-U.S. security 
arrangements. 
  Upon handing down the ruling, Uetani asked the plaintiffs 
and 
the defendant to abandon distrust of each other and to continue 
negotiations. "It is hard to solve such a matter through law or 
a trial," he said. 
  The Yokota base is one of the most important U.S. bases in 
the Asia-Pacific region. It is about 40 kilometers from Tokyo, 
covering about 7 million square meters. It includes the 
headquarters of the U.S. military in Japan and has a 
3,000-meter runway.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- Representatives of 
information-related industries on Wednesday [30 March] asked the 
government to carry out its economic stimulus measures promptly 
so as to help them out of the prolonged business slump. Leaders 
of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) and 
four other sectors related to information, electronics and 
electrical machinery made the request during a breakfast meeting 
with Hiroshi Kumagai, international trade and industry minister. 
  Tadahiro Sekimoto, chairman of the EIAJ, while making a 
severe assessment of business conditions surrounding his 
industry, said the government should place top priority on 
stimulating the economy. 
  Takashi Kitaoka, chairman of the Japan Electronic Industry 
Development Association, sought an increased role by the 
government in upgrading the information infrastructure in Japan, 
particularly promotion of information networking. 
  The computer industry suffered a sharp setback in hardware 
production for the second consecutive year, Kitaoka said. 
  Kumagai said his ministry is maximizing efforts for an early 
recovery of Japanese business activity, for example, by 
formulating a program to create new business. But structural 
problems facing Japan's business sectors need to be solved 
first, Kumagai said, noting such problems are partly responsible 
for high material, personnel and production costs in Japan. 
  Tomoo Takahara, chairman of the Japan Information Service 
Industry Association, said the ailing software industry is 
pushing ahead with efficient relocation of white-collar workers 
and revamping of overall business operations.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- Sales at Japan's large 
retailers decreased 2.8 percent in February from a year earlier 
to 1,452.3 billion yen, the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (MITI) said Tuesday [29 March]. It was the 21st 
straight month of falling sales at department stores and 
supermarket chains, the ministry said in a preliminary report. 
  The stagnant performance reflected continuing price 
consciousness among Japanese consumers, the ministry said. 
  Sales at 419 department stores across the nation dropped 4.4 
percent to 723.0 billion yen, for the 24th running month of 
declines from year-earlier levels, it said. Sales at 2,059 
supermarket chains edged down 1.0 percent to 729.4 billion yen, 
marking the 19th straight month of drops. 
  The 2.8 percent sales fall in February compares with a 2.5 
percent drop registered in January.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- Japan's industrial 
production in February grew 0.2 percent from the preceding 
month, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) 
said Wednesday [30 March]. The growth pace was slower that 
January's 1.0 percent increase. 
  The seasonally adjusted production index for the mining and 
manufacturing sectors stood at 88.9 against a base of 100 for 
1990, MITI announced in a preliminary report. 
  The reading compares with projections of output increases 
for 
February ranging from 0.8 to 3.0 percent made by 20 major think 
tanks in a survey by KYODO NEWS SERVICE earlier. 
  A production outlook index for the manufacturing sector 
indicates a rise in March and a downswing in April. The future 
course of final demand is uncertain, necessitating further 
monitoring of coming movements, MITI said. 
  Shipments climbed 1.2 percent in February, with the index 
standing at 91.1, compared with a 0.7 percent rise in January. 
  The inventory index dropped 1.0 percent to 106.8, following 
a 
0.4 percent decrease in January. 
  The February inventory-to-sales ratio fell 2.6 percent 
against a 2.9 percent slide in January, with the index standing 
at 119.1. 
  Industrial output had swung up and down in the six months to 
January -- showing a 1.2 percent fall in August, a 2.2 percent 
gain in September, a 5.5 percent slide in October, a 2.2 percent 
rise in November, a 1.9 percent drop in December and a 1.0 
percent increase in January. 
  On an unadjusted basis, industrial production in February 
slid 4.2 percent from a year before, extending a record string 
of year-to-year declines to 29 months.

  [Text] BUSINESS TIMES [BT] Editor Patrick Daniel thought 
up his defence that he had believed it was not against the law 
to publish official information if it came from a private source 
only after BT published the secret data, the prosecution said 
yesterday. 
  This was when he was told by Mr. Lam Chuan Leong, permanent 
secretary of the Trade and Industry Ministry, that the report 
may have breached the Official Secrets Act [OSA]. 
  It was only then that he looked up the act and came to his 
conclusion that BT had not committed an offence, said the 
attorney general [AG]. 
  Mr. Chan Sek Keong said he saw no evidence which showed that 
the editor had thought about this before publishing the data. 
  Nor did Daniel know where BT journalist Kenneth James had 
obtained the data from at the time it was sent to him over the 
BT's electronic message system, he added. 
  Daniel, one of five men charged with breaching the Official 
Secrets Act, had said that he considered the possibility that 
publishing data obtained from the private sector was an offence, 
but dismissed it. This was because the data would already be in 
the public domain and could no longer be considered secret. 
  He is charged with receiving the official flash estimate of 
Singapore's economic growth in the second quarter of 1992 and 
communicating it to BT readers on June 29, 1992. 
  Submitting the prosecution's case against Daniel, Mr. Chan 
noted that ISD [Internal Security Department] officers had found 
a copy of the OSA in the BT offices with sections of the Act 
highlighted. 
  This showed that Daniel had been studying the Act between 
the 
time the article was published and his first interview with the 
ISD. 
  It also explained how Daniel was able to query the ISD 
officer recording his statement for more than an hour on aspects 
of the Act, he said. 
  Earlier, Mr. Chan had told the court that Daniel had 
admitted 
to the ISD that he knew that publishing the flash estimate 
"could possibly be a breach of the OSA," but had done so to give 
BT readers an accurate picture of the economy. 
  The AG urged the court not to believe Daniel's testimony 
clarifying this point, saying it was "merely an attempt to 
qualify his admissions to the ISD." 
  Taking up the defence's argument that Daniel did not know 
that the 4.6 percent figure was the actual flash estimate, he 
said that whatever the editor thought about the figure, the fact 
was that he had published it. 
  Besides, he had referred to the figure as the official flash 
estimate in his statements to the ISD and in the June 29 report, 
he noted. 
  During the AG's two-hour long submissions, he was 
interrupted 
several times by Mr. K. Shanmugam, lawyer for Daniel. The 
lawyer wanted to state his client's position and seek 
clarifications. 
  He said that Daniel did not know the figure was the flash 
estimate when he received it. It was only after it had been 
bounced off chief statistician Paul Cheung that he thought the 
figure might be close to the flash estimate. 
  On Daniel's belief that it was not an offence to publish 
official data if it came from a private sector source, he said 
that his client had operated with a"mental map," which included 
this belief, he said. 
  Besides, he argued the prosecution's submission was 
inconsistent with its earlier arguments. 
  "If Mr. Daniel did not even consider the OSA either at the 
time of receipt or at the time of publication, it seems to me 
logically inconsistent to argue that he knew that it could 
possibly be a breach of the Act," he said, asking the AG to 
clarify his position. 
  Mr. Chan replied that he would consider this point and 
respond today when the prosecution is expected to wrap up its 
submissions.

<F P=106> [By Warren Fernandez and Brendan Pereira] </F>
  [Text] Raymond Foo was reckless in communicating secret 
information as he uttered it when a former government economist 
was close by, the Attorney-General [A-G] said yesterday. 
  Mr. Chan Sek Keong argued that the court could find Foo in 
breach of the Official Secrets Act [OSA] even if it decided that 
there was not enough evidence to show that Foo had intended to 
communicate the information to Mr. Choy Keen Meng. 
  The A-G said Foo knew or ought to have known that when he 
mentioned the figure 4.6 percent to Mr. Kelvin Quek, a 
government economist, his utterance would have been heard by Mr. 
Choy. 
  This was because the latter was close by. Yet he took the 
risk, said the A-G. 
  Foo is alleged to have communicated the flash estimates on 
the way to lunch on June 19 with Mr. Quek and Mr. Choy. 
  The A-G said the evidence of Mr. Quek and Mr. Choy, which 
the 
prosecution had relied on to prove that Foo knew that the flash 
estimate for the second quarter was 4.6 percent, had not been 
rebutted. 
  For instance, he noted that Mr. Quek's testimony that he was 
certain he had discussed and explained the nature of the flash 
estimates to the accused remained "unshaken". 
  Under cross examination by Mr. Chelva Rajah, counsel for 
Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Mr. Quek had shown he was a truthful 
witness, said the A-G. 
  "He was prepared to admit that it was not proper for him to 
have given an indication of the direction in which the economy 
was heading." 
  During his lunch meeting with Foo, Mr. Quek had indicated 
how 
certain sectors of the economy were performing. 
  During his hour-long submission, the A-G yesterday asked 
that 
a number of inferences be drawn against Foo. 
  Among them: 
  -- That he had heard Manu Bhaskaran utter the words "first 
flash" as otherwise he would not have remembered the expression 
when giving his statement to the Internal Security Department. 
  -- That Foo also understood from Mr. Quek's explanation that 
flash estimates are never published, and only the final figure 
would be published.

<F P=106> [Speech by Paek Hak-yon, vice chairman of the Pyongyang City </F>
People's Committee, at a Pyongyang mass rally held on the 
afternoon of 29 March in the Socialist Working Youth League's 
hall to condemn deployment of Patriot missiles to South 
Korea--recorded] 
  [Text] All Korean compatriots in the North, the South, and 
overseas are seething with surging indignation over the reckless 
arms reinforcement maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists and the 
South Korean ruling bunches to introduce Patriot missiles to 
South Korea. 
  As has already been reported, while talking about strong 
countermeasures and the like at the recent so-called 
high-ranking policymakers conference and security-related 
ministers' meeting, the South Korean ruling bunches are 
perpetrating the extremely provocative [simhi tobalchogin] arms 
reinforcement maneuvers of introducing Patriot missiles into 
South Korea in conspiracy with the United States. 
  Not satisfied with turning South Korea into the largest 
nuclear powderkeg in the Far East, filled with some 1,000 
nuclear weapons, and into an exhibition of murderous weapons 
with various types of up-to-date war equipment, the U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean ruling bunches now are 
attempting to introduce Patriot missiles and other new armed 
forces into South Korea. Such an act is not only an open threat 
[kongongyonhan wihyop] against us, but is also a persistent and 
open provocative act for a northward invasion to ignite a 
nuclear war by intentionally aggravating the situation on the 
Korean peninsula [chosonbandoui chongserul kouijoguro 
kinjangsikyo kutkunnae haekchonjaengui pulchibul toturiryonun 
nogolchogin pukchim tobal haengwi]. 
  I bitterly condemn [chunyolhi kyutan] the reckless arms 
reinforcement maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists and the South 
Korean ruling bunches who are introducing Patriot missiles into 
South Korea, branding them as a flagrant challenge to the entire 
nation's desire for peace and denuclearization in the Korean 
peninsula and as an intolerable nation killing act [yongnap 
motal minjok myolsal haengwi] to provoke a nuclear war by 
intentionally aggravating the situation. [applause] 
  The deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea by U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean ruling bunches despite the 
protest and condemnation of all the Korean people at home and 
abroad and the peace-loving people of the world is part of the 
U.S. maneuvers to make the Korean peninsula the source of a new 
war in accordance with its policy toward Korea and strategy 
toward Asia. It is also a direct product of the South Korean 
puppet clique's insidious political and military attempt to plot 
to harm and to crush fellow countrymen on the strength of 
outside forces. 
  Since it pursues aggression, the United States does not 
welcome the alleviation of the Korean peninsula's situation and 
the improvement in North-South relations. It has promoted 
distrust [pulsingamul chosonghago] between the North and the 
South and has aggravated confrontation and tensions between them 
by (?agitating) antinational elements [panminjok punjadul] of 
South Korea in an obsolete way [kutaeuiyonhage]. 
  After reversing the agreement reached at the New York 
contact 
between the DPRK and the United States to finally rupture 
DPRK-U.S. talks, the United States is now expanding steps of 
military provocation maneuvers to threaten us. This proves that 
the United States has no intention to resolve the nuclear issue 
of the Korean peninsula in a peaceful way and that it has only 
the insidious aim to threaten, isolate, and crush [apsal] us by 
force. 
  It has been the nature of all successive South Korean 
colonial puppet regimes to devote themselves to war provocations 
against fellow countrymen by depending upon outside forces, and 
this nature has become broader and more vicious under the 
so-called civilian rule. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: The South 
Korean authorities have frequently conducted large-scale 
military exercises against our republic in collusion with 
outside forces, and they are driving North-South relations to a 
dangerous phase, talking about military countermeasures, an 
international cooperation system, and the like under the pretext 
of our nuclear issue. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has increased funds for 
maintaining U.S. occupation forces in South Korea since he came 
into power, and provides over $3 billion to keep the U.S. Forces 
stationed in South Korea. The puppet clique has also placed 
South Korean harbor facilities at the disposal of the United 
States according to the Wartime Host Nations Support Agreement 
signed between the two. It did not hesitate even in committing 
the flunkyist and nation-selling act of opening the whole rice 
market to the United States in return for bagging an 
international cooperation system, in the ambition of harming 
[mohae] and crushing [apsal] fellow countrymen with the borrowed 
sword of outside forces. 
  Agitated by the United States, their master, the South 
Korean 
puppets are deepening North-South confrontation by engaging in a 
northward invasion maneuver more frantically then ever. 
  It is the South Korean rulers that stirred up South-North 
confrontation and the northward invasion mood by paying frequent 
visits to military units and war exercise grounds at the 
frontline around the Military Demarcation Line and by talking 
about strong military countermeasures. It is none other than 
the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique with its civilian mask that has 
turned South Korea's entirety into a scene of terrible war with 
the daily staging of the provocative Team Spirit joint military 
exercise and other titled and untitled war exercises, including 
Hwarang, Ssangyong, Ulchi, and Focus-Lens exercises. 
  Voices of warmongers which aggravate North-South 
confrontation have become harsher during South Korea's freeze of 
North-South dialogue by the Kim Yong-sam ring. Frantic war 
commotions are also being kicked up every day. 
  On 22 March, the Kim Yong-sam ring called together the 
puppet 
army's bosses to Chongwadae [presidential office] and ordered 
them to put the puppet armed forces in a state of alert by 
babbling about the being thoroughly prepared for a northward 
invasion through the so-called cooperative system with the 
United States. Also, that same day, the U.S. ambassador to 
Seoul, the commander of the U.S. forces occupying South Korea, 
the boss of the puppet Ministry of National Defense, and the 
boss of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs held discussions on the 
northward invasion and took successive provocative steps against 
us. 
  Following this, the so-called minister of the South Korean 
Ministry of National Defense even widely announced a new 
operational plan 5027, a northward invasion war plan, which was 
formulated in a joint cooperation with the U.S. imperialists. 
All these serious moves by the South Korean puppets show that 
their provocative plots for northward invasion have been now 
reached a very grave stage [maeu omjunghan tangye]. 
  Because of the arms buildup plot and the indiscriminative 
northward invasion maneuver by warmongering U.S. imperialists 
and South Koreans who are kicking up war hysteria, today the 
situation on the Korean peninsula is being strained at its 
breaking point in which a nuclear war can suddenly result, even 
from an accidental mistake [onului pandojongsenun ubalchogin 
silsue uihaesodo pulsie haekchonjaenguro ponjyojilsu innun 
ilchokchukpalui wigie chingmyonhada]. 
  The situation on the Korean peninsula, in which the North 
and 
South even discussed an exchange of special envoys just some 
time ago, has rapidly reached the brink of war. This is because 
the Kim Yong-sam ring have committed an adventurous military 
provocative plot to crush [apsal] us, their same fellow 
countrymen by following outside forces. 
  Such a grave situation in which a danger of new war is 
imminent [sae chonjaeng wihomi nunape paktuhago innun] proves 
that it is the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique who is the 
nation-seller of the times, the peace-breaker, and the 
nation-separator who does not want peace and peaceful 
reunification on the Korean peninsula. 
  Reality clearly shows that without removing the 
anti-national 
ring, such as the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique, we cannot improve 
North-South relations at any moment nor achieve national unity 
or the reunification of the fatherland, and that the nation 
cannot avoid nuclear disaster. 
  All fellow countrymen at home and abroad, who oppose war but 
instead want peace and reunification, must rise up as one to 
conduct an anti-Kim Yong-sam struggle. The South Korean people 
from all walks of life must smash the Kim Yong-sam ring's 
flunkyist and nation-selling plot of relying on outside forces 
at every step and smash its fascist, nation-separating plots of 
war in all places. 
  The one who is creating a nuclear crisis on the Korean 
peninsula, aggravating the North-South confrontation, and 
promoting a war of aggression toward the North is none other 
than the United States. 
  The South Korean people should resolutely block and rupture 
the introduction of U.S. destructive weapons, including Patriot 
missiles, and more vigorously inflame the struggle against 
America and for independence [panmi chajuhwa tujaeng]. 
  The United States must stop its foolish act of exercising 
influence over South Korean antinational elements who have been 
abandoned by the nation and branded as a target to be trampled, 
and immediately discontinue the introduction of nuclear war 
equipment and reckless provocation maneuver for a new war. 
  If the United States continues to place Patriot missiles in 
South Korea, resumes the Team Spirit joint military exercise, 
and clings to the reckless aggression maneuver against us 
babbling that pressure on North Korea should be strengthened 
through real actions [silchi haengdong], it will be totally 
responsible for the grave consequence [omjunghan huga] 
thereafter. 
  Our people are not the ones who would be frightened by the 
military threats by the U.S. imperialists and South Korean 
puppets. Our people, who are single-heartedly united around the 
beloved and respected Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il who 
has peerless courage, iron-clad will, and ever-victorious wisdom 
and tactics, are fully prepared to fight against any provocation 
by the U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppet clique. If the 
enemies dare to challenge us, we will punish [chingbol] them 
hundreds and thousands times more. [applause] 
  If a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula due to the 
aggression of the U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets, 
what we lose is the Military Demarcation Line, and the only ones 
that will disappear from this land are invaders and the nation's 
traitor bunch. All the people in the northern half of the 
republic should closely watch the enemies' provocation maneuvers 
of northward aggression with keen alertness. If the enemies 
challenge us, all the people should firmly hold a rifle in one 
hand, hammer and sickle in the other, strengthen the might of 
socialism by effecting a great revolutionary upsurge in all 
sectors and units, and turn the entire country into an 
iron-walled fortress so that we could sweep them with a single 
blow. 
  Along with this, we should vigorously carry out the movement 
to consider our factories, our farms, and our schools as our 
outposts, to care about and love the People's Army with family 
love and to wholeheartedly support the Army. 
  As long as we have the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who 
is an ever-victorious iron-clad courageous general and 
outstanding military strategist, and as long as we bear the 
undoubted belief and firm will of the iron truth that we will 
win without fail, we have nothing to be afraid of, and even if 
the globe breaks up and the sky falls down, our chuche 
fatherland will stand aloft as the sanctum of socialism in the 
world, forever flaunting a socialist banner. [applause] 
  Let us all single-heartedly unite around the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Kim Chong-il, and all 
the more vigorously fight on to smash [chitpusida] the 
antirepublic maneuvers of the imperialists and their hunting 
dogs and to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification 
of the fatherland and the perfect victory of socialism. 
[applause]

now. The danger of war on the Korean Peninsula is approaching 
the nation nearer and nearer as a reality rather than an 
assumption [kajong]. In connection with this grave situation, 
we send this letter of appeal to you, the South Korean people of 
various strata and the compatriots overseas. 
  The urgent situation on the Korean peninsula, which the 
world's good people are watching with deep worries, is not 
caused because our people in the North and the South wanted it 
nor because our fellow countrymen themselves caused it. It is 
forced upon intentionally by the flunkyist nation-selling forces 
in South Korea which turned away from the nation, and by outside 
forces. 
  Our people in the North and the South want independent and 
peaceful reunification of the country, but the flunkeyist 
nation-selling forces in South Korea are scheming for 
reunification by northward invasion. Our compatriots at home 
and abroad look forward to peace in the country, but the 
bellicose forces in South Korea seek confrontation and war. 
  For the denuclearization on the Korean peninsula, national 
alliance [minjok kongjo cheje] is necessary, but the South 
Korean authorities attempt international alliance [kukje kongjo 
cheje]. For peace in the country, there should not be the danger 
of war, but the South Korean authorities attempt to resume the 
Team Spirit nuclear war exercise. For the reunification of the 
country, national unity is essential, but they are begging for 
sanctions [chejae] against fellow countrymen. 
  The South Korean authorities not only unilaterally broke 
down 
the hard-won working delegates' contact by abusing the issue of 
the North-South exchange of special envoys to obstruct the 
DPRK-U.S. talks, which can fundamentally resolve the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula, but are openly agitating war, 
bringing Patriot missiles into South Korea under this pretext, 
and even disclosing a new plan for war of northward invasion 
called New Operations Plan 5027 which they have already worked 
out. They even issued a special alert order to the South Korean 
Army. With such violent war remarks as punishment and an 
opportunity for reunification, they are massively assembling 
troops and equipment along the Military Demarcation Line, thus 
not hesitating military provocation against us. 
  These ominous military moves [simsangchiannun kunsajok 
umjigimun] are now bringing the situation in our country to the 
very dangerous brink of war. It is clear to anyone that in our 
country, where the two sides are acutely [paengpaenghage] 
confronting each other along the Military Demarcation Line, any 
accidental event can cause full-scale military conflicts 
[kuoddon ubalchogin sagoeuihaesodo chonmyonjogin kunsajok 
chungdori ironalsuitta]. If a fuse to nuclear war is ignited on 
the Korean peninsula, our fatherland will be turned into a 
wasteland, and our nation, which has a 5,000-year history, will 
suffer an irrevocable catastrophe. How can any patriotic Korean 
turn a blind eye to a reality in which such a national tragedy 
is enforced? 
  Genuine patriotism for our nation is manifested in 
preventing 
the incoming danger of war and defending peace in the country. 
It is time all Korean people who love the country, irrespective 
of whether they live in the North, the South, or abroad, join 
hands and rise up to remove the danger of war, which is caused 
by the toadyist and treacherous forces in South Korea, and open 
a blue sky of peace on the Korean peninsula. 
  Brothers and sisters in the North and South and abroad: War 
is not a fate that our nation has no choice but to suffer. The 
danger of war which looms now on the Korean peninsula is a 
byproduct of the policy of relying on outside forces, a policy 
espoused by the South Korean authorities who cannot defend 
independence, the nation's lifeline. 
  Our national history has given us a lesson that whenever 
power is made sport of [nongnak] by men of noble birth who lack 
independence, the territory will turn into an arena of 
competition among outside forces, and the fellow countrymen will 
suffer the tragic fate of national ruin. 
  The current authorities in South Korea are dishonest 
political dealers [chongchi kansangbae] who most heavily rely on 
outside forces and are the most toadyist and treacherous, among 
all rulers in South Korea. How can we come to terms with 
[tahyop] toadyist and treacherous forces, who follow outside 
forces, even when we know relying on outside forces would bring 
war? And, how can we turn a blind eye to a rule and 
intervention by outside forces even when we know that would 
bring the nation to a nuclear catastrophe? Coming to terms and 
turning a blind eye will lead the nation to self-destruction. 
  People from all parties, factions, and walks of life in 
South 
Korea and overseas compatriots: You must remove national 
betrayers who pursue the policy of relying on outside forces and 
resolutely wage the struggle to defend national independence! 
You must also resolutely part with the toadyist and treacherous 
regime and boldly join in the struggle to remove this regime! 
If you do not join in the struggle today, this will help the 
toadyist and treacherous forces find ways for their existence, 
and, then, a fuse to war will be ignited in this land. It will 
be too late to regret it and useless to lament it then. 
  The struggle to remove the toadyist and treacherous forces 
in 
South Korea is a patriotic road toward rescuing the country from 
a disaster and keeping the fellow countrymen alive and the road 
of sacred struggle to achieve peace in the country and hasten 
the country's peaceful reunification. 
  People from all parties, factions, and walks of life in 
South 
Korea: You must vigorously rise up and fight to remove the Kim 
Yong-sam treacherous regime and build an independence, 
democratic regime on its grave! 
  If the danger of war is to be prevented, the reckless war 
maneuvers by the United States and South Korean warmongers must 
be checked and frustrated [choji patan]. 
  The Team Spirit war exercise cannot be peaceful, and the 
introduction of Patriot missiles is not intended for peace. 
And, the movement of the U.S. military warships to the South 
Korean waters will surely threaten peace, and the reckless 
military actions taken under a special alert order will surely 
destroy [pagoe] peace. 
  All South Korean people and overseas compatriots: You 
must raise your voices of denunciation everywhere and raise the 
flames of resistance to oppose the resumption of the Team Spirit 
joint military exercise, reject the introduction of Patriot 
missiles, and check and frustrate the deployment of U.S. 
warships to the South Korean waters and all other commotions for 
military provocations! 
  Officers and men of the South Korean Armed Forces: You must 
resolutely reject the criminal orders of the warmongers who 
force you to become mercenaries [yongbyong] of outside forces 
and inflict a catastrophe of nuclear war on your fathers and 
mothers, wives and children, and brothers and sisters and your 
fellow countrymen, and aim your guns at the aggressors and 
treacherous forces! 
  It is time the South Korean people free themselves from rule 
and intervention by outside forces. The real danger of war was 
caused by rule and intervention by the United States, and the 
endless continuation of national division was caused by it. 
  There is no war only when there is no aggressor in the 
country, and there is no nuclear war only when there are no 
nuclear weapons. 
  All South Korean people: You must vigorously wage the 
struggle to defend national dignity and independence and remove 
the U.S. forces and nuclear weapons from South Korea by 
displaying the proud wisdom and courage of a nation with the 
5,000-year history! You must wage an anti-U.S., antiwar, and 
antinuclear struggle to free yourselves from a rule and 
intervention by the United States, check and frustrate the 
maneuvers by the South Korean rulers to develop nuclear weapons, 
and turn the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free peace zone! 
  Great unity of the entire nation leads to peace in the 
country and the fatherland's reunification. Today, when the 
fiery clouds of war are coming in every moment, all fellow 
countrymen in the North and South and abroad, transcending 
differences in ideas, ideology, and systems, must unite and 
unite among themselves. 
  Only the strength of unity can prevent war, defend peace, 
and 
rescue the nation from a disaster. 
  The 10-point program of great unity of the entire nation for 
the fatherland's reunification is a banner of patriotism that 
prevents war and calls our fellow countrymen to peace and unity 
and a torch of patriotism that enables our fellow countrymen to 
cultivate their destinies on their own. 
  Let us all consider the 10-point program of great unity of 
the entire nation to be a common guideline for the nation, unite 
with each other as one nation, first of all, and join in the 
struggle to prevent the danger of nuclear war hovering over the 
head of the nation and open a road toward peace in the country 
and its peaceful reunification! 
  All parties, factions, and people from all walks of life in 
the North and South and abroad: Let us achieve the consensus of 
will and unite their strengths to make joint efforts time and 
again for the sake of great national unity, the most sacred 
patriotism! 
  Our people in the northern half of the Republic will always 
firmly stand by the South Korean people who are fighting to 
prevent the danger of war, which looms in the face of the 
nation, and defend peace in the country.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
puppets held a "meeting of all the staff of the Army" on March 
26 to discuss a matter concerning "immediate commitment into 
action in the event of contingency" and, at the same day, the 
puppet prime minister visited puppet army units in the frontline 
areas, instructing them to maintain a "full-dressed posture to 
provide against an event of contingency". 
  NODONG SINMUN today says this shows that the wildcat war 
provocation moves of the South Korean puppets have reached a 
most dangerous phase. 
  The news analyst points out: 
  Such military provocation moves of the South Korean puppets 
are all the more dangerous as they are timed to coincide with 
the aggressive U.S. military actions against the DPRK now at a 
very grave stage. 
  It has been made clearer that the "civilian government" and 
"unification" on the lips of the Kim Yong-sam group are no more 
than a smoke screen to cover up its moves for confrontation and 
war. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam clique, clean [as received] 
indifferent to the destiny of the nation and busy to find a way 
out in its military adventure as a stooge of the aggressive 
imperialist reactionaries, will be under fire at home and abroad. 
  The DPRK is ready for both dialogue and war. If the South 
Korean puppets ignite a war, continuing reckless military 
provocation moves in league with outside forces, our heroic 
People's Army and people will deal one thousand-fold fatal blows 
at them.

<F P=106> ["`New Operation Plan' Bringing Nuclear Disaster to Korean </F>
Nation" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today 
brands the so-called "New Operation Plan No. 5027" made public 
by South Korean "Defence Minister" Yi Pyong-tae at a recent 
"meeting of the National Assembly Defence Commission" as a war 
plan worked out by the U.S. and South Korean warmaniacs to start 
another war, a nuclear war against the North of the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The analyst says: 
  The Kim Yong-sam group unhesitatingly made public a war plan 
to invade the North which its predecessors had not dared to do, 
not concealing its intention to unleash a war against the North. 
This clearly indicates that the Kim Yong-sam group is a clan of 
more dangerous and heinous warmaniacs than any other rulers of 
South Korea. 
  By mapping out and making public the "new operation plan," 
the Kim Yong-sam group shows that it has neither will to have 
dialogue with the North nor intention to resolve the 
reunification question in a peaceful way and made it unequivocal 
that it will not implement the North-South agreement and the 
joint declaration of denuclearization 
  Now all the Armed Forces of the South Korean puppet Army 
have 
been "alerted" and many U.S. troops and sophisticated combat 
equipment are being carried to South Korea. This reality 
eloquently shows that the Kim Yong-sam group is attempting to 
plunge the nation into a nuclear disaster under the manipulation 
of the U.S. warmongers. 
  With the Kim Yong-sam group left alone, the warmaniacs 
bringing the danger of a nuclear war to the nation, clean 
indifferent [as received] to the destiny of the nation, the 70 
million fellow countrymen can neither be safe nor can the peace 
of Asia and the world be ensured. If our nation is to be saved 
from a nuclear holocaust and the peace of Asia and the world be 
defended, the Kim Yong-sam group dancing to the nuclear 
drum-beating of the United States must be removed. 
  We will never remain an onlooker to the schemes of the U.S. 
and South Korean war-thirsty elements to carry into practice the 
criminal "new operation plan." 
  They must know clearly that we mean what we say.

KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA) of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea released a statement today 
declaring that the invitation extended by the SPA chairman to 
president of the Democratic Party of South Korea Yi Ki-taek 
remains effective and expressing the hope that his visit to 
Pyongyang will surely be realised in a short time. 
  Recalling that SPA Chairman Yang Hyong-sop issued a 
statement 
on January 15 fully supporting the intention expressed by Yi 
Ki-taek at his New Year press conference to visit Pyongyang and 
meet with the great leader President Kim Il-song for the 
self-existence of the nation and the improvement of the 
North-South relations driven into a stalemate and that Yi 
Ki-taek reiterated his intention to visit the North on several 
official occasions, the spokesman says: 
  "We consider that his invariable intention to visit 
Pyongyang 
is an expression of patriotism out of the desire to break grave 
impasse at present and open a bright horizon for the nation. 
  "Anyone who is concerned over the destiny of the country and 
the nation must not block the will to visit Pyongyang and have a 
significant meeting with politicians but provide all necessary 
conditions and conveniences. 
  "We express the belief that his Pyongyang visit, if 
realised, 
would make an affirmative contribution to the denuclearization 
of the Korean peninsula, national reunification and other 
outstanding issues between the North and the South."

<F P=106> ["Two Realities Poles Apart" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- The present realities 
of the North and the South of the Korean peninsula exhibit a 
striking contrast to each other. 
  One could hear in the North the sound of hammering by 
People's Army soldiers participating in socialist construction, 
while in the South gun roar and rifle shots of the puppet Army 
mobilized in war exercises assail the ear. 
  Though a grave situation has been created on the Korean 
peninsula owing to the United States' perfidious act of 
reversing the agreed conclusions reached at the New York contact 
between the DPRK and the United States, soldiers of the Korean 
People's Army [KPA] are performing feats in socialist 
construction, while fulfilling their duty for defence of the 
country. 
  Now soldiers are engaged in building an express highway 
connecting capital Pyongyang to Hyangsan situated in mid-North 
area of Korea. 
  They have laid a roadbed stretching far more than one 
hundred 
kilometres and completed difficult and complex construction of a 
good many structures such as bridges and tunnels. 
  Besides this project, they have taken upon themselves 
several 
major projects of the country. 
  Ever since the early 1980s, they have built the large- scale 
West Sea barrage costing 4 billion dollars, the 
Pyongyang-Kaesong express highway stretching several hundred 
kilometres, the 800 km-long waterways on the west coast, the 
streetcar rails in Pyongyang, the Thaechon power station, the 
Changgwang health complex, the ice-rink, Kwangbok and Thongil 
Streets, and other architectures of eternal value in all parts 
of the country. 
  And, with the Army-people relations getting closer, 
"Army-people fields," "Army-people reservoirs", "Army-people 
bridges", etc. have been brought into being by the soldiers 
across the country. 
  The Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army mobilized 
soldiers in socialist construction on several occasions. More 
than 150,000 soldiers were mobilized in it in 1986 and the Armed 
Forces were cut by 100,000 men in 1987 to be sent to various 
domains of the national economy. 
  But, the puppet Army in the area South of the Military 
Demarcation Line is a tool mercilessly cracking down upon the 
people's struggle calling for independence, democracy and 
reunification. This was proved by the atrocious massacre 
committed by the puppet Army in May, 1980 in suppressing the 
Kwangju popular uprising. At that time, over 14,000 people were 
crippled and more than 5,000 people were killed in cold blood. 
  The puppet Army, together with the U.S. Forces, stage war 
exercises of various codenames such as "Team Spirit", 
"Ssangryong", "Ulchi", "Hwarang" and "Foul Eagle", inflicting 
damages upon the people. This year, too, the South Korean 
puppet Army are staging almost everyday powder-reeking war 
exercises in the sky, on the land and in the sea on the orders 
of the master. These two quite different realities clearly show 
who wants peace and who seeks a war. 
  The KPA is the defender of the motherland, builder of a 
prosperous country and creator of happiness, while the South 
Korean puppet Army is cannon fodder and a suppressive tool 
against the people.

<F P=106> ["S. Korean Authorities Accused of Blocking Pyongyang Trip </F>
of Large-Scale High-Level Foreign Peace Mission" -- KCNA 
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the 
Reunification Policy Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly 
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement 
today denouncing the South Korean authorities for having blocked 
former presidents, prime ministers and other high-level 
politicians of different countries from visiting Pyongyang 
through Panmunjom. 
  The spokesman said: 
  Former presidents, prime ministers and other high-level 
politicians of different countries, who had attended the Second 
World Peace Conference a few days ago, expressed their 
willingness to visit Pyongyang, passing through Panmunjom, in 
order to have a better understanding of the realities of the 
DPRK and manifest their support and solidarity for the Korean 
people's efforts for peace and reunification of the country. 
  Among them were about 100 prominent political activists from 
different continents -- some 30 former heads of state and 
government including former Costa Rican presidents Rodrigo 
Carazo and Mario Echandi, former Sudanese President Abdel Rahman 
Sowar el Dahab and former Prime Minister El Katim el Khalifa, 
former Zambian President Kenneth David Kaunda, former Guyanese 
President Desmond Hoyte, and former Canadian Governor-General 
Edward Schreyer; incumbent and former high-level politicians 
from India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Thailand and other Asian 
countries, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and other Middle East 
countries, France, Spain, Norway and other European countries, 
Brazil, Argentina, Chile and other countries in Latin America; 
and high-level politicians from the United States. 
  The spokesman said: 
  "Though we had made preparations and kept our side's portion 
of Panmunjom open to welcome them as envoys of peace and 
friendship, their visit to Pyongyang could not be realised due 
to the obstruction of the South Korean authorities." 
  Branding the South Korean authorities' act in barring their 
Pyongyang visit by blocking the South side's portion of 
Panmunjom as a rude act against international courtesy and 
morality, he said: 
  What must not be overlooked in their act is that they abused 
the issue of their Pyongyang visit for the purpose of 
North-South confrontation. 
  As was already reported, they unilaterally broke up the 
working contact for the exchange of presidential envoys between 
the North and the South and froze all the dialogue between the 
two sides, driving the situation to the brink of war. 
  They raised a hue and cry over "the threat from the North" 
to 
stir up uneasiness among the people and, at the same time, made 
public a war plan against the North dubbed "New Operation Plan 
No. 5027," openly crying for "unification by prevailing over 
communism." Their racket became noisier when the issue of 
foreign envoys' visit to Pyongyang was raised. 
  Thus they created a grave situation under the eyes of 
foreign 
envoys and, on this pretext, demanded the cancellation of their 
projected passage through Panmunjom and visit to Pyongyang. 
This was really a disgusting, despicable act. 
  Clear is the reason why they blocked the foreign envoys' 
visit to Pyongyang. 
  They were afraid that the quite different realities of the 
North and the South should be known to the world public. 
  Had the mission visited Pyongyang, it would have clearly 
seen 
that, under Korean-style socialism centering on the popular 
masses where the leader, the party and the masses are 
singleheartedly united, all the people are leading an 
independent and creative happy life with no worries about food, 
clothing and housing, stepping up peaceful economic construction 
not "preparations for a war", and are aspiring after a reunified 
Korea, contrary to what the South Korean rulers advertise. 
  And multifarious social evils of South Korea, corrupt and 
ailing under the present "civilian" rule, which stakes its fate 
on outside forces, would have been brought into bolder relief in 
contrast with the North. 
  If the mission had seen the DPRK which is animated with 
peaceful construction, a scene quite different from South Korea 
across the Military Demarcation Line where powder- reeking war 
fever is being incited, it would have understood who really 
wants peace and reunification and who really pursues war and 
division. 
  This is what the South Korean authorities were afraid of. 
  Truth and lie are bound to be made clear. As the sun cannot 
be covered by a palm, so the South Korean authorities can never 
cover up the high external prestige of the ever- victorious DPRK 
by checking the tour of the international mission to the North. 
  The South Korean authorities should no longer continue the 
anti- national act of pursuing division and confrontation 
against the desire of all the fellow countrymen and the 
peaceloving people of the world and the rash action of impairing 
the image of our nation known as the eastern country of good 
manners. 
  We always keep the door open to foreign missions who come to 
do work favorable for the peace and peaceful reunification of 
the Korean peninsula with good intention toward us.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- One million students 
under the South Korean Federation of General Student Councils 
(Hanchongnyon) have risen up in a new struggle to check the 
"parliamentary ratification" of the "implementation schedule of 
the Uruguay Round accord" including rice market opening, 
according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  Students of 130 universities and colleges affiliated with 
Hanchongnyon decided to launch into various forms of struggle 
such as rallies, a signature campaign in streets and 
distribution of literatures in order to check the railroading of 
the "motion" on market opening at the "National Assembly" 
session which will begin on April 12. 
  It decided to hold a meeting of representatives at Pusan 
University in early April with the attendance of more than 
15,000 student representatives from all parts of South Korea and 
then go on a strike against the "parliamentary ratification" of 
the schedule. 
  It also decided to send students to the countryside to wage 
a 
joint struggle with farmers and expand the struggle in 
solidarity with trade unions in May.

People" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- Political party

countries recently. 
  Man Mohan Adhikari, president of the Central Committee of 
the 
Nepal Communist Party (United Marxism-Leninism), said the 
situation on the Korean peninsula had become strained again and 
an atmosphere of war had been created entirely because the 
United States had violated the agreed conclusions reached at the 
DPRK-U.S. contact in New York. 
  "The Nepalese people and the world's peaceloving people are 
voicing full support to the Korean people who are advancing 
under the banner of socialism and communism, firmly rallied

leader Comrade Kim Chong-il," he declared.

leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of 
war.

of 
the Communist Party of Peru (Red Motherland), stressed that his 
party will always stand firmly on the side of the Korean people.

<F P=106> ["Military Threat to and Pressure on DPRK Condemned" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- Political parties and 
organizations of different countries have expressed support to 
the March 21 statement of a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman as 
regards the fact that the United States is aggravating the 
situation of the Korean peninsula after breaking off the 
DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  The Party of the Congress for the Independence, the Militant 
Party for the Realization of Equality and nine other political 
parties of Madagascar published a joint statement on March 23. 
  Noting that the United States is leading the situation of 
the 
Korean peninsula to the extreme pitch of strain after reversing 
the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New 
York, the statement said: "The step taken by the DPRK to cope 
with this is a just one for national sovereignty and security." 
  Eight organizations of Uganda including the Uganda-DPRK 
Friendship Association, the Ugandan National Committee for the 
Study of the Chuche Idea and the Teachers' Association of Uganda 
said in a joint statement on March 22: 
  "The United States has set unreasonable preconditions 
alleging that the inspection by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency was unsatisfactory. This was motivated by their 
insidious political aim to stifle socialist Korea by 
intentionally aggravating the situation." 
  The Ghana-DPRK Friendship Association said in a statement on 
March 22: 
  "We urge the United States to stop its threat and row of 
`sanctions' against the DPRK and sincerely discharge its 
obligation for a package solution to the nuclear issue and the 
IAEA secretariat to take a fair stand, not following the will of 
a big power." 
  Twenty-three political parties and organizations of Peru 
including the Mariateguista United Party and the General 
Confederation of Workers in a joint statement denounced the 
United States for reversing the agreed conclusions reached at 
the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York and scheming to stage the 
"Team Spirit" joint military exercises and deploy "Patriot" 
missiles in South Korea. 
  The statement called upon political parties, organizations 
and public figures throughout the world to strengthen solidarity 
with the Korean people in the efforts for peace and 
reunification.

<F P=106> [Johannes von Dohnanyi report] </F>
  [Excerpts] The indications that a change of power is 
taking place or has perhaps already taken place in the North 
Korean leadership are increasing. After a news conference in 
Bangkok, Yi To-sop, Pyongyang's ambassador to Thailand, told ORF 
that Kim Il-song is the president of North Korea, but the 
ambassador called the president's son, Kim Chong-il, who has 
been declared dear leader by the North Korean propagandists, our 
supreme leader [previous three words in English]. In answer to 
several questions about an explanation of that title, Yi said 
that the supreme leader determines the guidelines, not only of 
defense, but also of domestic and foreign policy. He is not 
only responsible for the military, but for all civilians in 
North Korea. 
  The diplomat did not want to explain in detail the role that 
President Kim Il-song is playing. [passage omitted on 
background information] 
  The regime might have used the present nuclear crisis, which 
North Korea is interpreting as a mere U.S. pretext for 
preparations for a war, to complete the change of power. 
Ambassador Yi To-sop claimed again today that North Korea holds 
the United States alone responsible for this crisis and he 
threatened North Korea's definite withdrawal from the 
Nonproliferation Treaty if U.S. Patriot antimissile systems were 
deployed in South Korea, the U.S.-South Korean military 
maneuvers were held, and the UN Security Council were to adopt 
sanctions against Pyongyang. We are prepared both for war and 
peace, Ambassador Yi said.

struggle to carry it into practice. 
  The collection gives a systematic description of the 
revolutionary activities of President Kim Il-song from the 
meeting of military and political cadres of the Korean People's 
Revolutionary Army which he called and guided in Yaoyinggou, 
Wangqing County, and to the period when he was making 
arrangements for a historical meeting of military and political 
cadres of the KPRA in Nanhutou, Ningan County, after the 
successful second North Manchurian expedition of the main unit. 
  The book consists of three chapters and an appendix. 
  In the first chapter, it carries words (excerpts) of 
President Kim Il-song recalling his revolutionary activities in 
those days. 
  Recorded in the second chapter are individual reminiscences 
of anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters and related persons, and 
in the third chapter materials proving the revolutionary 
activities of President Kim Il-song in those days. 
  The appendix deals with enemy's documents and publications

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- Textile output is 
moving upward in Korea. 
  According to data available at the General Bureau of Textile 
Industry, it grew 30 percent in the first two months of this 
year or more above the same period last year. The output in 20 
odd days of March was 2.4 million metres more than that in the 
same period last month. That period in March witnessed a 19 
percent gain in spinning yarn output. 
  Korea meets the demand of the population for textiles with 
home products from long ago. 
  With his scientific penetration into the limitation of 
cotton 
production and favourable condition of chemical fibre production 
in the country, the great leader President Kim Il-song put 
forward a wise policy of building an independent and modern 
textile industry by correctly combining textile industrial 
branches using chemical fibre with those using other fibres, 
with stress laid on the former. And he set forth a policy of 
developing large scale central industry and medium- and 
small-sized local industry in parallel and has wisely led the 
work for its implementation. 
  Today the nation's textile industry has developed into a 
versatile and mighty industry with chemical fibre, cotton, wool 
and silk textile sectors, which are equipped with uptodate 
technology and firmly rely on domestic raw materials. 
  Hundreds of large and minor spinning and textile mills are 
operating in Pyongyang, Sinuiju, Sariwon, Hamhung and other 
parts of the country. 30 metres of textiles went to each head 
of the population already in 1970 in the country where per 
capita textile output was 14 centimetres before the liberation 
in August 1945. The annual textile output jumped to more than 
800 million metres in the Second Seven-Year Plan period 
(1978-1984). 
  In the period of the Third Seven-Year Plan (1987-1993), 
modern and high-speed textile equipment was introduced and new 
equipment was installed at the Pyongyang textile combine and the 
Kusong, Sariwon and Kaesong textile mills, laying a solid 
foundation for sharply increasing textile output.

said: 
  [Begin Suharto recording in progress] As I said earlier, the 
G-15 wants to offer ideas or initiatives on the selection of 
projects as a follow-up to NAM decisions. The G-15 is not only 
working for its own interests, but also wants to contribute 
ideas to NAM members through the NAM chairman as well as other 
South nations through the Group of 77. Thus, such ideas will 
serve the interests of both the NAM as well as enhance

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- Australian Minister of Trade Bob 
McMullan expressed optimism yesterday that Indonesia will open 
its investment opportunities more extensively. 
  McMullan told reporters after meeting here with Minister of 
Trade Satrio Budiarjo Judono that over recent years, Australian 
investment in Indonesia has sharply increased due to the more 
conducive investment climate which has rapidly deved. 
  He also said the trade relationship between the two 
countries 
has been overwhelmingly harmonious and successful. 
  "Our Prime Minister (Paul Keating) said there is no country 
whose bilateral relationship is more important to Australia than 
our relationship with Indonesia," McMullan remarked. 
  He acknowledged, however, that disagreements between the two 
countries have occurred at times. 
  "But we have a history of a close cooperative trade 
relationship. We have had a decade of rapidly growing bilateral 
trade and we see it continuing to grow," said McMullan, who 
arrived here Saturday for a three-day visit. 
  Responding to questions on his meeting with Judono, McMullan 
said talks in the meeting focussed mainly on how to continue to 
open up economies of both countries, make them more competitive 
and win more business in each country. 
  "We also discussed how to work together in the Asia Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) and how to take full advantage of 
the competitiveness the two countries have created," he said. 
  McMullan said he had invited several ministers, including 
Minister Judono, to visit Australia. 
  After making a courtesy call on President Suharto earlier 
yesterday, McMullan said he sees good opportunities for 
Australian finance, insurance, legal and accounting services in 
Indonesia. 
  Other fields in which he found potential for development by 
Australian investors are mining and food processing. 
  According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, bilateral 
trade between Australia and Indonesia sharply increased from 
US$871.7 million in 1988 to $2.15 billion in 1992. Australia 
enjoyed a trade surplus of $666.8 million from its exports of 
$1.4 billion to Indonesia in 1992, while its imports from 
Indonesia reached only $746.1 million. 
  During the first 11 months of last year, the two-way trade 
reached $1.96 billion. 
  In 1992, Australia was Indonesia's 11th largest export 
market. Its imports from Indonesia included synthetic fiber, 
shoes, wood products, rattan, textiles, coffee and rubber 
products.

  [Text] Jakarta -- Former leader of East Timor's Fretilin 
[Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor] security 
disturbance group Xanana Gusmao has asked the Indonesian Legal 
Aid Institute (YLBHI) and the National Commission on Human Right 
(Komnas HAM) to make sure that his rights as a prisoner are 
properly upheld. 
  "Although the government has lifted the visitation ban on 
me, 
I am still not allowed to be met by people outside my family. 
Many of my friends actually want to come and give support to 
me," Xanana said in broken Indonesian language at Cipinang 
Prison when being visited by members of the two organizations. 
  The former Fretilin leader is now serving 20 years of 
imprisonment. 
  He told members of the commission Marzuki Darusman, Bambang 
Suharto, Charles Himawan, and Clementino Dos Reis Amaral and 
lawyers of YLBHI Luhut Pangaribuan, Haryono Citrosubono, and 
Frans Hendra Winarta about his activities in prison. 
  Xanana said his activities were restricted and he was not 
allowed to read Indonesian magazines or newspapers. 
  Earlier, he said that he did not even know whether the 
visitation ban on him has been lifted. However, Marzuki 
Darusman said that it has and in principle he has been allowed 
to be visited. 
  Darusman explained that the ban was imposed following his 
letter to the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists 
in which he claimed his trial had been unfair. 
  However, Xanana responded that in fact he is still not 
allowed to be visited by people outside his family. 
  Responding to his complaint, Jakarta's head of Justice 
Office 
Alamsyah Bur, while there is no restriction to visit Xanana or 
any other political prisoners certain procedures have to be 
followed to ensure security of all prisoners. [sentence as 
published] 
  "Every visitor will be questioned aboout his or her reason 
to 
see the prisoners. We can't allow people visiting the prisoners 
if he or her has no certain reasons," Bur added. 
  Xanana also denied that he had appealed for clemency to 
Indonesia's president, Suharto, since he never admitted his 
Indonesian nationality. 
  He then wanted lawyers from YLBHI to represent him. 
  Xanana was captured in November 1992 and jailed for life 
which was later reduced to 20 years following his appeal for 
clemency. 
  He was sentenced on charges of heading an armed rebellion, 
plotting against the state, and illegal possession of firearms. 
  Luhut Pangaribuan, a lawyer from YLBHI who received Xanana's 
authorization to represent him, said that he would try to defend 
him as far as it was made possible by the country's legal system. 
  Marzuki Darusman stated the legal process on Xanana has come 
to the final stage and the punishment has been meted out. 
  "The commission will only observe whether his rights are 
respected. We will not interfere with the legal process," he 
added. 
  He also said that after seeing Xanana's prison facilities, 
the commission felt satisfied because everything was in 
accordance with minimum applicable standards.

  [Text] Jakarta, Republika -- The government seems to be 
making more serious efforts to improve the investment climate. 
The government's current step is unprecedented. Two laws which 
have regulated investment in Indonesia will be immediately 
revised and replaced with a new law. The old investment laws 
are no longer considered relevant with the current developments. 
  The laws which will be immediately revised are Law No. 
1/1967 
on foreign investment and Law No. 6/1968 on domestic investment. 
  When asked by reporters, Ir. [academic title] Sanyoto 
Sastrowardoyo, minister of state for investment affairs and 
chairman of the Investment Coordinating Board [BKPM], confirmed 
the planned revision of the two laws. "The plan is being 
discussed by ministers in charge of economy, finance, and 
development supervision," Sanyoto told reporters following an 
'Id-al Fitr get-together with the BKPM employees and their 
families in Jakarta on Friday (18 March). 
  According to Sanyoto, a special interdepartmental team will 
be set up to review the two laws. Indeed, it remains unclear 
who will chair the team because the matter will first be 
discussed during the initial meeting of the team. "A new law 
will be developed to replace the two laws if the team so 
decides," he said. The new law will combine the two old laws. 
  Sanyoto considers such a step very appropriate and part of 
efforts to improve the investment climate. Sanyoto believes 
that Indonesia should have a single investment law without 
sacrificing the interests and objectives of national development. 
  Furthermore, Sanyoto sees the review as very significant 
because the old laws have been in force for about 27 years. 
"The laws should be adjusted to the current situation," he 
said. Sanyoto hopes that the review will further accelerate 
investment in Indonesia. 
  Sanyoto denies that the step has been taken because the two 
laws are hampering current investment. "This is purely intended 
to suit globalization," he said. 
  According to Sanyoto, a number of neighboring countries 
closed themselves when the laws were made about 27 years ago. 
However, these countries, including India, Pakistan, and 
Cambodia have gradually started opening up. Some of them have 
even widely opened their doors to investment. 
  Sanyoto added that differences between foreign and domestic 
investment will be further narrowed. 
  For example, Article VI of the 1967 foreign investment law 
clearly states that such fields as ports, education, waterworks, 
railway, mass media, aviation, production of atomic energy, and 
the production and distribution of electricity for the public 
are closed to foreign investment. On the other hand, all fields 
are open to domestic investment. 
  Sanyoto, however, was unable to confirm when the review of 
the two laws will be over because it is a long process. An even 
longer process will be needed if the team decides to change the 
laws. "A long process is needed to change a law, including the 
consent of the House of Representatives," Sanyoto said. 
  In addition to reviewing the investment laws, the BKPM is 
preparing a new deregulation package. Sanyoto declined to 
reveal the package. However, he hinted that government decree 
No. 50/1993 on share ownership in foreign investment companies 
will be revised. 
  "Let us wait for a decision on this change," Sanyoto said. 
However, several circles said that the revision will cover 
several articles of the decree, including Article I on approval 
of a foreign investment project and Article III on conditions 
for establishing a foreign investment project.

  [Text] Jakarta, March 29 (AFP) -- Indonesian troops Tuesday 
detained students rallying in front of the Supreme Advisory 
Council (DPA) building to demand immediate action in an alleged 
430-million-dollar scam, the Antara news agency said. 
  The approximately 40 students were taken in for questioning 
after demonstrating for a quick handling of an alleged banking 
scam said to involve collusion between high officials and 
businessmen, Antara said. 
  The students were rounded up by a company of soldiers from 
the garrison in the Indonesian capital. 
  Antara said that the students, from two separate groups -- 
the Youth and Student Committee against Corruption and Collusion 
and the Representative Group of Universities Throughout 
Indonesia -- were whisked to the Central Jakarta Police station. 
  The agency said a duty officer at the police post, contacted 
by telephone, declined to give any information on the students. 
  The students were demanding that authorities quickly resolve 
the so-called Bapindo affair, named for the state-owned Bank 
Pembangunan Indonesia (Bapindo), which lost 613 million dollars 
after issuing business credits to an ethnic Chinese businessman. 
  They also demanded that several senior Bapindo officials be 
investigated. 
  Press reports since the disclosure of the scam in February 
have said several top officials of the bank are believed to be 
implicated in or have knowledge of the alleged scam. 
  Bapindo issued a letter of credit to Eddy Tansil's Golden 
Key 
group for the import of 430 million dollars in goods for five 
projects, but the document was later converted into a "red 
clause" letter of credit, under which the beneficiary can draw 
on the money though the goods have not yet been shipped, the 
attorney general's office said. 
  The credits have not been repaid, and interest and other 
charges have brought the total loss to 613 million dollars. 
  The attorney general has detained Tansil and three former 
high- ranking Bapindo executives for questioning and has 
scheduled a trial for Tansil next month. 
  The attorney general has also frozen the accounts of one of 
the bank's executives but none of the officials have so far been 
questioned in the case.

  [Text] Seoul, March 30 (YONHAP) -- Yi Yong-tok, deputy 
prime minister and National Unification minister, said Wednesday 
the government holds fast to the policy that the North Korean 
nuclear problem must be settled peacefully through dialogue and 
negotiation. 
  "There will be no change in this policy in the days to 
come," 
Yi said. 
  He made the remarks at a meeting with unification advisers, 
most of whom are former unification ministers. 
  "According to those who have recently been to North Korea, 
the economy there is deteriorating and the regime is controlling 
the people's lives more tightly than in the past," Yi said. 
  Also at the meeting, Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae 
said he expects multilateral efforts would be made to solve the 
nuclear problem through dialogue for a specific period of time 
after the United Nations Security Council takes an initial 
action against North Korea. 
  "It is possible that the United States and North Korea may 
engage in behind-the-scenes contacts," he said. 
  Song said North Korea may clarify its position on the 
nuclear 
problem and overall inter-Korean relations at a Supreme People's 
Assembly meeting to be held on April 6. 
  "In the North, public restlessness seems deepening. For 
instance, Army deserters are increasing and many workers boycott 
work or leave workshops earlier than usual," he said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 30 (YONHAP) -- North Korea is stepping 
up diplomacy toward third world countries in an apparent bid to 
win their support for its nuclear development program ahead of a 
non- aligned foreign ministers' meeting slated for May in Egypt. 
  In March alone Pyongyang has sent nine missions abroad, 
chiefly to non-aligned nations, with a view to easing 
international pressure for sanctions and avoiding full outside 
inspection of its nuclear facilities, according to the official 
North Korea watcher here, NAEWOE press. 
  Among the nine missions were three sent directly by the 
Foreign Ministry, each headed by a vice minister-level official. 
  One led by Kim Yong-il is traveling to West African 
countries: It has already visited Mali and Senegal and will 
proceed to Guinea and Ghana. 
  Another headed by Pak Myong-ku visited Mongolia, meeting the 
Mongolian premier in Ulaanbaatar last Friday, NAEWOE quoted 
North Korean media as reporting. 
  The third led by Kim Chang-kyu visited Thailand from March 
18-22 and Malaysia from March 25-28. Meeting the premiers and 
foreign ministers of these two countries, Kim reportedly 
explained North Korea's plans to leave the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) if Washington continues applying 
pressure. He is scheduled to visit Singapore from March 29-31 
and Indonesia from April 1-3. 
  Earlier, a Workers' Party mission headed by Secretary Hwang 
Chang-yop visited Vietnam and Laos. In a meeting with 
Vietnamese Communist Party leaders on March 7, Hwang sought to 
increase cooperation between the two countries and win 
Vietnamese support. In Laos, he met with Laotian political 
leaders on March 10. 
  Other missions sent overseas were led by Vice President Kim 
Pyong-sik, Education Commission Chairman Choe Ki-yong, Vice 
Premier Hong Song-nam, Supreme People's Assembly Secretariat 
Director Yi Mong-ho and Vice Information Committee Chairman Yi 
Pong-hui. 
  Vice President Kim's team is currently visiting Venezuela 
after stopping in Peru and Ecuador, while Education Commission 
Chairman Choe is in Syria as President Kim Il-song's special 
envoy after a trip to Egypt from March 20-23. 
  Vice Premier Hong is visiting Pakistan from March 25 to 
April 
13 to boost bilateral economic cooperation and seek Pakistani 
support in the nuclear row. 
  Heading the North Korean delegation to the 91st Inter- 
Parliamentary Union general meeting held in Paris, Supreme 
People's Assembly Secretariat Director Yi explained Pyongyang's 
position on the nuclear dispute in meetings with national 
delegations. 
  Joining in this diplomatic campaign to evade international 
pressure over the nuclear standoff are North Korean diplomats in 
Africa and Latin America, according to NAEWOE.

<F P=106> [Report by Yi Kwang-tok from Washington] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said that the third 
round of U.S.-North Korean talks will be held only if North 
Korea accepts additional inspections by a International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] team and complies with a North-South 
dialogue. In addition, he has refused North Korea's recent 
proposals to discuss the issue of the additional inspections at 
the third U.S.-North Korean talks. 
  Foreign Minister Han, who is now staying in Washington to 
seek joint measures for resolving the North Korean nuclear 
issue, made those remarks prior to a meeting with U.S. Secretary 
of State Christopher. He added that if North Korea does not 
accept the IAEA's request for additional inspections, the 
international community, including the United Nations, will have 
no choice other than imposing sanctions on North Korea. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said that if North Korea does 
not change its attitude but instead strongly reacts to the 
international community by withdrawing from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, the international community, including 
the ROK, the United States, and the United Nations, will respond 
strongly. 
  Foreign Minister Han said: During the ROK-PRC summit talks 
and the ROK-PRC foreign ministers' talks, China stressed that it 
would exercise influence over North Korea only if a phase of 
North-South dialogue continues. China has also asked the ROK 
side to create an atmosphere in which China can fully play a 
role in resolving the nuclear issue. 
  In addition, Foreign Minister Han said that he would meet 
with U.S. Secretary of State Christopher to discuss if the UN 
Security Council will adopt a statement in the name of its 
president or adopt a resolution. He stressed that if the UN 
Security Council adopts the statement, it will include the 
deadline for North Korean nuclear inspections and additional 
steps at the UN level. Foreign Minister Han is expected to meet 
UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and representatives of 
the permanent member states of the UN Security Council on 31 
March and ask for their cooperation.

  [Text] Washington, March 29 (YONHAP) -- Seoul and 
Washington will be coordinating the form and tone of the U.N. 
Security Council message on the North Korean nuclear wrangle at 
Thursday's [31 March] foreign ministers' meeting. 
  Visiting South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu meets 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and sources say they 
are likely to agree on issuing a statement by the council 
president rather than adopting a resolution -- but carrying the 
same strength in tone. 
  Han told Korean reporters that if the council opts for a 
presidential statement, all permanent members including China 
will speak in favor with North Korea the only country opposing 
it. 
  "This will make public the fact that China is on our side," 
Han said. 
  But he suggested that the tone of the statement should be 
stronger than what China has proposed, putting in print the 
deadline by when North Korea should allow international 
inspection of its nuclear facilities and a warning on sanctions 
if Pyongyang fails to comply. 
  On whether Seoul and Washington would resume their joint 
military maneuvers, Team Spirit, Han said the United States has 
always respected Seoul's position and decisions. 
  "This time, we would be asking what Washington thinks 
instead 
of consulting them on our own position," Han said.

  [Text] Washington, March 29 (YONHAP) -- The UN Security 
Council may not be able to secure a result at Thursday's session 
on the North Korean nuclear problem due to a dispute between 
China and the four other permanent members, sources here said 
Tuesday. 
  The presidential statement demanded by China significantly 
tones down the message and excludes an inspection deadline and 
any mention of possible sanctions, they said. 
  A closed-door session is scheduled for Thursday at the 
United 
Nations, where the United States may decide to push for a 
resolution as it first planned, according to the sources. 
  The council had been expected to reach a final agreement at 
Thursday's session, but that may be impossible due to the 
dispute among its members, they said. 
  The U.S.-proposed draft resolution gives North Korea one 
month to accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) and warns of "further steps" if Pyongyang refuses, 
referring to economic sanctions. 
  China has opposed such a resolution and proposed a 
presidential statement instead.

<F P=106> [REUTER/YONHAP from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] Kim Kwang-sop, North Korean ambassador to Austria, 
said today that North Korea will permit progress in the nuclear 
inspection [haek sacharul chinjonsikinun de tongui] only when 
the United States holds the third round of talks with it. 
  In an interview with REUTER, Ambassador Kim insisted that 
the 
best way to resolve the nuclear issue is to hold high-level 
talks between North Korea and the United States. 
  The third round of U.S.-North Korean talks was supposed to 
be 
held in Geneva last week but was canceled because North Korea 
did not allow the International Atomic Energy Agency inspection 
team to conduct an overall inspection of major nuclear 
facilities in Yongbyon.

<F P=106> [Report by Kim Chin-ha from UN Headquarters in New York] </F>
  [Text] On 30 March North Korea proposed resuming dialogue 
with the United States to resolve the present deadlocked nuclear 
issue. A spokesman from the North Korean mission to the United 
Nations said in a statement that North Korea wants to resolve 
the nuclear issue by dialogue, not by armed forces. In 
particular, it expects the issue to be settled within the 
framework of proposals made by President Clinton in his news 
conference on 24 March. 
  In his news conference held last week, President Clinton 
said 
that the United States wants to maintain normal relations with 
North Korea and that if North Korea abides by the international 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, its future will be brighter. 
  Quoting remarks by a North Korean diplomat, THE NEW YORK 
TIMES also reported today that unofficial working-level contacts 
between the United States and North Korea are presently being 
held at the United Nations, and that an official channel has 
also been opened between the United States and North Korea. 
  The paper reported, however, that a U.S. envoy to the United 
Nations and a spokesman for the U.S. State Department had 
strongly denied the rumors regarding the U.S.-North Korean 
contacts.

  [Text] Washington, March 29 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has 
indirectly proposed that it will allow International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) checks of seven nuclear facilities only 
after a third round of high-level talks with the United States. 
  One senior official at the North Korean Mission to the 
United 
Nations in New York said Tuesday that the original agreements 
reached between North Korea and the United States and North 
Korea and the IAEA called for a comprehensive IAEA inspection of 
only five of the seven sites. 
  As for the other two facilities -- a 5-megawatt reactor and 
a 
radiochemical laboratory -- North Korea had agreed to accept 
IAEA inspections that are necessary only to maintain continuity 
in nuclear safeguards, the official claimed. 
  The question of permitting comprehensive IAEA inspections of 
all seven facilities in North Korea, a member of the nuclear 
non- proliferation treaty (NPT), must be resolved at the third 
round of high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington, he 
said. 
  The official, who declined to be identified by name, said 
the 
United States is reportedly planning to raise the question of 
special checks of the two facilities at the talks. 
  The U.S. position mirrors that of a hostile country 
demanding 
that the other side publicly disclose its military technology, 
the official said. He thus ruled out the possibility that the 
IAEA may conduct special inspections. 
  The official also demanded that the United States not attach 
any preconditions to further dialogue. 
  "The United States has to give up the idea that U.S.-North 
Korean talks are some kind of present (to Pyongyang)," he said. 
"In fact, we do not feel an urgent need for dialogue with the 
United States." 
  The official's comments confirm widely held suspicions that 
much time and effort are needed to resolve the issue since South 
Korea, the United States and their allies are demanding that 
North Korea permit IAEA inspections immediately while Pyongyang 
is seeking further talks with Washington first.

  [Text] Quoting Chinese sources, ASAHI SHIMBUN said in a 
report dispatched from Beijing today that North Korea's Kim 
Il-song will not visit China until the nuclear issue is resolved. 
  According to these sources, China understands that Kim 
Il-song has virtually refused to visit China. 
  In the opinion of the Beijing sources, Kim Il-song is wary 
of 
the possibility that China might claim credit if the nuclear 
issue were resolved after he visited China because it would seem 
to have been resolved due to China's persuasion.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 30 (YONHAP) -- North Korean President 
Kim Il-song has notified China that he will not pay a visit 
until the nuclear dispute is resolved, the ASAHI SHIMBUN 
reported from Beijing on Wednesday. 
  The paper quoted a source in Beijing as saying that China, 
which had earlier invited Kim, accepted the notification as a 
refusal of its invitation. 
  The source was quoted as saying that North Korea is worried 
about giving the impression that it fell under China's sway if 
the nuclear problem had been resolved after Kim's visit. 
  Kim is especially conscious of South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam's trip to China and might have decided not to visit 
Beijing in order to show that Chinese influence on North Korea 
has its limits, the source said. 
  China, through a Communist party delegation which visited 
Pyongyang late last month, invited Kim Il-song to come for 
discussions on the nuclear issue as well as reform and opening, 
according to the paper. 
  Given the close relationship between the two countries, 
China's announcement on the invitation was exceptional, 
according to the source. 
  ASAHI said China judged that Kim Il-song had come to the 
conclusion that if he visited Beijing before the nuclear problem 
was resolved, other countries would have the impression that 
North Korea yielded to Chinese pressure. 
  Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said at a 
press conference that Kim Il-song does not plan to visit China 
in the near future. 
  China opposes economic sanctions against North Korea because 
if such strong action was taken, the North might attack the 
South in a final bid to survive, the Chinese source explained.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
editorials carried by ROK vernacular newspapers on 30 March 
commenting on the ROK-China discussion on the North Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "Does Our Position on the North Korean 
Nuclear Issue Change Again?". 
  The editorial refers to Chinese President Jiang Zemin's 
opposition to the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise and the 
deployment of Patriot missiles during his talks with ROK 
President Kim Yong-sam and writes: "This again shows that China 
consistently supports North Korea's position regarding the 
nuclear issue." The editorial asks the ROK Government to 
elaborate on what Jiang actually told President Kim Yong-sam 
during the talks and how the ROK responded to Jiang's remarks. 
  The editorial describes China's passive attitude toward 
international efforts to ensure North Korea's nuclear 
transparency and writes: "China turns a blind eye to the North 
Korean nuclear issue, which constitutes the most grave challenge 
to a post-cold war world, but intervenes, unfairly, into the 
ROK's defensive Team Spirit exercise and the deployment of 
Patriot missiles. We cannot understand this." The editorial 
writes the ROK's diplomacy has "lost its balance" by blindly 
believing that the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise may 
lead North Korea to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty or that the adoption of a resolution at the UN Security 
Council may incite North Korea. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 a 800-word 
editorial entitled "Truth and Falsehood of Chinese-Style 
Solutions." 
  Citing the fact that President Kim Yong-sam stressed the 
nuclear issue during his visit to Japan, while stressing 
economic cooperation during his visit to China, the editorial 
writes: "Even though the leaders of Japan and China may have 
felt comfortable because of such an attitude, President Kim 
Yong-sam failed to make the valuable opportunities to meet with 
the leaders of the two countries more valuable." Describing the 
U.S.-DPRK talks, a package deal, and the use of persuasion 
regarding the North Korean nuclear issue as "Chinese-style 
solutions," the editorial writes that China's opposition to some 
points in a statement of the UN Security Council chairman is 
"disappointing" and describes China's opposition to the 
resumption of the Team Spirit exercise and the deployment of 
Patriot missiles during the summit talks as an "almost 
uncourteous act." The editorial concludes: "We are under the 
impression that our government relies on the Chinese-style 
solutions too heavily. It is necessary to examine whether China 
is using the North Korean nuclear issue as its diplomatic card." 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "Why Does the Policy on the North Korean 
Nuclear Issue Change Again?". 
  The editorial first describes the ROK's acceptance of 
China's 
preference for dialogue and its logic that "no one must incite 
North Korea" and writes that this means that the ROK was 
"persuaded" by China, instead of persuading China to accept the 
ROK's view. The editorial writes: "The ROK Government may have 
its own reason to change its nuclear policies. However, we 
cannot but express our worry that the chaos at home and abroad 
caused by this policy change may weaken the ROK's 
trustworthiness and cause a confusion in the security structure." 
  Citing ROK Ambassador to China Hwang Pyong-tae's remarks on 
the ROK's decision to discuss the nuclear issue with China, in 
addition to the United States, and to take joint action, the 
editorial writes this is "shocking" and may cause a "mess" in 
the ROK's diplomatic axis centering on the United States and 
Japan. After writing that all powerful countries in the ROK's 
neighborhood are competing to intervene in Korean peninsula 
affairs, the editorial concludes: "We already learned a century 
ago what invited competition among the powerful countries in our 
neighborhood and what resulted from that competition. Our 
country must not tremble in dealing with such important 
diplomatic issues as the North Korean nuclear issue."

<F P=106> [Speech by President Kim Yong-sam upon his return from Japan </F>
and China at Seoul Airport -- live] 
  [Text] My dear fellow countrymen: I have just returned 
home after concluding my six-night-and-seven-day visits to Japan 
and China. With the encouragement of you, fellow countrymen, I 
have returned after explaining to the people of the two 
countries the vision of the ROK, which is leaping forward afresh 
by making changes and reforms. 
  My just concluded visits have given the ROK an opportunity 
to 
open an Asian-Pacific era with Japan and China. I have opened a 
new horizon in ROK-Japanese cooperation and ROK-Sino cooperation. 
  During my visits, I sincerely discussed with Japanese and 
Chinese leaders security and prosperity in Northeast Asia, the 
North Korean nuclear issue, and other practical matters 
concerning common prosperity. 
  I tell you, my fellow countrymen, that as a result, I have 
won much sympathy from those leaders. 
  I held two rounds of talks with Prime Minister Hosokawa in 
Tokyo. We extensively discussed ways to expand bilateral 
cooperation in a changing world. I presented the future of new 
good-neighborly relations in a speech at a banquet hosted by the 
Japanese emperor and speeches to the Japanese Diet and Waseda 
University. I proposed opening an era of ROK-Japanese 
cooperation to shape the future based on historical lessons and 
mutual trust. I won absolute sympathy from them. 
  Looking toward the 21st century, ROK-Japanese relations have 
entered an era of cooperation. 
  Following my visit to Japan, I visited China, one of our 
three major trading partners. I held talks with Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin and frankly discussed with him bilateral 
cooperation, peace and prosperity in the Asian-Pacific region, 
and the North Korean nuclear issue and other matters concerning 
security and peace on the Korean peninsula. 
  President Jiang Zemin and I agreed that peace and security 
on the Korean peninsula is a prerequisite, not only for the 
interest of the two countries of the ROK and China, but also for 
peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia. We also agreed that 
peace and security on the Korean peninsula will greatly 
contribute to world peace without fail. 
  My visit to China further promoted the exchange of friendly 
relations between the two countries. Moreover, it was an 
opportunity for coexistence that provided a basis for active 
economic cooperation. In particular, we agreed to carry out 
active industrial cooperation in various fields, including the 
automobile, electronic exchanger, airplane, and high definition 
television industries. When considering the infinite potential 
of the ROK and China, this kind of escalated cooperation will 
indeed guarantee a bright future in the relations between the 
two countries. 
  While making a speech at Beijing University, I emphasized 
the 
importance of mutual complementary cooperative relations between 
the ROK and China. To achieve this, I stressed the fact that 
establishing peace and reunification on the Korean peninsula are 
very important for peace and prosperity in this region. The 
professors and students of Beijing University expressed 
consensus through enthusiastic applause on my speech. In Japan 
and China, I was able to confirm an extensive consensus on our 
reform. 
  Dear fellow countrymen: During my visits, I met with many 
fellow countrymen living in Japan and China and our businessmen. 
They had great pride in the fatherland's status, which was 
further enhanced through change and reform. They were 
overflowing with patriotic enthusiasm for the fatherland's 
development and for internationalization. 
  When I visited the ROK provisional government building in 
Shanghai, I felt all the more keenly the will of the patriotic 
forefathers' spirit of independence and proud construction of 
the fatherland. 
  During my visit to ROK businesses in the Tianjin 
development zone this morning, I could keenly feel their resolve 
to advance into the open Chinese continent and thus promote 
ROK-PRC cooperation. 
  Fellow countrymen: We should all turn our eyes to the future 
and the world without delay. We should all rise up to pioneer 
the national fate. 
  During my visit I saw Japan, which is ahead of others, and 
witnessed that China is about to burp [yongturimulhanun]. I 
also actually felt that the world is rapidly changing and saw 
countries striving to survive severe competition. They are all 
heading toward the future with a determined resolve. In 
particular, I saw the youth of China and Japan throwing off the 
old and leaping forward to the future. 
  I desperately feel that to win the economic and technologic 
war in an era of limitless competition, we should look directly 
at the ROK's present situation and redouble our efforts. In the 
current world, which is rapidly changing, stagnation means 
self-destruction, not retreat. 
  If we do not change, we will remain as an eternal straggler. 
The efforts for change, reforms, and internalization should be 
continued without a hitch. We should not miss the opportunity 
to reform. We cannot survive severe competition if we remain as 
a frog in a narrow well. 
  We must start fresh with a new resolve toward a ROK that 
stands proudly on the international arena. We must build a 
great country. We must hand over a proud country to our sons and 
daughters. Our fellow countrymen have the courage, latent 
energy, and self- confidence to build such a country. Tomorrow 
will be too late, we must start today. 
  Fellow countrymen: We should renew our march. Thank you.

  [Text] Seoul, March 28 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and China on 
Monday agreed to make joint studies for environmental protection 
and undertake other schemes to beef up bilateral technical 
cooperation. 
  An official at the Ministry of Science and Technology said 
the agreement was made at a meeting in Beijing between South 
Korean Science and Technology Minister Kim Si-chung and his 
Chinese counterpart, Song Jian, minister of the State Science 
and Technology Commission. 
  Minister Kim was in Beijing as a member of the official 
suite 
of President Kim Yong-sam presently on a state visit to China. 
  As an initial project of joint environmental programs, the 
two countries would soon inaugurate a joint Yellow Sea study 
team to work out ways to control Yellow Sea contamination. 
  In the aeronautical area, South Korea and China would 
jointly 
develop knowhow on airplane design with a view to producing 
mid-sized airplanes in a joint scheme. 
  Also at Monday's meeting, the two ministers decided to 
exchange 30 technicians between their countries this year 
instead of 15 and step up cooperation in the area of elementary 
science. 
  They further agreed to conclude a Korea-China atomic energy 
agreement and an atomic energy safeguards memorandum at the 
second Korea-China joint Science and Technology Committee 
meeting slated for October this year in Seoul, the official said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Yi Chang-sop] </F>
  [Text] From next month, American investors will be able to 
trade Korean stocks in the United States by investing in 
depositary receipts (DRs), which are negotiable certificates of 
publicly traded shares on the Seoul stock exchange, the Ministry 
of Finance said. 
  The MOF [Ministry of Finance] permitted 250 blue chip 
companies out of 699 listed on the Korea Stock Exchange to issue 
to Americans the dollar-denominated DRs, taking the already -- 
circulating issues as security. 
  With the U.S. trading of the Korean DRs, American investors 
will not need to bother to register with Korean regulators, get 
an identification card (ID) here and directly invest in Korean 
stocks on the Korea Stock Exchange even at the risk of currency 
fluctuation, the MOF said. 
  The DRs traded in the United States are the same as their 
underlying stocks traded in Korea, except for the fact that DRs 
are certificates of home-country stocks. Thus dual prices for 
the single company issue may exist following the government 
permission of DRs in the United States. 
  One major difference is that DRs are denominated in dollars 
and traded outside Korea but their underlying stocks are traded 
in Korean won on the Korea Stock Exchange. Holders of DRs can 
not exercise voting rights. 
  Thus, Korean blue chip issues can be traded both in Korea 
and 
the United States, which will help local companies enhance their 
image and understanding of their products and services overseas. 
  The DR issuance does not involve capital inflow into Korea. 
It helps foreigners holding Korean stocks liquidate their 
holding by issuing DRs to American investors in the United 
States. 
  The MOF said local companies will be able to issue DRs 
within 
10 percent of their outstanding issues, in keeping with the 
nation's 10 percent foreign ownership ceiling of individual 
issues. 
  It said in line with the expansion of the foreign stock 
ownership ceiling, the government will raise the DR issuance 
quota, the MOF said. 
  To bypass cumbersome disclosure and registration 
requirements 
in the United States, Korean firms will initially issue DRs 
outside the U.S. stock exchanges, meaning the trading of Korean 
DRs in the Over- the-Counter (OTC) market. 
  But if DR issuers meet the U.S. disclosure and accounting 
rules, these Korean companies can list their DRs on the U.S. 
stock exchanges. 
  The MOF said three major U.S. banks -- Bank of New York, 
Citibank and Morgan Guaranty Bank -- monopolize the DR issuance 
processing. 
  Since the middle of the 1980s, a selected number of Korean 
companies have issued DRs in major foreign capital markets when 
they "newly" issued equities. When DRs are issued at the time 
of new share offering, the issuers can raise fresh capital from 
foreigners. But Korean companies have been prohibited from 
issuing DRs on the back of "old" issues now circulating in the 
domestic stock market. 
  DRs are created when U.S. brokers buy the Korean company's 
shares in Seoul and deliver those shares to the Korea Securities 
Settlement Corp. (KSSC), the custodian bank, which then 
instructs the depositary bank (Bank of New York or Citibank) in 
Seoul to issue DRs to the U.S. investors. 
  These DRs are freely traded just as any other U.S. stock. 
They are priced and quoted in U.S. dollars, are traded on 
either an exchange or the Over-the-Counter (OTC) market and 
settled according to U.S. standards, a Bank of New York official 
in Seoul said. 
  MOF's Securities Policy Division Director Sin Tong-kyu said 
the government restricted the number of DR issuers to one-third 
of all listed companies in Korea because it does not want to 
spoil Korea's image when unknown small companies go bankrupt. 
  Eligible DR issuers are those with net worth of more than 20 
billion won or paid-in capital of 10 billion won, the MOF said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 30 (YONHAP) -- The ubiquitous badge 
featuring North Korean President Kim Il-song has disappeared 
from the lapels of North Korean officials attending 
international conferences, fueling speculation as to what it 
signifies. 
  Rep. Pak Chung-su, who led a South Korean delegation to the 
91st International Parliamentary Union (IPU) meeting in Paris, 
said Wednesday he noticed that all nine members of the North 
Korean delegation had not sported the Kim Il-song badge. 
  In addition, all six North Korean representatives at another 
Paris meeting of the United Nations Educational, Social and 
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) did not wear the badge, according 
to Pak. 
  The absence of the badge, the symbol of Kim Il-song's 
"chuche" (self-reliance) ideology, is drawing unusual attention 
because all North Korean officials had until recently worn it as 
though it were a bodily appendage, Pak said. 
  "It is a big change, considering the rigidity and 
inflexibility of the North Korean regime and society," Pak added. 
  Pak speculated that North Korea's leaders may be preparing 
"a 
grace period" during a transition of power from Kim Il-song to 
his son and heir-apparent, Kim Chong-il.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Song Yong-tae, vice minister of </F>
the National Unification Board and chief South delegate to the 
North-South working-level delegates contact, by Hwang Chae-hong, 
head of TONG-A ILBO political department, at Song's office in 
the Unified Government Building -- date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Hwang Chae-hong] There are 
rumors that the Korean peninsula is in a crisis due to the 
rupture of the South-North dialogue. What is the true nature of 
this matter? 
  [Song Yong-tae] It is a fact that North Korea increased its 
military exercises by 50 percent and that it is strengthening 
air defense exercises around Pyongyang and Yongbyon. Normally 
at this time, North Korea would be making a fuss in preparing 
for Kim Il- song's birthday, 15 April. This year, however, 
rather than concentrating on preparations for Kim Il-song's 
birthday, it is exerting efforts in the production of military 
supplies, such as military uniforms. North Korea is increasing 
domestic tension. No special signs of military provocation have 
been detected. 
  [Hwang] How do you analyze North Korea's ulterior motives in 
making violent remarks, such as it will be ready for war? 
  [Song] When analyzing North Korea's intentions in detail, it 
seems that this kind of remark was made as a warning to the 
international community, which is showing moves toward sanctions 
against North Korea. Also, this is to consolidate internal 
solidarity, and assumes a psychological characteristic to 
agitate the South from within. In particular, the nuclear card 
is a very important strategy for its existence. If the 
effectiveness of the nuclear card is diminished, North Korea has 
no other alternative. Therefore, it seems that to maintain 
nuclear suspicion to some degree, North Korea ruptured the 
South-North dialogue and insincerely accepted inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. [end Song] 
  He emphasized that regardless of rumors of a crisis on the 
Korean peninsula, "the people are not agitated and are able to 
maintain their positions, which proves that the people's 
awareness has increased and that this will act as a strong 
message to North Korea." 
  [Hwang] Ordinarily, the content of North-South dialogue is 
not made public. What was the reason for publicizing the 
content of the recent North-South dialogue? Comments have been 
made that making public the content of the contact may have 
amplified the people's uneasiness. 
  [Song] As this is an issue related to the country's 
security, I felt that it was necessary to let the people know 
the content of the working-level delegates contact. It is in 
line with the reasoning that when a fire breaks out, it is 
necessary to let the people in the surrounding area know that a 
fire has broken out. It was a decision made by the National 
Unification Board [NUB] after consulting with related 
ministries. We also considered the fact that if we did not make 
public the content of the contact, there was a possibility that 
North Korea might have made it public to the people first. 
North Korea has a past record of publicizing the whole content 
of the sixth working-level contact. [end Song] 
  When asked if making public the content of the contact, 
which 
was unprecedented, was used to achieve change in the current 
situation, such as to overcome the problem of price instability, 
NUB Vice Minister Song strongly said: "It is unthinkable for 
the civilian- ruled government to use the reunification issue 
internally." [passage omitted] 
  [Hwang] What is the future schedule surrounding the North 
Korean nuclear issue? 
  [Song] It seems that a statement by the president of the UN 
Security Council [UNSC] or a resolution by the UNSC urging North 
Korea to accept nuclear inspections will be adopted soon. Then, 
the scenario will change in accordance with how the situation 
develops between dialogue and sanctions. If the situation turns 
to dialogue, dialogue can be carried out between the United 
States and North Korea, and between the IAEA and North Korea. 
However, if the situation turns to sanctions, the intensity of 
the sanctions will be strengthened gradually. 
  [Hwang] If UNSC economic sanctions are applied against 
North Korea, many people predict that our economy will be 
considerably weakened because of a sense of uneasiness. Also, 
because of military tension, it seems that consumption of 
national power will be great. What is the government's position 
on economic sanctions against North Korea? 
  [Song] If a resolution is adopted at the UNSC on applying 
economic sanctions against North Korea, we will agree to it. Of 
course, we will open our doors for dialogue. We hope that North 
Korea will respond to dialogue before sanctions are applied. We 
will carry out diplomatic efforts regarding this matter. 
  [Hwang] People point out that we do not have a sufficient 
card to lure North Korea into holding North-South dialogue. 
Therefore, have we even reached the point of requesting the 
United States to ask North Korea to resume North-South dialogue? 
  [Song] Basically, North Korea views North-South dialogue as 
a political struggle, not negotiations. Therefore, if it is not 
of their interest, North Korea will not respond to our efforts, 
however we try. When considering such an attitude by North 
Korea, we can say that we have such cards as the Team Spirit 
exercise, the third round of U.S.-DPRK talks, and North-South 
economic cooperation. 
  [Hwang] If North Korea shows change in its attitude now and 
agrees to receive additional IAEA inspections and shows 
sincerity in North-South dialogue, will our side once again 
withdraw our plan to resume the Team Spirit exercise this year? 
  [Song] The condition for suspending the Team Spirit exercise 
is for North Korea to receive IAEA inspections and realize the 
exchange of special envoys of the North and South. Since these 
two conditions were not met, this year's Team Spirit exercise 
will be carried out. The time for holding the exercise will be 
decided upon after President Kim Yong-sam returns from his visit 
to China. 
  [Hwang] While holding a news conference with ROK 
correspondents in Japan, President Kim said that 'there are 
unusual signs in Kim Chong-il's succession system.' In this 
connection, what are signs that can be viewed in North Korea? 
  [Song] When synthesizing information obtained through 
various channels, there are signs that there are problems in Kim 
Chong-il's succession system. Because of this, we can sense 
that there is confusion in North Korea's policy on the nuclear 
issue and its policy on the South. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By researcher Yu Yong-ku] </F>
  [Text] North Korea still seems to have no intention 
of holding a North-South Summit Meeting. It characterizes the 
Kim Yong-sam administration as a "slavish, pro-American regime 
no different than the succession of military regimes [preceding 
it]" and is concentrating its efforts on North Korean-U.S. 
negotiations. We take a look at the North Korean [NK] 
unification policy and foreign policy for the new year. 
  It is uncertain just when it began, but we have come to ask 
the question every New Year: "Will a North-South summit meeting 
materialize this year?" The mood neglects questions of what a 
summit meeting would be for, what it would deal with, and what 
role it would play in the realization of unification; rather, 
interest centers merely on whether it will be held. Recent 
discussion is no exception. Under the hasty expectation that 
with the seeming improvement in NK-U.S. nuclear negotiations the 
North-South dialogue too would begin to improve, vague 
observations are being made on the possibility that a summit 
meeting would be held within the year. 
  Summit-related questions were asked at President Kim 
Yong-sam's New Year's news conference on January 6th, it too 
being no exception. "We must not have a summit meeting just to 
have a summit meeting. What is more, there is no reason we 
cannot hold talks with President Kim Il-song. For this, however, 
a few problems about which we are talking must be solved," 
answered President Kim. This answer was prepared in advance and 
can be viewed as the administration's official position. In 
short, this means that, for a summit meeting, preconditions, 
such as North-South mutual nuclear inspections to guarantee 
nuclear transparency, must first be met. 
  "This is not the stage for saying anything concrete, but NK 
has started to change," said President Kim in a news conference 
late last year, "It is believed that next year will be an 
important turning point in North-South relations." The nuance of 
the president's statement given on January 6th was entirely 
different from this optimism. It gives the feeling that he is 
putting more importance on the fulfillment of preconditions. 
Last year's optimistic statement is seemingly related to what 
NK's Kim Il-song revealed on December 25th in his meeting with 
UN Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali: "We are willing to pursue a 
North-South exchange of special envoys." 
  The situation changed this year, however. A statement given 
in a news conference by deputy prime minister and unification 
minister Yi Yong-tok, the day before the president's New Year's 
news conference, needs to be carefully examined. Saying, "The 
time has come to talk about NK's human-rights problem," he 
goaded NK's Achilles heel. It is difficult to view this as just 
a statement made in passing. It gives the impression that they 
are aiming for something. "A meeting itself must not be the goal 
of the North-South relationship. It is important to develop it 
into a substantial relationship," said Deputy Prime Minister Yi, 
adding, "Even if NK should propose talks, it is our plan to 
reject this unconditionally if it doesn't fit the principles of 
the administration." Anyone can read this emphasis on 
"principle" as a "hard-line posture toward the North." It can be 
viewed as a response to the "hard-line statement toward the 
South" given by Kim Il-song in his New Year's address. The 
nuance of the statement by Yi is different from the original 
mood of government authorities, who had been optimistic that if 
a NK-U.S. agreement were concluded, North-South working-level 
talks for an exchange of special envoys would be held. 
  O this issue, NK, in a report by the secretariat of the 
Committee For the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland 
[CPRF] given on January 7th, criticized Deputy Prime Minister Yi 
as "the one who desecrated the rights of our young students," 
pointing to the fact that when visiting Pyongyang as the chief 
representative of the South Korean [SK] delegation to the 1985 
9th North-South Red Cross Talks, Yi had been watching group 
gymnastics by a team of youth, but left in the middle of the 
event. "In the future, people like Deputy Prime Minister Yi 
won't be able to step even one foot into the area of our 
republic," the report said, showing a hard-line stance. The CPRF 
also added a warning that if another statement is made like that 
of Deputy Prime Minister Yi, "The North-South relationship may 
be confronted by a situation difficult to get under control." 
  However, authorities at our Foreign Ministry, carefully 
watching the developments of NK-U.S. contact, predict that if in 
early January progress is made on nuclear inspections between NK 
and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), their is a 
high probability that a North-South working-level contact will 
be held around the end of January. They also foresaw the 
possibility that even the time for a North-South exchange of 
special envoys would be decided at the NK-U.S. talks. This is 
reading the mood optimistically. Considering the mutually 
contradictory stances taken by the [SK] authorities, it is 
unclear whether their basic position is one of actively pursuing 
talks (including a conciliatory posture toward the North) or 
whether it is one which stresses principle and takes a passive 
approach to talks. 
  Although it may seem somewhat hasty, let us consider the 
prospects for a North-South summit meeting within the year. To 
put our conclusion first, "A summit within the year is 
impossible because of many problems and because of the divergent 
positions of the North and South." 
  Why is this so? We will first examine the reasons for this, 
then take an overall look at NK's policies toward the South, the 
U.S. and Japan this year. 
  In connection with the observation that if the IAEA 
inspection team is allowed to visit NK, working-level contact 
for a North-South exchange of special envoys will begin, first, 
it is questionable that at the present stage NK will actually 
consent to working-level talks. Of course, our government 
authorities can be positive about working-level contacts. For 
NK, however, if there is a little progress in solving the 
nuclear issue through NK-U.S. negotiations, its incentive for 
responding to working-level contact weakens. It is clear that 
even if it is firmly decided that SK-U.S. Team Spirit exercises 
will be discontinued, NK will not think conditions have been met 
for North-South working-level contacts. It will again demand of 
SK that it give up dependence on foreign powers under the name 
of "abandoning the system of international cooperation," an 
expression of the intent to withdraw U.S. troops, to permanently 
discontinue joint military exercises with foreign military 
units, etc. 
  Even if NK agrees to working-level contacts because of the 
strong U.S. demand for it, there is a high probability that it 
will only be a formality, even more so than the working-level 
contact last October. This is because it appears NK will not 
back away from its basic position concerning the duties of the 
special envoys. Compared to our position that the nuclear 
problem should be solved first and other outstanding issues 
discussed, NK will want to deal in parallel with the performance 
of denuclearization and the relaxation of tensions (leading into 
a demand for arms reduction), planning to promote national 
solidarity (leading into a demand for a federation-type 
unification), and a North-South summit meeting. The disputed 
points of the special-envoy-exchange agenda are unlikely to be 
easily resolved and the exchange itself is unlikely to be 
realized. 
  Thus, there are limits to the optimistic view that things 
will work out in the order of a NK-IAEA agreement, a third round 
of NK-U.S. talks, a North-South special-envoy exchange (or with 
a North-South special-envoy exchange coming before a third round 
of NK-U.S. talks). 
  Although there is little possibility it will happen, if 
within the year all conditions are met and there is an exchange 
of special envoys and a summit meeting, NK's President Kim 
Il-song will use the summit meeting to call for the immediate 
realization of "a federal system based on the idea of one 
people, one nation, two systems and two governments, national 
solidarity (the issue of economic cooperation will also be 
mentioned in this framework), and peaceful arms reduction from 
the principle of autonomy. A summit meeting is unlikely, but if 
it does come about, NK will next seek contact talks with figures 
from each sector of SK from a "national-solidarity" standpoint 
Seen in this way, NK's thinking is completely different from 
that of our government, which has no intention of backing away 
from its aim of "window unification" for the North-South 
dialogue. 
  Also, it is the thinking of our government to respond 
positively to calls for North-South economic cooperation if NK 
"nuclear transparency" is guaranteed, but it is difficult to 
hope for the kind of "complete resolution of the nuclear 
question" wanted by our government. In its negotiations with NK, 
even the U.S. is pouring all its efforts into binding NK, no 
matter what, to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and 
at least getting an IAEA nuclear inspection. For the present, 
the special inspection of two unreported facilities (NK insists 
they are "military facilities") for which SK, the U.S. and the 
IAEA had originally intended to push hard, seems to be out of 
reach. Prospects are that the more this issue is brought up, the 
more the rounds of fighting surrounding the NK nuclear question 
will be repeated. Given this situation, the Kim Yong-sam 
administration is unlikely to hurry a North-South summit meeting 
and it appears that the road toward a summit meeting will feel 
that much more distant. 
  Moreover, suggesting that he has no intention of carrying on 
a dialogue with the Kim Yong-sam government, President Kim 
Il-song's New Year's address further dims prospects for a summit. 
  "We hoped the SK authorities would respond to our 
National-Solidarity 10-Point Program and walk the road of 
reconciliation and cooperation, and we also took important 
measures concerning the exchange of special envoys to take place 
between the highest levels of the two sides. The SK authorities, 
however, ignoring our generous offers and the cherished desire 
for unification of the whole Korean people, is walking the road 
not of national autonomy, but of dependence of foreign powers, 
not of national unity, but of North-South confrontation," said 
[NK's] President Kim last year, strongly criticizing the Kim 
Yong-sam administration's posture toward the North. "Joining 
with foreign powers, the SK authorities frequently carry out 
large-scale military exercises opposing our republic and, using 
our nuclear problem as an excuse, talks of military 
confrontation and a system of international cooperation, driving 
the North-South relationship into a perilous situation," he 
added. 
  These statements attract attention because they show that NK 
understands our government to be a "pro-American flunkyist 
regime" and that as long as there is no change in this posture, 
it has no intention of taking part in an inter-Korean dialogue. 
This is a 180-degree change from the "sense of expectation" 
shown by NK Prime Minister Kang Song-san last year after the 
birth of the Kim Yong-sam administration, when President Kim 
stated, "The interests of the Korean people come before allies." 
  This year's New Year's address was exceptional in that 
[NK's] 
President Kim did not include a proposal aimed at our 
government. In last year's New Year's address, even while 
criticizing our government for its "antinational behavior," 
because it obstructed the implementation of the North-South 
Basic Agreement and reopened Team Spirit exercises, as if having 
the newly born Kim Yong-sam administration in mind, he stated, 
"No matter who they may be, if someone comes out with a sincere 
attitude, genuinely wanting to solve the problems of the 
unification of the Fatherland, we will sit down with them 
face-to-face and frankly discuss the problems of the unification 
of the Korean people, without bringing up the past, and endeavor 
together to achieve the great work of the unification of the 
Fatherland." One can feel the extreme distance between the two 
addresses. We are reminded again that the adoption of the 
"National-Solidarity 10-Point Program" in the 5th Session of the 
9th Supreme People's Assembly held in April and the proposal 
immediately following it in May for an exchange of special 
envoys to prepare for a North-South summit meeting were possible 
because statements of this tone were in last year's New Year's 
address. 
  This year, not only did Kim fail to make any proposals 
toward 
our government, but he did not hesitate to make statements which 
seem to indicate that he has given up his "original sense of 
expectation" in the Kim Yong-sam administration. "The so-called 
civilian government of SK is only a facade: in actuality it is 
no different from the succession of military dictatorships 
[which preceded it]. Anticommunist, fascist, evil laws remain 
intact in SK and the earnest desire of the SK people for the 
unification of an autonomous, democratic Fatherland is not being 
realized," criticized [NK's] President Kim. He also stated, "It 
is right that the SK people and figures from each sector should 
feel that there is no longer anything to watch and hope for from 
the present SK regime." Attention has focused on such statements 
because they reveal NK's overall perception of the Kim Yong-sam 
administration. 
  In short, they contain an underlying "subversiveness" which 
says, "You must struggle without attachment to the civilian 
government," clearly showing a "lack of intention to talk" with 
the other party in the dialogue. 
  If we are to understand why NK has taken a hard-line posture 
this year, we must go back a little in time. 
  Originally, NK focused its attention on NK-Japanese 
negotiations on normalization with the goal of importing 
Japanese capital and technology and on building a system of 
coexistence with SK through a federation-type unification and 
economic cooperation. To accomplish this, it accepted IAEA 
nuclear inspections and adopted the North-South Basic Agreement 
and Joint Declaration on Denuclearization. However, NK's plans 
were not realized because of the U.S.'s hard-line position 
concerning the nuclear issue. U.S. pressure grew and it became 
clear that the U.S. was strongly influencing Japan and SK. As a 
result, Japan, keeping in step with the U.S., made it clear that 
there would be no progress in normalization negotiations as long 
as the NK nuclear issue was unresolved. Ignoring the NK position 
of strongly demanding, as an indication of our intention to 
implement the Basic Agreement, "the abandonment of the system of 
international cooperation" and "the discontinuance of various 
war exercises," our government responded by strengthening 
cooperation with the U.S. and other allies and using Team Spirit 
exercises as a means for pressuring NK to resolve the nuclear 
issue. 
  In this process, NK appears to have understood that its 
normalization negotiations with the Japanese Government were not 
going smoothly and that, on top of this, the Kim Yong-sam 
administration's posture toward the North was not that 
transitional compared with past governments and was 
"nonautonomous" to the extent that it considered international 
pressure on NK important, and that its gradual trend toward 
conservatism was becoming stronger. 
  Thus, NK put off NK-Japanese normalization negotiations and 
the North-South dialogue. Rather, by playing its nuclear card, 
it attempted to find a breakthrough in the direction of direct 
negotiations with the U.S. This was the mood last year. Now, the 
situation has changed. NK's nuclear card has won a certain 
measure of success. As the battle surrounding the NK nuclear 
issue continues, the scene has taken on a new composition: the 
North-South dialogue has moved to the back and direct NK-U.S. 
negotiations have begun in earnest. These are the main factors 
preventing NK from being active in its dialogue with the Kim 
Yong-sam administration. 
  NK appears to have concluded that, in view of the 
conservative current of the Kim Yong-sam administration as is 
seen in the continued existence of the National Security Law and 
the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Han Wan-song, it has 
nothing to gain through the inter-Korean dialogue. Another 
aspect of this appears to be that NK seems to have been 
encouraged by reports that activists in SK are again gaining 
vigor over the opening of the SK rice market and that there is 
movement to organize a new unification movement. It is because 
of this that statements have been frequently flowing out of NK 
reports that the struggle against opening the SK rice market 
must be sublimated into an "autonomy, democracy, and unification 
movement." 
  Considering the fact that existing policy, that "the 
inter-Korean exchange of special envoys must be realized before 
the third round of NK-U.S. talks," was confirmed by a decision 
reached in government unification-related, high-level strategy 
meetings, the U.S. choice now remains important. This is because 
it appears that NK clearly has no intention of exchanging envoys. 
  [NK] President Kim's New Year's address confirms this. 
"Pressure and threats do not work with us. Not only is it 
impossible to solve the problem depending on such methods, but 
they could push the situation into a catastrophe," he said. "The 
U.S. must look at all the facts correctly and act prudently." 
Even while taking this hard-line stance, he stated that the 
nuclear issue could be resolved "if, on condition of a joint 
declaration between NK and the U.S., both sides keep and perform 
the principles already agreed upon." This can be viewed as an 
expression of his intention to continue to resolve the issue 
through dialogue. A result of the first round of NK-U.S. talks 
last June, the "joint declaration" mentioned here contains: 
suspension of threats and the use of force, including nuclear 
weapons; respect for each other's sovereignty and 
noninterference in internal politics; and support for a peaceful 
unification of the Korean peninsula. For NK, this result in 
considerable concessions by the U.S. was gained by playing its 
nuclear card. Thus, NK has evaluated this joint declaration as 
having "put an end to the hostile relationship between NK and 
the U.S. and prepared a common foundation capable of 
fundamentally resolving the nuclear issue." 
  At this stage, an important clue for anticipating future 
progress is the content of a news conference with the Korean 
Central News Agency given by a NK foreign ministry spokesperson 
the day after the 18th contact (on December 29th), which took 
place after July's second round of talks in Geneva. "In this 
contact, the U.S. side formally expressed its intention to 
suspend Team Spirit joint military exercises as a part of its 
measures to eliminate the nuclear threat toward us. As befits 
our special status of having temporarily suspended the 
validation of our withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty [NPT], we decided to permit inspections needed to 
guarantee the continuity of compliance, not regular or irregular 
inspections legally required in accordance with the treaty on 
nuclear facilities, which we have already reported," he 
revealed. Thus, the U.S. ultimately promised to suspend Team 
Spirit exercises without being able to make NK return to the 
situation as it was before it announced it would withdraw from 
the NPT. This means that the SK-U.S. plan to use Team Spirit 
exercises as a means for pressuring NK ended in failure. 
  "Based on this progress, we have decided to conclude a 
package settlement of the issues in the third round of talks, to 
fundamentally solve the nuclear issue by ending the U.S.'s 
nuclear threat and hostile policy toward us, by improving 
NK-U.S. relations, and by resuming regular and irregular IAEA 
inspections of our nuclear facilities," the Foreign Ministry 
spokesperson confirmed. This means that the U.S. is accepting 
the "package settlement" upon which NK has stubbornly insisted. 
  If this package settlement is achieved in the third round of 
talks, there is a high probability that the IAEA special 
inspections and the North-South mutual inspections (and an 
exchange of special envoys in preparation for this), 
persistently sought by the U.S., will be put off. Now the U.S. 
is left with a serious choice. As a story which was leaked out 
in early January, it is unknown whether there was an agreement 
between NK and the U.S. on "reopening the North-South dialogue." 
Officially, the NK position is, "The North-South dialogue is an 
issue internal to the Korean people. Therefore, it is not 
something for the U.S. to interfere in." The U.S. State 
Department insists that NK expressed its intention to "reopen 
the North-South dialogue." Even while impatient to gain, if 
nothing else, at least IAEA inspections of NK, in order to 
maintain the NPT system, the U.S. seems to be trying hard not to 
give this impression to the SK side. 
  On the one hand, there is a possibility that, following the 
current of improvement in NK-U.S. relations, NK-Japanese 
relations will escape from last year's stagnation and make 
progress at considerable speed. Reports have already come out 
that the Japanese Government is secretly pursuing a resumption 
of talks on normalizing relations with NK. If NK and the U.S. 
successfully conclude a "package settlement," prospects for 
NK-Japanese normalization will become that much brighter. Also, 
even if a "package settlement" is delayed, the mood of 
negotiations on normalization will change considerably. However, 
although normalized relations with the U.S. are remote, it is 
still unknown whether normalized relations with Japan will be 
achieved this year. This is because negotiations will proceed 
even in a state in which the NK "nuclear question" has not 
completely disappeared. In connection with this, it is being 
reported by some that our government is taking pains to come up 
with countermeasures out of concern that a normalization of NK 
relations with the U.S. and Japan might suddenly be achieved. 
What is more, although difficult to believe, it has even been 
reported that the government is planning to help NK normalize 
relations with the U.S. and Japan. Regardless, it appears that 
the shock of NK normalization with the U.S. and Japan will bring 
a change of perception greater than when SK normalized relations 
with China and the Soviet Union and that its effects will be 
considerable. 
  On the other hand, the U.S. continues to demand a "complete 
resolution of the NK nuclear question," special inspections by 
the IAEA and North-South mutual inspections. NK continues to 
reject this and there is a good possibility it may end up 
withdrawing its suspension of the validity of its withdrawal 
from the NPT. If this happens, the NK nuclear issue will 
ultimately be set before the UN Security Council. In such an 
event, NK would withdraw from the UN "without hesitating." 
Although it is questionable whether a decision will be made in 
the UN to take even economic sanctions, in the unlikely event 
that this does happen, military tensions on the Korean peninsula 
will rapidly increase. Thus, it appears that it will be 
difficult for the U.S. to continue with its existing position, 
calling for a "complete resolution of the NK nuclear question." 
  However, if the U.S. demands no more than normal inspections 
(giving up on special inspections of two locations), it will 
mean relinquishing a complete resolution of the NK nuclear 
question. This would damage the authority of the IAEA and the UN 
and would give rise to the insecurity of the NPT system. Here is 
the dilemma of the U.S. There is a strong possibility that after 
first achieving full-scale implementation of normal inspections, 
the U.S. will try to see through long-term, staged demands to 
secure nuclear transparency. This process will be an extension 
of NK-U.S. talks. 
  However, even though the nuclear question remains, if the 
international mood goes in the direction of believing that the 
NK nuclear issue has been settled, Japan will consider 
normalization with NK, although it may take some time. In 
connection with this, the December appointment of party 
secretary Hwang Chang-yop as chairman of the Supreme People's 
Assembly's Foreign Relations Committee suggests much. It is 
anticipated that in the future he will play an important role in 
foreign relations with Japan, the U.S. and other Western nations. 
  This year, NK is negative toward the inter-Korean dialogue, 
but it is predicted that it will show comparatively great 
interest in the expansion of the National Unification Front. 
This is clearly seen in the New Year's address also. 
  Setting out as a fundamental principle a federation-style 
unification based on his National-Solidarity 10-Point Program 
and the idea of one people, one nation, two systems, two 
governments, [NK] President Kim urged, "By banding together as 
one under the standard of national solidarity and carrying out a 
nationwide struggle, this year all Korean people in the North, 
South and overseas, must open a new phase of the unification of 
the Fatherland." This is an expression of his intention to 
concentrate all his powers on expanding the National Unification 
Front. 
  This is not a National Unification Front aimed solely at 
activists in SK or overseas. It means that he is going to 
promote cooperation with various civilian figures, including 
those in business and religion, and responsible leaders of 
political parties and social organizations. This unification 
policy, referred to as the expansion of the National Unification 
Front, is first of all focused on isolating the Kim Yong-sam 
administration. The next stage comes out of an intention to give 
the Kim Yong-sam administration no choice, through the use of 
internal and external pressure, but to adopt a "transitional 
posture toward the North." The core of his unification line is 
contained in the 10-Point Program, which came out last April, 
and it appears that in the future no NK unification policy will 
depart from this framework. The 10-Point Program is an extension 
of 1973's Fatherland Unification 5-Point Program, 1980's 
Federation 10-Point Revised Plan, and 1990's Fatherland 
Unification 5-Point Plan. Even so, it can be said to be a new 
action directive, newly prepared in consideration of the new 
international environment. 
  The 10-Point Program supposes a "unified nation which is 
autonomous, peaceful, and neutral" (Item 1). This unified nation 
would leave intact the existing two systems and two governments. 
It would be a federal state in which the regional governments 
would participate equally. The ideological foundation of 
national solidarity is love for the Korean people and a spirit 
of national autonomy (Item 2). Its fundamental principle is to 
make everything subordinate to the promotion of coexistence, 
coprosperity, and the public interest, and to the great work of 
unification (Item 3). 
  Presented as actual, immediate tasks are: suspension of all 
political strife, which promotes division and confrontation 
(Item 4); elimination of apprehensions about invasion from the 
North and South, about victory over communism or communization 
(Item 5); regard for the importance of democracy and 
acknowledgment of differences in ideology and doctrine (Item 6); 
protection of material and mental wealth owned by individuals 
and organizations (Item 7); and understanding and trust through 
contact, exchange and dialogue. Besides these, it adds that the 
subject of national solidarity is the whole Korean people in the 
North, South, and overseas (Item 9) and that people who have 
contributed to national solidarity and unification need to be 
valued highly (Item 10). 
  Here, items three, seven, and ten are interesting in that 
they also aim for economic cooperation with SK businessmen. In 
light of the 10-Point Program, even if NK does not consider 
inter-Korean talks important this year, it will continue to be 
interested in North-South economic exchange through a third 
country, which is in the middle of active development, and in 
direct exchange. In this process, discord may appear between our 
government, which wants overall control of economic cooperation 
with the North in keeping with its principle of "window 
unification," and business. 
  NK's interest in the National Unification Front was also 
confirmed in the All-Korea Alliance [Pomminnyon] Platform (seven 
items) and Regulations (Chapter 5 Article 23), published 
December 16th of last year in a news conference by Paek In-chun, 
chairman of the All-Korea Alliance's northern headquarters. The 
platform is an overall reorganization of what had been argued in 
the resolutions of the All-Korea Conference [Pomminjok Taehoe] 
and the Council of Joint Chairmen. 
  Overall, the inter-Korean dialogue has come to a standstill 
this year. As the movement of surrounding nations centered on NK 
speeds up, it is possible that discord within SK will grow over 
evaluations of the NK attitude and responses to it. There could 
even be subtle dissonance exposed between SK and the U.S., 
depending on the situation. This may even become the year that 
the "breaking of the system of international cooperation," 
persistently pursued by NK, is successful. If the situation 
develops in this way, the government may have no choice but to 
relax its hard-line posture toward the North. NK's hard-line 
posture toward the South can be viewed as having had this as its 
aim. NK's brushing aside our government to depend tenaciously on 
direct negotiations with the U.S. is a result of its conclusion 
that the North-South dialogue has no meaning under conditions in 
which the Basic Agreement is not being kept. Also, behind NK's 
concentration of its efforts on expanding the National 
Unification Front is its intention to isolate the Kim Yong-sam 
administration. 
  If the government is to take a leading role in the 
resumption 
of the North-South dialogue, then it seems that it would be good 
for it to actively enter into arms-reduction negotiations, for 
the "construction of a peaceful system" capable of being a 
fundamental solution to the nuclear problem. This is because 
arms-reduction negotiations are desired by NK as well. At the 
same time, North-South economic cooperation could be implemented 
in parallel. Otherwise, we could be dragged around by the 
situation produced by NK, which is simultaneously taking a 
hard-line posture toward SK and a relaxed posture toward the 
U.S. A "nationally autonomous," transitional attitude is a 
prerequisite if the government is to actively enter 
arms-reduction negotiations. For the present, this appears to be 
a very difficult choice.

  [Text] Seoul, March 30 (YONHAP) -- Democratic Party 
chairman Yi Ki-taek on Wednesday refuted a recent North Korean 
statement expressing hope that he would soon visit Pyongyang, 
indicating he has no such plans at this juncture. 
  "They (North Koreans) might have something to give me, but 
they needn't tell me to do this or that," he said. 
  A close associate said Yi thinks it undesirable to visit 
North Korea when the nuclear issue remains so touchy. "But there 
is no change in his plans to visit North Korea to help establish 
smooth inter-Korean relations when an opportune time comes 
along," the associate added. 
  On Tuesday, an unidentified spokesman for North Korea's 
Supreme People's Assembly (parliament) issued a statement saying 
the speaker's invitation for Yi to visit Pyongyang is still open. 
  The ruling Democratic Liberal Party also criticized the 
North 
Korean statement for its hidden motive to create confusion in 
South Korean politics.

Bank of Korea announced Tuesday. 
  The money units are the Chinese Yuan, the Indonesian Rupiah, 
the Thai Baht and the ECU (European Currency Unit) of the 
European Union. 
  Beginning April 11, local banks will provide money exchange 
services for these currencies. 
  China, Indonesia and Thailand are among Korea's 20 largest 
trading partners and more Korean tourists are visiting these 
countries, increasing the need to change the Won into their 
legal tenders, the announcement said. 
  The need for an ECU exchange is also rising as the European 
Union transforms into a single monetary area, it added. 
  The number of currencies whose exchange values against the 
Won are included in the daily foreign exchange rates posted by 
the Korea financial telecommunication and clearings institute 
will increase from the current 25 to 29. 
  The 25 present currencies are the U.S. dollar, the Japanese 
Yen, the British Pound sterling, the German Mark, the Australian 
Dollar, the French Franc, the Italian Lira, the Canadian Dollar, 
the Swiss Franc, the Hong Kong Dollar, the Swedish Krona, the

  [Text] With the approaching National Assembly approval of 
the plan to implement the Uruguay Round [UR], including the 
opening of the rice market, college students are planning 
large-scale demonstrations, and the police have gone on 
emergency alert. 
  Colleges in the Pusan area, including Pusan and Tong-a 
Universities, will conduct a student referendum beginning today 
[29 March] on the adoption of the 12 April Morocco Treaty in 
connection with the UR negotiations and on the National Assembly 
approval of UR implementation. The students will continue a 
petition drive on the streets and distribute printed material 
following an assessment meeting at Puyong Theater at 5 PM on 30 
March. 
  The Korea Federation of University Student Councils 
[Hanchongnyon] will hold a deputy election from 1 to 3 April at 
Pusan University, which will be attended by 15,000 students from 
throughout the country. They will adopt a policy to go on 
strike on 8 and 9 April in opposition to the National Assembly's 
approval of the UR. 
  A considerable controversy is expected concerning the 
National Assembly's approval of the UR implementation plan 
because Hanchongnyon and colleges in the Pusan area are planning 
a struggle against the opening of the rice market in May in 
alliance with labor unions after obtaining support from farmers 
to oppose the rice market opening during their rural activities, 
which begin in April.

  [Text] Seoul, March 25 (YONHAP) -- The Hyundai Business

  Hyundai Corp., Hyundai Electronics Ind. Co., Ltd. and Dacom

communications services, will put 48 satellites into orbit about 
1, 400 kilometers above the earth. 
  The three South Korean companies have formed a consortium

will cost 1.8 billion dollars and be capitalized at 275 million 
dollars. 
  The Hyundai Group will invest 80 percent of the South Korean 
consortium's share while Dacom will put up the remaining 20 
percent. 
  The main investors comprise six companies, among them Loral,

  [Text] President Fidel Ramos today said that his meeting 
with top Vietnamese leaders have greatly enhanced 
Philippine-Vietnamese relations, which he describes as a 
critical factor for the solidarity of Southeast Asia and the 
peace and progress of the region. The president said he had 
friendly and powerful meetings with President Le Duc Anh, 
General Secretary Do Muoi of the Communist Party of Vietnam, and 
Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh. The chief executive said he was 
looking forward for his luncheon meeting with the prime 
minister, Vo Van Kiet. 
  President Ramos said Vietnam's leaders are all acutely aware 
of their country's need for regional stability so that they can 
have a breathing spell after two generations of almost 
continuous conflict to set their economy on the road to 
self-sustaining growth. 
  The president said that during his meetings with the 
Vietnamese leaders, he was able to explore new avenues of 
possible cooperation in the South China sea in order to reduce 
tension in the area and promote its joint development as called 
for in the 1992 Manila Declaration on South China Sea. The two 
countries also agreed on the needs to devise confidence-building 
mechanisms or cooperative ventures that will begin to assure 
countries with claims over the area in the rest of the region 
that the South China Sea can transform from waters of contention 
to an area of cooperation. 
  On the repatriation of Vietnamese refugees still in the 
Philippines, the president said, and I [newscaster] quote, We 
agreed that the increasingly favorable economic situation in 
Vietnam should make it easier for our two countries to work out 
the repatriation of the Vietnamese asylum seekers in the 
Philippines, unquote. 
  President Ramos paid tribute to Vietnam's revolutionary 
leader Ho Chi Minh by laying a wreath at his mausoleum at the Ba 
Dinh Square. The president and his official delegation arrived 
at 8:00 A.M. yesterday and briskly walked towards the mausoleum 
escorted by the curator and a guard. After laying the wreath, 
the president proceeded to the Ho Chi Minh residence, located 
inside the compound of the Presidential Palace. The two-room 
house is made of wooden materials. The president accompanied by 
the caretakers stopped by the pond and attempted to fish out but 
failed to catch any. After this, Representative Antonio Cuenco 
told reporters that the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organization 
[AIPO] will invite Vietnam to attend the forthcoming AIPO 
meeting in Manila in September. The invitation will be relayed 
today by the Philippine legislators accompanying President Ramos 
during his official visit in Hanoi. Representative Cuenco said 
that during the AIPO meeting in Manila Vietnam will be offered 
an associate member status, which will make it a dialogue 
partner. Vietnam currently has an observer status in the AIPO. 
  President Ramos visited the assembly plant of Vietnam Motors 
Corp., a joint venture of Filipino and Vietnamese businessmen. 
In extemporaneous remarks during his visit to the plant site, 
the president said the linking up of the two countries in the 
joint economic endeavor is a breakthrough in business 
partnership. He said this partnership is a new arithmetic in 
business in the global economy. The president said that so far 
$7 billion worth of spare parts have been imported from the 
Philippines for the plant, which assembles 9,200 Mazda and [word 
indistinct] vehicles a year. The plant employs a number of 
Filipino managers and technicians. Vietnam Motors Corp. is a 
joint venture between Colombia Motors Group of the Philippines 
and Hoa Binh Automotive factory of Vietnam. Colombia has 70 
percent equity in the firm. The plant started operations in 
1992. 
  President Ramos, recalling that the Philippines and Vietnam 
made solemn commitments to respect each other's territorial and 
sovereign integrity in 1978 and in 1992, last night proposed the 
holding of regular consultations among all states with claims on 
the Spratlys. According to the president, in the South China 
Sea, where both the countries are involved, attention needs to 
be focused not on mutual suspicions but on cooperative ventures 
that build mutual confidence and trust among the claimant 
states. The president said regular consultations on the 
Spratlys can result in greater cooperation in local confidence 
building, marine research, environmental protection and joint 
exploratory activities. 
  According to President Ramos the foundation for the 
friendship between the two countries were laid when they 
established diplomatic relations soon after the reunification of 
Vietnam. The commitments that they made to each other were 
given substance and strength by a joint communique issued in 
1978 by then President Marcos and then Premier Pham Van Dong, 
and they were reaffirmed by Prime minister Vo Van Kiet and 
President Aquino in Manila in 1992. 
  According to President Ramos, and I quote, By this solemn 
undertaking, we pledge peace between us, resolving to settle 
peacefully any disputes and to cooperate for the common good for 
our people. This pledge I reaffirm, Mr. President, on behalf of 
my government and the Filipino people, unquote. 
  The chief executive said Manila was privileged to be the 
host 
two years ago of Vietnam's accession to the Treaty of Amity and 
Cooperation in Southeast Asia and Vietnam's acceptance as 
observer in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. It was 
during the same occasion in Manila that ASEAN issued the Manila 
Declaration of the South China Sea, which Vietnam immediately 
endorsed. President Ramos noted that his delegation also looked 
intensively into the opportunities for counter trade and 
investments and joint ventures in each other's economy. The 
chief executive also offered the help of the Philippine 
industrialists, academics, managers and technologist in 
rebuilding Vietnam's infrastructure and financial management and 
legislative policy formulation, and in running their tourist 
facilities. 
  According to the president, they also agreed during their 
meeting to collaborate in science and technology, education, and 
public health. The two countries also agreed to exert every 
effort to raise the level of trade and to take every advantage 
of complimentarity, adding that the trade protocol signed 
yesterday identified a long list of products that could 
profitably be exchanged between the two countries. According to 
President Ramos and I quote, We proposed and they agreed that we 
establish a joint commission to deal comprehensively with the 
whole range of our relationship and nurture its steady 
expansion, unquote. To promote tourism in both countries, 
President Ramos cited the just concluded tourism and cultural 
agreement between the Philippines and the Vietnamese officials.

<F P=106> [By Cristina D. C. Pastor] </F>
  [Text] The Senate yesterday paved the way for an easier 
entry of investments from multilateral financial institutions 
(MFIs) and projects from neighbors in the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations after it approved an amendment to the 
Omnibus Investment Code that will lift the nationality 
requirement provision. 
  The amendment will require the Board of Investments (BoI) to 
recommend to the president the lifting of the restriction which 
was, under the existing law, only an option that could be taken 
by the investment regulating agency. 
  In a statement, Senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, chairperson 
of the committee on economic affairs, said the nationality 
requirement could be suspended in preferred investment areas 
where BoI- registered MFIs could come in like manufacturing and 
processing of textiles, petrochemicals, and ventures needed for 
industrialization. 
  The amendment said the suspension, which covered ASEAN 
projects, investments of ASEAN nationals or MFIs, or other 
international complementation schemes for particular products 
will allow the country "... to take advantage of economies of 
scale" from among ASEAN neighbors. 
  A statement from the Senate press office said the mandatory 
lifting of the nationality requirement would benefit MFIs like 
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the United Nations 
Development Programme, which have signified interest in 
investing in the country's development and industrialization. 
Based on the ADB Quarterly Review, ADB made direct equity 
investments last year of $23 million compared with $10.6 million 
in 1992. 
  MFI activities in the country have so far been limited to 
providing financing to government and the private sector for 
development projects. 
  The Senate measure will liberalize the MFIs' operations to 
allow them to participate in specific undertakings. 
  The Senate will also approve today the bill allowing at 
least 
six new foreign banks in the country to establish branches, 
subsidiaries, or buy up to 60 percent equity into existing 
Philippine banks. 
  Senator Raul Roco said the bill, once enacted into law, will 
have the effect of dispersing control within the banking 
industry. He said five big banks dominate the sector by 
controlling more than 50 percent of deposits, while existing 
foreign banks control only 8 percent. 
  "In 1981, when the top five Filipino banks controlled 30 
percent of deposits, the profit spread was 1.8 percent. After 
13 years today, the top five now hold up to 52 percent control 
and their profit spread has risen to 7.3 percent," he said. In 
Senate Bill 1606, the number of foreign banks may increase to 
eight on approval of the president, said Mr. Roco, chairman of 
the Committee on Banks, Financial Institutions, and Currencies. 
  A foreign bank will be allowed to establish up to six 
branches. For the first three branches, there is a "permanently 
assigned capital" of P250 million [Philippine pesos] converted 
in dollars for one major branch, and another P100 million for 
two additional branches. 
  The bill says foreign banks may enter the country through a 
60 percent owned subsidiary or by acquiring 60 percent of an 
existing Philippine bank. 
  The bill, Mr. Roco stressed, has a provision on "equal 
treatment," which states that "any right, privilege or incentive 
enjoyed by foreign banks shall also be extended to the 
Philippine banks." It also allows any listed company to buy 
into any Philippine bank, he said. 
  Also yesterday, the Senate was scheduled to ratify the bill 
proposing amendments to the build-operate-transfer (BOT) law. 
  Senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo said Senate Bill 1586 
amending Republic Act 6957, or the BOT law, will make it easier 
for investors to undertake projects under a "climate of minimum 
regulations." The bicameral panel approved the compromise bill 
yesterday. 
  The Senate yesterday lined up for approval a number of bills 
certified by the president. These bills have to be approved on 
final reading today or tomorrow before Congress goes on its 
Lenten break: 
  -- Senate Bill 1127 or "An act increasing the stocks 
transactions tax amending certain sections of the National 
Internal Revenue Code"; 
  -- Senate Bill 1237 or "An act authorizing immediate 
disconnection of electrical service as sanction for illegal use 
of electricity"; 
  -- Senate Bill 1539 or "An act providing for a six-year 
public works and highways infrastructure program"; and, 
  -- Senate Bill 1630 or "An act restructuring the value-added 
tax system to widen its tax base and enhance its administration."

  [Text] The Philippines has lodged a diplomatic protest 
with Malaysia in connection with the arrest by Malaysian 
authorities of some 1,000 Filipinos in Kuala Lumpur last Sunday. 
This was revealed by Alberto Encomienda, Philippine ambassador 
to Malaysia. 
  According to Encomienda, the arrested Filipinos are working 
in Kuala Lumpur. They were arrested and reportedly imprisoned 
by Malaysian authorities after attending a church service. The 
Filipino workers were arrested when they allegedly failed to 
present documentary evidence showing that their stay in Malaysia 
is legal.

  [Text] Portfolio investments infused into the country by 
non- residents last year went up 298 percent to $2.257 billion 
from the previous year's $566 million. 
  Latest Bangko Sentral [Central Bank] figures furnished 
BUSINESS WORLD also indicate an uptrend in new foreign equity 
infusions last year, which can be attributed primarily to the 
improving investment climate. Fresh foreign equity infusions 
into the country in 1993 climbed 42.7 percent to $334 million, 
from the previous year's level of $234 million. 
  Almost half of the new foreign investments, or $43 million, 
financed projects undertaken via the build-operate-transfer 
(BOT) scheme, the figures showed. 
  Although a positive trend in foreign direct inflows was 
noted, the Philippines continued to pale against some Southeast 
Asian countries. 
  Based on World Bank figures contained in a 1994 report on 
financial flows to Asian countries, the Philippines barely 
accounted for a tenth of net foreign direct investment flows to 
Indonesia in 1992. 
  Save for Thailand, which experienced a slight investment 
drop 
in 1991 but had since posted positive strides, China, Indonesia, 
and Malaysia reported steady investment inflows since 1986. 
  In 1992, foreign investments in China stood at $11.156 
billion; Indonesia, $1.774 billion; Malaysia, $4.117 billion; 
Thailand, $2.115 billion; and the Philippines $228 million. 
  The advocacy group Freedom from Debt Coalition (FDC) said 
foreign direct investments -- and not the net transfers in 
external debt -- are a better indicator of structural 
improvements in the country. 
  "Recent researches in international trends suggest the flow 
of foreign direct investments have increasingly been responsive 
to structural factors such as the availability of an educated 
and highly skilled work force, market size, quality of 
infrastructure, and level of industrialization," it said. 
  Arguing against what Finance Undersecretary Romeo L. 
Bernardo 
earlier heralded as a success in government's efforts to 
maintain the positive trend in the country's external debt 
situation, the FDC said the positive net transfers posted by the 
economy last year was mainly traced to the debt service 
reduction package under the Brady deal and the low interest 
rates then prevailing in the global markets. 
  "The trend can turn out to be the reverse because no 
commensurate increase in direct foreign investments is apparent. 
It is also not clear how this flow of capital can be sustained 
in the medium-term, given that it is initially only a result of 
the recession in the United States and elsewhere," the FDC said.

<F P=106> [By Luis V. Cruz and Rose B. Caparas] </F>
  [Text] Puerto Princesa, Palawan -- After a boom-and-bust 
cycle, which has become the trademark of the country's economic 
performance, government is faced with a critical task of 
sustaining the momentum of the reform process that has scored 
economic gains, NEDA [National Economic and Development 
Authority] Director-General Cielito Habito said during the first 
day of the national consultative workshop of the Philippine 
Futuristics Society. 
  Despite the challenge though, Mr. Habito is confident 
sustainable growth would be achieved. "There are a number of 
factors that underline an optimistic growth scenario for the 
country in the next few years and beyond." 
  He said current economic reforms have provided comfortable 
reasons to expect an enhanced productive capacity. 
  Projections by the National Economic and Development 
Authority estimated investments, as share to real GNP, would 
grow 9.9 percent in 1994. Correspondingly, Mr. Habito said 
construction and manufacturing are expected to improve. 
  Mr. Habito observed this trend was, in fact, manifested 
since 
1993. "The manufacturing sector showed signs of good health and 
is expected to improve further." 
  Construction was likewise noted to have improved. 
  Mr. Habito said during times of economic expansion, 
productive capacity will improve. 
  Exports, as share to gross national product, are also 
expected to grow 11.12 percent by the end of the year and a 
robust 15.7 percent for the 1994-98 period. Growth of imports 
will be slower vis-a-vis exports. For the 1994-1998 period, 
imports are targeted to grow 13.6 percent. 
  In an interview with BUSINESS WORLD, Mr. Habito expressed 
optimism inflation will remain at a single-digit average by the 
end of the year despite the effects of the momentary increase in 
oil prices and increasing labor cost. 
  Meanwhile, with the outward oriented economic reforms put in 
place, Mr. Habito said the economy is in a much better position 
to weather both internal and external shocks. 
  Towards the year 2000, the rapid growth within the 
Asia-Pacific region and its participation in the AFTA [ASEAN 
Free Trade Area] is expected to propel the country to a higher 
growth path. The country's industries are thus expected to gain 
world competitiveness.

  [Text] Former Ambassador Manuel T. Yan disclosed yesterday 
that representatives of the Moro National Liberation Front 
(MNLF) and the government panel have agreed to hold the second 
round of formal talks on 13-20 April in Jakarta, Indonesia. 
  Yan, chairman of the government panel in the peace 
negotiations with the MNLF said that another meeting among 
members of the mixed committee representing both panels was also 
slated for 5-7 April in Zamboanga City in preparation for the 
holding of the formal talks in Indonesia. 
  He expressed belief that the meeting between the two groups 
will be held smoothly since they have established better 
confidence and atmosphere for the next round of talks. 
  Yan also said that members of the mixed committee of both 
panels met yesterday in an undisclosed place in Metro Manila on 
preparations for the holding of the formal talks. 
  Included in yesterday's meeting were security arrangements 
for members of the two panels, particularly those to be assigned 
to MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari during the 5 April mixed committee 
meeting in Zamboanga City. 
  "We will give him (Misuari) adequate security but definitely 
not more than 500 as he earlier requested," Yan said. 
  A joint cease fire committee chaired by Brig. Gen. Guillermo 
Ruiz of the Philippine Marines will submit today the details of 
the meeting of the mixed committee to Yan. Ruiz's counterpart 
in the secessionist group is an MNLF major general. 
  The joint cease fire committee has formed 13 subcommittees 
in 
the 13 Mindanao provinces to monitor the implementation of the 
cease fire agreement. 
  Yan said that the recently formulated guidelines and ground 
rules for the implementation of the joint cease fire agreement 
signed by the two parties last 7 November in Jakarta "was fully 
endorsed by the Organization of Islamic Countries." 
  Meanwhile, leaders of the MNLF pledged to arrest their 
members who were allegedly involved in the recent kidnaping of 
five school teachers in Basilan. 
  Yan said that the MNLF vowed to arrest Commander Sulaiman 
Alih and a fugitive municipal councilor of Tuburan town in 
Basilan who abducted five teachers of the Boji Tambis Elementary 
School last 7 March. 
  Ruiz said that the kidnaping case presented before the joint 
cease fire committee was considered the first major cease fire 
violation of the MNLF. The five kidnap victims were released 
unharmed last 11 March. 
  Yan, however, stressed that the spate of kidnapings in 
Mindanao has not adversely affected the ongoing peace 
negotiations. 
  President Ramos strengthened yesterday his peace process 
staff as he called on governors and mayors nationwide to fully 
support the ongoing peace negotiations with various rebel groups. 
  The president, stressing that the peace process must move 
on, 
named Manuel Yan acting presidential adviser on the peace 
process, concurrent with his position as chairman of the 
Philippine negotiating panel for the peace talks with the 
Southern Philippine Autonomous Groups (GRP [Government of the 
Republic of the Philippines]-SPAG). 
  Yan, a former ambassador, succeeded Oscar Santos who was 
moved by the president to the post of presidential consultant on 
the peace process. 
  In his regular press conference in Malacanang [presidential 
office], the president said Yan will be responsible for the 
administration of the Office of the Presidential Assistant on 
the Peace Process (OPAPP), as well as supervision of the three 
government negotiating panels. 
  "Santos will now be free to be sent on a mission-type of 
activity to help in the peace process, especially in his area of 
expertise which is among the coconut farmers, small farmers, and 
workers in Quezon and the Southern Tagalog provinces," the 
president said. 
  The president said that Santos has been fighting a serious 
physical disability and has been advised by his doctors to take 
it easy. 
  "But he is okay now," he added. 
  Ramos earlier ordered peace negotiators to speed up their 
work without being blocked by legalities. 
  The president directed all Cabinet Officials for Regional 
Development (CORD) and Regional Development Council (RDC) 
chairpersons to ensure coordinated action and effective 
communication in support of the ongoing peace process of the 
government. 
  During the quarterly CORD-RDC meeting in Malacanang, the 
president emphasized the importance of the involvement of the 
RDC chairmen who are also governors and city mayors of their 
respective areas. 
  "We would like you to get involved in this effort because we 
are seeing the end of the insurgency. We have to make sure that 
we provide some hospitality, opportunity, and attraction for 
those remaining out there in the hills," President Ramos said. 
  The president directed the CORD-RDCs to coordinate closely 
with the OPAPP and the Regional and Provincial Peace Convenors 
in the implementation of measures to support the overall peace 
process of the government. 
  The CORD-RDCs were also directed to inform their 
constituents 
on what the government has done to push the reform program and 
to address the roots of the internal armed conflict in the 
country. 
  The chief executive required them to submit reports on their 
activities in support of the peace process to the Office of the 
President on or before 30 April and thereafter, as may be 
necessary. 
  The role of the RDCs in the comprehensive peace process 
calls 
for pushing the reform process in their own regions and enduring 
genuine people participation in it.

  [Text] The meeting between government and the military 
rebels ended in a stalemate yesterday as both panel stood firm 
in their respective positions on two issues hindering the peace 
talks progress in the peace talks. [sentence as published] 
  The Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [Nationalist 
Revolutionary Alliance]-Soldiers of the Filipino People-Young 
Officers Union (RAM-SFP-YOU) raised the issue of continued 
detention of six soldiers who participated in the series of 
coups against the Aquino administration. 
  The RAM-SFP-YOU also brought up the continued attrition of 
soldiers identified with RAM-SFP-YOU. Navy Capt. Danilo Lim, 
RAM- SFP-YOU spokesperson, said many active soldiers were 
removed from service on the basis of their involvement with the 
reform group. 
  Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina, head of RAM-SFP-YOU panel, said 
the preliminary agreement signed by the two panels in December 
1992 provided for the release of all detainees who participated 
in the military rebellion. But to date, six of the soldiers 
remain behind bars. 
  However, the government panel said the release of six is not 
for the panel to decide but should be left to "judicial 
discretion." 
  Of the six soldiers, two were charged with illegal 
possession 
of firearms and four were detained on orders by trial court 
judges where their respective cases are pending. "The matter of 
continued detention of these soldiers should be left to judicial 
discretion. The government will not interpose any objection 
should bail be applied for," Mr. Alfredo Tadiar, head of the 
government panel, said. 
  On the other issue, Mr. Tadiar said government gave the 
military rebels last week its policy on attrition for study and 
evaluation. 
  The RAM-SFP-YOU said the policy on attrition failed to cover 
all soldiers affected. "Ang attrition policy na pinalabas ng 
Armed Forces ay hindi na-cover ang iba pa naming kasamahan na 
apektado ng attrition. Ang hinihiling namin ay i-apply ito 
equally sa lahat ng aming kasamahan [The attrition policy issued 
by the Armed Forces does not cover other members affected by 
attrition. What we demand is that this should be applied 
equally to all our members]," Mr. Abenina said. 
  The attrition policy was prepared by Armed Forces of the 
Philippines Chief of Staff Gen. Lisandro Abadia and studied by 
National Defense Secretary Renato de Villa before it was signed 
by President Ramos. 
  "Ang implication nito [The implication of this is that], 
because it has already been signed by the President, hindi na 
maiibalik ang mga kasama namin na natanggal sa tungkulin [our 
members dismissed from duty will not be reinstated]," Mr. Lim 
said. 
  The RAM-SFP-YOU voiced discontent over the explanations 
given 
by the government panel but reiterated earlier statements that 
they will not pull out from talks. 
  Despite heated arguments on various differences in opinion, 
the head of the government panel remained optimistic. "We have 
promised each other that we will not give up the peace process," 
Mr. Tadiar said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Transparency Vital in Any Repatriation"] </F>
  [Text] The protest by the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR) over the Thai Government's "voluntary" 
repatriation of some 25,000 Cambodian refugees back to their 
homeland last week has focussed the attention of the 
international community on the human rights issue involved. In 
a letter to Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, UN High 
Commissioner Sadako Ogata said she was saddened by the event. 
She also took "strong exception" to the "manner" in which the 
repatriation was carried out by the Thai Government. 
  Except for a number of Thai military officers who actually 
supervised the repatriation, no outsiders -- not even UNHCR 
representatives or members of the mass media -- were allowed to 
witness the event. In fact, the UNHCR had requested access to 
the displaced people, but this was rejected by the Thai 
Government. According to an explanation offered by National 
Security Council secretary-general Kachatphai Burutphat, the 
situation at the time was confused and permission was, 
therefore, not granted. 
  Because the repatriation was done in such a clandestine 
manner,it was natural for the UNHCR to harbour suspicions that 
the Cambodian refugees might be forced back into Cambodia and 
that their lives might be at great risk due to the continuing 
fighting. Besides, there had been previous instances -- which 
were well-documented -- of forced repatriation of Cambodian 
refugees into dangerous areas. 
  Had access been granted in the first place to UNHCR 
representatives or the push-back been carried out in a 
transparent manner, a protest would have been avoided and the 
country's image and reputation would not have been affected. 
And the trip organised by the Supreme Command for Bangkok-based 
reporters to monitor the situation in the Chanthaburi border 
area would have been unnecessary. It is unlikely to help much 
in eliminating the mistrust of the international community, 
anyway. 
  Of course, the Thai Government's foremost responsibility is 
towards protecting national interests. The Government has every 
right to repatriate the Cambodian refugees or even to deny them 
entry if it felt their presence would jeopardise national 
interests. But since we are not alone in this world and are part 
of the international community, we have to recognise and accept 
some of the universal principles laid down by the world 
community, such as human rights. The Government was right and 
should be commended for opening the border to receive the asylum 
seekers from Cambodia. It is unfortunate that the Government 
then chose to hide from the public eye when it decided to send 
the refugees home. 
  But to view the Thai Government's action in a negative light 
without taking a serious look at the root cause of the refugee 
problem is very unfair to Thailand. The Cambodian Government's 
accusation that Thailand violated human rights by driving 
Cambodian refugees back into their home country sounds 
hypocritical because it has to take the full blame for starting 
a war which sent its people fleeing in panic across the border. 
All the warring factions in Cambodia must share the blame for 
their stubbornness and selfishness which resulted in their 
inability to reconcile among themselves. 
  The United Nations must also be held responsible for its 
ineffectiveness and complete failure to disarm the Khmer Rouge 
guerrillas as well as their rival factions, leaving behind an 
unaccomplished task and a country which is still very much at 
war, much like the day the first UN peacekeeping troops marched 
triumphantly into Cambodia to restore peace and supervise 
general elections. 
  If the Government feels it has fulfilled its humanitarian 
responsibility and considers it to be safe enough for the 
Cambodian refugees to go home without risking their lives, there 
is no reason to hide from the public the manner in which it 
carried out the repatriation or will carry out any similar 
operations in the future.

  [Text] Chanthaburi-Trat Task Force deputy commander Thirat 
Chomanan yesterday rejected criticism by the UNHCR over 
Thailand's repatriation of some 25,000 Cambodians who sought 
refuge from fighting in their country. 
  He said none of the refugees had been forced home against 
their will. 
  The deputy commander said the refugees had been moved to a 
site in Ban Saptali after their representatives asked the task 
force not to push them into returning from where they had come. 
  "We had to relocate them to a safe area for humanitarian 
reasons," he told some 40 reporters on a tour of Ban Phakkat and 
Ban Saptali organised by the Supreme Command headquarters. 
  "It would have been forceful repatriation if we pushed them 
back in the same direction from where they had come." 
  About 25,000 Cambodians took refuge along the border near 
Ban 
Phakkat in Pong Namron District when Phnom Penh forces seized 
the Khmer Rouge stronghold of Pailin last week. 
  Rear Admiral Thirat said the refugees had all been 
repatriated last Saturday after he received an order from the 
Government to push them back to Cambodia. 
  He said the task force commander Vice Admiral Manat 
Pinkunabut, met with representatives of the refugees last Friday 
where he was asked to repatriate them to a safe area within at 
least 10 kilometres of Ban Phakkat. 
  The deputy commander said Ban Saptali about 20 kilometres 
north of Ban Phakkat had been selected as the repatriation site 
as about 400 Cambodians lived in the area. 
  The Cambodians had volunteered to be relocated to Ban 
Saptali. 
  He said the allegation that authorities had been guilty of 
inhuman acts while conducting the repatriation was unfounded. 
  "We did not force them to Ban Saptali. They volunteered to 
go there. It is the safest site. This is not inhumanity." 
  Rear Admiral Thirat said local authorities had to provide 
aid 
to refugees for humanitarian reasons which "does not mean we are 
supporting either side."

  [Text] The foreign minister dismissed a report about the 
UNHCR protesting to Thailand about the repatriation of Cambodian 
refugees to the zone controlled by the Khmer Rouge. Squadron 
Leader Prasong Sunsiri said the note sent by the UNHCR thanked 
Thailand for temporarily granting the refugees shelter during 
fighting in Cambodia. 
  [Begin recording] [Prasong, in progress] ... I cannot figure 
out. When he was here, Prince Sirivut did not say a thing to me 
concerning that. I explained to him our policy -- we have no 
centers for the refugees; we allow them here for a short period 
of time and they must return when there is calm. The UNHCR 
should consult with the Cambodian Government and arrange things 
together. There is a large area in Cambodia. If they plan an 
offensive, they should prepare a site to which their people 
could be moved. [End recording] 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan said that the action 
taken by Thailand was not an abuse nor did it contradict 
international norms. Thailand provided shelter for refugees who 
crossed into the country and sent them back when the situation 
improved. Those people were sent back on a voluntary basis. 
  The spokesman of the Prime Minister's Office added that the 
foreign minister had reported to the cabinet about the 
repatriation of refugees and said it was carried out under 
government policy. The refugees were sent to a safe area on a 
voluntary basis. He also noted that he already made everything 
clear to the Cambodian foreign minister. As for a report about 
the United Nations expressing concern about the issue, he said 
he had made a clarification to the United Nations and offered to 
provide facilities to it if it wishes to be here to take care of 
the refugees. 
  Commenting on this subject, Defense Minister General Wichit 
Sukmak said that Thailand generally is praised for its help for 
the distressed. Thailand upholds its commitment to the UN 
principles. He said the United Nations should take the refugees 
with it if it wants to protest against Thailand.

  [Text] The Phnom Penh Government and Khmer Rouge troops 
were engaged in heavy battles for the control of Cambodia's 
Pailin township several days ago. Consequently, over 25,000 
Cambodians fled the fighting to take safe refuge at Phakkat 
Village in the border district of Pong Nam Ron of Chanthaburi 
Province. For humanitarian reasons, Thailand had to allow these 
refugees to stay on its soil on a temporary basis, which was a 
truely praiseworthy act. The Thai Government has clearly 
announced worldwide that Thailand has no policy of taking any 
more refugees, following the recent permanent closure of all 
refugee camps in the country. 
  An interesting point to note regarding the influx of the 
Cambodian refugees is the proposal put forth by the National 
Security Council [NSC] for the setting up of safe areas inside 
Cambodian territory. The NSC said that the situation after the 
formation of the Cambodian Government has been relatively safe 
for the setting up of a haven accessible to the UNHCR officials 
to provide direct assistance to war victims. 
  The reasons cited by the NSC in making such a proposal are 
compatible with the Thai Government's intention not to allow 
Cambodians to take refuge in Thailand following the closure of 
the refugee camps. The past policy of the government in 
providing shelter to the war-displaced Cambodians was made, 
besides for humanitarian reasons, on the grounds that Cambodia 
in those days was under the control of warring factions, none of 
which were recognized by the world community. But now Cambodia 
is now ruled by the national government, the latter must be 
responsible for the safety and well-being of the Cambodian 
people. 
  We fully support such a clear-cut policy of the Thai 
Government and NSC. We must tell the world that things have 
changed. The UNHCR and other countries have the right to ask 
Thailand to reopen the refugee camps. However, Thailand has the 
right to reject their request because we also have to work on 
our own problems. 
  Thailand's philanthropic activities in connection with the 
Cambodian refugees have been praised by some countries. But, at 
the same time, many other countries criticized the way Thailand 
handled the refugee problem in spite of the fact Thailand gained 
nothing from keeping the refugees in the country. This is an 
important issue that requires careful and thorough 
consideration. It is recommended that Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai issue a statement to tell the world that Thailand is not 
obligated to walk along the path drawn by the UNHCR.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Humanitarianism and Conditions"] </F>
  [Text] On Saturday Thailand was criticized by Cambodian 
Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut after having pushed back 
some 20,000 Cambodian refugees from Pong Nam Ron District, 
Chanthaburi Province. The Cambodian foreign minister said the 
push back was an inhuman act because it amounted to sending 
these people to their deaths or to face starvation. 
  In the middle of last week some 30,000 Cambodian civilians 
fled the violent fighting between the Khmer Rouge, who were 
defending their base in Pailin, and the attacking government 
forces across the border. The government forces succeeded in 
capturing Pailin. 
  The Cambodian foreign minister's timely use of the 
opportunity to criticize Thailand for pushing back the refugees 
has damaged Thailand's image. The world could probably also 
envisage some victimization of the Cambodian refugees. 
  On humanitarian grounds, the fleeing Cambodians should 
receive protection and appropriate humanitarian assistance from 
the neighboring country. 
  It is true that the Thai Government has made public its 
policy of not reopening any refugee camp after the peace accord 
was reached in Paris in October 1991. The UN supervised 
election in Cambodia in May 1993 was followed by the 
repatriation of the last batch of Cambodians from Thailand. 
  The Thai policy of not reopening a refugee camp and its 
appeal to the United Nations to establish a safety zone inside 
Cambodia to assist the Cambodians are sound in principle. 
However, it is inappropriate to use the plight of the 
Cambodians as a bargaining tool when it results in the violation 
of human rights and humanitarian principles. 
  At least, the Thai Government cannot deny that hundreds of 
thousands of Burmese still remain in Thailand after the Burmese 
Army suppression of Burmese politicians and students, which 
started in 1988. Why then used harsh measures against the 
Cambodians? 
  Is it not this government which implemented the policy of 
lenient passport and visa checks to facilitate the entry of 
foreign visitors, the policy which enables international 
terrorists to sneak into the country? But the same government 
has sent back Cambodian civilians less than a week after they 
fled the war to Thailand. The government should consider the 
reaction of the world from the humanitarian and human rights 
angles.

more about democracy. 
  [Begin recording] [Chuan] It is better for us to discuss 
democracy, not coups. We can solve problems through the

  [Unidentified correspondent] Is it time for us to solve

  [Chuan] I have stressed all the time that we should deal 
with problems in line with rules and regulations under the 
democratic system. I hate threats because people have dignity. 
[end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Defense Minister General Wichit Sukmak said that 
it is just an academic paper about a coup, how it is staged, and 
whether or not it will benefit the country. This has nothing to 
do with countering government policy. 
  [Begin recording] [Wichit] It is an expression of opinion by 
the writer. This is just a theory. It has no harm. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Will it cause confusion since 
the article is publicized in the army newsletter? 
  [Wichit] It depends on interpretation. I have not read the 
article. Thank you for informing me about this. I believe that 
it is rather an academic article. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Have there been any moves in 
the Armed Forces? 
  [Wichit] The military leaders have repeated on several 
occasions that the Armed Forces are an apparatus of the 
government. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Do you think that such an 
article was meant as a hint at a time when there is political 
confusion? 
  [Wichit] It is rather an academic article. [end recording]

  [Text] The Bank of Thailand revised its estimate of 
domestic economic growth for this year from 7.9 per cent to 8 
per cent, a slight increase driven by an acceleration of the 
economy over the last two months of 1993 and the first quarter 
of this year. 
  It also revised Thailand's economic growth tally for 1993 
upwards, from 7.5 per cent to 7.8 per cent. This revision was 
based on data provided by the National Economic and Social 
Development Board. 
  Economic acceleration in the last two months of 1993 had led 
the central bank's economists to miscalculate the growth figure 
by 0.1 percentage point. 
  Following extensive discussions with the central bank, 
International Monetary Fund officials expressed confidence that 
the Thai economy has a strong potential to grow robustly for a 
long time yet. 
  In the medium term (over the next three to five years), 
economic growth is expected to remain between seven and eight 
per cent. Current account deficits will be capped at five per 
cent of the gross domestic product before the end of the 7th 
National Economic and Social Development Plan in 1996. 
  "It is this year that the central bank will be actively 
intervening in the money market. We have gradually loosened our 
monetary policy since the middle of last year. We'll be taking 
a cautious stance now to keep inflation, imports and current 
account deficits under control," said Dr. Chaiyawat Phibunsawat, 
the Assistant Governor of the central bank. "This will help 
stabilize economic expansion in the medium term and over the 
long haul." 
  The bank's preliminary report of the IMF, however, shows its 
concern over supplies and the country's ability to manufacture 
enough to meet its domestic demand. Most industries have revved 
up their production to full capacity already and skilled labor 
is scarce. While the global economic recovery is expected to 
lead to higher consumption and investment levels, it might also 
trigger overspending. With inadequate supplies of materials for 
industry, inflationary pressure here will heighten, imports will 
surge and the current account deficit will widen. 
  "These three indices are of particular concern this year, 
more so than last year. The IMF suggested that spending must be 
kept at an appropriate level, checked by fiscal discipline," 
Chaiyawat said. The government has recorded a fiscal surplus for 
seven consecutive years now and is likely to set a balanced 
budget for fiscal 1995 as well. In fiscal 1994, the government 
agreed to run a deficit to stimulate demand in the provinces. 
  Although the central bank has been trying to keep credit and 
money supply growth at an appropriate level, it will face an 
increasingly uphill task in staying on top of the rapid changes 
in the capital inflows affecting monetary policy. Following a 
recent round of discussions with IMF officials, the central bank 
agreed to target economic growth of 8 per cent for this year, 
inflation at 4.2 percent against 3.3 percent last year and the 
current account deficit at 5.4 percent of the GDP. 
  In international trade, exports are projected to surge 14.6 
percent this year to 1,507 billion baht, against import growth 
of 13.8 percent to 1,301 billion baht -- resulting in a trade 
deficit to around 244 billion baht. The current account deficit 
will reach 189 billion baht, equivalent to 5.4 percent of the 
GDP. Net capital inflow will fall slightly from last year's 294 
billion baht to 271 billion baht this year. Cash surplus will 
also drop slightly, from 98.8 billion baht to 1994's 82 billion 
baht. 
  On the fiscal side, the 1994 budget will post a 44.7 billion 
baht surplus, compared to 69 billion baht in the 1993 budget. 
This is equivalent to 1.3 percent of the GDP. On the monetary 
side, credit in the commercial banking system is expected to 
surge by 21.7 percent, compared to an 19.6 percent growth in 
deposits. The balance will be filled by foreign capital.

  [Text] THE Council of Economic Ministers yesterday 
approved another round of customs tariff reform for electronic 
and electrical goods, mechanical goods, optical products and 
machinery with the aim of improving local production efficiency 
in the long run. 
  Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin said the reforms, which 
take effect today, feature both lower tariff rates for 417 items 
of goods under those categories and lesser tax rates to be 
applied to those goods. 
  The average tax rate for those products has been reduced by 
half from 28 percent to only 14 percent and 39 different tax 
rates for those 417 items have been reduced to only six rates to 
make taxation easier. 
  The reduction of the number of rates has been made through 
reclassifying those products according to their nature -- 
namely, finished products, semi-finished products and raw 
materials. 
  The minister said total imports of the 417 items last year 
reached 120 billion baht or 11 percent of the country's total 
imports. 
  The reforms would deprive the Government of 6.4 billion baht 
in tax collection a year, he said, adding that this would be 
compensated by benefits to local industries in the long run. 
  Export-oriented industries in particular would benefit from 
the scheme as their production costs would become more 
competitive in the international market while other producers in 
the country would have to improve efficiency to compete with 
cheaper imports. 
  The details of the rate adjustments are as follows: 
  -- Imports of 78 items of electronic goods including 
capacitors, resistors, diodes and transistors will be subject to 
a new tax rate of 1 percent against 0-35 percent in the past. 
  -- Imports of 37 items of machinery such as movie cameras, 
machinery used together with boilers, and construction 
machinery, engines, fans, air and oil filters for automobiles, 
and high voltage regulators will be subject to a new rate of 5 
percent instead of 5-40 percent. 
  -- Imports of 94 items of semi-finished products including 
ball bearings, electric motors, switches, fuses, plugs and 
relays, cathode tubes, optic fibre and cable and camera lenses 
will be subject to a new rate of 10 percent instead of 1-35 
percent. 
  -- Imports of 208 items of finished products such as copying 
machines, cash dispensers, coin sorting machines, hair dryers, 
telephone sets, light bulbs, batteries, movie projectors, slide 
projectors, camera flashes, vacuum cleaners, microwave ovens, 
microphones, loudspeakers, tape and video tape (recorded) and 
disc players will be subject to a new tax rate of 20 and 30 
percent instead of 0-60 percent.

  [Text] At a banquet held in honor of visiting Philippine 
President Fidel Ramos in Hanoi, SRV President Le Duc Anh said: 
On behalf of the Vietnamese state and people, I warmly welcome 
President Fidel Ramos, the first President of the Philippines on 
an official friendship visit to Vietnam, and other distinguished 
Philippine guests. 
  We are pleased to note that the relations of friendship and 
multifaceted cooperation between our two countries, during the 
past period, have consistently strengthened and expanded. The 
exchange visits of high-level delegations of the two countries 
have contributed to significantly developing this relationship 
and strengthening mutual understanding and trust between the two 
countries. 
  In recent years, there have been great and fundamental 
changes in the regional and world situations. The most 
outstanding feature is that nations wish to attain peace, 
stability, and security in order to develop further. The trend 
of regional cooperation is vigorously developing. 
  We highly appraise the Philippine Government's efforts to 
support Vietnam becoming an ASEAN observer, to encourage it to 
participate in the regional cooperation mechanism, and to invite 
it to join ASEAN at an appropriate time. I am firmly convinced 
that the visit to Vietnam by the Philippine president will be 
crowned with success, thus opening up a new chapter in the 
relations of friendship and cooperation between our two nations 
for the interests of the two peoples and for peace, stability, 
cooperation, and prosperity in Southeast Asia and the world. 
  President Le Duc Anh proposed a toast for the development of 
the relations of friendship and multifaceted cooperation between 
Vietnam and the Philippines, for the happiness and prosperity of 
the Vietnamese and Philippine peoples, for peace and progress in 
Southeast Asia, and for the good health of the Philippine 
President and the distinguished guests. 
  In the reply speech, President Fidel Ramos sincerely thanked 
President Le Duc Anh for his kind words and hospitality extended 
to the Philippine delegation. 
  President Fidel Ramos stressed that this is the first visit 
by a Philippine President to Vietnam. As a result, the visit is 
a significant event in the history of the two nations. He said: 
The purpose of my visit is to restore our relations, which were 
interposed by history. The president further said: The 
foundation of friendship between the two nations has been 
strengthened since the establishment of diplomatic relations 
after the reunification of Vietnam. Our relations were further 
consolidated when we reached agreements in 1978 and 1992 to 
respect each other's national dependence, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity. 
  After asserting the Philippines' commitment to these 
agreements, President Fidel Ramos stressed: Manila was proud to 
host a forum two years ago at which Vietnam gained access to the 
Southeast Asia Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation and became 
an observer to ASEAN. On that occasion ASEAN approved the 
Manila Declaration on the Eastern Sea and Vietnam promptly 
welcomed the declaration. The Philippine president contends 
that the sooner Vietnam joins ASEAN the better for ASEAN and 
Southeast Asia. 
  Dealing with the conflict in the Eastern Sea, the Philippine 
President said: We should not focus on suspicion among countries 
in the region but should concentrate on promoting cooperation to 
achieve mutual trust among countries concerned. 
  After reviewing the similarities between the two countries 
and their common wish to expand bilateral relations in the 
economic, cultural, social, investment, and tourism domains, the 
Philippine President recalled that, in a famous message to the 
Philippine people, President Ho Chi Minh wrote: Only when the 
root is firm can the tree live longer. President Fidel Ramos 
expressed the wish to promote and strengthen the relations of 
friendship and cooperation between the two countries. 
  The Philippine President proposed a toast for the happiness 
and prosperity of the Vietnamese people, for the development and 
long-lasting relations between the Philippines and Vietnam, and 
for the good health of President Le Duc Anh.

  [Text] President Ramos is now heading for Ho Chi Minh City 
on the second day of his three-day official visit to the 
Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The presidential party will land 
at Tan Son Nhat International Airport at 1815. He will be met 
at the a?rport by Phan Chanh Truk, people's committee vice 
chairman, and Vu Hac Bong, foreign affairs director. A dinner 
honoring the president will be hosted by Truong Tan Sang, 
chairman of Ho Chi Minh's People's Committee. 
  During the president's first night in Vietnam, he was a 
guest 
at a dinner hosted by Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh. It was 
on this occasion that he proposed the demilitarization of the 
Spratly Islands. The president said that the tension in the 
Spratly Islands will be eliminated if the six countries claiming 
the islands agree to pull out their respective forces there. 
  [Begin Ramos recording in English] I therefore propose that 
all the claimant states and other Southeast Asian nations 
jointly study matters related to the possible demilitarization 
of the area; a freeze on all destabilizing activities; marine 
research and environmental protection; joint development 
ventures; confidence-building measures among the elements in the 
area; and, similar cooperative undertakings for the benefit of 
all. [end recording] 
  In a news conference at Hanoi, the president emphasized the 
importance of his visit to Vietnam. 
  [Begin Ramos recording in progress, in English]...with the 
vigorous economies of Southeast Asia. I regard this trip to the 
Socialist Republic of Vietnam as one of the most significant I 
have made. With Vietnam and the other Southeast Asian states, 
the Philippines has a shared destiny. There is no alternative 
to peace and economic cooperation among us in this region that 
we all inhabit. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, the president had the chance to visit the 
Mausoleum of Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam's revolutionary leader. The 
president also visited the assembly plant of Vietnam Motors 
Corporation [VMC]. Here is a report from David Jude Sta. Ana: 
  [Begin recording in English] [Sta. Ana] President Ramos 
paid tribute to Vietnam's past -- offering a wreath at the 
mausoleum of the late Ho Chi Minh -- considered as the founding 
father of the unified Vietnam. He is fondly remembered as Uncle 
Ho. Ho Chi Minh led the struggle for liberation from France and 
the United States. Ironically, however, Ho Chi Minh died before 
his dream of a unified Vietnam was realized in 1975. 
  Today, also, the president paid tribute to the future 
economic cooperation between Manila and Hanoi. In his visit to 
the Vietnam Motors Corporation assembly plant, Mr. Ramos urged 
Filipino businessmen to forge more joint venture deals with the 
Vietnamese and other Asian industries. Formed in 1992, the VMC 
is a partnership between Filipinos and Vietnamese with the help 
of Japanese and Korean car manufacturers. Manila-based 
Columbian Motors Corporation owns 70 percent of the firm, while 
Vietnam's Transportation Ministry owns the rest. 
  [Ramos] There are some among our countrymen who think, and I 
say, they think very wrongly, that when Filipino financiers, 
managers, and experts export their services and their technical 
expertise abroad that the Philippines loses. That is not 
correct. Jobs are also being created for our countrymen because 
they must run the shops, they must operate the factories that 
produce spare parts, components, and set assemblies for this 
factory in Vietnam. 
  [Sta. Ana] Last year alone, $7 million worth of 
Philippine-made components were used by the VMC. The plant is 
run by 11 Filipino supervisors, and VMC General Manager Butch 
Roa said they plan to enter into more joint venture deals with 
other car firms, and business has been good. 
  [Roa] Government is very...the government is very pragmatic. 
If they have a decision which is not suitable to your 
requirements and you appeal to them, they listen. They listen 
and they adopt. 
  [Sta. Ana] This plant which currently employs 300 will 
expand operations later this year, assembling the BMW 5 series 
which will be sold to foreign nationals here in Vietnam, which 
is a growing market. [end recording]

  [Text] A call by Philippine President Fidel Ramos for more 
contacts among claimants of the disputed Spratly Islands in the 
South China Sea which will eventually lead to "demilitarisation" 
of the area drew a receptive response from Vietnam, a senior 
Philippine government official said here yesterday. 
  President Ramos arrived in Hanoi on Monday for a three-day 
official visit. He held talks with Vietnamese President Le Duc 
Anh, Communist Party chief Do Muoi and Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet. 
  The Philippines and Vietnam are among six claimants of the 
Spratly Islands. With the exception of Brunei, the two 
countries along with China, Taiwan and Malaysia, have maintained 
various degrees of military presence in the area. 
  Speaking at a press conference before heading for southern 
Ho 
Chi Minh City yesterday Ramos said his proposal for more 
contacts as well as for joint resources development in the 
Spratlys is aimed at defusing tension in the region. 
  "We agreed on the need to devise confidence-building 
mechanisms -- cooperative ventures in the area -- that will 
assure the claimant countries and the rest of the region that 
the South China Sea can be transformed from waters of contention 
to an area of cooperation," he said. 
  Ramos added that he also mentioned to the Vietnamese leaders 
"the need to agree on demilitarisation" of the Spratlys. 
  Elaborating on his president's remarks, Undersecretary for 
Foreign Affairs Rodolfo Severino told reporters that 
demilitarisation of the Spratlys should be achieved in an Asian 
way, which is "gradual, step by step, in a consensual manner." 
  The Philippine and Vietnamese leaders also said they would 
like to encourage informal contacts from top level down to local 
commanders among the claimant parties, with a view to reducing 
tension in dealing with the Spratlys, according to Severino. 
  Vietnam has constantly reiterated its sovereignty over the 
Spratlys and the Paracels in which the latter is also in 
bilateral contention with China. 
  Stressing that the proposal for joint studies towards 
military reduction and joint resource development is new to 
Vietnam, Severino said Vietnam nevertheless found this "an 
interesting" idea. 
  The ASEAN Regional Forum, to be held this July in Bangkok 
and 
to which Vietnam is invited to attend, will steer clear from 
controversial issues such as disputed claims over the Spratlys, 
he said. 
  While in Hanoi, President Ramos also presided over the 
signing of several bilateral agreements covering trade, culture, 
tourism and the set-up of a Joint Commission for Bilateral 
Cooperation. 
  The two countries said they would try to increase bilateral 
trade, which last year amounted to only US$48 million, 
facilitate Vietnamese rice for Philippine fertiliser barter 
arrangements, as well as work to establish direct shipping 
services.

  [Text] Filipino President Fidel Ramos has described his 
tour of Vietnam as one of the most significant visits he has 
ever made. He told the media on Tuesday before leaving Hanoi 
that the Philippines, together with Vietnam and other countries 
in Southeast Asia, wish to share a common destiny and there is 
no other alternatives than promotion of economic cooperation and 
construction of peace among them. The president supported 
Vietnam's succession to ASEAN. He expressed readiness to share 
his country's experience to build infrastructure and a legal 
system in Vietnam. He maintained that the two countries have 
large opportunities in scientific, technological, educational, 
and health cooperation. 
  Before leaving Hanoi, President Fidel Ramos held a press 
conference. 
  [Begin Ramos recording in English] I have, like other heads 
of government in other parts of the world, been covering [words 
indistinct]. In an effort to develop [word indistinct] 
activities in our foreign relations, [word indistinct] the 
Philippines cannot [word indistinct] with the vigorous economies 
of Southeast Asia. I regard this trip to the Socialist Republic 
of Vietnam as a one of the most significant I have made. With 
Vietnam and the other Southeast Asian states, the Philippines 
has a shared destiny. There is no alternative for peace than 
economic cooperation among us in this region that we are 
inhabit. In Manila in 1992, Vietnam acceded to the Bali Treaty 
of the ASEAN nations which binds signatories to settle regional 
disputes peaceably. Vietnam's full membership in ASEAN is now a 
matter [words indistinct] in principle but mainly of time and 
procedure. I reiterated to Vietnam's leaders the consistent 
support of the Philippines to help facilitate Vietnam's entry 
into ASEAN. They in turn informed me of their intensive 
preparations for full participation in ASEAN activities. 
  Philippine-Vietnamese relations are a critical factor for 
the 
solidarity of Southeast Asia and consequently for the peace and 
progress of the region. I believe my visit greatly enhances 
these relations. I had friendly and fruitful meetings with 
President Le Duc Anh, General Secretary Do Muoi of the Communist 
Party of Vietnam, and Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh; and I look 
forward to our meeting with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet later 
today. 
  Like our own leadership, Vietnam's leaders are all acutely 
aware of their country's need for regional stability so that 
they can have the breathing spell after four generations of 
almost continuous conflict to shape their economy and [word 
indistinct] self- sustaining role. With them I explored avenues 
of possible cooperation among the claimants to areas of the 
South China Sea and other nations of Southeast Asia in order to 
reduce tensions in the area and to promote joint development as 
called for in the 1994 Manila Declaration. We agreed on the 
need to devise confidence building mechanisms, cooperative 
ventures in the area that will begin to assure the claimant 
countries of the archipelagoes that the South China Sea can be 
transformed from waters of contention into an area of 
cooperation. We agreed that the increasingly favorable economic 
situation in Vietnam should make it easier for our two countries 
to work out the repatriation of the Vietnamese asylum seekers in 
the Philippines. My delegation also looked intensively into the 
opportunities for countertrade and into investments and joint 
ventures in each other's economies. 
  We offered the help of our industrialists, academics, 
managers, and technologists in the building of Vietnam's 
infrastructure, in financial management, in legislative policy 
formulation, and in running the tourist facilities. We agreed 
there is great room for our two countries to collaborate in 
science and technology, education, and public health. And we 
agreed to exert every effort to raise the level of trade between 
us and to make and to take every advantage of complimentarities 
between our two economies. [end recording]

Representative Mickey Kantor's grim assessment of the plan, a 
government source said Wednesday [30 March]. The source was 
commenting on Kantor's overnight comments in Washington that the 
measures, announced in Tokyo on Tuesday, do not meet U.S. 
concerns on bilateral trade issues ranging from auto trade to 
government procurement. 
  The source also stressed that Japan expects to announce an 
additional market-opening package in June for presentation at 
the Group of Seven (G-7) summit of industrial nations set for 
July in Naples, Italy. He also expressed hope that the latest 
package will lead to a resumption of bilateral "framework" trade 
talks that broke down in mid-February.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone Corp. (NTT) said Tuesday [29 March] it will review its 
procurement policy under a 1981 Japan-U.S. agreement as part of 
efforts to increase foreign companies' opportunities for 
NTT-related business. 
  Japan's telecommunications giant privatized in 1985 will 
improve its procedures for buying components and other products 
for use in equipment to facilitate foreign companies' access to 
NTT business, a company spokesman said. 
  Specifically, NTT will provide prospective bidders with 
information on its procurement plans before they are unveiled in 
the government's official gazettes, the spokesman said. At 
present, such information can be obtained only after specific 
procurement plans are made public in the gazettes. 
  The latest step follows a U.S. request that the Japanese 
Government treat NTT purchases as part of its procurements. The 
government has rejected the request, saying that NTT "is 
basically a private business," not a government agency. 
  The 1981 pact calls for nondiscriminatory treatment of 
foreign bidders by NTT in its procurement policy. "NTT will 
maximize its efforts to respond to foreign demand," the 
spokesman said.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
and the South Korean puppets staged a war exercise directed 
against the North of Korea on March 28, creating a strong 
electronic jamming in the air above Yongwol, Chunchon, Kongju 
and Oeyon Islet, according to military sources. 
  It involved overseas-based flying corps including 
nuclear-capable F-16 fighter-bombers plus fighter-bombers, 
assault planes and observation planes belonging to the U.S. 
Airforce in South Korea and the South Korean puppet Airforce, 
more than 300 in all. 
  An RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane flew over the 
military demarcation line (MDL) area that day for photographing 
and electronic espionage on the whole areas of the North. 
  On the same day, formations of helicopter gunships and 
transport helicopters of the puppet army staged exercises for 
supporting ground units in an attack and airlifting in the air 
above Paju and Yonchon Counties, Kyonggi Province, while 105 mm 
artillery units fired scores of shells at an area adjacent to 
the Demilitarized Zone of the MDL. 
  The war moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
puppets against the North are driving the situation of the 
Korean peninsula to the brink of war.

<F P=106> ["Invincibility of DPRK" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
are increasing their military threat to the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea. But the U.S. bellicose elements are making a 
mistake. 
  Socialism of Korea is an invincible socialism which cannot 
be 
destroyed with anything. 
  The kernel of the invincibility of the DPRK is the great 
singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses. 
The community of destiny, an integral whole of ideology and 
purpose in which ideology is one, and the destiny and weal and 
woe are shared by all -- this is the singlehearted unity of 
Korea. This singlehearted unity in which the leader, the party 
and the masses form a harmonious whole is a unity which is 
hardened like steel in a grim test. In March last year a 
touch-and-go crisis was created, which might trigger off a war 
any moment, due to the reckless war manoeuvres of the U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean authorities. In a few days 
more than 1.5 million young people volunteered to the Korean 
People's Army. Five million youths and students vowed to defend 
their leader, their party and the socialist homeland with their 
lives, becoming 5 million rifles and 5 million bombs. Hundreds 
of thousands of veterans rose up like a giant, shouting "we will 
take charge of defence." The entire people effected a great 
upswing in socialist construction with a rifle in one hand and a 
sickle or a hammer in the other. This is the strength of 
singlehearted unity mightier than thousands of nuclear bombs. 
  With this singlehearted unity, the Korean people are afraid 
of nothing and have no unconquerable fortress. 
  The DPRK is invincible as it has a matchless army which has 
grown under the guidance of the great brilliant commander. 
  The People's Army is mighty Armed Forces with both modern 
offensive and defensive means. Each man of it is prepared to be 
the match for a hundred. He is an indomitable soldier with 
faith and will to defend with his life the leader, the party and 
the motherland under any circumstances. 
  The entire people are armed and the whole country is 
fortified in Korea. The Worker-Peasant Red Guards and Young Red 
Guards are fully ready for defending the country. The defence 
industry guarantees the military equipment needed for the 
defence of the country. 
  Though the imperialists put pressure upon Korea, threatening 
economic "sanctions", the independent national economy remains 
unshaken. This is another source of the invincibility of the 
DPRK. 
  The Korean people have lived and are prepared to live on 
rice 
produced by them, clothes produced by them and daily necessities 
produced by them. 
  The U.S. imperialists must not run wild. They may dispatch 6 
million troops, not 600,000, and may deploy much more formidable 
missiles than Patriot. But they cannot frighten the Korean 
people. 
  The United States must ponder over the matter. If one likes 
fire he is bound to get burnt.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- Pyongyangites held a 
rally today bitterly denouncing the plan of the U.S. 
imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam group to deploy Patriot 
missiles in South Korea. 
  Paek Hak-yon, permanent vice-chairman of the Pyongyang 
Municipal People's Committee, and other speakers branded the 
planned deployment of Patriot missiles as a blatant challenge to 
the nation's desire for peace and denuclearisation of the Korean 
peninsula and an unpardonable act to exterminate the nation 
through a nuclear war by deliberately increasing the tension. 
  They declared they would not pardon the brigands who 
reversed 
the DPRK-U.S. joint statement and steps of simultaneous action 
agreed upon at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York and are 
threatening the DPRK with "sanctions." 
  The Korean people are not frightened by any missile and the 
Team Spirit nuclear war game, they said, warning that the U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique must refrain 
from reckless war moves and other rash acts. 
  The speakers declared that the Korean people and the 
People's 
Army closely united around General Kim Chong-il, their supreme 
commander, will smash the aggressors at one blow if they dare 
provoke socialist Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, March 30 (YONHAP) -- Vice Foreign Minister 
Hong Sun-yong suggested Tuesday the imposition of phased 
sanctions on North Korea to solve the nuclear problem, starting 
with a cutoff of all aid and even exchanges on peaceful use of 
atomic power. 
  "We have to press North Korea by stages in order to solve 
the 
nuclear problem," Hong told a conference of the ruling camp's 
chapter leaders. 
  "We will continue to show our efforts for a peaceful 
resolution in order to secure Chinese participation, but phased 
sanctions are inevitable after a statement by the UN Security 
Council president," he said. 
  The council initially planned on adopting a resolution 
demanding that Pyongyang allow inspection of its suspected 
facilities, but has backed away to a presidential statement in 
the face of Chinese opposition. 
  The statement is likely to be issued this week or next week. 
  Possible sanctions could start with a halt to technical 
assistance and exchanges on peaceful use of atomic energy, then 
move to a ban on all exchanges of strategic materials, a ban on 
money transfers or trade in raw materials, and finally to a full 
embargo, Hong said. 
  "The North Korean economy would be fatally wounded even if 
just 5 to 10 percent of its crude oil supply or money from 
Chochongnyon in Japan was embargoed," the vice foreign minister 
said. 
  Chochongnyon is an association of pro-North Korea residents 
operating in Japan. 
  North Korean-U.S. diplomatic normalization would take 
considerable time because it requires not only an international 
consensus but an understanding of bilateral issues including 
American POWs, missile export controls and human rights, said 
Hong. 
  On the results of President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China, 
Hong said he was under the impression that Beijing had 
emphasized its commitment to a peaceful solution rather than 
sanctions. 
  "It seems to indicate China is unwilling to provoke North 
Korea," he said.

  [Text] Australia's new trade minister, Bob McMullen, 
reaffirmed yesterday his country's desire to see the Asia 
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group start moving towards a 
free trade agreement, perhaps in the next two years. 
  Because of the sensitivity of the idea, he was careful not 
to 
set out a specific timetable. But "this year and next year 
could be crunch years for APEC" to show some concrete results, 
he said. 
  Trade liberalisation is an issue that is "coming to the 
fore" 
in 1994, and Australia wants to see trade liberalisation within 
the group "when people are ready for it" he said. 
  APEC should liberalise at a pace that its 17 members find 
"comfortable", but not "proceeding at the pace of the slowest 
country". 
  Mr McMullen's comments come at a time when Thai officials 
are 
talking about a rethink of the country's policy towards APEC and 
other regional economic groupings. 
  The officials identify the United States and Australia as 
the 
two APEC members pressing hardest for economic integration 
within the group. 
  They are particularly concerned about the failure of 
Thailand 
and other ASEAN countries to influence APEC's agenda and to 
resist what they see as less desirable developments in the group. 
  Thailand and ASEAN fear that the larger nations will use 
APEC 
as a forum for exerting pressure on the smaller countries, for 
example to obtain lower trade barriers, tighter protection for 
intellectual property rights and market-opening in service 
industries. 
  APEC would be used, Thai officials fear, to make commitments 
that go beyond what has been agreed globally in the Uruguay 
Round of trade talks. 
  Some Thai officials say the government needs a clearer 
assessment of where APEC is heading so that Thai and ASEAN 
responses can be prepared ahead of time. 
  So far, they say, the steady insertion of new items on the 
five-year-old group's agenda -- by Australia and the United 
States in particular -- has subtly but swiftly shifted APEC away 
from the loose grouping that ASEAN initially accepted. 
  At each stage, they conclude, ASEAN was caught unprepared. 
  The Australians have always argued openly that if APEC is to 
be meaningful it should work for trade liberalisation. The 
Americans, on the other hand, have repeatedly stated that they 
have an open mind about APEC's development. 
  The Thai officials take a different view, citing in 
particular a draft investment code that US officials are 
circulating for comment by APEC members, and proposals for trade 
liberalisation contained in a report by a group of "eminent 
persons" commissioned by APEC. The group's chairman is an 
influential US economist, Fred Bergsten. 
  Some Thais contrast the Australian pressure for trade 
liberalisation on a broad front with what they describe as the 
Americans' gradual introduction of new issues such as the 
investment code and financial services liberalisation. 
  One Thai official recently recounted how APEC had started 
off 
as a "loose consultative forum" when it was launched at its 
first ministerial meeting in Canberra in late 1989. 
  After that, work programmes were introduced on a number of 
topics, ranging from the creation of trade databases to human 
resources development. Those programmes needed funding, which 
led to an APEC budget and a secretariat. 
  Last year saw US President Bill Clinton host the first of 
what is increasingly seen as a regular series of APEC leaders' 
meetings, and the creation of a new APEC committee on trade and 
investment. This month APEC finance ministers met for the first 
time. 
  The official said this demonstrates how far ASEAN has 
allowed 
APEC's original shape to be eroded. Other officials say ASEAN 
should counterattack by proposing its own agenda so that APEC's 
emphasis can return to areas of interest to smaller countries, 
for example training and technology transfer. 
  There are some differences of opinion in the Thai 
bureaucracy. While some Thai officials talk of hidden agendas 
and a US "master-plan" for APEC, others question whether the 
Clinton administration would be able to pass APEC trade 
liberalisation laws through Congress. 
  Some Thai officials believe the conclusion of the Uruguay 
Round of world trade talks could ease some of the pressure for 
specific trade agreements in APEC. 
  For example, earlier suggestions that APEC might handle 
trade 
disputes between its members might be dropped because the 
Uruguay Round deal includes a stronger and more streamlined 
dispute settlement process under the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade. 
  The possibility of APEC being a forum for the United States 
and Japan to patch up their bilateral trade dispute was raised 
yesterday when Mr McMullen was interviewed in a 
television-telephone link-up with Canberra. 
  "APEC is not a dispute settlement body," he said. But he 
added that APEC meetings could be occasions for ministers from 
the two countries to discuss their differences. 
  Mr McMullen said that while Australia is concerned about the 
Japanese trade surplus, Canberra opposes Washington's use of 
unilateral pressure to try to force Japanese markets open. 
  One of the reasons why US companies have insisted on the 
controversial numerical targets set by Washington for access to 
Japanese markets is the fact that earlier American success in 
lowering Japan's trade barriers against beef led to a surge in 
Japanese beef imports from countries, including Australia.

  [Excerpt] Sen. Blas F. Ople, chairman of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, called on the national government 
yesterday to lead other members of the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) in an intensified diplomacy to defuse the 
atmosphere of gathering war in the Korean peninsula. 
  Ople said that the use of economic sanctions by the United 
Nations against an already isolated North Korea could force a 
desperate and paranoid government in Pyongyang to consider the 
war option which can drag the Philippines and other Asian 
countries in a new, unpredictable international crisis. 
  What makes the situation volatile is the unpredictability of 
the Korean leadership which is composed of "mysterious, shadowy 
personalities and very little is known about them," he said. 
  North Korea, the last Stalinist state in the world, has a 
mutual defense treaty with the People's Republic of China (PRC), 
the world's most populous nation. Its two top leaders are Kim 
Il-song and his son Kim Chong-il, "who is more erratic than his 
father," Ople told Senate reporters. 
  "No one doubts that both father and son are capable of going 
to war against all odds," Ople observed as the clouds of war 
loomed over the divided Korean peninsula as a result of North 
Korea's refusal to allow United Nations' inspection of its 
nuclear facilities. 
  President Clinton, acting on the request of the U.S. 
commander in South Korea representing the United Nations, has 
ordered the dispatch and installation of "Patriot" missiles as a 
counter measure against the North Korean's, heightening tension 
in the Asian region. 
  "North Korea itself is an arms bazaar where routinely Middle 
East countries shop for missiles. Some of the scud missiles 
(bought from North Korea) were used in Iraq by Saddam Husayn who 
is 10 times more predictable than Kim," Ople said. 
  Technically, the Korean War which began in 1950 has not 
ended, although the armistice at Panmunjon negotiated in 1953 
has held up for nearly four decades. Any resumption of 
hostilities will mean activating a multinational force to face 
an invasion of South Korea, Ople said. 
  He expressed hopes that the Department of Foreign Affairs 
(DFA) and Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), along with 
the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), have contingency 
plans as there are an estimated 40,000 Filipinos in South Korea.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA March 29 -- Prime Minister [P.M.] Vo Van 
Kiet and Philippine President Fidel Ramos today had an exchange 
of views on the development of the Vietnam-Philippine 
relationship and cooperation. 
  Also present were Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, Minister 
of Agriculture and Food Industry Nguyen Cong Tan, and Trade 
Minister Le Van Triet. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and President Fidel Ramos 
expressed their pleasure at the fine development of the 
friendship and cooperation between the two countries, especially 
after the Vietnamese prime minister's visit to the Philippines 
early 1992. 
  P.M. Kiet outlined orientations and measures to further 
promote the Vietnam-Philippine cooperation in the fields of 
commerce, economy, culture, tourism, science and technology on 
the basis of agreements on cooperation signed recently in Hanoi. 
The prime minister said he hoped that Vietnam would receive 
cooperation and assistance from the Philippines in the areas of 
science and technology, personnel training and natural calamity 
preparedness. He said Vietnam was ready to cooperate with the 
Philippines in health care and aquaculture. 
  For his part, President Fidel Ramos spoke highly of the 
progress and growth of the economic, commercial cooperation 
between the two countries in the past, as well as of the 
orientations and measures to develop the two countries' 
long-term cooperation in the future. The Philippine president 
said that with a sense of creating security and stable 
environment in the region, the Philippine Government would 
strive to push up the multi-faceted cooperation for mutual 
benefit with Vietnam, encourage businessmen to invest in 
Vietnam, be prepared to share experiences with Vietnam, and help 
it train economic and technological personnel. 
  P.M. Kiet and President Ramos also compared notes on the 
developments in the region and international issues of common 
concern. The two sides agreed that all outstanding problems 
should be settled in conformity with the interests of the 
region. They also held that only peace and security in the 
region be maintained, can development in each country be ensured. 
  Later, Prime Minister Kiet gave a dinner to President Ramos.

<F P=106> [By commentator Naohiro Amaya, director of the Dentsu </F>
Research Institute; from the "Reading the Times" column: 
"Security in the Post-Cold War Era"] 
  [Text] If we look back at the Cold War era, we would never 
refer to it as the good times. But compared with the present, 
things were simple and clear-cut back then. Values could be 
classified into two categories: communist or noncommunist. Most 
countries belonged to either the communist or noncommunist bloc. 
Only a handful of countries remained nonaligned and neutral, and 
these were of little geopolitical significance. 
  Regardless of whether it be the U.S. or Soviet bloc, there 
was a strong stranglehold from the center against outlying 
areas. For example, under the former Soviet structure, it was 
inconceivable for the DPRK (North Korea) to engage in such acts 
as developing nuclear weapons on its own. The two blocs armed 
themselves with nuclear weapons and contested their destructive 
power. By expanding their "mutual assured destruction" 
capabilities in the form of simple, clear-cut figures, and by 
acknowledging a balance based on a sense of fear which existed 
between them, the two blocs were able to maintain a chilly state 
of peace on a global scale. 
  With the end of the Cold War, the structure of conflict 
between the United States and the Soviet Union collapsed, and 
the threat of nuclear war faded. However, the forces that moved 
the world became dispersed, creating a complicated structure and 
making it difficult to grasp the situation in terms of figures. 
  In Bosnia, tribal, ethnic, and religious strife as well as 
distrust and hatred have accumulated over hundreds of years and 
have now risen to nearly uncontrollable levels. Bosnia is just 
one example; there exists many similar situations throughout the 
world. 
  Looking at the situation in Bosnia, it can be acknowledged 
that the people there are hardly capable of restoring order. 
Therefore, the United Nations and regional organizations such 
as NATO have been asked to deploy military forces. 
  However, as exemplified in Somalia and Bosnia, the 
"superhero" capabilities of the United Nations and other 
organizations are very limited. In these cases, nuclear weapons 
are worthless; it may be like trying to use oversized spears in 
a confined fighting space. 
  To restore order in bogged down regional conflicts, it would 
be necessary to deploy massive conventional forces and 
policemen. However, there is hardly any country that can get its 
people's consent to bear such risks and costs. 
  Although this situation must be rectified, enormous effort 
and considerable time will be required to carry it out. It must 
be acknowledged that, for the time being, the international 
community lacks effective means of dealing with Bosnia-type 
conflicts. In that case, what will follow an era of "chilly 
peace" is probably an era of "dubious peace." In such an era, 
what can be considered vitally important as security measures 
will be: first, to try to detect sparks of war well in advance, 
and second, to do all that can be done to prevent conflicts from 
spreading to surrounding areas. 
  Looking at the regions surrounding Japan, it goes without 
saying that the most dubious area is the Korean peninsula. The 
following possibilities can be considered in regards to the 
danger on the Korean peninsula: 1) use of nuclear weapons by 
North Korea; 2) North Korea's invasion of the ROK via 
conventional forces; and 3) abrupt internal collapse in North 
Korea. As for the first two possibilities, it would be an act 
of suicide for North Korea as long as the United States is 
firmly determined to retaliate. In this regard, it is hoped the 
United States would give a clear signal to North Korea, with no 
room for any misunderstanding. 
  There exist hardly any common terms other than "carrot and 
stick" between North Korea and normal countries. Therefore, 
countries such as the United States, the ROK, and Japan should 
hold a strong stick while hanging tasty carrots before North 
Korea, and corner it into making a choice. If North Korea 
should keep on playing with fire, these countries should try to 
convince it to stop doing so by showing that continuing to do so 
would only do it more harm than good. 
  It is also necessary to exercise adequate caution regarding 
the danger of provoking internal collapse in North Korea should 
the stick policy turn out to be too strong. It should not be 
forgotten, also, that even if the stick were not used, the 
danger of internal collapse continues to exist. In case of 
internal collapse, military threats may diminish for the time 
being, but there would arise increased danger of the development 
of a situation on the Korean peninsula similar to the Bosnian 
situation, and it may continue for a long time. 
  In short, the crisis on the Korean peninsula is similar to 
Bosnia in that it cannot be resolved easily. To deal with this 
situation, we must stop employing the simple binary-style way of 
thinking [nishin-ho-teki hasso] as was done in the Cold War era. 
We have now entered an era where it is necessary to "learn 
about the foe, as well as about oneself" in order to carry out a 
highly intellectual diplomacy which combines hardness with 
softness, flexibility with firmness.

  [Excerpt] During a session of the House of Representatives 
Budget Committee on 30 March, Taro Nakayama of the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party asked Prime Minister Hosokawa how the 
government will deal with economic sanctions against North 
Korea, which is suspected of developing nuclear weapons, if the 
UN Security Council votes to impose sanctions on it. In response 
to the question, the prime minister said, "Each ministry and 
agency is now studying the concrete ways possible within its 
administrative jurisdiction to deal with the economic 
sanctions." The prime minister also stressed that "Japan will 
have to carry out complete preparations." In this way, the 
prime minister made it clear that the government is now studying 
a wide range of measures to deal with the economic sanctions and 
to maintain public peace and order in Japan. 
  During the session, Sadao Yamahana, the minister in charge 
of 
political reform from the Social Democratic Party, was asked how 
he will deal with the issue of North Korea's nuclear development 
program. In response, Mr. Yamahana echoed the prime minister's 
statement, saying, "As a cabinet member, I will deal with the 
issue in a responsible manner within the limits of the 
Constitution." 
  Testifying before the session, Shigetake Ogata, Public 
Security Investigation Agency director general, stated, "Of the 
ethnic Koreans residing in Japan, approximately 247,000 have 
some relationship with the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan, and approximately 56,000 of them are 
formally affiliated with the pro-North Korean organization in 
Japan." As for the amount of their remittances to North Korea, 
Mr. Ogata said, "We possess no accurate measure of the 
remittances," but he added, "rumors have it that the amount 
ranges from 60 billion yen to 80 billion yen a year." [passage 
omitted on Hosokawa's acceptance of a loan from the Sagawa 
Kyubin company]

  [Text] On 30 March, the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
established an "emergency project team on Northeast Asian 
affairs," which is chaired by Policy Research Council Chairman 
Ryutaro Hashimoto, in a bid to deal with the international 
situation concerning possible sanctions against the DPRK (North 
Korea). From now on, the team plans to meet once a week to 
study from an independent standpoint what form Japan's crisis 
control should take. The project team intends to present 
emergency proposals to the government if the situation becomes 
more tense.

  [Text] As of 29 March, five major Japanese automakers have 
formulated their plans to increase purchases of foreign auto 
parts in particular. In their plans, the automakers came up 
with financial targets concerning their purchases, because they 
took into account the ongoing bilateral frictions over the 
automobile sector. In trying desperately to avoid having their 
targets be considered commitments, however, automakers are 
trying to put across their individual plans through such means 
as setting different fiscal years as their respective target 
periods. While praising such efforts by the private sector, the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] remains very 
sensitive to how the United States will now respond, saying that 
"the atmosphere in Washington is quite severe" (as stated by a 
top MITI official). 
  Although the five automakers' procurement plans cover all 
overseas products, they focus primarily on importing more auto 
parts and completely assembled automobiles from the United 
States. Automakers have avoided disclosing their data on past 
purchases, and they have also set different fiscal years as 
target periods. However, if we dare add up all the figures 
listed in the automakers' finalized purchase plans, the total 
purchases of auto parts come to approximately $23 billion. 
  This figure surpasses the target figure of $17.8 billion 
which the five automakers had to share and meet when it was 
announced during U.S. President George Bush's visit to Japan in 
1992 that Japan would "purchase $19 billion worth of auto parts 
in fiscal year 1994." However, the figure falls far short of 
the expectations of the U.S. automobile industry, which is 
"demanding a 30-percent annual increase." Consequently, 
concerns have been voiced doubting the effectiveness of the 
latest voluntary purchase plans in resolving the bilateral 
automobile trade dispute. 
  However, there are some advantages for Japanese makers of 
fully assembled automobiles to purchase U.S. auto parts. Among 
crucial parts, for example, antilock braking systems (ABS) "made 
in the United States are 80 percent less expensive than those 
made in Japan" (as stated by a Toyota Motor Corporation 
official). 
  On the backdrop of the yen's appreciation against the dollar 
and the recovery of U.S. auto parts manufacturers, Japanese 
automaker officials recently confessed that "if we really wanted 
to, there are many U.S. auto parts that we could buy." 
  The problem, however, is that automobile exports -- which 
have been the mainstay of the Japanese automobile industry -- 
are continuing to drop. Due to declining exports, the domestic 
production of automobiles by the Honda Motor Company, Ltd. is 
expected to drop from 1.2 million units in 1992 to around 1.06 
million units in 1994. 
  Because the outlook is also uncertain for domestic 
automobile 
sales, automakers find it difficult to boldly announce plans to 
import more auto parts. While maintaining that "there may be 
adjustments in automobile production" (as stated by a Mazda 
Motor Corporation official), automakers express strong concerns 
that their voluntary target figures may assume lives of their 
own and become commitments. 
  Meanwhile, it is expected that the United States will now 
ask 
Japan to sell more fully assembled U.S. automobiles in its 
markets rather than U.S. auto parts because this would lead to a 
more direct increase in profits.

  [Text] An ASAHI SHIMBUN opinion poll which surveyed 100 
major companies has revealed that most business executives 
regarded the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. summit on the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks as "unavoidable." 
Meanwhile, concerning the voluntary market-opening package 
aimed at cutting the trade surplus which the government will 
formulate within this month, most executives noted a need to 
formulate concrete measures to ease regulations and expand 
domestic demand, including tax cuts and increased public 
investment. 
  In reply to a question on the Japan-U.S. summit breakdown, 
executives of 67 companies stated, "It was regrettable, but for 
the sake of building new bilateral relations it could not have 
been avoided." Only three answered, "It was only natural 
because the U.S. demand was unreasonable." In the meanwhile, 
only four executives answered that "Japan should have 
compromised." 
  What is noteworthy is that as many as 26 executives gave 
other answers, and most of them pointed out that the government 
had failed to make sufficient efforts to establish a "mature 
relationship." For example, several chemical company executives 
said, "What the government should have done was not only to 
reject U.S. demands but also to present alternative plans for 
cutting the trade surplus while taking the other side's position 
into consideration." 
  The results of the poll have revealed companies' strong 
hopes 
for the market-opening package now being formulated by the 
government. A financial company's executive said, "It is 
desirable that the government indicate definite measures to cut 
the trade surplus." Executives of 81 companies requested that 
"demand be expanded by taking such microeconomic measures as tax 
cuts and increased public investment." Also, executives from 71 
companies called on the government to include in the package 
"concrete goals to achieve deregulation and to correct the gap 
in prices between goods at home and abroad."

  [Text] Speaking at a news conference on 30 March, 
Governor's Office Director Takayama disclosed that Governor Ota 
plans to call on U.S. Ambassador to Japan Mondale, who is 
scheduled to visit Okinawa on 10 April, to settle three serious 
problems resulting from the existence of U.S. military bases on 
Okianawa which are: 1) return of Naha Port; 2) return of the 
Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield and the abolishment of parachute 
training; and 3) cancellation and abolishment of live-fire 
exercises across prefectural Highway 104. Ambassador Mondale is 
scheduled to pay a courtesy call on Governor Ota on 10 April. 
After receiving his courtesy visit, Governor Ota plans to 
petition him for the solution of those issues. 
  Director Takayama said: "The Okinawa Prefectural Office 
heartily welcomes Ambassador Mondale's visit. In fact, we would 
like to arrange a meeting with him aside from his courtesy call. 
However, since his itinerary is crammed, we want to call on him 
to solve the issues immediately after receiving his courtesy 
visit."

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] and the Ministry of Construction decided to set new JIS 
(Japan Industrial Standards) for high-quality steel products for 
construction use from June this year, and to instruct the steel 
and construction industries to use these steel products. 
  This decision was made in view of reported cases of welded 
parts of construction-use steel breaking, which have become a 
social problem. A new set of JIS will be designated 
specifically for steel products for construction use--standards 
used to be uniform for all steel products used in the 
automobile, construction, and other industries. 
  Nippon Steel Corporation and other steel manufacturers will 
start making products under the new JIS, and shipment of such 
products will start toward the end of 1994. 
  As a result of this decision, foreign steelmakers will have 
to obtain certification under the new stricter JIS in their 
attempts to enter the Japanese market for construction materials 
used in public work projects. This may give rise to the 
criticism that the new JIS constitute a nontariff barrier. 
  The introduction of the new JIS was a result of the incident 
in 1991 where JIS-certified steel sheets sold in the domestic 
market broke at the welded portions, and the involved 
manufacturers were penalized. The main point of the new 
standards is that by reducing the sulfur and phosphorus content 
in steel products, faulty welding and inadequate strength can be 
prevented. In terms of product shapes, maximum permissible size 
differences will be reduced to increase precision in welding. 
The new JIS will apply to steel sheets, shape steel, flat steel 
and other products used as construction materials. 
  Along with the MITI's setting of new JIS in June, the 
Construction Ministry will amend its guidelines based on the 
Construction Standards Law, and issue directives encouraging the 
use of new JIS products. 
  However, the depression in demand for steel products has 
caused an increase in the inventory of products certified under 
the old JIS. To prevent confusion in the market due to a sudden 
switch over, the old standards will still be retained beyond 
June. A transition period of one to two years will be set, 
after which old JIS only for steel for construction use will be 
abolished. 
  Regarding the purpose of its efforts to popularize the new 
JIS, the Construction Ministry says, "This is to improve the 
safety of architectural structures in response to demands from 
the related industries and the people" (according to the 
Building Guidance Division). 
  Since new JIS products will require the meticulous removal 
of 
impurities, and other additional procedures in the production 
process, "production cost will be about 10 percent higher than 
existing products" (according to Tokyo Steel Manufacturing 
Company, Ltd.). The current market price for H-shape steel is 
from 30,000 to 40,000 yen per ton. A price increase is being 
considered for the new JIS products. 
  On the other hand, it is believed that foreign companies 
selling steel products used in construction and public work 
projects will also require the new JIS certification. Many 
industry sources think that this will make foreign participation 
even more difficult.

  [Text] The results of a survey on current economic 
conditions which ASAHI SHIMBUN conducted by interviewing top 
executives at 100 major firms (52 firms in the manufacturing 
industry and 48 firms in the services sector) throughout the 
nation indicate the slumping domestic economy is clearly 
bottoming out. 
  Regarding short-term economic forecasts, views were divided 
among the executives, with 50 of them saying they feel the 
economy is either "recovering gradually," "firming down," or 
"close to hitting the bottom," and the other 50 saying they feel 
the economy "remains at the bottom." However, while the 
previous survey (conducted in November 1993) showed that 
one-third of the executives felt the economy was "worsening," 
this time there were none. 
  As to when the economy would move toward recovery, 56 
executives said they feel this will happen between October to 
December this year, indicating they hold high hopes the economy 
would begin recovering by the end of the year. 
  Increased consumer spending and housing investments were 
cited as major reasons the executives feel the slumping economy 
is bottoming out. On the other hand, the yen's further 
appreciation against other currencies and more layoffs were 
concerns cited by many executives. Notable was the fact that 
the number of executives who stressed "political instability" as 
a source of concern jumped from five in the previous survey to 
33 in the latest survey. Since economic prospects still remain 
uncertain, most executives said they feel the government should 
take further action, recommending that income tax cuts be 
continued after fiscal year 1994 and further deregulation be 
promoted. 
  ASAHI SHIMBUN conducted its survey from 14 to 25 March by 
holding personal interviews with top executives, as a rule. 
  Regarding the current state of the economy, two of the 
executives said the economy is "beginning to expand." 
Thirty-one said it is "firming down," while 17 said it is 
"close to hitting the bottom." In the previous survey, none said 
the economy was "firming down" or "close to hitting the bottom." 
  If we look at the manufacturing industry and the services 
sector separately, the results of the survey show that 19 
executives from the services sector said they feel the economy 
is "firming down." In contrast, 30 executives from the 
manufacturing industry said they feel the economy "remains at 
the bottom." These results were in line with the fact that many 
executives from the services sector cited increased consumer 
spending as a positive economic factor, while many from the 
manufacturing industry cited little growth in investment in 
plant and equipment as a negative factor. It can thus be said 
that the manufacturing industry, which by itself has experienced 
the effects of diminished investment in plant and equipment, has 
given a less-than-optimistic view about current economic 
conditions. 
  In the previous survey, predictions as to when the economy 
would start recovering were evenly divided among those 
executives who predicted recovery between July and September 
1994, those between October and December 1994, and those who 
predicted recovery after 1995. This time, however, 56 of the 
executives predicted economic recovery between October and 
December this year. There were 27 executives who predicted the 
economy would not recover until next year, but they were mostly 
from retail merchandising, transportation, steel, and chemical 
firms. 
  Executives predicted real economic growth would remain low 
for fiscal year 1994. Fifty-seven of them said the economy will 
grow in real terms by 0.5 percent to 1.0 percent, and 24 said it 
will grow by less than 0.5 percent, while none predicted growth 
over 2 percent. This indicates there is a wide gap between the 
executives' predictions and the government's prediction of 2.4 
percent growth in gross domestic product (GDP). 
  Regarding areas where they want the government to step up 
its 
efforts, the executives said they hope for continued income and 
residence tax cuts and increased spending on public works 
projects. Notable, however, were some executives saying that 
"effects of increased spending on public works projects, which 
has been the mainstay of the government's traditional 
pump-priming measures, have become diluted." 
  Asked about steps government should now take, 82 of the 
executives said they want tax cuts to be continued in fiscal 
year 1995. Forty-eight of them cited "vigorous promotion of 
deregulation," indicating they hold high expectations for 
renewed vitality in the private sector through the 
implementation of structural economic reforms.

  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is perplexed by the 
intensified discord between the coalition parties over moves 
toward an intercoalition floor group and a coalition merger. 
His proposal for an interparty policy study group triggered a 
controversy over a coalition merger, and Hosokawa is showing 
irritation with such frictions between the coalition parties. 
Earlier this week, Hosokawa started to refuse to answer 
reporters' questions about the policy study group or the 
coalition merger, saying: "I have to work on my duties as prime 
minister. You must not talk about the floor group unification. 
No more question on this issue, please." On 29 March, Hosokawa 
closeted himself in his office for about six hours "to study 
something." This made his associates wonder "what is wrong with 
the prime minister?" 
  Hosokawa's close associates said that he is "really sick and 
tired" of the controversy over the coalition merger. When 
Hosokawa visited Kanazawa to help campaign in the Ishikawa 
gubernatorial election, he told reporters: "I am not going to 
talk about a political realignment anymore because my remarks 
always produce unexpected reactions. I should devote myself to 
my duties as prime minister." However, he added that "I think 
the coalition parties' participation in the policy study group 
will accelerate the adjustment of candidates in the lower house 
elections under the new electoral system." As the result, 
speculation on a coalition merger became further heated. 
  As for the political realignment issue, Hosokawa was saying 
"I do not know" or "no comment" until last week, but he has 
"refused to answer any questions" on the issue since 28 March. 
In response to a report that "an agreement has already been 
reached to form a new party led by Hosokawa and Ichiro Ozawa," 
Hosokawa candidly expressed his displeasure, saying: "I have 
never heard of it. It is really a nuisance." 
  Hosokawa's irritation has been worsened by a delay in Diet 
deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget because this has been 
caused by his own suspicious loans from the Sagawa Kyubin 
Company. On 29 March, he closeted himself in his office after a 
meeting with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata at around 1000. 
Except for 50 minutes for lunch in the dining room, he spent 
all day alone until shortly before 1700. When Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura called on Hosokawa that evening, 
Hosokawa refused to see him, saying "please let me finish my 
studies if you do not have some urgent business." 
  In explaining the "six hours of silence," Hosokawa's close 
associate said: "The prime minister had to study for the 30 
March session of the lower house Budget Committee. In 
preparation for questions from the Liberal Democratic Party, he 
thoroughly reviewed the Sagawa issue." However, it appears that 
Hosokawa is much too stressed out by the internal discord in the 
coalition and the Sagawa scandal.

  [Text] Executives of the Japan New Party [JNP] and the 
Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] met at a Tokyo restaurant on 
the evening of 29 March. During the meeting, both sides agreed 
that "the JNP, the DSP and Sakigake [Harbinger] share the same 
political beliefs and policies," and they proposed that as a 
first step toward realigning the current political parties "the 
three ruling parties form a unified parliamentary group in the 
House of Representatives." 
  The JNP and the DSP are trying to play a mediatory role 
between the ruling coalition parties and to look for a way to 
rally the ruling coalition parties to field their unified 
candidates in the next general election at a time when Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party], Komeito, and the Social Democratic Party 
of Japan are increasingly feuding over a plan for a policy 
research council. 
  Present at the meeting were five legislators from the JNP, 
including Secretary General Masuo Matsuoka, and five legislators 
from the DSP, including Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa.

<F P=106> [Interview with Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa by </F>
unidentified AERA staff member; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [AERA] Why is Komeito aiming to form a "new new 
party," which means that the political world is to be divided 
into "two large groups"? 
  [Ichikawa] The fundamental objective of political reform was 
to create a political situation taht makes it possible to change 
the political regime in order to eliminate political corruption. 
The greatest characteristic of the new election system, 
particularly the characteristic of the single-member districts 
which now number 300, lies in the people being entitled to 
choose who assumes power. If there are three or four major 
groups from the beginning, it becomes impossible for us to judge 
who is to assume the power until we see the results of the 
election. It is undesirable to skeletonize the merit of the new 
system from the start. 
  It seems natural that the two-major-group structure is to be 
formed by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and another group 
to replace the LDP. 
  [AERA] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General 
Ichiro Ozawa is planning to take a "two-step strategy"--to first 
unite the conservative groups, such as the Japan New Party [JNP] 
and others, into a parent body, and then request both Komeito 
and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] join their group. What 
is your opinion on this? 
  [Ichikawa] Komeito has been consistently proposing that, 
based on the present structure of the coalition parties, a 
moderate coalition should be formed where each party's 
philosophy is respected. It is a form which may be called "a 
`furoshiki [cloth wrapper]-type' new new party." Shinseito's 
move is acceptable if we take the move as a step towards forming 
a new new party. 
  [AERA] Is there any opposition among party members and 
supporters about the name "Komeito" disappearing? 
  [Ichikawa] It it true that there is an emotional resistance, 
particularly among middle-aged members. I myself regret the 
fact. However, Komeito has been promoting political reform 
supported by its unselfish desire to change the politics of 
Japan. I believe we should also do our best in the future to 
overcome our mental conflicts. 
  However, when I consider the feelings of local assembly 
members and supporters, I feel it necessary to find a 
satisfactory way to shift our party to the "new new party." 
  [AERA] Many people think that, in view of the religious 
allergy to Komeito, there is little possibility of those Komeito 
Diet members who are already serving being appointed as unified 
candidates. 
  [Ichikawa] Though in the future it is not desirable for each 
party to select its own candidate independently during the 
process of selecting unified candidates, a consensus based on 
common sense is being formed among the coalition parties to the 
effect that priority is to be given to the Diet members in who 
are already serving. Therefore, I do not think the number of 
Komeito's Diet members in who are already serving, which is 
presently 52, is likely to decrease. 
  [AERA] At the present stage, when do you think the election 
will take place? 
  [Ichikawa] In my opinion, the election will take place after 
the autumn of next year following the House of Councillors 
election next summer. Personally, I feel it appropriate if the 
general election takes place at a later date in 1996. 
  [AERA] Then when will the "new new party" be formed? 
  [Ichikawa] It is hard to tell unless the time of the general 
election is made known to us. 
  We have to see the progress of adjustment in selecting 
candidates in single-seat districts. It is also necessary for 
us to ascertain whether the "social democratic and liberal" 
group aims at becoming an axis of the political regime, or if 
the group is to remain one of the competitive axes within the 
coalition parties.... I think we should not be too hasty in 
forming a new new party as it might cause the coalition parties 
to split.

<F P=106> [Article by Akira Washio, political commentator: "Hosokawa's </F>
Agony"] 
  [Text] Every now and then a person seems to have 
premonitions. 
  The reason that Morihiro Hosokawa met two figures from whom 
he had become somewhat distant after he won government power was 
probably not because he foresaw a situation verging on the brink 
of failure, but because of a feeling of uneasiness. 
  It was late in the year [1993] when Hosokawa humbly invited 
Noboru Takeshita, who resigned from the LDP [Liberal Democratic 
Party] after being questioned about his relationship with 
Kominto [right-wing group] and appeared to be shut out from 
Nagata-cho [prime minister's official residence]. In an attempt 
to escape from the one-man axis of Ichiro Ozawa (secretary 
general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]), is it eventually 
this man that enters everyone's mind? 
  [Hosokawa] The reason that I have met with you today is 
because the Ministry of Finance [MOF] is strongly against 
separating tax reduction from the consumer tax. At this rate the 
budget cannot be planned. Your assistance will be appreciated. 
  [Takeshita]It is quite difficult. The MOF wants a clause 
inserted stipulating that the deficit will be made up by the 
consumer tax regardless of how many years later it is. However, 
I will try to talk to them. 
  [Hosokawa]I would also like to ask your advice regarding 
economic stimulus measures. 
  [Takeshita]Naito has submitted his resignation, so nothing 
can be done about it; but I cannot approve of others doing the 
same thing. 
  Hosokawa persevered with the SDPJ [Social Democratic Party 
of 
Japan], which tended to dissociate itself from the 
administration concerning political reform and the rice market 
under the cause of "preserving the coalition." However, with the 
final stretch of political reform and the planning of the next 
fiscal budget overlapped, he is faced with the gravest crisis 
since the advent of his administration. 
  The reason is that, even if bold steps are taken to reduce 
tax for business recovery, when he makes his intention clear to 
raise the consumer tax as a source of tax reduction, they might 
really drop out of the coalition. There is a saying that "there 
are limits to one's endurance" (the SDPJ left-wing faction). 
  The separation between tax reduction and the consumer tax is 
based on advice by Kiichi Miyazawa at a meeting in Karuizawa 
last summer. However, aside from Miyazawa who is a financial 
expert, the MOF, which advocates sound finance, would not agree 
with Hosokawa regardless of his efforts. It would not give an 
inch even if Hosokawa, Chairman Tsutomu Hata of Shinseito 
(deputy prime minister and foreign minister), and Chairman 
Koshiro Ishida of Komeito (director of the Managenement and 
Coordination Agency) all acted in unison. 
  If so, whatever Ichiro Ozawa may think, there is no 
alternative except to depend on Takeshita who has practical 
clout with the MOF. 
  Takeshita criticized the firing of Masahisa Naito, director 
of the Industrial Policy Bureau of the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry [MITI], for favoritism concerning personnel 
changes, and he casually warned: "It will not do to continue 
such firings." 
  Although the truth cannot be verified, it is rumored that 
Kyosuke Shinozawa, director of the Budget Bureau of the MOF, and 
Hisakazu Kuriyama, ambassador to the United States, could become 
the second and third "Naitos." 
  Ozawa may be displeased if it were said that everything is 
based on Ozawa's suggestions, but the LDP's view is that it is 
not unrelated to Ichiro Ozawa's concept of "controlling the 
bureaucracy" to suppress the bureaucracy by broadly introducing 
a "political appointment system" for the positions of vice 
ministers and parliamentary councillors. 
  The former Soviet Communist Party used to deploy its party 
cadres to battleships in order to control the powerful "Red 
Army." There is a view that Ozawa may be imitating this strategy. 
  It is said that, unlike Jiro Saito, administrative vice 
minister who is friendly with Ichiro Ozawa, Shinozawa is close 
to Ryutaro Hashimoto, Ozawa's rival. However, Saito and 
Shinozawa have worked as a team for many years in the budget 
field, and there is reason to doubt that they will be targeted. 
  As for Kuriyama, he once angered Ozawa by admonishing him to 
"think like an adult" when the latter strongly advocated 
rearguard support for the multinational forces against Iraq as 
part of Japan's international contribution when Ozawa was LDP 
secretary general. 
  It is a matter of opinion as to whether this fuss is seen as 
incidental or as a link in the subjugation of the bureaucracy. 
It appears at least that public opinion has sided with MITI 
minister Hiroshi Kumagai who fired Naito. 
  "In the United States, a mass change of the bureaucracy 
takes place with a new president."Although unrelated to MITI 
personnel moves, upper house member Sadao Hirano, Ichiro Ozawa's 
confidant, stresses the need to probe into the bureaucracy which 
has become rigid following political reform. 
  However, Takeshita cites the bygone struggle between the 
"Seiyukai" [Constitutional Party of Political Friends] and 
"Minseito" [Constitutional Democratic Party] parties which even 
replaced policemen with changes in the administration, thus 
throwing national politics into chaos, and he asks that the 
morale of the bureaucracy not be damaged. 
<H5>  Told To "Cut Takemura" </H5>
  Following this meeting, Hosokawa visited an elderly and 
long-time friend. 
  [Hosokawa] It has been some time since I last saw you." 
  [Friend] You seem to be working very hard. 
  [Hosokawa] At the end of last year [1993], Ichiro Ozawa whom 
you know came alone to see me and strongly demanded: "Are you 
going to choose me or choose Takemura?" His point was: "Cut 
Takemure, or I will not cooperate." I believe that is why Ozawa 
announced his decision to take a leave of absence." 
  The elderly friend facing Hosokawa was Yoshitaka Yotsumoto, 
president of Sanko Construction Industry. 
  He once held a Zen session with Yasuhiro Nakasone, who was 
the prime minister like Hosokawa, and taught him how to control 
his mind as a person engaged in politics. 
  After becoming involved in the Ketsumeidan [Blood 
Brotherhood 
Society] incident, he became friends with Kantaro Suzuki, the 
prime minister toward the end of the war. He was also secretary 
to Fumimaro Konoye, Hosokawa's grandfather, and talked with 
Konoye at his villa in Mt. Hakone immediately prior to the 
latter's suicide. 
  After the war, aside from Kakuei Tanaka, he was spiritual 
adviser to numerous prime ministers including Shigeru Yoshida. 
Noboru Takeshita followed Nakasone in seeking his advice on 
various occasions. 
  It was Hosokawa's first assignment as a reporter for the 
ASAHI SHIMBUN in Kagoshima Prefecture when he met Yotsumoto and 
became devoted to him, praising him as "the most respectable 
person I know." 
<H5>  Encouragement From Yoshitaka Yotsumoto </H5>
  "That is nothing." 
  Yotsumoto talked about the past: 
  "During the Kishi cabinet, Bamboku Ono who 
greatly disliked Eisaku Sato, Nobusuke Kishi's younger brother, 
demanded that Kishi `cut Eisaku Sato.' 
  "In those days, Kishi was weak-kneed and 
promised anything to save his administration. I joined with 
Ryugo Hashimoto, Ryutaro Hashimoto's father and a great man, to 
scold and encourage Kishi to `absolutely not cut Sato.' 
  "An interesting episode is written in 
Bamboku Ono's Memoirs. 
  Ono removed Hirokichi Nadao as the minister 
of posts and telecommunications in the fifth Yoshida cabinet and 
appointed Juichiro Tsukada, his follower, to the post. 
  "However, there are a lot of shrewd people in 
this world. A man phoned Tsukada to tell him triumphantly: `I 
recommended you for minister and it was successful.' I hate to 
mention the name of the caller, but his name is was Eisaku Sato. 
  "Speaking of Sato, I recall cooperating with 
Ichiro Kono to give another chance as justice minister to Ken 
Inukai, who had spoiled his chance as the justice minister due 
to his use of authority in connection with the shipbuilding 
scandals. However, the prime minister absolutely refused. I 
learned later that it was strongly opposed by Sato whose own 
political life was spared due also to the exercise of authority." 
  It is an episode that illustrates the bad relations between 
Ono and Sato. 
  After relating the above, Yotsumoto encouraged Hosokawa, 
saying: "That is that. There is nothing for to you to fear. You 
must do what you think is right." 
  Yotsumoto has always contended that a leader must make 
decisions without consulting anyone. "If you act according to 
what someone tells you, the person who tells you will become the 
leader." 
  He is telling Hosokawa, who is at an impasse concerning 
political reform and shows signs of desperation: "If you move 
ahead prepared for cabinet dissolution and a general election, 
it is the LDP that will suffer. In other words, a breakthrough 
can be made by grappling with the problem through conviction. 
<H5>  One Cannot Cross a Bridge Without Taking Risks </H5>
  Yotsumoto acts swiftly. After the meeting with Hosokawa, he 
immediately called Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, 
with whom he is on intimate terms. 
  Yotsumoto, who thinks that Takemura will someday become 
prime 
minister, quoted his friend Eizaburo Nishibori, commander of the 
first Antarctic winter expedition, who said: "A bridge cannot be 
crossed by avoiding risks," counseled Takemura as follows: 
"Hosokawa has crossed a bridge by not being cautious. Your job 
is to be extremely cautious and supportive. In doing so, 
relations between the two of you will never go sour. 
  The coalition is sustained by the heads of the seven parties 
and factions joining hands, and the administration could be 
dismantled by a single defector. 
  Despite such a fragile administration, it seems rash to 
demand that a choice be made between the options of choosing or 
not choosing Ichiro Ozawa. However, from the standpoint of a 
strategy of unifying the coalition into a single party and 
demoting the LDP from a "mammoth party" to an "ordinary party," 
the fight with Masayoshi Takemura who, given the opportunity, 
wishes to revive an administration centered on the LDP by 
joining with the LDP reform faction, transcends a mere struggle 
over leadership and is a struggle over direction itself. That 
is why "Masayoshi Takemura is said to have replaced Nakasone as 
Ichiro Ozawa's real enemy." 
  The lack of a clear perspective concerning the political 
reform bill overlapped with this confrontation that pressures 
have swiftly built for dissolution. Hosokawa himself is 
reportedly prepared to use his trump card as a last resort and 
to be the toughest hardliner. 
<H5>  Shinseito's Declaration for Dissolution </H5>
  Within the Shinseito, Moriyoshi Sato called the younger 
members together and declared: "Dissolution will surely come. 
Mr. Kanemaru also says so." 
  Borrowing Kanemaru's words is typical of Sato who was 
Kanemaru's close associate. Shin Kanemaru, former LDP deputy 
prime minister who was indicted on suspicion of violating the 
income tax law (tax evasion), moved from Azabu, Tokyo, to his 
home district of Shirane-cho in Yamanashi Prefecture; however, 
Sato visits Kanemaru from time to time to comfort him. 
  Sato emphasizes that, if political reform is crushed, public 
criticism will focus on the LDP and it will inevitably suffer 
defeat. 
  Like being alarmed by the flapping wings of waterfowl, its 
members will waver and scramble to abandon the LDP. The party 
may split even further. 
  The "sleeping lion" called the "considered rejection" in 
Article 59, paragraph 4 of the Constitution suddenly arose and 
loomed menacingly. 
  The gist is as follows: If the upper house receives a bill 
but does not offer a decision within 60 days, the lower house 
"will consider it to be rejected by the upper house," and if the 
lower house reapproves it by a special two-thirds majority, it 
can enact the bill. The aim of the legislation is to prevent 
sabotage by the upper house. 
  If the stipulation is invoked, the upper house would be 
powerless. The aim is not to invoke the stipulation, but to 
offer the LDP an opportunity to realize political reform and to 
try to force it to take a "loyalty test." 
  It probably implies that "If you agree with political 
reform, 
prove it by your action." Therefore, if it opposes it, it must 
clarify its stand before the people and move toward dissolution. 
This will be painful. The reason the upper house can openly call 
for political reform is simply that the upper house does not 
have to worry about dissolution. 
  However, former Defense Agency Director General Keisuke 
Nakanishi who attended the meeting rebutted: "Despite what is 
said, can you really win?" 
  It may sound plausible to say that a solution will be 
reached 
through dissolution and a general election, but it is not 
certain whether victory or defeat will result from a general 
election. From Nakanishi's viewpoint, holding a general election 
based on the current medium-size constituency system would 
merely play into the hands of the LDP. 
  Providing the backdrop for the threat to push dissolution 
and 
a general election is the high rate of support for the Hosokawa 
cabinet. A shadow has begun to appear in the support for the 
cabinet. 
  A blade with a sharp cutting edge could end up cutting the 
holder if things go wrong. 
  One source of apprehension is that the empirical rule 
concerning elections called the "pendulum principle" may come 
into play. 
  If a sense of disappointment grows that, although it caused 
the LDP an overwhelming defeat, the Hosokawa cabinet itself has 
done nothing to boast of, the votes could revert to the LDP. 
<H5>  Runner-Up's Resilience </H5>
  Another point is the "resilience of the runnerup." The LDP 
had as many as 36 runners-up in the general election in July 
1993. Beware of these "second-place candidates." 
  In the 1990 general election, 45 of the 73 candidates who 
were in second place in the previous general election garnered 
wins (61.6 percent). In the LDP, 23 of the 31 previous 
runners-up (74.2 percent) were elected. 
  A simple comparison cannot be made because of replacements 
among LDP members. However, according to this theory, at least 
20 or more comebacks will be possible if a general election is 
held on a medium-constituency basis. 
  The LDP currently holds 222 seats, which is 34 short of a 
majority (256 seats). Therefore, it cannot achieve a majority 
unless all of the previous runners-up win. 
  Consequently, while it will not be easy for the LDP to 
regain 
ruling power, the presence of Sakigake must not be forgotten. 
Rather than Sakigake itself, it is the presence of its leader, 
Masayoshi Takemura, who is competing against Ichiro Ozawa. 
  Assuming that the LDP succeeds in gaining a total that is 10 
seats short of a majority, the choice by Sakigake (12 seats) can 
be decisive. 
  Although it is said that Sakigake will not be so foolish as 
to assist the LDP's restoration to power, if the Sakigake should 
entice the LDP by making a drastic request concerning political 
reform and economic reform, a coalition between the LDP and 
Sakigake cannot be ruled out. At this point, the LDP will 
probably accept anything. It will be much more expedient than 
tottering toward reform. 
  Nonetheless, it is unlikely that Ichiro Ozawa would stand by 
idly. In fact, he is said to have already made advances to 
Sakigake and to have tried to persuade a number of members, 
except Takemura, to come to Shinseito. That is probably why he 
requested "Takemura's transfer." 
  On Yotsumoto's advice, Takemura visited Ozawa early on the 
morning of New Year's Day, bowed his head, and sought to heal 
their differences. He was probably determined to endure in order 
to reverse his fortunes in the future. 
<H5>  Kono With No Trump Cards </H5>
  On 6 January 1994, LDP President Yohei Kono et al gathered 
at 
the LDP headquarters for a New Year's party. 
  Kono spotted Takushi Hirai, chairman of the joint houses 
general council and head of the upper house, and told him: "The 
rest is up to the upper house. I hope you will do your best." 
  Kono probably intended it to be a New Year's greeting. 
However, Hirai did not interpret it that way. 
  "President, you asked me to do my best, but how and 
concerning what am I to do my best? Please give me some 
direction. Are you saying that I should crush political reform 
at this stage, or what do you ask me to amend? I cannot do 
anything unless I have some direction." 
  At this rebuttal, Kono remained silent. 
  However, the situation changed abruptly. 
  The SDPJ, the Achilles' heel of the coalition, has finally 
exposed its weakness. The recent split in the SDPJ appears to be 
virtually irreparable. The future of political reform has 
suddenly become murky. 
  Across-the-board resignations or dissolution of the lower 
house? 
  Regardless of the twists and turns, the ultimate result will 
inevitably be one or the other. Political reform can only be 
postponed for the time being. However, everyone knows that the 
public is not so naive as to let it pass unheeded. Already 
"political reform" in another sense with "political 
restructuring" in mind is on the rise.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hisahiko Okazaki, former Japanese Ambassador </F>
to Thailand, by unidentified GAIKO FORUM reporter on 6 December 
1993; place not given] 
  [Text] The Situation Cannot Be Grasped When Thinking 
About Unnecessary Things 
  [GAIKO FORUM] The Gulf war is the recent case in which the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs' assessment of the state of affairs 
was regarded as bad. Japan's Foreign Ministry was greatly 
criticized for that. What do you think about it? 
  [Okazaki] Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990. I was the 
Japanese Ambassador to Thailand then. On that date, Foreign 
Minister Taro Nakayama had stopped over in Bangkok for a night 
on his return trip after attending an ASEAN meeting. 
  As I was listening to a news program, I learned that Iraq 
was 
likely to invade Kuwait. The reason was because, for one thing, 
there was information that Iraq was amassing its troops along 
the border. Since it is difficult to supply needs when you come 
to the forefront in a desert, assembling at the border means 
that the troops are on the offensive. For another, what Iraq 
had been demanding from Kuwait was far from acceptable to it. 
  That night Mr. Nakayama and I had dinner with the foreign 
minister of Thailand. If Washington had known about the 
possibility of war, there was a possibility that it would have 
already discusses it only with the top leaders of the world. So 
I briefed Mr. Nakayama on the subject, just in case, but it was 
not brought up during the dinner. Later we learned that the 
United States had not imagined that the war would break out. 
So, Thailand did not know about it as a matter of course. 
  When Mr. Nakayama returned to Bangkok after the incident had 
occurred while he had been staying for a night in Laos, he 
immediately came to my residence, (the official residence of the 
ambassador) and asked my opinion. I said at that time, the 
point was, first, to what extent Saudi Arabia would cooperate 
[with the United States], and whether Egypt was going to support 
[the United States]. If Saudi Arabia and Egypt supported the 
United States, it would be all right. Also, [we thought] the 
first thing the United States would do was to block Iraqi 
economy, and it was better for Japan to join the United States 
immediately. In fact, Japan supported imposing economic 
sanctions at once, and that was before the UN resolution on 
sanctions. Up to that point, I was very satisfied with Japan's 
judgment and actions. However, they were not good thereafter. 
What happened after that is as you know. Stubbornly adhering to 
the postwar pacifism without regard to its practicality, 
Japanese assessments and policies were terrible. I was in Japan 
from the beginning to the end of September on annual leave. 
Japan's views on the situation while I was there were so 
terrible. I learned how bad the Japanese are in assessing the 
situation. 
  The president of a top leading company asked me what would 
happen next. And I answered that the United States would of 
course intervene and a war would break out. Then he said, "the 
dispute should be solved by peaceful means." Also, a prime 
minister-level politician said, "If there is going to be a war, 
oil prices will skyrocket, and [the economy] will get mixed up. 
War should be avoided because the world economy will be thrown 
into great disorder." I thought this opinion was wrong in terms 
of not only its economic outlook but also its view in which war 
could not be started because oil prices would increase. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] You mean economics is not the only thing that 
influences human society. 
  [Okazaki] While I was paying attention to the U.S.-Saudi 
Arabia negotiations, they ended in almost no time, and on 9 
August a formation of F-15's arrived in Saudi Arabia from 
Germany. This meant that oil was all right because the 300 km 
stretch from Kuwait to Saudi Arabia's oil fields is a desert 
without trees, grass, or even clouds. You cannot do anything 
unless you have air supremacy. Therefore, the moment the U.S. 
fighters arrived in Saudi Arabia the safety of large oil fields 
in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, whose supply is enough to meet 
the world's demand, was assured. I said this to the politician. 
I also told him not to worry. Oil prices may rise for the 
first week after a war starts, but they will drop steeply 
afterwards. The politician did not want to think that oil 
prices would not surge. That was why everybody made a wrong 
judgment. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] That is a question [of prerequisite] before 
discussing information itself. 
  [Okazaki] In September, I met many people, including 
Kissinger, who was visiting Japan, and a rough outlook of the 
situation became apparent. I returned to Bangkok late in 
September. From then on, there was no information. 
  So I made a decision. There is a British division called the 
"Desert Rats." It is a glorious division which fought Erwin 
Rommel at the Libyan front. In short, it is England's most 
powerful division. This division was heading for the Gulf from 
the riverside of the Rhine. In Bangkok, I decided to 
occasionally ask the British ambassador to Thailand where the 
Desert Rat division was. So I got such information as the 
division was in the Mediterranean Sea, it had landed, or it was 
under training. 
  The United States would not start a war alone. So, when the 
deployment of the British division was completed and it was 
ready to fight, it meant the beginning of war. The deployment 
was completed in late November. 
  The last notification was issued at the United Nations on 
30 November. The notification period was originally one month, 
but this was extended to 45 days after the Soviet Union asked 
for an extra 15 days. The war then began in mid-January. So, 
my prediction was correct. If you look at the world as it is, 
you can get the answers. If you do not grasp the situation, you 
must be considering something irrelevant. In other words, you 
start to understand the world once you stop thinking about 
unnecessary things. 
<H5>  The Collapse of Eastern Europe Predicted a Year Earlier </H5>
  [GAIKO FORUM] Besides the Gulf war, did you find the 
collapse of Eastern Europe impressive? 
  [Okazaki] When the Berlin Wall fell, every newspaper 
described it as "a situation no one would ever have imagined." 
Thanks to those who started the talk, I do not know who, no one 
can be blamed for not predicting the event. 
  The fall of Eastern Europe, however, was a clear possibility 
about a year earlier. I met a great many people in 1988. Each 
of them, including Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski, said 
Eastern Europe was in trouble. Brzezinski made the best point 
when he said, "the current situation of Eastern Europe is 
similar to that of Europe in 1848." It was in 1848 that 
Metternich fled after revolutions occurred in chain reaction 
across Europe. 
  As I did not know a lot about that period I studied and 
learned that the situation was taking the same course. I 
reported this to senior Foreign Ministry officials. From that 
time Vice Minister Murata repeatedly said Eastern Europe would 
soon be chaotic. 
  In a speech made to presidents of Japanese firms in Bangkok 
at the beginning of 1989, I said there was the possibility of 
the Soviet Union intervening if the situation in Eastern Europe 
erupted. I explained that if the Soviets intervened, it would 
lead to a near state of war. At such a time the value of the 
yen would drop. On the other hand, if there was no 
intervention, and the situation moved in a direction favorable 
to the United States, leading to victory for the West, then the 
value of the dollar would rise. Investment in Southeast Asia is 
very sensitive to the value of the yen. A certain company [in 
Bangkok] told me, "if the yen goes over 180 to the dollar, then 
the head office in Japan will not take care of goods 
manufactured there. They will have to be sold locally." 
Everybody fears a weak yen. At the end of 1989, I told firms 
to beware a weaker yen, and the dollar turned out to be slightly 
stronger thanks to the victory of democracy in Eastern Europe. 
You can even predict these kinds of things. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] I see. Is there anything else? 
  [Okazaki] What is more strange are the discussions 
surrounding the current recession. In February 1993, Fred 
Bergsten [director of the Institute for International Economics] 
came to Japan. He made speeches at various places. He also met 
then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, and they apparently found 
in each other a kindred spirit. What Bergsten said is that the 
issue of Japan's trade imbalance could be settled by an 
appreciation in the yen rate. I think he said that if the value 
of the yen increased by 1 percent, it would bring down Japan's 
trade surplus by $5 billion. It would not happen immediately, 
but in two to three years. A 10-percent increase in the yen's 
value would cut $50 billion, eliminating almost entirely the 
trade surplus with the United States, Bergsten said at various 
different times. I knew the U.S. Government would try to guide 
the value of the yen upward, and the Japanese Government could 
not resist it. Since I am not an expert on economics, I asked 
my friends in the business world what they would do if the yen 
reached the level of 100 to the dollar. Everybody said Japanese 
economic growth would be zero, and the economy would fall into a 
recession comparable to that in Europe. This means everybody 
knew the yen would become stronger, and that the yen's 
appreciation would halt economic growth. That was in February 
and March of 1993. 
  Nevertheless, newspapers and economic forecasts expected a 
recovery in the summer. When, by the summer, it had not 
recovered, they blamed it on the cool summer. I do not think 
the cool summer caused a business slowdown, except perhaps in 
one or two industries. The cause was the strong yen. 
  In short, the government had to encourage industry to carry 
out drastic restructuring while implementing a large-scale 
economic stimulus package in February. But both politicians and 
government officials appeared frozen into inaction. 
<H5>  Strategic Thinking and Secret Funds Enable Positive Diplomacy </H5>
  [GAIKO FORUM] You also believe Japan-U.S. relations will be 
at stake in February. 
  [Okazaki] The United States urged Japan to set numerical 
targets in July 1993, and Japan agreed on condition it be a 
reference index, thus postponing a real settlement of the issue. 
I think such a solution was, at the time, a success because it 
put a stop to the Japan-bashing then taking place. However, in 
February, six months later, the two countries will have to pay 
for putting off a real settlement. 
  The discussion on the Japanese construction market in 
November was handled all right, so the issue now will center on 
whether to set a numerical target for the auto parts market. 
This time Japan will not make concessions because even at last 
July's talks it had no intention of compromising to that extent. 
It agreed to the compromise in word, with no thought of putting 
it into action. 
  However, the U.S. approach has been very demanding and has 
come in for criticism even within the United States. It has 
continually urged Japan not to exercise administrative guidance; 
now it wants Japan to meet targets through the use of 
administrative guidance. This is quite wrong theoretically. 
That is why all economists oppose the idea. 
  But the United States has its reasons. It concentrated on 
promoting deregulation in the past, urging Japan to abolish all 
sorts of regulations. However, the trade imbalance would not go 
away. It thought Japan might be exercising administrative 
guidance out of sight, so the United States thought that if 
Japan was set a target to achieve, it would use its discreet 
administrative guidance to that end. This is very coercive 
reasoning, but there is about 30 percent of truth in the 
suppositions behind it. Many economists, though, disapprove of 
the idea. 
  In addition, the United States has rapidly regained its 
confidence. So now there is a possibility the U.S. Government 
will stop making unreasonable demands on Japan if we can wait 
for another six months. If Japan judges that the grounds on 
which the U.S. argument are based are about to collapse, it will 
never compromise. At such a time the two nations are on a 
collision course. It will be all right if the United States 
softens its stand by February, but, if not, Japan and the United 
States will collide. If there is going to be a head-on 
collision between the two countries, there is the possibility of 
a revival of the Super 301. If the Super 301 is reinstituted, 
the situation will become more problematic. There will be no 
place for negotiation or discretion. This must be avoided or 
there will be disastrous consequences for years to come. 
  At the moment neither side has any intention of making 
concessions. Instead, they are playing "a game of chicken," in 
which two cars run at each other on course for a head-on 
collision, and the one who turns the steering wheel first is the 
"chicken." February will be like that. 
  One way Japan can avoid such a situation is to persuade U.S. 
economists and open-minded legislators one by one, by mobilizing 
many people, including scholars, and anyone else in a position 
of influence. If Japan can relax feelings in the United States 
it may be able to reach a compromise at some point. Such 
diplomacy would succeed now if it could be carried out, but I do 
not think it can be done. 
  Let me explain why. Basically, diplomacy is passive 
administration. In other words, a problem occurs first and then 
diplomacy comes in to solve it. The best example of passive 
administration is policing. You arrest a thief if there is one. 
You do not set a target, for example, to catch 2,000 thieves 
next year because 1,000 were arrested this year. Traditional 
ministries such as foreign and home affairs are passive 
administrations. They do not think it is their job to carry 
swords and make raids on enemies. 
  You may have an ambassador, with the knowledge and eloquence 
of a first-rate economist, who is able to persuade his 
opponents, but that is not always the case. 
  In the past, both the Foreign and Home Affairs Ministries 
had 
the means of positive administration. That is, secret funds. 
Nowadays, there are no such funds. For instance, suppose you 
hire economists, and ask each of them to win at least three 
people over to your side, by giving them 10 million yen each. 
If you use 10 economists, the you will need to pay out 100 
million yen. It is difficult today to freely spend an amount 
like 100 million yen. So, the two countries will be moving fast 
on a collision course before anything serious can be done. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] Is not strategic thinking a positive means? 
  [Okazaki] Yes, it is. And if you had a strategic mind and 
secret funds, you could carry out positive diplomacy. 
<H5>  Developments in the Crisis-Ridden Korean Peninsula </H5>
  [GAIKO FORUM] You have written a book called Tonari no 
kuni de kangaeta koto [My Thoughts on a Neighboring 
Country], and you are familiar with the situation in the 
Korean peninsula. What are the important developments in North 
Korea (the Democratic People's Republic of Korea), that we 
should watch. 
  [Okazaki] Everybody feels in their hearts that the 
government of North Korea will collapse. We do not know whether 
this will happen tomorrow or 10 years from now, but there is 
always the possibility. A more immediate problem is the issue 
of nuclear inspection. By February 1994, the matter will be 
reaching its final stages. 
  The administration of the United States has changed from 
Republican to Democrat. The appointment of the new 
administration's officials was completed around June and July 
1993. Since then, the issue of nuclear inspection has moved 
toward a negotiated settlement. This means, the United States 
will try to stop North Korea's development of nuclear weapons by 
offering a series of concessions to North Korea's liking, such 
as the cancelation of the joint Team Spirit exercise with the 
South. 
  This kind of approach itself has met opposition from the 
conservatives. For one thing, they feel that rewarding North 
Korea for violating the treaty sets a bad example. For another, 
if the negotiations are slow, North Korea's nuclear arms 
development will continue to progress. But despite such 
opposition, the United States is determined to solve the issue 
by diplomatic means. The question is how long this resolution 
will hold. 
  The Democratic administration is dove-like compared to the 
Republicans. It is the Republicans who can conceive of things 
like pinpoint bombing. The Democratic Party, however, is 
characteristically peaceable and believes in principle-oriented 
diplomacy. Principles such as human rights. Among them is the 
principle of not allowing the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction. If the United States permitted North Korea to arm 
itself with nuclear weapons, then it would be forced to allow 
Iraq and Iran the same right. That is the last thing the 
Democrats can allow. In that respect, Democrats do not think in 
terms of power politics. There is no room for the Democratic 
administration to think nuclear armament is inevitable, so why 
not accommodate the country as a new nuclear nation and treat it 
accordingly. Nevertheless, it seems difficult to maintain a 
policy that nuclear armament should never be allowed while 
saying the issue must be settled by diplomacy. As a result, it 
is negotiating with North Korea by offering a lot of 
compromises, but is determined to impose sanctions if talks 
break down. This is U.S. policy. 
  However, South Korea cannot follow it. As a result of the 
fact it has its first civilian government in a long time, there 
were antiestablishment, left-wing liberals in the Seoul 
administration until a recent reshuffle. Because of them, the 
South Korean Government was not able to show determinedly that 
it would not tolerate North Korea pushing things too far. 
However, there is an extreme sense of crisis among the military 
and the conservatives in South Korea because of the 
antiestablishment figures in the administration. Their 
opposition is so strong that the South Korean Government again 
cannot support the U.S. negotiation tactics of offering good 
concessions to North Korea. The South Korean Government was 
unable to announce the suspension of Team Spirit. It may do so 
eventually, but Seoul cannot take any action. 
  The reason why South Korea does not face criticism, even 
though it is doing nothing, is because it keeps saying that 
diplomatic talks are underway. For example, at the meeting 
between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Kim 
Yong-sam, they concluded that diplomatic negotiations would be 
continued. As long as they maintain that line there will be no 
contradiction. Of course, there are contradictions behind the 
scenes. It will be about February when these contradictions 
come to the surface. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] Does the Korean peninsula face a crisis in 
February too? 
  [Okazaki] Here is the reason. There are surveillance 
cameras which constantly monitor North Korea's nuclear 
facilities. However, the cameras are about to run out of film 
and batteries. So the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) 
says they have to be changed soon or the status of North Korea's 
nuclear weapons development cannot be monitored. The IAEA will, 
in the near future, ask the UN Security Council to do something 
about the issue. As circumstances stand at the moment, it is 
currently constrained. Even if North Korea yields and accepts 
inspection of its nuclear sites, the suspicion that North Korea 
is developing nuclear arms will not go away. And there will be 
allegations that North Korea is buying time and that it is 
continuing to develop nuclear weapons. Talk of adopting a 
resolution to impose sanctions will once again emerge unless 
people are prepared tacitly to allow North Korea to develop 
nuclear weapons. It is inevitable. If sanctions are adopted, 
which North Korea has been saying it will take as almost a 
declaration of war, Pyongyang could take any kind of action. 
This is approaching. 
  However, there is also the possibility of the matter coming 
suddenly to a peaceful settlement. The United States is ready 
to make concessions until the issue is solved. The problem will 
be settled when North Korea is satisfied with the deal. There 
is also the possibility that North Korea's nuclear weapons 
development is not nearly as advanced as we thought, and that it 
has been blocked by technological hurdles. This, then, would 
provide a marvelous opportunity for North Korea to strike a 
bargain. So there is a chance the situation could improve very 
quickly. In either case, February 1994 will be the turning 
point. In addition to all this, people also feel the government 
of North Korea could collapse at any time. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] A fearful thought. 
  [Okazaki] North Korea's reaction to economic sanctions, if 
they are imposed, is a fearful thought too. It is especially 
frightening to South Korea and Japan. We do not know what North 
Korea will do. A missile may be fired or, like the Rangoon 
incident, a bomb may be planted somewhere. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] Will China cooperate in imposing sanctions on 
North Korea? 
  [Okazaki] Yes, I think so. If food and oil to North 
Korea are stopped, it cannot exist. However, since China was 
North Korea's ally in the Korean war, it cannot strangle North 
Korea to death by its own hands. China will cooperate in 
enforcing sanctions to a certain degree, but it will not be 
possible to rely on that to ruin North Korea. North Korea would 
be destroyed if China seriously imposed effective sanctions. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] The issue of Hong Kong's democratization is 
now being given a great deal of attention. 
  [Okazaki] The return of Hong Kong to China will be in 1997. 
There are four more years. Before then the issue of Deng 
Xiaoping's successor will emerge. Also, we do not know what 
Taiwan and Tibet will do. Taiwan has already applied to join 
the United Nations, and that is virtually a declaration of 
independence. Moreover, the outside world will start to realize 
that Taiwan has become a free democratic country. When Taiwan 
is recognized as a democratic nation, the United States will not 
be able to neglect it. As it becomes clear the Taiwanese are 
taking a different course from Mainland China, people in Hong 
Kong will envy them. This issue will come up around 1995. 
<H5>  Comparing 19th Century Europe With Asia </H5>
  [GAIKO FORUM] Lastly, let's take up the issue of historical 
vision, which you have been stressing. What do you think is the 
most important thing as we look toward the 21st century? 
  [Okazaki] I wrote an article for a magazine about the 
similarities between 19th century Europe and Asia at the moment. 
  After the Napoleonic war, ethnic nations emerged all at 
once. 
These countries had been in chaos in the 30 or so years from the 
Napoleonic war to the revolution of 1848, but all of them 
suddenly started to grow economically from about 1848. 
  In Asia today, China, for example, became independent around 
1950, and it was about the time of the Gang of Four in 1978 that 
its economic growth started. Other Asian nations also declared 
their independence about 1950, and their growth began from about 
the time of the Plaza Accord in 1985. In short, growth is 
attributed to the emergence of ethnic countries. Consider the 
following. By holding an international exposition, countries 
change the entire look of their cities. First in London, then 
in Vienna, Chicago, New York, and... the change in Tokyo took 
place exactly at the time of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Osaka at 
the Osaka Expo 1970, and Seoul at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. 
Expos or the Olympics have changed the faces of cities 
completely. 
  I wrote this thesis in the summer of 1993. After that, the 
former Beijing Bureau Chief for THE NEW YORK TIMES, Nicholas D. 
Kristof, wrote an article in the latest issue of FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
[Volume 72, No. 5]. He says the rise of China definitely 
changes the balance of power and it is dangerous. In addition, 
he says, because China has been subjected to various 
humiliations in the past, it is dangerous for such a country to 
gain power. In other words, Prussia was humiliated by the 
Napoleonic invasion, but it won in the end. He compares 
Bismarck to Deng Xiaoping. While Deng Xiaoping is in power it 
is all right, but when a person like Wilhelm II takes power, it 
is dangerous. In sum, he compares the rise of 19th century 
Germany to the current rise of China. This line of thinking is 
almost the same as mine. 
  In my essay, I tried an analogy between the present age and 
the 19th century in terms of strategic theory. First, England's 
manufacture of the Dreadnought made every existing warship 
obsolete. Then Germany, on the rise, tried to catch up with 
Britain by making a lot of Dreadnought-class warships. Although 
the United States currently places nonproliferation of mass 
destruction weapons as its first-priority objective, it does not 
have much effect. The high technology of the United States 
during the Cold War was always 10 years ahead of that of the 
Soviet Union, and at the same time it was preventing the 
proliferation of its technology under Cocom [Coordinating 
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] regulations. But no 
matter how it controlled the spread of technology, by the 10th 
year Soviet technology had always reached the same level of U.S. 
technology 10 years before. By the time the Soviet Union caught 
up to that level, of course, the United States had further 
developed its high technology again, and won the Cold War in the 
end. However, the United States has now started to reduce 
investments in high technology. Controlling the proliferation 
of weapons is not enough, because the technology is only 10 
years away for other nations. 
  So the level of military technology possessed by the United 
States and Japan in the Far East at the end of the Cold War--in 
other words, technology not so different from that used in the 
Gulf war--will be attained by China. And in terms of quantity, 
China will have more. What happened at the time of the 
Dreadnought will be repeated. So the comparison between 19th 
century Europe and modern Asia is significant. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] Very interesting. But, is there any solution 
to this situation? 
  [Okazaki] There will never be a solution. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] We have had a valuable opportunity to listen 
to you and how, using concrete examples, to analyze information. 
Thank you very much.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 29 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" informs that at the State Great Hural 
spring session consideration of the draft law on making 
amendments and additions in the criminal code of the country 
continues. 
  As the newspaper notes, the parliament members discussed an 
issue about the cases, which can be solved by a judge, about a 
right for participation of barristers in collecting the material 
evidences. The parliament members have paid a great attention to 
the issue about duration of keeping of the accused under the 
arrest in the investigation isolation ward. The working group 
was instructed to elaborate an issue about maximum duration of 
keeping the accused under investigation arrest. 
  As the newspaper informs, the Mongolian Government has 
adopted a resolution about raising the requirements for export 
of cashmere. In the resolution it is envisaged to deliver 
cashmere only after primary industrial processing and make 
payments in hard currency. The resolution will come into force 
from April 1. 
  In an interview with the newspaper correspondent, the 
president's chancellery official Yc. Dashdorj announces that the 
awarding of citizens with orders and medals has not taken place 
since the beginning of the current year as official registration 
of the documents have not met the new requirements. An issue 
about awarding citizens with orders and medals for the present 
is being postponed until the State Great Hural adopts a decision. 
  The newspaper informs that with assistance of the American 
company "Aerotech Airways" the project of expansion and 
reconstruction of the Ulaanbaatar Airport "buyant uhaa" is being 
worked out. 
  The project is planned to be realized at the expense of a 
credit worth 36 mln [million] US dollars granted by the Asian 
Development Bank. In the launched tender companies of England, 
Japan, Germany, the Republic of Korea are participating. The 
results of the tender will become known in the beginning of 
April. 
  The State Great Hural member C. Hurts, the general director 
of the Mining Department of the Ministry of Power, Geology and 
Mining Industry B. Tumurbaatar, the general director of the 
Corporation "Mongolian Gold" T. Oyunbileg are writing in the 
newspaper about the state policy in sphere of gold mining. They 
point out to necessity of increase of the explored reserves, 
support for medium and small enterprises. According the 
director of the corporation "Mongolian Gold" T. Oyunbileg, this 
corporation enjoys assistance of foreign investors in 
exploitation of big main deposits of gold. As the general 
director of the Mining Department B. 
  Tumurbaatar announces, in 1993 more than tonne of gold has 
been mined, in the current year about 2, 3 tonnes are expected 
to be mined. 
  In an interview with the newspaper correspondent the 
Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador of the Republic of 
Korea to Mongolia Kim Kyu-sik notes that his government is 
pursuing a course of rendering economic assistance to Mongolia 
in her transiting to market, of developing friendly cooperation 
between the two countries in the sphere of science, culture, 
sports. In the ambassador's view, in Mongolia many projects are 
being realized with assistance of foreign countries, but the 
Mongols first of all need to exert the main efforts themselves. 
The ambassador expresses satisfaction with successful 
development of cooperation of the Mongolian concern "Erdenet" 
with the well known South Korean Corporation "Samsung", points 
out to an interest of Korean firms in development of cooperation 
with Mongolian organizations, stressing the importance of 
creation of proper conditions for foreign investments. Kim 
Kyu-sik notes that in 1995 celebrated will be the thousandth 
anniversary of establishment of relations between Mongolian and 
Korean peoples, in connection with which it is planned to 
organize different measures. 
  The State Great Hural member C. Bayanjargal in the newspaper 
disproves the attacks of the representative of the opposition 
parties in the parliament T. Elbegdorj against the Mongolian 
People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP). He considers that the 
accusations brought by him are pursuing political purpose in the 
interparty struggle. 
  The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party central newspaper 
"UNEN" comments the beginning of work of the State Great Hural 
spring session. 
  The newspaper's parliament correspondent S. Tserenpil 
considers that the session started working under conditions of 
confrontation between the parliament majority and the opposition 
forces, which in a certain time has been refusing to participate 
in the session. 
  The correspondent notes out of approximately 200 proposals 
of 
the opposition minority 70-80 percent have been reflected in the 
adopted laws. 
  The newspaper carries an article about political 
repressions. 
The author of the article Sn. Batochir considers that political 
repressions have been spreading in the country under the 
pressure of foreign countries and with support of internal 
reactioners [as received], who rated their narrow interests 
above everything. In the author's view, figures of the National 
Liberation Movement in times of the Manchurian colonial 
oppression in 18th century were subjected to political 
repressions. The author considers that a new wave of political 
repressions has appeared in 1930's under the influence of the 
"theories" about socialism, public property, and the proletarian 
dictatorship. As the author writes, the new spire of 
repressions has happened in 1956-1960, when many representatives 
of intelligentsia have been subjected to repressions on 
political charges. The author notes that the state should in 
time prevent the unleashing of repressions on political charges, 
guarantee the human rights.
