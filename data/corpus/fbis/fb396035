  [Text] On 24 February at Radio Rebelde's Studio No. 2, in a 
ceremony marking Rebelde's 36th anniversary, Fidel spoke of the 
role that radio plays under the current circumstances: 
  [Begin recording] [Words indistinct] very clearly the 
decisive role radio has at present. I could compare this moment 
of the special period, this political moment the nation is 
facing, with those days of fighting in the Sierra Maestra, with 
those days in 1958 we have been mentioning here. The difference 
is that this period is more prolonged. I would say that this 
period is more difficult than that one. It requires more talent, 
more commitment. The work is done under very complex conditions 
today, particularly following the hard blows the national 
economy has experienced. Only as a miracle of human will could 
the country's resistance be explained. So now I see radio in 
general -- I am not referring to Radio Rebelde alone, as a great 
rebel radio -- in a period similar to that one, in a very 
difficult and decisive moment. And I hope the workers, the 
reporters, all those who work at in radio will be aware of this 
and will be at the level of Radio Rebelde back then. 
  Some day new generations will meet here again, the younger 
ones and some of the older ones will meet here again, and they 
will meet to recall the important role played by radio during 
these difficult days of the special period. [applause] [end 
recording] 
  [Radio Progreso adds later in the broadcast that Castro's 
visit to Radio Rebelde lasted over three hours and that he 
stressed that, for very clear and objective reasons, nothing 
today compares to radio. Castro pointed out that the role of 
radio as a means of communication is growing: The print media 
are limited because of paper shortages and television has 
significantly reduced its programing because of problems with 
electric power and resources. Progreso adds that Castro said 
that in the Sierra we faced a local tyrant supported by 
imperialism, while today we are confronting head-on an 
imperialism that is employing every recourse in an effort to 
destroy us. Castro underscored that today we are conducting a 
greater and more meritorious struggle that the one waged then.]

<F P=106> [Report by reporter Roberto Canela] </F>
  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina Gonzalez has 
told the Pinar del Rio newspaper EL GUERRILLERO that the 
nation-exile community conference scheduled for next April seeks 
to return a normal communication process to relations between 
Cuba and the exile community. He added that all countries 
throughout the world have relations with their residents abroad, 
and Cuba should be no exception. 
  Robaina explained that we must reestablish normal relations 
with our community abroad, and that this relationship must 
include all residents abroad, not just those in the United 
States. He said it is impossible to speak of an opening to the 
world without including the existence of our fellow citizens 
globally. He added that it is not Cuba that excludes the 
hostile, aggressive ones. They exclude themselves. 
  Robaina concluded by saying that our foreign policy is 
integral to a people and a revolution accustomed to surprises 
and to gaining power where it appears not to exist. If foreign 
policy can do this, it is a reflection of the desires of the 
people and the Revolution.

  [Text] GRANMA newspaper has stated that a group of persons 
of Cuban origin who live abroad and proclaim they want to annex 
the Caribbean island to the United States lack the essential 
ethical conditions to participate in the conference The Nation 
and the Immigrant Community, which will be held in Havana in 
April. 
  An article signed by journalist Nicanor Leon Cotayo and 
published in GRANMA's Saturday edition reports that 
annexationists of Cuban origin who live in the United States 
deploy a campaign to maintain a blockade against the people of 
the largest island in the Antilles. 
  The article -- entitled "Keep Out, Annexationists" -- says 
that in a poll recently performed in Miami 40 percent of the 
people stated they reject the blockade against Cuba and that the 
number of people who protest against this unfair measure is 
increasing significantly in the United States. GRANMA 
emphasizes that the annexationists' views coincide with those of 
extreme-right U.S. politicians of the last century.

<F P=106> [Report by Marianela Samper] </F>
  [Excerpts] FBI sources in Miami have reported that 
representatives from the FBI and the Attorney General's Office 
will meet to determine whether or not the paramilitary group 
Alpha-66 should be investigated regarding several threatening 
letters circulating in Miami. In the notes, Alpha-66 warns that 
they will regard as military targets anyone, anywhere in the 
world who visits Cuba, negotiates with the Cuban Government, or 
expresses support for this country. [passage omitted] 
  Orestes Joubert, Cubanacan deputy manager in Granma 
Province, 
reports that Alpha-66 has threatened Canadian tourists who made 
reservations at the new Farallon del Caribe Hotel last year. 
  [Begin Joubert recording] As we all know, this hotel was 
inaugurated in November after considerable hype. The number of 
reservations made in Canada in October was large. A large number 
of tourists were expected after November. Nevertheless, we found 
that this number had been greatly reduced because requests for 
visas for 40 percent of those who had made reservations had been 
turned down. We wondered about the situation. Through some 
Canadian papers we learned that a counterrevolutionary 
organization called Alpha-66 had unleashed a campaign against 
Cuba through newspapers and radio and television stations. Much 
to our satisfaction, however, this situation lasted only a few 
days. Since late December, 90 percent of the hotel rooms have 
remained occupied. [end recording] 
  This is new evidence showing that Alpha-66 attempts to 
prevent everyone from coming to Cuba with the specific purpose, 
in this particular instance, of blocking one of the country's 
leading development sectors. They did not prevail, but this 
attempt can be added to the long list of actions against Cuba 
when an inquiry is opened.

  [Text] Colombian Mines and Energy Minister Guido Nule has 
reported that Colombia will sell between 15,000 and 20,000 
barrels of crude oil daily to Cuba beginning next June. The oil 
will be sold at the normal international price and there will be 
no compensation or barter mechanism, the report adds. 
  Another report from Bogota adds that the Barranquilla 
Municipal Council has condemned the U.S. blockade against Cuba, 
and that Barranquilla and Matanzas will soon be declared sister 
cities for possible cooperation. Cuban Ambassador to Colombia 
Jesus Martinez also paid a visit to Barranquilla. He learned 
details about the project to declare Barranquilla and Matanzas 
sister cities and that this will probably take place when 
Barranquilla Mayor (Bernardo Hoyos) visits Cuba by mid-March. 
The ambassador held a lengthy conversation with the Barranquilla 
mayor. 
  Ambassador Martinez also held meetings with the governor of 
Atlantico Department, (Gustavo Bell), businessmen, health 
officials, university students, and professors. During the 
meetings they discussed prospects for cooperation in different 
fields, many of which will be included in the declaration of 
sister cities. These cooperation prospects will be developed 
mainly in sports and cultural, touristic, and scientific 
activities.

<F P=106> [Interview with Pedro Perez, director of the Cuban import </F>
company, Cubametales, by reporter Carlos Santana Ojeda -- place 
and date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Santana] What can you tell us, Pedro, about this 
report on the sale of Colombian crude oil to Cuba? 
  [Perez] I can tell you that for many years Cubametales [Cuba 
Metal Import Enterprise] has been holding talks with the 
Colombian company Copetrol [expansion unknown] for direct supply 
of Colombian crude oil to Cuba because this is a product we know 
very well, having been receiving it through negotiations with 
other commercial companies. 
  We recently held a new meeting to discuss the possibility of 
this sale under normal market conditions. The Colombian 
officials are studying this, and we are waiting for the final 
results of those studies. This is the situation today concerning 
the possible supply of Colombian petroleum to our country. 
  [Santana] Pedro, I have an AFP report that says Colombia 
will 
sell from 15,000 to 20,000 barrels of petroleum to Cuba daily as 
of next June. Can this be taken as a confirmation of the 
situation? 
  [Perez] Well, that is a point of reference because petroleum 
amounts are usually determined according to shipments received 
at port, not according to daily delivery of products. In any 
case, I believe that is an amount we can assimilate. It will be 
so -- or it can be so -- if we reach an agreement. 
  [Santana] Well, you have just heard the news we received 
here 
at our studio confirmed by Pedro Perez, director of Cubametales.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Guido Nule Amin, Colombian Mines </F>
and Energy Minister, by reporter Maria Helena Alonso at the 
Radio Rebelde studio in Havana -- live] 
  [Text] [unidentified speaker in Colombia] Hello. Just a 
moment please. The minister is on his way. Here he comes. 
  [Nule] This is Guido Nule speaking. 
  [Alonso] Mr. Minister, we are contacting you from Havana. 
This is Radio Rebelde from Havana. Minister, please, we have 
here a press report that includes some remarks you made, that 
Colombia will sell petroleum to Cuba, that this will be one of 
the first trade agreements between the governments of Bogota and 
Havana following the reestablishment of diplomatic relations in 
October 1993. We would like to have a confirmation from you 
about these remarks. 
  [Nule] Look, I can confirm the following for you: [words 
indistinct] and I were in Cuba over the past weekend to talk 
about the subject. We talked about that possibility and need 
only to brush up the final details. But there is interest (?both 
in Colombia and in Cuba) to conclude these negotiations. 
  [Alonso] And how will Cuba pay for it, Minister? What are 
the 
terms? 
  [Nule] Well, the idea is that Cuba will purchase the 
Colombian petroleum under normal commercial conditions; that is, 
at international prices; and Cuba will pay for it in hard 
currency. But there is the possibility of giving [word 
indistinct] for the payment. 
  [Alonso] When will these exports begin? 
  [Nule] Well, the idea is to begin exports as of July this 
year. 
  [Alonso] How much petroleum will be sold to Cuba, Minister? 
  [Nule] Between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels a day. 
  [Alonso] Between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels a day. Very well. 
We have thus confirmed this report. In conclusion, Minister, we 
would also like to know whether it is in the interest of 
Colombia to sell this petroleum to our country? 
  [Nule] Yes, of course. And this is what Cuba needs there. 
  [Alonso] Very well, thank you very much, Minister. 
  [Nule] Well, so long. 
  [Alonso] So long.

  [Text] With Division General Ulises Rosales del Toro in 
attendance, a class to demonstrate how to maintain agricultural 
equipment and machinery took place at the Alquizar Municipality 
Miscellaneous Crops Enterprise in Havana Province. Del Toro is a 
first vice minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR]. 
  A group of leaders and specialists from Minaz [Ministry of 
the Sugar Industry], Minbas [Ministry of Basic Industry], Micons 
[Ministry of Construction], and (CATM) participated in this 
class. 
  Earlier, FAR specialists led by Division General (Ramon Pato 
Guerra) had contributed to creating the conditions that 
facilitated this demonstration -- which is today extremely 
important, according to Army General Raul Castro, because the 
nation has the unavoidable need to maintain the equipment, 
parts, and technical resources that are temporarily immobilized. 
Castro also said this is a timely moment to extend the FAR's 
preservation expertise to all branches of the economy. 
  The Armed Forces are so far maintaining millions of pieces 
of 
equipment, which range from tanks and armaments of all kinds to 
gas masks. Over 500 technical cadres and machinery experts in 
Havana and other provinces have seen this demonstration. The 
intention is to hold this kind of workshop all over the country. 
  The participants in this class toured various departments, 
warehouses, and workshops belonging to this enterprise, where 
they saw what measures have been taken to counteract humidity 
and to preserve hydraulic and lubrication systems and the costly 
resources used in irrigation. 
  Everywhere, there is one constant: economizing with material 
and human resources, with new principles of organization, and 
technical discipline. 
  [Begin recording] [unidentified man] That is, not only does 
everything depend on resources, but much also depends on 
attitude, and how we confront problems, and on everything... 
[rephrases] on an organizational system about which, as is 
known, we indeed have quite a bit to learn (?from) our FAR 
comrades. 
  [Rosales del Toro] In the demonstration that was given here, 
we have been able to see how, very simply, using the same 
installations and the same comrades -- with the magnificent 
training and experience they have -- but by establishing a 
system, and maintaining the methodological procedures, and 
applying these experiences that all the organizations... 
[changes thought] and we can say that it is not just the FAR, 
because we have (?drunk deeply) of the nation's experiences 
[returns to original line of thought], these things can be 
introduced. 
  I am completely sure that the year 1994 can become a year in 
which to rescue the Revolution's fundamental resources, to 
preserve them, and guarantee that for the next two or three 
years, we have at least a response, on the basis of what we 
already have, on the basis of what we already possess. [end 
recording]

  [Text] The presidents of the provincial executive councils 
of the National Association of Cuban Economists [ANEC] has met 
with the national organizing committee of the Cuban Economists 
Congress. Jose Luis Rodriguez, minister president of the State 
Committee for Finances, participated in the meeting and gave a 
detailed report on measures under study to streamline national 
finances on the basis of the workers assemblies discussions. 
Rodriguez pointed out that the adoption of measures to protect 
the lowest income strata in the nation are being studied. The 
meeting was useful in clarifying the participants' doubts and in 
discussion of alternatives. 
  According ANEC president Aristides Naranjo, the meeting was 
essential to review the progress of the work conducted in the 
provinces by ANEC's more than 18,000 members in support of the 
efforts of the Basic Cooperative Production Units, People's 
Councils, and Administrative Councils. 
  The Cuban economists are also participating in the workers 
assemblies to offer their opinions in the search for solutions 
to improve the national economy.

  (Ruiz Cubiles) added: Since we began these relations 14 
years 
ago, we have passed through several stages. The first was 
advisory and course-oriented; the second, over the past five 
years, involved the implementation of some projects, with others 
still pending approval. Now we can say that the '94 Information 
Science Conference represents the starting point of a third 
stage, during which the Cuba-Spain-Unesco triangle can hopefully 
facilitate greater participation by public and private companies 
in these projects. 
  (Ruiz Cubiles) said that these companies must take a more 
entrepreneurial view, more concerned about the projects' profits 
and economic gains.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 
Havana radio and television in Spanish between 22 and 25 
February. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 22 February reports that eight 
Havana universities will initiate graduate level summer schools 
to run from 20 June to 19 August. According to Deputy Minister 
of Education Rodolfo Alarcon Ortiz, the courses will be open to 
foreign students, whose tuition will supplement university 
income. 
  Radio Reloj in its 2030-3100 GMT newscast on 22 February 
reports the following: 
  Two new centers for making biological pesticides have been 
inaugurated in Sancti Spiritus Province. The centers are part of 
a project financed by the nongovernmental organization "Bread 
for the World" and are located in the Banao area in Sancti 
Spiritus Municipality and on the Nueva Cuba 
Agricultural-Livestock Production Cooperative in Cabaiguan. 
  Cuba and the Dominican Republic have signed a sports 
cooperation agreement whereby Cuban swimming and track and field 
trainers will offer their knowledge to Dominican athletes as of 
March. The agreement provides for consulting by Cuban trainers 
in other sports as well. 
  Guantanamo is to have a provincial biopharmaceutical 
laboratory as of next month, for the production of medicines and 
vaccines for humans and animals. 
  "Camaguey construction workers have built works worth some 
77 
million pesos. This figure represents a drop of slightly over 50 
percent compared to 1989." Over 1,300 low-cost houses were 
finished in 1993. Only 500 of these were built by organizations 
belonging to the sector itself, "which does not correspond to 
the resources and means that the Ministry of Construction has at 
its disposal, as manager of these investments." 
  Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 22 February reports that 
self- sufficiency and service granges are being formed in 
high-potential municipalities in Havana Province at the 
initiative of the Cuban Government and the Communist Party of 
Cuba. "These granges are to become suppliers for nearby towns, 
gastronomic units, and workers' dining rooms." Ten Havana 
Province municipalities are to have such structures in marginal 
lands, with a view to solving the demand for such production in 
the area. Also, three new tourist installations have been 
inaugurated in Holguin Province: a marina in Boca de Sama [Bay]; 
a new restaurant, El Fuerte, in Guarda la Vaca; and the La Roca 
nightclub. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 23 February reports that as 
part 
of the solidarity with Cuba campaign being carried out in 
Canada, the ship Energy arrived in Cuba bringing donations 
estimated at $250,000. The donations include 10 containers with 
some 80 tons of specialized medical equipment, bicycles, papers, 
and wheelchairs. 
  Cuba Vision at 0200 GMT on 23 February reports that in the 
last 32 years over 221 million vaccination doses have been 
distributed in Cuba. This resulted in the elimination of polio 
in 1962, diphtheria in 1969, neonatal tetanus in 1972; there 
were only two cases of whooping cough reported in 1993. There 
have been no cases of measles in 18 months. There were fewer 
than 10 cases each of rubella and mumps in 1993. Meningitis was 
widespread in the 80's but there were only 69 cases in 1993. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 23 February reports that 
representatives from more than 20 countries are participating in 
the Computing-94 conference being held at the Havana Convention 
Center. Computer Science Expert (Arturo Rivagorda), who is also 
chairman of the Spanish national association of computer 
security systems, in stressing the importance of this 
conference, said that the efforts being made in this area are 
the same as those being made worldwide and that Cuba can 
perfectly well become integrated with countries of other 
regions, including Europe. 
  Cuba Vision at 2320 GMT on 23 February reports that the 
Labor 
Union of the Banco Popular Espanol made a donation to the 
campaign for the children of Chernobyl receiving treatment in 
Cuba. Workers donate 1 percent of their wages; so far, they have 
collected $4,000. 
  Radio Reloj at 1530 GMT on 25 February reports that members 
of the National Association of Innovators and Efficiency Experts 
in Santiago de Cuba have managed to establish a new system to be 
added to the irrigation system that will help cut fuel by 13 
percent. The provincial board has thus declared that this new 
system will be added to all equipment with Motor A-41 during the 
first quarter of this year.

  [Text] Havana, 19 Feb (EFE) -- Cuban Education Minister 
Luis Ignacio Gomez Gutierrez asserted today, "we don't have any 
unnecessary teachers" and, despite the island's economic 
problems, "no schools will be closed." The minister said in an 
interview published by the official GRANMA newspaper today: "In 
education, our criteria is that we don't have any unnecessary 
teachers or professors who have a vocation for this beautiful 
mission." 
  "The Revolution will never relinquish this socialist victory 
and no school will be closed," the Cuban education minister 
stressed. "Education is the Revolution's colossal achievement; 
its most beautiful treasure. In the past 35 years, we have 
organized and implemented the most accomplished education system 
ever conceived in an underdeveloped country. Our system is 
comparable to those in many developed nations," Gomez Gutierrez 
added. 
  The Cuban minister emphasized the good results obtained with 
the improvement of the education system's organization and study 
and textbook programs. "However, the country's most important 
achievement is the creation of a powerful army of teachers. 
They have been a decisive factor in the battle to attain 
quality education," he asserted. In this sense, Gomez indicated 
there are thousands of teachers in reserve "who are critical to 
being able to permanently improve the quality of teaching 
personnel." He observed that the current optimization of the 
education system "does not imply that personnel will be reduced. 
Rather, it will allow teachers, who are not currently required 
at schools during the next academic year, to further their 
academic training." 
  The minister added that starting in September, the 
Upper-Level Teachers' Institute will organize several 
improvement courses. Also, teachers who have not completed their 
studies will be able to get their degrees. Gomez said the 
enhancement of the teachers' academic standing, due to its 
contents, "is essentially a political task."

  [Text] Mexico City, 27 Feb (EFE) -- It was disclosed today 
that the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) command last 
night released a communique demanding free and democratic 
elections, the Mexican Government's resignation, and its 
replacement by a transition government that will guarantee 
equality. 
  To guarantee free elections, the EZLN has called for the 
legalization of the presence and participation of citizens in 
the observation of the electoral process, thus sanctioning the 
process' legality and guaranteeing the elections' legitimacy. 
  The EZLN command establishes that a necessary condition for 
democratic elections is the resignation of authorities "who 
attained power through electoral frauds" and the formation of a 
transition government so there will be equality and respect for 
all political trends. 
  The sixth day of Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis' 
dialogue with the EZLN representatives and the mediation of 
Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, concluded 
with a communique that points out that the peace dialogue 
sessions have continued in a spirit of work and responsibility. 
  "We cannot overlook" -- the document states -- "that at this 
time we are dealing with the most critical part of the 
agreements. This means that we will work with a spirit of 
responsibility. We are aware that everything that is agreed 
upon at the dialogue in Chiapas will have profound repercussions 
on the country's future." 
  The communique, signed by "Subcommander Marcos," 
Commissioner 
Manuel Camacho, and Bishop Samuel Ruiz, points out that the 
joint effort, seriousness, work, and exchange of ideas for the 
purpose of listening to and understanding each other to find the 
best possible solutions will culminate in positive results. 
  The EZLN and Mexican Government are in a negotiations 
process 
to resolve the armed conflict that began on 1 January with the 
EZLN insurrection and the armed clashes that cost the lives of 
at least 200 people, wounded approximately 500, and displaced 
thousands from their hometowns in the mountains of Chiapas. 
  During the six days that have passed since the peace talks 
began at the San Cristobal Cathedral, progress has been made on 
approximately 50 percent of the scheduled agenda, the part that 
deals with the immediate and urgent demands of the Indian 
population. Nevertheless, the current discussion has come down 
to the points that deal with Mexico's general problems, 
including political issues and demands such as the demand for 
democratic elections and the mechanisms to guarantee equality 
and legitimacy.

<F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] [Unidentified announcer] Let's go to another issue. 
One that is, of course, also very important. We know you are 
all waiting eagerly for this information. We are referring to 
the situation in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, where the 
peace and reconciliation talks are being held. The usual news 
conference was not held after the fifth day of talks today. 
During this week, Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho, 
Subcommander Marcos on behalf of the EZLN [Zapatist National 
Liberation Army], and Bishop Samuel Ruiz, as mediator in this 
conflict, held a daily news conference to give an update of the 
talks to reporters at approximately 1800 to 1830. 
  Good evening, Jose Luis Sarmiento in San Cristobal de las 
Casas. Can you tell us what happened? Why was there no news 
conference? 
  [Sarmiento] As you said, there will be no statements to the 
press on advances in the peace and reconciliation talks in 
Chiapas. Francisco de los Santos, the official spokesman of the 
San Cristobal de las Casas bishopric, reported there will be no 
reports on the talks between Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho 
Solis and the EZLN delegates until further notice. This is all 
we were told. We were also told the EZLN list of demands 
received positive responses. 
  [Announcer] We understood from the information you reported 
to the first edition of the ACIR Radio News newscast at 1300 
that Subcommander Marcos met with reporters who write for 
newspapers in Mexican states and told them there is still a long 
road to traverse to achieve peace with dignity, although 
important advances had been made and significant points 
resolved, 50 percent of them positively. He also said the talks 
are now entering a more difficult stage. 
  [Sarmiento] Correct. As you reported Subcommander Marcos 
said this morning the most difficult part of the talks for peace 
and reconciliation in Chiapas had begun. He said peace will not 
come out of San Cristobal de las Casas, only the mechanisms to 
reach it. He said, as you already stated, although there have 
been favorable responses to problems--especially those dealing 
with health, housing, education, among others--in the Chiapas 
Indian communities, those are local demands. They now also 
expect a positive response to their national demands, such as 
justice, land, liberty, and self- government for all the Indian 
communities in the country. 
  [Begin Subcommander Marcos recording] The points that have 
yet to be discussed are the most difficult ones. We decided to 
start with the points that were apparently easier to resolve, so 
as to advance. The most difficult, controversial points are 
the ones that follow. The talks will become more difficult, 
because now we will discuss demands the companeros have asked, 
not for themselves, rather, for the country. [Words indistinct] 
respect for the Indians, [words indistinct] self-government 
program, reform of the Fourth Article, guaranteed 
self-government, and other measures [words indistinct] [end 
recording] 
  [Sarmiento] Subcommander Marcos and the 18 EZLN delegates 
who 
are participating in the talks, as you said, met with 
representatives of the provincial newspapers in Mexico this 
morning. 
  In addition, the seven bishops who comprise the 
Reconciliation Commission, which is presided by Adolfo Suarez 
Rivera, visited the Chiapas highlands for the third time. They 
said they have already seen encouraging signs in favor of peace; 
nevertheless, they called on Mexican society not to close their 
hearts to the just demands of the communities. Tapachula 
Chiapas Bishop Felipe Arizmendi stated: 
  [Begin Arizmendi recording] I hope we do not close our minds 
and hearts to hear the community's just demands. From the 
start, the three Chiapas bishops have stated we do not agree 
with the armed action, but it should serve as a warning, because 
violence will erupt at any time and in any manner if margined 
groups are neglected. [end recording] 
  [Sarmiento] All the domestic and foreign reporters who are 
here in San Cristobal de las Casas are still attentive to the 
peace and reconciliation talks.

  [Text] After 48 hours of tension and silence Manuel 
Camacho Solis, peace and reconciliation commissioner for 
Chiapas, and the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] 
released a brief communique disclosing that they are currently 
working on the most critical part of the agreements but that 
they expect positive results. 
  For eight days since the opening of the talks Camacho has 
been unable to leave the area. There have been reports to the 
effect that the situation inside the capital [as heard] is 
difficult. 
  Meanwhile, the Indian Revolutionary Clandestine Committee 
General Command issued a text asserting that to achieve free and 
democratic elections, the head of the federal Executive Branch 
must resign and a transition government be formed. It also 
calls for truly free and democratic elections with equal rights 
and duties for the political organizations that are struggling 
for power. 
  Strangely, however, the communique signed by Subcommander 
Marcos is written in biblical language; it is as if they 
extracted their words and phrases from the Bible. It is a very, 
very strange communique.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, 25 Feb (EFE) -- The 24 
alleged Zapatists imprisoned in Tuxtla Gutierrez, capital of 
Chiapas State, have presented reports of torture, isolation, and 
starvation for several days, which are currently being 
investigated by the state authorities. 
  In an interview held on Thursday evening with Chiapas 
Governor Javier Lopez Moreno at Cerro Hueco Prison, the 24 
members of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) 
complained about mistreatment. Among other things, the Zapatists 
said they were denied medical attention and food. They added 
that they were isolated and some of them tortured for hours and 
that no authority tried to prevent this, a government source 
told EFE today. 
  Father Pablo Romo, member of the Fray Bartolome de las Casas 
Human Rights Center (led by Bishop Samuel Ruiz, mediator in the 
armed conflict), told EFE the Zapatists were subject to physical 
and psychological torture. "The tortures and threats -- which he 
did not specify -- mainly occurred at the time of their arrest 
rather than in prison, but other arbitrary actions occurred 
there," Romo said. 
  The EZLN members were arrested, along with 46 comrades who 
have been released, shortly after the EZLN's 1 January military 
uprising, and their release has been demanded on numerous 
occasions by nongovernment human rights organizations and the 
EZLN general command. 
  Following his meeting with the prisoners, the governor said 
an investigation will be ordered "to ascertain if the inmates' 
complaints are justified" and, if they are, the culprits will be 
"severely" punished. "I am interested in an investigation to 
learn if it is true this abuse was perpetrated. All the 
complaints will be investigated because no inmate's human rights 
should be violated," the governor stated. 
  Lopez Moreno visited the Cerro Hueco Prison a day after 
meeting with Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, chairman of the National 
Human Rights Commission. It is surmised they discussed the 
Zapatists' case during the meeting. 
  Pablo Romo told EFE that the Zapatists who have already been 
released were also subject to arbitrary actions at the time of 
their arrest and during their imprisonment and that "it is 
almost certain they will file criminal charges against their 
aggressors." Romo admitted the government is "firmly" determined 
to receive and solve their complaints because it will not let 
the authorities perpetrate illegal actions. 
  Two weeks ago the Chiapas Congress approved a law to punish 
torture, and it adheres to other reforms carried out by Chiapas 
State legislation within the last 40 days to decriminalize 
certain activities, including riots and demonstrations against 
the government, which were formerly punishable. The reforms were 
followed by the approval of an amnesty law for the Chiapas 
rebels and other groups which might rise up in arms, but it 
holds the amnesty contingent with the surrender of weapons. 
  Thirty-eight of the 70 Zapatists arrested at the beginning 
of 
the armed conflict were released on 28 January, and eight more 
were released on 22 February following recommendations from the 
Attorney General's Office to the state's Superior Court of 
Justice. All the released rebels had to pay between $330 and 
$666 each to leave prison. Their bail was paid by the National 
Indian Institute and the Fund for the Management of State 
Justice, given the EZLN's lack of resources.

<F P=106> [Article by Luis Hernandez Navarro] </F>
  [Text] On 2 January, just hours after the EZLN [Zapatist 
National Liberation Army] declared war on the Mexican Army, the 
ARIC [expansion unknown]-Ocosingo Federation of Unions 
[ARIC-Union de Uniones de Ocosingo] stated in an advertisement 
published in the national press: "Over the years, we have made 
demands and managed to establish a direct and fruitful dialogue 
with government institutions to expand the support necessary for 
advancing regional development. This is supported by the 
actions we have carried out with the government of President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari...." 
  ARIC called the EZLN's armed revolt an event that would 
threaten security, increase anguish, and impede the attainment 
of justice. It also called on peasants in the region to reject 
violence. The advertisement, which was also signed by two 
regional peasant groups, was, in essence, a declaration of war 
on the EZLN. Strangely, however, the published advertisement 
did not include the names of all of the directors of the 
relevant organizations -- obviously, they were not in the union 
offices at the time -- although all of these organizations have 
a long tradition of consulting one another before making 
important decisions. 
  Actually, the advertisement was planned and written in a 
government office, and its objective was to "isolate" the Indian 
rebellion and present it to the public as an initiative that 
lacked regional consensus. Although, the federal government 
ultimately had enough insight not to continue publishing similar 
ads, the damage had already been done. The long-standing 
problem between the two political forces that work in the same 
territory -- those sympathetic to the EZLN and part of ARIC's 
directors and advisers -- was made public. 
  Very quickly, however, the EZLN was able to prove to the 
nation that its decision to go to war had ample support in the 
communities where it operated and that it was a 
political-military force formed by Indians from various tribes. 
As if this were not enough, the vast majority of the 
organizations in the State Council of Indian and Peasant 
Organizations (CEOIC) of Chiapas [Consejo Estatal de 
Organizaciones Indigenas y Campesinas (CEOIC) de Chiapas] 
decided to support the Zapatist struggle. In turn, positions 
like the one initially adopted by the ARIC directorate are now 
viewed as being virtually isolated. 
  In the same geographic and social arenas in which the ARIC 
directorate and the EZLN currently operate, other forces with 
less conspicuous political profiles exist -- for example, the 
UGOCP [General Union of Workers and Peasants of Mexico], the CNC 
[National Peasant Confederation], the CIOAC [Independent 
Federation of Agricultural Workers and Peasants], and so on. 
Actually, whether with or without intending to do so, the EZLN 
current penetrated the rank-and-file of these organizations and 
won them over to its cause. 
  The history of the Federation of Unions, as that of any 
peasant organization subjected to the harassment of its natural 
enemies and the state government, is far from idyllic. After 
growing and becoming the most important autonomous organization 
in terms of numbers in Chiapas State, it has suffered from a 
painful split by those who have built credit unions and decided 
to postpone the struggle for land. It suffered from an 
inefficient and corrupt board of directors, which was finally 
dismissed. It had to face the departure of a series of leaders 
and ejido [a form of land tenure] unions, who without completely 
giving up their organization have decided to operate outside the 
organization. After suffering from the separation of the ejido 
unions, it faced the worst experiences in coffee marketing amid 
a somewhat severe criticism of bureaucratism. It finally saw 
how in its ranks the young and old became increasingly tired of 
getting scant practical results via peaceful means and decided 
to resort to the use of weapons. In sum, it saw how its initial 
project crumbled while totally different political positions 
were being adopted inside the organization. 
  Even though it cannot be said all the communities and all 
the 
individuals of the region are behind the EZLN (has there ever 
been a social movement in which this has occurred?), it is 
evident the call for an armed struggle succeeded, which does not 
mean all the ARIC rank and file supported the EZLN. The number 
of troops mobilized by the Zapatists during the occupation of 
municipal capitals and the nearby towns on 1 January is evidence 
of that. 
  After the unfortunate initial deployment of troops, the ARIC 
Board of Directors called for a political solution to the 
conflict, a respect for the people and belongings of those who 
do not believe in the armed solution, a return home, freedom of 
movement, and peace with justice. Meanwhile, the EZLN thought 
certain ARIC leaders and advisers had betrayed them and had 
become instruments of the government. A significant number of 
organizations of the CEOIC believes ARIC seeks an isolation of 
the Zapatists. 
  Some 500 people, under ARIC's influence, participated in a 
pilgrimage on 20 February for "peace, reconciliation, and 
respect for human rights." Organization leaders did not attend. 
According to news reports, calls of vivas for the EZLN were 
heard during the event. The demands made during the pilgrimage 
were published in at least two national newspapers a day later. 
Even though the event was given a religious tone locally, at a 
national level it appeared as part of a broader campaign aimed 
at showing there are other means of struggle in the conflict 
area. In fact, the initiative seems to be the result of a 
broader proposal: to make ARIC appear as a third force in the 
conflict and to include it in the negotiations. 
  The accusations the EZLN has made against certain ARIC 
leaders, which it called traitors, seem unjustified. To accuse 
someone of treason in a situation of war is very serious. 
Certainly, among ARIC leaders there are probably former EZLN 
members who did not want to join the armed struggle. That does 
not make them informers, however. The purge of political forces 
is a natural process in every institution, and it can hardly be 
resolved by settling scores. Certain ARIC advisers have 
explicitly declared, even if they do not share the armed 
struggle, they are far from accusing those who have taken that 
path. The EZLN's accusation can work against it. A provocation 
by any person affected by the current rebellion against an ARIC 
member will be presented to public scrutiny as a Zapatist 
aggression. 
  The ARIC leadership must state, however, its initiative to 
present itself as a third party in disagreement; first, because 
there are more people in its situation; second, because ARIC has 
the doors of negotiation open to its demands equally or more 
than the rest of the state's peasant organizations, individually 
or through the CEOIC; third, because the other negotiation, that 
of war or peace, is held between the EZLN and the peace 
commissioner, and ARIC is not a party in this phase of the 
process. Just as a strike is negotiated between those who 
declare it and the boss--and not between those who oppose 
it--peace is discussed with those who have declared war. There 
is no third force in disagreement here, rather, a mediator who 
has been named and accepted by the parties. If given the EZLN 
postulate of "everything for all..." the ARIC leadership sets 
first its presence in the territory of conflict; it will see its 
prestige before public opinion deteriorate more than it already 
has. 
  The Union of Ejidos of the Jungle and the EZLN have named 
their corresponding "commissioners for peace" and have begun to 
negotiate the path to reconciliation from below. Other segments 
within ARIC seem to have undertaken a similar path. The fact is 
significant and encouraging, but it is not enough. In a context 
in which a national agenda much broader than that of four 
municipalities is being negotiated, the ARIC leadership is faced 
with the dilemma of endorsing this process or appearing at best, 
despite its statements, as victim of a narrow vision of its past 
and interests and, at worst, as an instrument of the 
counterinsurgency.

<F P=106> [Report by Raul Llanos Samaniego] </F>
  [Text] According to an analysis by the National Association 
of the Processing Industry (Canacintra), the past decade's 
economic crisis and the "painful" adjustments of the current 
economic policy have cost the country in terms of development of 
the infrastructure. The federal government must urgently invest 
more funds in this sector, or it will be difficult for Mexico to 
achieve sustained economic development. 
  According to the Association's study, the infrastructure in 
its current state will require sufficient funds, a desire to 
produce, and time to develop projects. This represents a 
challenge for the public and private sectors as they must play a 
more active role in this area. 
  The report added that despite the advancements made by the 
current government, it is necessary to redouble efforts. As we 
approach the 21st century, there will be approximately 100 
million Mexicans whose demands for infrastructure and 
communications services will rapidly grow. 
  "Much remains to be done to expand investments and improve 
services. Federal, state, and municipal authorities, 
businessmen, and workers must share the responsibility. Neither 
the government nor the private sector can carry out the 
modernization alone, the report noted. 
  In assessing the condition of the highway system, the 
Canacintra document said that maintenance of that system and of 
rural roads has been lagging for years. It adds that there are 
not enough roads in some parts of the country, there is lack of 
security in cargo and passenger transportation, and high tolls 
keep traffic flow on the largest freeways below capacity. 
  There are plans to channel sufficient and timely fiscal 
resources to the maintenance of prioritized stretches of the 
federal highway system. There are also plans to improve 
concession guidelines based on "realistic financial analyses," 
in addition to reinforcing the training and moralization of the 
Federal Highway Police and supplying adequate equipment. 
  In analyzing public transportation, the report notes that 
the 
equipment is obsolete, the service lacks "overall quality," very 
little is known about the contents of the new regulation on 
weights and measures, and there is limited standardization of 
cargo handling. 
  In view of the importance of this activity, Canacintra has 
recommended that the federal government encourage equipment 
upgrades and reconsider the deadlines for implementing the 
regulations on weights and dimensions, which should then be 
published. 
  The analysis also included railroads, ports, 
telecommunications, and the national electricity service, areas 
in which we are lagging behind and which therefore require 
attention so the productivity of enterprises is not negatively 
affected when they are facing international competition. 
  The report added that expanding the infrastructure will 
encourage the proper use of competitive advantages already 
enjoyed by some productive activities in the country and will 
reduce inequalities in regional development. 
  Finally, the analysis says that focusing on areas where we 
are behind, deregulating various areas, allowing private capital 
to play a more active role with the public sector, improving 
regulations, and expanding channeled fiscal resources are key 
factors in modernizing the infrastructure to strengthen Mexico's 
competitive position in the international community.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Mexican elections, 
scheduled for 21 August 1994. 
  Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, campaign manager for 
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, of the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, is quoted in the "Mexico 
and NAFTA Report" published by the LATIN AMERICAN NEWSLETTERS in 
London. Zedillo said that for the first time, the PRI will be 
facing a true challenge in the elections. "We will have to 
attain full credibility," he said adding that the party "will be 
judged much harder than other political parties." (Madrid EFE in 
Spanish 1610 GMT 17 Feb 94) 
  Colosio on 17 February visited Chilpancingo, Guerrero State, 
where he met with PRI members. Colosio told them that his main 
commitment is "to struggle decisively against inequality." 
(Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 18 Feb

  Colosio on 18 February met with small scale entrepreneurs of 
Mexico City and offered them a nine-point plan that will promote 
associations, training programs, loan programs, and tax 
programs. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 
GMT 19 Feb 94) 
  National Action Party, PAN, presidential candidate Diego 
Fernandez visited Toluca and met with Mexico State businessmen. 
Fernandez told them that "with or without changes to the 
Electoral Law, the 21 August elections will be clean elections." 
He added that he is opposed to the "coalitions that parties 
such as the Party of the Democratic Revolution, PRD, are trying 
to make." (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 
GMT 18 Feb 94) 
  Fernandez also visited Veracruz and clarified that the 
government must comply with the law, but candidates and the 
political parties must also be serious and honest if Mexico is 
to have clean elections. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in 
Spanish 0435 GMT 19 Feb 94) 
  PRD presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas visited 
Durango State where he held a news conference with the local 
media to reiterate his request "for an extraordinary meeting of 
the Congress of the Union to make changes to the Electoral Law." 
Cardenas also said that he would like to meet with PRI 
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio and "define the 
necessary measures for changes to the Electoral Law and to 
discuss the Chiapas armed conflict." (Mexico City XEW Television 
Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 18 Feb 94) 
  Cardenas also attended a rally in the Durango main plaza and 
spoke of the struggle "to seek a democratic change in the 
nation." As part of his program, he proposed the "economic 
recovery of the country." (Mexico City XEW Television Network in 
Spanish 0435 GMT 19 Feb 94) 
  Rafael Aguilar, presidential candidate for the Cardenist 
Front for National Reconstruction Party, PFCRN, visited Tlaxcala 
State on 17 February. Aguilar said that his party is undergoing 
"a process of tripling its forces, and this proves that by April 
it will have reached its goal of signing up 1 million members." 
(Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 18 Feb 
94) 
  In Veracruz, Aguilar pointed out that the elections are the 
only path for obtaining the democratic change all Mexicans need. 
In a news conference, the PFCRN candidate stated all 
presidential candidates seek honest and clean elections. (Mexico 
City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 19 Feb 94) 
  Alvaro Perez Trevino, presidential candidate of the 
Authentic 
Party of the Mexican Revolution, PARM, met with party members in 
Naucalpan. Perez said that "to combat voting abstentions, it is 
necessary to encourage women and youths to vote since they 
represent 70 percent of the country's population." (Mexico City 
XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 18 Feb 94) 
  Pablo Emilio Madero, National Opposition Union, UNO, 
presidential candidate, visited Michoacan State where he met 
with reporters. Madero stressed the importance of clean 
elections that "will serve as an example for future elections." 
(Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 18 Feb 
94) 
  Mexican Green Ecologist Party presidential candidate Jorge 
Gonzalez Torres has visited Michoacan State where he met with 
professors who are on strike at the local university. (Mexico 
City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 18 Feb 94) 
  While in Mexico City, Gonzalez Torres accepted an invitation 
to attend the Chiapas peace dialogue as an observer at the 
invitation of the peace commission and the mediator. (Mexico 
City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 19 Feb 94) 
  The weekly magazine ESTE PAIS on 18 February reported on a 
poll conducted in Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara, Tijuana, 
and Merida on 11 February. The poll showed that 35 percent of 
the people do not know for whom they are going to vote, 33 
percent said they will vote for Colosio, 17 percent will vote 
for Fernandez, and 14 percent will vote for Cardenas. 
Meanwhile, 40 percent of those polled said they do not believe 
their votes will be respected. (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network 
in Spanish 0030 GMT 19 Feb 94)

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 25 Feb (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
supported Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo when he said that the 
latter is "one of the key people in his government program." He 
made it clear that "in case of emergency, there are always 
courageous and talented people who can take on the 
responsibility" of heading the Finance Ministry. 
  The head of state endorsed his minister on 24 February, a 
day 
on which financial markets were in turmoil and share prices on 
the stock exchange plunged as a result of insistent rumors of 
Cavallo's resignation and other technical reasons. 
  Menem's comment was like an analgesic on the tense 
atmosphere 
at the stock exchange and prevented shares from plummeting 
further. 
  Menem played down the importance of the decline in stock 
prices, stating: "This is not the first time the market has been 
bearish." 
  The president, speaking on Radio America, noted: "There is 
invariably speculation on ways to reap greater profits. A 
bearish market enables those who want to buy stocks to get them 
cheaper." 
  He once again remarked that the continuity of the present 
economic model is not tied to those in charge of implementing 
the economic policy. 
  The head of state said he always keeps a name "in pectore," 
ready to replace each of his cabinet members if need be. 
  Cavallo's case is no different from any other, even though 
he 
is considered to be the "almighty" person within the government. 
  Rumors of Cavallo's resignation affected stock exchange 
trading on 23 February, when blue chips dropped by more than 5 
percent. 
  The economy minister has had to withstand several attacks 
over the last few days. San Isidro Federal Judge Roberto 
Marquevich, for example, accused him of "interfering" in the 
case of the Opalsen firm -- linked to businessman Francisco 
Macri -- which allegedly failed to pay duties on the importation 
of 15,000 cars. 
  When Cavallo questioned several aspects of the proceedings, 
Judge Marquevich charged the executive branch with "meddling" in 
the judiciary. 
  The spectacular operations conducted by the DGI [General 
Directorate of Taxation] especially among the "rich and famous" 
caused friction between Cavallo and his influential Public 
Revenues Secretary Carlos Tacchi, who is held in high respect in 
business circles for his struggle against tax evasion. 
  Cavallo questioned the methodology used by DGI agents -- the 
director of which is Ricardo Cossio -- stating that Luis Maria 
Pena, the head of the fiscal auditing office, had committed 
"excesses" during the investigations. 
  Cavallo subsequently supported DGI agents, but demanded that 
they be more restrained and observe confidentiality in their 
operations. 
  Now that the alleged fraudulent importation by Sevel has 
been 
brought in the open, the protection of the Argentine car 
industry has also come under fire. 
  Some economists have voiced their opposition to an 
indefinite 
continuation of this protectionist policy and found that Cavallo 
is willing to defend it to the bitter end. 
  He crashed headlong into Dardo Gasparre and Miguel Angel 
Broda on two occasions, labelling them and other economists as 
"market fundamentalists." 
  Cavallo attacked Broda by bringing to light an old incident 
of disloyalty within the government. 
  He recalled that in 1991, the then Finance Secretary Saul 
Bouer told Broda that the government was going to pay overdue 
securities. The latter interpreted this as an increase in the 
money supply, and therefore, a form of devaluation. 
  Bouer demanded a public apology, with which the minister 
complied by issuing a press communique that cleared the good 
reputation of the incumbent mayor. 
  These conflicts obliged President Menem to put Cavallo in 
his 
place during a cabinet meeting. 
  He reportedly told the minister: "In politics, peppery 
people 
lose out." 
  All these events led people to surmise that Cavallo was 
going 
to resign, which in turn had an adverse effect on financial 
markets.

  [Excerpts] Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem begins a 
three-day official visit to Spain today. He had to postpone the 
visit twice: first because of the death of Don Juan de Borbon 
[King Juan Carlos's father] and then because of the heart attack 
he suffered. [passage omitted] 
  Jose Manuel Martin Meden reports on this visit: 
  [Martin Meden] [Passage omitted] Menem arrives in Madrid 
with 
his political horizon clear after the agreement with the 
opposition for a constitutional reform that will enable him to 
be re-elected and to govern until the year 2000 if he wins a 
majority in 1995. In statements for Radiotelevision Espanola, 
the president of Argentina confirms his good health and his 
readiness to continue as president. 
  [Begin Menem recording] I am much better than before the 
operation. I shall face it with the same passion, the same 
enthusiasm, the same spirit with which I have done everything in 
my life and, of course, with a small quantity of ability. [end 
recording] 
  [Martin Meden] [Passage omitted] President Menem says that 
he 
is convinced that, through negotiation, in the year 2000 the 
Malvinas [Falkland] Islands will be Argentine again. 
  [Begin Menem recording] I have the intuition -- and in 
intuition there is also some share of of intelligence, of wisdom 
-- that in the year 2000 the Malvinas Islands will be in the 
possession of Argentina again. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] [Announcer] Argentine President Carlos Menem arrived 
in Spain at a few minutes after 1000 [0900 GMT] for a four-day 
official visit to our country. At Barajas airport, President 
Menem made his first statements on Spanish soil, and our 
colleague Hector Arenas has them. Good morning. 
  [Arenas] Good morning. I am happy to be in Spain, a country 
that I learned about beginning with my childhood, said Argentine 
President Carlos Menem on his arrival in Madrid. He said that 
Spanish investment in Argentina has doubled, and is expected to 
exceed $6 billion in the next few years. As for the purchase of 
a further share in Aerolineas Argentinas by Iberia, Menem told 
Radio Nacional that it is practically resolved and that there 
will be a solution. 
  [Begin Menem recording] Practically everything is completed 
between Spain and Argentina. Some instruments have to be 
improved. Things are going very well; there are no problems.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 26 Feb (NA) -- Felipe Sola, 
agriculture, livestock, and fishing secretary, today stated that 
the government "will not remain indifferent to the outrage" 
caused by the Mexican Government's decision to forbid the import 
of some Argentine agricultural products. 
  Sola has asked the Foreign Ministry to "urgently" convey a 
protest to the Mexican Government, and to demand that the 
measure be revoked. 
  On 16 February the Mexican Agriculture and Hydraulic 
Resources Secretariat banished the import of rice, wheat, 
garlic, and peanuts from Argentina for health reasons, although 
this decision was not officially reported to Buenos Aires. 
  In a communique Sola stated: "We are confronting a serious 
nontariff restriction to commerce, which sets a very bad 
precedent for future commercial relations." 
  He said: "The argument of plagues and diseases is nothing 
new for Argentina, and the measure is technically groundless 
considering that most of them also affect Mexico." 
  He added: "Mexico imports these products from other 
countries such as the United States, which is also stricken by 
the same plagues." 
  Sola believes that "the Mexican Agricultural Secretariat's 
attitude is dishonest" and added: "I cannot understand either 
the measure or its implementation, as under the same criteria 
Mexico should have already suspended the import of a great 
number of products from the United States." 
  He noted that should this measure persist, the export of 
rice, peanuts, and garlic projected for this year will be harmed. 
  The measure worsens the situation for wheat because of the 
U.S. and Canadian decision to subsidize its sales.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 25 Feb (NA) -- Through the Ministry of 
Foreign Relations and Worship, the Argentine Government today 
"strongly condemned" the massacre of Palestinians in Hebron. 
  In an official communique the Foreign Ministry states that 
the attack was "all the more repugnant because it was 
perpetrated against innocent victims at a place intended for 
prayer." 
  The communique also "calls upon all the parties to this 
conflict to act with prudence and conciliation to avoid further 
bloodshed," and calls for compliance with the agreements entered 
into by Israel and the Palestinian leaders as "as the only way 
to achieve a lasting, genuine peace" in the Middle East. 
  The communique concludes by conveying the Argentine 
Government's "heartfelt condolences to relatives of the victims 
of this tragic event."

<F P=106> [Report by William Melendez from the "Up to Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Presidency Minister Oscar Santamaria has revealed 
the government has uncovered a plan to attack political leaders, 
as was disclosed yesterday by FMLN [Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front] leader Francisco Jovel. Minister Santamaria 
said the information available is still vague, but he added that 
those who might be targeted have already been alerted. 
  Minister Santamaria said the government abides by the 
principles of respecting human rights and rejecting violence, 
and, therefore, it is illogical to think any government official 
is involved in the recent attack against the bodyguards of FMLN 
candidate Nidia Diaz. Santamaria stressed that whenever the 
government has received information of this nature, it has 
warned those who might be targeted. 
  [Begin Santamaria recording] I believe no one could receive 
this kind of information without reporting it, because it would 
be tragic if anything happened to a person who could have been 
alerted. [end recording] 
  Santamaria said in light of the fact that the information 
received is sometimes sketchy, it is difficult to arrest the 
people reportedly involved in plans to attack political figures. 
  [Begin Santamaria recording] When a person is arrested, the 
arrest has to be based on evidence and not on simple information 
that cannot be used as a basis for detention. In addition, we 
have taken other measures. [end recording] 
  According to Santamaria, whenever the FMLN has asked for 
assistance from government organizations, it has received 
assistance without any problems. He recalled that the 
Investigations Division of the National Civilian Police is 
investigating the attack on Nidia Diaz's bodyguards.

<F P=106> [Report by Imelda Alvarenga; from the "Facing the Moment" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Jorge Martinez, Unity Movement presidential 
candidate, expressed disagreement on Wednesday with the Onusal 
[UN Observer Mission in El Salvador] Electoral Division's 
assessment that the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] registry is 
satisfactory. The Electoral Division's second report terms as 
satisfactory the voter registry even though approximately 60,000 
persons will not be able to vote for lack of a voter 
identification card. 
  [Begin Martinez recording] We consider the TSE's response to 
be insufficient. Too many people have been left without their 
voter identification cards. Tens of thousands of people who are 
registered to vote have been denied the right to be told why 
they will not get their voter identification cards. They are 
simply not given one. It is also said a large number of citizens 
requested their voter identification cards but their data was 
lost in the computers' memories. We believe things could have 
been improved. [end recording] 
  Furthermore, the Unity Movement candidate criticized ARENA 
[Nationalist Republican Alliance] for using state resources in 
its campaign. [Begin Martinez recording] The media has been 
invaded by the government with a shameless electoral publicity 
in favor of ARENA. In fact, state-owned presses, like the one at 
the National Geographic Institute, have been printing political 
propaganda for ARENA. This has been reported by the workers. 
[end recording] 
  Finally, Jorge Martinez announced that municipal government 
plans are being discussed with different candidates throughout 
the country. Martinez said his party's main strategy will be to 
sponsor the citizens' participation through open town council 
meetings.

  [Text] San Salvador, 25 Feb (DPA) -- Nine inmates have died 
as the result of a prison riot in El Salvador, the Justice 
Ministry officially reported today. 
  The riot took place in Penitenciaria de Occidente, located 
in 
Santa Ana, 68 km west of San Salvador. The commotion among the 
inmates broke out Wednesday night with two dead initially. The 
situation was aggravated yesterday morning when the resident 
inmates rejected the presence of others who had been transferred 
from Gotera Prison in the east, where they had participated in a 
massacre last November. 
  It was reported that the Occidente inmates demanded the 
retransfer of the rioters, who caused the deaths of two of their 
group on Wednesday night. After the riot ended last night with 
the mediation of the UN Observer Mission in El Salvador, Onusal, 
prison system director Rodolfo Garay Pineda reported nine dead, 
six of whom had been beheaded by the old Santa Ana inmates. 
  The riot concluded after negotiations were held to 
retransfer 
the dangerous inmates and after inmate committees cooperated by 
agreeing to surrender the knives and ice picks used in the riot.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Salvadoran elections, 
scheduled for 20 March 1994. Dr. Ruben Zamora, presidential 
candidate for the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front-Democratic Convergence-National Revolutionary Movement, 
FMLN-CD-MNR, coalition, said in a speech to the Salvadoran 
Chamber of Construction Industry that the country needs a policy 
to give every Salvadoran a dignified home. "We believe more 
emphasis should be placed on providing the necessary funds for 
low-cost homes," he said. (San Salvador Canal Doce Television in 
Spanish 0300 GMT 16 Feb 94) 
  Zamora said the government's indifference toward the 
investigation of corruption cases proves its complicity. He 
said the government "is guilty of a cover-up in connection with 
all these cases" because "the committee appointed to 
investigate" the cases did nothing. Zamora said the U.S. 
Congress decision to freeze $20 million in aid is a result of 
the current Salvadoran Government's failure to investigate the 
cases and punish the culprits. (San Salvador Canal Doce 
Television in Spanish 0300 GMT 23 Feb 94) 
  The FMLN Womens Group on 23 February presented their 
platform 
to the leftist coalition, demanding greater participation in the 
party and the government, free health care and education, and 
equal pay for equal work. The women proposed the creation of a 
women's ministry to protect women's interests. (San Salvador 
Canal Doce Television in Spanish 0300 GMT 24 Feb 94) 
  All the presidential candidates' platforms include promises 
to solve water, health, education, crime, and economic problems. 
Nationalist Republican Alliance, Arena, candidate Armando 
Calderon Sol stressed the peace achieved by the Cristiani 
Government will be consolidated when his ticket is elected. 
Christian Democratic Party, PDC, candidate Fidel Chavez Mena 
said he will change the direction of the economy, freeze prices, 
and eliminate the Value Added Tax. FMLN-CD-MNR coalition 
candidate Ruben Zamora said farmers will have access to credit, 
all the villages will have potable water, crime will be 
controlled, and the government will fight corruption. National 
Conciliation Party, PCN, candidate Roberto Escobar Garcia 
claimed the most important projects were carried out during the 
PCN administration; adding the same will be done during his 
administration. National Solidarity Movement candidate Edgardo 
Rodriguez Engelhardt said he supports a decentralized government 
with more local autonomy. (San Salvador LA PRENSA GRAFICA in 
Spanish 21 Feb 94 p 3) 
  Approximately 26,000 demobilized Armed Forces members 
threatened to obstruct the upcoming elections if a series of 
irregularities concerning the payment of their compensations is 
not corrected soon. They claimed the government played a dirty 
trick because their documents state they have abandoned their 
posts. This has caused great discontent among the demobilized 
men, who are prepared to take up arms again and fight for their 
rights. (San Salvador Canal Doce Television in Spanish 0300 GMT 
24 Feb 94) 
  The UN Observers for El Salvador, Onusal, reported today 
400,000 Salvadoran citizens will not vote in the 20 March 
elections although their names appear on the electoral lists. 
Supreme Electoral Tribunal President Luis Zaldivar questioned 
the veracity of the report because, in his opinion, no one can 
predict how many people will vote in the next general elections. 
The voters' registration list shows 2.7 million people are 
registered to vote, but the Onusal report said the list should 
have been purged because it includes people who live abroad and 
others who never showed up to claim their electoral card. (San 
Salvador Canal Doce Television in Spanish 0300 GMT 24 Feb 94)

  [Text] Guatemala City, 25 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio and the Armed Forces recently 
managed to control an alleged plot planned by soldiers and 
civilians to force the head of state's resignation, the magazine 
CRONICA reported today. 
  According to CRONICA, which cited military sources, Fernando 
Andrade, former foreign minister during the military government 
headed by Oscar Mejia (1983-86) was the one who tried to force 
the president's resignation so that Vice President Arturo 
Herbruger, for whom he worked as adviser until a few days ago, 
could assume the post. The report added that Andrade's 
intention was promoting Herbruger's enthronement and then having 
Congress declare him incapacitated in order to leave the 
Presidency vacant. 
  According to the sources, members of the Armed Forces knew 
about the alleged plot since October. The report added that 
Andrade contacted General Jose Luis Quilo Ayuso, who was removed 
from his post as national defense chief of staff on 18 February; 
former President Vinicio Cerezo (1986-91); and Central American 
Parliament Deputy Danilo Roca, the lawyer who represents the 
soldiers who tried to overthrow Cerezo. 
  Military Intelligence learned about the plan, as well as 
Israeli and U.S. diplomats, who alerted President De Leon of a 
possible attack against him. 
  Nevertheless, Andrade, former foreign minister (1983-86) and 
former ambassador to the OAS and the United Nations, today 
denied any participation in the alleged plot, stating that he 
presented his resignation to Herbruger in December, but it was 
not accepted until February. "I find those rumors very funny," 
Andrade said, dismissing the possibility that his resignation 
was due to his presumed implication in the plot. 
  Roca, a member of the Union of the National Center (UCN), 
also denied the allegations, saying that "the soldiers I 
represent were discharged." "Should I get involved in something 
like this, you will see me at the National Palace, and not 
talking about an aborted coup," Roca stressed. 
  Meanwhile, during a ceremony also attended by President De 
Leon, Gen. Quilo Ayuso today denied any links to any 
"conspiracy" as "some people are cynically saying." With regard 
to rumors about coups d'etat, President De Leon has constantly 
said that they are "just rumors," and that the changes he made 
in the Army on 18 February had nothing to do with presumed 
movements of that nature. "It is said that some people with 
coupist intentions have participated in those activities and 
that there have been meetings among them, but there is no 
evidence," President De Leon said.

unidentified reporter at the farewell ceremony for General Jose 
Luis Quilo Ayuso, former chief of the general staff of national 
defense, at the former Polytechnic School in Guatemala City on 
25 February; broadcast in progress -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [De Leon]...bureaucrats for a 40-percent increase 
when 8 million Guatemalans have no job, nothing to eat, no 
health care, and no education. That is why I listen to the 
Guatemalan people. With the law in our hands, we are going to 
continue working. 
  [Reporter] You said on one occasion that you were being 
pressured into resigning? 
  [De Leon] No, no, no, I have never been pressured. I 
sometimes have high blood pressure because of all the obstacles 
I must face. There is no pressure. I cannot resign. How could 
I resign a popular mandate? How would I stand? I have a huge 
challenge ahead. I do not think it would be wrong for me to say 
that I have been the Guatemalan president who came to the 
presidency under the worst conditions in the country's history, 
facing huge challenges, an economic crisis, and a political 
crisis that we are now overcoming. We have also faced a social 
crisis. I boarded a ship sailing rough waters in the middle of 
a hurricane. We are now sailing away from the hurricane, and I 
have to turn it over to my successor in peaceful waters or at a 
safe port. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [De Leon] We are doing well at the international level. They 
are aware of our efforts. They are aware of the political 
commitment of the president and my administration. In that 
regard, it is logical for this to happen. If the human rights 
situation deteriorated, it would be logical for them to think 
that way. We are going to wait for the Geneva resolution. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [De Leon] I prefer not to comment. Draw your own 
conclusions. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] as for human rights violations 
reported in Mexico [words indistinct]. 
  [De Leon] Many things are said abroad. I would like them to 
say those things here in Guatemala. Here is where we have to 
rebuild Guatemala. Here is where we have to build peace. It is 
not going to be done outside Guatemala. Those who are here, 
those of us who have suffered the consequences of the armed 
confrontation that has lasted over 30 years, we are the ones who 
must truly assume that responsibility, and we have assumed it. 
To be saying in Mexico that we are violating human 
rights....[pauses] We must ask these people if they know where 
Santiago Atitlan is. We must ask them how many years it has 
been since they were here. I do not know, they may have been 
here before but under different circumstances. Thank you. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [De Leon] We have already begun paying state workers 
according to the schedule. Of course we are not going to pay 
those who were involved in the (?strike), and there is proof of 
that.

<F P=106> [Interview with Guatemalan Defense Minister General Mario </F>
Rene Enriquez Morales by unidentified reporters on 22 February; 
place not given; from the "Telepress" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] On 22 February, Defense Minister General Mario 
Enriquez Morales stated he would defend, with his own life, 
constitutional order, and expressed his belief that there are 
people interested in disrupting the country's institutions. 
Enriquez Morales made this statement when asked about the recent 
changes in the so-called security cabinet, particularly the 
high-ranking military positions. 
  [Enriquez] I believe the changes in the Army, as rightly 
said 
by Gen. Gonzalez Paracena on the commemoration of Tecun Uman's 
Day, are routine and we should get used to changes of that sort. 
Normally, posts are rotated and changes made each month. When 
these changes are implemented at a higher level, however, there 
is always some apprehension. I can tell you, however, that there 
is nothing extraordinary about these changes, which seek to 
strengthen the Army as an institution. 
  [Reporter] Are destabilization attempts the cause for these 
changes? 
  [Enriquez] The truth is we have been hearing rumors of a 
coup 
d'etat, destabilization, instability, and ungovernability for a 
long time. It seems to me that some people, individually or as a 
sector, would be pleased if the constitutional order were 
broken. As the defense minister, I want to let everyone know 
that I would defend the constitutional order with my own life if 
necessary. In addition, the officers of the Guatemalan Army are 
already very aware that one of their main roles is to preserve 
the constitutional order. I do not want to mention the 25 May 
and 1 June events again, but they truly exemplify the Army's new 
attitude. 
  I have also said the democratic process will not be 
consolidated by imposing a dictatorship in Guatemala, which is 
what many might want. A democratic system may not be perfect, 
but it has been proven to be the best system. The problem is 
that we have not learned yet to live in a democracy. Sometimes, 
we confuse democracy with excess freedom. The reason there are 
protests by many sectors of the population is because we demand 
only rights and forget our obligations. 
  [Reporter] What are [words indistinct] that the president 
mentioned, such as [word indistinct] the country's institutions, 
strengthen the Army's unity, and he also mentioned kidnappings? 
  [Enriquez] I have told you that we must strengthen the 
institutions, and the president, with every reason, has been 
very concerned with the inefficiency of the work done by the 
security cabinet. A case in point is the resignation of 
Government Minister Ortiz Moscoso, to whom I send my regards and 
respect. He is a very good and kind person. 
  It seems there was somewhat of a lack of coordination which 
hurt the security the state must provide its citizens. You are 
aware that the rate of kidnappings has increased abruptly, many 
estates have been invaded and war taxes imposed. In addition, 
some social sectors of the country have suffered disappointments 
and been disillusioned when they saw that the state's response 
did not conform with their expectations or has not been the 
appropriate response. As a result, the president must make his 
decisions, which, although political in nature, benefit the 
population in general. 
  [Reporter] Did this lack of coordination you mentioned take 
place in the National Defense General Staff? 
  [Enriquez] No, it occurred in the security cabinet. I 
believe 
there was somewhat of a lack of coordination between the 
security forces and the Government Ministry, which affected the 
security cabinet. This was not the reason for General Quilo's 
removal however. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Enriquez] Gen. Quilo is retiring. He will have his farewell 
party and leave with all the honors. I believe the president's 
decision regarding the removal of Gen. Quilo is reasonable. Gen. 
Quilo is a very good friend of mine. 
  [Reporter] Would you recommend a military member for the 
Government Ministry? 
  [Enriquez] I believe any citizen who is capable of 
fulfilling 
the duties of that position would be eligible. The candidate 
must also inspire security given the current situation of 
uneasiness and disquiet that stems mainly from the high crime 
rates in Guatemala. That a military member might become 
president is not so farfetched because it is the right of any 
citizen. It could be a military member who has retired or 
resigned, or it could be a civilian, which is what I tend to 
believe the most probable. 
  [Reporter] Could the Army propose a candidate? 
  [Gen. Enriquez] The Army should not recommend candidates for 
civilian positions. I believe the Army would be wrong to 
recommend anyone to the president because he already knows many 
people who can cooperate with him. If at any time, however, the 
president asks for advice, we would be willing to comply in a 
very institutional manner. 
  [Reporter] What is your opinion on the article published in 
THE MIAMI HERALD, which argues that the president and the Army 
are very close? 
  [Enriquez] You must see that they have always said that. You 
must recall that former President Vinicio Cerezo, in his 
campaign, used to say the Army should return to its barracks, 
and after his victory, Cerezo was accused of being too close to 
the Army. This should not surprise anyone. The Army is a 
disciplined and obedient institution. Once one becomes familiar 
with the Army, one gives it the credibility and the respect it 
deserves for its loyalty to the institutions, the president, and 
the entire democratic system it defends. I repeat, we still have 
a long way to go to consolidate our democracy. 
  [Reporter] Reports have said the Army was going to cooperate 
in the investigation of some kidnappings. Are there any clues so 
far; what investigations have been conducted? 
  [Enriquez] I believe the Army is cooperating through the 
Intelligence Directorate, and it is participating in joint 
actions with this purpose in mind, specifically in the case of 
Jorge Carpio Nicolle, although we have many problems in 
Guatemala such as kidnappings, war taxes, estates invasions, and 
robberies. 
  This case, however, is special and has caused a stir 
worldwide because it involved Carpio Nicolle, who was not only a 
professional but also a former presidential candidate, and the 
owner of EL GRAFICO newspaper. All cases are dealt with in the 
same manner, but regarding this particular case, I believe the 
president's decision to appoint representatives from various 
sectors to investigate this crime is the right one. [end

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by Guatemalan President Ramiro de </F>
Leon Carpio with unidentified reporters at the National Palace 
in Guatemala City on 22 February; from the "Telepress" 
newscast-- recorded] 
  [Text] In a statement to reporters at the National Palace 
on 22 February, President Ramiro de Leon Carpio commented on the 
variations in fuel prices. He initially answered questions from 
reporters who asked him about the appointment of a new 
government minister after accepting current Minister Arnoldo 
Ortiz Moscoso 's resignation this week. De Leon said he has not 
yet decided who will be the new government minister. 
  [Begin recording] [De Leon] I do not know yet. 
  [Reporter] When will the announcement be made? 
  [De Leon] When I have the name. I have not decided yet. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [De Leon] Yes, of course he will assume his post at that 
time, but I still do not know. 
  [Reporter] Any candidates? 
  [De Leon] No, not yet. 
  [Reporter] What will be the basis for selection? 
  [De Leon] The president will make the decision based on the 
requirements, qualifications, personal qualities, and so forth. 
  [Reporter] Will he be another civilian? 
  [De Leon] We still do not know. 
  [Reporter] What are your comments on the article published 
by THE MIAMI HERALD and the current situation of 
nongovernability? 
  [De Leon] I would like to refer to a commentary written by 
one of your colleagues, which was published today, in the sense 
that sometimes a foreign reporter visits our country for a few 
minutes and then believes he is an expert in our national 
affairs. Carlos Rafael Soto said this, not me. This is what he 
said in his column today. 
  I believe we can handle our internal affairs better, more 
knowledgeably. The article stated I depend on the Army and that 
the Army is pressuring me. Maybe we should inform the person 
who wrote the article about the changes we made on 18 February, 
so he can see differently. I am not concerned about the 
article, because I feel it is not consonant with reality. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] at the international level? 
  [De Leon] None at all. 
  [Reporter] What would be the impact of an increase in the 
price of diesel? 
  [De Leon] I am pleased to say a few days ago I was 
criticized 
when I said I would not increase the price of gasoline and that 
instead it was possible the price of the two types of gasoline 
would drop. Based on the economic theory of free supply and 
demand and free market, I then said we had to wait. Today, 10 
or 12 days later, what I said is right. I did not lie. I said 
the price of gasoline would drop. 
  It is significant that gas stations that did not increase 
the 
price of gasoline by 10 cents possibly doubled their sales, 
according to statistics. The economic theory did work. 
Concerning diesel, what happened was logical; nevertheless, as 
I said, this compensates for the lower prices in the two types 
of gasoline. Prices have dropped considerably, 30 or 40 cents. 
I did not lie; on the contrary, I told the truth. Liberalizing 
the price of fuel can benefit consumers at a given time, once 
the market reaches its natural levels. 
  [Reporter] Certain private hospitals have offered their 
assistance due to the public hospitals strike. Will you accept 
that proposal? Could the military hospital also help? 
  [De Leon] Any type of assistance is welcome, especially when 
the people's human rights are being violated, in this case, the 
human right to health, which the Constitution guarantees. Those 
who earn a salary to give medical attention--sometimes 
deficiently due to lack of funds, medicines, and proper 
conditions--are giving an even more deficient service today. We 
do not know if this can be called a service when there is an 
illegal strike, a totally illegal strike; hence, in addition to 
the disciplinary actions, the administrative, and legal actions 
we are conducting, naturally any assistance is welcome. If 
doctors and paramedics in private hospitals are willing to 
reduce the harm being done to the Guatemalan people, I welcome 
their assistance. I respect them, because they are honoring 
their Hippocratic oath, showing their humanitarian spirit; they 
deserve praise and recognition. 
  Nevertheless, we must act. I met with members of the 
Association of Hospital Directors yesterday and will continue to 
meet with them in an attempt to find medium- and long-term 
solutions. One of those solutions is having family foundations 
[patronatos familiares] take care of the direction and 
administration of hospitals in the future. There are already 
very good examples of how this can work. 
  We will expedite the procedures for approximately 100 or 120 
foundations that have already requested their registration and 
recognition of their legal status. In the future, this will 
result in the decentralization of administrative functions, and 
this type of problem will be solved via social participation and 
supervision. For this to happen we must first take care of 
certain administrative aspects. In the meantime, we will try to 
resolve certain financial problems, but the administrative 
aspect and handling of hospitals is a different problem. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [De Leon] I have not thought of that yet, but as I said, any 
assistance is welcome. If this is possible, if the military 
hospital and the doctors of the military hospital can help, we 
would use those services. [end recording]

  [Text] Guatemala City, 27 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- The Guatemalan 
Government and Army today rejected the "ultimatum" given by the 
Belizean authorities to 18 Guatemalan families who have been 
ordered to withdraw from lands they are occupying. 
  According to the Belizean Embassy, the peasants, who have 
established themselves in the "Chiquibul" national park, have 
been given 15 days to clear the area with a deadline that 
expires on 10 March. 
  Guatemalan Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz said Guatemala does 
not acknowledge the Belizean Government's authority to give 
alleged "ultimatums" to Guatemalan families living in border 
areas. 
  Guatemalan Defense Minister General Mario Rene Enriquez 
asserted that the Army will not tolerate any "meddling" on 
Belize's part in Guatemala's national sovereignty, much less the 
"intimidation" of Guatemalan citizens. 
  Enriquez added that the Belizean authorities are "being 
unreasonable" and that they cannot set deadlines for families to 
abandon the area in question because Guatemala still disputes 
ownership of that territory. 
  Belize gained its independence from Great Britain in 
September 1981, and the administration of deposed Guatemalan 
President Jorge Serrano (1991-1993) recognized it as a state. 
However, Guatemala has maintained its claim on the region for 
over a century and a half. 
  The defense minister said the Army is prepared to support 
the 
Guatemalan families living in the "Chiquibul" national park, 
where they have built their homes. Enriquez dismissed the 
possibility of clashes with Belizean soldiers.

  [Text] Major Edith Vargas de Marroquin, Armed Forces 
spokesperson, said the Army respects but does not share the 
opinion of Human Rights Ombudsman Jorge Mario Garcia Laguardia 
regarding the need to repeal Decree Law 19-86, which recognizes 
the existence of the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols (PAC). 
  Vargas reaffirmed that the PAC have spearheaded 
counterinsurgency activity in the countryside. In this context, 
the existence of the PAC is fully justified, not only for that 
reason but also because they provide security for the 
inhabitants. 
  She explained that in areas where there is no guerrilla 
threat, the PAC are becoming Peace and Development Committees. 
These committees help bring progress to their communities. 
  Vargas admitted that some patrol members have committed 
human 
rights violations, as Garcia Laguardia had previously stated. 
She said, however, that such cases have been put in the hands 
of the law. 
  The military spokesperson reaffirmed that there is no 
obligation to participate in the PAC. She said the document 
filed by the human rights ombudsman at the National Congress 
requesting the repeal of this decree-law should be examined 
under the same light in which the decree itself was originally 
issued.

  [Text] General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, Armed Forces 
commander in chief, yesterday hinted that he is trying to help 
President Carlos Roberto Reina so he does not fall short on his 
campaign promise to eliminate obligatory military service. 
  During an interview following a meeting at the Foreign 
Relations Ministry, the general said that a "mixed" volunteer 
military service is being studied under which some "would be 
obliged" to serve. 
  Discua Elvir said he met with the president on Monday to 
analyze the last proposal that he, as commander in chief, 
presented on 10 February to establish "constitutional military 
service." 
  The general said he is waiting for the government's response 
to this proposal because "the president's political objective is 
to solve this issue, which has been a problem for the Armed 
Forces, the government, and the Honduran people. We hope there 
is a desire to recruit soldiers in a more humane manner." 
  Immediately after the meeting, the commander in chief was 
asked if military service would remain obligatory. He replied: 
"We have neither the economic nor cultural capacity for an 
all-volunteer military service." 
  Discua Elvir said only four nations in the world have 
volunteer military services. "We want to have a mixed military 
service in which there are both volunteers and those who will be 
obligated to serve," he noted. 
  The general added: "We are trying to organize a mixed 
military service because a volunteer service is very expensive. 
Even if we reduced the number of personnel to a quarter of its 
present size, the Armed Forces budget would triple." 
  Discua was then reminded that the Armed Forces is 
contradicting President Carlos Roberto Reina's campaign promise 
to have a "volunteer and educational military service." 
  "I am afraid that at that time the president did not have 
advisers. Sometimes advice is not correct; maybe that was the 
case. Nevertheless, the president is doing everything possible. 
He must be given time. He definitely wants to keep his 
promise, and we -- who must help with ideas -- are cooperating 
as much as possible so he can find a solution to keep his 
promise." 
  The general insisted that the new recruitment system will 
not 
discriminate and include only the sons of the poor. He 
explained that other options, such as students serving on 
weekends, are being studied. 
  We are trying to do this "in an acceptable manner" so those 
who want to remain in the battalions can choose technical 
careers or receive special training as forest rangers, 
mechanics, and so forth. This would also include social services 
such as painting schools, sweeping streets, and other 
activities, he noted. 
  Discua Elvir indicated that a plan will be coordinated with 
Education Minister Zenobia Rodas whereby all officers will help 
teach illiterate residents living around the battalions -- to be 
identified by a census -- to read and write.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Gautama Fonseca: "The North Americans and </F>
Our Right"] 
  [Text] The media have been reporting several land ownership 
litigations involving U.S. citizens are being heard in our 
national courts. 
  They have also disclosed the U.S. Embassy in Honduras 
released a note on 18 February stating "a delegation consisting 
of two personnel of the U.S. Senate" are visiting our country to 
learn about the cases in question. 
  The same media also reported Senator Jesse Helms is 
sponsoring amendments to the internal legislation of his country 
"to exclude from foreign aid any state that 1) Has prior to, 
during, or after the amendment: a) Nationalized or expropriated 
any property that belongs to a U.S. citizen; b) Relinquished or 
annulled any contract or agreement with a U.S. citizen; or c) 
Taken any other action (such as levying discriminatory taxes or 
others) aimed at seizing or controlling property of a U.S. 
citizen. 2) Has failed to give adequate and effective 
compensation for the property within a three-year period. Such 
a compensation must be effected in convertible currency 
equivalent to the total value of the property as required by 
international law." 
  Disregarding the peculiar language of the translation, it 
seems to us our government must carefully study this type of 
news, because they do not necessarily agree with that that is 
stated in our Constitution or with the rules of Public 
International Law or Private International Law which we have to 
follow. 
  It is a known fact to everyone that Article 30 of the 
Constitution states "Foreigners must respect authorities and 
abide by the law from the moment they enter national territory." 
Article 33 establishes that "Foreigners cannot lodge a complaint 
or demand compensation from the state in any other way or case 
that Hondurans can." 
  It also stipulates foreigners "will not resort to diplomatic 
channels except when justice is denied (and that) to that 
effect, the fact a sentence is not favorable to the person 
filing the complaint will not be seen as a denial of justice. 
Anyone violating these regulations will no longer be authorized 
to live in the country." 
  Although it is no secret the United States is a superpower 
and as of today is the number one nation on earth, this does not 
mean, if it wants to act according to the law and morals, it 
should try to become sort of a comptroller supervising the 
legality of third states. 
  Therefore, to prevent unnecessary frictions and so relations 
between our country and the United States can develop within the 
framework of mutual respect, our Foreign Ministry must ensure 
that all U.S. citizens who come in contact with our country 
memorize those two articles of our Constitution. 
  The U.S. Embassy, on the other hand, should help in carrying 
out this task for reasons that obviously need not be mentioned.

<F P=106> [Speech by Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro </F>
to mark the fourth anniversary of her election victory, at the 
Municipal Stadium in Nueva Guinea -- live] 
  [Text] Dr. Orlando Trejos Somarriba, Supreme Court chief 
justice; Father [words indistinct]; Father Pedro Rufian of Nueva 
Guinea; Nueva Guinea Mayor Orlando [name indistinct]; Mr. Sergio 
Caramagna, coordinator general of the CIAV [International 
Commission of Support and Verification]-OAS; Messrs. National 
Assembly Representatives; Mr. (Arsenio Mur), CEPAD [Evangelical 
Committee for Development Aid] delegate to Nueva Guinea; Mrs. 
Ada Luz Tablada, women's representative in Nueva Guinea; Mr. 
(Edwin Berberena); Commander Oscar; Mr. Aquilino Luis Robleto, 
president of the Development Centers; Messrs. Members of the 
diplomatic corps and international organizations who are with 
me; Messrs. Cabinet Members; residents of Nueva Guinea and of 
other municipalities who are here with me; Dear Nicaraguan 
people: 
  Thank you, friends of Nueva Guinea, for inviting me to share 
this important national celebration with you. We are gathered 
here today, 25 February 1994, happy and optimistic, to celebrate 
another year of my electoral victory, the victory of the 
Nicaraguan people who sought democracy, peace, progress, and the 
reconciliation of all Nicaraguans. 
  On 23 December 1989, during the electoral campaign, I 
visited 
Nueva Guinea and found that war, repression, and political 
persecution were assailing the region. I remember telling you 
that national sovereignty only exists where the people are 
sovereign, as reflected through free and honest elections. On 
that occasion, I also promised you that I would end the economic 
crisis and promote production in a country that was bankrupt 
both morally and economically. 
  You are aware that it has been difficult to face the 
historic 
challenge of rebuilding our economy from the ground up and 
rescuing our sacred democratic and moral values. I want to tell 
you that I will not rest until I turn over to the next 
Nicaraguan who succeeds me in the Presidency a country better 
than the one I received, a country where there is clear 
socioeconomic growth. Today we speak with pride in Nicaragua, 
from north to south and from the Atlantic to the Pacific, 
because we are people who are working to consolidate democracy, 
peace, and progress. 
  I want to commend our brothers on the Atlantic coast, who 
will hold elections for regional councilmen of the northern and 
southern Atlantic coastal regions on 27 February. Our Atlantic 
coast, full of ethnic and cultural values and natural resources, 
deserves to forge a promising future. All the coastal people 
who have the right to vote must now seize the opportunity to 
cast their votes and freely elect their representatives. This 
is a historic opportunity, because it is the first time 
elections will really be held in freedom and democracy on the 
Atlantic coast. From their public posts, the elected men and 
women must strive to manage rationally the autonomy of the 
Atlantic coast to benefit all coastal residents. I want to tell 
you that you will receive support from my administration, even 
with our current limitations. 
  This year we are going to begin repairing the Muy Muy-Puerto 
Cabezas road and the Puerto Cabezas-Waspam road. We are also 
going to rebuild the San Benito-Rama road. We will carry out 
the dredging projects and the intercostal canal projects in 
Bluefields, as well as the dredging of the international marine 
route. We will repair the Puerto Cabezas and Corn Island docks, 
as well as the Rama passenger dock and the Bluefields coastal 
traffic dock. 
  Nicaraguans; I have had to exercise patience, hold 
dialogues, 
and maintain maximum tolerance to carry out my national 
reconciliation policies. We gave armed groups opportunities to 
join our efforts to protect life and promote productive tasks in 
Nicaraguan society. The consequences of war, the destruction of 
the means of production, and the shortage of resources to deal 
with the demands of production and the creation of jobs caused 
some Nicaraguans to devote themselves to committing crimes and 
provoking uprisings. This must become a closed chapter in our 
fatherland's history. That type of behavior does not lead to 
anything good. Instead, it makes us poorer and impedes national 
and international investment, which is so very needed for our 
country's social and economic recovery. 
  My government will continue working to strengthen democracy 
and to consolidate economic and social progress. In this second 
stage of my administration, of my presidential mandate, we are 
reorganizing the nation with programs that are largely socially 
oriented and that will offer opportunities for work and 
production. 
  Never before in our history have the people, both directly 
and through intermediate organizations, been so [word 
indistinct] and participated as much in government decisions as 
they are doing now. The people's organization has been essential 
to my government program because it is the people, in constant 
communication with my government, who make this time of peace, 
reconciliation, and opportunities for all possible. 
  We are drawing up new programs which we will call Peace and 
Development for Nueva Segovia, Madrid, Esteli, Guaco, Jinotega, 
Matagalpa, and the central Zelaya departments. That is why I am 
sending able officials, as well as material and financial 
resources, to the areas of the country that deserve special 
attention. I am sending not only our own resources but also 
those of friendly countries and nongovernmental and 
international organizations which have not forsaken us. We will 
continue supporting the state's reforms through the 
decentralization of health services, education, [word 
indistinct], tax collection, protection of natural resources, as 
well as the development of each one of our communities through 
the citizens' participation. 
  This year, with our own resources and with help from 
friendly 
nations, we will develop more than 1,600 projects throughout the 
country from Guascala to San Juan del Norte and from Somotillo 
to Cardenas. With these project we will respond to the demands 
of citizens made through the municipalities. In 1994, the 
international year of the family, with UNICEF's support and in 
consultation with all the municipal governments, my 
administration's top priority will be to develop the Mayors' 
Friends and Defenders of Children program. The goal of this 
program is to reduce infant mortality, school dropouts, and 
malnutrition and to provide care for children in difficult 
circumstances. This Peace and Development program will focus on 
priorities of activating the productive capabilities in those 
regions to stimulate greater production and achieve better 
economic growth. 
  We will support production and the producers who meet their 
commitments with the banks with more credits in all the regions 
of Guaco, Chontales and Nueva Guinea. The National Bank will 
reserve 70 percent more credits for the upcoming agricultural 
season. My government will continue to support cattle raising 
as well as the production of ginger, green beans, and other 
products that you have harvested with so much success here. 
That is why the National Bank has earmarked more than 200 
billion cordobas for producers who meet their commitments in 
this region. 
  Friends of Nueva Guinea, this territory was inhabited many 
years ago by men and women from different parts of our nation 
who with a great deal of effort formed an iron-clad union 
between man and the land. 
  Thanks to their devotion, farmers and their plots have 
become the true symbols of Nueva Guinea. 
  Nueva Guinea is a national example of determination, 
patriotism, organization, and progress. You have capably forged 
for yourselves a very secure future, and you have overcome 
obstacles to seeking rapprochement among yourselves by 
practicing reconciliation without giving in to partisan or 
ideological differences. 
  During my electoral campaign I promised to achieve peace and 
eliminate obligatory military service so that tranquility would 
be restored in each and every home, and I have fulfilled my 
promise. [applause] 
  Today we are living in peace. Our fellow Nicaraguans have 
resumed work on their land and are sources of joy and support 
for their homes. The demobilized resistance fighters and 
retired Army troops are the best example of reconciliation. The 
armed movements that existed in Nueva Guinea at the beginning of 
my term have been defeated thanks to the resolve of my 
government and the peace commissions in Nueva Guinea. This firm 
resolve has made my pledge and the hopes of the men and women of 
this lovely municipality come true. 
  In Nueva Guinea my government has invested in economic 
rehabilitation projects for the people affected by the war, the 
basic grain program, potable water service, 230 homes, a new 
telephone system, anti-cholera treatment, the construction of 
600 latrines, and 4,750 desks for a total during my term in 
office of approximately 11 million cordobas. 
  In Muelle de los Bueyes we built a health center, rebuilt 
city hall, and built the small market for a total investment of 
11,778 cordobas. In El Rama we built sidewalks, a dock at the 
port, and rebuilt the market for an investment of 70,000 
cordobas. In El Almendro we built a bridge and a community 
center at a cost of 72,000 cordobas. 
  Over the past three years your municipalities have 
progressed 
significantly. I made an effort to fulfill my pledges to you, my 
dear friends, and I have accomplished that. I am grateful to 
the international organizations represented in Nueva Guinea for 
the valuable support they have given this municipality. I am 
especially grateful for the cooperation provided by Spain; our 
friends from Worldwide Aid [Auxilio Mundial]; the Governments of 
Italy, The Netherlands, and Sweden; and all the organizations 
that have worked in these four municipalities. 
  El Rama, Muelle de los Bueyes, El Almendro, and Nueva Guinea 
are sources of constant concern for me. I would like to do more 
for these municipalities and make their administration more 
effective and efficient so that the budget allotments assigned 
to them by my government will reach them on schedule. To this 
end I have decided to send a draft bill to the National Assembly 
whereby we can fulfill your request and your dream of creating a 
new department [applause] with these four municipalities, which 
will organize and execute programs for this rich area. I will 
await your suggestions to make a reality of this geopolitical 
division which, unquestionably, will help us strengthen the path 
toward progress in what will be Nicaragua's newest department. 
[applause] 
  For this reason, ever since political polarization occurred 
at the National Assembly, I spared no effort in attaining a 
minimum consensus among the deputies of the various parties so 
we could fulfill another of the pledges made during our 
campaign, to amend the Constitution. During the installation of 
the National Assembly's 10th session on 10 January, I said I 
endorsed the idea of partially amending the Constitution, that I 
followed carefully the debates of these amendments, and that, 
with due respect for the government branches' autonomy, my 
government will effectively contribute to enrich the nature of 
these reforms. I expect the Constitution amendments to benefit 
Nicaragua. Consequently, the Nicaraguan people should take 
advantage of this historic opportunity to attain unity around a 
constitution that can help us face big challenges and national 
problems in this decade and the next. The Nicaraguan people must 
rebuild the country and attain steady economic development, 
which will make it possible for us to make significant progress 
in the creation of jobs and reduction of extreme poverty. 
  Fellow Nicaraguans, we are facing big challenges which we 
will have to overcome realistically and patriotically, without 
populism or demagoguery. These problems include the war sequel, 
huge foreign debt, extremely low per capita income, high 
unemployment rate, conflicts and tasks related to property 
ownership, a marked deterioration of the infrastructure, 
ecology, and rapid population growth. Meeting these challenges 
requires a small yet strong and agile state, a state that can 
regulate, lead, and pave the way, a state that can offset, in 
favor of the poorest sector, the effects of any imbalances. We 
can only resolve these problems on a medium- term basis with the 
support of all social forces coalesced around shared national 
objectives. 
  We need a reformed constitution which can make it possible 
for us to advance in an orderly fashion toward a solution for 
the country's social and economic problems. Such a constitution 
can also reinforce the democratic process. For this reason, I 
have followed the situation very closely and talked with the 
political forces that have been debating several positions and 
proposals to reform our Constitution. To stimulate a national 
consensus on these reforms, I will send to the National Assembly 
in March a government proposal on the Constitution's reforms. 
This will not preclude a continued effort to reach an agreement 
among all political forces of the country. We must attain this 
consensus to enforce the reforms and their beneficial effect on 
the state's institutions. Because the proposed reforms could 
harm the state's organization, I am convinced that the proposal 
must of necessity rely on the approval of all state branches and 
be widely discussed with the country's other sectors. The 
constitutional principle of harmonious coordination of the 
Nicaraguan state's branches should find their highest expression 
in this constitutional reform process. 
  I am also making a great effort to fulfill another election 
promise. I promised that the Armed Forces would be of a 
professional nature and would not belong to any one political 
party. Despite the many difficulties that my government and the 
Army have experienced in the search for a consensus on the new 
military organization law over the past few years, I can say 
that disparagement, mistrust, and misunderstanding have been 
left behind. 
  The determination and devotion which we have all invested in 
this difficult task has led to this law, which renders it 
possible to establish a professional, party-free, small, and 
friendly Army which will work in harmony with civilian power. 
It will be the Army of all Nicaraguans that the great heroes of 
our fatherland dreamed of. [applause] 
  I hope that once we complete the necessary procedures for 
passage of the law this promise will promptly become a reality 
for the benefit of the entire Nicaraguan nation. The Nicaraguan 
people trust in God. We believe in peace, democracy, 
reconciliation, and progress. I believe in my people; I believe 
in you and I believe in Nicaragua. Therefore, I want you to 
know that Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who is a friend to all of 
you and president of all Nicaraguans, will continue working 
during the rest of her presidential term to improve the living 
conditions of all her people. 
  As I also told you on 23 December 1989, instead of tiring we 
must have faith and enthusiasm to build a better Nicaragua, a 
peaceful Nicaragua, a land that will be very close to God, with 
a noble people who from day to day make an effort to establish 
the reign of social justice, peace, and progress in the land 
where they were born. Thank you to all of you, my dear friends. 
In a little while I will have a few more words for you. 
[applause] 
  I would like to inform all of you, my dear friends of Nueva 
Guinea and people of all the municipalities and throughout 
Nicaraguan who perhaps have not heard or have not been informed, 
of the good news: Yesterday the Armed Forces and the 3-80 Front 
signed an agreement with members of my government that ends our 
differences. [applause] 
  This agreement marks the end of the war and ensures that we 
will finally be able to achieve the peace for which we have all 
yearned. This is particularly important for all Nicaraguans on 
this day, 25 February. I congratulate all of the boys for their 
patriotic gesture, and I would like to ask all the people who 
are with me on this morning, my dear friends, and all the 
Nicaraguan people for a round of applause to acknowledge their 
patriotic decision to lay down their weapons, (?proving) once 
and for all that the peace we have so yearned for is possible in 
our blue and white [colors of the Nicaraguan flag] land. May 
God bless you all; may God bless all the Nicaraguan people. We 
will not falter; together we will continue working for the 
well-being of all Nicaraguans. Thank you, and may God bless you 
all, my dear friends. [applause]

<F P=106> [Report by Milviana Jerez from the "National Newscast;" </F>
passages within quotation marks are recorded] 
  [Text] Foreign Cooperation Minister Erwin Kruger 
categorically denied any misuse of funds in his ministry, adding 
that an audit conducted by an international firm from 1991 to 
the present confirmed that everything is aboveboard. 
  Kruger also confirmed the resignation of Deputy Foreign 
Trade 
Minister Alfonso Deshon. 
  [Kruger] "I categorically and completely reject those 
reports. There has been no misuse of funds in this ministry. 
You must understand that the Foreign Cooperation Ministry is 
the ministry that works to obtain foreign cooperation." 
  Kruger added that an international auditing firm confirmed 
that there has been no misuse of funds in his ministry. 
  [Kruger] "For two consecutive years, an international 
auditing firm presented an independent report to the 
international community on the state of foreign cooperation. 
The international community has found the system to be 
appropriate and has been satisfied with the reports." 
  Kruger said Comptroller General Arturo Harding visited him 
this morning. 
  [Kruger] "We are open. If the Comptroller General wants to 
visit our office, he is perfectly welcome. We will show him all 
the work we have done, all the audits. We are not trying to 
hide anything. On the contrary, all of you, many of you, know 
me and know the work I have done and the honesty with which we 
handle this office." 
  Kruger said he regrets such reports, which only hinder 
international cooperation. 
  [Kruger] "Our objective is not to file suits. I believe the 
problem of democracy is a problem of all Nicaraguans and that we 
should exercise our right to inform responsibly." 
  The Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden give Nicaragua $67 
million in cooperation aid per year.

<F P=106> [Report by Maria Elsa Suarez; from the "National Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] After a meeting with President Violeta Chamorro, 
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov said Nicaragua 
and Russia will strengthen trade relations. The deputy foreign 
ministers of both nations signed a cooperation agreement, and 
the Russian official met with Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo 
later in the afternoon. 
  Mamedov told President Violeta Chamorro of his government's 
desire to strengthen bilateral relations by creating mixed 
enterprises, supporting the geothermal industry, and providing 
technical assistance. He also expressed President Yeltsin's 
desire to meet with President Chamorro in the near future. 
  [Begin Mamedov recording] We told President Chamorro that 
the 
United States could equally contribute to the democratic 
transformation in Nicaragua. I have also told President 
Chamorro that I visited her office five years ago when someone 
else was there, but this time I felt more comfortable. [end 
recording] 
  Mamedov also met with Presidency Minister Lacayo. They 
discussed ways to strengthen bilateral trade and the 
transformation process in both countries. 
  The Nicaraguan and Russian deputy foreign ministers signed a 
protocol on consultations between both foreign ministries. 
  Nicaraguan Deputy Foreign Minister Jose Pallais spoke during 
the ceremony: 
  [Begin Pallais recording] Russia has significantly 
contributed to the achievement of democracy and peace in Central 
America. In the future, we hope to strengthen and increase 
commercial relations between our countries. [end recording] 
  Nicaragua's foreign debt with Russia is approximately $500 
million. The renegotiation of that debt is pending. 
  [Begin Mamedov recording] My personal opinion is that we 
could and should forgive part of the debt. [end recording]

pipeline. Acosta reported that Colombian Petroleum Enterprise 
will not be able to lease the pipeline to Ecuador to transport

  [Text] President Rafael Caldera today issued two decrees -- 
which were subsequently approved by the Council of Ministers -- 
to suspend the value-added tax [VAT] for consumers throughout 
the country. Central Information Office Director Guillermo 
Alvarez Bajares publicly announced that the presidential decree 
issued on 27 December 1993 was repealed, while Decree 51 
temporarily suspends the economic guarantees established in 
Article 96 of the national Constitution. 
  [Begin recording] [Alvarez, in progress]...Chapter 5 of the 
economic rights section. Everyone may freely dedicate himself 
to the lucrative activity of his choice without any limitations 
other than those established in this Constitution and by the law 
for reasons of security, health, or social interest. The law 
will dictate norms to prevent profiteering, improper price 
increases, and generally abusive actions intended to obstruct or 
restrict economic freedoms. Obviously the previous 
administration could not enforce the application of the VAT, or 
at least with any practical consequences, because the 
appropriate mechanisms for proper oversight or application did 
not exist. Store owners who did not charge the VAT in the past 
few days because of the measures that had been announced, even 
though they were not in effect, will not be subject to any 
penalties. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Those who did not charge the tax 
will 
not be [words indistinct]? 
  [Alvarez] No, that will not go into effect. Store owners who 
did not charge customers the VAT will not be subject to 
sanctions. 
  [Reporter] What about those who charged the tax until 18 
January? 
  [Alvarez] Those who charged the tax until the date announced 
will have to proceed according to the regulations on the matter.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Marcano from "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Chamber of Deputies approved in its first 
debate an emergency bill to solve the Banco Latino crisis, and 
the Executive Branch will possibly promulgate that legal 
instrument next week. The debate began at the lower chamber at 
1630. The legal instrument establishes the necessary norms so 
people who deposited their money in the bank may recover their 
money. 
  [Begin Walter Marquez, Banco Latino Commission chairman, 
recording] The deputies agreed to approve the bill in the first 
debate. The proposed changes in style and content will be 
reviewed during the second debate. The president has announced 
that an urgent meeting will be held on Monday to complete the 
process for the bill's approval. Congress will be in permanent 
session until the bill is fully approved on Monday afternoon or 
evening. The Senate should review it on Tuesday, and the 
documents will be sent to the president on Tuesday or Wednesday 
for promulgation. [end recording] 
  The Chamber of Deputies' Finance Commission has been in 
permanent session since Thursday in order to prepare the 
respective report. 
  [Begin unidentified deputy recording] The bill seeks to 
achieve two goals: first, to regulate this specific emergency at 
Banco Latino and guarantee account holders will be able to 
recover the largest amount of money possible; second, to prevent 
similar situations from occurring in the future. Do you see the 
importance of this text? [end recording] 
  The Chamber of Deputies debates will possibly continue 
during 
the weekend because the Finance Commission, which is in 
permanent session, is expected to present a report on Friday for 
the second debate on Saturday. Hence, the deputies will approve 
the bill, thus allowing the Senate to begin its first discussion 
on Tuesday. The special bill for Banco Latino will probably be 
sanctioned by Wednesday.

  [Text] Apparently, it will take Congress longer than 
expected to pass an emergency bill to resolve the Banco Latino 
crisis. A disagreement between the Finance Commission and the 
Central Bank of Venezuela was evident on Friday. 
  The emergency bill, after it was passed in the first debate 
by the Chamber of Deputies, is now in the hands of Finance 
Commission members. The commission has declared itself in 
permanent session to prepare a report that will mark the 
beginning of the second debate. On Friday, Betsaida Vera [not 
further identified] attended the Finance Commission's meeting 
but disagreed with some of the bill's articles. She says that if 
the bill is passed exactly as it was drafted, it could conflict 
with the General Banking Law and other financial institutions. 
  [Begin Vera recording] Article 4 of the bill violates the 
General Banking Law's stipulations on intervention because this 
is no longer an emergency situation. Each of the pertinent 
aspects must be considered. Otherwise, enforcement of the law 
would be troublesome because the enforcers would not be sure of 
what to do. And the enforcers are human. Each of them has his 
own opinion and will interpret the law as he understands it, as 
he pleases, or as he sees fit. [end recording] 
  The Finance Commission members met with their legal advisers 
to try to present a report with the consensus of all political 
factions, considering that the idea is to correct the 
ambiguities and gaps in the bill's original form. 
  Senator Haydee Castillo, who heads the bicameral commission 
that handles the Banco Latino case, also attended the Finance 
Commission meeting because she believes this will prompt the 
Senate to speed up the discussion once the proposal reaches the 
Senate. 
  [Begin Castillo recording] The Chamber of Deputies' Finance 
Commission is working at present and plans to meet tomorrow and 
on Sunday to polish off the bill for its second debate. Some of 
the senators, members of the commission handling the Banco 
Latino case, are here trying to prevent the bill, as it is 
released by the Chamber of Deputies, from undergoing any changes 
in the Senate so it can be expedited according to the 
Constitution and not have to be returned to the Chamber. [end 
recording] 
  Despite the differences of opinion between the Central Bank 
of Venezuela delegate and the members of the Chamber of 
Deputies' Finance Commission, the deputies will keep working so 
they can present, no later than next Monday, a report for the 
second debate of the special bill on Banco Latino. Gustavo 
Rossen, president of the auditing commission, and Finance 
Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez have been invited to come to the 
Chamber on Saturday.

<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano from "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Rafael Angel Caldera believes that the 
National Congress should approve the constitutional reforms as 
quickly as possible. He said that it is no secret that the 
constitutional reforms will not solve the country's urgent 
problems but will instead serve to set the guidelines for the 
new nation that Venezuelans can build. 
  The president made these statements during the presentation 
of a new book by COPRE [Presidential Committee for State Reform] 
President Ricardo Conveias entitled "A Constitution for the 
Future [Una Constitucion Para el Futuro],'' a collection of 
reflections on the constitutional reform draft bill that the 
bicameral commission, over which Rafael Caldera himself 
previously presided, will present. 
  [Begin recording] [Caldera] At this time, with the country's 
need for change and a need to face up to its problems, the topic 
of constitutional reform is fundamental and cannot be postponed. 
I am convinced of the country's urgent need to carry out 
constitutional reforms. Parliamentary experience shows that a 
draft bill in the lawmaking process that is begun during a 
legislative period, even though it may be badly needed, 
generally speaking does not get approved until the following 
legislative period. There would be no reason to waste all that 
effort during the preceding period and not take advantage of the 
fact that with only one more debate to go in the Senate a big 
commission that represents all sectors and fulfills all hopes 
could review the bill in depth for a second debate in the 
Senate, for reconsideration in the Chamber of Deputies, and then 
submit it this year to a popular referendum. 
  [Conveias] It is a delicate task but one of great 
significance, especially taking into account the country's 
current situation. Congress, in assuming this huge and delicate 
job, will somehow reconcile itself and give the country the 
possibility of having a new constitution through a popular 
referendum. We believe a deadline should be set for this and we 
must all assume the sacred mission of naming a constituent 
assembly, which will be complemented with the favorable vote 
cast by the majority of voters the day of the referendum. This 
task is important, it is a priority, and it should not restrain 
congressmen from carrying out other important legislative and 
control tasks. [end recording] 
  Dr. Conveias insisted that their intention is not to impose 
deadlines on Congress but that congressmen should impose it on 
themselves so they can be in tune with the Venezuelan people's 
demands.

<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano from "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Arias Cardenas said 
today at Miraflores Palace none of the accused in the 4 February 
and 27 November events have been pressured by the executive for 
their discharge. 
  The meeting between Arias and the president lasted more than 
half an hour. In an atmosphere of cordiality, Arias told 
President Caldera of some of his beliefs on what has happened in 
the country. During a lengthy news conference after the meeting, 
Arias told journalists of the president's receptiveness toward 
his proposal. He affirmed his confidence in the president's 
capability to lead the country. The military officer ruled out 
any possibility of a coup in the new political scenario in 
Venezuela. 
  [Begin Arias recording] All the proposals I made to the 
president were received honestly and sincerely, very openly and 
frankly. I informed him of the large number of officers who 
want only to return to the Armed Forces. Most of the officers 
who remain in prison have no political designs; they have no 
aspiration to power. They only want to serve their country, and 
they believe they can best do so in the Armed Forces. 
  I also told the president the reconciliation process is not 
the victory of old ways. I told him the vision I, and many 
others, have about this pacification and harmonization process 
is one of a united Armed Forces. The Armed Forces, which for a 
long time have been considered the country's moral reserve, have 
had the capacity for division so as to originate this new 
situation the country is beginning to experience. [sentence as 
heard] [end recording] 
  Arias expressed support for a pacification based on pardons 
and a concerted effort to build a dignified and honest country. 
He said that although for the time being he will not work to 
build his political career, this idea has not been totally ruled 
out.

<F P=106> [Report by Gina Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Movement for Socialism [MAS] Deputy Enrique Ochoa 
Antich has reported that to help prevent crime, the Human Rights 
Committee has stressed the need to implement some urgent 
measures in addition to the government's personal safety 
program. Ochoa Antich added that the Chamber of Deputies' 
Domestic Policy Commission should open a dialogue with the 
Foreign Ministry to discuss this subject. 
  One of the 10 measures proposed by Ochoa Antich is to create 
a national office to coordinate state security agencies' 
intelligence services to preclude the need for mass repression 
operations. He also proposes to institutionalize regular 
meetings between the organized society and the country's 
security services, as well as to create a special fund whereby 
businessmen and citizens can contribute to the hiring of new 
police members who will be specifically assigned to their own 
areas. 
  He also said that police villages should be built so they 
and 
their families can be protected while police are on duty. 
Another action would be to approve an agreement between 
universities and the Interior Relations Ministry whereby medical 
and psychology students provide periodic checkups for the police. 
  It would be advisable to include human rights in the 
soldiers 
and police academies curriculum and to guarantee the allocation 
of budgets to build new kinds of jails to help counter the 
pernicious self-reproducing effect of crime in traditional 
prisons. 
  Two of the most important points in the dozen proposed by 
Ochoa Antich deal with approving a special program to care for 
abandoned children and the discussion with television station 
owners on program violence and the possibility of stations 
refraining from airing programs specifically targeted for adults 
during daylight hours. 
  Because all this involves disbursement, the deputy 
underlined 
the fact that while only one or two percent of the national 
budget is earmarked for public security in Venezuela, up to 10 
percent of the national budget is earmarked for this purpose in 
other countries. For this reason, he said it is necessary to 
reshuffle the budget.

members of the Inter-American Defense College's [CID] Class 33 
currently visiting Venezuela, Brigadier General Alvaro Rafael 
Barboza Rodriguez, Joint Staff operations director, reported 
that between 50 and 60 tons of various drugs circulate through 
Venezuela annually. 
  The CID director and U.S. Army Major General James Harding 
said that the students come from 14 countries on the continent. 
CID courses last 10 months, beginning in July. "This is an 
opportunity to exchange views and get to know these countries a 
little better. It is a very simple project," he said. 
  In halting Spanish, Maj. Harding said that according to data 
supplied by CID and the Inter-American Defense Board, which he 
leads also, terrorism and drug trafficking are the major threats 
to the continent's security. "We should strive jointly to find a 
solution to the drug trafficking problem, which goes beyond 
borders and helps the entire world. The cooperation of all 
governments is required," he said. 
  In the morning Harding paid a courtesy call to Defense 
Minister General Rafael Montero Revette. The CID members will 
fly to Colombia on Thursday. 
  Gen. Barboza, former commander of the Venezuela unit which 
operated in Honduras and Nicaragua on pacification duties, was 
selected by the Defense Ministry to make a general assessment of 
the "military situation" in Venezuela. He described as a threat 
the use of Venezuela as "a springboard for the traffic of drugs 
to Central America and their final destination, the United 
States." An estimate of the quantity of drugs circulating 
through Venezuela was made by the National Guard. "Only 10 
percent of this quantity is seized. This gives an idea of the 
seriousness of the problem," he said. He also reported on the 
discovery of marijuana and coca plantations in the Perija 
Mountains and areas close to the Colombian border. Money 
laundering "has been detected essentially in four areas: 
Tachira; Zulia, near Maicao; Caracas, through real estate 
operations; and the country's eastern region," he said. 
  He recalled that the most successful years in the 
counternarcotics struggle were 1991 and 1992, when 11.981 tons 
and 12.681 tons, respectively, were confiscated. In 1993 the 
drug seizure level again was close to 3 tons, a figure similar 
to that of 1990. Cocaine is the most often confiscated drug. 
Next comes marijuana, 400 kg of which are seized annually. "The 
fact that heroin is entering the local market again is 
worrisome," he said. 
  The UN believes this is a worldwide problem. The number of 
involved countries has risen from 64 in 1990 to 138 in the first 
half of 1993. 
  Gen. Barboza announced that this year the Armed Forces will 
put two flight control radar sites into operation. One of them 
will be located in Falcon State and cover the country's central 
and western region. The other, located in Nueva Esparta, will 
serve to monitor flights between the country's central and 
eastern regions. These sites are being installed through 
agreements with U.S. counternarcotics agencies, such as DEA, 
CIA, and others. "These sites will be operated jointly with our 
Armed Forces," he said. 
  This illegal activity can be monitored more effectively by 
observing the flight patterns of the drug traffickers' planes, 
that is to say, speed, altitude, time, and routes, as well as 
the types of planes used. A special overflight program, 
originating in Panama and reaching Peru and Bolivia with 
observers aboard, is being set up. Special surveillance 
operations can be conducted at the request of the Venezuelan 
Government or the U.S. Southern Command.

  [Text] Punto Fijo, 23 Feb -- The Venezuelan Navy and Air 
Force will carry out Operation Maravia in the Gulf of Venezuela. 
The exercise will conclude on 27 February. Rear Admiral Miguel 
Alvarez Diaz leads the joint Navy and Air Force exercise. Three 
frigates, two transports, five patrol boats, one submarine, two 
coast guard vessels, and two Navy planes will represent the 
Navy. Four squadrons each of F-16's, Mirage 50's, and VF-5's 
will represent the Air Force. The artillery group and the 
command and control center headquartered in Falcon State will 
represent the Air Defense Command. 
  According to military sources in Punto Fijo, Operation 
Maravia is "a war game with the participation of naval, air, and 
amphibious components to assess and develop sea, air, and land 
fighting tactics with the purpose of forming a joint task force 
capable of controlling the air and sea in the theater of 
operations, thus improving to the utmost the capability of the 
forces used, based on on-site training." The information 
underlines the military personnel's degree of training during 
the operation, training which results from the various 
situations and conditions that simulate a true situation. 
  In a press note, the Falcon Garrison Command reported to the 
people in general that planes will be overflying Paraguana 
Peninsula. The note concludes with an invitation to the general 
public of the region to visit the command units anchored at 
Guaranao Port on 26 and 27 February on the occasion of Punto 
Fijo Day.

<F P=106> [Article by Mario Chimanovitch] </F>
  [Text] It would make a great story for a novel by Ian 
Fleming, the creator of secret agent James Bond. Arab 
terrorists buy weapons on the Brazilian-Paraguayan border to 
perpetrate attacks that jeopardize the peace-seeking process 
between Israel and the PLO. This is not just the product of the 
imagination of an author. About 15 days ago foreign 
intelligence services agents in Foz de Iguacu (Parana) detected 
five Arabs, presumably Palestinians from Lebanon, contacting 
local weapon traffickers. They wanted to buy plastic 
explosives, and AR-15 and FAL rifles. 
  News of the presence of these Arabs reached Brasilia. 
Brazilian intelligence services and Federal Police were placed 
on a state of alert. There is fear that an attack like the one 
on 17 March 1992 against the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires -- 
which resulted in 29 deaths -- may take place. Brazilian and 
foreign intelligence experts are working on the theory that 
fundamentalists linked to the Hizballah -- Party of God, a 
pro-Iranian organization headquartered in Lebanon -- are trying 
to obstruct the peace-seeking plan between Israelis and 
Palestinians. An attack would disqualify the PLO as a reliable 
interlocutor. Iran and some Arab extremist organizations are 
against any sort of agreement between Palestinians and the State 
of Israel. 
  It is believed the five individuals may have entered 
Brazilian territory through Argentina or Paraguay, taking 
advantage of the Argentine-Brazil-Paraguay border region and, 
especially, of the possible logistic support they may have 
obtained from members of the important Arab community in the 
region. 
  Federal Police Director Colonel Wilson Romao told ISTOE that 
"this is a potentially explosive situation and we are taking the 
necessary measures to identify these five individuals and 
prevent them from using Brazil as a springboard for 
international terrorism." Romao confirmed that since January he 
has been receiving reports from the border region on movements 
of suspicious members of the local Arab community. Romao said 
the terrorist threat is real in Foz de Iguacu. He asserted: 
"There are all the necessary facilities there to acquire weapons 
and the flights that may be used for terrorist actions." 
  The existence of links between terrorists and sectors of the 
Arab communities in the south of Brazil was established when the 
intelligence services discovered that Quarai town in Rio Grande 
do Sul was used as a logistic base for the attack in Buenos 
Aires. An extremist cell was established here years ago to 
collect funds from the Arab communities established in Rio 
Grande do Sul and Parana States to finance sabotage operations 
against Israeli or Jewish targets in Argentina and Uruguay. 
ISTOE found out that weeks before the attack on the Israeli 
Embassy in Buenos Aires, the bodies of a Palestinian couple from 
Jordan were found inside a vehicle that went over a precipice in 
the town of Banhado do Taim (Rio Grande do Sul). The police 
found a large quantity of gold bars with the bodies. The case, 
at that time, was regarded as an unfortunate story of gold 
smuggling. It was even said that the gold belonged to the well- 
known dollar trader Najum Turner, who was involved in the 
so-called "Uruguay Operation," to cover a loan for Fernando 
Collor de Mello's electoral campaign. Turner, who is Jewish, 
was allegedly dealing with gold on the black market for Arab 
clients unaware that those funds could be used to finance 
terrorist operations against Israel.

<F P=106> [Article by Gabriel Pasquini] </F>
  [Text] Defense Minister Oscar Camilion guaranteed the 
Brazilian Government of President Itamar Franco that Argentina 
"will under no circumstance sacrifice its relations with Brazil 
to strengthen its links with the United States." Carrying out a 
more diplomatic than military mission, Camilion met members of 
the Brazilian civilian and military ministries in Brasilia in an 
effort to improve the deteriorated relations between the two 
countries. 
  Sources close to the minister told PAGINA/12: "The Brazilian 
Government invited Camilion for a visit to try to ease the 
current bad bilateral relations." But Camilion is very well 
known in Brazilian political circles because under a similar 
situation in 1977, when he was ambassador in Brasilia, he had to 
maneuver with great skill to reduce the reciprocal tension that 
was threatening to explode into open conflict. 
  The current situation has not reached that extreme but it is 
really bad. With difficulties in the process of Mercosur [Common 
Market of the South] and problems on economic matters, the 
foreign policies of the two countries are going in different 
directions: While Argentina is getting closer to the United 
States, Brazil opens new fronts of conflicts with Washington 
every day. 
  This is particularly true on military matters. The Brazilian 
Armed Forces have expressed their anti-American position and 
refused to take a step back in their independent arms race 
development. The Brazilian Armed Forces have charged that the 
United States is trying to go over Brazilian sovereignty in the 
Amazon, and have indirectly accused several neighboring 
countries -- including Argentina -- of allowing the Pentagon 
military exercises and bases in their territory for that purpose. 
  This situation has worsened the historic military distrust 
between Argentina and Brazil. Camilion is aware that the 
situation now involves a triangle: In his meetings with U.S. 
officials in Washington last year, Camilion was able to 
personally see the concern of Bill Clinton's administration over 
the future of Brazil. 
  This is why he said on 24 February that Argentina "will 
under 
no circumstance sacrifice its relations with Brazil to 
strengthen its links with the United States." 
  Argentina and Brazil also agreed that the Argentine purchase 
of U.S. Skyhawk planes is no reason for conflict. Brazilian 
diplomatic sources said: "No one believes the rearming effort 
is against Brazil." Camilion also publicly said: "Argentina is 
not interested in creating any problems with its neighbors." 
  It is not easy, however, to make progress on the military 
chapter of Mercosur, as was clearly established at the first 
Mercosur armed forces seminar, held in Buenos Aires last year, 
when due to the different positions no common agreement beyond 
the formal was reached. 
  Camilion admitted: "Integration in that area is not so 
easy." As an example, Argentina and Brazil are rivals in the 
bidding for supplying 764 training airplanes to the U.S. Air 
Force and Navy. Camilion said: "The two countries' airplanes 
are among the best." Then in a conciliatory manner he suggested 
that the two countries' military industries could reach a 
cooperation agreement if one of them gets the contract. The 
briefing Camilion will give President Carlos Menem today after 
his return to Buenos Aires on his talks with Itamar Franco will 
certainly not cover just these issues.

  [Text] Porto Alegre -- The Amadeo Rossi Weapons and 
Ammunition Inc. of Sao Leopoldo, Rio Grande do Sul, closed a 
deal with the Thai Army to supply 6,000 single-barrel shotguns 
for $280,000. This was reported by company exports manager Rubem 
Faggiano. The .12-gauge Pomba-230 shotguns will be inspected on 
21 March by the Royal Thai Army-Bangkok, and will be shipped 
immediately from the Port of Rio Grande. The payment will be 
made in cash through a letter of credit, Faggiano reported. 
  This is the first sale Rossi has made to Thailand after 
winning an international bid last October. Rossi Inc. 
manufactures nearly 20,000 Pomba-230 shotguns per year, 7,000 of 
which are exported to Argentina. "New markets for this kind of 
weapon are opening in Africa and the Middle East," Faggiano 
said. Five hundred shotguns, which will be shipped in April, 
were sold to Papua New Guinea for $30,000, Faggiano said. 
  Long-barrel weapons are responsible for less than 20 percent 
of Rossi's sales. About 3,500 of these weapons are manufactured 
per month. The $30 million sales Rossi made in 1993 were 
principally obtained through the sale of handguns, of which 
Rossi manufactures 20,000 to 22,000 per month. 
  Handgun exports amounted to $18 million last year in 
comparison with $14 million in 1992 and $9 million in 1991. From 
40 to 45 percent of the export production is sold in the U.S. 
market. Last January, the special Rossi 720 .44-caliber with a 
four-inch barrel for five shots, received an award as "the best 
imported handgun" from the American Fire Arms Institute 
[preceding four words in English] made up of U.S. weapons 
manufacturers. 
  This year, Rossi will launch a .22-caliber Magnum revolver 
and the entire .357-caliber Magnum line with ventilated ribs and 
stainless steel parts. Rossi also will launch the six-bullet 
Snubby revolver, a .38-caliber special (SPL) small gun that 
weighs nearly 700 grams and which is being manufactured for five 
bullets so far.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Minister of Social Security Antonio </F>
Britto by Artur Pereira; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Atlantida, Rio Grande do Sul--Identified in a recent 
poll as the PMDB's [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] 
favorite candidate for president of Brazil, former Minister of 
Social Security Antonio Britto insists he is going to run for 
governor of Rio Grande do Sul State. Now recovered from surgery 
to repair a hernia, Britto is relaxing at the beach resort of 
Atlantida and using the time to receive an average of 50 people 
a day, mostly delegates from the state branch of the PMDB. Walks 
along the beach are gradually being replaced by long phone 
conversations in which he tries to round up support for the 
party's nomination. "The only reason I would not run for 
governor is if the party denies me the nomination," he said. 
  The decision to run in a regional election, in his opinion, 
puts him in an especially good position to discuss the future of 
his party, now weakened by charges of corruption against quite a 
few of its stalwarts. Britto's prescription is simple: "The PMDB 
candidate must be a familiar face. It must be a clean face." To 
the former minister, politicians today can no longer equivocate 
when it comes to ethical and moral issues. 
  These subtle criticisms are aimed at a specific target: 
former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia. In an interview with 
O GLOBO, Quercia had made a rather unflattering assessment of 
Antonio Britto the politician, accusing him of being too 
inexperienced to run for the presidency. The response came in 
the form of cruel irony: "I do not want to write any page today 
that I would have to explain tomorrow," Britto said, 
emphatically, after begging "Dr. Quercia's" pardon for having 
too short a resume for his 41 years. 
  In informal conversations with friends and advisors, Antonio 
Britto gives other reasons for turning down the nomination to 
run for president under the PMDB banner. He would not feel 
comfortable working the crowds in the company of colleagues 
whose images are tarnished--some by charges of corruption, 
others by woeful performances in regional posts. Britto thinks 
this would jeopardize the good ratings he has achieved in the 
polls. That is why he urges a far-reaching purge in the PMDB, 
with the proviso that the accused be guaranteed every 
opportunity to defend themselves. "The way it is on the campaign 
trail today, the PMDB has to stop at every corner to give 
explanations," he lamented. 
  Although he turned down the invitation to serve as the 
government's new leader in the Chamber, the former minister 
vigorously defends his friend Itamar Franco. Orestes Quercia's 
harsh criticisms of the government and the president do not 
please Britto. He credits the Itamar government with reinstating 
ethics and dignity in the federal public administration of this 
country. 
  The former minister's isolation in the southern coastal 
resort is only relative. Early in the morning Britto receives 
telephoned reports from his advisors about stories in the day's 
newspapers in central Brazil. Starting last Thursday, he began a 
program of visits to nearby towns, as part of his campaign for 
governor of the state. 
  [Pereira] A survey taken in the PMDB indicates that you are 
preferred by 35 percent of respondents, compared with 10 percent 
for Orestes Quercia. Does that encourage you to run for 
president? 
  [Antonio Britto] Obviously, I am flattered by the results of 
those polls. However, they cannot make me change a decision that 
is irreversible: my decision to run for governor of Rio Grande 
do Sul. 
  [Pereira] Deputy, you have not only the PMDB survey in your 
favor. You are also well situated in the public opinion polls. 
Wouldn't that make you change course and run for Planalto Palace? 
  [Antonio Britto] I have been interpreting those opinion 
polls 
primarily as a judgment of my accomplishments at the Ministry of 
Social Security. So I am happy when I see those figures, but a 
candidate for the presidency--and it seems to me Dr. Collor 
taught us that--is not viable unless there is a lot of solidity 
in his platform and among his supporters. 
  [Pereira] What kind of problems would prevent an agreement 
prior to October's presidential election? 
  [Antonio Britto] The parties are looking at the national 
picture through the lens of parochial interests. So the PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party] looks at the polls, sees that 
it is strong in Sao Paulo, and bases its approach on that. The 
PMDB does the same thing, and so on. 
  [Pereira] But isn't there a contradiction there? By opting 
to 
run for governor of Rio Grande do Sul, aren't you showing 
greater concern for regional matters than the problems of this 
country? 
  [Antonio Britto] It is not a matter of putting either one 
first. It is a matter of having a concern that, naturally, is 
national--to win a more appropriate role for Rio Grande do Sul. 
  [Pereira] Do you think the atmosphere is favorable to the 
emergence of an alliance at the center to oppose Lula and Maluf? 
  [Antonio Britto] I think it is only a matter of time before 
we see an understanding between the labor-oriented and social 
democratic sectors. It could happen today, if people would take 
the larger view. But if it does not happen today, it will happen 
tomorrow out of necessity. God willing, the necessity will not 
be too great and the price paid for the delay not too high. I do 
not know whether the country can stand yet another process that 
is formally legitimized by democracy but made illegitimate by 
administrative failure. What we do not know is whether the 
country will continue to put up with a situation where people 
are told to renew their hopes through the ballot box, but later 
their frustration is renewed because of the administrative 
actions they witness. 
  [Pereira] In light of this danger of a repeat of 
frustration, 
don't you think this is a good time for politicians to put aside 
their personal interests? 
  [Antonio Britto] What scares me is realizing that someone is 
going to be elected president. He will bear an extraordinary 
burden of hope, but also a dose of voter impatience that was not 
present in the wake of previous elections. 
  [Pereira] Former PMDB president Orestes Quercia said the 
country is leaderless. Would you agree? 
  [Antonio Britto] Obviously not. President Itamar inherited 
the worst situation in the history of the Republic: empty 
coffers, a disbelieving public, and a wrecked state. Despite all 
those difficulties, his performance will be measured by the fact 
that the next president will find the country in better shape 
than Itamar found it. Furthermore, we must credit him for 
reimposing ethics and dignity in the federal administration. So 
the presidential hopefuls should be the first to support Itamar. 
  [Pereira] What would you say is the purpose of those 
criticisms? 
  [Antonio Britto] I do not have to judge Dr. Quercia's 
intentions. I judge the effect of what he said, and the effect 
is not positive for this country. It is very easy today to take 
positions based on "I have nothing to do with that." 
  [Pereira] In the case of the PMDB, is this happening because 
of internal disputes? 
  [Antonio Britto] In the past, the PMDB's prestige was the 
result of a common position taken by the majority. Now we have 
neither the personal prestige represented by [the late] Tancredo 
[Neves] and Ulysses [Guimaraes], nor the programmatic prestige. 
The PMDB today is a confederation whose components talk to each 
other through the newspapers. What motivates people to stay in 
the PMDB is the belief that in political party life, you don't 
solve the problem by changing the name of the shop or its window 
display. 
  [Pereira] Former Governor Orestes Quercia said you have 
neither the background nor the experience to run for the 
presidency. What is your reaction? 
  [Antonio Britto] I should beg Dr. Quercia's pardon because, 
at 41, I have only able to become a federal deputy, a minister, 
and--above all--to earn a degree of respect that touches me 
greatly, that inspires me, i.e., the respect of my fellow 
citizens. Perhaps my delay in building a longer resume is due to 
the fact that I am very careful. I do not want to write any page 
today that I would have to explain, or regret, tomorrow. 
  [Pereira] You and Senator Pedro Simon head the so-called 
"authentic" group within the PMDB. Is that group disposed to 
face up to the fight and compete against Quercia at the party 
convention? 
  [Antonio Britto] There is no fight at all. What Senator 
Simon, I, and the majority of the party members have said is 
something extremely simple. This country has improved a lot in 
these past months because two principles without which there can 
be no nation have been rediscovered in Brazil: solidarity, and 
dignity. You can choose to be a parliamentarist, 
presidentialist, republican, monarchist, social democrat, 
socialist, or capitalist, but you cannot choose a country where 
there is no dignity or solidarity. What we have been saying is 
that in this improved country, neither the PMDB nor any other 
party can even begin to present itself to society if it does not 
offer alternatives that are characterized from the outset by 
dignity. The face of the PMDB candidate must be a clean face. 
  [Pereira] Does this mean the PMDB will have trouble during 
the presidential campaign because it harbors some of the 
so-called "dwarfs" from the Budget Committee and people accused 
of corruption, as is the case with former Governor Orestes 
Quercia? 
  [Antonio Britto] I do not think people can equivocate any 
longer on issues involving the ethical conduct of public 
figures. As for the colleagues who have been touched by the 
charges, the correct road would seem to me to be assuring ample 
opportunity for defense and total support so they can defend 
themselves. If it is proven that they are involved, the party 
can no longer live with them. 
  [Pereira] But how can you patch together a unity that 
involves leaders who have been tarnished by accusations of 
corruption or poor administration? 
  [Antonio Britto] Brazil is nostalgic for the old MDB 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement] and we in the PMDB miss it, too. 
Particularly since during the MDB era, the party's strength was 
that it could work the crowds and be considered by the 
man-in-the street as an instrument of Brazilian society that 
could bring about a sensible change in the social democratic 
line. Dr. Ulysses used to say--and he repeated it in that 
historical speech of his when he resigned as president of the 
PMDB--that "politics is either practiced in the streets, or not 
practiced at all." Going out into the streets will become 
possible for the PMDB if it understands some of the requisites 
put there by society as, for example, the need for dignity. This 
means the PMDB must undertake a renewal of its cadres. 
  [Pereira] So you do not think the PMDB is ready for the 
campaign trail today? 
  [Antonio Britto] Right now the PMDB in many states is 
uncomfortable about going into the streets and having to stop at 
every corner to give explanations. That is why we urge that 
Pedro Simon be named party president, since he has the best 
resume within the PMDB. He would be able to lead the process of 
renovation and purge. But I think that even if Simon is not 
party president, the future of the PMDB will continue to depend 
greatly on him. The party has a preliminary question to answer 
within the next few weeks: whether it wants to be a participant 
or just a spectator in the election process. If it is content to 
be a spectator, fine, then it has nothing to worry about. It can 
just keep doing what it is doing. If it wants to compete, then 
it has to change. 
  [Pereira] In light of this confused party situation, do you 
think Lula would be elected if the voting took place today? 
  [Antonio Britto] No. If Lula could be considered today as 
president-elect, he would not be stuck down there at 28 or 29 
percent. I think Lula has a biography that must be respected, 
but he has not yet faced the realities of the campaign. The 
campaign has not begun yet. Actually, so far the PT [Workers 
Party] is the only party that has not been of help to Lula. The 
rest seem--because of omission, confusion, or division--to have 
been working for Lula. 
  [Pereira] Were Lula to win the election, do you think he 
could forge the agreements that would guarantee his ability to 
govern? 
  [Antonio Britto] The biggest problem Lula faces is that fact 
that many people in the PT go to bed dreaming of Felipe Gonzalez 
but wake up next to Fidel Castro. The PT seems to me to be 
suffering from very serious doubts about the role it should 
play--a modern and progressive role that seeks alliances with 
social democratic sectors to build a majority, or the opposite. 
That can work only if the platform is a minority plan imposed on 
a majority. Both the future of the PT as a party and that of 
Lula depend on the answer to that question. 
  [Pereira] Might the indecisiveness of that parties give rise 
to another savior of the Fernando Collor type? 
  [Antonio Britto] I think that despite the suffering, the 
Collor era did us some favors. One is that it put an end to 
these candidates who come out of nowhere and, worse, whom no one 
knows where they are going. I do not think there will be 
anything new in the election context in terms of names. 
Novelties, if any, will be found in formulas, agreements, and 
coalitions. 
  [Pereira] If it turns out that the parties cannot agree on a 
candidate through a so-called "third route" and if former 
Governor Orestes Quercia wins at the PMDB convention, would you 
stand on the same platform with him? 
  [Antonio Britto] In the first place, I would be afraid of 
spoiling Dr. Quercia's platform appearances because of my lack 
of experience (chuckles). But obviously, I do not think there is 
any way for Dr. Quercia to become a candidate until the 
explanations he was asked to provide become a solid reality. I 
think he himself is acting correctly by beginning to take steps, 
that certainly have not been completed, in terms of providing 
the explanations that the public is demanding. 
  [Pereira] You were defeated in the mayoral election by 
Olivio 
Dutra, of the PT. Isn't there a risk that this will happen 
again, in the race for governor? 
  [Antonio Britto] Dutra is the one who should be worried, 
since he once ran for governor and lost. In politics, no one 
wins every time. 
  [Pereira] Deputy, it seems you are a little pessimistic as 
regards this country's future, given the indecisiveness that you 
yourself mentioned. 
  [Antonio Britto] I am not pessimistic. What I am is 
perturbed 
because what I see is a country that is poised on the brink of 
growth, a country that has already identified and located its 
problems. And yet, strangely, things are not moving forward. 
There is just one reason for this: we have not yet been able to 
build the kind of political will that can support a plan for 
change.

<F P=106> [Interview with Workers Party, PT, President Luis Inacio </F>
Lula da Silva by O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO journalist Ricardo Lessa; 
date and place not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Lessa] You have referred to 
the elite that failed... 
  [Lula] I am willing to make a political offensive against 
the 
Brazilian elite, who have managed the country as if it were 
their private property, frequently running their private 
enterprises with state funds. The elite have not fulfilled the 
duties of the state. The elite are collapsing and the PT is not 
in the government. They are collapsing because of their 
incompetence. 
  [Lessa] What is your proposal? 
  [Lula] We will implement a policy to end elites. We will 
implement an income distribution policy. I don't want 
entrepreneurs to become Marxist but Fordist. I want them to 
understand that by paying higher salaries, the workers will buy 
what they produce. Just imagine if workers could afford to buy 
cars, television sets, chicken, clothes. Our country would be 
much more civilized. Entrepreneurs do not have that mentality. 
Their mentality is one of high concentration. They sell the 
idea that the world will end tomorrow and they want to make all 
the money today. 
  [Lessa] Then, you want to improve capitalism in Brazil, 
instead of implementing Socialism, right? 
  [Lula] That is exactly what I am willing to do. At no time 
has the PT program been presented as a socialist program. The 
socialist part of it is the strategic program, the dream, the 
utopia. We are making a program for five, 10, or 15 years, to 
meet people's basic, vital needs. 
  [Lessa] How will you cope with the division within the PT? 
  [Lula] The press sees one PT, but there is another PT, which 
is the one I lead. The voting on the moratorium and on the 
minimum income took place during peaceful sessions of the 
national party executive board. Yet the press did not notice 
it. What they want is to depict a war within the PT, a war that 
does not exist. May God permit the existence of two or more 
different opinions within the PT. I do not want a party with 
just one single opinion. 
  [Lessa] But party bloc members have been forbidden to vote 
on 
the Constitutional amendment. They are being constrained. 
  [Lula] How many things have I already been forced to do 
while 
under constraint?! I had to expel a PT deputy although I was 
against doing it. This is no political constraint; it is the 
case of one deputy or another who might be more euphoric about 
participating in the amendment of the Constitution. The 
majority of bloc members see this as something normal. 
Disagreement within the PT is normal. If it had been war, do 
you think I would have been touring the country, leaving the 
party bloc alone? I would have stayed in Brasilia. The party 
will participate in the amendment of the Constitution at the 
time it feels it should. We do not want to endorse a policy of 
summary voting, which has been instituted by Deputy Nelson Jobim 
and the conservative wing. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Lima, 22 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Today, a poll revealed 
that 45 percent of Peruvians believe President Alberto Fujimori 
is in control, while a similar percentage of Peruvians believe 
the Armed Forces are in control. According to an Apoyo company 
poll, 45 percent of the population believes the chief of state 
holds power, but a similar percentage believes just the opposite. 
  The poll indicated that 70 percent of the population is 
aware 
that two weeks ago the ruling majority in Congress approved the 
controversial law transferring the case involving the 
disappearance of nine students and a professor from La Cantuta 
University to a military court. Meanwhile, 28 percent of 
Peruvians were not aware of the law, and 64 percent disapproved 
of it because they said such a law violates the autonomy of the 
Judicial Branch. 
  The Apoyo poll also revealed that 72 percent of the 
population believe the Armed Forces indeed pressured Congress to 
approve the law because members of the military institution are 
responsible for the kidnapping and subsequent July 1992 murder 
of the students and professor. Meanwhile, 26 percent believe 
these actions are justified because Peru is experiencing special 
circumstances due to the political violence carried out by 
subversive groups and the need to achieve complete peace. 
  Ruling party Congresswoman Martha Chavez said today that 
unlike what occurred in previous administrations, the Armed 
Forces are currently under the control of the Executive Branch. 
She emphasized that Fujimori, as commander in chief of the Armed 
Forces, issues the antisubversive strategy guidelines and that 
the military forces carry out his orders. Yesterday, Nicolas De 
Bari Hermoza, commander of the Armed Forces Joint Command and 
commander general of the Army, confirmed that the armed 
institutions are subordinate to the president thereby denying 
Fujimori is a "prisoner of the military forces," like a British 
newspaper recently reported. 
  President Fujimori's popularity has dropped from 66 to 58 
percent during the last few weeks. These figures, however, are 
moving further away from the 70 percent popularity rate he 
obtained in October 1993 and the 76 percent he achieved in June 
1992. Analysts believe the enactment of the so-called "Cantuta 
Law" significantly harmed the head of state's popularity. 
  Fujimori strengthened his administration with the support of 
the Armed Forces, especially the Army, after his self-inflicted 
coup on 5 April 1992, when he ordered the dissolution of 
Congress and the intervention of the Judicial Branch and other 
autonomous institutions. On 21 February, the president said such 
isolated cases as La Cantuta must not hinder the 
counterterrorism strategy his government is developing. He 
denied that high-ranking Army officers were involved in the 
disappearance of the students and professor, as minority 
opposition sectors in Congress claim.

  [Text] Lima, 22 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Members of the political 
opposition and Peruvian legal experts today termed as a "farce" 
the military trial against nine of 11 Army officers involved in 
the killing of 10 civilians. 
  The complaining parties stated their disagreement with the 
imposed sentences by saying the investigations in this case were 
neither thorough nor impartial, that the trial was not, in their 
opinion, "trustworthy," and that its objective was "to shield" 
Armed Forces and military intelligence top commanders . 
  The Military Court of the Supreme Council of Military 
Justice 
delivered sentences yesterday ranging from one to 20 years in 
prison against the individuals accused of kidnapping and 
murdering a professor and nine students of a Lima university 
named La Cantuta. 
  The event, which occurred early 18 July 1992, generated a 
confrontation between the political opposition and the Armed 
Forces, whose top commander, Nicolas Hermoza, went as far as 
warning he "would not tolerate" any campaign of discredit 
against the military institution. 
  Army Commander Hermoza and Presidential Adviser Vladimiro 
Montesinom, a member of the National Intelligence Service, have 
been accused by General Rodolfo Robles, who is self-exiled in 
Argentina for directing "death squadrons." The two have been 
accused of being involved in the La Cantuta case. 
  Saul Cuadros, one of the attorneys of relatives of the 
civilian victims, has said: "Everything indicates the 
government has politicized the objective of the process so that 
in a not too distant future the convicts may benefit from an 
amnesty or a pardon." Cuadros said during the trial, which was 
held behind closed doors and under strict security measures at 
the Simon Bolivar Barracks of Lima's Pueblo Libre District, no 
evidence was presented and no witness was called to the stand. 
  Enrique Bernales, a former UN Human Rights Commission 
relator, has affirmed no investigation has been carried out and 
that the quick sentencing indicates "everything was ready 
beforehand." He said the sentences were passed before the case 
was transferred to the military. The ruling came only 48 hours 
after the files on the case were received, and "it is impossible 
to read such a voluminous file in such a short period." 
  The government representatives have praised the military 
judges, though, noting the sentences are a "very good example" 
for the Andean country. 
  Carlos Torres, first vice president of the Peruvian 
Congress, 
has said the sentences have no precedent "in the legal history 
of Peru or Latin America." 
  President Alberto Fujimori has termed the sentences "drastic 
and exemplary," and he discarded the possibility of any member 
of the Armed Forces Command being involved in the death of the 
10 civilians, as relatives of the victims, the political 
opposition, and the independent media have charged. 
  Legislator Gloria Helfer, of the Democratic Left Movement, 
commenting on what Torres has said, stated the military court 
"can break any fast-reading world record after having read and 
analyzed a file containing thousands of pages." 
  Roger Caceres, former president of the Legislative Branch 
human rights commission, has said: "Sooner or later, the La 
Cantuta case will have to be reassessed in a legal and moral 
framework that is impartial and just." 
  Guatemalan Rigoberta Menchu, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who 
has visited Lima to inaugurate the first Latin American Rural 
Organizations Congress on 21 February, called for a more 
exemplary punishment for the military personnel and for the 
trial to be directed toward a civilian court. 
  The military court sentenced Majors Santiago Martin Rivas 
and 
Carlos Pichilingue Guevara to 20 years in prison. They were 
found guilty of being the direct authors of the crime and of 
having acted on their own, without the knowledge of the Armed 
Forces command staff. 
  To justify the transfer of the "La Cantuta" case to the 
military courts, Colonel Raul Talledo, the military prosecutor, 
has said the crime had been committed while on duty in an area 
that was in a state of emergency due to the political violence. 
  During the trial, which lasted three days, the military 
court 
also sentenced noncommissioned officers Julio Chuqui Aguirre, 
Jesus Sosa Saavedra, Nelson Carbajal Garcia, and Pedro Suppo 
Sanchez to 15 years in prison. 
  General Juan Rivero Lazo, who was director of Army 
intelligence when the military personnel raided "La Cantuta" 
University in eastern Lima, was sentenced to five years in 
prison, and Colonel Federico Navarro to two years. Both were 
found guilty of negligence. 
  Captain Jose Velarde Astete was given a year, the lowest 
sentence, as it was considered his participation in the crime 
had been minimal. 
  Furthermore, the military court absolved Col. Manuel Guzman 
Calderon and reserved its sentence on Lieutenant Aquilino 
Portella, who was tried in absence because he escaped to a 
foreign country.

  [Text] Lima, 25 Feb (DPA) -- A massive gathering in Lima 
this evening repudiated the "impunity" which prevailed 
concerning the assassination of 10 persons, given a military 
court's decision not to punish the people who reportedly planned 
the massacre. 
  The gathering occurred on the same day the European Union 
stated in a letter to the Peruvian Government its concern about 
the way in which the case had been handled -- a concern that has 
already been stated by the United States. 
  Today's event, held at San Martin Square in downtown Lima, 
was convoked by relatives of the 10 victims in the so-called "La 
Cantuta Case," and it received the support of human rights 
groups, student associations, professional colleges, and popular 
organizations. Gisela Ortiz, spokesperson of the victims' 
relatives, said the event was a protest against the "complicity" 
of the government, which created the conditions so the case 
could be handled by a military court rather than a civilian 
court, as hoped by relatives, the opposition, and independent 
observers. 
  The different speakers who addressed hundreds of 
demonstrators agreed in demanding the annulment of the 
controversial law which allowed a military court to handle the 
case and the subsequent annulment of the military trial which 
ended this week with sentences for nine of the people involved 
in the case. 
  Ortiz also said the relatives will continue to "stand 
around" 
indefinitely in front of the Justice Palace one and a half hours 
every Wednesday to protest against what has happened. 
  Today's event, which was carried out peacefully, was limited 
to a gathering at San Martin Square because the organizers could 
not get a permit to march from the 2 May Square to the Justice 
Palace, which was their goal. 
  Following a verbal trial which barely lasted four days, on 
Monday a military court passed sentences ranging between 15 and 
20 years for two Army majors and four NCO's, who, according to 
the evidence, actively participated in the event. It handed down 
sentences ranging between one and five years for three officers 
who were charged with negligence. The ruling, currently being 
reviewed by the Supreme Military Justice Court's examiner board 
because all the defendants appealed the sentence, was rejected 
by the victims' relatives and various groups because it fails to 
punish the people who planned the massacre and it states that 
the assassins acted on their own. 
  The massacre was perpetrated on 18 July 1992 by military 
personnel who seized the student residences at the state-owned 
La Cantuta University and kidnapped a professor and nine 
students. They were later assassinated and buried on the city's 
outskirts. 
  Prosecutor Victor Cubas, who was in charge of the case until 
the controversial law turned the case over to a military court, 
confirmed today that the operation had included the 
participation of at least 45 military personnel. Therefore, he 
cannot understand why sentences were only given to six persons.

  [Text] A bill presented by the Executive Branch to the CCD 
[Democratic Constituent Congress] seriously punishing the 
cultivation of poppy has just suffered its first defeat in legal 
experts' circles. According to the bill, the sentences range 
between 12 and 20 years of imprisonment and there is no room for 
procedural benefits. In the Andean Jurists Commission's (CAJ) 
opinion, this openly contradicts the so-called "Fujimori thesis" 
that was included in the 1991 penal code and no longer 
classifies cultivation as a drug trafficking crime. The 
Executive Branch's bill intends to radically eradicate this 
fairly new crop. The CAJ claims that if peasants raise this 
crop, it will be because its price is competitive and not 
because of fraudulent intention. The CAJ also claims that the 
punishment will not be a deterrent as long as poverty in the 
area prevails. The CAJ claims that the punishment might, 
rather, contribute to increasing prices and cases of corruption 
and abuse by producers, and an overwhelming growth in the prison 
population.

  [Text] PNP [Peruvian National Police] intelligence sources 
disclosed that Wilber Alvarado Linares, aka Champa, one of the 
main drug dealers in the Upper Huallaga, allegedly has taken the 
place of Demetrio Limoniel Chavez Penaherrera, aka Vaticano, as 
the main drug supplier for the Cali cartel. 
  Moreover, the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, barons of the 
cartel, allegedly have chosen to contact Champa to try to 
recover the advance they paid Vaticano to buy white cocaine 
paste. 
  According to our sources, the arrest of Vaticano in Cali, 
Colombia, will represent a hard blow to the Rodriguez Orejuelas' 
"economy" if they fail to identify the "buyers" who received an 
advance for the purchase of a "large quantity" of drugs. 
  Other traffickers such as "Camboya," "Escorpio," "Santena," 
"Joselito," "Chuquin," "Mecano," "Tico," "Nano," etc., who also 
have "interests" in the Upper Huallaga might also be affected 
for having given Vaticano an advance of several thousands of 
dollars. 
  In this regard, it was learned that Elias Chavez 
Penaherrera, 
aka Lan, who is Vaticano's brother and the pilot of his private 
aircraft, may take Vaticano's place because he knows his 
"contacts" and probably the drug buyers who received the advance 
payment from the Cali cartel. 
  Moreover, the National Intelligence Service has discovered 
that Vaticano and the aforementioned drug traffickers had their 
operations center in the Upper Huallaga, Palma Pampa, Ramal de 
Aspuzana, Huicungo, "Boca de Diablo," Bellavista, and Bolognesi 
Province. 
  As for Demetrio Limoniel Chavez Penaherrera, it was learned 
that the Intelligence Services as well as Dinandro [Anti-Drug 
Division] are after several of his front men whose names are 
being kept secret and other people also involved in drug 
trafficking.

  [Text] Although it is the first time since 1904 the United 
States has admitted that drug trafficking is also a U.S. 
domestic problem, expectations regarding the U.S. Government's 
change of attitude regarding countries such as Peru and Bolivia 
are not very encouraging because "in their capacity as 
producers, they will be abandoned to their fate; they will be 
given no aid and no importance will be granted to alternative 
development crops (for coca leaves)". 
  This statement was made on 10 February by the UN expert on 
drug affairs and agricultural development, Iban de Rementeria, 
who said the change in the antidrug strategy announced on 9 
February by U.S. President Bill Clinton represents a "complete 
change in U.S. anti- drug policy." 
  De Rementeria said: "Since 1904 the United States has 
maintained that drugs are a foreign problem. This is the first 
time they have admitted it is a domestic problem. This is a 
step forward because they admit that it is a health and 
educational problem and not just a police issue." 
  The UN official believes this change of attitude regarding 
the drug problem was promoted by the failure of the U.S. 
administration's antidrug policy, which during the past few 
years cost more than $10 billion per year. 
  "Drug consumption in the United States has really not 
dropped. During the past six years the number of consumers has 
remained more or less the same," he said as he commented that it 
is estimated there are 10 million cocaine and marijuana addicts 
in the United States. 
  In referring to Clinton's new strategy, de Rementeria said: 
"We must not have illusions because we remain alone in this 
field." 
  From his viewpoint, the importance of reducing or 
substituting coca crops has become a secondary issue. 
  De Rementeria added: "I do not see how we can plan an 
alternative development program with the current international 
agricultural policies if the GATT Uruguay Round has 
institutionalized subsidies in developed countries and this 
condemns agriculture in the Third World to failure."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Peasant and the New Antinarcotics Strategy"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton recently announced a 
drastic change in the U.S. Government's antinarcotics strategy. 
  The idea is to emphasize prevention rather than repression 
which, generally speaking, has been used since, or even before 
the tenure of President George Bush. 
  One reason for the change of strategy is that the one used 
so 
far has proven ineffective and only increased the number of 
consumers by an average of 140,000 new addicts per year to the 
incredible current number of 10 million consumers. 
  At the same time as it announced the so-called New National 
Antinarcotics Strategy, the White House also asked the U.S. 
Congress to approve a $13.2-billion allocation to implement this 
program. This includes a substantial increase in the funds 
earmarked for cooperation with drug producer countries. 
  This directly concerns us because Peru is the world's 
biggest 
coca leaf producer and the money allocated for cooperation is 
earmarked for eradicating plantations and destroying 
laboratories. 
  U.S. Government officials have said that this money -- which 
will not reach Peru or Bolivia until October -- will also be 
used to strengthen the Peruvian and Bolivian judicial systems 
and to train their respective specialized police units. 
  Despite a relative increase, and the strategy implemented in 
Peru, the main changes by U.S. officials do not seem positive. 
  Iban de Rementeria -- a UN expert in narcotics affairs and 
agricultural development who termed the U.S. strategy "a 
complete turn around" -- has stated that although it is right 
that the United States has admitted for the first time since 
1904 that the drug problem is a domestic problem, there are 
other aspects that reveal faults in the new strategy as far as 
our countries are concerned. 
  Rementeria said: "There should be no illusions because we 
continue alone in this field," adding that prospects for Peru 
and Bolivia are not good because "in their capacity as producers 
they will be abandoned to their fate, they will be given no aid, 
and no importance will be granted to the alternative development 
crops." 
  To a certain extent, the current international agricultural 
policies upheld by the GATT are even more serious because the 
recent Uruguay Round has institutionalized the subsidy system in 
developed countries, condemning agriculture in the Third World 
"to failure." 
  Bolivian Chamber of Deputies President Guillermo Bedregal 
has 
mentioned the serious social conflicts that would be unleashed 
in his country following a cut in the alternative development 
program. 
  As we can see, it is not just a matter of a mere 
substitution 
of plantations, which to a great extend has failed because a 
series of complementary aspects -- such as guaranteeing peasants 
access to market -- were overlooked. 
  Alternative development is what is sought and needed now; so 
that the coca grower's problems will be tackled in a 
comprehensive way, that the peasant will by no means be regarded 
as a delinquent or an accomplice, but merely a producer with 
limited possibilities and without an "alternative" -- for the 
time being -- to survive. 
  The solution to the immensely complex trafficking problem 
must, therefore, contemplate the problem of the peasants -- who 
are on many occasions involuntarily and exploited producers of 
the raw material -- whose needs and interests must also be 
considered.

  [Excerpts] General Jaime Salinas Sedo -- who has been 
described by Amnesty International as a prisoner of conscience 
-- will celebrate his 58th birthday on 23 February at the Real 
Felipe prison where he is serving an eight year sentence for 
attempting to restore the broken democratic institutional order 
in the country, an effort considered "a crime" in present day 
Peru. 
  He is allowed visitors on Wednesdays. His wife Isabel, his 
closest relatives and friends, and his colleagues who share the 
prison with him have promised to organize a barbecue to 
celebrate his birthday during the two-hour visit allowed by the 
prison. 
  Outside the Real Felipe prison, however, his assistants and 
friends are organizing another celebration: The birth of the 13 
November Movement (M-13), a nonpolitical organization created 
with the objective of obtaining amnesty for military officers 
imprisoned at Real Felipe and the vindication of the name of 
those who suffered ill-treatment or persecution following the 13 
November 1992 constitutional rebellion. 
  The M-13 will be officially launched on 18 February (the 
first anniversary of Sedo's sentencing) during a news conference 
"somewhere in Lima." The place will be announced only hours 
before to prevent interference from SIN [National Intelligence 
Service] agents. The founding documents will be signed on 20 
February during a spartan ceremony that is expected to take 
place at the Real Felipe prison yard before the arrested 
military officers. 
  The M-13 is inspired by a UN resolution that condemns the 
imprisonment of the constitutionalist officers, and by a growing 
national and international support for the rebels release. It 
promises a hard legal battle that will create headaches for the 
military leadership that rules the country from behind the 
presidential chair. 
  Surveys show that Salinas Sedo has the important support of 
6 
percent of the voters. He has become a serious presidential 
alternative, creating a new front to compete against Javier 
Perez de Cuellar and Ricardo Belmont's possible candidacies. 
  For this reason the sponsors of M-13 stress: "The movement 
seeks amnesty for the arrested military officers and a ban on 
partisan politics in the barracks. The movement seeks to 
contribute to Peru's democratic stabilization through the 
support of all the institutions and individuals who want to live 
in a country where the Constitution prevails over authoritarian 
adventures." 
  In an interview on the Radio Miraflores "Double Meaning" 
program, Javier Valle Riestra defined Salinas Sedo's possible 
presidential candidacy in these terms: "Some people go to jail 
from powerful positions, others rise to power from jail. 
General Salinas is a Peruvian citizen imprisoned for defending 
the Constitution. He is willing to fight for democracy. He has 
a military background and a seducing Peruvian character. This 
is why he must be pardoned. His sentence does not disqualify 
him from participating in elections." [passage omitted] 
  We wanted to ask Salinas Sedo his opinion on the "Cantuta 
Law" which the CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] approved 
rather hastily. [passage omitted] 
  There were rumors of a possible coup the day the CCD 
approved 
the measure. Salinas Sedo was aware of the problem: "The rumor 
might be true, but a coup now would be entirely wrong. We must 
allow Fujimori to complete his term. We want the people to 
realize that his perpetuation in power is not good for the 
country." 
  Salinas Sedo showed more concern for the possible 
consequences of the arrest of drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez 
Panaherrera, alias "Vaticano." I do not know if "Vaticano's 
report is correct, but if it is, it will have very serious 
repercussions and the effects will be worse than the revolt 
created by La Cantuta because the corruption caused by 
traffickers can destroy the Peruvian Army." [passage omitted] 
  Concerning the National Police "reorganization" following 
the 
guidelines established by the SIN, Salinas Sedo recognized that 
many organizations need reorganizing. He said: "I do not 
understand why the government is seeking to minimize the 
activities of Dincote which, paradoxically, has given the 
government its best results. The only reason is the egoist and 
jealous attitude of the SIN."

<F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The brand-new 13 November Civic Movement has 
demanded the release of the Army officers who are serving 
sentences at San Felipe. One year after the military court 
sentenced 25 Army officers to prison for an alleged coup d'etat 
attempt, leaders of the 13 November Civic Movement said this was 
an unconstitutional ruling, therefore it is invalid. 
  General Luis Pastor Vives, president of the organizing 
committee, called for the release of his comrades in arms, 
arguing that the government's uncompromising position had 
priority even though favorable circumstances exist, like the 
promulgation of the new Constitution. A message from Gen. 
Salinas Sedo was transmitted during a news conference in which 
he expressed his disagreement with his sentence although he 
emphasized he preferred prison to an undignified freedom. 
Meanwhile, his attorney indicated that Congress should pass an 
amnesty law for the prisoners.

  [Text] Although the PNP [Peruvian National Police] high 
command has denied it, over 20 PNP officers assigned to the 
National Counterterrrorism Directorate (Dincote), were 
transferred over the last few days to the National Intelligence 
Service (SIN). 
  Reliable sources have informed EXPRESO that the transfers 
occurred at the end of January, and that it included a 
high-ranking Dincote colonel and other PNP unit chiefs. 
  It must be noted that EXPRESO was the first to report, at 
the 
beginning of February, that the PNP had implemented a 30 percent 
reduction in Dincote personnel. 
  This reduction is part of the announced "streamlining" of 
police force personnel, which was disclosed not so long ago by 
PNP General Director Victor Alva Plasencia. 
  According to the same source, Dincote has already submitted 
to the PNP General Staff the names of the 300 Dincote agents who 
will be fired. 
  The officer added that it is still unknown whether all of 
these agents will be transferred to the SIN or to other police 
units, and that this situation is causing uncertainty among 
Dincote personnel.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Fujimori Denies Any Negotiation"] </F>
  [Text] During his short trip to Colombia (which seems to 
have been a total success), President Alberto Fujimori denied he 
had been negotiating with Abimael Guzman and other imprisoned 
Shining Path leaders. The president also denied that he wanted 
to reduce Guzman's sentence to life imprisonment. 
  The president was obviously answering an alarming piece of 
news disseminated by television on 16 February, according to 
which the government signed a 10-point "peace agreement" with 
Guzman that included an item on improving Guzman's prison 
conditions and ended with a general amnesty for him and his 
henchmen. 
  It was good for Fujimori to have denied in Bogota the 
existence of such a pact because it worried some groups of 
people -- which possibly constitute a majority of the population 
-- who worry more about the severity with which they think 
terrorists should be treated than for the alleged trampling of 
their human rights. 
  These groups reacted with indignation when President 
Fujimori 
said he had granted Guzman and Iparraguirre preferential 
treatment in order to get them to write the letters calling for 
peace. This indignation was reflected in the polls at the time. 
We will never know how many "Yes" votes [for the approval of the 
new Constitution] he lost with that revelation. 
  He should not then repeat the mistake by stumbling on the 
same rock again. Guzman's letters had the positive effect of 
creating great confusion among Shining Path cadres, true, and 
encouraging a split between their leaders and militants. But 
they have not stopped the violence, which has continued. This 
continued violence has made many people doubt government 
policies on the matter, believing that they are unnecessarily 
indulgent with individuals who do not deserve anything other 
than the harshest punishment. 
  In fact, as we proposed in this column earlier, the 
efficient 
Justice Minister Fernando Vega Santa-Gadea should make public a 
detailed report on Guzman's imprisonment conditions and what 
assurances we have that he will not be able to leave his jail 
until the end of his days. The television crew who filmed him 
without his striped uniform, warmly calling for an unconvincing 
pacification, should now show us where he is and who he is 
talking to. 
  Because we still have the bitter taste of his letter with 
instructions to Scandinavian Shining Path followers, which was 
first published by EXPRESO, and the fact that no one was able to 
explain how the letter left the jail, first, and how it left the 
country, second.

<F P=106> [Report by Edgar Augusto Sanchez for the "TV Today" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Eastern Colombia has the most extensive guerrilla 
presence, especially in Santander, Norte de Santander, and Cesar 
Departments. Despite an Army deployment in that area, 
guarantees for the normal development of the electoral process 
have not been given. 
  The Army troop deployment was prompted by harassment by 
subversices of nearly 80 towns in Santander, southern Cesar, 
Bolivar, northeast Antioquia, and Arauca Departments. In 
Santander, seven National Liberation Army fronts, six 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia fronts, and one Popular 
Liberation Army front are surrounding towns like 
Barrancabermeja, Puerto Wilches, Sabana de Torres, Rio Negro, 
Provincia de Velez, and Provincia de Garcia Rovira. In (Chima) 
and (Guacota) municipalities in Provincia Comunera, where 
subversives had never gone before, members of the 46th Front 
asked local residents not to vote, and some voter cards were 
stolen. Political groups have begun to abandon southern Cesar 
Department, especially Agua Chica, in response to the violence. 
Nearly 200,000 members of the Army and the Santander Department 
police force are trying to stop the guerrilla incursion. . 
  [Begin General Manuel Jose Bonet, 2d Brigade commander, 
recording] I ask the people to go to the polls and vote. The 
best way people can fight is to vote and show the enemies of the 
fatherland that society will not be frightened. [end recording] 
  However, political supporters in the department are afraid 
and very aware of the few guarantees available to them as they 
have stopped traveling to the countryside. People here 
represent 60 percent of all voters. 
  [Begin recording] [Carlos Plata, candidate for Congress] The 
Army offered us nine sites to land, but when we arrived here, we 
could not land in four of them. 
  [Police Commander Hugo Lozano] We have provided security to 
all politicians who have requested it. [end recording] 
  By increasing the number of personnel in the entire 
department, the Army and the police hope to overcome the 
difficult obstacles presented by the guerrillas during the 
electoral process.

  [Text] The top leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia [FARC] told TV Today that they will not sabotage the 13 
March elections and that they are drafting a political proposal 
for the country. They also promised not to kidnap any more 
mayors, but they warned that they will continue with their 
military actions until they achieve a peace agreement. Because 
of legal reasons we cannot transmit the voices of those who were 
interviewed, but in the next report we are going to present the 
basic points of their proposals. 
  The FARC members said they will not sabotage the next 
elections and guaranteed that people will be able to vote 
without any problems on 13 March. We absolutely agree the people 
should be allowed to express themselves by voting for the 
candidates they want as their representatives. We are not going 
to sabotage the elections because we believe it is the right of 
all our fellow countrymen, they said. 
  The FARC members note that if some politicians were withheld 
it was only temporarily and only to discuss their positions. We 
may decide to talk to someone as it is the only option we have. 
That is part of the activities conducted by each front, they 
said. 
  The FARC said they would continue to promote a proposal for 
a 
national reconstruction government. To achieve that they will 
continue to carry out propaganda activities and said the 
confrontation situation will continue. As long as there are no 
agreements the guerrillas will continue to operate. We are 
strong and have many possibilities, the FARC leaders said. 
  They say steps have been taken to join the National 
Liberation Army, and they support the peace process between the 
government and the Socialist Renewal Current. They say anything 
done for peace in Colombia is fine with them. 
  As for possible dialogues between the National Guerrilla 
Coordinating Board and the government, they say the time is not 
right and that the solution to the guerrilla problem is linked 
to the solution of the country's big problems.

  [Text] Talks with attorneys representing Cali cartel

prisons and cooperation that should be shown by those criminals 
who have expressed their willingness to surrender. 
  [Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez] First we discussed the 
need to have these drug traffickers imprisoned in maximum 
security prisons. Second, we said their cooperation with the 
justice system must be efficient as [word indistinct] the 
surrender policy. 
  [Sanchez] The various organizations that participated in the 
meeting -- the Administrative Department of Security, the 
Prosecutor General's Office, and the Justice Ministry -- will 
review the proposals presented by the drug traffickers' 
representative, and the parties will meet again in eight days. 
  The government expects those criminals who surrender to 
cooperate efficiently with the system; that is, to provide 
evidence that can be used to prosecute other criminals and to 
help dismantle laboratories and drug trafficking networks. [end

<F P=106> [Interview with Colombian Prosecutor General Gustavo de </F>
Greiff by Felix de Bedout on 26 February; place not given; from 
the "NTC News" newscast -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [De Bedout] Prosecutor General, what progress was 
made toward the surrender of Cali Cartel members during the 
meeting held yesterday? 
  [De Greiff] We made significant progress in stipulating the 
guidelines for cooperation and settling the details regarding 
the prison where they will stay. 
  [De Bedout] Which prison will it be? 
  [De Greiff] I think it will be one of the two 
maximum-security prisons that already exist in Valle Department, 
such as Palmira and Cali. 
  [De Bedout] This surrender process has been very 
controversial. Has the Prosecutor General's Office gone out of 
its way to facilitate the conditions for Cali Cartel members to 
surrender? 
  [De Greiff] No, no. I believe that the criminals' surrender 
and incarceration will not only benefit the country, but we will 
also be making progress toward defeating drug trafficking. 
  In the United States -- for reasons I do not understand very 
well -- they believe the fight against drug trafficking is 
useless and that only drug traffickers should be targeted. They 
argue that ending drug trafficking is an impossible mission, so 
they say the best course is to fight drug traffickers and try to 
stop as many of them as possible. Thus their war against drug 
trafficking has not been very successful. 
  I believe that both objectives -- that drug traffickers pay 
for their crimes against society and that efforts be made to end 
drug trafficking -- should be tackled. In Colombia's the 
current situation -- and we are not being naive or too 
optimistic -- we might be able to defeat drug trafficking, at 
least in some areas of the country. In addition, we might be 
able to reduce the territory of those drug traffickers who want 
to continue their criminal activities. Gradually we can 
continue fighting them and reducing their territory even further 
until eventually -- God willing -- we can defeat this scourge. 
  [De Bedout] But do you believe that legalization would 
constitute a definitive cure? 
  [De Greiff] This issue requires more time and more research 
by economists, sociologists, doctors, chemists. I have only 
said that legalization is a possibility that must be considered. 
We must destroy the profits made by drug traffickers so this 
crime becomes less tempting and is eventually stamped out. 
  I reiterate: Colombia cannot do this unilaterally; it must 
be a multilateral action. We must promote research regarding 
this possibility and in the meantime continue our relentless 
fight on both fronts: against drug traffickers and drug 
trafficking. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From "TV Today" newscast] </F>
  [Text] An investigation by the Prosecutor General's Office 
has indicated that drug traffickers from northern Valle del 
Cauca Department planned to prevent the arrival of U.S. Marines 
and to halt the Colombian Navy's intelligence network on the 
Colombian Pacific coast. 
  According to the Prosecutor General's Office, the plan 
included the hiring of two noncommissioned officers to accuse 
Navy Colonel Rodrigo Quinonez and other officers of the murder 
of more than 100 leftist leaders and labor union leaders from 
the Barrancabermeja area. 
  The Colombian Navy's intelligence network was established in 
August 1991 to fight gunrunning and drug trafficking activities 
on the Colombian Pacific coast. Drug traffickers later 
determined that Captain Juan Carlos Alvarez was responsible for 
establishing the network. Alvarez was then transferred to 
Barrancabermeja, where he organized the Navy's intelligence 
network along the Magdalena River. His mission was to uncover 
possible guerrilla attack plans. 
  In January 1993 Capt. Alvarez was transferred to Cartagena, 
where he was murdered on 6 August of that same year. According 
to the Prosecutor General's Office investigation, the captain 
was murdered by drug traffickers from Valle del Cauca. Jorge 
Hernan Gil has been identified as one of the hired assassins who 
murdered Alvarez. The Prosecutor General's Office also 
determined that a great deal of information had reached the drug 
traffickers in Valle del Cauca Department by way of Saulo 
Segura, an NCO who had worked on the Pacific network and who, 
along with Juan Carlos Lopez Maquilon, accused Col. Rodrigo 
Quinonez and other Navy officers of murdering more than 100 
leftist leaders and labor union leaders in Barrancabermeja. 
  The connection of both NCO's with the Cali Cartel is 
mentioned in statements made by several witnesses to the 
Prosecutor General's Office. Once the officers' connections 
were discovered, the drug traffickers hired four lawyers and 
sent the two NCO's to testify against the Navy intelligence 
chief and against several Pacific network officers. According 
to documents in the hands of the Prosecutor General's Office, 
the cartel intended to undermine the work done by the Navy 
intelligence network and prevent the arrival of the gringos in 
Juanchaco. 
  The Prosecutor General's Office uncovered this plan after 
three months of investigation, but the Cali Cartel was able to 
achieve one of its objective: to dismantle the Navy's 
intelligence network on the Pacific coast. 
  This week the Prosecutor General's Office issued arrest 
warrants against the two NCO's, but they have disappeared. One 
of them was taken out of the country.

<F P=106> [From the "TV Today" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. Marines have advanced their departure from 
Juanchaco on the Pacific Coast. Only 40 of the 156 U.S. 
soldiers who came to build a school and a health center remain. 
The worrisome part is that "TV Today" has learned that their 
mission was to bury toxic waste in Malaga Bay and that they may 
return in 20 days to complete their work. 
  After 62 days of uncertainty and of not believing a single 
word about the facilities that supposedly would be built by the 
U.S. soldiers in Juanchaco, finally the soldiers, Marines, 
engineers, or whatever they were packed their incredible tons of 
cargo, containers, trucks, and machinery and began their long 
journey to Panama. In Juanchaco, however, there is even more 
uncertainty today. A worrisome rumor is circulating on the 
island that the gringo soldiers did not come to build facilities 
but to bury toxic waste in Colombian territory. Those rumors 
are cause for concern among residents. 
  Out of 156 U.S. soldiers, not even the 40 who stayed and who 
will leave tomorrow from the naval base in Malaga Bay received 
any explanation for this action, which now explains the real 
reason for their presence in our country. What worries the 
people most is that last Wednesday a U.S.-flagged ship was asked 
to leave our territory because it carried a shipment of toxic 
waste. The incident has increased the people's fears and they 
are afraid to report the case to the media. They merely express 
their frustration because the work was not completed. 
  [Begin unidentified resident recording] Now that the work is 
in Colombian hands, we wonder if it will be finished because an 
airport has been under construction for a long time, and it is 
still incomplete. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, the U.S. soldiers said they have no knowledge of 
the case and that they have nothing to do with it. They also 
expressed their respect and appreciation for Colombia and said 
they are leaving with the best impression. 
  [Begin unidentified U.S. soldier recording, in English with 
superimposed translation into Spanish] We must go home because 
we have completed our work in Juanchaco. [end recording] 
  A U.S. soldier told "TV Today" that 20 days after the 
elections, a new contingent of U.S. troops will return to Malaga 
Bay. 
  Meanwhile, we visited the school and health center that are 
only half finished. Only the roof and walls confirm that U.S. 
soldiers were indeed there at least trying to build those 
facilities. Colombian troops, not U.S. soldiers, will work on 
repairing the airport's runway, which has been practically 
destroyed.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino has said Panama is 
not involved in any cases of expropriation of properties, as a 
U.S. senator is claiming. Mulino has said U.S. Senator Jesse 
Helms' assertion about the alleged confiscation of U.S. 
companies has nothing to do with the situation in this country. 
  [Begin Mulino recording] In Senator Jesse Helms' statement 
on 
this topic, he only mentioned Panama within a group of 
countries, but none of the cases mentioned by Senator Helms 
refer to events that have occurred in Panama; therefore, if 
there was some mention, it was totally accidental by Senator 
Helms. 
  According to the information that Ambassador Ford 
[Panamanian 
ambassador to the United States] gave me a few minutes ago, 
Helms did not refer to a specific case in Panama. The only one 
that occurs to me which he could have mentioned is the one 
concerning the official residence of our embassy in Managua. 
That case is not one involving a conflict, because Panama told 
the Nicaraguan Government more than one year ago the moment it 
wants the house, it will be returned. [end recording] 
  The foreign minister added the house had been given to the 
Noriega government by the Sandinist government without any 
specific agreement; therefore, Panama is willing to return that 
house as soon as the Nicaraguan Government so requests.

  [Text] In a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton dated 24 
February, 14 Haitian people's organizations expressed their 
concerns in view of the latest developments in the Haitian 
crisis resulting from the September 1991 coup d'etat. Among the 
groups writing were the following: the Sun of Justice for the 
Liberation of the Haitian People, OSJLPH, [Organisation Soleil 
Justice pour la Liberation du Peuple Haitien, also known as 
Soley Jistis pou Liberasyon Pep Ayisyen, OSJLPA], the 
Organization for the Defense of Youth, ODEJ, [Organisation de la 
Defense de la Jeunesse], and the St. John Bosco basic church 
communities. 
  The letter's signatories reproached President Clinton, among 
others, for his indifference in the face of the current climate 
of deterioration in the country, including an upsurge in acts of 
violence, both in the capital and in the provincial cities. 
  The 14 people's organizations wrote the following: We 
deplore 
your silence about the horrors (?being committed) in Haiti. By 
acting thus, you send a conspiratorial signal to the Haitian 
military and to the armed civilians who continue to slaughter 
the population. Remember that Americans of Haitian origin voted 
for you because they were convinced that your presence in the 
White House would inaugurate a new era for Haiti. 
  Mr. President, one cannot avoid noting that again today you 
are putting pressure on President Aristide to appoint a new 
prime minister, but the current climate is not really 
appropriate for that, the signatories of the letter pointed out. 
  They further demand the departure of General Cedras, the 
disarming of the paramilitary groups, and the return of 
President Aristide on a specific date.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Cuban Foreign Ministry on 26 </F>
February in Havana -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] The Cuban people express their profound indignation 
over the horrendous massacre committed on 25 February at the 
Ibrahim Mosque in the West Bank town of Hebron, an occupied 
territory of Palestine, against the numerous faithful who were 
there performing their Muslim religious rituals. 
  This genocidal action came at a time when, despite the 
enormous obstacles still to be overcome, limited progress is 
being made in the slow and protracted process of negotiations 
between the organizations [as heard] and PLO representatives 
seeking to consolidate the agreement signed in September 1993 on 
Palestinian sovereignty over the Gaza Strip and the Jericho zone. 
  Simultaneously, a number of rounds of negotiations were 
being 
held between Israel and its neighboring Arab states, encouraged 
in the objective of achieving a just and long-lasting peace that 
would benefit all peoples of the region, based on the full 
recognition of their inalienable rights. 
  Savage actions like those carried out in Hebron do not 
contribute to the climate of mutual understanding and trust that 
could pave the way for the cherished peace; on the contrary, 
they stir up the passions of hatred and vengeance and deepen the 
wounds of the peoples, in this case, the long-suffering 
Arab-Palestinian people. 
  Although the top Israeli officials have promised to 
investigate the events and to impose justice on the perpetrators 
of the crime, it will be very difficult to restore the climate 
of confidence that will promote the complex and difficult 
process of the quest for regional peace. 
  It is unquestionable that the enemies of peace in the Middle 
East have inflicted a heavy blow on efforts being made in this 
regard. The Ministry of Foreign Relations of the Republic of 
Cuba wishes to extend to the friendly Palestinian people the 
feelings of solidarity and sympathy of the Cuban people on the 
occasion of this horrible tragedy; at the same time, it hopes 
that the Israeli Government officials will adopt immediate 
measures to prevent the repetition of such genocidal actions 
against the Arab-Palestinian people of the occupied territories. 
  In this moment of sorrow and suffering, we want to reaffirm 
the irrevocable solidarity of the Cuban people and Government 
with the just cause of the Palestinian people, to whom we ratify 
our support of their efforts in the quest for peace and for the 
full recognition of their inalienable right to build their own 
independent and sovereign state. 
  [Signed] Havana, 26 February 1994.

  [Text] Some 30 U.S. congressmen have expressed their 
support for a bill to lift the blockade of Cuba, which will be 
discussed next month at the initiative of U.S. Representative 
Charles Rangel. In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Rangel's 
spokesman, [name indistinct], said that hearings will begin on 
17 March in two House of Representatives committees, and 
although the bill will not be submitted to a vote, these 
hearings will serve to broach the subject. 
  The document was sent to the capitol in May 1993, bearing 
the 
title, "Bill for Free Trade With Cuba," and although it did not 
receive the support of the entire Congress, it became an 
important point of discussion both inside and outside the 
Legislative Branch. 
  In a letter to the U.S. Government, (?Congressman) Rangel 
asked why the United States trades with Vietnam, China, and 
Russia, yet cannot do so with Cuba. 
  Rangel's bill -- Rangel is one of the U.S. Legislature's 
black leaders -- is supported by another 30 legislators who 
argue that it is the population of Cuba that has suffered the 
damages caused by the embargo. According to spokesman [name 
indistinct], Rangel gets calls from people all over the United 
States who wish to show their support for lifting the blockade 
against Cuba, people who also inform the government of their 
interest in a change of policy toward Havana. 
  He pointed out that the legislator has also received strong 
support from large groups within the Cuban community who live 
not only in Miami, but in, among other places, New York, New 
Jersey, and Chicago. He said there has been a recent increase in 
the number of voices from various parts of the United States who 
are calling for the lifting of the embargo against Cuba, 
including those who were formerly in favor of the embargo.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 25 Feb (EFE) -- 
"Subcommander Marcos," leader of the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army (EZLN) today reiterated that Mexican President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari should resign. The rebel leader added 
that although the government's resignation will not be decided 
at the dialogue he is holding with Peace Commissioner Manuel 
Camacho Solis in San Cristobal de las Casas, "we still have to 
state our position at the national level, whether individually 
or at the bargaining table." 
  The Zapatist leader said: "The federal government, the 
federal executive branch, and its cabinet should resign, because 
how can this government guarantee that the people's will, as 
expressed at the polls, be respected when the government has 
already defined its position from the outset in favor of one of 
the candidates?" 
  President Salinas' resignation and other points concerning 
democracy are among the political demands made by the EZLN since 
its 1 January insurrection in the southeastern Mexican state of 
Chiapas. 
  Noting that "no one can be both judge and jury," Marcos said 
there should be a transition government whose members should not 
belong to any political party, or a government formed out of an 
agreement among the various political parties, which will then 
be able to organize the 21 August presidential elections. 
  Marcos said the regional conflict will not be resolved 
"unless there is a radical, fundamental change -- a deep-rooted 
change that will support a solution. [no closing quotation marks 
as received] 
  Marcos added that southern Mexico (Chiapas, Tabasco, 
Yucatan, 
Campeche, and Quintana Roo) is the most exploited region in 
Mexico -- an area "where more resources are extracted and less 
benefits are received, a situation that will only worsen under 
NAFTA." Marcos said NAFTA "will designate the southeastern 
region as a banana republic, but instead of a banana-growing 
region, it will be an oil and electricity region." He added, 
"The country will be divided, and poverty in the southeast will 
increase to even more unimaginable and inhuman levels, worse 
than those seen in Somalia." 
  With regard to the progress made at the Chiapas peace talks 
now under way at the San Cristobal Cathedral, Marcos reiterated 
that the Indian groups have been very clear in stating that the 
resolution of problems must be at a national level. 
  "The toughest and most difficult part" of the negotiations 
is 
still pending, Marcos stressed. He attributed the spectacular 
progress and coverage of 50 percent of the agenda to the fact 
that the talks began by dealing with the least divisive issues 
"to send a signal to the country that peace, perhaps, is 
possible."

assembly member candidates. The ticket is headed by Fernando 
Pino Solanas, followed by Mary Sanchez, Carlos Auyero, and Juan 
Pablo Cafiero. 
  The center-left alliance delayed the release of its 
candidates' ticket due to a controversy that arose especially 
over the third place, which was sought by "Juampi" Cafiero, 
Auyero, and the People's Encounter [Encuentro Popular] party. 
  The two first places on the ticket and the merits of Juan 
Pablo Cafiero (one of the FG constitutional reform bill's 
drafters) were not objected to by anyone. The problem was that, 
according to some leaders, the FG ticket had a heavy Peronist 
bias with "Juampi" in third place, and the pluralist composition 
advocated by the FG people was therefore reduced. 
  Afterward, there were tugs of war between the People's 
Encounter and the New Progressive Space [Nuevo Espacio 
Progresista] leaders. The New Progressive Space leaders finally 
managed to place Auyero in the third place. In addition to 
having a long political record, Auyero is a constitutional law 
professor. 
  Auyero is followed by Maria Ines Brasesco from the Union of 
Argentine Women, Dario Torres Molinas from the People's 
Encounter, and Gustavo Cardessa from the Christian Democratic 
Party.

<F P=106> [News conference by Honduran President Carlos Reina with </F>
unidentified reporters at the Government House in Tegucigalpa on 
23 February; monitored in progress -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Reina] The international community has 
questioned me a great deal about the Palmerola situation. This 
is a very sensitive issue, particularly in the international 
context. [words indistinct] In my opinion, the Palmerola base 
resulted from an military agreement [words indistinct] It is not 
a formal treaty; it was not submitted to the National Congress. 
Based on this agreement, [words indistinct] it was theoretically 
established that it was a [words indistinct] base. 
  The Cold War has ended. What happens to this installation? 
Can it be utilized -- with international cooperation -- for the 
benefit of the Honduran people and the United States? Can it be 
used to combat such a threatening and damaging scourge as drug 
trafficking? Can it be used for [words indistinct] ecology, or 
to help control disease, or to improve the transfer of 
technology in the agriculture sector, or to help in the health 
sector? All of this will have to be discussed in due time at the 
National Congress. The National Congress will decide this. I 
will even go further. We could ask the people of Comayagua, who 
are directly affected, what they think about the presence of the 
installation there. I strenuously opposed war activities there, 
as they only bring us destruction. [passage omitted] 
  We are talking about privatization in general, not about one 
particular company. The simplest example would be [words 
indistinct]. This was taboo some time ago, one could not talk 
about this. I am very happy that currently we can talk about the 
privatization of a hotel or of any other institution. The 
privatization issue is neither good or bad in itself. It all 
depends on what is being privatized and how it is being 
privatized as this can lead to widespread corruption or it can 
serve to help Honduras' economic independence. In this way, we 
would not have to face situations arising from the payment of 
the foreign debt. A total of 43 percent of the Honduran budget 
is used to pay the foreign debt. If we add what goes to pay 
bureaucracy to this, we are facing a truly dramatic situation. 
Some institutions have told me that almost 90 percent of their 
budget is used to pay for administration. After that, what is 
left for the institution's goals? What I want to tell you is 
that we have not discussed [word indistinct] appears in the 
press; we have not started to discuss this. Nevertheless, we 
have initiated discussions on Hondutel [Honduran 
Telecommunications Enterprise]. This has an even more profound 
effect on Honduran economy. 
  [Unidentified reporter] On the Palmerola issue, can you give 
us more details. Will your government send the foreign troops, 
the American troops, deployed there away, or are they going to 
stay? 
  [Reina] [words indistinct] is still pending, but I can give 
you some hints. I believe we should see if it is good for 
Honduras -- taking into account international cooperation -- to 
maintain the installations. We must take into account 1) this is 
a Honduran base; 2) the arguments for and against this 
installation will be discussed at the National Congress, and 3) 
the people must be directly asked what is their opinion on this 
matter. The international context changed from a Cold War to an 
agenda of international cooperation. 
  As far as Hondutel is concerned, there are two firm 
proposals. One is from [name indistinct], which was published in 
the press. I believe it is very attractive and very [word 
indistinct] proposal. Why this? Well, because there is a way to 
take advantage of these [words indistinct] and to become more 
efficient as an institution. 
  [Reporter] Have the Armed Forces begun the debate on 
privatization? 
  [Reina] This all depends on whether we are convinced it is 
good for Honduras. In any case, I have firmly committed that if 
it is done it will be because it is good for Honduras, its 
economy, and the future of its people. It will be done with the 
utmost honesty, [words indistinct], controlled, reviewed, 
supervised, so there is not the slightest doubt of a dirty deal 
behind the privatization. [passage omitted] 
  What we have to do is present a proposal and discuss it with 
the Armed forces and the other institutions. This proposal has 
three options: 1) there will be no more forced recruitment; 2) 
the Armed Forces has a proposal on the selection of members of 
this armed institution; and 3) our proposal that recruitment be 
on a volunteer- educational basis. This can be included and 
should be included in our proposal to the legislative assembly. 
  As far as Palmerola is concerned, within the context of the 
Cold War, it is a human tragedy that has lasted for almost half 
a century, from 1945 post war, to 1989, 1990, 1991, depending on 
the region where world tensions were being eliminated. There are 
people who still have the Cold War mind-set; they would like 
those tensions and ideological confrontations to return. This 
must be discussed in depth and light must be shed on the 
Palmerola issue. 
  This is the result of extending an agreement not a treaty. 
The difference between an agreement and a treaty, for those who 
are not lawyers, is that an agreement does not have to be 
submitted to Congress while a treaty needs to be submitted to 
Congress. Everything relating to military matters should be 
submitted to Congress. During that time, however, we were 
involved in a national security situation. Those were very 
difficult times for Honduras, the hemisphere, and humanity. 
There was an arms race going on that was going to become the War 
of the Galaxy. That is why we firmly opposed this because 
Honduras was going to be the scene of a world war. 
  Having overcome this, the discussion must center on whether 
international cooperation and collaboration can help us 
accomplish the points of the new agenda. What are these points? 
Human rights, ecology, drug trafficking, fighting poverty, and 
the improvement of justice. This is what we must discuss. We 
must no longer talk about who is or is not a communist, which 
was a common topic within the context of the Cold War. If this 
can be done and be discussed in-depth at Congress, the decision 
regarding such installations will come from here. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Reporter Diaz] [words indistinct] to improve the country's 
economic situation by reducing the fiscal deficit. Aside from 
the talks on the privatization of some enterprises and taking 
into account that 90 percent of the budget of different 
institutions is used to pay personnel, could your administration 
-- as other governments have promised to do many times -- reduce 
state bureaucracy? 
  [Reina] Miss Edith Diaz, Mr. Jaime Rosenthal said in his 
letter issued the day before yesterday that the problem is not 
the fiscal deficit per se, which is very appropriate. He said 
the problem is the deficit with the balance of payments, namely 
the commercial balance. He indicated that we do not export 
enough; we import more than we export, thereby incurring 
deficits. Consequently, we must produce more to be able to 
export more. I think he is saying the right thing. 
  But your question centers more on how and when the fiscal 
deficit will be cut. When we talk about Hondutel, it is 
precisely for that purpose. Petrodollars came and these 
countries got irresponsibly into debt. Now 43 percent of the 
budget goes to pay this debt, while another large percentage is 
used to pay state employees. There is no money left for the 
development of the country. How can we advance like this? Where 
did the borrowed money go to? How was it spent? How was it 
invested? 
  To reduce state bureaucracy, one must know how we received 
the country in January 1994 and take measures to cleanse the 
economy. This begins by fighting corruption. To reduce the 
government, the problem is sometimes how to compensate people 
employed by the government. For example, these people's salaries 
were increased so they would have larger benefits. I have asked 
if we must eliminate excess personnel? I was told yes, but we 
must pay so many millions in severance pay. This is a 
straitjacket for the government. What do we do? Do we break the 
law and not compensate them? Do we go further into debt to pay 
the compensations? Do we leave officials in office who do not 
have any duties? Do not go into politics because this is very 
difficult. It is not easy to resolve these problems, but we are 
going to face them. We must overcome... [pauses] because these 
situations can be overcome. A government team with good 
intentions, courage, determination, a team of the best men can 
do so. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Edgard Barberena] </F>
  [Excerpt] With 63 deputies voting, the National Assembly 
on 23 February eliminated the "second padlock" from the 
Constitution, which will make it possible before mid-year to 
approve partial amendments to the Constitution in one round of 
debates 
  The historical step was taken by the deputies of the Center 
Bloc (BC), Christian Democratic Union (UDC), Unity and 
Reconciliation (BUR), the Sandinist bloc, the legislative group 
of the Conservative Popular Alliance (APC), and the Social 
Democratic bloc comprised of representatives from the MDN 
[Nicaraguan Democratic Movement] and the PSD [Social Democratic 
Party]. 
  The second debate followed the 60-percent procedure 
established by law. Therefore, President Violeta de Chamorro is 
expected to sanction the first amendments made to the 
Constitution since its promulgation on 10 January 1987. 
<H5>  Chamorro Cannot Exercise Veto </H5>
  With regard to the constitutional amendments, President 
Chamorro has no veto authority, and if the Executive Branch does 
not veto the amendments within the 15 days stipulated by law, 
National Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman must order its 
publication in the official gazette or any other media. 
[sentence as published] 
  The only ones who walked out during the voting were some UNO 
[National Opposition Union] deputies after Adolfo Garcia 
Esquivel delivered a confusing speech that no one understood 
announcing the withdrawal of the minority group they now have in 
the National Assembly. 
<H5>  First Modifications </H5>
  The constitutional amendments approved on 23 February read 
as 
follows: 
  Article 192: "The bill on partial amendments must specify 
the titles, chapters, and articles to be amended, abrogated, or 
added and explain the reasons; it must be submitted to a special 
commission that will announce its decision within a period of 60 
days. The bill on constitutional amendments will then be subject 
to the procedures established for the creation of laws." 
  Article 195: "Amendments to constitutional laws will be made 
in accordance with procedures established for partial amendments 
to the Constitution." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Quito, 25 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Ecuadoran President Sixto 
Duran-Ballen denied today that he is going to resign, condemned 
rumors of a possible coup d'etat, and gave assurances that he 
will continue in his post until his term ends in 1996. 
  "I have not thought of resigning; I shall continue ahead. 
The people elected me for a four-year period," the Ecuadoran 
president said in a news conference in the Government Palace. 
  On Wednesday various local media gave assurances that 
Duran-Ballen would leave office and Vice President Alberto Dahik 
would be appointed to replace him. 
  Duran-Ballen said that on that day he received numerous 
calls 
at his home from reporters, officials, and friends to learn the 
truth. "The callers asked whether I had suffered a heart attack, 
if it was true that the members of the military were in the 
National Palace and that I had resigned. They all were rumors," 
the president assured. 
  The 72-year-old president had a back operation a year ago 
and 
today he said that his health is good. He denied being depressed 
and affirmed that he is in good spirits to face the problems and 
responsibilities inherent to his post. 
  Duran-Ballen, elected president in August 1992, said that 
rumors about coups and the situation of unrest that exist were 
created by "people interested in creating instability in the 
country." He did not identify any of these people. 
  Regarding the plebiscite his government wants to convoke, 
the 
president said that the plebiscite, the date, and the issues it 
will cover are still being discussed. He said it would be more 
like "consulting the people." 
  The Ecuadoran Armed Forces publicly reiterated Thursday 
their 
support for President Duran-Ballen and guaranteed the permanence 
of the democratic system and their support for constitutional 
order. 
  According to the political opposition and experts, the 
Ecuadoran president is burdened by the country's political and 
economic problems. Right now the country is practically 
ungovernable. 
  Vice President Alberto Dahik is constantly in conflict with 
the opposition, to the degree that legislators have warned that 
if Duran-Ballen were to resign, Congress would appoint a 
successor who would not be the official the Constitution 
envisages.

<F P=106> [Report by Javier Ignacio Mayorca] </F>
  [Text] The trips reportedly made to Venezuelan territory by 
alleged U.S. counterspy Aldrich Ames went unnoticed by the 
Sectorial General Directorate of Identification and Control of 
Foreigners (DIEX). 
  Sources of the DIEX, which comes under the Interior 
Ministry, 
have told EL NACIONAL the entries of the former chief of the 
CIA's counterespionage Soviet Division to the country did not 
appear in immigration records. The visits to Venezuela 
attributed by REUTERS to Ames' wife Maria del Rosario Casas 
Ames, of Colombian origin, were not recorded either. 
  It should be noted the entries and departures file has 
computer records for the last three years. Arrivals or 
departures made before 1990 must be looked up manually. 
  International wire reports have reported Ames had been 
meeting with CIA personnel since 1985 in the Venezuelan capital. 
It is therefore presumed he entered the country with false 
identification. 
  Ames has been accused of counterspying for the Soviet Union 
and later for Russia. He reportedly earned $1.5 million for his 
efforts. 
  When this report was written, DIEX officials had not 
received 
the official order to determine the migratory movement of the 
spy or his wife. 
  Editor's Note: In a NEW YORK TIMES report published 
yesterday, it is said U.S. authorities have revealed Ames met 
with his contacts during two secret trips to Santa Fe de Bogota 
(in October of 1992) and Caracas (in November of 1993). 
  U.S. authorities have found cryptographic messages in the 
middle of papers investigated which are related to Caracas, and 
they said $86,700 were deposited into Ames' accounts at the 
Dominion Bank of Virginia and The Riggs National Bank upon his 
return from the Venezuelan capital.

  [Text] On 23 February, the Teotonio Vilela Human Rights 
Committee informed the Attorney General's Office about the 
creation of a new neo-Nazi group -- "White Power" [preceding two 
words in English] -- in Florianopolis (Santa Catarina State). 
The group says it has created "shooting blacks week." 
  The group threatens to attack with bombs sites regularly 
visited by blacks. In publications known as "skinzines," the 
group reports it is settling in Florianopolis to "defend racial 
purity and preserve social order." It proposes "expelling 
blacks from Brazil." 
  Councilman Marcio de Souza (Workers Party) sent the 
committee 
a publication in which the neo-Nazis promise to blow up the 
building where his office is located. 
  The messages are signed by pen names such as "Black Killer" 
[preceding two words in English]. It is stated in them that 
people involved in the bomb explosion at the World Trade Center 
building in New York have been contacted by the group and asked 
to come to Santa Catarina to conduct similar attacks. The 
Attorney General's Office will ask Federal Police to begin 
investigating the charges.

  [Text] Lima, 26 Feb (DPA) -- Peruvian Army Chief General 
Nicolas De Bari Hermoza said today in Lima that the Armed Forces 
does not control the government and affirmed that President 
Alberto Fujimori holds the reins of the country. 
  In a brief news conference, Hermoza, who is also commander 
of 
the Armed Forces Joint Command, rejected allegations by local 
and foreign observers that Fujimori is "mortgaged" to the Armed 
Forces. 
  "Military forces have no influence on the government 
whatsoever, and any statement to the contrary is groundless," 
Hermoza said. Several publications and commentators have 
described him as the virtual "power behind the throne" in Peru. 
  Gen. Hermoza added that it is clear to the Armed Forces that 
"Fujimori is the nation's first citizen based on the people's 
democratic will," and therefore "he is the supreme chief of the 
Armed Forces to whom it owes discipline and subordination." 
  Criticism has intensified in Peru and abroad about what many 
have openly defined as "a civilian-military government" after 
Congress and the government approved a controversial law giving 
military courts authority to try a case involving a massacre 
committed by soldiers. 
  Independent politicians, opposition leaders, observers from 
various groups, and local and foreign media have said that the 
government's "secretive attitude" corroborates the presumed 
submission of civilian authorities to the military forces. 
  Fujimori has repeatedly said that it is not subordination 
but 
identification between the government and the military forces on 
everything concerning the struggle against terrorism and drug 
trafficking.

The objective of the guerrillas was to obtain money to 
strengthen their movement economically.

  [Text] La Paz, 24 Feb (EFE) -- The Bolivian Armed Forces 
today asked for clarification about alleged relations between 
traffickers and outstanding Bolivian politicians. They affirmed 
that the democratic system is guaranteed by the military 
institutions. 
  General Fernando Sanjinez, the Armed Forces commander in 
chief, today pointed out the need for a detailed investigation 
to see if trafficker Carmelo "Meco" Dominguez's charges are true. 
  The arrested trafficker leveled charges during his 
declaration to Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) and a La Paz 
judge. "Meco" Dominguez, who has Chagas disease, could not 
finish his declaration in view of his poor health condition. 
  He linked former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora and the 
leadership of his party, the Movement of the Revolutionary Left 
(MIR), to the top Bolivian drug traffickers who allegedly 
provided financial support and transportation during their 
electoral campaigns. 
  Amid ever increasing dissatisfaction of their fellow party 
members, the MIR leaders today resumed a confidential meeting to 
analyze the charges of their alleged links with drug trafficking. 
  Acting MIR President Oscar Eid was challenged by some 
factions which plan to "save the party," while other factions 
urged Paz Zamora to break his silence and isolation, "guide the 
party," and "face the situation" now that his leadership is 
under discussion. 
  Meanwhile, newspapers published new photographs of Paz 
Zamora 
and Isaac "Oso" Chavarria -- who was arrested by the FELCN in 
January during one of the largest antinarcotics operations -- as 
well as a copy of one Guillermo Capobianco's handwritten letters 
dated 13 July 1987. 
  In the letter he congratulates Chavarria on his birthday. It 
begins: "Dear Oso: I will not be able to accompany Jaime and 
Oscar at the big celebration." The letter is signed by 
Capobianco, who was then an important MIR leader in Santa Cruz. 
  Other MIR leaders said that in 1987 "no one knew Mr. 
Chavarria was linked to drug trafficking."

doors asked Congress to investigate its possible link with drug 
trafficking. 
  Confessed drug trafficker Carmelo Dominguez, aka Meco, in a 
statement to authorities of the Special Antinarcotics Force 
(FELCN), linked Paz Zamora and his closest aids with the most 
important Bolivian drug traffickers. 
  Acting MIR leader Oscar Eid said that a congressional 
commission will determine whether or not the party as an 
institution was linked to drug trafficking, and added that if 
there is evidence involving one or another of the leaders, "we 
will promote the appropriate legal proceedings." 
  Eid also asserted that "there is no reason for the former 
chief of state (Paz Zamora) to be subject to any investigation." 
  So far the Bolivian media have published about half a dozen 
photographs of Paz Zamora accompanied by former Army Captain 
Isaac Chavarria, aka Oso, who is regarded by the FELCN as one of 
the greatest alleged drug traffickers. 
  Dominguez asserted that Paz Zamora personally "closed a 
deal" 
during a meeting in 1987 with Chavarria and Jorge Roca Suarez, 
aka "Techo de Paja" [Thatched Roof] -- currently in prison in 
California, the United States, charged with drug trafficking -- 
for $500,000 in financial aid for the MIR's electoral campaign.

  [Text] The Chamber of Deputies, during its plenary session 
yesterday, accepted the Movement of the Revolutionary Left's 
[MIR] request that the lower house's Constitution Commission 
investigate this party. 
  I have said, quote, investigate this party, unquote, 
intentionally because MIR Deputy Mario Rueda Pena will now 
explain to us that the MIR is by no means, nor is it even 
suspected of being, involved with drug trafficking, but rather 
some of its leaders. 
  [Begin Rueda recording] It is not the MIR, my party -- and 
this must be made quite clear -- but some MIR leaders and 
militants, who have been mentioned by two outstanding Bolivian 
drug traffickers such as Meco Dominguez and Chavarrias, to the 
judges in charge of hearing drug cases. I think Meco Dominguez 
rather than Chavarrias made the charges. Therefore, let us not 
mistake the trees for the forest. The trees are those 
mentioned, and the forest is the institution, the party. It is 
not a matter of saying that the MIR is being investigated; I 
belong to the MIR, and nobody can say I am involved with drug 
trafficking, that I am linked to drug trafficking, or can you 
accuse me of that? Not me. Anyway, the Chamber of Deputies 
Constitutional Commission will determine who is involved. Well, 
they already have the names, the names have already been made 
public, and among them more or less 300 to 500 outstanding MIR 
leaders are not mentioned, nor are the thousands and thousands 
of militants the MIR has in its capacity as an institution. 
[end recording] 
  Mario Ruedas is right. But the MIR leaders themselves are to 
blame for the confusion. The MIR leaders yesterday held a news 
conference during which they said that the MIR rejects, the MIR 
is submitting itself, the MIR -- several things in its capacity 
as an institution, as a political party -- but they did not 
bother to identify those involved in this affair with Meco 
Dominguez and Oso Chavarrias. We are referring to an 
institution with more than 20 years of impeccable reputation.

  [Text] MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] leader 
Fernando Cajias has said that his party should give an 
explanation not only to Congress, but also to the public. 
  The first problem was that of corruption. Now 
"narcopolitics" [narcopolitica] is casting doubts over the New 
Majority faction of the MIR. 
  Party leader Fernando Cajias has said that the important 
thing in this democratic war is to defend and preserve the 
project that the party has historically endorsed. 
  [Begin Cajias recording] To this end it is essential to 
introduce changes, because we believe that [passage indistinct]. 
[end recording] 
  The new MIR proposal is that in addition to giving an 
explanation to the public, the party has to reorganize itself. 
[recorded passage indistinct] 
  Jaime Paz is reportedly untouchable. Is that true? We asked 
Cajias about it. 
  [Begin Cajias recording] I believe that, undoubtedly, as he 
is -- in metaphorical language -- the marshal of the forces, he 
has to be spared for the big battles that still lie ahead. Yet 
this does not prevent him from the obligation to give 
orientation and guidance. 
  (?I made) a proposal, but I did not say that he has to give 
an overly encompassing explanation of some problems, but he does 
have to break his silence, particularly at an internal party 
level, in order to guide party members. [end recording] 
  Cajias finally emphasized that the MIR should give an 
explanation to the country.

  [Text] Former Interior Minister Guillermo Capobianco said 
Isaac Chavarria evidently financed the Revolutionary Left 
Movement, MIR,'s political campaign. He explained that a MIR 
committee was then in charge of collecting those funds. 
  Capobianco added, however, that he did not know about 
Chavarria's illegal activities and Chavarria had introduced 
himself as a prosperous businessman. 
  Capobianco requested that Gonzalo Torrico explain whether he 
knew about Chavarria's illegal activities. The former minister 
said Chavarria contributed money to the MIR New Majority 
political campaign, but he does not know exactly when the 
contribution was made. He added that Chavarria lent his planes 
to former President Jaime Paz Zamora's campaign, during which 
the photographs that have been creating commotion were taken. 
  Capobianco explained that he does not know how much 
Chavarria 
gave the campaign. He denied, however, receiving these funds 
because they were handed to a committee of MIR members in charge 
of receiving this sort of campaign contribution. 
  Capobianco pointed out that at the time, the MIR was fully 
implementing the New Majority political program, but did not 
count on the financial help of prosperous businessmen as 
interested as we were, he said, in financially supporting them. 
He added that at that time, Chavarria introduced himself as a 
prosperous businessman dedicated to agricultural activities in 
the Chiquitana region and offered to help in the implementation 
work [words indistinct]. From then on, he said, facts are known 
to a [word indistinct] committee and that he has nothing to do 
with them.

  [Text] Cochabamba, 16 Feb (EL MUNDO) -- President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada said: "We disagree with the reduction of U.S. 
economic aid for interdiction and against drug trafficking. We 
believe we should have serious and permanent U.S. economic aid 
without disregarding national sovereignty. We should not be left 
alone with this problem. The United States now wants to 
concentrate more on the struggle against drug trafficking within 
its borders." 
  Sanchez de Lozada held a very confidential meeting in 
Cochabamba's El Carmen Hotel with a U.S. senator [Robert Graham] 
from Florida who is a member of a committee on appropriations 
and intelligence and with the U.S. ambassador. Sanchez said: 
"The meeting was very important to let them know we believe it 
is just and necessary to have the continuation of aid but 
without violating national sovereignty. The struggle against 
drug trafficking is a Bolivian priority; it is not imposed but 
we need support for its success." 
  Sanchez emphasized: The policy and appropriation of funds to 
fight drug trafficking depend a great deal on the U.S. 
committee. For Bolivia this is very important; there is a trend 
to cut resources for the developing countries. The U.S. 
Government also has problems with the budget deficit. 
  Sanchez, who denied reports that the U.S. officials gave 
some 
kind of ultimatum for the total eradication of coca within the 
framework of the "Zero Option" project, said this issue was not 
discussed. 
  Sanchez added: "There is nothing concrete on the `Zero 
Option' project. What we are after is a new project that would 
not leave us with the traditional mechanism of repression, 
eradication, and substitution. The `Zero Option' is still 
unknown. We are seeking a final solution, not a traumatic 
solution, to get out of this situation because that would not be 
good for anyone, for either the country, the peasants, or the 
world." 
  Sanchez also said he conveyed to the U.S. ambassador and the 
senator the firm Bolivian commitment, as a country and a 
society, to struggle against drug trafficking, and "to try to 
get out of the drug business" that is destroying youths and 
becoming very dangerous because when it is combined with armed 
groups or cartels it will create violence. 
  Sanchez indicated that this is an economic and social 
problem; it is not only a problem of repression because jobs 
also should be offered to the coca growers -- "this is why we 
are trying to carry out projects such as the Capitalization and 
Popular Participation projects. Jobs must be created in the 
coca areas and the entire country to prevent coca growing from 
being a good business because the price of coca varies according 
to the level of repression." 
  Regarding the charges made by coca growers that members of 
Direco [Coca Reduction Directorate] and Dinaco [National Coca 
Control Directorate] were eradicating coca by force on 14 
February, President Sanchez said there is no forced coca 
eradication in the country. "It is not included in the 
legislation and, according to Law No. 1008 of Coca and 
Controlled Substances, only after payments are made is it 
mandatory to eradicate the coca plantations; all the other 
eradications are still voluntary." 
  Meanwhile, coca growers have declared themselves in a state 
of emergency, suspended coca substitution, and announced a large 
meeting for today in Villa Tunari to protest the lack of 
government answers to their demands for alternative development 
and the depenalization of coca, and for the defense of coca, 
which they are sure will be eradicated by force to fulfill the 
eradication quota of 6,500 hectares by 31 March because not even 
50 percent of that quota has been fulfilled. 
  President Sanchez said: "The eradication is voluntary in 
Bolivia. The coca growers are like COB [Bolivian Labor 
Federation] members; they talk without knowing or give 
information for their benefit or distort it. But I am not 
offended; it is part of democracy."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The New U.S. Antidrug Strategy"] </F>
  [Text] The speech in which President Bill Clinton announced 
his new antidrug program will surely go down in history as one 
of the most outstanding and dramatic testimonies of the damage 
that drugs have produced within U.S. society. It is not by 
chance that he has decreed a full mobilization of the government 
and of citizens. 
  To learn that in the United States drug addiction is growing 
despite the efforts that have been made, that it has invaded 
schools and workplaces, that it has made the streets of small 
and big cities dangerous, and that many sick people who report 
to hospitals cannot be admitted because "emergency rooms are 
full of people who have been stabbed or shot," is a way of 
becoming familiar with a distant yet formidable tragedy. 
  Those who want to imitate consumerism could hardly believe 
Mr. Clinton when he said that people are afraid of going onto 
the streets because of the violence prevailing there, and that 
the new law against crime states that the streets will be 
patrolled by an additional 100,000 policemen. This shows that 
the drug issue in the United States is really serious. 
  Consequently, we should not be surprised that part of the 
new 
effort -- which will have repercussions in our country -- will 
include restrictions on the offer of drugs. The U.S. President 
has proposed that rather than "hunting" traffickers as they 
enter the United States, it is better "to stir up the hornet's 
nest." This means that the struggle in the countries that 
produce raw materials or drugs will be much harsher. 
  Clinton said this will be "part of the U.S. foreign policy 
in 
the main countries where drugs originate or which are used for 
transit." This is nothing new for us: Since the 1970's, the U.S. 
policy in Bolivia and other Andean nations has centered around 
drugs. Yet this time it has been made clear that the strategy 
will not seek to merely intercept shipments, it will seek to 
destroy the cartels that produce and sell drugs "using better 
technology and more ingenious methods." Besides, the United 
States now expects these countries to show their "full political 
will to persecute the drug-trafficking bosses." 
  Clinton has asked the U.S. Congress to increase by $76 
million -- to a total of $427 million -- funding for this 
activity in 1995, without specifying the use of the funds. In 
the case of Bolivia, we know how important alternative 
development programs are for giving Chapare peasants other 
sources of income. 
  Even though militarization -- which was so dear to the Bush 
administration -- has been finally eliminated from the bilateral 
agenda, police interdiction work, with DEA help, has increased 
without the activities of that agency having been regulated. 
  The Bolivian Government should obviously support the all-out 
struggle that the United States and the international community 
are waging against the fearsome world of drugs. Provisions are 
necessary, however, to wage this fight within the framework of 
institutional democracy, preventing the justifiable U.S. zeal 
from affecting Bolivian sovereignty and initiative.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Drug-Trafficking Problem: Unfavorable Winds </F>
Blow From Washington"] 
  [Text] The U.S. antidrug policy seems to have taken an 
unexpected and dramatic turn. First President Clinton himself, 
and later on the main U.S. Government authorities responsible 
for this area, announced to the world that the new 
administration had decided to lay emphasis on the prevention of 
drug consumption, and reduce repression activities. 
  This announcement made sense taking into account the 
lamentable and universal failure of the repression activities 
carried out by the Army and police of that superpower, as well 
as of those carried out by the cocaine producing countries. The 
millions invested during the last years of the U.S. Republican 
administration were wasted, because repression by itself only 
pushes drug prices up, and this in turn gives the drug 
traffickers more power, thus generating more production and 
involving new people in this illegal trade. Another irrefutable 
argument was that U.S. taxpayers were sick of seeing their money 
ill spent on repression actions within their country and abroad, 
instead of being used for more profitable purposes. 
  Bolivia received this news with a sense of relief and hope. 
The escalation in repression activities was not solving the 
problem at all; on the contrary it was creating the appropriate 
conditions for a fearful and dangerous wave of violence which -- 
like what is happening in Colombia -- could lead to bloodshed in 
the country, cause victims having nothing to do with drug 
trafficking, place the democratic process at stake, increase 
political and personal rivalries, and bring more hunger and 
unemployment to the conflictive rural areas engaged in producing 
coca leaves. 
  Recent reports from Washington point in a different 
direction, however, and one not so encouraging for Bolivia, as 
the plan to emphasize prevention rather than repression only 
applies to the United States, as the armed struggle against drug 
trafficking in Bolivia will be even greater. As a correspondent 
of the international media pointed out when the announcement was 
made on 9 February, the change furnished by Clinton's plan 
forecasts days of peace for the United States but of war for 
Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Mexico. 
  One could say that the increasing militarization of the 
struggle against drug trafficking is a positive fact, because it 
is a chance for the Armed Forces and police to receive more 
funds, thus relieving the National Treasury. This, however, is 
a cynical and highly dangerous conclusion for the country, which 
has nevertheless been handling this area in a very unscrupulous 
manner, through successive administrations. It is quite obvious 
that between intensifying a stupid war in the country, and 
having a poor Army and police, the latter is the much better 
choice. 
  If the government does not reject this alarming prospect, 
one 
could believe that this new policy is not only welcomed in 
Bolivia, but also that it was promoted by our government. One 
must not forget that behind this policy in the United States 
there are people of great influence in the State Department who 
support its implementation. 
  The official U.S. announcement states that $13 billion will 
be earmarked for the treatment and prevention of drug abuse in 
the United States, while $427 million will be invested to 
"eradicate" cocaine and heroin, the latter in the "golden 
triangle" formed by Laos, Burma, and Thailand. 
  It should also be recalled that these definitions of policy 
are part of a much broader concept which the Clinton 
administration calls "global affairs," [preceding two word in 
English] that is, a strategic concept focused on the U.S. 
national interests in its new role -- which is now generally 
acknowledged -- as international policeman. 
  Thus, the so-called struggle against drug trafficking is 
also 
designed to maintain satellite armies and their own forces 
trained in combat on foreign terrain. This was the cause of the 
recent and bitter controversy in Colombia, generated by the 
small and highly specialized units of the U.S. Army which enter 
into whatever country in the capacity of "engineers" or 
"physicians" engaged in civilian projects. The truth is -- and 
this is quite obvious -- that they carry out maneuvers using the 
"rapid deployment tactics" with which we became familiar two 
years ago. 
  Bolivians have the duty to be on the alert, and support our 
government if it dares to raise before international 
organizations the expediency of depenalizing drug production and 
consumption that are at this point banned. A sound argument 
would be that if we continue on this same path, Bolivia will be 
threatened by instability and violence, which is in no way 
suitable for South America's international system. People would 
listen to us if we had the courage to make the proposal. But in 
order to be able to do so we need to give up the comfortable 
situation of our Armed Forces living on the repression of drug 
trafficking.

<F P=106> [Report by Ramon Melenciano] </F>
  [Text] Santo Domingo, 28 Feb (EFE) -- A report from the 
Haitian Commission for Justice and Peace, which says that the 
Dominican Government is violating the UN embargo against the 
Haitian coupist military leaders, is a false accusation, 
Dominican Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral told EFE 
on 28 February. 
  Herrera Cabral said that the Dominican Republic is complying 
with the UN sanctions and only sends "humanitarian aid" to 
Haiti. He added that the accusation has been made at a time 
when Haitian Catholic bishops are trying to obtain UN permission 
to transport fuel from Dominican territory to face the critical 
situation in Haiti. 
  The Haitian Commission for Justice and Peace published a 
report in Port-au-Prince today saying Dominican and Haitian 
soldiers are involved in fuel trafficking to Haiti, which is 
facing a blockade since the ousting of Constitutional President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 1991. 
  Herrera Cabral said the report is false and contradicts a 
request from Haitian bishops and civilian assistance 
organizations demanding permission for the entrance of more 
products to reduce the misery in Haiti, which has increased with 
the embargo. Herrera Cabral deplored that the "commission" 
should dedicate its efforts to supervising the border between 
the two countries to verify if the Dominican Government is 
complying or not with the embargo. 
  He added that the commission should dedicate its efforts to 
plans that will make it possible to improve the calamitous 
situation afflicting the poor people of Haiti, who are living in 
misery. "They are wasting their time, because we (the Dominican 
Government) are complying with the sanctions and they should 
dedicate their time to fight poverty," Herrera Cabral told EFE. 
  Herrera Cabral, however, did not rule out the possibility 
that "some gallons of fuel" could cross the border, but not with 
the government's permission. Herrera Cabral reminded the 
Haitian Commission for Justice and Peace that last week the 
Dominican Armed Forces Ministry punished an officer involved in 
fuel trafficking to Haiti and that vigilance at the border is 
constant and strict. He reiterated that he does not understand 
the reason for the "false reports at a time when Catholic 
bishops are requesting aid." 
  Today, the Dominican Foreign Ministry announced that the UN 
Security Council and the UN Sanctions Committee authorized the 
country to send food, propane gas, agricultural products, and 
other staples to the Haitian people, within the concept of 
"humanitarian aid" permitted by that international organization. 
In announcing the UN authorization, Herrera Cabral explained 
that the Dominican Republic will continue implementing the 
embargo that seeks the return of democracy to Haiti. 
  In its protest, the Haitian commission also accused the 
United Nations of permitting the violations and not supervising 
the Dominican Republic's compliance with the sanctions. 
  Herrera Cabral said that the United Nations are aware that 
the Dominican Republic is complying with the embargo, and 
rejected a recommendation that the international organization 
should control the Dominican-Haitian border.

<F P=106> [Report by Herold Jean-Francois] </F>
  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 28 Feb (EFE) -- The Justice and 
Peace Commission of Haiti, assigned to the Catholic Church in 
Gonaives Municipality, accused the Dominican Republic of 
violating the oil embargo decreed by the UN Security Council. In 
a report published in the Haitian capital today, the commission 
assigned to the diocese of Gonaives said Dominican and Haitian 
soldiers cooperate in transporting gasoline across the border 
that divides both countries. 
  On 24 February, an investigative committee of the Justice 
and 
Peace Commission saw movement of fuel contraband at the 
northeast border, at the Haitian city of Quanaminthe, near the 
Dominican city of Dajabon. A large number of uniformed Dominican 
soldiers were seen participating in the operation, the religious 
organization reported. 
  The commission said the soldiers, in front of the civilians, 
direct the transfer of an impressive motorcade of freight and 
personnel, who transport the fuel down the local river. 
According to the organization, nearly 250 carts, each one 
carrying three barrels of gasoline, are transported each day in 
15 trips across the border. 
  The organization added that the Haitian military takes 
charge 
of the fuel once it enters Haitian territory. The Justice and 
Peace Commission said an area has been set up near the border to 
store the fuel. 
  The commission regrets that the UN Security Council has not 
denounced this situation. "The United Nations has not adopted 
any measures to supervise and enforce the oil embargo at the 
Dominican-Haitian border, which, as a consequence, is prolonging 
the crisis and at the same time strengthening the coupists' 
economic and political power," the commission said. The United 
Nations, after the 1993 efforts to restore Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide to power as the constitutional president of Haiti 
failed, decreed an oil embargo against Haiti. 
  Meanwhile, today, the U.S. Coast Guard repatriated 141 
Haitian refugees, who tried to abandon the country in a boat, 
which was located near the Windward Passage between Cuba and 
Haiti. Since 1 January, U.S. Coast Guard ships have repatriated 
302 Haitian refugees.

<F P=106> [Report by Edwige Balutansky] </F>
  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 28 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The U.S. 
Government, which is disgruntled with deposed Haitian President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, may let an oil tanker pass through the 
blockade in the next few days, sources close to the coupist 
military offices said today. "It would not be surprising. The 
U.S. has clearly shown it does not intend to exert further 
pressure on the military. It has never sought to corner them," 
the official told an international news agency. 
  The UN Security Council decided to apply an oil and arms 
embargo against Haiti last October in order to force the 
military officers who toppled Aristide with a coup d'etat in 
1991 to return to the democratic system. 
  "Pressure exerted on the Dominican Republic reportedly 
worsened the effects of the embargo; instead, they are seeking 
that Aristide share power with the coupists and decree an 
amnesty for the offenses perpetrated these last 28 months," the 
source noted. The lack of controls on the Dominican border 
allows entry into the country of sufficient oil so that traffic 
is nearly normal. 
  After conducting a study of the northern part of the border 
between both nations, the Justice and Peace Human Rights 
Commission of the Catholic Church reported that more than 66,000 
gallons of gasoline are brought daily into Haiti with the 
complicity of Dominican soldiers. In Haiti, this "illegal" 
traffic is totally controlled by the military, who obtain 
revenues of 20,625 gourdes, some $7,392, for each truck 
transporting hydrocarbons. The Justice and Peace Commission 
regretted that these open violations are not sanctioned by the 
United Nations. 
  Meanwhile, parliamentarians opposed to the return of 
Aristide 
to this Caribbean island denied Monday that they want to install 
a new government. They termed this information on the issue as 
"rumors." Senator Bernard Sansaricq, spokesman for this group, 
declared last week that "all the institutions are ready to 
support the Parliament's initiative to install a new junta, only 
pending the persons who will form it. The Army cannot play that 
card; it has not received the green light from the United 
States," a source close to the military commented. 
  The group of anti-Aristide lawmakers, who staged "a coup 
d'etat" against the Senate's Board of Directors, announced last 
week the visit of Army Chief General Raoul Cedras to the 
Parliament to take the opportunity to present the new 
government. Despite having waited in vain for Cedras, who 
according to sources close to the Parliament supported this 
initiative in the beginning, Sansaricq would insist on Monday 
that a new administration be named. 
  Meanwhile, the U.S. Coast Guard today repatriated 141 
Haitian 
-- boat people [preceding two words in English] -- who tried to 
reach Florida, United States, in boats. Officials of the local 
Red Cross announced that 40 more Haitians will be repatriated 
tomorrow.

  [Text] Senator Bernard Sansaricq, president of the other 
Senate office, thinks the resolution of the Haitian crisis must 
inevitably go through the formation of a temporary government 
within the scope of Article 111 of the Constitution of March 
1987. Sansaricq asserts that it will be necessary, sooner or 
later, to end up with Article 148 or Article 149. 
  [Begin Sansaricq recording] "We are working on the solution 
so we can establish a government that will operate under Article 
111 of the Constitution." Let me explain what I mean: "We cannot 
go straight to Article 148 of the Constitution" because, 
(?although) there has been a resigning prime minister for two 
and a half months, President Aristide has not deemed it 
necessary to appoint a new prime minister. 
  "This is a problem. We cannot implement Article 148 because 
the prime minister should be appointed by President Aristide. We 
cannot implement Article 149 precisely because the parliament 
restored Mr. Aristide as president of the Republic on 16 June 
1993. So, this makes it impossible for us to implement Article 
149." 
  We must nevertheless [changes thought] As the situation must 
be untangled, we must have a temporary government until we can 
settle on the implementation of either Article 148 or Article 
149 of the Constitution. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] In Port-au-Prince we are moving toward the 
possible formation of an ad hoc government. According to Senator 
Bernard Sansaricq, the conditions have been met for the 
establishment of such a government. Sen. Sensaricq, in a Radio 
Metropole interview, cited Article 111 of the Constitution to 
put an end to the vacuum created by the resignation of the 
Robert Malval government. According to Bernard Sansaricq, all 
institutions agree on the necessity of forming an ad hoc 
government. He nevertheless spoke of divergences on the choice 
of personalities to comprise this government. 
  [Begin recording] [Sansaricq] "The country has been at the 
point of death for two and a half months, even longer than that. 
But for two months, specifically, there has been no management 
from the executive. So far, President Aristide has refused to 
appoint a new prime minister. The Senate of the Republic 
especially.... [changes thought] We cannot wait around for the 
president to perhaps have a dream one night, then say the next 
morning: Well, I am going to appoint a prime minister in Haiti. 
No, there must be.... [changes thought] We are joint holders of 
the national sovereignty. We must do something and we are going 
to do something in compliance with Article 111 of the 
Constitution, which reads as follows: The legislative power 
makes laws on all subjects of public interest. 
  "One does not have the right to hinder a nation as this one 
has been hindered. One does not have the right.... President 
Aristide should really understand that after the resignation of 
the prime minister, he was duty-bound to immediately appoint 
another prime minister and to submit his name to parliament for 
ratification. He did not do it. 
  ``One can see there is an omnilevel entanglement. [passage 
omitted] Things must be taken in hand. This is why the Senate of 
the Republic, the new office of the Senate of the Republic, has 
taken the matter in hand. We declared as early as 21 February 
that we would sit, permanently. We wish to force the 
institutions to follow us and together, to form a government of 
public safety that will be a very provisional ad hoc government 
until we can decide whether we are going to implement Art. 148 
or Art. 149. But we cannot let this country drift, we cannot let 
the people die [corrects himself] we cannot let the country 
continue to die, as has been the case. [passage omitted] 
  ``I think we are going to find the support necessary to 
accomplish the formation of an ad hoc temporary government. I 
again use the word, `temporary,' until we can decide to 
implement Art. 148 or 149 of the Constitution. [passage omitted] 
I believe there are lucid forces in this country. The Committee 
of Action for National Reconciliation is one of these forces 
that gathered 48 organizations together to support these ideas. 
They also agree with the establishment of an ad hoc government. 
I believe this global idea is more or less accepted by all 
institutions in Haiti.'' 
  [Reporter Clarens Renois] "Did you discuss this idea with 
the 
Army, with General Cedras?" 
  [Sansaricq] "Personally, I did not. But I know others who 
did 
discuss it with the Army." 
  [Renois] "Would the Army today agree to support an ad hoc 
government?" [Sansaricq] "I think the Army is very aware that 
the situation is very serious and that we must end up in the 
formation of a new government. I cannot speak on behalf of the 
Haitian Army and I do not want to speak on behalf of the Haitian 
Army. I want to speak on behalf of the Senate of the Republic. 
Of course, we are in consultation and we will remain in 
consultation with the Armed Forces and all public forces in this 
country. I must tell you that everybody agrees that we must 
reach something." [end recording] [passage omitted]

conscientious and nationalistic parliamentarians to choose one 
of these three resolutions that can (?contribute) to the welfare 
of the Haitian people. We in the OCL ask that the Haitian Army 
-- in the event that the parliament cannot do its job of 
choosing one of the three resolutions -- go into action and form 
a military junta. That military junta should (?direct) the 
National Palace so it can manage the Haitian crisis and lead the 
country properly until elections are held. [end recording]

  [Text] In a statement dated 24 February, Senator 
Jean-Jacques Clark Parent has written: Since 30 September 1991, 
an abnormal situation has been developing in the country. 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, head of state legally elected during the 
16 December 1990 elections, is not in Haiti. He is in 
Washington, the capital of another sovereign country. Yet, until 
now, he is acknowledged as president of the Republic of Haiti by 
all national and international authorities including the 
parliament, the Haitian Army, the churches, the private sector, 
the United Nations, the OAS, and so forth, says Sen. Parent. 
  The question he has put to the Haitian Army, the parliament, 
the United Nations, the OAS, and the powers called Friends of 
Haiti is: Why is Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the president of the 
Republic, not in Haiti today? Is he imprisoned in Washington as 
Toussaint Louverture was in Fort Joux [located in the Jura 
Mountains in France where Haitian General Toussaint Louverture 
died on 7 April 1803 after he had attempted to free Haiti from 
the French]? Only the United States can answer this question 
through the words of its President, Bill Clinton. At any rate, 
so far, the president of the Republic, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, 
is not at the National Palace of Port-au-Prince, he adds. 
  As for me, I say no, because this is an affront to all 
Haitians no matter whether they are rich or poor, black or 
mulatto, military or civilian. Is that what the so-called 
civilized people call the new world order? If so, is logic no 
longer the universal way to reason soundly, because I have a 
contrary opinion. Sen. Jean-Jacques Clark Parent further says: I 
therefore urge General Cedras to resign, as agreed in the 
Governors Island agreement; and I suggest that the Haitian Army, 
the institution intended to guarantee the safety of lives and 
property in the country, form within the next 72 hours a 
high-ranking civilian-military delegation charged with going to 
Washington in order to look for the president of the Republic, 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and bring him [back] to the National 
Palace of Port-au-Prince so he can carry out his duties as 
president of the Republic under the security of the Haitian 
Armed Forces until his mandate expires so as to put an end to 
this unbearable situation gnawing at our country and it will be 
justice, concludes the statement of Jean-Jacques Clark Parent, 
senator of the Republic. 
  Parent has sent this statement to Jean-Bertrand Aristide, 
Bill Clinton, the OAS, the United Nations, the governments of 
Haiti's four friendly countries, the U.S. Congress, the 
parliamentarians of the 45th legislature, the Army, all 
ambassadors accredited to Haiti, Pope John Paul II, the Haitian 
Episcopal Conference, the Association of Haitian Protestants, 
the members of the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industries, 
the members of the judiciary, and the press.

F-16 fighters today near Banja Luka in northwestern Bosnia, in 
keeping with a UN Security Council resolution that forbids any 
and all flights in the skies over Bosnia, according to a NATO 
military spokesman. 
  This is the first time NATO planes have opened fire in 
Bosnia, after the Serb planes ignored the F-16s' orders to land. 
NATO planes have been patrolling Bosnia daily since April 1993, 
with a view to enforcing respect of UN Security Council 
Resolution No. 816, which forbids any and all flights in Bosnian 
airspace, according to the spokesman. 
  Meanwhile, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees [word indistinct] said all humanitarian flights to 
Sarajevo have been suspended, as has all movement toward areas 
controlled by the Serbs.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Filiberto Rondon by journalist </F>
Estela Guerra; place and date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Guerra] Everyone knows about the work the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] is doing to guarantee people 
better living conditions, bearing in mind that this is the 
fundamental factor that guarantees the success of the different 
missions entrusted to the various armies. In order to get more 
details about the work being done in the FAR in that connection, 
I am talking to Colonel Filiberto Rondon, second in command of 
the Western Army Rear Services. 
  Colonel, I have had the opportunity to tour this great 
Western Army unit. I have noticed that many of the things done 
here are things that lie within the realm of many centers, of 
many state organizations. Why...[pauses] what is the basic 
reason that these solutions are sought here, and that effective 
solutions to the needs of the population -- the soldiers and the 
population in general -- are found here? 
  [Rondon] We have instructions from our minister, who is the 
head of the Army, to seek solutions; and we have been told that 
we must guarantee, with fewer resources, the sacred duty of 
defending the fatherland. Therefore, we are obliged to seek 
solutions. We draw our inspiration from the thoughts of Jose 
Marti, who said that if there are capable men, there are no 
difficult times; and that difficult conditions and situations 
must be given practical solutions. 
  That is why, given this situation, without abandoning its 
main tasks -- such as being combat-ready and willing to repel 
aggressions, preparing the theater of military operations, and 
preparing our troops ideologically -- our Armed Forces 
also...[pauses] the self-sufficiency plans too are a main part 
of our tasks. As I said earlier, in order to improve the living 
conditions of our troops independently of the resource 
limitations, we have been obliged to seek solutions that will 
allow our troops to be in both mental and physical shape to 
carry out their missions. And we feel that -- and you have seen 
it in this tour -- the results are there. They are not just 
words. We have already obtained results. We can speak of results 
obtained in 1993, 1992, and 1991. We have been trying to keep 
our Armed Forces from being a burden on our working population, 
and trying to lighten that burden progressively. 
  Unlike other organizations, we ourselves cannot shut down a 
unit. We cannot send soldiers home. We are obliged to seek 
solutions. And I think that that has really forced us. Moreover, 
above all, we have drawn inspiration from our Armed Forces 
minister, who demands that we maintain, despite resource 
limitations, a high level of combat readiness and a high degree 
of capability to respond to any enemy aggression. 
  [Guerra] That was Colonel Filiberto Rondon, second in 
command 
of the Western Army Rear Services, who has discussed the work 
the FAR is doing to improve the living and working conditions of 
the workers and the Armed Forces' civilian workers.

  [Text] Havana, 25 Feb (DPA) -- Today, Cuban authorities 
admitted that given the critical situation the island is 
enduring, private work has increased. Authorities confirmed that 
right now 141,000 persons are self-employed. Granma, the 
official newspaper, has said "this is not a new situation." The 
newspaper affirms that it has been necessary to assign certain 
tasks to private individuals in every age. 
  According to GRANMA, under normal economic conditions, this 
type of work does not have to be associated with the acquisition 
of wealth or negative things, like deviating resources or 
involvement with the black market as occurs now. A new law 
approved in September 1993 authorized independent work and 
expanded the number of jobs Cubans can perform independently 
under the supervision of the state and after paying a fee to 
almost 150. 
  According to a government source consulted by DPA, Cuban 
authorities are working on a document which will regulate 
violations of the Independent Work Law. It will upgrade official 
controls and in this way violations or alterations of the law 
will be avoided. 
  Since the law was approved, many vendors of artisan products 
and food have emerged, especially around businesses with 
services that are paid for in dollars. The most amazing 
services, such as bicycle parking lots, are being offered. 
Restaurants, coffee shops, and discotheques, whose services are 
invariably paid for in dollars, have also opened. 
  A clandestine restaurant of the type popularly known as 
"Paladares", which had been functioning in the Havana 
neighborhood of Vedado for months was closed recently by the 
police. They raided the site and detained the owner for a few 
hours. This is reportedly the first public case of a clandestine 
restaurant being closed by authorities after a state radio 
station warned that these establishments would be closed as of 
January.

  [Text] Adolfo Diaz, vice president of the Council of 
Ministers, said that the productive results achieved by the 
cigarette industry is leading it toward stabilization since the 
factories are close to reaching the expected levels for 1994, 
aimed at satisfying the national demand for the product. In an 
extensive communique printed in the TRABAJADORES newspaper, Diaz 
referred to the increased number of smokers among the Cuban 
population and stressed that the stable production and sale of 
cigarettes not only satisfies the consumers' needs, but 
represents a considerable contribution to the national economy, 
which is suffering the consequences of excess currency. Adolfo 
Diaz was hesitant to predict when the sale of cigarettes would 
be released, considering the many factors that would make such a 
prediction inaccurate.

  [Text] The Havana Prosecutor's Office has asked that 
Marcelo Garcia Ruvalcaba be sentenced to 15 years in prison for 
terrorism. He is a Mexican citizen who resides in the United 
States. During the trial held today in Havana City, Garcia 
Ruvalcaba admitted smuggling tear gas grenades and equipment to 
print counterrevolutionary literature into the country at the 
request of individuals linked to the paramilitary group Alpha 
66. The defendant has lived in the United States for 24 years 
and worked as a Continental Airlines supervisor at the 
California airport. The Mexican citizen established a 
relationship with Cuban photographer Jose Miranda Acosta, 45, 
and together they tried to place explosives on airplanes parked 
in Havana's Jose Marti International Airport. The Prosecutor's 
Office also requested a 15-year prison term for Miranda Acosta.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Francisco Rubio; from the "Good </F>
Morning From Mexico" newscast] 
  [Text] The bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, Samuel 
Ruiz Garcia, has announced that the draft documents that will be 
entitled Commitments for an Honorable Peace, Commitment for 
Peace, and Peace Declaration, are in their final phase. 
  He denied that national issues such as democracy and 
modification of constitutional Article 27, which deals with 
agrarian laws, have delayed the negotiations for peace. 
  [Begin Ruiz recording] There are 34 commitments. Two of 
these commitments are not binding. They have to do with 
democracy. From the beginning it was a known fact that they do 
not form part of an agreement, strictly speaking, but that they 
are an opinion made known to the national community. It is 
expected that this opinion should have an impact on this 
community. [end recording] 
  Ruiz said that some 10 or 12 points are yet to be negotiated 
before an agreement is reached. Of these points, four or five 
are of secondary importance. 
  [Begin Ruiz recording] The others have a certain level of 
importance but because of linguistic difficulties they are still 
being discussed. They are not fundamental for reaching an 
agreement. We could say that a significant agreement has been 
reached already. [end recording] 
  More than 72 hours after the doors of the peace cathedral 
were closed -- something that spawned speculation that the peace 
talks had been blocked -- Bishop Samuel Ruiz said that neither 
the commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas nor the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army have been intransigent. 
  [Begin Ruiz recording] So far there has been intransigence 
neither in the discussions of the agreements that are to be 
approved nor in the position of either side. [end recording] 
  This information was provided during a news conference that 
Bishop Samuel Ruiz held alone with reporters. He explained that 
the final text of the agreements could me made known either 
Tuesday [1 March] evening or Wednesday [2 March] morning.

<F P=106> ["Stenographic version" of statement by Bishop Samuel Ruiz </F>
Garcia to unidentified domestic and foreign reporters at the San 
Cristobal de las Casas Cathedral on 27 February] 
  [Text] Good evening to all the domestic and international 
sisters and brothers of the press, radio, and television media. 
Events that occur outside the discussion table influence 
differently those who are sitting at this table and on those who 
are abroad. Although we cannot say news has been lacking, it has 
certainly influenced the mood of the talks. For example, the 
news on what has been happening in Altamirano has influenced our 
work. Even if those events would not have occurred and we would 
not have known of the steps taken to achieve greater peace, it 
would have been difficult for the parties at the table to 
continue to progress without feeling there was a disturbing 
external pressure. 
  Fortunately, after steps were taken, good sense prevailed. 
Although several incidents occurred again, they did not 
seriously affect our work, much less the sincerity with which we 
are all acting. The incidents did not hinder us from making 
progress on topics of greater complexity, which, as we admitted 
in the joint communique issued by the mediator, the EZLN 
[Zapatist National Liberation Army], and the [peace] 
commissioner yesterday, present certain difficulties. 
  The current difficulties are not, as could be thought, -- 
characteristically I have always spoken very truthfully -- the 
contents of the agreements being discussed for later approval or 
the lack of flexibility on one side or another -- such an 
attitude has not existed up to now -- but in the inherent 
complexity of the linguistic and cultural translation. That is, 
the complicated task of reading the text of the proposals and 
understanding the terms used in the wording of a text. The 
mediator has to say that he too has had difficulty in this 
respect because there are terms in our language that vary in 
meaning according to the level or field in which they are being 
used. A word used in computer science has an entirely different 
meaning in regular usage. 
  Terms can be difficult, especially those that are abstract 
or 
have legal implications, which we do not use regularly, but 
which those who are advising us, at our request, do use 
regularly. To understand the terms and implications of a 
proposal, to make an accurate translation and find the 
corresponding words in the cultural field, and to assimilate all 
this to explain it to each linguistic group -- they have to go 
through exactly the same steps to be able to assimilate them and 
later take them to the groups in the four linguistic regions -- 
has prompted a complicated situation that computer techniques 
have not been able to alleviate. 
  We can say, however -- we would have wanted to say it in a 
more impressive manner and with everyone present for your 
satisfaction -- that we are currently in the definitive 
consensus phase. We have discussed almost all of the document, 
which I will witness the day this ends. We always say it will be 
soon but there are the differences between the pace of western 
time and the Mayan culture, which is much slower. 
  We could provide abundant examples of the complexity of this 
job, but instead of saying what I have already said, citing 
examples, perhaps we could preview the structure of the 
agreements themselves, practically all of which have already 
been discussed. Some 10 or 12 points remain to be discussed; 
some of them, four or five, are of secondary importance. Others 
have a certain relevance but there are language problems to be 
resolved. These points are being discussed but they are not 
fundamental in the agreement. We could say a significant 
agreement has been reached. 
  The document will have the following points or subheadings: 
a 
preliminary set of articles or statements, which will be called 
Commitments for a Worthy Peace in Chiapas. There are 34 
commitments. Two of these commitments do not include resolutions 
and have to do with democracy. It was difficult, since we knew 
from the beginning the commitments were not part of an 
agreement, strictly speaking, but they are opinions divulged to 
the national community and we certainly hope they will have an 
impact on the agreements. 
  The drafting of these two agreements, which are statements 
and do not include resolutions, is already finished. The 
agreements containing resolutions have to do with the different 
problems or demands made by the EZLN, to which an overall 
response has been given since the first day and to which 
solutions will be found gradually, step by step. 
  A few days ago, Subcommander Marcos and the commissioner 
said 
what percentage of the agreement points had been discussed. Once 
these commitments are made, naturally, we will reach the peace 
agreements. These agreements are made up of two parts: Mexican 
Government agreements and EZLN agreements, and include the 
military's role in this peace process, the amnesty that must be 
sought, the specific manner in which it must be implemented, and 
a final commitment to comply with the peace agreement. These two 
steps, commitments for a worthy peace, and peace agreements lead 
us to a third and final point, which is a peace declaration. 
  This peace declaration, already formulated and agreed to in 
its basic terms by mutual consent, together with all the sets of 
previous documents and agreements, as well as said commitments, 
will be presented here when the logistical part is completed, 
and each copy of that set of agreements that is picked up will 
be authenticated by me. 
  The necessary copies will be delivered to each party -- EZLN 
19 copies -- and the team of the peace commissioner and myself 
(will be delivered) as many copies as necessary, authenticated, 
that is signed by me as was the text of the original agreed 
upon. Both parties will present the accords to the rank and 
file or grass-roots structures and corresponding levels so that, 
after the established time, which evidently will not be long, 
they will return to this city to make peace in what we hope will 
be a solemn and to some degree magnificent manner, because the 
signing of these accords pertains to the entire country. 
  What the parties will do is to explain to their 
corresponding 
membership the implications and reasons why specific or concrete 
points were accepted. 
  For the peace commissioner, there is one difficulty that 
involves convincing each agency that they are part of the 
execution of the accords, and for the EZLN it involves 
distributing the document to 19 different groups, communities, 
in the language of each group. 
  Yesterday, for instance, both sides worked nearly 
unrelentingly. The EZLN representatives did not get much sleep; 
they went to bed at 0300 and had to be up and working by 0700. 
  The peace commissioner and also the mediator, with their 
respective teams, were also working on the preparation of the 
three agreed fundamental ideas. They are in the process of 
drafting the final document to make the definitive assimilation 
[asimilacion definitiva] already agreed upon, with the exception 
of eight points which, as I said, are the ones that have not 
been definitively addressed. This will permit them to later get 
to the final part. 
  It is a matter of explaining what the parties here have 
agreed to in this lengthy process of drafting documents and 
receiving the definitive support of all EZLN sectors, after the 
final signing. 
  That is the process we wished to describe to you. 
  Tomorrow, as opposed to what one might expect, given that 
today is Sunday, will be a day in which there will not be a news 
conference. All the infrastructure and logistics will be 
devoted to producing a document pertaining to issues already 
approved, and from that moment on, perhaps some of the things 
that must be considered a regulation of different 
infrastructures or commissions that have appeared as necessary 
and that have to be implemented. 
  This is what we intended to convey to you, regretting that 
the pace of work has not allowed the peace commissioner or EZLN 
representatives to be present here today. 
  Consequently, as we said earlier, there will be no news 
conference tomorrow nor Tuesday evening nor Wednesday morning. 
We hope that the work will be definitely completed. This will 
be reported in due time. 
  Thank you very much for your kindness and understanding.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas State (Mexico), 
28 Feb (EFE) -- Peace in Chiapas is far away because the 
government's answers are still pieces of paper, Subcommander 
Marcos, leader of the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN], 
stated today. "The government's answers are still a bunch of 
papers, and whether it will abide by them remains to be seen. 
Peace is far away; there are only promises. We still have to see 
what the communities have to say," said Marcos. According to 
Marcos, the EZLN is not ready to sign peace. 
  He stated that until now the EZLN talks with Manuel Camacho 
Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, 
have been limited to a dialogue in which "he has responded to 
our 34 demands, but none of them have been negotiated." He said 
the 19 EZLN delegates, who participated in the talks, "have not 
said if we agree with the commissioner's 34 proposals; our 
leaders and grassroots communities must say it." 
  Subcommander Marcos said the Zapatists do not understand the 
government's answers "because they clash with our languages and 
culture. It is impossible to go past the negotiation phase 
because we still do not understand; we have to translate their 
answers into our perception of the world." He stated the San 
Cristobal de las Casas talks are close to an agreement, which 
will later be discussed at the grassroots level, and that the 
first round "will conclude with a document of consultation," 
and after that peace will come. 
  He recognized Camacho Solis' sincerity in the talks but 
wondered to what extent his stance represents the government's. 
"Camacho Solis is telling us what is possible and what is not; 
in some ways he is another mediator." He said there is no 
agreement on democracy, one of the chief demands of the 
Zapatists, at the talks because the government has refused to 
discuss national topics. "The government has refused to discuss 
democracy, refused to discuss amending Article 27, democracy, or 
of recognizing the EZLN as a belligerent force, electoral 
reform, justice, changes in the economic policy, and reforming 
the Free Trade Agreement," he indicated. 
  The top leader of the EZLN reiterated that if President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari does not resign, then there ought to 
be "an electoral change so it is the civilian sector of society 
that controls" the 21 August elections. 
  The EZLN has not thought of surrendering its weapons because 
"a lot of history remains to be covered. Surrendering of our 
weapons is far away, perhaps 500 years away," Marcos stated. For 
him, remaining armed constitutes a guarantee the government 
promises will be kept. He said the Catholic Church has always 
opposed Indians taking up arms, even in its role in Chiapas, it 
has favored" a "collective sentiment of community in the 
Christian sense."

<F P=106> [Report by Victor Torres, Humberto Rios, and Juan de Dios </F>
Garcia] 
  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, 28 Feb -- 
Subcommander Marcos has stated the delays at the negotiating 
table are due to the lack of response from the federal 
government to eight points of national interest related to 
democracy, amendments to the electoral law and the Criminal 
Code, aspects of the ownership and use of land, and respect for 
and a new relationship with Indian communities. 
  The EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] representative 
commented that so far there are "just pieces of paper" at the 
negotiating table. For that reason, he expressed his certainty 
that this phase will conclude without specific agreements. 
Those pieces of paper, he affirmed, do not yet give security or 
guarantees to Indians that they will live well or feed 
themselves. 
  He said those points will have a bearing on the future of 
Mexico and noted the EZLN is not prepared to lay down its 
weapons, since it is certain that the pacification process in 
Chiapas is not simple. The signing of a peace accord, he added, 
will not be fast or easy to attain, and many days will pass in 
order to obtain satisfactory responses to the proposals by the 
EZLN General Command. 
  During a private meeting with foreign correspondents, the 
subcommander felt all the demands on the list submitted to 
Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation 
in Chiapas, can be resolved by the federal authorities with a 
total commitment and interest in improving the conditions in 
which Mexico's Indians live.

<F P=106> [Report by Enrique Tellaeche from Tijuana, Baja California; </F>
from the "Good Morning From Mexico" newscast] 
  [Text] Mexican Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello Macias said 
in Tijuana that there is still time for the U.S. Government to 
reconsider some antimigratory measures to be implemented in 1994 
and 1995 within the framework of a plan presented by U.S. 
Attorney General Janet Reno. 
  At the conclusion of a Mexican Foreign Service meeting in 
preparation for the binational meeting with the United States to 
take place on 7 March in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Tello Macias 
said that there is the possibility that some measures announced 
by the neighbor to the north could be set aside. He rejected 
accusations made Saturday by Chicanos, according to whom the 
Foreign Secretariat spends more resources and time on organizing 
the commemoration of holidays than on providing consular 
protection. 
  Tello Macias said that violence against any single Mexican 
citizen will be considered an act of violence against Mexico's 
integrity. The man responsible for the country's foreign policy 
said he does not know of any plans to construct a barbwire fence 
parallel to the metal fence that already exists along the border.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Guatemalan Army in Guatemala City </F>
on 27 February] 
  [Text] The Guatemalan Army reports to the national and 
international community: 
  1. That the constitutional president of the republic and 
commander general of the Army has preserved the apolitical 
nature of the armed institution since the start of this mandate 
on 6 June 1993. 
  2. That, consequently, the president of Guatemala has never 
tried to involve the Army in political-electoral activities such 
as the recent popular consultation, and has thus fully respected 
the duties that the Constitution of the republic assigned to the 
Armed Forces. 
  3. That, in the same way there has been no presidential 
attempt to manipulate the Army, the president has not issued 
orders to influence the Civilian Self-Defense Voluntary 
Committees either. 
  4. That, in rejecting any claim contrary to the 
aforementioned, the Army is reaffirming its absolute respect for 
the country's institutions and its support for the current 
constitutional government of the Republic headed by Ramiro De 
Leon Carpio. 
  5. That, in view of the need to promote the highest degree 
of well-being for the Guatemalan people, the Army urges all 
segments of the population to intensify efforts in favor of 
harmony, peace, and national reconciliation. 
  [Issued] Guatemala City, 27 February 1994.

  [Text] Rigoberta Menchu, the 1992 Nobel Prize peace 
laureate, stated in Geneva recently, that the [U.S.] military 
presence in Guatemala was detrimental to the people of her 
country. She, thus, asked President Ramiro de Leon Carpio not 
to maintain U.S. troops in the country. 
  Menchu won the coveted prize a year ago. At that time, the 
then government of President Jorge Serrano Elias concocted a 
plot to stop her from receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, although 
it was the first time a Guatemalan citizen received the peace 
prize. Writer Miguel Angel Asturias won the Nobel Prize in 
literature a few years ago. 
  Nevertheless, Jorge Serrano's government refused to 
recognize 
Miss Menchu as the most worthy representative of the country and 
managed to get the important award to remain in Mexico, where it 
still remains. 
  Rigoberto Menchu gave President Ramiro de Leon Carpio her 
personal support but withdrew it a few months later. She 
alleged the current president had let down the Guatemalan people 
and withdrew her support. She continues to observe events in 
the country. 
  For this reason, when she was in Geneva recently, Menchu 
reported that U.S. soldiers had established several camps and 
were carrying out joint military operations in the country. She 
said: "The U.S. Government has decided to send thousands of 
soldiers to interfere in Guatemalan politics. We are denouncing 
this and ask the Guatemalan president to immediately withdraw 
the U.S. troops."

  [Text] The next round of Guatemalan peace talks will take 
place between 3 and 7 March in Mexico City. An AP dispatch 
reported that according to UN officials the main topics to be 
discussed will be human rights and the end of hostilities. A UN 
statement said UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali set the 
dates for the next meeting after consulting with the Guatemalan 
government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity 
(URNG) guerrillas. 
  On 14 February, a Guatemalan Government official said the 
negotiations between the government and the leftist guerrillas 
could produce a peace agreement by the end of the year. Three 
years of negotiations for peace in Guatemala have yielded 
limited results so far. Of an 11-point plan prepared in 1991, 
only partial results have been achieved on one subject: the 
country's democratization. The next round of talks will center 
on the human rights issue and the end of hostilities, according 
to the sources. 
  The guerrilla war in Guatemala has already lasted 34 years 
and claimed 130,000 lives. The debate about the creation of a 
commission for investigating violations of human rights has been 
a serious obstacle in previous negotiation efforts.

<F P=106> [Report by Carlos Catanaza Rosales] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, Guatemalan Defense Minister General Mario 
Rene Enriquez asserted the Guatemalan Army will not accept any 
type of Belizean interference in the country's sovereignty and, 
even less, that they intimidate fellow Guatemalan citizens. The 
top military chief said he fully agreed with Foreign Minister 
Maritza Ruiz de Vielman, who rejected the [Belizean] imposed 
ultimatum on Guatemalan families, as initial investigations, 
carried out by military personnel under the commander of 
Military Zone No. 23 in Peten, indicated. 
  Commenting on the 15-day limit given to Dolores municipality 
residents to abandon their lands, Enriquez emphatically stated: 
"This is totally unjustifiable because the Belizean territory is 
still in dispute. We hope some day this situation will be solved 
in a positive manner. Currently, there are no clear borders, 
however, and the Belizeans are wrong when they say those 
families are in Belizean territory." 
  Enriquez said he had ordered Gen. Marco Antonio Gonzalez 
Taracena, the national defense command staff chief, to attend a 
meeting with Belizean and UK authorities to maintain peace and 
harmony in the area but would prefer it if the threats against 
the Guatemalans are not confirmed. 
  He reported that the Military Zone No. 23 commander has the 
responsibility of investigating and talking to the alleged 
aggressors in this case. The commander, however, must also 
coordinate with the foreign ministry to avoid intimidations, 
Enriquez added. Army Ready to Support Them [subhead] 
  Gen. Enriquez said: "We are ready to support and come to the 
aid of the Guatemalan people in that area." He said meetings 
with Belizean and UK authorities have been taking place prior to 
the government of President Serrano Elias. "The possibility of 
an armed confrontation or military raid in the area is very 
remote. There is friction, however, and several Guatemalan 
citizens have been harassed in different ways. We, of course, 
must support and protect them," he ended.

<F P=106> [Article by Oscar Echenique Bustillo] </F>
  [Text] News from Washington is that the Pentagon itself has 
disclosed that their U.S. military aid to the rest of the world, 
especially continental Latin American countries, will soon be 
reviewed. At the same time, the Pentagon admitted and confirmed 
that it trained military leaders from Latin American countries, 
which were later charged with violating human rights in their 
respective countries. 
  Regarding this, sources from President Clinton's own 
administration have confirmed that the review the Pentagon 
refers to began after it was reported that 45 Army officers from 
neighboring El Salvador, who were trained in the United States, 
have been implicated in the massacre of unarmed civilians in El 
Salvador during the 1980's. This has been confirmed in a report 
by a special UN commission, appointed to investigate this, and 
recently delivered to the amazement of the peoples the world 
over. 
  The special UN report revealed in detail who and how six 
Jesuits were murdered in a San Salvador university, clearly 
establishing the Salvadoran Army's responsibility in this crime, 
which shook the world at the time. 
  What is most ironic in all this is that the Salvadoran 
military members were trained in the School of Americas at Fort 
Benning, Georgia, United States, not to kill priests, but to 
defend democracy and human rights in their country and in Latin 
America. 
  The review the Pentagon refers to is to determine which 
countries are to receive U.S. military and police training and 
equipment. 
  The situation taking place in the United States is of such a 
nature that many of the human rights defense groups in that 
country are pressuring President Clinton to change its programs 
for International Education and Training and for Foreign 
Military Financing, created to encourage stability, democracy, 
and respect for human rights in U.S. allied countries and 
especially in our Latin American countries. 
  There is awareness in the United States that money from 
"gringo" tax payers has been used in the name of the defense of 
democracy and respect for human rights, precisely to violate 
those rights in the countries from which these soldiers came, 
and were educated, taught, and trained in U.S. military schools. 
  In the name of human rights and using democracy as a 
pretext, 
savagery has been committed in Latin America against the 
civilian population, and this continues. One can very well say 
that in a certain way the United States has much to blame with 
what has taken place with regard to human rights, which still 
continues to happen in our countries.

  [Excerpt] Brasilia -- Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso said on 24 February the government will control prices 
that are marked up abusively. Cardoso, noting that the creation 
of the Real Value Unit (URV) will not lead to a price freeze, 
warned that "if prices begin to abusively stray from their 
historic path, we might decide we need to control them." 
  Minister Cardoso said the provisional measure that will 
create the URV will not merely be designed to convert salaries. 
"We are going to make several decisions by respecting contracts 
as much as possible; therefore, no private contracts will be 
broken," he asserted. The minister said the economic team's 
idea is to create some rules to convert some of the workers' 
expenditures, such as rent and school fees, because salaries 
will be converted compulsorily into the new unit. 
  The minister said the longer private prices take to be 
converted into the URV, the better it will be for salary 
earners. "Salaries will be modified automatically according to 
the inflation rate." 
  Action will be taken within 90 days against those 
enterprises 
that mark up prices abusively and will be forced to mark down 
prices to those on a date determined by the government.

  [Excerpts] Brasilia -- During a conversation with deputies 
-- among them the PT [Workers Party] deputy for Rio Grande do 
Sul, Paulo Paim -- Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
said that despite the fact that the Social Emergency Fund 
amendment has not been promulgated, implementation of the 
provisional measure that will enforce the URV [Real Value Unit], 
which will be announced on 28 February, will cause public 
servant salaries to drop. This will happen because the current 
public servant salary policy adjusts salaries for only 50 
percent of inflation every two months. Therefore, at the time of 
conversion into URV's, the average value of the four previous 
months will include that inflationary loss, which will not be 
compensated for. 
  Like in the private sector, public servant salaries will be 
calculated on the basis of the average of the past four months. 
Despite the fact that public sector salaries were increased 192 
percent in January, at their collective agreement renewal date, 
salaries dropped very steeply in December, and this should have 
a negative influence on the average value. According to the 
current salary policy, public sector salaries should have been 
increased by 50 percent of the IRSM [minimum salary readjustment 
index], which would have been equivalent to a final increase of 
45 to 50 percent. Under URV regulations, however, public servant 
salaries will be increased only 20 or 25 percent. 
  This will produce a loss equivalent to approximately the 
inflation rate of one month, special Finance Ministry adviser 
Edmar Bacha admitted during a meeting with PSDB [Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party] deputies and senators in Congress. 
  Economic team advisers assured, however, that contrary to 
what has occurred on other occasions, February's inflation rate 
will not be absorbed by the government stabilization plan. The 
calculation of average salary values for conversion into URV's 
will take into account this month's inflation rate, a technician 
has explained. [passage omitted] 
  During the conversation with Paim, Cardoso assured that the 
conversion of salaries into URV's will not depend on salary 
brackets. "Conversion will be valid for all brackets," Paim 
said. According to him, Cardoso "hinted, in a long talk, that 
the government will make all efforts to give the same treatment 
to prices and salaries." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Brasilia -- Labor Minister Walter Barelli 
disagrees with the economic plan designed by the team of Finance 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso on the grounds that it will 
lead to the deterioration of salaries. If the plan is not 
modified before 28 February, when it will be released, Barelli 
will resign. In an effort to convince Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
that Congress will not approve the plan, Barelli asked for the 
cooperation of PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] President 
Tasso Jereissati -- because party members are dissatisfied with 
implementation of the URV [Real Value Unit]. A PSDB economist 
said that the plan will cause hyperinflation because it will not 
control prices. 
  Barelli did not resign on 24 February only because -- 
clinging to a statement by President Itamar Franco -- he 
insisted on the modification of the plan by 28 February. During 
a meeting between entrepreneurs and unionists on 24 February, 
Vicente de Paula -- the president of the union of Sao Bernardo 
do Campo metalworkers -- appealed to Franco to prevent the 
deterioration of salaries. 
  The president replied that he should rest assured, 
explaining 
that he ordered Barelli to watch the plan's design. "There will 
be no salary deterioration in my government," Franco said.

<F P=106> [Article by Marcia Carmo: "The Discreet Charm of the </F>
Minister"] 
  [Text] Brasilia--On a trip between New York and Tokyo, 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso enchanted the Japanese flight 
attendants who, in tolerable English, wanted to know where he 
buys his beautiful ties. Patiently, he ended up talking about 
his work and his trip, his last as foreign minister, eight 
months ago. This kind of disinterested attention is one of the 
secrets of Fernando Henrique's success in making even enemies 
like him, despite monthly inflation rates of 40 percent. He 
maintains his charm and credibility despite the current economic 
situation and partial defeat of his stabilization plan at the 
hands of Congress. 
  "I do not know the reason for this charisma, I only know I 
have the deepest admiration for him and really envy him for it," 
admits Deputy and former Minister Roberto Campos (PPR-RJ) 
[Progressive Renewal Party, Rio de Janeiro State]. "This success 
of his is a mystery. With inflation rates like these, I would 
have been tarred and feathered." The enigmatic success of 
Fernando Henrique, 62--a senator, the son of a military officer, 
and grandfather of three--generates envy, especially within the 
administration. It is believed in some offices along the 
Esplanade, for example, that his secret has to do with being in 
the good graces of the media. "Fernando is incredible," 
President Itamar Franco never tires of repeating when people ask 
him why the finance minister holds onto his job. 
  "I do not know whether I would be as lucky with the press," 
he commented, recently. Itamar uses very few words to justify 
his faith in his government's fourth finance minister. "Our 
friendship is fraternal. I believe in his work, and his plans 
make sense, logical sense." 
<H5>  Fascination </H5>
  Still, the president is also impressed by Fernando 
Henrique's 
personality; he finds him an intelligent academic. It is 
stimulating to deal with him, notes a diplomat who worked with 
Fernando Henrique for seven months at Itamaraty. Perhaps this 
explains the fascination that even his closest aides feel for 
him. "The minister has an electrifying personality, and anyone 
who talks with him is almost bound to be charmed." 
  A man of many interests--he adores politics, science and 
technology, theater, music, the visual arts, and buying 
meringues at the corner bakery--Fernando Henrique is genuine, 
according to those who work with him. This could be yet another 
explanation for why he is still unscathed despite the economic 
crisis. 
  "The finance minister has worked alone. He is his own man, 
whether in the Executive or the Legislative Branch," argues 
former Minister Mailson da Nobrega, who once held the same 
portfolio and is now a successful businessman in Sao Paulo. 
Mailson took over the economy during the Sarney administration 
when inflation was running at about 15 percent a month. By the 
time he got out, the rate had risen to the incredible level of 
84 percent. Even so, he was not scorned. Which also goes to show 
that the Fernando Henrique phenomenon has occurred before. 
<H5>  Secret </H5>
  "Today I can walk the streets in peace, and people even 
mention me with a certain affection," Mailson reports. He tries 
to explain that charm is not enough to bewitch the voters in 
times of high inflation rates. "Credibility is the secret," he 
said. "In Fernando Henrique's case, this is explained by his 
background, his resume, integrity, and work ethic." Mailson and 
a former minister in the Itamar administration who once occupied 
FHC's chair but prefers to remain anonymous would almost go so 
far as to say that Fernando Henrique is irreplaceable at the 
helm of the economy. 
  "He is the tent pole that you had better not kick," remarked 
Mailson. "He is not that good, but the possibility of replacing 
him could lead to the uncertainty of hyperinflation," the other 
former minister commented. Antonio Britto, a former colleague in 
the Cabinet, is another who spares no praise for the finance 
chief and his plans, even though he [Britto] did not show up for 
last Thursday's vote on the provisional measures. "He tells the 
country the truth. And since the country is tired of magicians 
and lies, now it believes he really knows that the right road is 
the one he wants us to take." Whatever the secret of Fernando 
Henrique's success, and even with high inflation rates, the 
number of letters addressed to the Ministry of Finance grows 
with every passing day. Most are from women, who are 
particularly concerned about his backaches.

  [Excerpts] Sao Paulo -- Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio 
Fleury will boycott today's meeting of the PMDB [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party] state Executive Board, at which 
former Governor Orestes Quercia intends to request the party's 
support for his candidacy for the presidency. Fleury is not a 
member of the Executive Board and therefore his presence at the 
meeting is not mandatory. Executive Board Chairman Roberto 
Rollemberg wanted to take advantage of this meeting to ask 
Quercia and Fleury to make up their minds about their 
candidacies. 
  Fleury's strategy is to stall for time so as to avoid giving 
an answer to Quercia's request to endorse his candidacy. Fleury 
still dreams about the possibility of being chosen by the PMDB 
to run for the presidency. He feels his name could be an 
alternative for the party in light of the rejection of Quercia's 
candidacy by national leaders and [Deputy] Antonio Britto's 
[PMDB-Rio Grande do Sul] refusal to stand as a PMDB candidate. 
[passage omitted] 
  Deputy Luiz Carlos Santos [PMDB-Sao Paulo] -- government 
leader in the Chamber of Deputies and anti-Quercia -- is a 
member of the PMDB state Executive Board, but on 20 February did 
not know whether he would attend the meeting. Santos is 
scheduled to go to Bandeirantes Palace [Sao Paulo Government 
House], but he argues that prior commitments in Brasilia will 
prevent him from participating in both meetings. From the PMDB 
bloc in the Chamber of Deputies, Luiz Carlos Santos, Jorge Tadeu 
Mudalen, Ari Kara, Roberto Rollemberg, Wagner Rossi, Walter 
Nory, and Maurici Mariano are considered faithful to Fleury, 
whereas Alberto Goldman, Marcelo Barbieri, Paulo Novaes, Carlos 
Nelson, and Manoel Moreira are considered pro-Quercia. Quercia 
has a large majority on the executive boards of the interior and 
in nearly 300 municipalities.

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho has 
sealed an agreement with former Governor Orestes Quercia to 
support the latter's candidacy for the presidency of the 
Republic. The first meeting to discuss this issue occurred on 
the afternoon of 6 February at Bandeirantes Palace. Since then 
the two have been regularly discussing the issue. On 20 
February, they ratified what had been agreed upon over the phone. 
  This was reported by a Brazilian Democratic Movement Party 
[PMDB] deputy close to Fleury. The deputy allegedly was told all 
that by the governor himself. He also heard Fleury clearly say 
that he did not plan to confront Quercia. Deputy Alberto Goldman 
heard exactly the same sentence during the governor's meeting 
with the federal deputies' bloc in Sao Paulo on 21 February. 
  After creating much confusion in the PMDB and threatening to 
confront the former governor, Fleury allegedly reversed his 
decision to try obtaining PMDB support for his presidential 
candidacy. In the party it is believed that Quercia cornered -- 
a term used by the PMDB leaders -- the governor and left him no 
option but to support his candidacy because he controls the PMDB 
in Sao Paulo. 
  Fleury probably will not admit the agreement publicly. His 
strategy is to postpone, as much as possible, an official 
announcement of his decision to support Quercia because he fears 
attacks by the PMDB national leaders who oppose the former 
governor. Reportedly, Fleury plans to continue circulating among 
those who oppose Quercia -- such as the government leader in the 
Senate, Pedro Simon (PMDB-RS [Rio Grande do Sul]); Deputy 
Antonio Britto (PMDB- RS); and Brazilian Social Democracy Party 
politicians -- for as long as he manages to save face. In the 
next few weeks, Fleury will continue to support the talk that it 
is still not time to think about candidacies and the most 
important thing now is to maintain the party's unity and ensure 
the economic plan's approval. 
  Quercia's tranquillity also reinforces the agreement thesis. 
The former governor continues to assert that Fleury will support 
his candidacy. Both the Quercia-led faction and Fleury, however, 
deny reaching an agreement. The Quercia faction fears Fleury 
will break the agreement if he sees any possibility of becoming 
a presidential candidate himself. Particularly, if Quercia's 
candidacy is rejected by the party. 
  Fleury promised on 21 February to officially announce his 
decision on the presidential candidacy "within 20 days." 
According to PMDB State Chairman Roberto Rollemberg, it is 
expected that this issue will have been settled by 7 March, when 
the PMDB Regional Executive Board is scheduled to hold a meeting 
-- which Quercia and Fleury will attend -- to decide on 
Quercia's candidacy. 
  Rollemberg asserted that "one thing is certain -- we will 
never go to the convention with two candidates from Sao Paulo. 
It is either Quercia or Fleury." According to Rollemberg, 
Quercia is the only candidate the party has so far. He said: 
"If Fleury decides to launch his candidacy for the presidency, 
we will convene a party meeting in Sao Paulo to settle the 
question."

<F P=106> [Article by Luiz Orlando Carneiro] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia--Brazil could gain seven more states and 
three new territories with the stroke of a pen. All that would 
have to happen is for the various proposals to create new units 
in the federation to be approved during the constitutional 
revision. Intended for insertion in the final section of the 
Constitution--the so-called Transitory Constitutional Provisions 
Act--these amendments are designed to circumvent the limits 
imposed earlier, in Article 18, as was done in 1988, when the 
state of Tocantins was created. Added to the map of Brazil would 
be names of states like Iguacu, Tapajos, Triangulo, Carajas, 
Aripuana, Piratini, and Sao Paulo do Sul, and territories like 
Jurua, Alto Solimoes, and Araguaia. 
  Although the proposals for new states and territories have 
strong support in Congress, the trend among the rapporteurs of 
the revision (as acknowledged by one of them, Pernambuco Deputy 
Gustavo Krause of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party]) is to prevent them from being created under the umbrella 
of the Transitory Provisions. Deputy Nelson Jobim (PMDB, Rio 
Grande do Sul), the rapporteur-general, has already published an 
opinion that would modify Article 18 to make it harder to create 
new states or territories. The process would have to begin "at 
the bottom and work up to the top," with proposals originating 
with the state legislatures instead of the national Congress. 
The requirement for a plebiscite and enactment of a 
complementary law to regulate the subject are retained. 
  This is not the first we have heard of attempts to create 
the 
states of Triangulo (from Uberlandia, Uberaba, and other cities 
in the Minas Triangle) and Iguacu. The lobby [preceding word in 
English] is back in action now because of the constitutional 
revision, and it has the support of legislators from the North 
and West Central regions who want to add the states of Tapajos, 
Carajas, and Aripuana to the map. This would mean that on 3 
October they could elect governors, senators, and federal and 
state deputies. If seven states were created, the Chamber would 
have 57 more deputies and the Senate 21 more members. 
<H5>  Reconfiguration </H5>
  Deputy Hilario Coimbra (PTB-PA) [Brazilian Labor Party, Para 
State], author of one of the amendments to create the state of 
Tapajos, speaks of the "unquestionable need" to reconfigure the 
area known as the Legal Amazon. He points out that the 
Commission on Territorial Studies, instituted in the Congress in 
1989 in compliance with the Transitory Provisions of the 
Constitution, favored having more federated units in the region, 
among them the state of Tapajos, "as an effective requisite for 
promoting a stronger regional economy." Tapajos would be carved 
out of Para. Its capital would be Santarem and it would have 18 
municipalities, including Itaituba, in the gold-mining area. 
  The same economics-based arguments are cited to justify the 
creation of Carajas (incorporating 32 municipalities from Para, 
including Tucurui, Sao Felix do Xingu, and Sao Domingos do 
Araguaia) and Aripuana (taking 14 municipalities from Rondonia 
and Mato Grosso, including Aripuana, Vilhena, and Alta Floresta 
D'Oeste). 
  The state of Triangulo, were it to be created, would absorb 
79 Minas municipalities, some of them--like Uberaba, Uberlandia, 
Araxa, and Araguari--being among the wealthiest in the state. By 
including Paracatu and Joao Pinheiro, the new state would come 
close to Brasilia. 
  More than 150 municipalities would be detached from 
southwestern Parana and northwestern Santa Catarina states to 
form the state of Iguacu, whose leading cities would be Foz do 
Iguacu, Cascavel, and Guaira. The new state would steal from 
Parana the town of Sete Quedas and the busiest part of the 
border with Paraguay. 
  The proposal to create the state of Piratini sprouted from a 
people's amendment. The state would share borders with Uruguay, 
Argentina, and the southern municipalities of Sao Borja, 
Cachoeira do Sul, and Rio Pardo, among others. The number of 
municipalities in the new state has not yet been determined, but 
some of the most important cities in Rio Grande do Sul 
State--such as Pelotas, Santa Maria, and Bage--would be among 
them, as would almost all of Lagoa dos Patos. 
  The southern cone of what is now Sao Paulo State would 
become 
Sao Paulo do Sul. The subject of an amendment submitted by the 
PSD [Democratic Social Party], it would have as boundaries the 
municipalities of Peruibe, Parapanema, and Piraju. The current 
boundaries of Sao Paulo State with Parana State and the Atlantic 
ocean would be preserved. Among the municipalities in the new 
state would be Cananeia, Iguape, and Ribeira. The state's 
Atlantic coast would extend from Peruibe to Cananeia. 
<H5>  Territories </H5>
  Conversion of the former territories of Amapa and Roraima 
into states and reincorporation of Fernando de Noronha into 
Pernambuco would leave Brazil with no territories. Three 
proposals to reinvent territories have been made as part of the 
constitutional revision A "people's proposal" favors creation of 
the territory of Alto Solimoes; another suggestion, from Senator 
Louremberg Nunes Rocha (PPR-MT) [Progressive Renewal Party, Mato 
Grosso], would set up the territory of Araguaia; a third, from 
Deputy Pauderney Avelino (PPR, Amazonas), institutes the 
territory of Jurua. 
  All the proposals cite as justification the tremendous size 
of the Amazon area, its sparse population, and the need for 
effective settlement of the region "from the strategic 
standpoint." 
  Jurua would be cut from Acre State (Cruzeiro do Sul) and 13 
municipalities from Amazonas. Alto Solimoes would have Peru and 
Colombia as its boundaries, in addition to Amazonian 
municipalities. The territory of Araguaia would be comprised of 
a significant part of the valley of the river of the same name, 
and Para State would form its northern boundary.

<F P=106> [Report by "special correspondent" Jose Maria Mayrink in </F>
Havana] 
  [Text] Brazilian citizens Rodolfo Andriani and Leonardo 
Fares, who were in Havana in late January to negotiate an energy 
deal with the Cuban Government, were satisfied with the first 
contacts made. The businessmen commented: "Judging from the 
development of the negotiations, it is quite likely we will 
establish a joint venture [preceding word in English] in the 
next two or three months." 
  Andriani is general director of Inepar Trading, a Parana 
State company trying to enter the Cuban market with Audiolab 
Electronic Systems, from Belo Horizonte, of which Fares is 
president. The idea is to refurbish thermoelectric plants and, 
eventually, participate in the nuclear project. 
  "The Cubans accept any deal," said the Brazilian businessmen 
after observing the speed with which the representatives of the 
socialist public enterprises close deals with foreign 
capitalists. 
  In Brazil's case, some previous agreements at the government 
level have expedited the negotiations. Brazilian Ambassador 
Jose Nogueira Filho, who has been in Cuba for about one year, 
commented: "In the transportation field, for example, the Cubana 
de Aviacion airline already has one flight a week between Havana 
and Sao Paulo, and soon we will have a Brazilian airline 
covering this route." 
  Moreover, a Cypriot shipping company has a regular service 
between the Cuban ports and Belem, in Para State, where it 
unloads cement and loads timber. The trade balance currently 
tilts in Cuba's favor. Last year Cuba exported goods worth $21 
million and imported goods worth $9 million. The volume this 
year will be even larger. 
  Prospects are also good in the tourism field, where the 
Cuban 
Government has focused its investments. The first deals already 
have been made, and Spaniards are Cuba's main partners in this 
field. In 1993 the hotel business made $600 million. This 
year, with an income of more than $1 billion, the hotel business 
should surpass sugar production. Canadians and Venezuelans also 
are interested in this sector. 
  Foreign capitalists have even greater interest. Chilean and 
Israeli businessmen have engaged in fruit production while the 
French, Canadians, and Swedish are interested in oil 
prospecting. A South American diplomat tells business people 
inquiring about the prospects in Cuba: "The only risk of 
investing in Cuba is that the United States might lift the 
embargo because, if so, then they will crush the competitors."

  [Text] Campo Grande -- The seizure on 23 February of 305 kg 
of highly pure cocaine at a police post on BR-262 highway -- 23 
km from Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul State [MS] -- revealed 
a new drug trafficking route. The drug traffickers now are 
crossing through the town of Tres Lagoas in eastern MS on the 
Sao Paulo State [SP] border. As a result of an investigation of 
fast fortunes, Federal Police discovered a gang of Tres Lagoas 
farmers and businessmen. The head of the gang, Osvaldir Garcia, 
belongs to one the town's established families. 
  Police received information about the drugs but could not 
seize the first cargo of 338 kg, which was delivered a month 
ago. The seized cocaine was bought in Bolivia for $2,000 per 
kilo and hidden in a secret compartment in the chassis of a dump 
truck with license plate FV-4435 from Andradina (SP). The truck, 
which was being towed because its engine was ruined, had been 
assembled in the Bolivian town of Puerto Quijarro, on the MS 
border. 
  Part of the cocaine was being sent to Rio de Janeiro, where 
it would be sold for $7,000 per kilo, and also to Europe, where 
it would be sold for $40,000 per kilo. Police arrested truck 
driver Claudio Goncalves, 39, and tow truck driver Benedito 
Cardoso Filho, and are holding them at the Federal Police 
Superintendency in Campo Grande. Osvaldir Garcia and three 
other drug traffickers escaped, but their preventive arrest 
already has been decreed.

  [Text] Samta Fe de Bogota, 16 Feb -- Colombian President 
Cesar Gaviria Trujillo granted an interview to Japanese 
reporters, including one from YOMIURI SHIMBUN, on 16 February. 
In the interview, the president revealed his plan to visit 
Japan from 26 February to 3 March. He also indicated his 
intention during his visit to urge Japan to invest in Colombia. 
  President Gaviria said: "I have concrete aims for my visit, 
such as promotion of relations with Japan in the technical 
field." The president expressed his hope that Japan's loans will 
be increased to assist Colombia in setting up a research center 
designed to enhance productivity and competitive power in the 
manufacturing industry, as well as in improving production 
facilities in large oil fields. Moreover, he stated that the 
country had no rescheduling (deferring debt repayment) in the 
1980's. The president requested Japan to increase loans, 
saying: "The international financial circles have highly 
evaluated that Colombia has completed repayment of foreign 
debts. I hope that the Japanese financial circle will deepen 
connections with Colombia."

  [Text] Havana, 25 Feb (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina said today in this capital that the holding of a 
conference with representatives of Cuban emigrants will take 
away from the United States the banner it has traditionally 
brandished against Cuba. 
  During a conversation with Mexican legislators visiting the 
Caribbean island -- a conversation to which PRENSA LATINA had 
access -- the foreign minister said this fact is the first 
achievement of the preparations now under way for the meeting 
scheduled for April. 
  We are reaching out a hand and a bridge to those who want to 
maintain normal relations with our country, and those who say 
they have nothing to talk to us about have excluded themselves, 
he added. 
  Answering questions from the visitors, Robaina said the idea 
behind the conference is to speak to people who are living 
abroad for different reasons, and he noted that family ties 
cannot be broken because of ideological positions. 
  Among the opportunities presented by the conference, the 
minister noted possible academic exchanges, the possible 
granting of scholarships to emigrants wishing to study in Cuba, 
and the editing of publications for Cubans living abroad. 
  Robaina also said paperwork for entering and leaving Cuba 
could be facilitated, because "the time has come to change rigid 
rules" that have always been prompted by the aggressive attitude 
of certain sectors now trying to exert pressure once again to 
discourage attendance at the conference. 
  We believe normal relations with Cuban emigrants constitute 
one of the elements that can help change U.S. Government policy 
so that the pressure from those inciting violence against Cuba 
will cease to exist, as well as the pressure exerted on those 
who are opposed to the hysteria, he noted. 
  Robaina said different conditions exist today, and this is 
why the emigrants have already said they want to attend the 
conference and talk about a future of acceptable ties with their 
country of origin.

<F P=106> [Report by Aissa G. Garcia] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 17 Feb (PL) -- Representatives of Cuban 
emigre organizations in the United States today agreed that the 
Cuban Government's call to the conference "The Nation and 
Emigration," which will be held here in April, is an important 
step. 
  PRENSA LATINA spoke by telephone with Raymundo Del Toro, 
president of the Cuban-American Committee for Peace (CCAP), and 
with Walfredo Moreno, leader of the Alliance of Workers of the 
Community (ATC). 
  Del Toro said the initiative shows the goodwill of the 
people 
in accepting their brothers who live outside the fatherland. 
  The CCAP has 17,000 members and is headquartered in New 
Jersey, the state with the second largest concentration of 
Cubans in the United States after Florida. 
  About the meeting, the most recent precedent for which was 
in 
1978, Del Toro stated: "They call us once again to share and 
listen to our worries and aspirations." 
  On 14 February, the Cuban authorities announced the 
convocation of a meeting on 22, 23, and 24 April in which over 
200 representatives of the Cuban community residing in other 
nations are expected to participate. 
  Although the topics on the agenda and the list of 
participants have not yet been defined, Havana made it clear 
that those who want to destroy the country and support the U.S. 
blockade have been excluded from the meeting. 
  Del Toro said the decision not to invite organizations such 
as the Cuban-American Foundation and the terrorist groups Alpha 
66 and "19 April" L (Liberty) Commando Units, among others that 
have spoken out against the people and for the blockade, was 
fair. 
  Those groups do not represent the Cuban community residing 
in 
the United States, but the interests of Washington and the CIA 
(Central Intelligence Agency), he added. 
  He said that recent polls showed that 83 percent of emigres 
residing in Miami favor the elimination of the economic 
sanctions imposed on Cuba over 30 years ago. 
  For his part, the president of the ATC stated that the 
convocation to the conference has scared "the worms" 
(ultraright-wing sector of the emigres) and encouraged those who 
favor the ties with Havana. 
  Moreno said the initiative has left the most reactionary 
sector of the community without arguments. Those sectors wish 
to perpetuate the blockade, the main cause of the economic 
crisis in the country. 
  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina recently said the 
Government has the willingness to smooth edges and solve 
differences with the community, whose relations with the Cuban 
Government were manipulated or undermined by the enemies of the 
revolution.

  [Text] Camaguey, Cuba, 26 Feb (PL) -- Representatives of 
the Cuban community residing abroad and local experts today 
concluded a seminar-workshop on participative democracy, which 
was held for three days here. This seminar-workshop is the last 
of other such events held here since last year. 
  Grouped in commissions and in the plenary, the participants 
analyzed the practice and facets of social administration in 
Cuba, the National Information Agency has stated. 
  Amalio Fiallo, director of the Center for the Promotion of 
Man (PROHOMBRE) based in Caracas, main speaker of the meeting, 
analyzed the fundamentals of participative society, an issue 
discussed last December at a meeting held in this provincial 
capital located 550 km east of Havana. 
  Cubans for three decades have been the promoters of a united 
society, a society against individualism and greed, the 
participants of the meeting, also organized by Miami's 
CONTRAPUNTO magazine, concluded at that time. 
  The forum, the second of which is held in the interior of 
the 
country, is financed by the Hans Seidel Foundation based in 
Bavaria, Germany. 
  The first seminar on participative democracy was held last 
March in Havana, with the participation of prominent 
personalities of the Cuban State and Government. 
  Similar meetings have been held over the past three years in 
Miami, New York, Tampa, Washington, as well as Puerto Rico, 
Venezuela, and Spain. More than 1,000 Cubans residing abroad 
have attended the aforementioned meetings.

<F P=106> [Report by Ruben Cortes: "Cuban Exile Hard-liners Play Last </F>
Cards in Favor of Blockade"] 
  [Text] Mexico City, 26 Feb (PL) -- The most recalcitrant 
Cuban exiles in the United States are playing their last few 
cards to maintain the economic blockade against Cuba, Andres 
Gomez, leader of the Antonio Maceo Brigade in Miami, said in 
Mexico City. "They are moving fast because they know that if 
they do not succeed in reversing the actions they criticize, 
they will have lost too much ground as the result of internal 
and external circumstances," Gomez said. 
  During an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Gomez, who is also 
director of AREITO magazine, said there is a big tug-of-war 
between opposing sides of the Cuban community in the United 
States. 
  "Those who favor better relations with Cuba have gained 
ground since Washington lifted the economic sanctions against 
Vietnam and because of the pro-Cuba activities of an increasing 
number of U.S. citizens," he added. 
  Gomez emphasized the work of the U.S. ecumenical 
organization 
Pastors for Peace, which in 1992 and 1993 breached the blockade 
by taking humanitarian aid from the continental United States to 
Cuba, clearly violating the embargo. "Pastors for Peace are 
again gathering goods for the island. Unlike previous years, 
this time the authorities are giving them plenty of leeway. I 
think this is an encouraging sign," Gomez added. 
  The director of AREITO also mentioned the effort of New York 
Democrat Congressman Charles Rangel, who on 17 March will 
present Congress with a proposal to call off the embargo. 
  Gomez believes that, in view of the situation, the most 
recalcitrant exiles must make a show of force or risk losing the 
traditional government support they have enjoyed since the 
triumph of the Cuban revolution in 1959. 
  "That is why they organized an event on Capitol Hill in 
Washington on Thursday. They rally was attended by only 1,000 
people despite the presence of Robert Torricelli, the 
congressman who succeeded in having the embargo tightened in 
1992." 
  "The recalcitrant ones expected to rally at least 10,000 
people. They rented planes and buses in Miami, New Jersey, and 
other cities, but the event was a political failure. The 
hard-liners know it, and they are worried," he said. 
  Gomez recalled that Cuban community hard-liners rallied 
50,000 people in Miami in October for a similar event. "Of 
course, the fact that only 1,000 people rallied in Washington 
does not indicate an absolute loss of rallying power. Moving 
people a couple of blocks away from home is not the same as 
moving them thousands of kilometers away. Nevertheless, the 
refusal to make the effort that all this entails is an 
indication of little interest in the activity," he said. 
  Gomez is in Mexico City to participate in an International 
Book Fair, where he will lecture on the book Cuba In the 
Face of Cynical Logic [Cuba Ante La Razon Cinica] written 
by Heinz Dietrich Steffan.

<F P=106> [TRABAJADORES article by Nicanor Leon Cotayo for PRENSA </F>
LATINA: "Effects of the Blockade on Medical Assistance in 
Cuba"; first paragraph is Nicanor Leon Cotayo introduction] 
  [Text] During the research I have conducted for 15 years 
-- with the cooperation of the Ministry of Public Health, 
particularly its economic section -- concerning Washington's 
policy of isolation against Cuba, I delved into the following 
issues. In my opinion, they are particularly significant at a 
time when the UN Human Rights Commission holds its annual 
meeting in Geneva. 
  Havana -- One of the main goals sought by the U.S. blockade 
against Cuba has been to obstruct medical aid to the population 
in an effort to undermine support for the island's leaders. 
  The White House believed this action would be effective 
because more than 40,000 pharmaceutical and medical products 
(medicine, reagents, disposable material, surgical equipment, 
and others) were registered in Cuba up to 1959. More than 80 
percent of the products were sent by foreign firms, basically 
U.S. firms, while Cuban laboratories purchased most of the raw 
materials for their production -- low at the time -- in the 
United States. 
  Aware of this dependence, U.S. officials worked hard to 
obstruct that bilateral supply until it was suspended early in 
the 1960's. They have later tried everything within their means 
to force the rest of the world to do likewise. 
  The situation substantially worsened for the Cubans 
following 
the disappearance of socialist markets in the Soviet Union and 
Eastern Europe, which served to considerably lessen the general 
effects of the blockade for more than 30 years. 
  Under these circumstances, aside from receiving less income 
in convertible currency, Cuba was compelled to pay higher costs 
in freight and product prices -- given the distances and given 
the special deals with businessmen who render their services or 
supply medical products despite the risk of paying the sanctions 
imposed by the U.S. blockade. 
  As a result of this, on a given year within the first half 
of 
the 1990's, Cuba had to disburse an extra $45 million to cover 
its public health needs. Had it not been for the blockade, the 
amount would have allowed, to use an example, the purchase of 
enough powdered milk to produce 180 million liters of this 
product. 
  One of the most negative effects of the U.S. policy of 
isolation is the high cost of freight paid to import merchandise 
from ports and airports in Europe and other distant areas. 
  Cuba: Were it not for the astronomical freight prices.... 
  It is appropriate to remember that, since the implementation 
of this line of conduct, the White House has forbidden U.S. 
ships to load merchandise shipped from any country to Cuba or to 
dock at any Cuban port; and in 1962 it established the so-called 
"black list" of ships from other countries that traded with the 
island. The provision to be removed from that list was to 
suspend all trade with the island. 
  It is well known that this case history was somehow recast 
in 
1992 for the so-called Torricelli amendment, to officially 
threaten with strong sanctions the ships that carried any 
merchandise to Cuba. 
  As of 1993, official statistics show Havana had an annual 
expense of $6 million in air and maritime freight for the public 
health sector. The amount would have been $1 million or $2 
million if the cargo had been purchased in markets located 
nearby and under the normal circumstances which surround these 
deals. 
  The effects of the blockade are simultaneously reflected in 
a 
foreign debt increase and a greater disbursement of hard 
currency given the excessive cost of freight, air freight in 
many cases, to guarantee the prompt arrival of critical products 
which guarantee the health -- sometimes the life -- of human 
beings. 
  The frequent use of air freight, despite the fact it is 
much more expensive than sea freight, is because under current 
circumstances Cuba's medical reserves do not always allow the 
long waiting time by sea, in addition to the fact the blockade 
also restrictions affect the availability of vessels. 
  The following is one example that illustrates this. 
  As already known, Cuba has been affected by a neuropathy 
epidemic. Airfreight costs from Europe amounted to $237,448 
just to cover a partial shipment of a contract for vitamins and 
excipients (a substance that dissolves) to manufacture tablets 
for the sick and as a preventive measure for the rest of the 
population. 
  Had the blockade not forbidden access to the U.S. market and 
access to nearby U.S. affiliates, to acquire these products 
freight costs would have been $55,900. In other words, Cuba had 
to pay $101,548 extra for just one of the many transactions 
carried out to face this epidemic. 
  Another case. 
  When examining payments made between 1991 to 1992 for 32 
products used in medical assistance from Europe, one can see in 
airfreight alone $26,037 was spent. From the United States this 
would have only amounted to $2,413. 
  With the $23,624, which Cuba was forced to pay due to the 
blockade, Cuba could have purchased 10,453 packages of 
methotrexate, which is used to treat children suffering from 
acute leukemia, in other words, 87 percent of this product's 
yearly requirement. 
  The Obsession To Leave Cuba Without Medicine [subhead] 
  For three decades the White House explicitly forbad Cuba to 
acquire medicines in the U.S. market, the world's most 
important. At the time, THE NEW YORK TIMES harshly criticized 
this. 
  Something similar occurs with chemical reagents, which are 
essential for the clinical analysis that guarantees health 
services to the people and vital products for the development of 
the medical- pharmaceutical industry. 
  The U.S. siege surrounding these essential materials has 
forced Cuba to pay between 30 to 40 percent more to 
intermediaries and spend more time to obtain the products it 
needs, sometimes urgently. 
  If one considers the fact Cuba has very few financial 
resources, one can better understand all the efforts the Cuban 
authorities have to make to maintain the level of medical 
assistance Cuba has, despite everything. 
  The neuropathy epidemic serves as an example for a better 
idea regarding this. 
  Let's take, among the numerous documents, a contract Cuban 
sanitary officials made available to me, covering only three 
products (reagents) earmarked to fight the neuropathy epidemic, 
which were purchased from a European supplier. The complete 
operation, including freight, cost $1,938 per shipment. 
  To have some idea of how this affects the Cuban economy, 
let's say that according to the price catalogue of the U.S. firm 
Sigma, had there not been a blockade, the f.o.b. [free on board] 
price for these products would have been $827; that is, 134 
percent less for each purchase. 
  If this saving could have been made, with the money 
difference, approximately 2,485 milliliters of cattle fetal 
serum could have been obtained. This is an essential reagent 
component used to test pregnant women for abnormal fetuses. 
  Another comparison serves to demonstrate more crudely the 
realities of this uncommon process. 
  A contract for 1992 to 1993 which includes prices of 24 
medical products turns out to be particularly significant when 
it is compared with the supply of similar merchandise offered by 
Miami- based Talgrex International Export Company. 
  In one single purchase, $986,386 in excess of the prices 
announced by Talgrex were invested. This does not include the 
burden that was imposed additionally by the freight. 
  For instance, one of the medications included in that 
contract, the niphedipine [nifedipine], which is used for 
treating cardiovascular disease, cost Havana $111.67, while in 
the Talgrex catalog it was sold for $61.56, namely 81 percent 
less. 
  There is another angle to the problem -- the multiple 
obstacles that the blockade creates for Cuba when it wants to 
obtain specific medication. The situation worsens even more when 
it is necessary to resort to a costly and prolonged medication. 
  Third generation antibiotics are part of this intricate 
general context. They are an essential part of the work carried 
out at intensive care units and the cytostatic treatment of 
cancer patients. 
  An important U.S. company, Lilly, and its branches in Latin 
America manufacture insulin, which -- as it is well known -- is 
essential for diabetic patients. However, these companies 
refuse, using the blockade as an excuse, to sell this product to 
Cuba, which has tried to resort to the distant European market 
to guarantee medical attention for these persons. 
  There are 16.5 diabetics for every 1,000 inhabitants on the 
island, and a considerable part of them are insulin dependent. 
This means their lives are closely linked to the existence or 
lack of this much sought after pharmaceutical product. 
  Please ... give handicapped Cubans a chance in Geneva. 
  Another significant example is shown in Havana's relations 
with the Dutch firm Enraf Nonius, which supplied equipment and 
spare parts for the rehabilitation of handicapped patients until 
1991, to the extreme that 80 percent of the facilities came from 
that source. 
  On 16 July 1991 the Dutch company sent a message to the 
Cuban 
capital notifying that it was suspending its shipments because 
George Bush's Republican government did not grant it the 
authorizations demanded by the blockade for products which have 
a certain degree of U.S. components. 
  Since this step jeopardized the treatment of numerous 
handicapped patients, the Caribbean nation's authorities were 
compelled, as in other cases, to seek more costly solutions in 
the world despite the country's precarious financial situation. 
  In the technology sector, the Cuban health system is 
compelled, essentially by the blockade, to resort to 
extraordinary measures to purchase textbooks and magazines, 
while facing multiple limitations when its specialists want to 
participate in courses and scientific meetings held in the 
United States. 
  Books also fall prey to this attitude. The Spanish firm 
Inter- American Publishers House, Inc. sold Cuba the medical 
books it needed, but transactions were suspended in 1991 when 
the enterprise was bought by the U.S. firm McGraw-Hill. 
  Despite all this Cuba has achieved extraordinary development 
in the public health sector, a fact that is recognized even by 
relevant members of U.S. scientific institutions which have 
participated in neuropathy research since 1993 in what 
represents the pioneer group involved in a noble activity that 
should be carried out some day in the third world. 
  What the United Nations now demands as a foremost goal for 
underdeveloped nations on the brink of a new millennium, Cuba 
already achieved and surpassed years ago -- sometimes at levels 
that are similar to the ones which currently prevail in 
developed countries. In fact, it protects its basic 
achievements in this area despite Washington's systematic 
efforts to jeopardize its health care system. Those efforts are 
part of an overall plan to create internal problems and 
undermine the lifestyle which currently prevails on the island 
and, eventually, cause it to revert.

  [Text] Washington, 24 Feb (PL) -- Today ultrarightist 
groups staged a demonstration in this capital to confirm their 
support for the blockade against Cuba at a time when demands are 
being made for the U.S. Government to change its policy toward 
Cuba. 
  Four U.S. congressmen, including Robert Torricelli -- the 
author of the law that intensifies the blockade against Cuba -- 
spoke during the demonstration, which was planned by the Cuban 
Unity Movement [Movimiento Unidad Cubana]. 
  Florida's Republican Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and 
Lincoln Diaz Balart, as well as New Jersey's Democratic 
Representative Robert Menendez, spoke at the demonstration. 
They all expressed their support for maintaining the 
restrictions, which have cost Cuba over $40 billion in the past 
three decades. 
  Some 1,000 people, who arrived in three planes and 12 buses 
from Miami, took part in this demonstration in front of the 
Capitol. 
  A spokesperson for the organization called International 
Peace for Cuba [Internacional Paz Para Cuba] told PRENSA LATINA 
by telephone that the demonstration was staged to protest a 
draft bill proposed by New York's Democratic Representative 
Charles Rangel, who will submit said bill for discussion before 
four congressional committees on 17 February [date as received]. 
  Rangel's draft bill, which is called the Free Trade With 
Cuba 
Act, has the support of 30 U.S. congress members, religious 
leaders, businessmen, academicians, and the moderate sector of 
the Cuban- American community. 
  Paul Asure, an International Peace for Cuba spokesman, said 
that the demonstration's organizers sought to get the attention 
of U.S. Government leaders in a context in which they are 
increasingly becoming a minority, as they are listened to less 
and less. 
  Asure added that they see themselves as losing strength in 
their efforts to smother Cuba and are trying to make noise. 
However, they are faced with the current situation where people 
in the United States and most members of the Cuban-American 
community are pressing Washington to change its policy toward 
Cuba. 
  On 12 February the so-called International Peace for Cuba 
organized a demonstration in favor of Rangel's proposal and the 
U.S.-Cuban Friendship Caravan, which will take humanitarian aid 
to Cuba on 12 March. 
  Today's demonstration in Washington is the most advertised 
activity by ultrarightist groups since Havana announced a call 
for a dialogue between the government and representatives of the 
Cuban community abroad to be held on 22, 23, and 24 April. 
  According to Andres Romero, president of the Organization of 
Cuban-Americans for Dignity [Organizacion Cubanos-Americanos por 
la Dignidad], this demonstration is "more or less the same 
thing" and it shows that they "feel as cornered as those who see 
their game is about to end." 
  Romero told PRENSA LATINA that representatives of various 
groups that oppose the blockade also participated in the 
demonstration because if "this is a democratic country, we are 
also entitled to exert our rights." 
  When people of this type use their time to threaten the 
lives 
of 11 million people solely to defend their personal 
interests.... their words, predictions, and threats lose their 
strength. 
  The demonstration by blockade advocates is viewed as an act 
of protest against those who favor an end to economic sanctions, 
including prominent U.S. publications such as THE NEW YORK 
TIMES, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, THE JOURNAL OF COMMERCE, THE 
WASHINGTON POST, and WORLD TRADE magazine. 
  Even former supporters of the blockade have changed their 
minds, as is the case with New Mexico's Democratic 
Representative Bill Richardson, who is a cosponsor of Rangel's 
bill. 
  Former Justice Secretary Ramsey Clark has also challenged 
this policy and has raised the question that if Washington ended 
the commercial embargo against Vietnam, why can it not do the 
same with Cuba, where, as opposed to the former, no U.S. 
citizens have died. 
  However, Warren Christopher, U.S. Secretary of State, 
recently rejected the possibility of a policy change as in the 
case of Vietnam, because, Christopher argued, "Cuba and Vietnam 
constitute two different situations."

<F P=106> [By Jose R. Savall] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 25 Feb (PL) -- Leaders of the American 
Physicians Association (APHA) have endorsed the role of doctors 
in alternative diplomacy against the U.S. blockade against Cuba. 
  Dr. Helen Rodriguez Trias, president of this association 
founded 122 years ago, said the blockade enforced by U.S. 
administrations since the beginning of the 1960's is a dirty and 
inhumane practice. Rodriguez Trias led an APHA delegation that 
attended a bilateral workshop on health exchanges with another 
group of doctors and psychologists who came to Cuba at the 
invitation of the Center of International Policy. 
  The meeting covered the subjects of public health in both 
countries in terms of their current situations and outlook, the 
consequences of the blockade on Cuban medical and sanitary 
conditions, and the program to reform public health services 
presented by President William Clinton. 
  After learning in detail the effects of the blockade on the 
Cuban economy and its negative repercussions on the lives of the 
people, particularly on the lives of children and the elderly, 
the APHA delegation voiced a consensus in its determination to 
increase the campaign against this measure. 
  Rodriguez, of Cuban origin, voiced her pleasure with this 
visit to the island after so many years of absence. Rodriguez 
said: It has been a moving experience, and foremost it has 
reinforced my wishes to continue working to eliminate what the 
U.S. authorities call an embargo against Cuba. 
  When mentioning that the rest of the delegation has the same 
commitment, she added that APHA -- which she described as an 
institution that has always maintained a progressive line in its 
professional and social work -- will organize other contacts 
with Cuban colleagues in the future. 
  Meanwhile, the participation of Wayne Smith and Cuban 
Foreign 
Ministry officials in the workshop gave a touch of alternative 
diplomacy to the meeting. Smith was the chief of the U.S. 
Interests Section in Havana during the Jimmy Carter 
administration. 
  Dr. Abelardo Ramirez, Cuban vice minister of public health, 
said we are mutually learning about the social problems of both 
nations, particularly in the field of health. This field 
represents a common ground among nations and a means for 
personal and collective relations inasmuch as the wellbeing of 
humanity favors the development of all people, he pointed out. 
  Ramirez feels that the presence of these delegations 
constitutes a stimulus for the professionals and workers in 
Cuban public health services who are determined to maintain the 
achievements reached in medical assistance despite the difficult 
times of the national economy. This is an example for other 
sectors of U.S. society, he added, and on our part we are 
committed to improve these meetings which could cover many more 
topics. 
  To this effect, Smith said other visits by professionals to 
Cuba will continue to be organized by the Center of 
International Policy.

  [Text] Havana, 20 Feb (PL) -- Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina praised Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's candidacy 
for the OAS secretary generalship although he warned Cuba cannot 
support any candidate. 
  Robaina expressed the island's position after newsmen 
consulted him on the subject last night, following a three-day 
visit to the central provinces accompanied by more than 40 
members of the diplomatic corps accredited in this capital. 
  The minister said there is no doubt that President Gaviria 
is 
a man who carries out a mandate and fulfills his 
responsibilities, and he is a man with experience who gives 
guarantees and achieves results. 
  However, he made it clear that Cuba "can hardly say who is 
the best or the worst candidate" because it is not a member of 
that organization. 
  I am fully convinced that the members of that organization 
will know how to evaluate who is the best choice for secretary 
general, he stressed. 
  Havana was expelled from the OAS in 1962 due to the great 
pressure exerted by the United States to isolate from the rest 
of the continent. [sentence as received]

  [Text] Havana, 22 Feb (PL) -- Ukraine views with optimism 
and hope the future of its ties with Cuba, based on equality of 
rights and mutual respect, scientific-technical development, and 
cooperation, Ukraine Vice Foreign Minister Yuriy O. Ryslash said 
today. 
  Kiev maintains relations with 132 states and has 44 
diplomatic missions, Ryslash pointed out when opening the first 
Ukrainian Embassy in Latin America. 
  Present at the ceremony, among others, were: Ricardo Alarcon 
de Quesada, president of the Cuban parliament; Lionel Soto, vice 
president of the Council of State; and Isabel Allende Karam, 
vice foreign minister. 
  In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Alarcon emphasized the 
significance of the event as this is the first Ukrainian 
diplomatic office in Latin America. 
  The Ukrainian flag was raised over a building located in the 
Miramar area, in western Havana, while a memorandum of bilateral 
cooperation in various fields was being signed at the same time. 
  The document, signed by the mayors of Havana and Kiev, Pedro 
Chavez and Leonid G. Kosakivskiy, contributes to strengthening 
the ties between the two important cities and calls for the 
development of economic relations. 
  Kiev, with a population of some 3 million, wants to obtain 
pharmaceuticals in exchange for food and other merchandise, said 
city Deputy Mayor Aleksandr Taranenko, who thanked the Cuban 
Government for the medical assistance given to the 12,000 
children of his country affected by the nuclear accident at 
Chernobyl. 
  The signed document represents one more step in the 
improvement of ties between the two states, said Mayor 
Kosakivskiy moments before attending a meeting with Sergio 
Corrieri, president of the Cuban Friendship With the Peoples 
Institute (ICAP). 
  The Ukrainian delegation led by Vice Foreign Minister 
Ryslash 
arrived in this city on Sunday and will return home next Friday.

<F P=106> [Report by Raimundo Lopez] </F>
  [Text] Manicaragua, Cuba, 18 Feb (PL) -- A high-ranking 
officer of the Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR) in the central 
region of the island stated today that the Cuban military 
industry guarantees the country's essential defense needs. 
  Brigadier General Luis Perez Rospide, commandant of the FAR 
Military Industry, said that despite the economic difficulties 
facing the nation this sector is in a position to satisfy Cuba's 
basic defense needs. 
  Perez Rospide gave the members of the diplomatic corps 
credited in Havana a detailed explanation of the FAR's 
industrial activities. The members of the diplomatic corps are 
on a three-day tour of the country's central region. 
  These supplies, he said, include specifically projectiles, 
personnel and antitank mines, grenades, light rifles, and other 
material. 
  More than 40 ambassadors and other diplomatic officials 
visited the industry's "Commander Ernesto Che Guevara" 
facilities. The facility is located on a mountain range in the 
central province of Villa Clara, some 300 km east of the Cuban 
capital. 
  Answering questions by the foreign officials, the officer 
indicated that Cuban defense readiness was being maintained 
despite the economic crossroads the country is experiencing and 
since the abrupt loss of its main commercial partners within the 
former Socialist Bloc of Eastern Europe. 
  In response to the foreign diplomats and journalists, he 
said: "I assure you that we can produce sufficient amounts of 
ammunition to defeat any enemy no matter how powerful." 
  For the first time since its creation in 1962, the FAR 
opened 
these installations to foreign visitors. According to 
appearances, PRENSA LATINA observed that the visitors enjoyed 
total freedom to enquire about the available production capacity. 
  One detail that caught the diplomats' attention was the 
small 
amount of Soviet-made machinery, although the former USSR was 
practically Cuba's only weapons supplier. The majority of the 
equipment there is Italian, German, or Spanish. 
  When asked about this, Russian Ambassador Arnold Kalinin 
said 
that there is currently very little military collaboration 
between the two nations. 
  He told PRENSA LATINA: "there are still a few specialists on 
the island, but they are working mainly on weapons and machinery 
maintenance." 
  Gen. Perez Rospide explained that to date ties between the 
Cuban military industry and its former allies in the former USSR 
are nonexistent. He emphasized "we have no need for them right 
now." 
  The ingenuity and initiative of hundreds of workers and 
specialists, civilian and military alike, have kept our 
techniques in top condition, the Cuban soldier said. 
  Colonel Eladio Fernandez, director of the Manicaragua 
military industrial site, said that 1992 was the industry's 
toughest year. Last year, though, the sector began to recover. 
  Specifically, he said, many of the industry's facilities 
have 
been put to work to meet the needs of the people or other local 
industries such as tourism and even foreign investors. 
  We are also open to foreign capital, Gen. Perez Rospide 
said, 
mostly for civilian production projects. 
  He explained that the military factories, for example, use 
part of their facilities to produce scales, refrigeration 
equipment, and other local tourism industry needs. 
  Perez Rospide added that officials are studying the 
possibility of beginning a joint enterprise using foreign 
investment. He said he would prefer not to disclose any details 
due to the current stage of the negotiations process. 
  Diplomats credited in Havana, along with members of the 
foreign press, are on the second day of their three-day visit to 
the country's central region. 
  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina told PRENSA LATINA 
that these tours are geared toward making foreign 
representatives aware of the true situation of the country and 
people, who he called the true designers of Cuba's foreign 
policy.

  [Text] Havana, 17 Feb (PL) -- Six months after the Cuban 
State Council enacted Decree 141, which permits self-employment, 
a total of 141,637 Cubans are self-employed in the country, it 
was officially reported today. 
  Alfredo Diaz Urbay, director of the Labor Research 
Institute, 
told PRENSA LATINA that by January the State Committee for Labor 
and Social Security [CETSS] had received 156,828 applications 
for permission to do this type of work. According to the decree, 
in force since the second half of 1993, 136 forms of 
self-employment are allowed, he said. 
  Diaz Urbay also said that over 70 percent of the authorized 
persons practice less than 20 percent of the activities 
permitted, particularly the following: craftsmen, coachmen, 
carpenters, barbers, handcart drivers, and manicurists. He said 
that 76.9 percent of the permits have been issued to males. Of 
those receiving permits 35.5 percent work, 27 percent are 
retired, 19.7 are jobless, and 16.7 percent are housewives. 
  According to the document, the regulations are established 
by 
two state committees -- labor and social security, and finance. 
The former issues the permit for self-employment and the latter 
collects, because these persons must pay for their permits, thus 
helping bolster the state's treasury. 
  State finance committee sources have reported that Cuban 
authorities are studying the implementation of a general tax 
system which, if approved, would include the self-employed. 
  The production of various crafts, which makes it possible 
for 
the Cuban population to buy minor articles, particularly for 
domestic and decorative purposes, has been observed to increase 
since the State Council decree was enacted. 
  The current conditions of the so-called special period in 
time of peace, a stage of serious economic crisis after the 
collapse of the socialist bloc and the Soviet Union, Cuba's main 
commercial partners, and the aggravation of the U.S. embargo 
determined the need to expand the opportunities for 
self-employment.

  [Text] Mexico City, 26 Feb (PL) -- Hector Rosada, 
coordinator of the Guatemalan Government Peace Commission, 
disclosed today that the new date for the resumption of 
negotiations in Guatemala resulted from a government-guerrilla 
agreement with the United Nations. 
  Rosada explained to PRENSA LATINA by telephone from 
Guatemala 
City that UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's suggested 
dates of 3 through 7 March for a round of talks in Mexico City 
was discussed with both sides. 
  Meanwhile, the political-diplomatic representatives of the 
insurgent Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) said 
the guerrillas would not agree to hold the round of talks after 
28 February. 
  "In the presence of the United Nations we agreed with the 
government delegation during a meeting in Mexico on 10 January 
that we would formally resume the talks during the second half 
of February. For the URNG there is no other date," explained 
Luis Becker, a diplomat for the guerrillas. 
  Nevertheless, Joe Sills, a UN spokesman, explained that the 
summons to a meeting presented by the United Nations to the URNG 
"came after negotiators from both sides were consulted." 
  Meanwhile, Rosada said that the government always considered 
it counterproductive for the formal resumption of the talks 
(after nine months at a standstill) to coincide with the UN 
Human Rights Commission talks under way in Geneva. 
  National and international humanitarian organizations 
attending the meeting in Switzerland are seeking formal 
condemnation against Guatemala for its alleged abuses against 
citizen freedoms. 
  To this end, Rosada admitted that during the next 
Government-URNG round of talks an effort will be made to achieve 
a consensus on citizen prerogatives and a schedule to discuss 
other pending issues. 
  Among the latter are the creation of a commission to 
investigate human rights violations, establishment of a 
cease-fire schedule, and discussion on disarmament and 
demilitarization. 
  Although the Guatemalan Government and guerrillas held a 
preliminary meeting in Mexico City between 6 and 10 January, 
they have not held an official meeting since 8 May 1993, when 
the talks in Mexico City fell through without any agreements.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Coordinating Committee of Sandinists for the </F>
National Project] 
  [Text] The holding of the FSLN [Sandinist National 
Liberation Front] Congress scheduled for May 1994 has given rise 
to a major controversy within the party that has unfortunately 
prompted one of the opposing factions to resort to unfounded 
accusations and reprehensible epithets. This in turn has 
generated great tensions that endanger the necessary unity of 
Sandinists, tensions that could clearly lead to a breakup having 
disastrous consequences for members, the party, and the country. 
Such a rupture would only reaffirm the current party chiefs' 
inability to exercise leadership strong enough to unite members 
despite their diversity, a revolutionary trait. It would lead 
the FSLN into the same situation in which all parties that have 
existed throughout our political history have found themselves 
and with the same faults and ills. 
  The course of internal discussion alarms us as a faction, 
just as it alarms all Sandinists. Two phenomena that both 
support and complement one another lie at the root of these 
confrontations: 
  1--First of all, bossism has gradually taken root in 
Sandinism, replacing the old collective leadership and 
attempting to deny any new leadership. This is antidemocratic by 
definition and in no way able to support necessary changes 
within the party, particularly those having to do with the 
deepening of party democracy. 
  2--In addition, one faction within Sandinism opposes 
renewal, 
deems violent methods valid, defended "the ticket" at the First 
Congress, continues to support democratic centralism--however 
obsolete--and provides the fundamental mainstay of bossism. 
Discredit and exclusion have been the favorite methods of such 
comrades, and anyone who does not think as they do is considered 
a traitor to the Sandinist cause. 
  The latest verbal attacks from members of the faction are 
aimed precisely at vetoing any renewal of the party and the 
alternative of a new party and national leadership. The approach 
constitutes an attack on the necessary unity of Sandinism, which 
depends upon the following: 
  1) that personal aspirations within the party are valid for 
all members, not just part of them; 
  2) that bossism has been extremely detrimental throughout 
the 
history of Nicaragua, for which reason we must banish it from 
the FSLN; 
  3) that diversity of Sandinist thought is the basis of its 
revolutionary principles; and 
  4) that transparent, high-minded methods are absolutely 
necessary and irreplaceable. 
  We Sandinists for the National Program reaffirm once more 
our 
commitment to renewal and the democratization of the FSLN. 
Consequently, we clearly condemn the verbal attacks launched 
against the Sandinist bench and Dr. Sergio Ramirez. We are 
issuing an urgent appeal to maintain debate within the confines 
of decency, on a high plain, and with respect for personal 
dignity and ideas.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ernesto Castillo: "Who Is Accelerating the </F>
Deterioration of the FSLN?"] 
  [Text] Is it possible that for some Sandinists the loss of 
power means the loss of values? When one reviews the attitude of 
devotion, sacrifice, and rectitude of many comrades, it is very 
difficult for us to understand their egotism. It translates into 
a desperation to retain the leading role and preserve privileges 
on the part of the very persons who, by virtue of the very 
responsibilities they exercise within the party, should be an 
example for those who still believe that the FSLN is the last 
hope for achieving a more just society. 
  The FSLN of today cannot be the same as it was in past 
decades. Trying to turn it into a docile, blind instrument 
prevents its adaptation to the dynamic times in which we are 
living. To cling to positions of power and use improper methods 
of struggle, methods at odds with honesty, is not proper 
revolutionary practice. 
  From 1990 on, we have sadly observed an accelerated process 
of deterioration within our ranks. Sound debate of ideological 
principles and methods of struggle has been replaced by 
irrational, willful imposition. We have been incapable of giving 
its rightful place to a Sandinist Assembly that must be provided 
with the proper instruments rather than strengthened as the 
maximum authority between congresses. 
  Nor is it the right, the social democrats, radicals, or 
moderates who must take the blame for the moral deterioration of 
the party. Rather, it is the elements that stand in the way of 
the search for solutions, believing that the party serves them, 
who are responsible. 
  The method chosen in the attempt to discredit Sergio or any 
other Sandinist is sad and condemnable. Nor must one be deceived 
by the argument that (given his personality) one is merely 
dealing with an outburst by Carlos Guadamuz. With his 
personality and the radio, Guadamuz responds to partisan 
interests rather than the interests of the FSLN. These methods 
of struggle do more harm to those who promote them than to the 
individual they target. 
  It is not by submissively and unthinkingly adhering to the 
will of a leader, whoever he may be, that we shall help maintain 
unity and define a political program that will bind us together 
and move us forward. 
  To my way of thinking, Sergio made a terrible mistake by 
accepting the post in the the National Leadership. At that first 
Congress, he should have realized that the ticket would be 
imposed and that as a result, the decision of majority of the 
members of the National Leadership to cling to posts and 
positions would drag him into an internal struggle (new for him) 
rather than participation in a collective leadership. I also 
believe it was a mistake to respond to the radio attacks. The 
language, content, and their authors discredit them and render 
them unworthy of any response.

  [Text] Commander Bayardo Arce, member of the National 
Directorate of the Sandinist National Liberation Front, FSLN, 
met with Cuban President Fidel Castro during an exchange tour in 
Cuba that began Monday and ended Wednesday in Havana. Upon 
returning from Cuba, Arce voiced his concern that while the 
government celebrates the fourth anniversary of its electoral 
victory, it has not yet appointed an ambassador to Cuba. 
  There are thousands of Nicaraguan students in Cuba, health 
cooperation agreements are maintained, and many people travel to 
that country to receive medical treatment for exceptional health 
problems. 
  He stressed that Cuba renegotiated its debt with Nicaragua, 
reducing it to almost symbolic levels, and that those 
obligations have not even been honored by the Nicaraguan 
Government. 
  In addition to meeting with Fidel Castro, Arce met with 
other 
government leaders and members of the Communist Party of Cuba, 
including Carlos Lage, vice president of the Council of State; 
Osmany Cienfuegos, member of the PCC [Communist Party of Cuba] 
Politburo; Pedro Arbizu [name as published], director of the 
America Department; Foreign Trade Minister Carlos Cabrizas [name 
as published]; and Hector Rodriguez, president of the National 
Bank of Cuba. As for the subjects discussed, Arce said that he 
reviewed with the Cuban leaders aspects related to the Cuban 
economic opening and Nicaragua's domestic situation, 
particularly the Sandinist process and the party's upcoming 
special congress.

<F P=106> [Report by Arquimedes Gonzalez] </F>
  [Text] On the third day of the hearing on the homicide of 
Jean Paul Genie, which occurred in October 1990, military 
prosecutor Lester Gallo Sandoval on 23 February ordered the 
provisional arrest of two more bodyguards of General Humberto 
Ortega, chief of the Sandinist People's Army, EPS. This makes a 
total of six bodyguards who have been interrogated and placed 
under provisional arrest. 
  Bodyguards Jose Marino Medina Alvarez and Arnoldo Enrique 
Morales Montes were interrogated on the morning of 23 February, 
after which they were notified of their provisional arrests and 
then transferred to La Granja on km 14 of the road to Masaya. 
  Coinciding with previous depositions given by four 
bodyguards, both Medina and Morales said that on 28 October 1990 
at approximately 1400 they left Las Colinas in a Renegado jeep 
and two white Toyota Cressidas and went to the General Command, 
returning to Military Complex 003 located at Gen. Ortega's 
residence at approximately 1800. 
<H5>  Nothing Abnormal on the Day of the Incident </H5>
  Marino Medina said the EPS chief's caravan uses a silver 
Renegado jeep and that the day of the incident everything was 
normal when they left: "There was nothing abnormal." In 
answering a question from the prosecutor, Medina said that the 
bodyguards "only fire if they are attacked first. We have never 
fired at a suspect," he stressed. 
  Meanwhile, Morales Montes did not provide any new 
information 
and only reiterated what the other five bodyguards who were 
interrogated before him had said. 
  Mario Barahona Portocarrero, the defense lawyer for four of 
the bodyguards, said on 23 February that the arrest warrant 
issued for the bodyguards contained "serious flaws." For 
instance, "we have not yet seen a witness who can identify them 
or truly prove their participation in the action." 
  Prosecutor Daniel Olivas, however, claims he has "the 
necessary evidence" to prove the bodyguards are guilty. "The 
empty cartridges belong to their rifles, and there was a Bengal 
light which is only used by them," he stressed. Olivas said that 
the bodyguards' weapons were not confiscated immediately after 
the crime but several days later, and "now the rifles have 
disappeared," which could mean that they were intentionally 
hidden. 
  In that regard, Barahona said that investigations 
"established that the empty cartridges were from AK rifles, but 
the report never said that the shots were fired by Gen. Ortega's 
bodyguards." 
<H5>  The Rifles Were Not Fired </H5>
  "The rifles were never fired," Barahona said, adding that 
"the forensic experts did not find traces of gunpowder in the 
bodyguard's rifles." Barahona gave little importance to the 
investigation conducted by a Venezuelan mission in 1990, 
"because from the beginning they started accusing Gen. Ortega's 
bodyguards without considering other possibilities. They did 
not come here to investigate but to accuse," he noted. 
  Military Prosecutor Lester Gallo Sandoval said that no 
further actions have been scheduled since the two bodyguards' 
depositions because no requests have been received from the 
plaintiff's side. He added that it is possible that the case 
could be resolved in the next 10 days, when he should have 
enough material to reach the necessary conclusions. He added 
that he will summon all the witnesses in order to have more 
evidence to work with when passing judgment. 
  At the end of the hearing Raymond Genie insisted on 
disqualifying the military court and the Supreme Court of 
Justice's decision to transfer the case to that court. In a 
document presented at noon on 23 February, Genie referred to the 
sentence issued on 31 January 1993 by Judge Boanerges Ojeda 
ordering the "provisional arrest of the soldier or soldiers 
implicated in the case" and in which Gen. Ortega and Captains 
Jose Orozco Pavon and Lorenzo Martin Romero Betanco were 
mentioned as "concealers." Based on that sentence Genie 
requested that provisional arrest warrants be issued for the 
presumed "concealers" Judge Ojeda mentioned in his sentence.

<F P=106> [From the "Extravision" newscast; passages within quotation </F>
marks recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Deputy Doris Tijerino said today the 
U.S. Embassy does not want the National Assembly plenum to pass 
the antidrug law, because it does not include the DEA's 
collaboration with the National Police on drug control. 
  The police and National Assembly commission that prepared 
the 
draft bill on narcotics, psychotropic substances and so forth 
still disagree on certain controversial issues such as whether 
the DEA should participate in Nicaraguan drug-trafficking 
investigations. Tijerino says the antidrug law should be 
educational instead of repressive. 
  [Tijerino] "Excessive pressure has been exerted on the 
commission to make the law repressive. My concern is it may 
repress our youths, a point that is obvious from the disregard 
that has been shown for the need to allow the Nicaraguan Youth 
Council to work with the National Council." 
  [Announcer] Commander Leonel Espinoza, of the National 
Police 
Narcotics Department, has said the following: 
  [Espinoza] "Every law contains repressive elements, but this 
law also calls for a national council that will design a plan 
that will also address general preventive issues such as 
education, children, and youths; in other words, the law 
contemplates the preventive side of the struggle against drug 
related crimes, not only the coercive side of it." 
  [Announcer] Deputy Tijerino says the U.S. Embassy did not 
want the plenum to pass the law. 
  [Unidentified reporter] "Who has come under pressure and 
what 
type? 
  [Tijerino] "I have met with David Noble, and I was informed 
that before the draft bill was sent to the plenum for discussion 
it was delivered to the U.S. Embassy so that the embassy could 
say whether it adhered to international agreements. Mr. Noble 
asked me, diplomatically, of course, if I would agree to a 
withdrawal of the law from debate. This means U.S. Embassy 
officials oppose the law, because it does not guarantee 
unrestricted activities by organizations such as the DEA, which 
promotes police operations against drug trafficking." 
  [Announcer] Meanwhile, Commander Espinosa has said the 
following: 
  [Espinosa] "I have said openly we will cooperate with every 
police force in the world. We believe certain police 
organizations have more experience in the struggle against drug 
trafficking and more vested interests as well, but such 
cooperation is totally fair and normal." 
  [Announcer] The antidrug law had been stored away for over 
two years, and during the second session of debates progress was 
made only on Article Five, which was discussed today for more 
than three hours. The law will continue to be discussed at the 
National Assembly, and its approval is expected within several 
weeks.

  [Text] Five citizens who were accused of plotting to 
assassinate Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo have been charged 
with attempted murder and association with criminal intent. 
  Lacayo appears on the legal document as the only plaintiff 
in 
the case opened on 19 February, when Matagalpa police arrested a 
"mechanic" identified as German Saenz Perez, a native of 
Matiguas. 
  Saenz appeared before the judge of the Matagalpa District 
First Court, but when police realized the magnitude of his 
statement, they took Saenz to the Managua Fifth Criminal 
District Court, presided over by Martha Quezada. 
  Matagalpa authorities have not established if Saenz is 
connected to any other crime. They added Saenz told them he was 
one of the individuals who held a "meeting" with "certain 
prominent figures." 
  The "prominent figures" to whom Saenz referred included no 
less than Deputy Humberto Castilla, a man named Aristides, and a 
mayor of an undisclosed location in northern Nicaragua. 
  According to Saenz, also known as "Tuti," the meeting was 
held in San Jose de los Remates. He added many more meetings, 
which were attended by recontra leader "Charrito," followed. 
  The main objective of these meetings was to devise the 
perfect plan to assassinate Lacayo. 
  In addition to Saenz, Doris Isabel Lopez Morraz, Manuel 
Salvador Lopez Morraz, Francisco Javier Rivera Picado, and Luis 
Izaguirre Guevara are being tried. 
  The trial still lacks a writ of inquiry by the plaintiff, in 
this case, but it has an exhaustive chronology by Saenz, the 
main defendant, regarding his first "casual" encounter with the 
mentioned prominent individuals. 
  According to Saenz, he met his presumed "employers" for the 
first time when he was walking down a road in Matiguas and was 
approached by several men in a luxury vehicle. The men, 
including those already mentioned, then asked him for directions 
to get to San Jose de los Remates. 
  Preliminary investigations indicate Saenz has links with 
members of the former resistance movement and that he is living 
with a woman whose relatives died during the war. 
  Reliable sources have disclosed Castilla mentioned the 
subject in private at the National Assembly, referring to Saenz 
as his "former driver," whom he had fired because Saenz 
allegedly offered drugs to his son. 
  Castilla has also downplayed Saenz' version and denied all 
accusations the defendants might make against him during the 
process.

  [Text] The Sandinist People's Army [EPS] will continue 
offensive actions against groups of rearmed individuals who have 
not accepted the demobilization of the 3-80 Northern Front, 
including the groups led by "Charro" and "Northiel" [Roberto 
Garcia Castro], EPS spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jaime Wheelock 
has said. 
  "Charro" and "Northiel" will be fought in spite of the 
efforts by Jose Angel Talavera, alias Commander "Chacal," to 
gather the troops of these two rebel chieftains and demobilize 
them together with the 3-80 Northern Front. The EPS confirmed 
yesterday that "Charro" and "Northiel" refused to attend a 
meeting between the government and the 3-80 Northern Front in 
Caulatu, Quilali, where both parties signed an agreement that 
will bring peace in northern Nicaragua. 
  Charro's troops two days ago attacked the town of Mulukuku, 
where the police had to flee when they could not fight them. 
According to police sources, there were only five law 
enforcement officers in this town. Mulukuku was attacked a 
second time by the recontras under the command of "Aguila 
Negra," "Arandu," and "Alacran," all of them subordinates of 
"Charro." In the first attack in February 1993, three policemen 
were murdered. 
  According to journalist Aurora Leyton Morales -- our 
correspondent in Matagalpa -- the 19-year old Daniel Ochoa 
Castro was killed in this attack when the rearmed men tried to 
kidnap him. The following persons who had demobilized from the 
Nicaraguan Resistance received bullet wounds: Rosario Suarez 
Guido, 24; Miguel Angel Fernandez, 30; Justo Ortiz, 27; and 
Gregorio Sanchez, 44. Charro's troops also looted some shops, 
bars, and restaurants. 
  "The peace agreement exclusively protects the 3-80 Northern 
Front. "Charro" and "Northiel" do not belong to that group; 
they form part of another organization that has mixed political 
and criminal connotations, Lt. Col. Wheelock pointed out. 
"Nonetheless, the political banners being waged by `Charro' and 
`Northiel' are disregarded because they refuse to demobilize. 
They will be fought by the Army, just like it fights criminal 
bands," Wheelock emphasized. 
  Wheelock also referred the agreements signed yesterday in 
Caulatu. After making a summary of the same, he reported that 
the EPS yesterday sent food for 400 men, and that the Health 
Ministry sent a medical brigade to treat the wounded from the 
3-80 Northern Front. That is all part of the agreements signed 
yesterday at Caulatu. He added that the EPS, CIAV-OAS 
[International Commission of Support and Verification-OAS], and 
the rebel group will keep in contact and will coordinate actions 
to prevent any incidents in the future, and that "when we have 
to enter the enclave, they will be informed first." 
  He confirmed that the 3-80 Northern Front will demobilize in 
three stages, beginning on 2 March when 100 men disarm. The 
second stage will begin on 16 March, when 50 percent of those 
remaining will demobilize, while on 8 April, the rest of the 
fighters and the Council of Commanders of the 3-80 Northern 
Front led by "Chacal" will rejoin civilian life.

<F P=106> [From the "Hidden Truths" column by Tomas Cabal: "Questions </F>
Arise Regarding Origin of Perez Balladares' Fortune"] 
  [Text] PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] candidate 
Ernesto Perez Balladares up until now has evaded serious 
questioning regarding the origin of his vast fortune. 
Protecting himself under the so-called Santa Maria Agreement 
[Pacto de Santa Maria] and a strategy designed by his advisers, 
"Toro" [Perez Balladares] has avoided all forums in which his 
performance as a government official could be scrutinized by 
people who know the inside of the mistakenly labelled 
"revolutionary process." 
  Recently, the PRD candidate refused to accept an invitation 
from the daily LA PRENSA by arguing that media was not 
"impartial." Sources close to the candidate point out that 
"Toro" knows his role as a minister and a government official of 
the military will not stand up to serious analysis or 
questioning. Other sources who know the details of the vast 
fortune controlled by Perez Balladares appear surprised that the 
other candidates have not even bothered to question the origin 
of the PRD candidate's assets and riches. 
  Former officials of the military regime indicate that the 
funds to install the television station controlled by Perez 
Balladares and his associates were supplied on direct orders 
from Omar Torrijos. Upon Torrijos' death, the balance of the 
funds required for the station to operate was handed over by 
Panama Defense Forces [PDF] staff members, according to the 
source. Meanwhile, Perez Balladares and his running mates have 
been effective in criticizing the current government's 
inefficiency and corruption. 
  With Guillermo Endara in the Presidency surrounded by a 
number of individuals who profited under the umbrella of the 
military garrisons, the PRD campaign has been relatively easy. 
No one can deny that this government has been a complete 
failure. This fact, together with the Torrijist myth that 
"everything was better" in the past, facilitates "Toro" and his 
followers' election propaganda. 
  We are certain that the Panamanian people have not forgotten 
the dictatorship's excesses. Nevertheless, it is also obvious 
that many lower income Panamanians long for the times of "cash 
favors and petty gains" [salve y rebuscas]. PRD members have 
been effective in presenting the military government as a period 
of economic bonanza where everyone had hopes of "meeting the 
family's basic needs." 
  For a people battered by hunger, malnutrition, unemployment, 
insecurity, and poverty, this is a powerful message being 
successfully exploited by the PRD. The PRD has conveniently 
forgotten the $962-million loss at the National Bank; the 
world's largest per-capita foreign debt; and the embezzlements 
in the Social Security Fund, the National Savings Bank, and 
other state institutions. 
  The PRD, its founders, and representatives were accomplices 
of robbery and theft. Mr. Perez Balladares, as well as many of 
his followers, cannot explain the origins of their fortunes. 
  "Toro" and his running mates are all members of a "native 
aristocracy" that did not hesitate to surrender and sell out to 
the military. Perez Balladares and the other "hand picked" 
officials who worked for the military have no right to talk 
about or criticize the democratic government's inefficiency. 
They and the majority of their followers profited from and 
exploited the Panamanian people during 21 years of military 
dictatorship. 
  With Noriega in jail and Torrijos in hell, it is easy for 
PRD 
members to sidestep the truth by not replying to awkward 
questions related to their political and business activities. 
These activities must be brought into the open during this 
political campaign. 
  The thefts and arrogance that characterized the PRD 
administration will be repeated if they gain power again. It is 
then time to question in detail Mr. Perez Balladares on the 
origin of his vast fortune. The questioning should take place 
in public forums and through campaign propaganda to determine 
whether he can respond and convince the voters that he has made 
his fortune through honest work. 
  It is said that the people choose the leaders they deserve. 
If we accept the results of the latest polls, it appears we are 
going downhill, repeating the errors of the past by electing 
pirates and privateers whose sole goal is "Everything for our 
own personal gain," ["Todo por la papa," play on words on the 
former PDF slogan "Todo por la patria" -- "Everything for the 
fatherland."]

  [Text] Santiago del Estero (DYN-NA) -- Workers in this 
provincial capital yesterday staged a protest march in demand of 
wage hikes and to complain about reductions in their salaries. 
The 500 workers also continued to collect signatures for a 
petition rejecting an adjustment bill, to be presented to 
trustee Juan Schiaretti on 20 March, that sparked violent riots 
here late last year. Union sources said that teachers were 
upset about differences in salaries paid to staff doing the same 
job. The sources added that there is no salary scale to go by 
in the province for teachers and other state workers. Teachers 
unions also said that the 20 percent bonus paid to teachers with 
more than 20 years on the job had been cancelled by the 
government here.

  [Text] Posadas (DYN) -- Local farmers, upset by the low 
returns that they receive for their crops and pressure from the 
tax man, staged rowdy protests yesterday. From early morning 
farmers cut national Highway 12 near the town of Capiovy, some 
130 kilometres from Posadas, on the road which links Misiones 
Province with the Brazilian border. The farmers, mostly yerba 
mate growers, are classed by the DGI Tax Bureau as being 
self-employed and are being pressed to pay pension arrears for 
the past 10 years. The poor farmers say that they have been 
severely hurt by the tax demands. The protesters, who had camped 
by the roadside, stooped traffic until a judge ordered the 
Border Guards to remove them. Three people were arrested and 
will be appearing in court on Tuesday. The farmers are 
demanding a fixed rather than market price for their crops.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Argentina through 24 February: 
  Finance Secretary Ricardo Gutierrez reported that the 
nonfinancial public sector, excluding privatizations, registered 
a 5.121 billion pesos primary surplus in 1993, "the highest 
level ever in Argentine economic history." This was based on 
revenues of 44.756 billion pesos and expenses of 40.197 billion 
pesos and additional resources. (Buenos Aires LA PRENSA in 
Spanish 19 Feb 94 p 5) 
  A Foreign Ministry press communique reports that the 
Argentine Government has issued a bond series of $350 million 
Euro-Titles with a one-year maturity. These securities, which 
will be sold in international markets, will not be registered 
under U.S. laws and cannot be offered or sold in the United 
States. (Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 2250 GMT 24

  [Text] La Paz, 27 Feb (EFE) -- Spaniard Manuel Ramon Puchol 
did not die of a drug overdose: He was beaten to death by some 
military men in the Bolivian town of San Matias, according to a 
report by the office of the police chief of that Amazon town, as 
reported by Radio Panamericana and by ANF [Fides News Agency]. 
  Same sources added that Captain Rodomiro Rada, the San 
Matias 
Police chief, informed Santa Cruz department Police Commander 
Armando Morin Sanchez today that Puchol died on the evening of 
10 February at the Monte Florida 14th Infantry barracks, 
following a beating by a group of military men. 
  Radio Panamericana of La Paz reported that Army Lieutenant 
Marco Antonio Mejia Alarcon is responsible for Puchol's death. 
  The San Matias Police report states that British subject 
Douglas James Morrison and some San Matias residents saw Mejia 
Alarcon brutally beating Puchol on the evening of 10 February. 
  After declaring that he witnessed the brutal beating of 
Puchol by Mejia Alarcon and other military men, Morrison left 
San Matias last Thursday, sought protection at the British and 
Spanish embassies in La Paz, and his whereabouts are unknown. 
  Despite the statement by Morrison, Interior Minister German 
Quiroga, Police Commander General Luis Rocha, and General 
Reynaldo Caceres -- the Army commander in chief -- emphasized 
last Friday that there was no evidence that San Matias military 
men had beaten Puchol, and that he died of a cocaine overdose. 
  Puchol, 33, was a Spanish Justice Ministry official who 
arrived on 10 February in San Matias, in the Bolivian department 
of Santa Cruz, which borders Brazil. A few days earlier, he 
made a study of the Xingu Indian tribe in the Brazilian region 
of Mato Grosso. 
  Interior Ministry sources informed EFE on 16 February that 
early on 11 February, Bolivian military men left Puchol's dead 
body at a San Matias hospital, explaining that they found it in 
a vehicle abandoned in a jungle zone.

  [Text] La Paz, 25 Feb (EFE) -- Bolivian Foreign Minister 
Antonio Aranibar today said that the violent death of Spanish

"investigate the real cause" of the death of Puchol, who died on 
10 February in San Matias, Bolivia.

Foreign 
Minister Javier Solana "to whom I expressed our regrets and 
guaranteed the Bolivian Government's political will to clarify 
this murder."

<F P=106> [Report by Ricardo Diaz from Sucre] </F>
  [Text] The strong party structure of the Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left, MIR, and of the Nationalist Democratic 
Action, ADN, is silently crumbling as a result of the withdrawal 
of several of their members. The crisis became more acute 
following the dissemination of charges about alleged links 
between high- ranking MIR leaders -- including [former Bolivian 
President] Jaime Paz Zamora -- with drug traffickers. MIR and 
ADN congressmen have been observed to maintain a discreet 
silence over the issue, thus causing the two parties 
middle-ranking leaders' to leave the parties files. 
  ADN leader Gaston Encina, who was previously one of the main 
MIR defenders, does not want to comment on the issue and is 
withdrawing from the political scenario. The public, however, 
would like to hear his opinion because it is known that he also 
participated in the meetings with drug traffickers, as the 
charges state. 
  The crisis is affecting not only former President Jaime Paz 
Zamora's party; it has also stained Mr. Hugo Banzer Suarez' 
party. In the last few hours, the withdrawal of several ADN 
members and middle-ranking leaders has been reported. Among the 
withdrawing ADN members is Jorge Landivar Rua, a former 
Chuquisaca Department ADN governor. He said: We have been 
fighting corruption and are now indignant that trafficking may 
have permeated the national structure of our political parties. 
I bluntly repudiate the situation because these links, 
particularly MIR links, with drug trafficking are twofold 
corrupt, Landivar said. 
  The MIR and ADN crisis is becoming more acute.

  [Text] As was said a few minutes ago, the leaders of the 
Movement of the Revolutionary Left, the MIR, have placed 
themselves at the disposal of the Chamber of Deputies 
Constitution Committee to be investigated. 
  A FIDES news agency cable refers to a particular case: 
Through a note handed to the Chamber of Deputies president, 
former Interior Minister Guillermo Capobianco, who is a member 
of the MIR, has placed himself at the disposal of the Chamber of 
Deputies Justice Committee. Drug traffickers questioned during 
investigations conducted by the Judicial Police have made the 
serious charge of Capobianco having links with drug traffickers. 
Capobianco today appeared before the Constitution Committee to 
deliver the aforementioned note. On the occasion, he said that 
in the note addressed to Constitution Committee President (?Luis 
Sandoval Moron), he ratifies his decision to request that the 
Committee members begin the investigation. Capobianco declined 
to make a statement on his party's behalf. He only said that 
for three years he has been wanting to be heard by a 
constitutional institution.

  [Text] The Bolivian Labor Federation, COB, holds the 
government responsible for the clashes that occurred early on 
the morning of 26 February at Chapare, Cochabamba Department. 
  Nearly 15,000 Chapare coca growers staged a demonstration on 
25 February, rejecting the compulsory eradication of their 
plantations. This demonstration, which in the opinion of COB 
Executive Secretary Oscar Salas was entirely legal, brought to 
the region Mobile Rural Patrol Unit, Umopar, agents who occupied 
the site. A clash was the result early on the morning of 26 
February. 
  [Begin Salas recording] Blood was shed during the violent 
repression, and 18 fellow coca growers were injured. [end 
recording] 
  While the COB asserts that 18 people were injured, some with 
buckshot, the government reports that only three people were 
injured: two of them coca growers and the third an Umopar 
officer. The COB also asserts that 78 people had been arrested, 
although they have now been released. The government, however, 
asserts that only 60 people were arrested. 
  Despite the reigning tense calm, an agreement has been 
reached with the government by which the coca growers ask not to 
be confused with drug traffickers. 
  [Begin Salas recording] Their repressed fury was against the 
coca growers instead of against drug traffickers. The other 
point is that there must be an equivalence, that coca must be 
replaced by other products. [end recording] 
  Salas categorically pointed out that no one can force 
growers 
to eradicate their coca plantations because the alternative 
development programs are not being implemented. If the 
government forces this measure, it would be removing their 
livelihood. 
  It must also be said that the coca growers are unaware of 
the 
contents of the few alternative development programs, which 
still remain on paper.

  [Text] La Paz, 24 Feb (EFE) -- Bolivian Labor Federation 
(COB) Executive Secretary Oscar Salas today began a "dry" hunger 
strike (without liquids) in response to the government rejection 
of a list of petitions presented by the COB 44 days ago. 
  Salas and several other COB leaders who joined the hunger 
strike are trying to promote labor mobilizations which somehow 
have lost the workers appeal, thus reflecting the labor 
movement's weakness. 
  The administration of President Sanchez de Lozada rejected 
the economic and social petitions of the COB, which demands a 
minimum salary of 1,360 bolivianos (about $300 per month) 
instead of the current 135 bolivianos ($30) and ratified its 
decision to increase salaries by 7.5 percent. 
  The government reply to the 30-point list of petitions did 
not leave the COB any alternative but to resort to pressure with 
"massive mobilizations" and the "paralyzation of the productive 
class," the union leaders said. 
  Salas yesterday resigned because of the "irresponsibility" 
of 
some union leaders who are not participating in the 
demonstrations in demand of wage increases organized by the COB. 
Salas nonetheless resumed his post a few hours later to conduct 
the struggle. 
  "I do not think that the decision to begin a dry hunger 
strike is the most appropriate," said Minister of Government 
German Quiroga, who added that "this type of attitude is never 
positive and leads to stagnation."

  [Editorial Report] La Paz Radio Fides Network in Spanish at 
1100 GMT on 28 February carries, in its regularly scheduled 
newscast, several reports on demonstrations, clashes, and 
strikes nationwide. 
  In a 90-second report from Oruro, the announcer comments on 
university students' plans to stage demonstrations today 
protesting the central government's failure to meet fund 
allocation demands; on confirmation by the departmental offices 
of the Bolivian Labor Federation, COB, that local streets will 
be blocked for one hour, beginning 1500 GMT, in rejection of the 
government's failure to meet workers' petition; on a regional 
meeting of union leaders to begin at 1830 GMT to schedule ways 
of exerting pressure on the government during this week; and on 
a Mining Corporation of Bolivia, Comibol, deadline today for 
miners to tender their voluntary resignation and thus become 
entitled to a $1,000 bonus. 
  In a one-minute report from Cochabamba, the announcer 
comments on the declaration of a state of emergency in the 
tropical Chapare region following frequent clashes between coca 
growers and Mobile Rural Patrol Unit, Umopar, agents because 
coca growers refuse to have their plantations eradicated even 
though, in some parts of the department, they are growing more 
coca than the compulsory coca eradication program allows. 
  In a two-minute report from Potosi, the announcer comments 
on 
the miners' harsh criticism of the current administration and 
describes the tragic situation prevailing inside Unificada mine 
where water supply, air supply, and electricity have been 
suspended to force miners to voluntarily resign. The announcer 
also reports on the situation reigning at other local mines and 
protests about the $1,000 bonus from which, in several leaders 
and workers' opinion, a large amount will deducted under the 
concept of social contribution. 
  In a two-minute report from Santa Cruz, the announcer 
comments on local university students' refusal to suspend 
demonstrations -- which on 25 February ended in violent clashes 
with the police and a large number of people injured -- unless 
government meets their fund allocation demands, and on student 
leaders' protests over police violence during said 
demonstrations.

  [Text] La Paz, 27 Feb (EFE) -- The percentage of poor 
families in Bolivian cities increased from 74.7 percent to 80.1 
percent between 1987 and 1991, according to a study carried out 
by the Center of Studies for Labor and Agricultural Development 
(CEDLA) that was released today. 
  CEDLA asserts that eight out of 10 urban families do not 
have 
enough income to pay for their basic needs, according to 
research carried out in La Paz, El Alto, Cochabamba, and Santa 
Cruz. 
  According to the study, 80.1 percent of the urban population 
are poor, of which 49.4 percent are destitute, while the 
percentage of non-destitute (those who earn enough to buy food, 
but not clothes or pay for housing or anything else) reached 
30.5 percent. 
  The CEDLA study, which was disseminated today by the JATHA 
news agency, states that "the neoliberal adjustment implemented 
by Bolivian governments since 1985 has worsened the unfair 
distribution of wealth, increased the concentration of income, 
and reduced the purchasing power of salaries and wages." 
  During the last few years, workers in the largest cities 
extended their work week by four weekly hours, with low 
salaries, lower income, and less labor stability. 
  The researchers said that not only has poverty increased, 
but 
the benefits to which a minority are entitled have been reduced 
as well. 
  The report states that 15 percent of the working population 
obtained half the income generated by the Bolivian economy, 
while the remaining 85 percent of the working population got the 
other half. 
  Bishop Edmundo Abastoflor, chairman of the Bolivian Bishops 
Conference, today warned of the serious social consequences that 
this gap between rich and poor, which increases daily, may bring. 
  "It is shocking to see the squandering of money in the 
downtown areas of Bolivian cities, with luxury cars and 
millions' worth of construction work, while you can also see the 
deterioration in the standard of living of the poor classes," 
said the bishop, who is worried about the increase of poverty in 
the country. 
  Abastoflor said that the poor must be helped with political 
and social measures so that they can improve their standards of 
living with dignity, as is appropriate for human beings.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Bolivia through 24 February: 
  Jack Keenan, National Oil Engineering Directorate manager, 
has reported that proven natural gas reserves total 5 trillion 
cubic feet, which guarantees its supply to Brazil, Argentina and 
other markets. Keenan also said current oil reserves guarantee 
the domestic supply for the upcoming 15 years. (La Paz LA RAZON 
in Spanish 11 Feb 94 p A16) 
  Pablo Zavaleta, state general accounting under secretary, 
has 
reported that 76 percent of the economic area budget is 
earmarked for paying the foreign debt. The Finance Ministry 
allocated 896.4 million bolivianos to meet the debt service in 
the first 10 months of 1993. (La Paz LA RAZON in Spanish 12 Feb 
94 p B2) 
  The Multilateral Investments Fund, under the jurisdiction of 
the Inter-American Development Bank, will grant a $2.3 million 
loan to various Bolivian state-owned companies to finance 
programs designed to promote private investments. (Madrid EFE in 
Spanish 2154 GMT 15 Feb 94)

  [Editorial Report] PLEDGES FOR AGRICULTURAL SECTOR--Oscar 
Ponce, under secretary of forestry and fishing, announced that 
President Sanchez de Lozada has approved a 10-year program for 
the development of Bolivia's agricultural sector. Foreign donors 
pledged $241 million [as published] for this program at last 
December's World Bank-sponsored Consultative Group meeting in 
Washington D.C. Of this amount, $13 million is to be allocated 
for seed purchases and production, $30 million for irrigation 
projects, $16 million for livestock raising, $8 million for 
fisheries, and $184 million for agricultural development. [La 
Paz EL DIARIO 28 Dec] 
  FISHERIES DEVELOPMENT--During the next four years the 
Bolivian Government will invest $14 million to develop the 
country's fisheries industry. A portion of this total, $8 
million, will come from the $241 million package pledged at the 
Washington D.C. Consultative Group donors' meeting. The other $6 
million will be disbursed by the EEC. Among the main projects 
envisaged are the completion of the fisheries station in Beni, 
the construction of a central supply warehouse in El Alto, and 
the consolidation of the Agroyungas Project. [La Paz PRESENCIA 6 
Jan] 
  INVESTMENT IN IRRIGATION PROJECTS--Edgar Talavera, secretary 
for agriculture and livestock, announced that international 
agencies have pledged around $50 million for irrigation programs 
encompassing approximately 50,000 hectares nationwide. He 
explained that irrigation was the most effective way of 
combating rural poverty and raising standards of living. With 
this in mind, the government envisages putting into operation 
the National Directorate of Irrigation and Soils, which would 
coordinate the efforts of all the organizations involved in 
irrigation. [La Paz PRESENCIA DEL PAlS 19 Jan] 
  WOOD EXPORTS--According to Arturo Bowles, manager of the 
National Forestry Board, Bolivia's wood exports in 1993 amounted 
to $25 million. Argentina, the largest market, received 60 
percent of exports, followed by the United States with 20 
percent; the remaining 20 percent was distributed among 10 other 
countries. [La Paz EL DIARIO 7 Jan] 
  SANTA CRUZ EXPORTS--Santa Cruz's rose to approximately $121 
million in 1993, a 12 percent increase from 1992, reported the 
Bolivian Foreign Trade Institute. It listed the most important 
exports as soybeans and derivatives, wood products, cotton, 
sugar, alcohol, and cowhides. The Andean Group is said to be the 
leading market for Santa Cruz exports. Of the $69 million 
generated from exports to that organization in 1993, $43 million 
came from oleaginous crops (soya and sunflower) and their 
derivatives, destined principally for Colombia, Peru, and 
Ecuador. Tito Monasterio, member of the Santa Cruz Chamber of 
Exporters board of directors, said that a project aimed at 
generating $700 million in exports over the next five years is 
planned. Furthermore, the Andean Development Corporation (CAP) 
approved three credit lines of $14 million for three Santa 
Cruz-based enterprises including two vegetable oil production 
plants and the General Industrial and Trading Company, which 
administers the Santa Cruz and La Paz free trade and industrial 
zones. [La Paz PRESENCIA 24, 28 Jan 94; Santa Cruz EL MUNDO 7, 
19, 31 Jan] 
  CAF ASSISTANCE TO EXECUTIVE BRANCH--The president of the 
Andean Development Corporation announced that his organization 
has pledged over $200 million in 1994 for Bolivian Government 
programs, especially those relating to the capitalization 
process. In addition, the CAF has also granted the Bolivian 
Government $487,500 for the "restructuring of the Executive 
Branch and the strengthening of three ministries and one 
secretariat." Of this total, $149,500 will go to the Ministry of 
Human Development, $230,000 to the Ministry of Economic 
Development and Finance, $100,000 to the Ministry of Sustainable 
Development, and $8,000 to the National Secretariat of Trade and 
Industry. [La Paz PRESENCIA 25 Jan; Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS 26

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] After a meeting that lasted all day long yesterday, 
Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso hosted an exclusive 
press conference on the "Fantastico" program. The minister 
clarified the main doubts about the new index, emphasizing that 
financial investment and savings will remain unchanged: 
  [Begin Cardoso recording] We were careful to guarantee that 
savings account owners and those who have invested their money 
will have nothing to fear. Nothing at all has changed. This is 
an old promise. We will not confiscate savings accounts, freeze 
salaries, or freeze the funds of workers, housewives, or anybody 
else. We will not do anything to disturb the Brazilian people's 
routine lives. [end recording] 
  Interest rates: 
  [Begin Cardoso recording] The trend of the program is to 
make 
interest rates drop, as the program has been designed to deflate 
the economy and produce a currency with real value. Interest 
rates will then stand at a normal level. From the beginning of 
this process nominal interest rates will drop. [end recording] 
  New contracts: 
  [Begin Cardoso recording] New contracts will be based 
entirely in URV's [real value units]. Yet this will not be 
enforced immediately, in order to let people become accustomed 
to it over a period of 15 days, so as to learn how it operates. 
After this period the standard will be the URV -- that is, a 
fixed, stable standard. This will remain valid for one year. 
Contracts may not have adjustment clauses. 
  As for old contracts, it will depend on what the contracting 
sides want. There will be time to agree to new terms. [end 
recording] 
  Installments paid by home buyers: 
  [Begin Cardoso recording] They will remain unchanged until 
further notice. There is no reason for any concern about it. 
Installments will be paid in real cruzeiros, based on the old 
rules. [end recording] 
  Health plans: 
  [Begin Cardoso recording] We expect that terms will be 
renegotiated. It will be more advantageous, because contracts 
can be for one year, as I said here, in URV's. It will be more 
practical, and if there is any problem we will solve it. [end 
recording] 
  Credit cards: 
  [Begin Cardoso recording] There will be no modifications. 
Everything will remain unchanged. [end recording] 
  Purchases on credit: 
  [Begin Cardoso recording] There will be no devaluation scale 
whatsoever. New contracts on credit will be specified in URV's. 
We will respect the terms of old contracts. [end recording] 
  Postdated checks: 
  [Begin Cardoso recording] They will be honored. Now, as we 
reach the time for implementation of the URV, we will give the 
rules. In any event, postdated checks will be honored. [end 
recording] 
  Minimum salary: 
  [Begin Cardoso recording] The previous law set the minimum 
salary at 55,500 cruzeiros, as I have just said. Well, if a 
person collects a minimum salary on the fifth working day of the 
following month, the URV conversion will make him collect 62,800 
cruzeiros. If a retired worker were to collect 55,537 cruzeiros, 
which is the minimum salary under the old law, under the terms 
of the new law he will collect 70,600 cruzeiros. 
  The important thing is this comparison in cruzeiros, right? 
The URV, as we said, is approximately equivalent to one dollar. 
One dollar, one URV, right? Therefore, in dollars, if the URV 
is compared to the dollar, the result will be of approximately 
$64. But this amount, the day it is collected, in cruzeiros, 
will be much more valuable than on the first day of the month. 
This is the difference, and this is the real gain for workers. 
[end recording] 
  Past losses: 
  [Begin Cardoso recording] I don't know what past losses are 
all about. Things will depend on the calculation method. From 
now on, negotiations will be free. 
  The government did not order any constraint; it is not 
forbidding negotiations with unions, with employers. Therefore, 
if there is any loss that was not caused by this law, 
negotiations will continue the way they were being implemented, 
and compensations will be agreed upon on the collective 
agreement renewal date. Yet this will the last time, because 
from then on there will be no losses, because of what I said -- 
that if prices go up, salaries will also immediately go up, 
because of the three indexes that I mentioned here. 
Consequently, I do not know whether there will be actually any 
losses. 
  For example, in the case of public workers, in order to 
avoid 
additional complications we granted a bond for February, which 
was included in the basis for calculation of their salaries. 
  Therefore, if the inflation rate were 40 percent in March, 
public servants will not lose anything, not even in March. 
  In April, when public servant salaries would not be 
adjusted, 
they will be adjusted for inflation, by whatever rate, 40, 35, 
or 30 percent, whatever the rate.... This law is actually much 
better. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Alessandra Anselmo] </F>
  [Text] The provisional measure that will create the Real 
Value Unit [URV] was published in the Official Gazette today. 
The final details were decided during a meeting last night 
among President Itamar Franco, Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso, the economic team, six other ministers, and 
the counsel general in Planalto Palace. 
  The final details of the provisional measure to implement 
the 
URV were decided last night during a meeting in Planalto Palace 
that lasted nearly nine hours. Three subjects were decided 
during the meeting: First, the minimum salary value as of 
tomorrow will be $64 or $65. Social Security Minister Sergio 
Cutolo, who also attended the meeting, recalled that with the 
URV, pensioners and retired workers will obtain an average 
increase of 17 percent. 
  It has also been decided that the Labor Ministry will begin 
preparing a law on collective labor bargains. Finance Minister 
Cardoso has said that with the implementation of the URV, 
workers will no longer need to struggle to recover their lost 
purchasing power because this will no longer happen. In the 
future, they will struggle for real wage increases. 
  Minister Cardoso said the provisional measure to establish 
the URV, which is published today in the Official Gazette, 
includes mechanisms to stop abusive price increases. Prices 
will not be converted into URV's. The minister guaranteed that 
this does not represent a price freeze. 
  [Begin Cardoso recording] In case of price abuses, the 
provisional measure includes a provision that allows the Finance 
Ministry to summon private or public oligopolies and companies 
to explain why their prices surpassed the average price increase 
of the previous four months. We will then discuss how these 
oligopolies can transform their prices into URV's. Oligopolies 
are also free to resort to their industry associations to 
achieve a negotiated solution. There will be no price freeze, 
but there will be a mechanism to force those who commit price 
abuses to lower them in keeping with normal market costs. [end 
recording] 
  The finance minister said the economic program is supported 
by the whole government. He said that neither private or public 
sector workers will loose their purchasing power with the 
conversion of their salaries into URV's based on the average 
increases of the previous four months. The finance minister 
said the main objective of the URV is to recover the workers 
purchasing power. 
  The finance minister will today meet at 0830 [1130 GMT] with 
the chief editors of the main newspapers, radio and television 
stations to give a detailed explanation of all the changes that 
will come with the implementation of the economic stabilization 
plan and the URV in people's lives.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Alberto Sardenberg] </F>
  [Text] After two months negotiating the Social Emergency 
Fund (FSE), the federal government budget bill for 1994 is as 
follows: Revenues totalling $89.5 billion, expenditures totaling 
$81.8 billion, and a primary balance of $7.7 billion (without 
including the payment of interests). This is enough to pay real 
interests. Once the interests are paid, there will be a minimum 
operational balance of $2.2 million. In other words, there is 
the balanced budget deemed indispensable for the FHC [Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso] economic plan. The FSE, which stood at $16.1 
billion in its original version, has been cut to $15.5. billion. 
As the FSE seeks to cover gaps in the budget, the $600 million 
that has been cut will have to be compensated by expenditure 
cutbacks. 
  Negotiations with Congress have resulted in an increase in 
the federal government general expenditures by $865 million. 
State and county administrations will benefit from that. In 
accordance with the original budget bill, they would have been 
allocated $11.7 billion. Now, they will receive $13.3 billion. 
This is why governors and mayors supported voting for the FSE. 
  To compensate for what it gave the states and counties, the 
federal government earned $500 million by holding back federal 
public employees' income tax and reducing cost expenditures and 
investment by $700 million. The executive branch will have to 
reduce its expenditures by $500 million. The legislative and 
judicial branches will have to reduce theirs by another $200 
million. In other words, the federal government will continue 
to live on bread and water. 
  From the federal revenue, the budget gained a net $833 
million compared to its December version. There has been a 
positive reevaluation resulting from Cofins [Social Security 
Contributions] revenue and the results of the campaign against 
tax evasion. Another $900 million revenue has been obtained 
through the sale of National Bank for Economic and Social 
Development shares. It is a feasible budget, but its 
implementation will require close control by the Finance 
Ministry.

  [Text] As of now, public and private sector salaries will 
be adjusted by the same rule, that is, the variation in the URV 
[real value unit]. The following are the new rules for 
adjustment of salaries: 
  Private sector salaries will be adjusted by the average 
value 
of the past four months. The value in URV's may not be lower 
than the February payment. Only the basic salary will be 
adjusted, excluding fringe benefits and additional holiday 
payments. 
  The minimum salary will also be adjusted by the average 
value. It will stand at about $64 at the end of March. On the 
date of actual payment, this amount will correspond to 
approximately 58,000 real cruzeiros. 
  Anyone hired less than four month ago will have his salary 
adjusted by the value paid to employees at the same level. 
  The same adjustment rule will apply to public servants' 
salaries, while in addition they will obtain an increase of 5 
percent which will apply for February only. Paychecks will be 
issued in URV's, while income tax discounts will be calculated 
in UFIR's [reference fiscal units]. The FGTS [Severance Pay 
Fund] will be calculated in URV's, to be converted into real 
cruzeiros on the day it is deposited. 
  Workers who are dismissed without justification will be paid 
an additional amount equivalent to 50 percent of their salaries. 
  As of now, anyone hired will have his salary fixed in URV's. 
  With the new salary policy, public servant salaries will not 
be adjusted in March, as they would have been under the current 
policy. This is an initial loss which, according to Federal 
Administration Secretary Romildo Canhim, will be compensated for. 
  [Begin Canhim recording] This temporary loss will be 
practically neutralized by a government decision to grant a 
bonus in February and a small increase in the salary base. [end 
recording] 
  Compensation for salary deterioration for private sector 
workers will be arranged through free negotiations. This is 
progress, according to Labor Minister Walter Barelli, who 
unsuccessfully tried to set the minimum salary level at $100. 
  [Begin Barelli recording] The battle was hard, but 
compensation has been obtained. A decree will be issued today 
creating a commission to increase the minimum salary by 50 
percent in real terms during the rest of this government's term. 
[end recording] 
  The commission created to find ways to increase the minimum 
salary has 60 days to conclude its work. Its members are 
representatives of the Labor, Social Security, Planning, and 
Finance Ministries, and of the Federal Administration 
Secretariat. 
  If Minister Barelli's proposal is accepted the minimum 
salary 
will stand at approximately $100 at the beginning of 1995. 
Today the minimum salary is equivalent to approximately 61,000 
real cruzeiros.

  [Excerpts] Former President of the Republic Joao Baptista 
de Oliveira Figueiredo, who was in office from 1979 and 1985, 
said on 24 February during a barbecue at the Freight Companies 
Union in Rio de Janeiro, that the country is risking a social 
upheaval. "When the people are strong, no Armed Forces can 
resist them," he said. Figueiredo criticized Finance Minister 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic plan, saying there will be 
huge loss of purchasing power. [passage omitted] 
  Figueiredo said he will support General Newton Cruz' 
candidacy for Rio de Janeiro governorship. Gen. Cruz headed the 
National Intelligence Service central agency during Figueiredo's 
presidency. Cruz will run for Rio de Janeiro governorship as a 
Democratic Social Party candidate.

  [Text] The aroma of vatapa [Afro-Brazilian mush], the 
special of the day, drifts past the well-bred nostrils that 
lounge, utensils in hand, around this immense hall that can seat 
500 at a time. Both the food--cheap and served in ample 
portions--and the air conditioning are perfect. Outside on 
Avenida Rio Branco, in the heart of Rio de Janeiro, the 
temperature on these dog days is nearly 40 degrees Celsius. 
People eat well here at the Military Club, a venerable 
association founded in 1887. This is its third headquarters in 
its long history, but although the building has a more 
modernistic appearance, the decor retains touches that are 
somewhat rococo. The atmosphere is still closely identified with 
the air that was breathed, politically and anthropologically 
speaking, in the early 1960's, when it was the meeting place for 
the officers who organized and commanded the so-called 
"Democratic Crusade" that led to the coup of 1964 and the 
deposition of Joao Goulart. The only difference from those 
somber days is that the messmates, now in their sixties, 
although they still employ a conspiratorial tone in their 
conversations can bark orders only to the waiters that glide 
around the large hall--gracefully and with alacrity, may we say, 
but armed only with harmless knives and forks. More out of 
professional duty than any ideological whims, they might venture 
opinions on the virtues of certain salads, of leafy appearance 
and well-suited to a carioca summer's diet. 
  Today, a Wednesday, the hall is full of members and their 
guests, supplemented by those who, although they have never been 
career military men, still have a deep affinity for the club and 
participate with their hearts and minds. At almost all the 
tables one hears debates, sometimes heated, especially when the 
subject is Brazilian politics. They despise, as they have every 
reason to, the blemishes that sully the National Congress. There 
are references to "robbers of the people," (this from a retired 
general, holding his fork aloft like a hypothetical trident from 
hell and using it to jab at the air, gesticulating as if he were 
ready to rummage through the entrails of corruption). "The 
nation has run out of patience, it can no longer put up with all 
these calamities and inertia. If that CPI [Congressional 
Investigating Committee] of theirs ends up doing nothing, as 
people say it will, it would be better to shut down the 
Congress," added--no less emphatically--a colonel and former 
member of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force. Brizola and Lula 
are also mentioned. And so passionately! The former is held 
responsible for the disastrous state of affairs in Rio de 
Janeiro. The latter is held responsible for what might happen 
after the presidential elections. 
  The discussions are interrupted by the sound of squealing 
brakes and shattering glass from the avenue below. Everyone runs 
to the balcony of the restaurant to see what happens. "That's 
the third fender-bender today, the traffic lights are not 
working...this is intolerable...Where's the g...d...governor?" 
raved one colonel--unaware, surely, of the fact that the one who 
is supposed to take care of traffic signals is the mayor, Cesar 
Maia, not Governor Brizola. Short pause for dessert. The coconut 
pudding, passion fruit mousse, and condensed milk custard are 
all excellent. "As you can see, we here at the Military Club are 
a living and dynamic organization. We have a lot of influence. 
Those who think we are just a bunch of retired old men who come 
here to eat and play snooker are wrong," said General Nilton 
Cerqueira, club president and candidate for federal deputy on 
the PP [Progressive Party] ticket in Rio de Janeiro. A 
hard-liner, Cerqueira was the man who hunted Captain Lamarca 
through the backlands of Bahia until he finally gunned him down. 
He was also the man who when in command of the Rio Military 
Police, inexplicably refused to beef up the police force at 
Riocentro at the time of the famous attempted attack attributed 
to sectors of the so-called "intelligence community." Despite 
this background, the general, now 63, is an affable man. His 
professional and ideological past is unequivocal, but Cerqueira 
insists he is a legalist, although he acknowledges that Brazil 
is now going through a crucial phase that in some ways resembles 
the one that preceded the military movement of 1964. 
  "Yes, sir, there is indeed a rebellious sentiment among the 
military. This has been manifested in high levels of the 
military hierarchy, in professional contacts where senior 
officers are being pressured by the junior officers and the 
civilian public," General Cerqueira said, emphasizing that "one 
feels that there is an expectation of a military reaction," in 
the event the corrective measures demanded by the Budget CPI are 
frustrated. But, despite the "climate," there are no practical 
measures to be taken, at least for the time being. "After all," 
he pointed out, "if we were to overturn the tables at this 
point, what would be the ideal model for Brazil? We also have to 
remember that we don't have a Fujimori, and so...." 
  Cerqueira says it is in this direction that the Military 
Club 
is working, serving as a catalyst for opinions and influencing 
things to the extent possible--only to the extent possible. In 
other words, the "ideology" of the club is daring in theory but 
cautious in practice. It seems the club is essentially an active 
center for discussion. This means one should not be swayed by 
the more radical opinions one hears there. "The people in the 
reserve are more impassioned, but what we are really trying to 
do is to open up the spectrum of opinions so that the broad 
meaning of democracy can be discussed," Cerqueira insists. 
Concerning Lula, the general made another categorical statement: 
"Disapproval of the PT is strong among the officers and in the 
Military Club. I can state without fear of contradiction that 
the consensus within the Armed Forces repudiates his ideas." 
Cerqueira is unmoved by the argument that the PT's platform 
appears to be highly favorable to the Armed Forces; it is 
against low pay scales and the "junking" of the institution. The 
general almost leapt out of his chair, and responded vehemently: 
"That does not mean that the PT and Lula are in a position to 
fulfill it." 
  Before saying goodbye, the general insists on taking the 
reporter and photographer into the Military Club museum. There 
in the gallery hang portraits of military men who served as 
president of Brazil, but no picture of General Ernesto Geisel. I 
asked Cerqueira about this absence, and he gave me to understand 
that it is intentional. The general opposed the political 
opening [abertura] launched by Geisel because "it was 
inopportune, done at the wrong time." Nothing more is said but, 
as we left the museum, a museum staffer whispered that "General 
Cerqueira does not like Geisel...." 
  Some of the members and regulars at the Military Club are 
not 
in tune with Nilton Cerqueira's ideas. General Diogo Figueiredo, 
for example, brother of the general and former president, does 
not think the Military Club speaks for the military. According 
to Diogo, the club has a historical tradition but that does not 
mean it can or should compete with political organizations. 
"That would be the same as the bank workers' union attempting to 
control the financial system." The general, incidentally, 
confesses that he thought it very strange that the president of 
Brazil would receive the president of the Military Club to talk 
about matters that are not within its bailiwick. "In my opinion, 
what is happening is a demoralization and a breakdown of 
discipline, since the Military Club is creating a sort of 
parallel hierarchy. The club is a nice place to meet old buddies 
and have lunch, but the institution is not at all 
representative." 
  Diogo Figueiredo is convinced there is no danger of a coup, 
since the Brazilian military is legalist. He recalls that what 
happened in 1964 was a breakdown of hierarchy and discipline in 
the barracks. If a problem of that nature were to arise today, 
then it would indeed be possible that the military chiefs might 
mobilize for action. The general believes, furthermore, that the 
Workers Party is a reality: "If Lula seeks out the military 
leaders to hear what they have to say, wonderful. If he seeks 
out the corporals and noncoms, then I would have to say I do not 
think he will take office." As for the problem of low salaries 
and junking of the Armed Forces, Diogo says that is no reason to 
start thinking of insurrection, because the military are now 
used to living with poverty. But they could never tolerate, for 
example, seeing national sovereignty scorned, sold out. "I am 
referring to the issue of the Amazon region," he concluded. 
  Another eminent representative of the hard line, General 
Sebastiao Jose de Castro, former commandant of the Military 
Region of the Southeast, takes a more moderate position now and 
acknowledges that in the past, the Military Club achieved great 
influence, but said this does not happen today. He said the club 
should defend the interests of the military as a class, but that 
the institution ought not become a sort of labor union. Like 
General Diogo Figueiredo, General Sebastiao Jose de Castro 
thinks the possibility of a coup is remote, and even less likely 
to be fomented or inspired by the Military Club. "See here, men 
who are in the reserve, as General Nilton Cerqueira and I are, 
no longer command the troops and haven't the clout for stirring 
up anything at all, much less carrying out a coup...such a 
person could not even boot out the president of the condominium 
he lives in...but...for the sake of argument, suppose we could? 
We would carry out a coup to accomplish what? To seize a country 
that is in worse shape than in 1964?"

  [Text] Santiago, Chile, 27 Feb (EFE) -- Chile's Christian 
Democratic Party [DC], the leading political party in the 
country, which will on 11 March accede to the presidency for the 
third time, was this weekend shaken by a bitter controversy 
involving moral corruption. 
  A few days before stepping down from office, Chilean 
President Patricio Aylwin launched a thrust against his party, 
which has already been hit badly by the crumbling of the Italian 
Christian Democratic Party, which it has mirrored for a quarter 
of a century. 
  In an unexpected interview granted at the beginning of the 
month to MENSAJE, a magazine belonging to the Society of Jesus, 
Aylwin said that over the last few years the DC -- of which he 
is a founding member -- has lost its values, that its members' 
moral standards are lacking in fortitude, and that they are weak 
in stemming the world tide of corruption and individualism. He 
moreover said that his party runs the risk of transforming 
itself into a mere machine to assign power shares. 
  He further stated that there are card-carrying members of 
the 
DC who have joined the party not prompted by the eagerness to 
serve others, but rather because they see the ruling party as "a 
springboard" for access to highly remunerative government posts 
or to consolidate a political career for their personal benefit. 
  During an interview with the daily EL MERCURIO on 27 
February, Senator Adolfo Zaldivar, one of the budding leaders of 
the DC, responded to Aylwin, commenting that he "was very much 
hurt" by the head of state's utterance. 
  Quite ironically, Zaldivar has harshly criticized his fellow 
party members. In the course of a speech given at a party 
meeting last July that was expressly released to the public, 
Zaldivar warned about "certain black storm clouds" looming 
largely in the party's future. 
  He disparaged what he termed certain people's 
individualistic 
"political careers," and warned against "some persons'" 
intentions of coming to "power for the sake of power." 
  Now, commenting on Aylwin's remarks, Zaldivar asserted: "I 
do not share his opinions in the least. They are unfair, and 
hurt us because of the person who has uttered them. I believe 
that he did so with the best of intentions (...), but the DC is 
not going through a crisis. He speaks about a loss of moral 
strength as motivation for the party's political action, and I 
do not share his views." 
  Notwithstanding this, Zaldivar -- one of the incumbent vice 
presidents of the DC -- once again acknowledges that there is "a 
certain trend toward building a political career for oneself. 
This tendency of power for power's sake must be overcome by 
another trend through which people seek to go into politics to 
serve others. Support should be withdrawn from those who want to 
have access to government posts for their own benefit." 
  Zaldivar believes that all Chilean political parties have 
their "technocratic and elitist caste" because it has managed to 
"infiltrate Chilean society." He even warns that unless this 
state of affairs changes, "social upheavals" may take place as 
in the city of Santiago del Estero in Argentina or in the 
Mexican state of Chiapas. 
  He pointed out: "We live in a continent that is already 
bleeding. This is why political leaders ought never to lose 
their sensitivity. And yet our feelings are hurt when they tell 
us that political parties only give out quotas of power. This 
is not so." 
  Zaldivar is nonetheless optimistic, and in the face of these 
"black storm clouds that blur the DC's path," he adds that "our 
values are extant. Their origin is to be found in the church's 
social doctrine. This constitutes a concept of the human being, 
of solidarity that derives from the Gospels (...) The values of 
Christianity and humanism are permanent in the history of 
mankind."

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Chile monitored through 24 
February 1994. 
  The Central Bank's net international reserves increased by 
$342.8 million in January, of which $301.2 million was the 
result of the balance of payment surplus, while $41.6 million 
came from a revaluation of the reserves. Total reserves now 
amount to $10.1014 billion. (Santiago ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 8 
Feb 94 p 4) 
  On 7 February the Central Bank reported that the trade 
balance registered a $1.5 million surplus during the first half 
of January, compared with the $32.8 million surplus registered 
in the same period last year. Exports totalled $355.7 million, 
and imports $354.2 million, a drop of 12.2 percent and 19.1 
percent respectively compared with the same period in 1993. 
(Santiago ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 8 Feb 94 p 5) 
  The Central Bank has reported that the foreign debt amounted 
to $19.179 billion as of 31 December, an increase of 5.1 percent 
compared with 1992, when it was $18.242 billion. (Santiago 
ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 8 Feb 94 p 6) 
  The mining company El Indio will invest $100 million to 
increase its exploitation of the El Tambo gold deposit located 
in the mountainous area of the Fourth Region. El Indio 
Executive Vice President Ralph Mathson disclosed this 
information following a meeting with Fourth Region Intendant 
Renan Fuentealba. Mathson added that some 350 additional 
workers will be employed for the next six years. The company 
expects to obtain during this period 1.5 million ounces of gold 
and an unspecified amount of silver and copper. (Santiago Radio 
Cooperativa Network in Spanish 1000 GMT 19 Feb 94)

  [Text] New rumors of a coup d'etat caused great turmoil at 
Congress this morning. The new coup was allegedly being 
prepared against President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. 
  It is worth noting that the rumor again had as its main 
actors Deputies Francisco Jose de Vargas and Hermes Rafael 
Saguier, two legislators characterized by their regular reports 
of preparations being made for coups d'etat. 
  The rumor, which did not make clear its origin, the reasons 
supporting it, or who was behind it, rocked congressional 
circles. Following a series of meetings behind closed doors it 
then finally dissipated. 
  Military, government, and ruling party officials 
categorically denied the alleged existence of a coup. 
  The calm congressional morning was broken when a meeting of 
the Chamber of Deputies special commission created to analyze 
the social priorities for the year was abruptly curtailed to 
allow De Vargas, Euclides Acevedo, and Nery Filemon Gonzalez to 
walk to Government Palace. 
  The delegation returned to the Congress building a few 
minutes later, and continued their closed door meeting. Then 
suddenly the meeting was ended and legislators withdrew from the 
premises. The first report, which was later denied, indicated 
that the legislators drove to the 1st Army Corps headquarters in 
Campo Grande, or to the U.S. Embassy. 
  De Vargas denied the rumor, as well as his having visited 
any 
of the above mentioned institutions. He also denied the 
existence of a coup plot.

  [Excerpts] The National Counterterrorism Directorate 
[Dincote] on 10 February confirmed the definite division of the 
Shining Path into two antagonistic factions, which could lead to 
the subversive organization's total defeat. [passage omitted] 
  Police also discovered a Shining Path training camp the 
so-called "People's Liberation Army" and "People's Help" had 
been using for training, physical preparation, and the use of 
guns and explosives. 
  Police reported on 10 February that the training camp was 
located at the top of Casablanca Hill, in the Jose Carlos 
Mariategui shantytown, near Miguel Castro Castro prison in San 
Juan de Lurigancho. 
  During the raid on the area, police found explosives and the 
inscriptions of the aliases of the 10 [number as published] 
alleged terrorists arrested. 
  According to the Dincote report, they have been identified 
as 
Miriam Tarazona Trujillo (21), alias "Rocio," and Jorge Manuel 
Linares Bustamante, 25, alias "Francisco" or "Santiago." The two 
are members of the PCP-SL [Peruvian Communist Party-Shining 
Path] defense department "leadership cell." 
  Police agents presented to the press the following 
individuals as "People's Liberation Army members:" Rolando 
Hector Limachi Arevalo, alias "John," responsible for the 
southern zone; Marco Antonio Huamani Soriano, alias "Mario," 
from the political command; and Shiomara Velasco Chavez, alias 
"Edith," from the military command. 
  Police also presented "combatants" Miguel Angle Santillan 
Coronel, alias "Jefri;" Jesus Honorato Alfaro Barrientos, alias 
"Helton;" Oswaldo Cuya Garcia, alias "Luis;" and Carmen Consuelo 
Llanos Inga, alias "Laura." 
  Also presented in striped uniforms were communicators 
Alejandro Arturo Mayta Manrique, 33, handicapped -- he walks 
with an orthopedic leg with a lot of difficulty; and Jose Carlos 
Lopez Torres, 25. 
  According to Dincote, the last two are allegedly members of 
the Shining Path's "People's Help" apparatus support department 
(health section). 
  The Dincote agents stressed that with the arrest of these 
individuals, police neutralized terrorist activities being 
planned for metropolitan Lima's southern area. 
  In the individuals' possession police found six sketches of 
streets, markets, and religious temples drawn by the PCP-SL 
People's Guerrilla Army to be used in the sabotage of bank 
offices and Pension Fund Administration (AFP) offices, and to 
paint walls, distribute pamphlets, and murder policemen. 
  Dincote charged the arrested subversives with the 
destruction 
of five bank branches, Guido de Surquillo's bakery in San Juan 
de Miraflores municipality, and the frustrated homicide of a PNP 
[Peruvian National Police] lieutenant whose last name is Valle. 
  They also were held responsible for the sabotage against the 
Peruvian Radio Television (Channel 7) station and Latin 
Frequency (Channel 2) building on 14 January 1991 and 5 June 
1992, respectively.

  [Text] Shining Path [SL] top leader Abimael Guzman Reynoso, 
who personally conducted the organization for 13 years of blood 
and terror in his insane idea of "conquering power," has become 
the "executioner" of this terrorist group by creating a deep 
split among the organization members. This split was a result of 
Guzman's letters calling for "a peace accord" to end the 
"fratricidal war." 
  The "II Party Congress," which will be held in March 
somewhere in Lima, will debate the proposals made by the 
opposing factions. The possibility of giving up violence in the 
near future, however, is discarded. 
  One of the factions is the "Right-Wing Opportunist Line 
(LOD) 
[Linea Oportunista de Derecha]" or "Revisionist" faction, which 
is comprised of individuals who support the SL top leader and 
agree with his decision. 
  Edmundo Cox Beuzeville, Nelly Evans Risco de Alvarez 
Calderon, and Osman Morote Barrionuevo, aka "Remigio" -- who are 
some of the subversive group's best-known members -- also are 
part of this faction. 
  By adopting this position, they seek to avoid an inexorable 
defeat. Before this occurs, they believe they must abandon their 
principles to preserve the movement. 
  The other faction is the "Left-Wing Liquidationist Line 
(LLI) 
[Linea Liquidacionista de Izquierda]," the members of which are 
known as "Perfidios." This faction is comprised of the so-called 
"Recalcitrantes," who do not support or agree with the "peace 
accord." They thus ignore the obedience and subordination vows 
they made to "Presidente Gonzalo." 
  According to documents seized and recent SL "Central 
Committee" re-transmissions, as well as testimony by captured 
terrorists, the SL "hard" line on 7 February started the "second 
offensive" of the "second campaign." 
  The escalation of violence began with an attack against the 
Peruvian Air Force's central barracks on 28 de Julio Avenue on 
that day. 
  This faction is supported by Catalina Adrianzen S., wife of 
SL ideologist Antonio Diaz Martinez; and SL leaders Alberto 
Ramirez Durand, aka "Feliciano;" Margie Clavo Peralta; and 
Isabel Rengifo Saavedra; among others. 
  Other terrorists who also support this faction are: Laura 
Zambrano Padilla, aka "Meche;" Martha Huatay Ruiz, aka "Rosa;" 
and Teresa Durand Araujo (Osman Morote Barrionuevo's wife); 
among others. 
  Many of the criminals being held at the Chorrillos women's 
jail also belong to the "Recalcitrantes" faction. The same is 
true of a few criminals held at "Miguel Castro Castro" jail in 
Canto Grande. 
  The "hardness" of the "Perfidios" in these two jails has not 
changed as a result of visits made to them in the last few 
months by high-ranking SL leaders such as Elena Iparraguirre 
Revoredo, aka "Miriam," or Abimael Guzman Reynoso. 
<H5>  Guzman's Message Found </H5>
  Peruvian National Police [PNP] sources reported the 
discovery 
of a message Guzman handed to Martha Huatay Ruiz, aka "Rosa," 
when she visited him at the Navy prison in Callao Port. 
  Huatay hid the message in her genitals and handed it to a 
relative who visited her at the "Yanamayo" jail in Puno. This 
relative was finally arrested by the PNP. 
  The message, which was written on a small piece of paper, 
said among other things: "My arrest is a turn in the path. Join 
the masses; the people will win." 
  This report has not been confirmed or denied by the PNP. It 
shows, nonetheless, the way Guzman is using the government 
officials who have been trying to end the violence that has been 
reigning in the country for the last 13 years.

  [Text] Finance and Economy Vice Minister Alfredo Jaililie 
told EXPRESO that in light of the fact that in 1993 the country 
became once again eligible for receiving funding from 
multilateral organizations (the World Bank, the Inter-American 
Development Bank) it will not be necessary to establish a third 
Support Group this year. 
  This means that we will be able to have access to credit 
facilities, different from bilateral cooperation, for financing 
investment projects. 
  Jaililie moreover explained that the $410 million deficit in 
the balance of payments that had to be covered in 1993 -- which 
entailed having recourse to the second Support Group -- was 
overcome thanks to the aid granted by Japan, which was the only 
country that fulfilled its promise of help in time. 
  Jaililie pointed out that Japan was "the only country that 
staked everything for Peru, and that disbursed exactly the $110 
million it had pledged to give us." He added that this 
contrasts sharply with the United States' attitude, as its 
Congress has raised a number of objections to disbursing its 
$105 million share. 
  As is public knowledge, last year Peru called on countries 
with which it has friendly relations to help it overcome the 
deficit it would incur in its balance of payments. The United 
States and Japan answered this appeal by committing themselves 
to granting us $210 million [as published] of the $410 million 
we needed. The United States would disburse $105 million, and 
Japan $110 million. Some European countries would contribute 
with a smaller share. 
  And yet a year has elapsed, and the United States has not 
yet 
disbursed the promised $105 million because the U.S. Senate has 
charged Peru with violating human rights. Japan on its part has 
punctually paid out its share. 
  Jaililie stated that negotiations with the United States are 
in the hands of Finance and Economy Minister Jorge Camet. The 
only thing that is known about the progress of these 
negotiations is that the U.S. Government -- through AID -- will 
soon disburse $35 million, but nothing has been said about the 
rest of the money. 
  It should be pointed out that the United States is not the 
only one that has failed to honor its commitments. Some 
European countries and international organizations have been 
delaying the disbursement of the funds agreed upon at the 
meeting of the Donors' Board held in Paris in June 1993. 
  To date, the only thing that Peru has been granted is a 
cancellation of its debt with Germany and Switzerland, amounting 
to some $300 million.

  [Text] The state-run news agency ANDINA has suspended 
services indefinitely due to a lack of liquid funds. The ANDINA 
board of directors issued a communique announcing that overdue 
accounts have kept the agency from having the necessary liquid 
funds to maintain operations. ANDINA was financed through the 
sale of advertising space to state enterprises. One of the 
agency's main debtors is SUNAT [National Superintendency of Tax 
Administration], which owes ANDINA more than 1 million new soles. 
  ANDINA Information Manager Francisco Perleche said that 
until 
the liquidity problem is resolved, employees will continue doing 
internal work.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Peru monitored through 17 
February. 
  The auction of the Ilo copper processing plant was suspended 
on 2 February after the three companies that won the 
international bid declined to submit their offers in the face of 
the $70 million base price proposed by the government. They also 
were compelled to make a $20 million minimum investment. (Lima 
LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 3 Feb 94 p 8) 
  The Economy and Finance Ministry on 11 February assumed 
responsibility for the total foreign medium- and long-range debt 
of National Telecommunications Enterprise Peru, Entel Peru, as a 
step to its privatization, which will begin on 28 February. So 
far there are five consortiums interested in buying Entel and 
the Peruvian Telephone Company, CPT. The base price is $525 
million, of which $190 million will be used to increase CPT's 
capital and the remainder will be divided between CPT and Entel.

  [Excerpt] President Rafael Caldera has reported that the 
suspension of economic guarantees is directed at dealing with 
the country's financial crisis. Regarding the Value Added Tax 
[VAT], Caldera said very soon the government will present to 
Congress a general tax reform bill that calls for the definite 
elimination of the VAT on consumers, substituting it with other 
collection mechanisms that will allow those who have more to pay 
more. This announcement was welcomed by the community. [passage

law that will apply to the Banco Latino case will be ready today. 
  Meanwhile, Gustavo Roosen, president of the bank's

financial aid for Banco Latino, something that will allow the 
implementation this week of strategies for the bank's 
rehabilitation. Roosen explained that the banking law that has 
been in effect since the beginning of this year envisages a 
rehabilitation phase as long as the rules set by the Bank 
Superintendency and the Deposit Guarantee Fund during the 
intervention phase are followed. Roosen said the bank has lost 
150 billion bolivares, an amount that can increase or diminish 
depending on the work carried out by the current intervention 
board.

<F P=106> [Report on statement by Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff </F>
on 28 February, place not given; from the "24 Hours" newscast -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Today, Prosecutor General Gustavo De 
Greiff said the antidrug policy is a failure. He insisted on the 
possiblity of legalization and defended the strategy of 
surrendering to justice. As for international cooperation, he 
said the United States prefers to withhold evidence against the 
Cali cartel drug traffickers out of mistrust. 
  [De Greiff] Because they think the Colombian strategy may 
not 
work and because one day those drug traffickers may suddenly 
turn up in other countries and then they will be able to 
apprehend them and take them to the United States, it is better 
to withold evidence. 
  [Announcer] He also said evidence collection in all 
countries 
is neccessary to effectively advance the war on drug trafficking 
and to be able to try drug traffickers because drug trafficking 
is an international offense that begins in the countries that 
produce it, continues in the countries that process and ship it, 
and winds up in the countries that consume it. 
  [De Greiff] To be able put in jail those we believe to be 
mobsters and those the media call mobsters, they have to help us 
and cooperate by submitting evidence. Otherwise, we will not be 
able to realize the goal and....

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 28 Feb (DPA) -- Today, 
Colombian Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff said the U.S. 
Government is not interested in supplying evidence to condemn 
the chiefs of the drug trafficking mafia because it does not 
trust Colombian justice. In this manner, De Greiff reaffirmed 
the difficulties his office has encountered in its attempt to 
collect evidence in the United States against the main "capos" 
of the Cali cartel, several of whom have expressed their desire 
to surrender and collaborate with authorities. "Colombia is 
being deserted. The United States is not interested in 
collaborating with Colombian justice although there are judicial 
exchange agreements," De Greiff pointed out. 
  The prosecutor general added that U.S. authorities are 
"withholding evidence" to reveal later should the mafiosos be 
captured in their country without taking into account that 
several of them are thinking about surrendering in Colombia. In 
the opinion of the director of the Colombian justice system, the 
government in Washington should change its strategy of 
withholding evidence and "open its doors" to criminals who wish 
to surrender and supply valuable information to defeat drug 
trafficking. 
  De Greiff confirmed that his office is still in touch with 
lawyers who claim to represent Gilberto Rodriguez, charged with 
being the leader of the Cali cartel, as part of a rapprochement 
process, started last year and intensified in the past weeks. 
Talks between De Greiff and these lawyers have developed so 
smoothly that the prosecutor general and the media are not 
ruling out the possibility that Rodriguez, who is known by the 
alias of "El Ajedrecista," might surrender in mid-March. 
According to official reports, Rodriguez wants to take advantage 
of the decrees President Cesar Gaviria signed in 1990 offering 
substantial sentence reductions to drug traffickers and 
terrorists who surrender, confess to at least one crime, and 
effectively collaborate with the authorities. 
  Spokesmen for the Prosecutor General's Office claim that one 
of the difficulties facing this process is the lack of evidence 
to indict the mafiosos because many of the charges made in the 
past were leveled by the media and cannot be confirmed. Three 
men charged with being Cali cartel leaders appeared before the 
Prosecutor General's Office in mid-January but were not held 
because there were no warrants for their arrest.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Valle del Cauca Governor Carlos </F>
Holguin Sardi by Dario Arizmendi; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" 
newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Arizmendi] At 1100 today, the last 40 U.S. soldiers 
and engineers will leave Juanchaco for their U.S. base in 
Panama. For this reason, we have called Valle Governor Carlos 
Holguin Sardi at this time of the morning, 0702 to be exact, to 
ask him about the truth to television reports by the "TV Today" 
and "AM-PM" newscasts. According to these two newscasts, the 
U.S. troops that spent 60 days in Valle del Cauca Department 
reportedly buried toxic waste. 
  Mr. Governor, good day. What is the basis for these 
televised reports? 
  [Holguin Sardi] Good morning. Believe me, I am very 
surprised by all of this. I was accompanied by Admiral Ross and 
Major General Jesus Maria Vergara, commander of the Army's 3d 
Division, in Juanchaco on Friday, and no one, absolutely no one, 
expressed any concern or commented on any rumors or hearsay 
about the report disseminated by the television newscasts. In 
fact, television reporters were there, and I do not know when 
they received such reports or why they failed to ask us about 
them there. Had they asked us, we would have at least found out 
about these claims. It seems that this is a new episode in the 
soap opera revolving around the presence of U.S. soldiers in 
Juanchaco. Nevertheless, the report is baseless. I repeat, no 
one mentioned such a tale to me. 
  [Arizmendi] Mr. Governor, the engineers of the U.S. military 
forces came to build a school, a clinic, and to help work on the 
Juanchaco-Ladrilleros road. All of these projects were left 
incomplete. Do you or the national government have a plan to 
complete the projects so that the walls built by the U.S. 
engineers -- who caused so much controversy by their very 
presence -- will not be left abandoned? 
  [Holguin Sardi] The clinic needs plumbing and electrical 
work; everything else is done. The Colombian Army and Navy, 
which are building the nearby Juanchaco airstrip, will oversee 
the completion of the work. The school is a bit behind 
schedule. It needs plumbing and electrical work, as well as 
part of the roof and the inside walls that divide the various 
classrooms. About 80 percent of each of the two projects is 
complete. As I already mentioned, the Army and Navy will be in 
charge of completing the projects. It is estimated that 20 Navy 
workers will finish off in one month what 60 soldiers did in 
eight days in terms of building the school and the clinic. 
  [Arizmendi] Other media have reported that another 
contingent 
of U.S. troops will return to Colombia within two months to 
conduct an operation similar to the one just completed in 
Juanchacho. What do you know about this? 
  [Holguin Sardi] Absolutely nothing. After what has happened, 
I do not believe there will be new similar experiments. The 
fact that the deadline originally set in the agreement for this 
project was not extended is an indication that there is no 
interest in having U.S. troops return for this type of work in 
Colombia. 
  [Arizmendi] After having described the report about possible 
toxic wastes as a soap opera, will any action be taken to deny 
this report? 
  [Holguin Sardi] Yes, it will be very important for the media 
that obtained the report to remember where they got it from. 
[Words indistinct] keeping the source a secret. 
Notwithstanding, if any citizens know anything about this 
report, it is very important for them to inform us about it in 
order that we can conduct the relevant investigations on such a 
terrifying and unpleasant story. 
  I repeat, however, I think it is only a soap opera. No one 
in his right mind thinks that such a thing could happen. The 
Pacific naval forces maintained very strict and complete 
vigilance over the soldiers' activities. There were many 
opportunities to oversee what they were doing. No one could 
prove that they were doing something other than building the 
school and the clinic. They were always concentrating on their 
work. Therefore, I repeat, it is only a baseless rumor, a soap 
opera. However, if we are informed about where, who, and how, 
we would be willing to begin the relevant investigations.

withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Juanchaco area and issued a 
special decree calling for the full hoisting of the flag, which

mast at the City Mayor's Office. The flag had been hoisted at 
half-mast when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers arrived. 
  In the municipal decree, the city mayor said he trusts 
foreign soldiers will never again arrive there without complying 
with legal requirements.

passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] Today, the liberal and conservative parties 
reiterated their concern for the serious public order situation 
in the country. The government promised to defeat terrorism and 
propel the electoral process forward. 
  According to political leaders, there are serious public 
order difficulties in 17 of the country's 32 departments. 
  [Liberal Party leader Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala] "Evidently, 
peace has been broken and, thus, security has deteriorated." 
  The politicians also believe the recent intensification of 
violent guerrilla activities, including abductions and attacks, 
has restricted the candidates' freedom to move about in their 
regions. 
  [National Conservative Council President Cornelio Reyes] "We 
have received reports from several congressional candidates who 
have to campaign in helicopters because they cannot use the 
roads in their departments." 
  Confronted with such a situation, the government asserted it 
is necessary to challenge the terrorist threats. 
  [Government Minister Fabio Villegas] "Our goal is to have 
the 
direct presence of our Public Force in 100 percent of the 
municipal capital cities in the country during the electoral 
process." 
  Furthermore, the political parties charged that the actions 
carried out by the guerrillas have reached an intolerable level. 
  [Reyes] "There are areas, for example, the Aguachica 
municipality, where the guerrillas have not allowed traditional 
parties to open a political office." 
  [Turbay Ayala] "I don't deny there is violence. I, however, 
assert there will be elections." 
  The government affirms the 13 March elections are guaranteed 
by the presence of more than 100,000 Administrative Department 
of Security, police, and Army members.

antiguerrilla warfare specialized police whose mission is to 
guarantee the normal development of the upcoming elections. 
  These nine antiguerrilla police officers are part of an 
elite 
group with a specific mission: To halt subversive attacks 
before and after the elections. Los Granaderos, as they are 
called in combat, just completed a quick course at the Gabriel 
Gonzalez School in El Espinal, Tolima Department, a few hours 
ago. 
  Los Granaderos simulated a patrol action, and they tested 
their reaction in the face of an ambush. These men have a very 
clear idea of their mission. 
  [Begin General Octavio Vargas Silva, National Police 
director, recording] The guerrillas should be duly warned we are 
aptly prepared and armed to counter any attack. We are going to 
do to them what David did to Goliath: wipe them out. [end 
recording] 
  These nine Granaderos are part of a group of 100 men who as 
of next week will be posted at strategic points. The police 
director announced other measures this morning for guaranteeing 
calm during the next elections. 
  [Begin Vargas Silva recording] All vacations, furloughs, and 
permits have been suspended so that as of yesterday and through 
13 March most of the police force will be on the streets, in 
those places we consider sensitive or vulnerable. [end recording]

alias El Gordo, a Medellin cartel member, was carried out 
without a great fuss. 
  Galan was transferred from Santa Fe de Bogota aboard a 
National Police airplane after a judge ruled in his favor when a 
petition was filed requesting he be removed from the military 
garrison where he was being held and sent to a prison. 
  Ospina Montoya was flown from Medellin to the capital aboard 
the same plane. He is to testify before a faceless judge, who is 
in charge of his case, in the next few hours. Ospina Montoya 
surrendered to justice on 4 July 1991 together with La Garra, El 
Angelito, and Icopur. He was one of the few who was unable to 
escape Envigado prison.

<F P=106> [Report by Jesus Garzon; from the "TV Today" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The National Liberation Army guerrillas are 
reportedly financing political campaigns in Casanare, according 
to Colonel Alfonso Plazas Vega. The former commander of the 
Cavalry Academy, which in 1987 assumed control of the Justice 
Palace during the bloody takeover by the 19 April Movement, said 
the guerrillas are holding contacts with candidates through 
third parties to finance their campaigns. 
  [Begin recording] [Plazas] I am talking about candidates for 
governor and candidates for mayor in the municipalities of 
Yopal, Tauramena, and Aguazul. 
  [Government Minister Fabio Villegas] I do not believe the 
guerrillas have that kind of power in the political campaigns in 
Casanare. I am not aware that they are trying to exert 
influence on the political development of the region. 
  [Former President Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala] If that were the 
case, it must be condemned. [end recording] 
  According to Col. Plazas, the guerrillas are extorting 
businessmen by means of this system in Casanare. 
  [Begin Plazas recording] They are threatening candidates and 
asking them for allowances and if the allowances are not given 
they are included on a list of future kidnap victims in order to 
get the money anyway. [end recording] 
  Plazas Vega said that to solve the problem in Casanare, it 
is 
necessary to appoint military governors and mayors in that 
region of the country.

  [Text] In a scene that looked like something out of a war 
movie, 60 members of the Aburra Valley Militia -- wearing hoods 
and carrying weapons -- travelled from Medellin to Ojevas, Sucre 
Department aboard government helicopters. The action is part of 
the process to reincorporate the Socialist Renewal Movement 
[CRS] into society. 
  At about noon today, the 60 men and women of the People's 
Militia of Aburra Valley were taken in two helicopters to the 
camp at Flor del Monte in Sucre where conversations are underway 
on the demobilization of the CRS. For the time being, these 
talks have not led to any significant agreement. 
  [Begin unidentified CRS member recording] The CRS is an 
organization that operates mainly in the cities. Throughout the 
nation it has 3,000 members, of which only 300 are in arms. That 
is the part we are going to negotiate with the national 
government. [end recording] 
  This is the third group of militias that has decided to go 
to 
negotiations in Medellin. Two other groups are conducting 
negotiations with the state in an area close to Medellin. The 
CRS, leader of these militias in the Aburra Valley, hopes that 
this example of urban disarmament will result in the release of 
200 men who are imprisoned before 3 April when the negotiations 
conclude.

  [Text] President Cesar Gaviria initiated an official visit 
to Japan today. Early this morning he met with leading financial 
officials to attract Far East investors to our country. 
  President Gaviria's agenda for the first day of his official 
visit to Japan was tight and very productive. During a meeting 
with the Japanese financial sector, the Colombian president and 
the members of his cabinet emphasized economic and security 
advances achieved by the country in past years. They tried to 
convince Japanese investors of the benefits offered by Colombia 
in the business sector. 
  On another topic, Gaviria asked Japan to reduce its tariff 
barriers and to reconsider its restrictions to the import of 
Colombian flowers. Japanese Government officials and media have 
viewed the Colombian president's visit favorably and expect it 
will yield positive results for both countries.

  [Text] In declarations to the press, Dominican Vice Foreign 
Minister Fabio Herrera stated that the UN has given permission 
to the Dominican Government to sell domestic cooking gas to 
Haiti. He went on to say that this product is not included in 
the trade embargo imposed by the UN and the Organization of 
American States on the Haitian military regime which overthrew 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 1991. Every month, the 
Dominican Republic sends (?650,000) pounds of beef, pork, 
chicken, rice, and other food products to Haiti, as well as 
gasoline, a fuel (?denied) by the embargo. Herrera stated that 
it was in the best interest of the Dominican Republic to 
attenuate [atenuar] the embargo because the worsening situation 
in Haiti is one of the factors that causes Haitians to seek 
refuge in the Dominican Republic. He warned of a possible social 
eruption [estallido].

  [Text] Guatemala City, 28 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- The Guatemalan 
Army has confirmed its support for President Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio and the democratic process and asserts in a communique 
released today that the head of state has preserved the 
"apolitical nature" of the Armed Forces. 
  The Army denied that the president had intended to implicate 
it in political-electoral activities, as General Jose Luis 
Quilo, the dismissed chief of the General Staff of National 
Defense, asserted on Friday. "No effort has been made to 
manipulate the Army, and the president has not handed down 
instructions to influence the Civil Defense Volunteer 
Committees," the communique underscored. 
  Quilo accused de Leon of having asked Army commanders to 
exert pressure on the civilian patrols so they would vote in 
favor of the constitutional reforms during the popular 
referendum on 30 January. 
  The president and Defense Minister General Mario Rene 
Enriquez denied the allegations, and they both pointed out that 
Quilo's remarks reflected his resentment at being dismissed from 
his post. The Army says the general's assertions were distorted 
and today confirmed its "total respect for the country's 
institutionalism and its support for the current government." 
The Armed Forces also urged every sector of the country to 
intensify its efforts in favor of peace and national 
reconciliation. 
  Meanwhile, the defense minister announced that if Quilo 
insists on leveling accusations against the president and Army 
he could be taken to court.

  [Editorial Report] Buenos Aires LA NACION in Spanish on 7 
February publishes, on page 13, a 220-word unattributed article 
on Argentine exports to Brazil, which totaled $266.2 million in 
December, "the highest historical record registered in bilateral 
trade relations in one month." It notes that this represents an 
increase of 125 percent compared with the same month in 1991. 
The article says that exports totaled $2.634 billion and 
imports $3.661 billion in 1993, which represents a $1.026 
billion surplus for Brazil but a drop of 23 percent compared 
with 1992.

  [Text] Brasilia--Minister of the Environment and the Legal 
Amazon Rubens Ricupero yesterday told members of the Amazonia 
Parliamentary Front that he thinks it is ridiculous to talk 
about a campaign to internationalize Amazonia and said this 
country should pay more attention to channelling foreign funds 
to finance large environmental projects in the region. 
  To Ricupero, the charge that foreign interests, with the 
support of missionaries who work in the area, are working to 
prevent the exploitation of the region's mineral reserves on the 
pretext of the need to demarcate Indian lands is "a fallacy." 
"It does not look to me like a hydra-headed monster," Ricupero 
said in response to the legislators' insistence that some action 
be taken. The minister recalled that the Constitution now 
permits exploitation of minerals in the region, and urged that 
the Congress give prompt approval to legislation that would 
regulate the mining and minerals prospecting in Amazonia. 
  According to one of the minister's advisors, Ricupero knows 
that powerful lobbies [preceding word in English] are active in 
these early stages of the constitutional revision, trying to 
hinder the demarcation of Indian lands. One of the proposals 
submitted would require each demarcation to pass through 
Congress, thus reducing Funai's autonomy. 
  In asking for a law that would regulate the use of Indian 
lands, Ricupero gave us an idea of what he would like to see 
passed. The minister said that when a permit to mine on Indian 
land is granted, the authorized company should be required to 
compensate the community with a percentage of the profits and to 
invest in social projects in the area, such as construction of 
schools and hospitals. 
  "If they are to survive, Indian communities need to receive 
something in return for the riches that they have on their 
lands," said Ricupero, who advocates a change in the Indian 
Statute. In his opinion, the Office of Government Attorney 
[Ministerio Publico] should oversee the entire process.

<F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella: "We Do Not Want </F>
To Be Outcasts"] 
  [Text] Our active commitment to the nonproliferation policy 
in the field of missiles, chemical weapons, and nuclear energy 
represents one of the key points of the so-called Argentine 
foreign policy's "Copernican revolution." 
  We espoused this commitment by principle, and in pursuit of 
our interests. 
  By principle, because one of the priorities of the 
international community in which Argentina, within its reach and 
possibilities, now plays a leading role undoubtedly consists in 
preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
  In pursuit of our interests, and thanks to this policy (and 
within the framework of the transformations our country is 
carrying out), Argentina is regaining trust and credibility. 
And this is translated into a reduction of the so- called 
Argentine risk, a decline in the cost of loans, an increase in 
investments, and access to sensitive technology that had been 
banned for us. Without the nonproliferation policy, Argentina 
would be described today as an outcast country, estranged from 
the Western world from a political, technological, and economic 
viewpoint. 
  Changes in the international political system and in the 
progress made by great powers to achieve disarmament have 
modified public and political stances on the acquisition of 
nuclear weapons, and have contributed to creating a closely-knit 
atmosphere in the sphere of nonproliferation. 
  The international community has become fully aware that the 
acquisition of nuclear weapons jeopardizes international peace 
and security and mankind's survival. 
  Proof of this is that at the beginning of 1992 the UN 
Security Council declared for the first time that the 
proliferation of weapons of massive destruction constitutes a 
"threat to international peace and security." 
  Within this framework the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
(NPT) signed in London, Moscow, and Washington on 1 July 1968, 
and effective since 5 March 1970, is considered to be the 
bulwark of nonproliferation. 
  This international legal instrument enables nonnuclear 
states 
to freely confirm that they renounce nuclear weapons in a formal 
and internationally binding way. Moreover, by observing the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, they can 
prove that such a commitment is faithfully honored. 
  This has been the path so far taken by some 160 countries -- 
South Africa, which has an important nuclear program, followed 
this example. Only 30 states, including Argentina, have not 
adhered to the NPT. 
  Not long ago President Menem officially expressed his 
decision to join this important international instrument in the 
future. This bears direct relation to and is the culmination of 
the path taken by our government, which enabled the issuance of 
Decree 603/92 on the control of the exportation of sensitive 
material, signing the Quadripartite Safeguards Agreement between 
Argentina, Brazil, the ABACC [Brazilian-Argentine Agency for 
Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials] and the IAEA, 
establishing the ABACC, joining the Tlatelolco Treaty, and 
participating as an observer to the group of nuclear supplying 
countries, of which it will soon become a member. 
  It should be pointed out that by virtue of the Quadripartite 
Agreement and the Tlatelolco Treaty, our country meets all the 
requirements established by the NPT. 
  The signing of the NPT will earn our country international 
confidence and openness in our nuclear activities, and will 
contribute to consolidating the international high standing we 
have built up for ourselves concerning nonproliferation. 
Besides, it will facilitate and boost the exchange of new 
technologies with countries that are more developed in this 
area. It will also enable us to have greater clout when the 
renewal of the NPT is discussed next year, so as to be able to 
include more stringent provisions for the disarmament of nuclear 
countries. 
  And above all one must not lose sight of the fact that the 
current nonproliferation system is based on an international 
treaty (NPT) signed by the majority of states. This means that 
nonproliferation cannot be effectively imposed only by powerful 
states or suppliers of nuclear technology and materials, but 
rather by the experience and action of the international 
community in its entirety.

  [Text] Antarctic Flotilla Commodore Jaime Urdangarin Romero 
on 11 February reported that the first international meeting of 
commanders of Antarctic bases in the South Shetland Islands was 
held at President Frei Base. The meeting's purpose was to reach 
an agreement on measures and draft a plan to combat sea 
pollution, especially that caused by oil slicks. 
  Representatives from Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Peru, 
Brazil, 
Poland, the PRC, the ROK, Russia, and Ecuador who attended the 
meeting committed themselves to asking their respective 
governments to buy the standard antipollution material suggested 
by the Chilean Navy. They decided to draft a concerted action 
program at their next meeting. 
  Commodore Urdangarin stated: "All the participants 
acknowledged that Chile is the only country that has the ways 
and means to combat pollution in the Antarctica in a systematic 
way. We have both the qualified people and the infrastructure 
in the vessels of the Chilean Navy's Antarctic Patrol and the 
Prat Base and Fildes Port Garrison." 
  He underscored that this initiative was materialized by 
Admiral Jorge Martinez Busch, the Navy commander in chief, who 
had the foresight to plan for possible problems arising from the 
increase in sea traffic. 
  On that occasion, the commanders of the bases and stations 
in 
the South Shetland Islands located in Antarctica, agreed to 
appoint the Chilean Navy's Antarctic Patrol as the operations 
coordinator in case of a possible environmental disaster in the 
area. 
  At present, only the Chilean Navy has the necessary vessels, 
equipment, and staff to face an emergency such as this, as well 
as to undertake rescue operations with the Antarctic Patrol.

  [Text] Montreal, 1 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Cuban exiles living in 
Canada are spreading false rumors to disrupt Havana-Ottawa ties, 
Cuban and local sources stated today, denying the alleged 
expulsion of Cuban diplomats. 
  Cuban diplomatic sources denied Canada had expelled Adolfo 
Martin and Orlando Brito, two officials of the Cuban Consulate 
in Montreal, as Cuban dissidents Pedro Martori and Antonio Tang 
reported in Montreal. Martori and Tang, who represent 
Miami-based radical dissident groups told the Canadian media 
that Canada had expelled Consul Martin and Vice Consul Brito. 
  Cuban Ambassador in Havana Carlos Castillo told NOTIMEX 
diplomats from any country are subject to rotation and Martin 
and Brito had completed their assignments a few weeks ago. A 
Cuban diplomatic source concurred with the Canadian Attorney 
General's Office in explaining that Martin and Brito had been 
living in Montreal for years, and "their term had to end 
someday." 
  Political sources told NOTIMEX the report on the expulsion 
"is related to the expansion of economic relations between 
Canada and Cuba," and, in particular, to the investments 
Canadian mining and hotel companies and other sectors are making 
in the Caribbean island. 
  Cuban solidarity groups stated the Cuban exiles in Canada, 
linked to radical groups in the United States, are "upset" over 
the Havana initiative of beginning this month a dialogue with 
sectors of the Cuban exile community. "Alpha 66" -- a 
Miami-based dissident group -- "continues to issue communiques, 
stating it will attack Canadian tourists who go to Cuba. It is 
a sign of their powerlessness regarding the dialogue" between 
Havana and the Miami community, a Cuban source affirmed. 
  Canadian Government circles, which supported the idea of a 
dialogue between Havana and the exiled community, admit Cuban 
opposition groups are "very resentful" of the good relations 
that exist between Canadian businesses and Cuba. The expulsion 
story was a recent reaction by radical Cuban exiles aimed at 
adversely affecting business contacts between Cuba and Canada. 
  In April 1993, Tang and Florencio Aspillaga Lombard -- 
another Cuban exile living in Miami -- told DIARIO LAS AMERICAS 
of Miami that Ottawa had suspended the firm Rapitel 
Communications S.I.'s permission to operate in Cuba. The 
statement made by Tang and Aspillaga Lombard about this company, 
which sells telephone communications service with Cuba, also 
turned out to be false. Canadian analysts said the report was 
aimed at eliminating telephone service between Canada and Cuba, 
which serves as a bridge for numerous Cubans living in the 
United States. 
  According to the sources that were consulted, another reason 
for the "charge" made by Martori and Tang was a result of the 
support given in Canada to the "Cuban friendship caravan," an 
initiative to send humanitarian aid to the island. The caravan 
left various Canadian cities on 20 February destined for Mexico 
from where caravan members will sail to Cuba. The caravan will 
pass through various U.S. cities and will join the efforts made 
by the "Pastors for Peace," who for the third consecutive year 
will send humanitarian aid to Cuba and will confront the 
economic blockade imposed on Cuba by Washington three decades 
ago.

  [Text] The visit by a Venezuelan delegation from Cojedes 
State, headed by its governor, Jose Felipe Machado, concludes 
today. The last official activity of the delegation was the 
signing of accords and a sister cities act. 
  Three letters of intent regarding exchanges and cooperation 
between Cojedes and Cuba on health, sports, and housing were 
signed by Governor Machado and Cuban authorities from the 
respective spheres at a ceremony held this morning at the seat 
of the National Assembly of the People's Government. After the 
signing, Machado pointed out the importance of this event: 
  "These mutual cooperation accords will allow me, as governor 
of Cojedes State, to solve many problems which the science and 
resources available there cannot solve. I am pleased with the 
support and cooperation from the Cuban Government, all its 
mid-level authorities, and deputies for their kindness, support, 
and efforts to seal the unity of the people today. The unity of 
the people is sealed with deeds, with realities, with good 
things." 
  The five-day trip ends today. The delegation includes 
members 
of the governor's office and Professor Filipio Duran, vice 
director of the Latin American University.

you 
have here in terms of health, sports, and housing construction."

  [Text] Guido Nule Amin, Colombian minister of mines and 
energy, reiterated on 1 March that the sale of oil to Cuba is in 
good standing. Colombia is studying the best options to sell oil 
to Cuba under international and commercial terms. 
  This statement was made in light of the fact that Cuban 
exiles in the United States are discussing the possibility of 
boycotting Colombian products, which, according to Nule Amin, 
can only hurt small Colombian businessmen in cities in Florida. 
Nule Amin added that Colombia views with interest the 
possibility of trade with Cuba and sees no reason that Colombia 
cannot sell oil directly to Cuba. 
  A review process of all the terms of the operation is under 
way, particularly issues regarding forms of payment. Nule Amin 
stressed that Cuba exports such products as sugar, fruit, 
tobacco, rum, and nickel. He added that with these exports, Cuba 
can guarantee payment for the fuel.

  [Text] To promote scientific-technical activity as a 
solution to the current limitations and difficulties, the 
Ministry of Sugar Industry [Minaz] -- with Granma, Guantanamo, 
and Santiago de Cuba Provinces participating -- has held an 
exhibit and workshop in Santiago de Cuba entitled Problems Bank. 
  Workers analyzed the problems of a lack of equipment and 
spare parts and the immediate possibilities for expanding 
achievements the industry has made. Sugar Industry Minister 
Nelson Torres reiterated the need to find immediate solutions in 
a spirit of cooperation so as to overcome resource shortages. 
  Eugenio Maynegra, head of the Department of Science and 
Technology of the Central Committee [of the Communist Party of 
Cuba], said the goal is to improve in the energy area. To that 
end, work is already being done to install vacuum pumps and to 
cool turbogenerators and evaporators. 
  The exhibit highlighted the difficulties and problems being 
faced by this sector in agriculture, transportation, the sugar 
industry, the by-products industry, construction and assembly, 
and self-sufficiency, for example. 
  A new period of great challenges is beginning for Minaz 
workers, from the base-level worker to the highest 
administrator, in each of its organizations.

  [Text] Havana, 28 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Ernesto Melendez, 
minister president of the State Committee for Economic 
Cooperation, said in Havana that companies formed with foreign 
investment in Cuba now number 129. Of the 129 "economic 
partnerships," 32 are tourism-oriented, said the Cuban official, 
whose remarks were published on Monday by the business weekly 
OPCIONES. 
  The weekly, which was first published in January by JUVENTUD 
REBELDE, the official mouthpiece of the Union of Young 
Communists (UJC), is aimed at foreign businessmen interested in 
investing in the island. 
  Melendez, director of foreign investment in Cuba, also 
disclosed that his ministry has received 149 more applications 
to form joint ventures, the first of which appeared three years 
ago. 
  "We form partnerships with foreign businessmen who provide 
financing, capital for new facilities, and modern technology 
that allows us to produce on a competitive level," he pointed 
out. Melendez explained that most foreign investment in Cuba 
comes from Spain, followed by France, Great Britain, the 
Netherlands, Italy, and Sweden, which are also primary sources. 
He added that Europe has invested more capital than America, 
including Canada, Mexico, Chile, and the Caribbean nations, and 
the duration of partnerships fall within a 10-25 year range. 
  Melendez explained that coinvestments range from the 
exploration and exploitation of oil to industrial production and 
tourism administration. Nevertheless, he rejected the 
possibility of "speculative or questionable operations" in the 
future. 
  Melendez said that multinational conferences on investment 
will be held this year in Cuba and will be similar to those 
sponsored by the British editorial group Euromoney in 1993 in 
London, Cancun, Mexico City, and Havana. 
  A constitutional reform in 1992 permitted joint ownership of 
capital goods in Cuba, an unprecedented shift in the country's 
former state monopoly-type economic structure.

  [Text] Havana, 28 Feb (DPA) -- The "underground economy," 
or black market, which reached incalculable levels in Cuba last 
year, obtains its commodities primarily from state-owned stores 
and enterprises, the biweekly magazine BOHEMIA acknowledged 
today. 
  In the latest magazine edition, Aracelis Careaga, vice 
president of the National Commission of Social Attention and 
Security, attributed black market related crimes, such as 
robberies and misuse of resources, to the lack of controls. 
  The official also cited as a cause of the phenomenon "the 
slackness of those who must guard the people's properties, 
coupled with the existence of unscrupulous individuals who take 
advantage of the situation in which we find ourselves to enrich 
themselves." 
  Cuba is facing a serious economic crisis characterized by a 
lack of products, rampant inflation, an excess of financial 
liquidity, and a resulting increase in black market activity. 
  Nearly 11 million Cubans receive a reduced basket of basic 
foodstuffs at subsidized prices via a ration card which has been 
limited in the last few years as a result of the economic crisis. 
  According to analyses made by independent economists, the 
people barely satisfy 40 percent of their food needs via the 
ration card, but they are forced to resort to the black market 
for the rest. 
  "There is no doubt many of the items that are sold at 
exorbitant prices on the black market come from state-owned 
stores, enterprises, and units that are supplying that market," 
Careaga affirmed. 
  "The social cost of these actions is so high that if no 
authority exists, we must look for one to act against it, but we 
must do it urgently," the official remarked. 
  Cuban authorities have been maintaining since last August a 
police offensive against crime, particularly against the illicit 
economic activity of robbery and speculation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Cabinet Expecting Better Relations </F>
With Antilles. Antilleans Voting Government Parties Out"] 
  [Text] Willemstad/The Hague -- The cabinet and all major 
parties in the House of Representatives believe that the outcome 
of the elections on Curacao and on the other islands, will have 
a favorable impact on relations between the Netherlands and the 
Antilles. According to Antillean and Aruban Affairs Minister 
Hirsch Ballin, a "wind of change" will blow across the islands 
with the new party PAR [Antillean Restructuring Party]. 
  VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] 
Representative 
Wiebenga, chairman of the Permanent Chamber Committee on 
Antillean Affairs, also believes that dealings with winner and 
presumable President Miguel Pourier will be better than with his 
predecessor Mrs. Liberia-Peters. Just like the VVD, the PvdA 
[Labor Party], D66 [Democrats 66] and CDA [Christian Democratic 
Appeal] are also pleased with the outcome. All parties consider 
Pourier to be a competent and reliable politician. 
  According to Wiebenga, the opposition's victory, including 
on 
St. Martin, is no reason to lift Netherlands control over St. 
Martin right away. "Problems are still too big to do so. 
Improvements will have to take place on St. Martin itself. In 
addition, we will first have to wait for the elections for the 
island councils, which are only scheduled for next year." In 
the island councils, the parties who have won now, are still in 
the minority. 
  The new party PAR, which won a historic victory on Curacao 
last Friday during the elections for a new Antillean Parliament, 
is only two months old. The party won eight of Curacao's 14 
seats, and overwhelmingly defeated Maria Liberia-Peters' 
governing PNP [National People's Party], which fell back from 
seven to three seats. On the other Antillean islands, the 
governing parties were also defeated. 
  The governor will charge the PAR with forming a new 
government, with Party Leader Miguel Pourier as presumable 
president. After consultation with parties from the other 
islands, he will see which national coalitions can be formed. 
Until then, Paula's resigning interim cabinet will stay on. 
  Last October, the PAR started as a movement which stood up 
for "the preservation of the Antilles" during the referendum on 
Curacao's political future. 
  Former President Maria Liberia-Peters admitted the PNP's 
loss. "The population has spoken, and we will respect its 
decision. Apparently, we failed to express our views clearly 
enough." 
  The MAN [New Antilles Movement], under the leadership of Don 
Martina, kept its two seats, and the Democratic Party its only 
seat. In Curacao, two parties will disappear from Parliament: 
FOL [Workers' Liberation Front] had three seats, Our Country 
one. 
  On St. Martin, the rule of the Democratic Party (DP) of 
controversial Leader Claude Wathey, has come to an end. The 
opposition party SPA [St. Maarten Patriotic Alliance] won three 
out of the Windward Island's three parliamentary seats. Two 
years ago, the SPA had already defeated the DP during the 
elections for the island council, but was nonetheless kept out 
of the island's government. 
  On Bonaire, the UPB [Bonaire Patriotic Union] had to cede 
two 
seats to the oppositional Democratic Party-Bonaire headed by 
Jopie Abraham. The governing parties, the Democratic Party, and 
the WIPM [Windward Islands People's Movement] respectively, only 
remained in power on the smallest islands of St. Eustatius and 
Saba.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 1 Mar (EFE) -- Today, authorities 
said three persons died and another person suffered serious 
burns following a fire at a house that operated as a gasoline 
warehouse in Dajabon City, bordering Haiti. 
  The deceased, Dominican brothers Ramon and Ovidio Taveras, 
and Haitian Leonel Solis, 25, were burned to ashes while Osiris 
Hernandez, 27, was admitted to the regional hospital Jose Maria 
Cabral y Baez in Santiago City with serious burns. 
  The fire occurred at one of the many family homes that have 
been converted to store fuel which is eventually sold in Haiti. 
Many residents in the border city of Dajabon earn their living 
selling gasoline by taking advantage of the current embargo 
against neighboring Haiti.

  [Text] France favors the reinforcement of international 
sanctions to reestablish a democratic regime in Haiti. This 
statement was made on 28 February by French Foreign Affairs 
Minister Alain Juppe after an interview in Paris with President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. In the Security Council we are defending 
a draft resolution reinforcing the sanctions against those who 
do not respect the Governors Island accord, signed in July but 
not respected by the military regime, Juppe said. According to 
Juppe, France intends to support the return of democracy in 
Haiti and the return of the legitimately elected president, 
political dialogue, and the reconciliation of all Haitians. 
  For his part, President Aristide considered that his meeting 
with the head of French diplomacy had been fruitful. A 
resolution reinforcing the sanctions on the military would be in 
conformity with the July agreement, the president pointed out: 
  [Begin Aristide recording, in Creole] In fact, today [28 
February] I met with France's minister of foreign affairs. I was 
very pleased to meet him. We discussed three points and agreed 
on all three. 
  The first point is the matter of the crisis, i.e., whether 
France has changed or has maintained its position in support of 
ours. The foreign affairs minister asserted that the position 
remains the same: They support our position. 
  A draft resolution is to be presented to the Security 
Council, which is upside down, upside down [repeats himself]. We 
talked about it and he said that his position, the position of 
France, was the same as that of the constitutional government 
which respects the Governors Island accord, which demands that 
the military resign, in conformity with the agreement; then we 
will proceed to the formation of a government which must issue 
from dialogue, as we usually do, in order to achieve 
reconciliation and justice for all. Thus, in this sense, I 
believe that it is a first point on which the French Government 
and we, the Haitian Government, agree. 
  The second point regards the police. We agree that the 
police 
should not be a force for repression of the people of the 
nation. There is a proposal, provided for in our Constitution 
and in the Governors Island accord, that invites Haitians living 
in the country to join us and Haitians abroad to receive 
training, just as we have done with about 60 who have already 
been trained in the United States. Others will be trained in 
Canada. France is considering doing the same. Thus, we agree to 
study such a project with France. 
  The third point is our refugees. [end recording] 
  It should be noted that France is in the group of countries 
called Friends of Haiti, which includes the United States, 
Canada, and Venezuela. The question of reinforcing the sanctions 
against Haiti was recently a point of divergence, with Canada in 
favor and Washington reluctant. 
  President Aristide has been in Paris since 26 February on a 
four-day private visit. He was scheduled to meet President 
Francois Mitterrand on 1 March.

  [Text] The National Cooperative Action Movement [MKN], the 
MODELH-PRDH [Democratic Movement for the Liberation of 
Haiti-Democratic Revolutionary Party of Haiti], and the [Bel-Air 
branch of the] Movement for the Organization of the Country 
[MOP] have issued a new joint statement. These three political 
parties say the legislature does not have the authority to enact 
laws with a view to forming a provisional government under 
Article 111 of the Constitution. 
  [The leaders of these parties, respectively] Volvick Remy 
Joseph, Francois Latortue, and Greger Jean-Louis, affirm that 
logically, no government can be formed before the dismissal of 
the president, in keeping with constitutional procedure. 
  The three leaders point out that the Senate reinstated 
President Aristide as president of Haiti and that the Army 
acknowledged his legitimacy by signing the Governors Island 
agreement. These three party leaders explain that the text of 
Article 111 as a general clause cannot replace a particular 
clause. 
  The MODELH-PRDH's Latortue has labeled the behavior of the 
international community as...[rephrases] has criticized the 
behavior of this community, which has imposed economic sanctions 
on Haiti. 
  [Begin Latortue recording, in Creole] Those sanctions affect 
mostly the lower strata of society: the poor, the poorest of the 
poor. Those who are in the middle class manage so their arms are 
not competely broken when the ball is falling down. [sentence as 
heard] Those who are at the lower level, however, can do 
nothing. They are suffering. When fuel is as expensive as it is, 
fares are high. The unfortunates who cannot pay the fares at all 
will be obliged to walk. 
  When the prices of all items increase, when the prices of 
milled corn and rice increase, many people cannot eat those 
things because they cannot afford them. 
  At present, many children are dying of tuberculosis. Their 
parents do not have money to buy medicine, nor even to provide 
the children with food. A situation such as this must end as 
quickly as possible. Meanwhile, the leaders themselves have 
plenty of money. They wear nice clothes and have money in their 
pockets, but the masses have nothing and are dying. 
  I do not know what his [not further identified] reasons are. 
However, in my opinion, an end should be put to this situation. 
I believe that thanks to the pressures or...[rephrases] he [not 
further identified] will eventually understand that forming a 
new government is an urgent necessity. Otherwise, I believe, the 
international authorities will be obliged to take measures. [end 
recording]

  [Text] In the Senate of the Republic, the office led by 
Senator Bernard Sansaricq has dissociated itself from the steps 
taken in Washington by a group of legislators. In a communique, 
Secretary Ebrane Cadet has expressed the Senate's astonishment 
upon reading the letter sent by a group of legislators who went, 
informally, to Washington. 
  Cadet said that he was surprised to see that the legislators 
referred to Senator Firmin Jean-Louis as president of the 
Senate. The letter was also signed by Senator Yvon Gislain, 
calling himself Senate secretary. 
  The office headed by Sansaricq expressed a number of 
reservations regarding this matter, recalling that under a 4 
February resolution the former office, headed by Firmin 
Jean-Louis, was duly dismissed and replaced by the current 
office, headed by Bernard Sansaricq.

  [Text] CARENA, Action Committee for National 
Reconciliation, reminds the Haitian population that its 
activities at the national and international level have achieved 
many results during the past few days. According to CARENA, some 
of the arrangements include the formation of an ad hoc 
government, a government of concord and of national 
reconciliation under Article 111 of the Constitution, in 
compliance with the resolution adopted at the national 
conference on 6-8 February. The parliament is scheduled to 
examine a law related to this resolution as soon as possible; 
all the steps toward that end were laid out by the office of the 
conference. 
  CARENA also advises that it has outlined to international 
institutions the steps by which, on the one hand, the sanctions 
against Haiti scheduled since the beginning of January 1994 can 
be set aside and, on the other hand, the idea of not hastily 
reinforcing those sanctions can be maintained. 
  CARENA asserts that contacts at the highest level have been 
established for the purpose of immediately supplying the local 
fuel market and that a solution is under study. 
  CARENA claims it is working day and night with national and 
international decisionmakers on the Haitian issue and cautions 
that the task of national reconciliation can not be fulfilled in 
an atmosphere of pressure, tension, and sanctions.

  Fidel Velasquez, leader of the Confederation of Mexican 
Workers, confirmed on 23 February there are 7 million unemployed

  The Bank of Mexico has reported that the accumulated 
inflation so far this year amounts to 1.1 percent, which is the 
lowest rate in two decades. Bank officials added consumer

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Costa Rican economic developments monitored through 1 
March. 
  The Costa Rican Government has paid the $19 million it owed 
up to December 1993 on its debt with the Paris Club. Although 
Finance Minister Carlos Munoz admitted the existence of gaps in 
the payment of the foreign debt, he said the government has made 
an effort to put its foreign accounts in order, thanks to which 
it has been able to obtain loans for both the public and private 
sectors. (San Jose LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 15 Feb 94 p 14A) 
  The Exports and Investments Promotion Center, CENPRO, has 
disclosed that in January 1994 Costa Rica's exports increased by 
more than 2 percent over its exports during the same month in 
1993, going from $202 million in 1993 to $207 million in 1994. 
However, if income from tourism is excluded, exports for the 
month dropped below the levels recorded in 1993. CENPRO adds 
that tourism and nontraditional exports increased while 
traditional and manufactured goods exports decreased. In 
January 1994 the country collected $54 million from tourism and 
$152 million from traditional, nontraditional, and manufactured 
goods exports. (San Jose LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 16 Feb 94 p 
10C) 
  The National Banana Corporation [Corporacion Bananera 
Nacional], Corbana, has disclosed that Costa Rica's banana 
exports increased by 10.61 percent in 1993 despite the 
restrictions imposed by the European Union, EU, on Latin 
American bananas. In 1993 Costa Rica exported almost 101 
million 18 kg-boxes of bananas, approximately 10 million more 
than in 1992, and 46 percent of them were sent to European 
countries, which proves that the EU quota reduction did not 
affect Costa Rican trade. (Paris AFP in Spanish 1638 GMT 22 Feb 
94)

  [Text] Armando Calderon Sol, Arena [Nationalist Republican 
Alliance] presidential candidate, has supported the government's 
decision to investigate thoroughly the attack before stating it 
was an act of violence with political connotations. Alfredo 
Villarreal has filed a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Villarreal] During a news conference, 
Calderon Sol has decried the 24 February machine gunning of 
Nidia Diaz's vehicle that left her driver wounded. He has said 
these actions are very distressful, especially a few days before 
the elections. 
  [Calderon Sol] We believe that violence is a thing of the 
past, that our country has overcome these violent acts, and that 
the Salvadoran people are tired of and reject violence. They do 
not even want verbal abuse, much less physical violence. We 
regret, decry, and reject this action. We want a thorough 
investigation. 
  [Villarreal] Calderon Sol has abstained from saying whether 
this new action against an FMLN [Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front] leader has political connotations; instead, he 
has called for an investigation, as was done in previous cases 
when political leaders were the targets of similar attacks. 
  [Calderon Sol] I would not like to make assumptions, because 
I believe making assumptions regarding delicate matters when one 
lacks information is dangerous and irresponsible. What we need 
to do is investigate and bring the perpetrators to justice. 
  [Villarreal] The Arena presidential candidate has called on 
the joint group that is investigating the illegal armed groups 
to include in its reports the attacks against politicians, 
regardless of whether they are from the right, left, or any 
other ideology. [end recording]

passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani on 25 February condemned 
the attack on Nidia Diaz, FMLN [Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front] leader, in which her driver was wounded. 
Although former rebel leaders blamed the death squads, 
Cristiani said that, for the time being, no one can be blamed, 
but added that certain aspects of this case deserve 
investigation. 
  [Cristiani] "The Interinstitutional Commission [to Prevent 
and Combat Crime] was instructed on 24 February to start 
investigating immediately to try to determine the reasons for 
this attack." 
  The head of state also pointed out that a similar attack on 
the husband of an Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance] deputy 
is being investigated. Meanwhile, he downplayed the threats 
made by former armed forces members to boycott the upcoming 
elections and to carry out violent actions from Guazapa. 
  [Cristiani] "We do not understand why they are swaggering at 
this time when they are well aware that the timetable that was 
agreed upon is being followed." Cristiani said that if these 
threats materialize, the government will take appropriate steps. 
  [Cristiani] "We would have to fight them. If Guazapa greets 
them with open arms, the PNC [National Civilian Police] will be 
waiting for them too. 
  [Unidentified reporter] "Mr. President, they claim to have 
weapons. 
  [Cristiani] "If they want to use them, we will have to take 
them away." 
  The president said that beginning in March, former military 
men will receive their first payment in keeping with the 
timetable agreed upon. He also pointed out that this commitment 
pertains only to those who meet the requirements established to 
indemnify the demobilized.

  [Text] Dozens of demobilized Armed Forces members have 
threatened to take up arms and obstruct the elections if the 
government does not compensate them as the peace agreements 
establish. 
  On its part, the government has charged that the former 
soldiers are being "manipulated" by those who want to create 
problems for the election process. Pedro Martinez, of the 
Association of Demobilized Armed Forces Members [Asociacion de 
Desmovilizados de la Fuerza Armada -- Adefaes], said "we could 
obstruct the elections. We have demobilized personnel in all 
the departments and we could easily block streets and prevent 
access to polling stations." 
  The demobilized soldiers yesterday gathered in front of the 
offices of the Armed Forces Social Welfare Institute (IPSFA), 
located at No. 6a-10a, Poniente Street, near the National 
Gymnasium. "We are told to present ourselves, but when we do so, 
they write in our documents that we were discharged because we 
are guilty of some irregularity in our service or we went AWOL 
and they refuse to grant us our rights," the former soldiers 
said. "We have warned the government and the Armed Forces that 
we will not permit being denied compensation." "We will go to 
Guazapa Hill [site of fighting during the armed conflict]." "We 
are going to take reprisals against all those who oppose our 
compensation process. We are going to take reprisals against 
the colonels and the officers who are declaring themselves our 
enemies," the former soldiers warned. 
  Presidency Minister Oscar Santamaria yesterday warned that 
if 
the former soldiers carry out their threats, the law will be 
enforced against them.

  [Text] The government is forming paramilitary groups to 
insert them into labor movements demanding wage increases so as 
to create destabilization, Luis Lara, leader of the National 
Assembly of Health Workers, stated on 27 February. 
  We know of the government's intentions to arm paramilitary 
groups to hinder the movement, but we will remain alert, Lara 
added. 
  Lara was interviewed while heading a protest march. He also 
said the National Assembly of Health Employees will conduct an 
analytical and scientific study to determine the causes of the 
death of patient Miriam Catalina Rodriguez de Alvizurez outside 
the emergency ward of Roosevelt Hospital. 
  Lara said he agrees with other union leaders who have said 
the president of the Republic and the Army commanding general 
are directly responsible for the patient's death.

  [Text] Attorney General Telesforo Guerra Cahn has charged: 
"A well-known political party and radical groups are plotting 
against the executive to weaken it to the extreme of creating 
total anarchy." 
  The attorney general has referred to the strike of 
government 
professionals and bureaucrats during the past days. He has said 
it was a clear example of the plan being implemented by the 
mentioned sectors, which, by the way, have not agreed to 
negotiate with executive representatives. 
  When one studies seriously the actions taken to end the 
strike of the workers, who are demanding a wage increase, you 
will notice there have been several officials who have disobeyed 
the president's orders, Guerra has stated. 
  He has cited the case of the San Juan de Dios Hospital 
directors who have refused to comply with the law and write the 
corresponding reports against the striking workers and, in 
addition, have decided to resign as a whole. This, he has said, 
is evidence they are being manipulated by the destabilizing 
groups I have mentioned. 
  The attorney general has said the decisions made lately by 
many judges is another act included in the plot. The rulings 
attempt to mock government officials who have started actions to 
get work to advance in the proper legal framework. 
  Although the health workers and those in the municipal 
cemetery were acting illegally, a judge ordered their release 
last week and opened a criminal case against representatives of 
the Attorney General's Office, he has reported. 
  Guerra has also said a judge had rejected the charges 
presented against the strikers who occupied the National Palace. 
Obviously, he said, an illegal action was committed there. 
Furthermore, an amparo was presented to order the bureaucrats 
to reinitiate the rendering of basic services to the public, 
and, up to now, nothing has been resolved on this issue. 
  Attorney General Guerra has said he believed there is an 
attempt to weaken the government's authority and to confuse 
public opinion to get it to believe there is a power vacuum.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 1 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- More than 
100,000 Guatemalan Government employees, members of the Union of 
Government Workers (IUTE), have been on a partial strike for a 
month now to press for a 40-percent salary increase. 
  IUTE leader Luis Lara told EFE that the health, education, 
roads, and public works workers, among others, will not lift the 
strike until the government meets their demands. The government 
workers have turned down an annual bonus of 360 quetzales 
(approximately $62) that President Ramiro de Leon offered them 
to lift the strike. 
  One union leader said, "We want our basic salaries raised, 
not bonuses that will not help us resolve our economic 
problems." In view of this, De Leon announced that the economic 
cabinet will present a new proposal to the workers, but he 
warned he will not issue currency without backing. 
  Finance Minister Ana de Molina said the new proposal will be 
directed at the National Federation of Public Employees 
(Fenasep), which is not on strike and which has been negotiating 
with the government for pay raises since last week. De Molina 
also announced that, beginning in March, the government will 
withhold the striking workers' salaries for the days they remain 
on strike. 
  Hector Luna Troccoli, secretary general of the Presidency, 
has admitted that the government workers' salaries are low, but 
he said the government has failed to raise the salaries not 
because it does not want to meet their demands, but because 
there is no money. 
  In addition, Alberto Villar, a leader of the National 
Federation of Unions of Guatemalan Government Workers (Fenasteg) 
told EFE that some 70,000 Fenasteg workers have lifted their 
strike to give the government a chance to reconsider its 
position. Villar warned, however, that if De Leon refuses to 
discuss their demands, the organization does not rule out the 
possibility of calling for another nationwide strike to pressure 
the government. "We are waiting for the government to invite us 
to negotiate the pay raise," the union leader said. He added 
that, although the strike has been partially lifted, the demand 
for a 40 percent pay raise stands. 
  The strike was also called to reject the government's plans 
to privatize several public institutions, such as the electric 
energy sector and hospitals, and to demand a larger budget for 
education and health. 
  Villar said the president so far has not shown political 
willingness to resolve the labor crisis in the government. He 
said his group plans to demonstrate in Guatemala City today to 
demand serious talks with De Leon who, nevertheless, has advised 
he will not sit down to talk without any sector because of 
pressure. The president has also rejected the mediation of the 
Catholic Church and the Central American Parliament in seeking a 
resolution to the labor crisis.

<F P=106> [Interview with Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio </F>
by Evelyn Blanck: "I Would Say the Lion Roared Again;" place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] On 18 February, in a climate of tension generated by 
persistent rumors concerning his resignation or a possible 
attack on him, the president disclosed important changes within 
his security cabinet. Among those dismissed was General Jose 
Luis Quilo Ayuso, chief of the General Staff of National 
Defense, a key position within the Armed Forces. 
  [Blanck] You have said that recent changes within the 
security cabinet will strengthen the country's institutionality 
and foster unity within the Armed Forces. Why? 
  [De Leon] I know where you are coming from. The rumors that 
have circulated over the past few days concerning a coup d'etat 
are just that; rumors. No attempt has ever been made to disrupt 
constitutional order as in May 1988; there have only been 
reports concerning movements against the government. All of 
this has taken place outside the Army and although an attempt 
was made to approach the military, it did not succeed. 
  [Blanck] Over the past few days more has been said 
concerning 
the involvement of several civilians in a conspiracy against you 
rather than of a coup attempt. A vice presidential adviser, a 
Parlacen [Central American Parliament] deputy and a former 
president have been mentioned. Will you prosecute them? 
  [De Leon] If we had names and dates we would have taken them 
to court already because we would be dealing with actions 
classified as crimes under the Penal Code. However, we are 
dealing with rumors that may be well founded. It is said that 
certain individuals who have a coupist calling have participated 
in these activities and there is evidence that they have spoken 
with one another. What we do not have is evidence against them. 
In fact, the resignation of one of the persons you mentioned, 
Fernando Andrade Diaz-Duran, was accepted on that same Friday. 
The message we are sending is very clear. 
  [Blanck] Doesn't the dismissal of Gen. Jose Luis Quilo Ayuso 
close the chapter initiated with the departure of General Jose 
Domingo Garcia Samayoa in mid-1993? 
  [De Leon] Top Army commanders were dismissed after 25 May 
because they led the Armed Forces during a regime that ended 
with the disruption of constitutional order. In the case of 
Gen. Quilo Ayuso, he was removed because a new policy had to be 
coordinated. It was a decision of state for purposes of state. 
  [Blanck] However, this coordination comes eight months after 
you took office. Isn't that a long time? 
  [De Leon] The first mandate I received from the Guatemalan 
people was to consolidate the country institutionally. The 
changes that were made during the first phase of this mandate 
are the result of this. Furthermore, during the course of these 
months there was also a battle to purge state institutions, 
which concluded with the referendum. Having done this I thought 
it necessary to move one man to achieve consolidation. Yes, 
eight months have passed, but the president in his capacity as 
commander of the Army, used them to become acquainted with the 
situation. 
  [Blanck] What do you expect from Gen. Marco Antonio 
Gonzalez Taracena, the new chief of staff for Defense? 
  [De Leon] Excellent coordination with the defense minister. 
I expect Gen. Taracena to transmit the High Command's way of 
thinking to the officers with his leadership. Also, I have told 
him and the minister that from now on I will work more closely 
with the High Command and involve myself with reality. This 
does not mean that I will encroach on them, but rather that I 
will engage more in problems dealing with the Armed Forces. I 
met with them on Saturday and asked them for a list of the 
Army's problems. 
  [Blanck] Did Gen. Quilo Ayuso maintain the coordination you 
speak about with the defense minister? 
  [De Leon] There have been rumors of a disagreement between 
the defense minister and Gen. Ayuso, but this disagreement 
really did not exist. Nevertheless, an apparent division is not 
good for the Army. An institution must have leaders who are 
sure of themselves. There just cannot be any doubts that all of 
the leaders are following the same course of action. 
  [Blanck] A MIAMI HERALD article says you are restricted by a 
powerful Army. Is this true? 
  [De Leon] Quite the contrary. The changes announced on 
Friday prove the Army's support for the president. Certainly, 
military power is this government's fundamental pillar. This 
does not mean the president's militarization, however, but 
absolute support for him and this transition government. I 
would say that the lion roared again on Friday. 
  [Blanck] On Tuesday, 8 February, you reportedly told a group 
of friends you would never resign your position as president. 
Is it true? 
  [De Leon] It has never crossed my mind. Much less now, after 
the referendum, not because it represents a victory -- I do not 
want to blind myself on this -- but because this page is a 
closed chapter in history. 
  [Blanck] The climate of confrontation between Congress and 
the Executive Branch persists, however. What will happen if the 
deputies fail to make good their pledges with the Executive 
Branch? 
  [De Leon] The approved reforms are irreversible. In view of 
this reality, the political parties are aware of the risk 
involved if they fail to behave properly. This means they must 
carry out the Electoral and Political Parties Law and debate the 
three basic points: participation of civic committees, reduction 
of the number of deputies, and the supervision of the use of 
funds. We are not sure whether or not we will be able to do the 
latter. 
  [Blanck] Has a channel of communication been opened between 
the two state branches after the rapprochement between you and 
Congress President Vinicio Villar in Salama? 
  [De Leon] No, that was a chance encounter. I agree with the 
Congress president on the need for unity. I am after a Great 
National Agreement, GAN, and will talk with the political sector 
from an institutional point of view. 
  [Blanck] What about the labor union sector, which has 
refused 
to participate in GAN from the outset? 
  [De Leon] GAN began to be criticized even before its nature 
became known. What the various sectors say here is different 
from what they say out of the country, however. GAN will work 
because the various sectors have no but to reinforce the 
government and participate. Either we reach the agreement that 
history demands or else everything will go wrong. 
  [Blanck] One of the government actions that has disturbed 
the people and the trade unions more is the issue of 
privatization. How are you going to settle that? 
  [De Leon] More than privatization, I have spoken of breaking 
up monopolies, something I am determined to do because it is 
advisable for the government. I am aware that we must convince 
the unions that breaking up monopolies does not go against them. 
What the government wants in this transition period is to 
prepare the people, particularly the workers, for a new step. 
Wonderful things are coming up, such as NAFTA which will be of 
benefit to the country. NAFTA is a fact; we have not made it up. 
Guatemala is the only country neighboring the most powerful 
economic bloc in the world. That has its benefits and we must 
take advantage of them. We must make the people understand the 
benefits. We must try it, although there are some groups who do 
not like this at all. 
  [Blanck] Nonetheless, this is happening in all groups. You 
say you have attained a commitment inasmuch as the private 
sector will comply with its fiscal obligations. However, who 
guarantees this will be the case? 
  [De Leon] We have two great challenges. One is obtaining the 
revenue for meeting the goals outlined in the budget, 
particularly after the Constitutionality Court ruling which 
declared unconstitutional withholding 5 percent. That means we 
might not be able to collect 600 million quetzales. The finance 
minister has the serious and grave responsibility of achieving 
that, instead of 8 centavos, we collect 10 centavos for each 
quetzal. One of the ways to do that is to resort to private 
enterprise, with whom we are holding conversations. 
  [Blanck] And how about the other challenge. 
  [De Leon] To improve the financial situation of the state, 
which is critical. We will continue with the austerity program. 
We are also going to seek the help of friendly governments, 
availing ourselves of the fact the government enjoys credibility 
at present. Lastly, we are going to sell everything that is not 
operating well. 
  [Blanck] Does that request for help from abroad entail more 
debts? 
  [De Leon] No, I am referring to the renegotiation of the 
debt. To mention a specific case, we are about to solve the 
problem of CELGUSA [expansion unknown], as Spain has agreed to 
pardon part of the debt, at least 50 percent, without the 
government having had to pay a centavo for that renegotiation. 
  [Blanck] One last question. Your apparent indecision has 
deteriorated your image. How do you plan to counter this? 
  [De Leon] As president, I have had to make decisions, such 
as 
the one I made last Friday. Some say I am undecided because I 
did not pull the deputies by the hair or because I did not close 
Congress. I cannot do that. My problem is that my prestige as 
human rights ombudsman created great expectations with regard to 
my actions. I only hope that the decisions I make when I 
implement my policies will help me to recover my image.

<F P=106> [Report by Armando Perez; from the "News Patrol" newscast] </F>
  [Text] At San Carlos University [USAC], 130 medical school 
professors are being held hostage in the M-4 Building. Certain 
students reported that five professors managed to escape after 
breaking a window. The medical students said that the conflict 
worsened when professors claimed they had been kidnapped. The 
students denied this. One thousand students are inside the M-4 
Building of the USAC Medical School. They cannot leave because 
the building's two metal doors are locked with several padlocks. 
  The negotiations continue but there as yet is no solution to 
the student conflict that broke out on 1 March, three weeks 
after the professors of the USAC Medical School first stopped 
teaching any classes, the affected students said. This was a 
report for our listeners. Back to the studios. 
  [Announcer] Thank you very much, Armando Perez. We have a 
question for you. The Roda family wants to know whether you and 
Lucia Dubon could look into the status of Dr. Judith Garcia de 
Roda. I repeat her name, Dr. Judith Garcia de Roda, who is among 
the professors who is being held. Her family in Zone Seven is 
worried. Do you know anything about the professors who are 
currently being held? Go ahead, Armando. 
  [Perez] There was an assembly on 1 March of Medical School 
students and professors, however, given that no solution was 
reached, the students occupied the Medical School's M-4 
building. So far no one has been allowed inside this building 
because it is locked. Students and professors are negotiating 
in an attempt to solve the conflict that started on 1 March. 
  The students reported that five professors managed to escape 
from the building after breaking a window and about 130 
professors are still inside. Negotiations continue and the 
situation is rather calm. It is expected, however, that there 
could be a solution to the conflict at a given time, as I said 
before, because the professors have not taught classes for more 
than three weeks, and the students decided to adopt this 
measure, because USAC authorities failed to react to this 
situation.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 1 Mar (DPA) -- It was officially 
reported today that the Guatemalan Foreign Ministry will send a 
formal note to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
expressing Guatemala's interest in solving the 100-year-old 
territorial dispute with Belize through negotiations or 
international legal procedures. 
  Guatemalan Foreign Minister Gladys Marithza Ruiz de Vielman 
said that "in order to safeguard Guatemala's rights regarding 
Belize," the Ministry decided to send the note to the UN 
secretary general, "with the appropriate reservations regarding 
the territorial sea, the exclusive economic zone, and 
continental shelf, so that it can be circulated as an official 
document of the United Nations." 
  The government of Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio 
maintains claims over the territory of Belize (23,000 square 
km), which Great Britain unilaterally granted independence on 21 
September 1981. Jorge Serrano Elias, the previous president who 
was ousted on 1 June 1993, recognized Belize and established 
diplomatic relations. Various Guatemalan sectors, including 
Human Rights Ombudsman Jorge Mario Garcia Laguardia, have said 
this was unconstitutional. 
  Moreover, because the border between the two countries has 
not been well defined, some incidents have occurred. The 
Guatemalan Foreign Ministry reported that the Belizean 
Government has affirmed that a group of Guatemalans allegedly 
settled in Belizean territory. This is being investigated by the 
Guatemalan Government. 
  Human Rights Ombudsman Garcia Laguardia has asked for the 
immediate intervention of the Guatemalan Army to protect 
Guatemalan territory, after he personally learned of the threats 
that Belizean soldiers have issued against 35 families in the 
town of Rio Hondo in northern Peten Department, on the border 
with Belize. The ombudsman met with local peasants who provided 
details of the threats. Garcia Laguardia called for strict 
control and surveillance of the border area by the Army to 
guarantee the rights of the Guatemalans.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Guatemalan economic developments monitored through 1 
March. 
  Banco del Cafe, Inc. and the Central American Bank of 
Economic Integration (BCIE) recently signed a loan agreement for 
$1 million for projects to bolster production activities of 
agricultural enterprises, industries, tourism, and small and 
medium-sized businesses. This is the fourth loan signed with 
Banco del Cafe in less than a year, thereby bringing total 
financing to $5.5 million. (Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in 
Spanish 22 Feb 94 p 63) 
  In its most recent meeting, the Monetary Board favored the 
terms of negotiations on the public and private foreign debts 
with the Paris Club. After analyzing the contents of the 
agreements with creditor countries, the Monetary Board concluded 
that the terms will not adversely affect the balance of payments 
or the money in circulation in the country. Willy Zapata, 
president of the Central Bank and the Monetary Board, noted that 
the negotiations are in their final phase and that it is 
estimated that they will conclude in late March. Because of the 
crisis of the 1980's, the country was left without reserves and 
was forced to suspend its foreign debt payments. Last year, it 
was allowed to renegotiate its overdue debts through 
negotiations with the Paris Club. In these renegotiations, the 
creditor countries gave Guatemala 20 years to pay its debt with 
a 10-year grace period. "This means that Guatemala will begin 
paying its debt in the year 2003," Zapata remarked. (Guatemala 
City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 25 Feb 94 p 91) 
  Today, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) will 
disburse $62 million from a loan that is part of a program to 
modernize the financial sector. With this second disbursement, 
the amount the IDB has given Guatemala totals $122 million of 
the $132 million in loans agreed upon. The remaining $10 
million will be disbursed within a few months. The 
modernization program is aimed at making credit to Guatemalans 
more readily available through the banks. It also seeks "to 
expand the operations of the national financial system to 
promote capital flow and credit to all sectors and to people who 
want to participate in the country's development." (Guatemala 
City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 28 Feb 94 p 147)

  [Editorial Report] Honduran Central Bank President Daniel 
Figueroa has announced that the legal reserve, the highest in 
Central America, has been reduced from 36 to 34 percent for the 
banking system and from 17 to 15 percent for savings and loan 
associations. This reduction will release approximately $15.1 
million into the system and lead to lower interest rates. 
Figueroa said the government intends to keep lowering the legal 
reserve down to between 20 and 25 percent to make it 
competitive. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0119 GMT 18 Feb 94)

  [Editorial Report] Mariano Buitrago, the National 
Development Bank, BANADES, deputy general finance manager, has 
reported to BARRICADA that one of the main reasons why producers 
could not repay their loans on schedule in the past crop cycle 
is that the producers found no buyers. Consequently, the bank 
has proposed a plan whereby producers would store their crops in 
silos specially prepared by BANADES. A Certificate of Deposit, 
with a Guarantee Certificate in favor of BANADES attached, would 
be issued in the producer's name. Because the producer requires 
some time to market his crop, BANADES will take the Guarantee 
Certificate and issue Finance Certificates that would be offered 
to private banks at competitive rates. Private banks will buy 
the Finance Certificate. The BANADES loan portfolio thus would 
become healthy and money would be available either to finance 
the industrial plants willing to buy the production or to help 
producers find their own ways of marketing their crops, in or 
outside the country while the new production cycle is in 
progress.

<F P=106> [Proposal by Coordinating Committee of the Sandinist </F>
Democratic Left (Pikin Guerrero); first paragraph is committee's 
introduction] 
  [Text] This month, as we commemorate the 60th anniversary 
of the assassination of Augusto Cesar Sandino and anticipate the 
Special Congress of the Sandinist National Liberation Front 
(FSLN), in keeping with the mandate of the Sandinist Assembly 
and the membership's desire to reflect on and debate more 
thoroughly the nature of our party and the future of the nation, 
we are making our contribution to the program specifications and 
helping to enrich the discussion at all levels and in all 
sectors of Sandinism. 
<H5>  Rule of Law, Social Justice, and Humanist Socialism </H5>
  The FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] considers 
itself a revolutionary party whose fundamental objective is to 
struggle and work, in the short and medium term, for the 
establishment of the Rule of Law, Social Justice, and a Humanist 
and Democratic Socialism that will place the individual, the 
family, and the community at the center of its concerns. In this 
regard, the FSLN rejects the principles and measures of 
liberalism and neoliberalism as a solution to the political, 
social, and economic problems of Nicaraguan society. 
  The FSLN's aspiration and proposal for all of Nicaraguan 
society is to move gradually and progressively toward a humanist 
socialism in which the rule of law would combine with social 
justice and political and economic democracy, and popular 
organizations and sectors could achieve real participation in 
the political and economic power of the Nicaraguan nation. To 
achieve these objectives, the FSLN must ally itself with all 
those who are interested in eliminating the dictatorial and 
caudillist tendencies in politics and the concentrating and 
exclusive tendencies in the economy, which still prevail in 
Nicaraguan capitalist society. 
  The FSLN promotes relationships of respect and mutual 
benefit, as well as peaceful coexistence with the neighboring 
governments and peoples of Central America and the Caribbean, 
and particularly with the United States. 
  The FSLN makes common cause with the peoples of Latin 
America 
and the Caribbean in the defense of self-determination and 
national sovereignty. 
<H5>  Political Power </H5>
  The nation's sovereignty resides in the Nicaraguan people. 
  The people are the source of political power, and this power 
is expressed not only in the state apparatus and government 
institutions, but also in the institutions and organizations of 
civil society: trade associations; labor unions; churches; 
municipalities; associations of students, women, professionals 
and artists, and ethnic groups; cultural, agroecological, 
sports, and youth organizations; and nongovernment agencies in 
general. 
  The FSLN must stimulate the creation and democratic 
development of local, municipal, territorial, and associative 
power, without any sort of exclusion. 
  The FSLN considers the officers, petty officers, and 
enlisted 
men of the Army and the police to be the fruit of the RPS 
[expansion not given], and it encourages the subordination of 
their institutions to respect for human rights, the 
Constitution, and the laws of the Republic. 
<H5>  Political Democracy </H5>
  The legitimacy of political power lies in the general 
representation of the citizenry and the participation of all 
existing organizations in civil society. 
  The FSLN respects and democratically strengthens the 
institutions and political values that are most representative 
of national culture: administrative honesty, universal suffrage, 
the separation of powers, and national sovereignty and 
independence. It discourages, questions, and opposes any 
exclusive political culture. 
  As a democratic party, the FSLN represents all sectors of 
the 
Nicaraguan nation, without regard for race, religion, class, 
sex, ethnic group, or political position, who are struggling for 
peace, stability, security, and the political rights of all 
Nicaraguans. As a revolutionary party, the FSLN is striving to 
achieve real social participation in the realms and institutions 
of civil society and the national government, especially on the 
part of labor and popular sectors in general, and the rest of 
the dispossessed sectors of Nicaragua. 
  The FSLN respects, promotes, and develops civic methods for 
enriching the participation of the citizenry and of popular 
organizations in demanding respect for their political, social, 
economic, and cultural rights. 
  The FSLN defends the individual security and liberty of all 
Nicaraguans against the abuses of the government or any other 
national or international body. 
  The FSLN promotes full autonomy for the ethnic peoples and 
communities of the Atlantic coast. 
  The FSLN acknowledges the gender demands that the Nicaraguan 
feminist movement has been putting forth, and it struggles for 
the complete elimination of the discrimination that women 
suffer, and for their participation at all levels of national 
and party activity. 
<H5>  Economic, Social, and Cultural Democracy </H5>
  As a democratic party, the FSLN represents all sectors who 
are seeking national economic development and social justice. As 
a revolutionary party, it particularly represents the popular 
forces, midlevel sectors, professionals, intellectuals, and 
artists who want their fair share in the distribution of 
national wealth. 
  The FSLN rejects any position that promotes the restoration 
of the oligarchic regime, such as the exclusive and neoliberal 
policies that lead to social contradictions, conflicts, and 
instability. 
  The FSLN respects public and private property, as well as 
any 
other form of property; it struggles for the democratization of 
property ownership, and promotes and encourages all forms of 
associative property ownership: communal, cooperative, Workers' 
Property Area (APT), associative enterprises, municipal, 
autonomous and labor union, federative, and mixed. 
  The FSLN struggles to democratize the economy, striving to 
ensure that it will respond to the majorities, not the 
minorities, that its competitiveness is not oligopolistic, that 
it is based on ethical and popular criteria rather than 
demagogic moralities, that it is monitored by society and the 
state without distorting its role in the effective and 
productive allocation of resources, and that it is an economy 
that favors human resources rather than capital. 
  The FSLN promotes those economic policies that are aimed at 
productive growth, that involve distribution according to the 
work and productivity of each person, within the areas to which 
society and individual initiative consign them, and that give 
priority to providing employment, health, education, and housing. 
  The FSLN develops all possible initiatives and measures to 
reduce the poverty and unemployment that plague the majority of 
Nicaraguan people. 
  The FSLN struggles to gain access to the minimum conditions 
for a decent life for all individuals who, for reasons of age, 
sex, or physical disability cannot enjoy the general amenities 
of society. 
  The FSLN draws fundamental inspiration from the historical 
and cultural roots of the Nicaraguan people in its search for 
the economic model that is most beneficial to the nation as a 
whole, and to the impoverished majority in particular. 
  The FSLN struggles to preserve the national ecosystem, 
promoting all technical and cultural practices that strengthen 
the conservation, improvement, and maintenance of our resources. 
  The FSLN encourages economic policies that favor all social 
sectors, particularly rural and urban producers: democratization 
of credit, investment opportunities, and trade and financial 
information, for producers, workers, and consumers. It also 
promotes policies that deter capital flight and asset stripping. 
  The FSLN uses all possible influences, both nationally and 
internationally, to make sure that the state oversees national 
economic development and regulates the social distribution of 
wealth. 
<H5>  Party Organization </H5>
  The FSLN is a party that is open to all sectors of 
Nicaraguan 
society, and it aspires to represent, from the opposition or in 
the government, society as a whole, in the search for democracy, 
economic development, and social justice. It places the poor and 
the unemployed, who are the majority of Nicaraguans, at the 
center of its concerns. 
  The FSLN is a revolutionary, democratic, and participative 
party that struggles to reconcile individual initiative and 
freedom with the interests of the organization and the 
philosophical principles that guide it. 
  The FSLN is a party that promotes national and international 
political alliances with other parties with a view to achieving 
the objectives of the social and economic well-being of society 
as a whole, and the popular sectors in particular. 
  The FSLN is a party that respects the autonomy and interests 
of social and popular organizations, backs their demands and 
their struggles, and tries to attract them to its philosophy. 
  The FSLN is a broad and democratic party where there is room 
for all citizens who accept its philosophical principles, 
respect for Sandinist unity, and majority decisions. 
  The FSLN is a party that promotes consensus among its 
members, using discussion and dialogue as a means of resolving 
internal conflicts. 
  The FSLN favors renewal, modernization, change, and internal 
democracy as ways of strengthening Sandinism from the left. 
<H5>  Methods of Struggle </H5>
  The FSLN considers the methods of parliamentary and legal 
struggle, popular mobilization, and public debate to be a 
legitimate combination. 
  The FSLN considers that the struggles of any popular 
organization should be based on the broadest consensus of the 
rank and file as well as the support, coordination, and 
solidarity of related organizations, and should include among 
their objectives and procedures the persuasion of the populace 
in order to incorporate it into their demands. 
  The FSLN considers information, education, and humanist 
instruction to be the fundamental instrument for nourishing the 
political, social, and economic ethics of Sandinists and of 
Nicaraguans in general. 
  The FSLN considers direct, secret, and universal suffrage to 
be a legitimate method of struggle in campaigns for municipal 
and parliamentary office and for the presidency, as well as any 
other national or party office.

  [Text] Jose Salvador Munoz, presidential candidate for the 
Doctrinaire Panamenist Party (PPD), warned yesterday that the 
presence of U.S. forces in Panama has been the cause of the 
constant conflicts between the United States and our country. 
"The foreign military force in our fatherland has been the 
cause of conflict and permanent disturbance in our relations 
with the United States, and I think we must not continue having 
those bases," Munoz added. Munoz pointed out to LA ESTRELLA DE 
PANAMA that the approximately 5,000 workers employed on the U.S. 
military bases cannot decide on the economic future of the 
country. 
  "The canal belongs to Panama," Munoz emphasized while adding 
that the proximity of the date on which the United States will 
return to Panama the waterway and the property that is needed 
has led to "some sort of a race and fight to see who is going to 
get part" of the same. 
  He criticized those persons who have asked at one time or 
another for the military bases to stay and described this as "a 
humiliation, a disillusion, and a shame." Munoz, 63, is a 
lawyer and a pilot. His running mates are Rodrigo Bernal and 
Julia Suira, as candidates for the first and second vice 
presidency, respectively. According to the politician, the 
renegotiation of bases "does not at all lessen the merits of 
Panamanian nationality," but in order for that to occur the two 
parties must be in agreement, after having vacated them under 
equal conditions. [sentence as published]

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Panama's economic developments monitored through 1 
March. 
  Planning and Economic Policy Minister Delia Cardenas has 
reported that commercial banks have finally realized that Panama 
does not have the money needed to pay its foreign debt, which 
amounts to approximately $3 billion. A Panamanian delegation 
met in the United States 17-18 February with the committee of 
creditor banks to negotiate on the debt. Cardenas refused to 
give details of Panama's proposal. (Panama City LA PRENSA in 
Spanish 23 Feb 94 p 3A) 
  Planning and Economic Policy Minister Delia Cardenas, when 
discussing the alleged imbalance in public financial figures, 
said: "What has happened is that fiscal 1993 closed with a 
surplus which, according to the comptroller general, amounted to 
$16 million versus $40 million, according to our figures. These 
differences always take place and can be worked out during 
1994." She added that the difference is due to the fact that 
her ministry works with estimates. (Panama City Circuito RPC 
Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 25 Feb 94) 
  The Association of Panamanian Industrialists (SIP) reported 
a 
drop in the export of Panamanian manufactured products to the 
United States from $102.8 million in 1992 to $58.3 million in 
1993. The SIP report adds that these exports continue to 
decline, but it gives no reason. There are, however, cases 
where the actual amounts of exports have increased, while the 
amount of income has diminished. In terms of chemical products, 
quantities sold increased 69 percent, but income from sales of 
these products declined 9 percent. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE 
PANAMA in Spanish 26 Feb 94 p 24) 
  Alvaro Aleman, the Finance Ministry's director general for 
revenues, has reported that during 1994 his office expects to 
collect $898 million in taxes and $415 million from other 
sources, $65 million more than last year. (Panama City LA 
ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 28 Feb 94 p 2A)

  [Excerpt] La Paz, 1 Mar (EFE) -- The Bolivian Government 
today released the third official version of Spanish citizen 
Manuel Ramon Puchol's death in the city of San Matias on 10 
February. The government said Puchol committed suicide, despite 
a police report and a witness who say that Puchol died as a 
result of a savage beating by a group of military men. 
  Local officials have been putting together an official 
version of Puchol's death for the past few days. Meanwhile, the 
in situ investigation of the case, which is being closely 
followed by Spanish Ambassador Fernando Martinez Westerhausen, 
has begun in San Matias. 
  Before the beginning of the investigation promised by 
Bolivian authorities, and 20 days after Puchol's death, Interior 
Under Secretary Hugo San Martin said he was "convinced that a 
suicide, and not a murder, occurred in San Matias." 
  The new Bolivian Government version contradicts the police 
report that said Puchol died as a result of a beating by a group 
of military men, the testimony of a witness who confirmed the 
report, and the pictures in the hands of the Spanish Embassy, in 
which Puchol is seen with clear marks of violence over his 
entire body. 
  San Martin talked with ANF [Fides News Agency], but did not 
say how is it possible for a person to commit suicide and end up 
with double encephalic traumatism, cranial crushing, and 
extensive hematomas throughout the body, as was indicated by the 
autopsy. Puchol, 33, was born in Alicante and worked in Justice 
Ministry prisons. 
  The under secretary defended the official theory of Puchol's 
suicide before Spanish Ambassador to Bolivia Fernando Martinez 
Westerhausen, with whom he traveled to San Matias, where the 
Spanish citizen died on 10 February. 
  Bolivian authorities and the embassies of Spain and the 
United Kingdom in La Paz did not report on the whereabouts of 
Douglas James Morrison, a resident of San Matias, who testified 
to having witnessed the beating by the military shortly before 
Puchol died. EFE learned that Morrison disappeared after 
requesting the protection of the two diplomatic missions.

  [Text] The FIDES news agency managed to interview Isaac 
Chavarria in his high security cell in Chonchocoro. Mr. 
Chavarria revealed some very important things. Breathing oxygen 
from two cylinders next to his bed, he said: As Jaime Paz 
Zamora's stalwart and loyal man, I cooperated with the political 
campaign of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left, MIR, in 
1989, and I also helped guarantee Paz Zamora's physical safety. 
He meant that he was a bodyguard. 
  He stated that rumors that the MIR leadership had received 
money from drug trafficking are false. He reaffirmed that there 
is no link between the MIR and the money obtained from drug 
trafficking. He pointed out that he did not supply any money, 
but rather his small airplane, and the physical safety that is 
worth more than $100 million [sentence as heard]. 
  He added: I protected a man who had been in a plane crash, 
and it was my job to help him arrive at his destination alive. 
He said: It is completely unfair to hold me in this prison. He 
pointed out that he was a victim of a political plot to harm 
important personalities. 
  About a picture of Paz Zamora and Chavarria, known as the 
narcophoto, and which was published during the former 
Nationalist Revolutionary Movement's administration, Chavarria 
said: On that occasion I stood beside him to open the door of 
the plane. 
  This is a long interview, of which only some of the most 
important points were excerpted. Chavarria insisted that he 
want to confront Meco Dominguez to refute his charges, 
especially against the MIR leaders.

  [Text] It has been reported in Santa Cruz that the Special 
Antinarcotics Force has arrested more than 35 drug traffickers, 
most of them Colombians who operated in the outskirts of San 
Jose de Chiquitos. 
  The forces destroyed a laboratory that processed 450 kg of 
cocaine per week, and seized weapons including M-16 automatic 
rifles, shotguns, revolvers, and rifles. They are also 
confiscated automobiles and houses owned by the drug traffickers 
in the city of Santa Cruz. 
  It has also been reported that from 20 to 30 top Colombian 
drug traffickers linked to the Medellin and Cali cartels could 
be operating in Bolivia. They enter or leave Bolivia time after 
time as tourists going across the border with Brazil.

<F P=106> [Interview with Agrarian Federation head Humberto Volando by </F>
Mario Burgueno Hoese; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The head of the Argentine Agrarian Federation (FAA) 
spoke with LA PRENSA and presented a detailed analysis of the 
current situation in the national agriculture-livestock sector. 
  [Burgueno Hoese] In your meeting last Tuesday with Minister 
Cavallo and the other leaders of the key entities in the sector, 
was a solution found for the matter of the regional economies on 
that crowded agenda? 
  [Volando] You said it yourself. The agenda was very crowded, 
a very long list of issues, all of them urgent and very 
important. So the time we had to talk to Dr. Cavallo and his 
advisers was utilized to the fullest. As for the regional 
economies, we have made little or no progress. The only progress 
we made was on the issue of the self-employment funds to which 
farmers must contribute for their retirement. In the regional 
economies, perhaps 5 percent of farmers are "up to date," and 
the others owe an average of five years. 
  We were able to convince Dr. Cavallo, with respect to the 
regional economies as well as the rest of the farm sector, that 
the unpaid debt is absolutely impossible to pay. In view of this 
situation, we sought a pragmatic solution: the debt incurred 
prior to 25 January 1994 is set aside, and may in time be 
forgiven. 
  [Burgueno Hoese] Should that be understood as a cancellation 
of the debt? 
  [Volando] From the legal point of view, you will not find 
any 
resolution or decree canceling that debt in the next few days. 
This is a "de facto" situation that may in the future be 
canceled by decree to give the sector some legal certainty. For 
the time being, this is a "de facto" situation in which the 
minister and his advisers gave their word in our presence. 
Moreover, agriculture-livestock producers must begin 
straightening out their situation with respect to the 
self-employment fund. In other words, beginning in February, 
they should make their monthly contributions to the fund to 
prepare for their retirement. 
  To help the farmer, this week the categories will be 
changed--right now there are several--to reverse an error that 
has existed for a long time. 
  The change in categories has already been partially agreed 
to 
at the technical levels. Thus, the farmer will contribute less 
to the fund than he does now. 
  As a counterpart to this, since there is no such thing as a 
free lunch, the self-employed agriculture-livestock producer 
will not retire simply as a function of his age (65 years), but 
he will also have to have 20 years of contributions [deportes], 
even if he has to wait until he is 80 to retire. This solution 
is not ideal, but we have not been able to find any other 
alternative. 
  [Burgueno Hoese] With regard to Buenos Aires Province, which 
is very influential in the FAA, what is your organization's 
position on the tax issue? 
  [Volando] We have been able to forestall increases in the 
Buenos Aires Province property tax in 1992 and 1993, and, 
practically speaking, in 1994. This is a veritable triumph in 
itself, since we have seen in all the provinces that it requires 
a tremendous struggle to prevent increases, and in many cases we 
have not been successful. In Buenos Aires Province we have 
managed to freeze any increases and extend payments over 96 
months for farmers who are in arrears on their taxes. This is 
not a controversial issue for the FAA. The tax on gross income, 
however, is a controversy. It applies to many activities, 
including the agriculture-livestock sector. Buenos Aires 
Province has not decided whether to eliminate it, or at least 
reduce it. Talks are being held, and despite the resistance, I 
am optimistic that it will be reduced for the farm sector. 
  [Burgueno Hoese] Changing the subject, can it be said that 
the National Service for Animal Health (Senasa) is guilty of 
negligence for what happened in the Bariloche area, and the 
resultant application of the rifle sanitario 
[destroying animals for health reasons]? 
  [Volando] You have used the right word: "negligence." The 
current vaccination plan is good in principle, but it requires a 
great deal of perseverance and strict enforcement. During the 
past few years, there has been monitoring of vaccinations in 
laboratories, monitoring of the way vaccinations are given, 
massive vaccinations, etc. With all the excitement about the new 
advancements, there has been negligence. 
  Why have there been these foci in the area of Bariloche, 
Conesa, Viedma, and Patagones? Because the ban on transporting 
livestock on the hoof or meat on the bone across the Colorado 
River has been ignored. 
  There is a lot of meat smuggling going on. The Senasa is to 
blame for that, but not exclusively. The previous head of the 
SAGyP [expansion not given], Mr. Regunaga, had agreed with Rio 
Negro, Neuquen, and local farmers to set up a commission to 
monitor the situation and make sure there was no livestock 
smuggling, and that has not been done. 
  Perhaps one of the reasons is the arrival of many 
well-heeled 
foreign tourists in Bariloche, who, among other things, want to 
have a nice steak. You know that a proper steak must have the 
meat on the bone. So there is quite a large demand, which is 
even reflected in the price of cattle. Prices have improved a 
great deal south of the Colorado River. 
  Officials have "looked the other way" when meat on the bone 
is transported, and this is how the foot-and-mouth disease virus 
has been transmitted in the area. As a result, there have been 
outbreaks that have required two treatments: vaccinated cattle 
are cordoned off in a "ring" and revaccinated. Cattle that have 
not yet been vaccinated have been decimated by foot-and-mouth 
disease, and there is no alternative but to apply the 
rifle sanitario, as other countries have done, tragic 
though it may be. 
  I would like to stress that if there had been proper 
control, 
destroying animals would be the exception rather than the rule, 
as has been the case in this episode of mass slaughter. 
  [Burgueno Hoese] What do you think of the payments farmers 
receive for the destroyed cattle? Are they fair for rural 
inhabitants? 
  [Volando] The value of the animals is determined in 
conjunction with representatives of the Senasa, of the farmers, 
and of the provinces. So far everything has gone well, because 
the prices have not been low, although the loss of profits has 
not been taken into account. The problem lies in the source of 
the funds, because the national government should be paying this 
compensation. In Carmen de Patagones and Viedma, payment was 
made within 45 days of the outbreak of infection, but the money 
came from the Senasa and the Economy Ministry has yet to 
reimburse it. In addition, people like those who operated the 
excavating equipment and those who did the slaughtering have not 
been paid anything yet. 
  So, in the case of Bariloche, the question is where the 
money 
will come from. It is a much larger amount than in the previous 
case. We are demanding that the Finance Ministry, which is the 
real payer, obey the law to the letter. 
  [Burgueno Hoese] If we add to the compensation for destroyed 
animals the $100 million that some estimate is necessary to 
convert the fruit industry in Rio Negro and Neuquen, do you 
think the Economy Ministry is in a position to deal with the two 
problems at once? 
  [Volando] No. I have personally told Minister Cavallo that. 
The conversion of the agriculture-livestock holdings (which are 
providing a lot of employment in the wet pampa region, where you 
can choose among a variety of crops or go into ranching) is 
practically impossible in the Rio Negro Valley, because wiping 
out the pear and apple orchards to switch to another product and 
waiting for the new plants to begin yielding will take 
approximately 10 years. Furthermore, the technology gap is not 
so big. I have visited laboratories where juices and nectars are 
processed for the United States, etc., and they are quite good. 
Until a few years ago, Rio Negro and Neuquen were centers of 
development, so they cannot be lumped together with other 
provinces that are considered "nonviable." Rio Negro and Neuquen 
are not; they were developing provinces, and they will be again, 
because they have the resources. What is missing is an overall 
policy to serve as a framework. 
  [Burgueno Hoese] Do you think that the new leadership of the 
National Institute of Agricultural-Livestock Technology (INTA) 
will take into account the serious problem of desertification in 
Patagonia, as the desert makes inroads into the wet pampa? 
  [Volando] I have not spoken to Mr. Huergo, nor do I know on 
what terms he agreed to accept the presidency of the INTA. What 
I do agree with is your statement that desertification is a very 
serious problem in Patagonia. In 1963, 30 years ago, I 
participated in a meat study by a commission, and at the outset 
it stated that desertification was already happening in 
Patagonia, and we still have done absolutely nothing. When the 
oil, the gas, and the sheep run out and we cannot fish anymore, 
Patagonia will be finished. 
  [Burgueno Hoese] Speaking of fishing, how did the FAA react 
to the news that the national Undersecretariat of Fishing had 
been eliminated? 
  [Volando] We have not expressed an opinion. I eat fish 
mostly 
during Holy Week, and I do not even fish as a pastime, although 
I have been concerned about it. 
  [Burgueno Hoese] Moving on to another topic, what, in your 
opinion, has been accomplished by the two programs implemented 
by the SAGyP in 1993, the Agriculture-Livestock Social Program 
and Rural Change? 
  [Volando] Rural Change, which we endorsed in a note dated 3 
March 1993, was greeted with enthusiasm and great hope by 
farmers. The plan called for 1,400 groups to be formed in 1993 
and much of 1994. In fact, the plan was surpassed, and by the 
end of last year there were already more than 1,400 groups. 
Therefore, we are avidly seeking funding so that more groups can 
be formed. This work, in addition to the mutual enrichment that 
each group will receive from the experience and the technical 
consultation from the INTA, will undoubtedly yield positive 
results. Now, the miracle of recovering lost profits within the 
framework of this current policy is not something we can expect 
of the Rural Change groups. 
  As for the social assistance aimed directly at small farmers 
in the regional economies, where there are serious problems, it 
is an expression of solidarity, aid, and sensitivity, and I 
think it is great. But handouts will not eliminate the poverty 
and backwardness of the regional economies. What needs to be 
done here is to improve and activate systems of production. 
  [Burgueno Hoese] A short time ago, you met with the head of 
the Radical Civic Union (UCR) to discuss the issue of the 
regional economies. Did that meeting produce any document 
dealing with the need to revamp the national government's policy 
on this matter? 
  [Volando] I am correcting the drafts of the guidelines we 
will submit to the UCR this week. They will explicitly state the 
changes we feel must be made at the political level to 
reactivate the regional economies. One of the first points, in 
contrast to current policy, acknowledges that Buenos Aires 
cannot dictate an overall policy for the entire country. 
Argentina is not a homogeneous country. There are several 
Argentinas. So we foresee at least five regional economies: NOA 
[expansion not given], NEA [expansion not given], Cuyo, 
Mesopotamia, and Patagonia. Each of these regions requires a 
special policy. In our view, the characteristics of each region 
must be preserved and respected in implementing policies. 
  [Burgueno Hoese] Deputy Alberti (UCR-Buenos Aires) has 
introduced an agrarian reform bill in the National Congress that 
would expropriate from its legitimate owners land in excess of 
one "economic unit." What is the FAA's position on this 
legislative proposal? 
  [Volando] From the 1930's to the mid-1970's, this was a very 
important measure. Today we see that landowning farmers, 
especially small ones, cannot subsist. So I do not think this 
proposal will have any repercussions beyond the legislator's 
intentions. I do not see it as a threat to the future. 
  [Burgueno Hoese] The FAA, the Argentine Rural Confederations 
(CRA), the Agricultural-Livestock Intercooperative Confederation 
(Coninagro), and the Argentine Rural Association (SRA) are known 
as the "mothers" of agriculture-livestock production. Do these 
four entities have a common denominator? 
  [Volando] There is a common denominator among the FAA, the 
CRA, and the Coninagro, with a few minor variations. We have 
major differences with the Argentine Rural Association, however. 
We are severely critical of this economic policy, while the SRA 
has expressed its total solidarity with the economic plan. The 
FAA considers the economic policy to be "intrinsically 
perverse," meaning that it goes beyond the intentions of its 
authors and cannot set the right course for the Republic. During 
the past three years, the conversion plan has achieved something 
we can all appreciate--stability. It has come at the cost of 
selling part of our national enterprises, sources of production, 
and even dams, something that would have been unthinkable years 
ago. Moreover, the foreign and domestic debt has grown, 
unemployment and underemployment are on the rise, and the 
balance of trade deficit is climbing as well. This policy will 
end up concentrating wealth, meaning that there will be fewer 
rich people with greater wealth and more poor people who are 
even poorer, almost destitute. 
  Recently there was a meeting of the government's social team 
to look for ways to implement an assistance plan, which I think 
is correct. But this also tells us that this policy is making it 
necessary to give food to some of our fellow citizens because 
they cannot survive on their own. 
  [Burgueno Hoese] In your relationship with Minister Cavallo, 
you have often gotten into serious verbal disputes that have 
even led to blows. How is your relationship now? 
  [Volando] Look, we are both of Italian descent, and Cavallo 
"flies off the handle" and starts shouting. No one has shouted 
at me like that except my father--and he is dead now. 
  Ours is not a personal problem; I disagree with him and he 
with me; he defends his policy and I criticize it. All of this 
causes conflicts, which are natural among passionate people. 
  [Burgueno Hoese] You say that both are of Italian descent, 
but you are both Argentine as well. Is there any point in common 
between you and the minister, besides your ethnic origin, that 
would give farmers hope for a solution to their problems? 
  [Volando] I am tremendously optimistic with regard to the 
future of the Republic. If we have not yet found the way to 
solve many of our problems, it is not for lack of human 
resources, but rather due to a deficiency in the governing class. 
  If our institutions are allowed to carry out their functions 
and the necessary debates and discussions take place, we will 
come closer to the solutions. That is why I think the results 
for the Republic will be positive in the medium term.

<F P=106> [News briefing by Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso </F>
at the Finance Ministry conference hall in Brasilia -- live] 
  [Text] I would like to thank [Labor Minister Walter] 
Barelli, [Mines and Energy] Minister Elcio Alvares, [Armed 
Forces Joint Staff Chief] Minister Arnaldo Leite Pereira, 
Secretary [General of the Presidency] Mauro Durante, [Social 
Security] Minister [Sergio] Cuotolo, [Planning Minister Alexis] 
Stepanenko, [Federal Administration Secretary Romildo] Caim, 
Attorney General of the Republic Geraldo Quintao, Messrs. 
Secretaries, presidents of government organizations, ladies and 
gentlemen, for accompanying us this afternoon. 
  A few months ago I said that I thought inflation and misery 
were the Brazilian peoples' two greatest problems. 
  Today we are taking another step in this struggle against 
inflation, so that we may continue to fight misery and be 
successful in our struggle against these two problems. 
  Every Brazilian citizen knows it is not easy. We have been 
dragging inflation with us for decades. During these past 
decades there has been a great concentration of wealth, an 
inflationary process in which those who did not have the 
economic means to make their money work were unable to protect 
their wealth, their income, their salaries, and were hardly able 
to meet their economic needs. This situation, that which had 
crystallized in Brazil, needed and needs to be reversed. 
  This is a process, a battle that must be waged by everyone. 
President Itamar Franco's government is taking the first steps. 
It has resolutely decided that instead of remaining idle, 
instead of just worrying about the current problems and those 
issues that could concern a government which, due to its own 
nature, is temporary and does not have much time, another path 
must be taken. It decided to tackle the problems from their 
roots. We have identified these two problems, that is, misery 
and inflation, and we are tackling them. It is the duty of the 
finance minister and of the ministers of the economic field, 
always following the guidelines established by the government 
and the president of the Republic, to fight inflation. But this 
does not mean that these ministers, together with the other 
ministers of the social field, should ignore the struggle to 
fight hunger, poverty, unemployment, and misery. 
  This is a convergent process. The economic field's direct 
combat front sought to reorganize the 1993 and 1994 national 
budget. I am not going to elaborate on this subject. I am 
merely going to point out that if the government spends more 
than it collects, more than it obtains from tax collection, it 
would be forced to issue papers, ask for loans, and have to pay 
high interest rates, thus becoming the main one responsible for 
nourishing the financial merry-go-round that keeps the country 
in perplexity, witnessing the great expansion of the debt at 
high interest rates and the government unable to face its most 
basic needs. It was a difficult battle which we could not have 
fought without the support of Congress. The role played by 
Congress in this struggle is essential. The government cannot 
complain. With the normal difficulties of this process, 
Congress granted us the necessary tools to fight inflation, 
starting with the budget. We reorganized the budget with great 
sacrifice from the legislators, from ministers who showed their 
solidarity. It is not easy to cut back expenditures when you 
are already working on a very tight budget. 
  Now that we can say that Brazil is starting balance things 
fiscally, we can take another step. We will start taking this 
new step tomorrow, in compliance with the provision approved by 
the president of the Republic and published in today's OFFICIAL 
GAZETTE. This step will be as difficult as the previous ones. 
But we are not seeking the easy way out. 
  We have announced each phase of the program and anticipated 
the next ones, even knowing that giving information ahead of 
time would create obstacles and reactions. But the ministers 
who are here and those who could not be here, like the 
president, and the ministers who are from areas not directly 
involved, are not afraid of obstacles, and prefer to face the 
obstacles by struggling, negotiating, and trying to win instead 
of hiding. 
  We are not going to do any magic; we are not illusionists. 
We did not lay the ground for what would have made everybody 
happy, such as an abrupt stop to inflation and eventually a 
price freeze, which also always means freezing salaries, a 
freeze that begins with prices and salaries and ends with 
salaries. That was not our path. We realized it was necessary 
for Brazil to follow a different path, a path the country as a 
whole would follow in solidarity with the struggle against 
inflation, poverty, and misery. 
  From now on the program of the Franco administration is a 
program for the country, not for a party, a candidate, a 
faction, or a class -- it is for the country. And the public 
should take into its own hands the responsibility to continue 
with this struggle; otherwise there will be no program. 
Congress was in solidarity, and some decisions will have to be 
reviewed. We need Congress not to forget to promulgate the 
Social Emergency Fund, which is a vital part of the program for 
balancing public financing. We need the solidarity and the 
understanding of Congress to be able to implement the new 
measures being taken now. 
  The important thing is not to lose our path and be 
unfaithful 
to the announcement made. There are problems. Who could not 
perceive that? Who would deny that? Certainly not the 
ministers, certainly not the president. But we decided to face 
them. Once the stage of reviewing the budget is over we must go 
into a great national dialogue, and to face a great national 
dialogue we are proposing to the Brazilian people a more stable 
and firm reference of value. Where is the Brazilian who really 
knows about relative prices? How much is a pair of shoes, a 
bicycle, a television, a car, or a house? We have to refer to 
foreign currency to have some idea of their relative value. Our 
poor cruzeiro, called real, disappears from our hands, it melts 
like ice cream, it disappears. We must again get used to having 
our prices established by a lasting unit system, and this is why 
we created the real value unit, the URV. The URV is now part of 
the monetary system, and it will serve as a fundamental basis 
for the benefit of prices and salaries, the prices of 
merchandise and salaries. And this is a very important news. 
Until now no government has ever given the workers the 
guarantee that the money he will get at the end of the month 
will have the same purchasing power the money had at the 
beginning of the month. The workers will now have that 
guarantee. 
  Now a full salary established on 1 March will have the same 
value on 1 April, based on the URV. On 1 March the minimum 
salary will be worth about 55,000 real cruzeiros, and on 1 April 
this salary will be 58,000 and some cruzeiros. The salary will 
not lose its purchasing power. The pensioner who gets his 
pension on the 12th of each month only has 80 percent of his 
pension by the end of the month, and receives only 60 percent of 
it on the 12th. Now this is no longer the case. Now for the 
pensioner who will get his pension on the 12th of the month, if 
the inflation rate was 40 percent, the full inflation percentage 
will be added to his pension. For the pensioner who has the 
minimum salary of 55,000 real cruzeiros, when he gets paid on 
the 12th he will get 70,000 real cruzeiros. Why? Because the 
salary is based on the URV. 
  As for prices, the entire country, as well as this 
minister, is sick of the speculation and abuses by the 
oligopolies and those who do not seem to understand that this is 
the time to support this decent, open, and clear program rather 
than continue to rob the people. 
  Why aren't we converting prices into URV's? Why don't we 
want to protect prices as we protect salaries? The salary 
earners are now protected by the URV. If prices go up, and I 
hope they will not -- and those who have abused the people's 
patience should beware -- salaries will go up automatically. 
Why? Because the URV is measured by three price indexes, and 
therefore any price increase automatically increases salaries. 
But we are not going to establish a price freeze, because this 
no solution; it only encourages those who operate on the black 
market, those who are going to bet on shortages. There will be 
no price freeze because it does not work for the people. Either 
prices drop or nobody will buy. And when a price is set by 
monopolies or oligopolies, they will have to face the government 
for a stern -- a very stern -- negotiation to make them 
understand that this transition process needs the unity of all 
Brazilians. These are not mere words. Brazil is tired. Brazil 
is tired of magic formulas, it is tired of experiments. 
  President Itamar Franco's government, which has always 
expressed its social awareness, knows that economic growth is 
important. 
  We are not designing a program to fight recession; we are 
designing a program to attain balance. We cannot attain a 
balance with unemployment. There are norms, within the 
provisional measure itself, that make unjustified dismissals 
more difficult. But rather than dismissals, we want people to 
think about employment, about increasing the number of job 
opportunities. This program, in the short term, will allow for 
safe investments. The stock exchange reflects this. We are not 
implementing measures that may harm the investors; quite the 
contrary, we want to attract national and foreign investors, we 
want to generate opportunities, we want to create more job 
opportunities. 
  Neither are we going to neglect specific programs such as 
the 
one to fight hunger, the program to generate job opportunities 
that I have just mentioned. We are depicting Brazil's real 
situation. Our new currency will be called the real. This 
process, this program, is a realistic program. We are not 
offering dreams. This is probably why we are enhancing some of 
the existing injustices, which will make the country even more 
anxious to solve them. We are already taking a step in this 
direction. We are going to seek paths that will improve the 
foundations of our society. What the finance minister is doing 
now is not a salary policy, because other ministers will be in 
charge of that. What the finance minister is doing now is to 
convert the currency by protecting salaries, the real income, as 
much as possible -- and it is possible because charts here show 
us it is so. 
  I am certain that when the time comes to take the next 
steps, 
when the time comes to convert the URV into the new currency, 
the real that will freely circulate throughout the country, we 
will do so in the same way, as we have done so far. We will 
take the next step making an announcement, anticipating the 
following steps, without straying away from our goals, 
negotiating. I do not think there has ever been such an open 
stabilization program as this one. 
  I talked with labor leaders whenever possible. I talked 
with representatives from practically all the labor federations. 
The most important labor leaders came here, to this ministry. 
Jair Meneguelli, Vicentinho [Vicente Paulo da Silva], [Luis 
Antonio de] Medeiros, [Francisco Caninde] Pegado, Urbano from 
the (Contagie), and [Antonio] Neto visited us. I never avoided 
a conversation, or the possibility of showing figures, or asking 
for suggestions. I always said that the government was open and 
will continue to be open. I maintained that I wanted solutions, 
not impasses, because Brazil cannot stop whenever claims cannot 
be answered immediately. 
  We did the same thing at Congress. We opened up the entire 
budget to discussion. We will do the same thing with society. 
This stage in the implementation of the real value unit will 
permit contracts to freely accommodate and adapt. We regulated 
only what was necessary. The few salary adjustment rules we 
implemented were to protect salary earners. We abstained from 
establishing price regulations because we wanted to protect 
salary earners, those who do the purchasing. 
  We will do the same thing now. This plan contains enough 
room for negotiations, negotiations over rents, school tuition, 
health plans. We hope society will adapt. 
  Contracts written in URV's, and all new contracts to be 
written in URV's as of 15 March, will be good for a year without 
adjustments. They will be stable bec9use they will be in URV's. 
The same rules will be applied when these contracts are 
renegotiated. This is a moment for great negotiations. Then we 
will look for the right time to implement the new currency. The 
media have been asking me questions every day. I need help from 
the media, the written, spoken, or televised media, to explain 
the program to the country. 
  Everybody wants to know when the government will implement 
the new currency. The answer is that we will implement it when 
the people think it is right. It will be implemented when the 
country has matured and has understood the rules, has understood 
that we will not implement any unfair practices here or there. 
Then the time will be ripe for the new currency. 
  If we change our currency now the gain will be small, 
because 
society will not have time to adapt. Something that looks 
unimportant now might change, become important, and make prices 
go up, breaking the plan's back. This is why we thought it was 
necessary to adjust things by their mean values. We wanted to 
protect the possibility of maintaining the program. We wanted 
the mean values used at one point to serve as the basis for 
future negotiations. 
  We are not freezing anybody's salary. The free negotiating 
system is on. I think we must all learn to negotiate more and 
more. From now on salary earners, civil servants, all those for 
whom we established a basic salary floor on 1 January, will be 
able to discuss real adjustments. It will no longer be a matter 
of recovering losses. Losses are automatically recovered by the 
URV. From now on the issue will be to correct injustices, 
negotiate their elimination, work more, increase productivity, 
earn more, make Brazil grow. Brazil can grow and it will grow. 
  When the real is implemented it will be the expression of a 
new country, a country such as the one I mentioned when I was 
installed, a country that has found a new dignity. The country 
must again believe in itself, because it cannot continue walking 
with a currency that melts away. It must have a new pataca [old 
Brazilian silver coin], a strong and firm currency with which to 
pay for the work of those who have been sweating all this time, 
those who will no longer be deceived by disappearing earnings. 
  From now on the job will be increasingly large. But I have 
faith. I have a lot of faith. I can feel this faith in the 
people. The people are looking forward, despite all the 
difficulties and hardships, to negotiating and discussing with 
firmness. I feel this faith in the government. This is a 
democratic government. I have never seen a more democratic 
government. This is President Itamar Franco's characteristic. 
He listens. He listens a lot, and permits the ironing out of 
differences. A government cannot work well if only one person 
speaks, even if he is the president, and least of all if he is 
just a minister. We all have the right and the obligation to 
give our opinions. Once something is decided we go ahead and 
implement the decision. That is real democracy, a lot of 
discussion, consensus, and spirit of solidarity to make things 
happen. This is our case. And we will march ahead; we will 
march ahead. 
  And I will conclude by saying that this year was a 
difficult year for the stabilization of the economy due to the 
historical pecularities of the elections. Perhaps for that same 
reason, in a country tired of so much corruption, tired of 
leaders who did not take risks, make decisions, and remain firm, 
the time has come for us to really stabilize the economy, and 
there should be no political process interfering in national 
decisions. Politicians, yes, but no partisan, individual, or 
candidate's interests interfering in decisions. 
  We really believe there is still a patriotic spirit, a 
desire 
by civilian and military men to serve the country. Here we are 
both civilians and military, discussing issues within a 
democratic framework. We make decisions together. Either we 
believe this or the situation would be serious, but we do 
believe this is the case. We are certain that this is the case: 
We are certain there will be no electoral promises capable of 
destroying the economic goal. 
  We thought Congress was sensitive to the clamor of the 
people, and it was; the people do not want influence peddling, 
the people do not want money spent uselessly on electoral 
promises, the people do not want a minister to say yes to 
something that should be rejected because it is no good for the 
country. The people want something else; the people want simple 
and decent individuals who work and believe. 
  The ministers who are here are making a great effort in that 
direction. This is how we are. We could make mistakes here and 
there, but as whole there is a great effort, stimulated by the 
president. As a whole we do not believe we are the only ones 
with the truth and the only ones fighting for our convictions. 
We are not used to fringe benefits; we are used to working like 
all Brazilian people. This program was made to be positive and 
affirmative for the people who work; not for those who make 
profits from usury, speculation, and monopolies; not for those 
who are not concerned for their fellow men, who feel no 
solidarity, and who do not believe this country has what it 
takes to put an end to hunger and misery. 
  The stabilization program will serve to increase growth, 
develop the country, and give a just and honest means of 
livelihood to all Brazilians. Thank you very much.

  [Text] The 37-article provisional measure [MP] published in 
the Official Gazette on 28 February creates the real (R$), which 
will have up to one year to be implemented, and the Real Value 
Unit (URV), which will function as an index currency, but 
without authorizing money issuance. At the moment of its 
enforcement on 1 March, the URV will be worth 647.50 real 
cruzeiros. The decision to implement the URV as an index 
currency seeks to avoid judicial pleas at the time of converting 
salaries and other prices to the new index. 
  The MP also creates a "Stabilization Council," which will be 
comprised of the Central Bank president and directors and three 
people with demonstrated knowledge about monetary policies. They 
will be in charge of suggesting a new monetary system and the 
way of backing its currency. 
  The government wants the currency to be backed by exchange 
reserves. In other words, the amount of real to be issued must 
have its equivalent in reserves, otherwise it will not be 
issued. This is how the economic team plans to make the real a 
strong currency: any attempt to increase prices will not be 
sanctioned by an equivalent increase in the amount of 
circulating currency. More demand for currency will make the 
cost of money -- the interests -- go up, thus discouraging 
consumption and forcing businessmen to reduce prices. 
  Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso plans to launch 
the real before May. Cardoso's advisers believe that the URV 
should be in force for, at least, three months. This period 
already is a compromise to Cardoso's political considerations. 
  According to the economic team, the Stabilization Council 
will also guide the government on how to end the use of the URV 
and to convert contracts in real cruzeiros to the new currency.

  [Text] Today Congress approved the request to promulgate 
the Social Emergency Fund. A total of 439 legislators were 
present, and the measure passed with 372 votes in favor, 61 
votes against, and six abstentions. 
  The bill establishing the fund could be promulgated even 
tonight if a proposal put forth by Deputy Germano Rigotto is 
accepted. He proposed to vote on a request to give priority to 
a vote on the political chapter that includes the deadline for 
incompatibility, and then close the session. A new session 
could then be convened immediately afterwards to promulgate the 
Social Emergency Fund. In this case the decision would be 
published in the congressional newspaper tomorrow. 
  Some political parties are concerned with the reduction of 
the period on incompatibility for running in the upcoming 
election. Rigotto's request was approved, although following a 
request to verify the quorum.

<F P=106> [Interview with Admiral Mario Cesar Flores, secretary of </F>
strategic affairs, by Carlos Chagas of MANCHETE; place and date 
not given; first three paragraphs are MANCHETE introduction] 
  [Text] Common sense and democratic sentiments. The 
combination of those two attributes makes Admiral Mario Cesar 
Flores, secretary of strategic affairs, an example of the right 
person in the right place. The image the country became 
accustomed to between 1964 and 1985--that of the truculent and 
radical, albeit well-intentioned, military officer--has been 
left behind. Now there is a new generation of general officers 
who, since the New Republic, have been exemplary in performing 
their duties, the primary one being to guarantee and preserve 
democracy and see that it is upheld. 
  In an exclusive interview with MANCHETE, Admiral Flores, 
without mincing words, discussed the question of threats against 
the regime and rejected the fujimorization theory, as did the 
minister of justice two weeks ago, using a very simple argument: 
there are no Fujimoris in Brazil; President Itamar Franco's 
democratic convictions are above all suspicion; and furthermore, 
the Armed Forces will not support or tolerate a breach of 
institutional normality. 
  The strategic affairs secretary also talked about such 
subjects as the defense of our borders, the internationalization 
of Amazonia, Indian tribes, and the role of Brazil on the world 
stage. Flores notes that history has always featured crises and 
confusion when a nation that holds military leadership is losing 
economic leadership, so it is preferable to try to achieve an 
equilibrium between the two powers. 
  [Chagas] Former President Fernando Collor abolished the SNI 
[National Intelligence Service] and was unanimously applauded 
here for his action, but that left the government without an 
intelligence body to support the Office of President of Brazil. 
Does the Strategic Affairs Secretariat play that role? 
  [Admiral Flores] The duties of the SAE are broader than that 
of a mere successor to the SNI, which was created as a healthy 
and well-conceived organization. It was only with the passage of 
time that the SNI acquired vices and distortions and performed 
functions inconsistent with the mere gathering, analysis, and 
dissemination of intelligence. With the Collor government's 
administrative reform came the abolition of the SNI and the 
creation of the SAE, which has an intelligence department. This 
is insufficient. In my opinion, the SNI needed corrective 
surgery, but its abolition did not solve the problem. There is 
still a need for intelligence. There is a preliminary proposal 
being studied in the administration that would rebuild an 
autonomous intelligence body suited to the democratic regime we 
live under. Sooner or later the intelligence area will be 
separated from the SAE, but the important thing is to 
rationalize that activity and its procedures on the basis of 
democracy. 
  [Chagas] A lot has been said about the possibility of coups 
and the adoption of anti-democratic measures, including 
fujimorization. Does that danger exist? 
  [Admiral Flores] The SAE has not detected anything 
concerning 
fujimorization. The press has published reports on the subject. 
There is not the least chance of this, for two reasons. The 
first is that President Itamar Franco has deep-rooted democratic 
convictions. The other is that these things do not happen 
without the support, or at least the tolerance, of the military. 
And the armed forces are committed to the democratic experiment. 
  [Chagas] What about the various groups of military 
reservists 
who preach nondemocratic solutions in manifestoes and 
proclamations? 
  [Admiral Flores] Those groups are made up of patriotic and 
well-intentioned people who envision solutions to this nation's 
problems that are impossible to implement. I believe they should 
keep doing what they are doing; it serves as incentive for us to 
concern ourselves with national problems. But I do not see how 
the consequence of the activities of those organizations can be 
a breakdown of institutions in this country. 
  [Chagas] And what about the anger of the multitudes? And do 
the active military share those diagnoses? 
  [Admiral Flores] I confess that I still do not quite 
understand what General Leonel meant to say. I imagine he was 
referring to the fact that in the past 15 years the Armed Forces 
have been relegated to a very dangerously low degree of 
priority, because their training has been declining in quality 
and the renovation of military equipment leaves a lot to be 
desired. We are not keeping pace with the technological 
developments seen in the rest of the world. Then there is the 
parallel problem of pay scales. What is happening to military 
pay lately is brutal. The same is true of public servants in 
general, with few exceptions. 
  [Chagas] They say an elevator operator in the Congress 
building earns more than the pilot of a Mirage. 
  [Admiral Flores] I have heard it is more worthwhile to pilot 
an elevator in the Congress than to fly a Mirage. I never 
compared the two, but the disproportions are enormous. That 
leads to dissatisfaction, but there is no reason at all for 
dissatisfaction to translate into institutional concern. We are 
a country that is battling difficulties, whose people are poor. 
We have to understand that the military cannot be a privileged 
class. But that sacrifice must be shared equally with all public 
servants. 
  [Chagas] Would you admit that there is a possibility that 
the 
military, especially the younger men, might be receptive to the 
preachings of the PT [Workers Party]? 
  [Admiral Flores] The military are citizens. There are 
probably many who, as citizens, follow the arguments of the PT 
with affection and attention. Just as there are others who do 
not. It is not in any way desirable that the military should 
link up with political parties. I still remember that 40 years 
ago, the military's excessive tendency to follow the UDN 
[National Democratic Union] did not yield results that can be 
termed excellent. 
  [Chagas] Many people imagine that the Amazon region is in 
danger, at the mercy of a foreign invader, or threatened with 
internationalization. Do you agree that there are grounds for 
those fears? 
  [Admiral Flores] I do not believe those threats exist. 
Obviously, we are seeing a worldwide sensitivity on the subject 
of the Amazon region. There are correct views, and many 
inaccurate ones. Myths have been created about the region. The 
world is worried about the Amazon, but that does not mean there 
are risks or--for example--threats of military action. What 
there is, is a tendency to condition international bodies--the 
World Bank for example--to support Brazilian projects provided 
they are subordinated to certain attitudes about Amazonia. 
  [Chagas] Isn't that subordination an affront to our 
sovereignty? 
  [Admiral Flores] The world is moving toward curbing the 
concept of sovereignty. If we want international support for 
Brazilian plans, we have to understand certain restrictive 
factors. It is a two-way street. Those interferences must be 
negotiated and, to the extent possible, reduced so that the 
balance is favorable for Brazil. 
  [Chagas] We have seen documents from other countries that 
suggest that autonomous territories, separate from Brazil, be 
created for Indian nations. What about this? 
  [Admiral Flores] Well, we could not agree to that in any 
form. The Indian areas must not be converted to tribal 
territories. That would be unacceptable. We have to accept the 
idea of demarcation of Indian lands to protect the tribal 
cultures, but the question is a complex one. In recent years it 
has become surrounded with a lot of emotion, spurred on by 
various interests, including foreign ones, concerned about 
conservation of natural resources as a reserve for the future. 
We have to take another look at the issue of Indian land 
demarcation because there are Indians, and then there are 
Indians. There are Indians who are still in the neolithic phase 
and perhaps want to stay that way. They deserve to have their 
lands marked off and to get special protection from the state. 
But then there are other Indians who exploit their reservation 
in a capitalistic fashion. Some chiefs have their own airplanes. 
So the rules should not be merely anthropological. We have to 
take into account the degree of acculturation and integration 
into society. An Indian who makes his living from a small farm 
whose products are sold in a nearby town is, in fact, a rural 
citizen and should be treated that way. Still, the demarcation 
of his territory needs to be generous, because his farming 
techniques are probably rudimentary. But the same 
anthropological rule cannot be adopted for that Indian as for 
the neolithic tribes, which need much larger expanses of land. 
  [Chagas] Should separatism be considered as nonsense, or 
might it represent a threat? 
  [Admiral Flores] I see no danger at all. These are 
manifestations of ideologized minorities that do not reflect the 
views of the people of those very regions, who are Brazilian and 
want to remain Brazilian. I don't waste time on that. 
  [Chagas] Are there strategic concerns with our neighbors 
across the border? 
  [Admiral Flores] In terms of relations with our neighbors, 
the situation is pretty calm. In South America, the risks we 
might face on our borders would result from illegal activities, 
not from conflicts between states. By illegal activities I am 
referring to the narcotics traffic, the production of drugs, and 
the guerrillas in the neighboring countries who could extend 
their activities into Brazilian territory as an alleged 
sanctuary. Those things can happen, although not supported, and 
even opposed, by the governments of the neighboring countries. 
So, in state-to-state terms, I do not see any threat of 
conflicts in South America. 
  [Chagas] And what about the world situation? 
  [Admiral Flores] I think it is rather unstable. We are 
seeing 
conflicts all over the world--although, oddly enough, very few 
in the Americas despite all the socioeconomic difficulties we 
are experiencing. Brazil's role in world conflicts will always 
be one of cooperation with international organizations. Our size 
cannot be ignored, we have influence, and that influence brings 
with it a responsibility for participating in the world order. I 
would be sympathetic to having the Brazilian armed forces better 
prepared to render assistance in the world under the mandate of 
an international organization. 
  [Chagas] The fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of 
the Soviet Union ended bipolarity in the world. There is only 
one superpower, a new Rome, and it dictates its interests, even 
militarily. Has that made our situation worse? 
  [Admiral Flores] Although I have little nostalgia for the 
vanished bipolarity, I recognize that unipolarity is not good 
for the other nations. At any rate, I do not really subscribe to 
the theory that the world today is unipolar. Perhaps it is so 
strategically, from the military standpoint--but even then, I 
say this with reservations. Russia is very well armed. Western 
Europe is a military power. Certainly there is no doubt that the 
great military power, the world's strategic referee, is the 
United States. But from the economic standpoint it is not alone; 
in fact, it has been losing ground. A situation in which the 
biggest military power is not the biggest economic power has 
never worked out well. History shows us that confusion always 
occurs whenever there is a disassociation between those two 
factors. The military power reacts militarily against the loss 
of status in the economic sector. I would look favorably on an 
improved military capability in Western Europe, not to counter 
the United States, but to balance things. 
  [Chagas] Where does Japan fit in our equation? 
  [Admiral Flores] Japan enjoys a pleasant situation, one that 
it can invest all its resources in economic development, 
protected by the American umbrella to the extent that its 
adversary was the Soviet Union. Japan is, without any doubt, the 
shining focal point of a Pacific economic sphere. To a certain 
extent, what is happening is extremely curious, and ironic as 
well, because Japan tried to accomplish this by force in 1942. 
The Asiatic prosperity sphere is now being run peacefully, and 
under the leadership of the Japanese. Sooner or later, that is 
going to interfere with the better preparedness of the Japanese 
and their associates for military action. The unknown factor in 
the region is China. What is China's role? If it should come to 
terms with Japan, we are going to see an extraordinary power. 
Who knows whether the 21st century might be the century of the 
Pacific, as many people say it will? 
  [Chagas] President Itamar Franco puts a lot of faith in an 
integration between Brazil and China. Doesn't distance work 
against that? 
  [Admiral Flores] It is an obstacle, but the alliance is 
workable, given the potentials of the two countries. It looks as 
though our closer relationships in technological terms will be 
successful very quickly, especially in the field of satellites. 
  [Chagas] Lula would be elected president if the elections 
were held today. Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes 
predicts there will be a coup six months after the PT candidate 
takes office. Would you agree? 
  [Admiral Flores] I see no reason to. In politics, it is one 
thing to be a candidate, but something else to govern. Whether 
Luis Inacio da Silva or someone else is the victor, when he 
takes over he will find that the restrictions imposed by the 
responsibility will force the process to evolve in a controlled 
and moderated manner. We will not be taking a leap in the dark. 
At least at the moment, I do not envision any institutional 
earthquake. 
  [Chagas] The president of Brazil is having trouble imposing 
the rule that no one in government service can earn more than 
the equivalent of 90 percent of the salary received by a 
minister of state. Isn't that absurd? 
  [Admiral Flores] Corporativism is a national affliction. The 
Judiciary refused to uphold the application of that rule to the 
state enterprises because they are governed by labor law. But 
they should also be governed by tax law. And despite the 
position taken by the courts, there is still the ethical 
question. It is absurd for an employee of a company that is 
owned by the common people to earn more than the president of 
Brazil. Things cannot go on this way. In a poor country like 
ours, there is no justification for a public servant to be paid 
100 times the minimum monthly wage.

<F P=106> [Article by Abnor Gondim: "Army Can Build Roads, Says Lula"] </F>
  [Text] Santarem--Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the PT's 
[Workers Party's] potential candidate for president, said during 
a meeting with civic groups at the Federal University of Para in 
Santarem, Para, yesterday that the Army could replace 
construction firms on such public works projects as road 
construction. 
  According to him, it is necessary to give the military more 
work to do so they will stop concerning themselves with other 
things. Lula said he also believed that the military could 
fulfill an important mission in the field of public health in 
areas such as the Amazon Region. 
  Lula also said that if he is elected, the result after five 
years of his administration will be that "no child of school age 
will be out of school, no one will go to bed without having had 
three meals that day, and we will carry out agrarian reform, no 
matter who gets hurt and no matter who cries about it." 
  Lula refused to support establishment of the State of 
Tapajos 
at a meeting with Santarem businessmen at that city's yacht 
club. He said it was necessary to be cautious when considering 
the establishment of new states in our country in order not to 
repeat the mistakes that were made in connection with the States 
of Roraima and Amapa. 
  The PT's potential candidate said that physicians belonging 
to the Citizenship Caravan along the Amazon River, such as 
Antonio Fontelles (PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party], Para), could 
not do anything to save a terminally ill child in the 
municipality of Juruti on the border between Para and Amazonas. 
According to Lula, there was no hospital in the municipality, 
and the doctors could not do anything. 
  The meeting by the PT National Executive Committee that was 
scheduled for today has been postponed until next week. Until 
then, there will be no ruling on the appeal by the party's bloc 
in Congress against a decision by the party's officers banning 
participation by the deputies in constitutional revision.

<F P=106> [Interview with Senator and former President Jose Sarney by </F>
Denise Rothenburg; place and date not given: "Plan for 
Governability"; introductory paragraph in boldface as published] 
  [Text] Brasilia--While several parties are getting 
together in an attempt to find a candidate who can defeat Luis 
Inacio Lula da Silva in the presidential race, Senator Jose 
Sarney (PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], Amapa) is 
working on a plan to ensure the country of governability. He 
claims he has no "Lulaphobia" and says he does not approve of 
constitutional revision in the way it is now being carried 
out. 
  [Rothenburg] Do you believe that parties such as the PMDB, 
the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], and others can form 
an alliance capable of defeating the PT [Workers Party] at the 
ballot box, considering that all the polls now show Lula as the 
favorite? 
  [Sarney] An alliance cannot be against anyone. We must have 
an alliance, true, but not to defeat the PT. An alliance must be 
based on a plan for the country, and we are going to work to 
that end. I have no Lulaphobia. The PT is now a large 
organization and part of the country's institutional structure. 
The PT needs to combat its radicals whether it wins or loses, 
and Lula is mindful of that. I am not one of those who start 
talking disaster when they think of the PT. 
  [Rothenburg] Does this mean that you might even support Lula 
in the second round of balloting? 
  [Sarney] In politics, we cannot talk about what might happen 
in the future. At the moment, our problem is to establish an 
alliance that will have a plan for the country. And that 
alliance cannot exclude the PFL [Liberal Front Party]. 
  [Rothenburg] Do you believe it will be easy to bring the 
PSDB, PFL, and PMDB with all their different factions together 
following Governor Ciro Gomes's criticism of certain people in 
the PMDB? 
  [Sarney] The evaluation of alliances will have to be made by 
those entrusted with making it. I will not comment on the 
statements by Governor Ciro Gomes. What I do know is that we 
have already had one experience with the PFL--the Democratic 
Alliance--and it resulted in the election of 22 governors and an 
absolute majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. 
  [Rothenburg] But who would be the ideal candidate for that 
alliance? 
  [Sarney] I don't know, but it will have to be someone from 
the PMDB, since that is the largest party. It is necessary in an 
alliance to take the weight of each party into account. The PMDB 
is a center-left party. It was responsible for the democratic 
transition, and it has some outstanding people. Anyone from that 
party who is a candidate will have my support. 
  [Rothenburg] Would you exclude your own name from those 
negotiations? 
  [Sarney] I have received several letters from admirers 
asking 
me not to exclude my own name. I have told all of them that I do 
not want to throw my hat in the ring. I have already been 
president, and I have no more ambitions. 
  [Rothenburg] You had dinner on Tuesday with Minister 
Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso. Was there any promise of support for the plan? 
  [Sarney] Basically, what we talked about was constitutional 
revision. What I see is an absence of guidelines in our work. 
There is no coordination regarding the points that need revision. 
  [Rothenburg] Are you against revision? 
  [Sarney] No. The problem is that we are concerning ourselves 
with peripheral matters and engaging in casuistry.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Eduardo Alves: "PSDB Opinion: Ciro Gomes </F>
Is Organizing His Candidacy"] 
  [Text] Fortaleza--The talks regarding an alliance between 
the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] and the PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party] led to an exchange of 
accusations yesterday between Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio 
Fleury Filho (PMDB) and Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes (PSDB). The 
day before yesterday, Ciro criticized an alliance with the PMDB. 
Fleury said yesterday that "instead of speaking cholerically, 
the governor ought to taking care of the cholera in his 
state"--a reference to the fact that Ceara leads the nation in 
cholera cases. 
  "All indications are that he (Ciro) wants to become a 
candidate thanks to Fernando Henrique's failure," Fleury said. 
Fleury also said that it was the president of the PSDB, Tasso 
Jereissati, who had asked him to initiate talks. He said 
sarcastically: "Since they are both from the same state, they 
should have discussed the matter." 
  Ciro Gomes reacted with sarcasm to the statement that he was 
unable to control cholera in Ceara and that that was why he was 
making choleric statements. "I think that shot was fired from 
Carandiru," he said, referring to the massacre of 111 prisoners 
at Carandiru in 1992. 
  "The shot was fired from Carandiru because, first of all, 
cholera is an epidemic all over Latin America, and governments 
have little control over it in the present circumstances. 
Second, because treating its effects requires good health care. 
And since health care is a municipal responsibility, it is the 
responsibility of the local government, which here in Fortaleza 
has been under the control of Fleury's PMDB for many years," 
Gomes said. 
  The governor also said that he "would rather leave politics" 
than appear on the same platform as the former governor of Sao 
Paulo, Orestes Quercia, in the presidential race. "The PSDB came 
into existence as a rejection of Quercia politics, which 
constitutes the worst element of Brazilian politics, and for 
that reason an electoral alliance will not have my support," 
Ciro said. 
  The PSDB leadership believes that Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes 
has decided to enter the race for president of the republic. 
Ciro's statements bombarding the already difficult alliance with 
the PMDB, his attacks on Lula, and his constant attempts to 
obtain space in the media are leading PSDB leaders--mainly those 
in Sao Paulo--to bet that Ciro's short-term goal is Planalto 
Palace. 
  Ciro's sudden appearance in the presidential scenario has 
intensified the quarrel between the Ceara and Sao Paulo groups 
of the PSDB. Although it is not admitted publicly, there are 
disagreements between the two wings. The view of the group 
closest to Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso is that although 
it may not have been intentional, Ciro has done a great 
disservice to Fernando Henrique's plan and indirectly to the 
minister's candidacy by provoking a verbal duel with the PMDB. 
  If Fernando Henrique is unable to make his candidacy work, 
the Ceara governor will have room to become a presidential 
candidate himself, say PSDB members close to the minister. But 
even while criticizing Ciro's attack on the PMDB, top PSDB 
leaders admit that an electoral alliance between the two parties 
was already practically impossible anyway. 
  In the PSDB, there is talk of the "Garrincha effect" in the 
group put together by Senator Pedro Simon (PMDB, Rio Grande do 
Sul) to unite the two parties for the October elections. The 
reference is to the soccer player who, following a complicated 
explanation by his coach on how to reach the opposing goal, 
asked: "Did you make a deal with the opponent?" In this case, 
the opponents are former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia and 
the quarrels between the PMDB and PSDB at the state level. 
  Relations between the two parties are very complicated in 
such states as Sao Paulo, Ceara, Bahia, Minas Gerais, Parana, 
and others. Members of the PSDB, especially Senator Mario Covas 
(Sao Paulo), have been saying over and over that in combined 
elections like those to be held in October, it will be very 
difficult to explain to the voters why state alliances are 
different from the national alliance. 
  In talks with PSDB leaders, Simon has been insisting that a 
strong movement for union between the two parties might corral 
Quercia and make him refrain from running for president. But 
neither Simon nor Deputy Luiz Henrique, the PMDB's national 
president, who also wants a coalition, can give a conclusive 
answer when the PSDB asks them for guarantees that the agreement 
will not be shot down by Quercia. 
  The PSDB comes away from its talks with the PMDB with the 
impression that former Minister Antonio Britto is beginning to 
enjoy the talk about a possible presidential candidacy. But 
Britto also fears Quercia's influence in a possible boycott of 
his candidacy. 
<H5>  Ciro Meets With Maluf, Gives Speech </H5>
  Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes (PSDB) will begin his schedule 
today by having breakfast with Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf (PPR 
[Progressive Renewal Party]), after which he will address 27 
foreign press correspondents stationed in Brazil. 
  The subject of Ciro's speech will be "Post-Collor Brazil and 
Economic Prospects for 1994." The journalists are in Fortaleza 
to attend the seminar on "Foreign Correspondents and National 
Reality" that is being sponsored jointly by the Ceara 
Secretariat of Culture and the National Federation of 
Journalists. 
  According to Ciro, the meeting with Maluf "is a gesture" of 
courtesy, and the meeting with journalists has no connection 
with the presidential race. "Actually, I am an anticandidate. If 
I wanted to be a candidate, I would be traveling around the 
Amazon Region or involved in administrative matters rather than 
making statements that only make enemies for me," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergio Danilo: "Brazil and Cuba May Sign </F>
Technical Cooperation Accord"] 
  [Text] Rio de Janeiro--Acting through the Union of Mining 
Geologists, the Government of Cuba has accepted the proposal by 
the Mineral Resources Prospecting Company (CPRM) to sign a 
Brazil-Cuba accord in the areas of geology and mining sometime 
this year. That information was provided to this newspaper by 
Samir Nahass, head of the CPRM's Division of International 
Relations. 
  The Cubans have been interested since last year in signing 
the agreement to allow the two countries to exchange experts in 
the areas of prospecting and production. Cuba has large mining 
reserves of nickel, a mineral considered strategic by the world 
metallurgical industry. The Cubans were previously being given 
technical assistance by Soviet advisers from the former USSR. 
Now it is Brazil, with its big potential for nickel mines and 
its available technology, which will be able to provide Cuba 
with a package of services. 
<H5>  China </H5>
  Brazil's main reserve of niobium ores--the deposit in Seis 
Lagos, Amazonas, which is owned by the CPRM and has reserves of 
rare earths--lacks the technology for separating those ores from 
the other elements that are present. 
  According to Nahass, the Ministry of Geology and Mining of 
the PRC has offered that technology to the CPRM. Last year four 
geologists from the CPRM were in Beijing studying the quality of 
Chinese geology and familiarizing themselves with the mining 
technologies that may be transferred here for use in the CPRM's 
projects. 
  The Chinese, who became the world's second-largest producer 
of iron ore last year (178 million metric tons), want to acquire 
the technology for concentrating iron ore from the Brazilians.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Celso Amorim yesterday defended the 
need to overcome "rigid patterns of political power in the 
international community," and proposed the installation of 
structures reflecting the new reality that appeared with the end 
of the cold war, the BRASIL news agency has reported. 
  In a speech delivered in Bonn during the luncheon offered in 
his honor by German Foreign Affairs Minister Klaus Kinkel, 
Amorim emphasized the need of organizations, such as the United 
Nations, to have an all-encompassing and meaningful 
representativity reflecting the new international order. 
  According to him, mechanisms must be adopted that are "tuned 
to the new international political configuration" so that the 
multilateral forums reflect "with more faithfulness and equity 
the various interests and concepts that are appearing in today's 
world." Brazil supports the idea of expanding the UN Security 
Council, and is striving for inclusion among those countries 
seeking a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. The 
Brazilian Government supports German candidacy to the Security 
Council. 
  During the first day of his 48-hour visit to Bonn and 
Berlin, 
Amorim emphasized Brazilian interest in expanding its scientific 
and technological cooperation with Germany, including that in 
high technology projects. As he recalled, recent measures 
adopted in the country, including ratification of the agreement 
among Brazil, Argentina, and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (which contemplates supervision of the nuclear facilities 
and the peaceful use of atomic energy), and Brazil's decision to 
comply with the guidelines of the Missile Technology Control 
Regime (MTCR) will facilitate this cooperation. 
  The Brazilian foreign minister also pointed out that at 
several multilateral forums Brazil has been contributing to 
preserving balance in the post-cold war world, such as in issues 
related to trade, the environment, disarmament, and human rights.

<F P=106> [Article by Rio de Janeiro correspondent Sergio Adeodato] </F>
  [Text] The husband-and-wife team of Russian scientists 
Boris Margulis and Irina Fridlarkoca arrived in Rio de Janeiro 
last month with their family, and carrying in their luggage the 
technological know-how [preceding word in English] that enables 
them to swap their measly salaries of $50 a month in Moscow for 
the $3,000 [monthly] they will start earning as heads of the 
hybridoma laboratory at the recently established Universidade 
Estadual do Norte Fluminense--UENF [State University of Northern 
Rio de Janeiro], located in the municipality of Campos. 
  The university has already invested $60 million in plant and 
equipment. This month it begins the second semester since its 
founding, and it is hiring 22 Russian researchers to staff five 
high-tech laboratories in the fields of biotechnology, new 
materials, and molecular biology--facilities at which projects 
will be carried out that are directly related to the 
socioeconomic realities of the northern Fluminense region, where 
agriculture and oil prospecting predominate. 
  "In 1992, right after we announced the intention to bring in 
Russian scientists, we received more than 300 resumes from 
Russia. We had to send four academic delegations to that country 
last year to make the selections," said Wanderley de Souza, the 
molecular biologist who is rector of UENF. He recalled that, 
with budget appropriations continuing to shrink, "working 
conditions for Russian scientists in most technological fields 
are very bad, maybe worse than in Brazil." 
  Boris and Irina, like other married foreign scientists who 
decided to move to Campos, will be given airline tickets for the 
entire family, in addition to a subsidy equivalent to two 
salaries so that they can settle in the city. This benefit is 
also extended to the unmarried. The contracts are for a minimum 
of two years. "Institutions in the United States have offered 
the Russians salaries averaging $5,000, but many opted for Rio 
de Janeiro, not just out of concern that they might experience 
discrimination by the Americans, but because of good medium and 
long-term market prospects for their technologies in Brazil," de 
Souza said. 
  Along with scientist Alexander Kineo, also contracted by the 
university, the couple will bring to Brazil advanced techniques 
for production of reagents to be used in faster and more 
efficient diagnosis of illnesses like toxoplasmosis, a disease 
transmitted by a protozoan that attacks the central nervous 
system and the eyes. The new diagnostic method (at present, this 
country imports the tests) will be developed by fusing cells 
that produce antibodies (the body's defense agents) with cells 
from tumors that have the ability to reproduce themselves on a 
large scale. This will produce a hybridoma, i.e., a cell that 
combines the capacity to defend an organism with the ability to 
multiply itself in large numbers, thereby making commercial 
production feasible. 
<H5>  Transgenics </H5>
  A group of eight Russian scientists, all with doctor's 
degrees and headed by Oleg Serov and Alexander Kerkis of the 
Institute of Cytology and Genetics of the Academy of Sciences of 
Russia, will work on development of transgenic animals, such as 
goats that have been genetically altered to produce milk 
containing insulin. Other animals with transplanted genes might 
be used to obtain blood clotting factors that are vital to 
hemophiliacs. 
  The chief product of the new materials laboratory will be 
the 
technology for producing artificial diamonds by compression of 
carbon molecules. These diamonds are essential to equipment such 
as dentists' drills, marble-cutting tools, and oil-drilling 
bits--the latter being one of the region's main economic 
activities. 
  The technology of the synthetic materials known as 
"superhards," developed by a group of five Russian scientists 
that will work at UENF for two years, reflects the technological 
strategy being pursued by this institution: absorb the know-how 
at an advanced point in its development without spending many 
years on research, so that the technology can be transferred to 
industry in the midterm future. "The technologies will be 
intimately related to the vocations of this region," said Gilca 
Alves Wianstein, president of the State Foundation of Northern 
Rio de Janeiro, the institution responsible for administration 
of UENF, which has the flexibility and independence needed to 
set up commercial and technological partnerships with the 
production sector. 
  In the vicinity of its 25,000 square meter campus--which 
during the first semester of this academic year will house 278 
undergraduate and graduate students and 50 researchers--the UENF 
plans to encourage the formation of a high-tech complex 
sustained mainly by biofactories that produce cuttings for use 
in growing fruit and sugarcane, and in reforestation.

  [Text] New rumors of a coup d'etat caused great turmoil at 
Congress this morning. The new coup was allegedly being 
prepared against President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. 
  It is worth noting that the rumor again had as its main 
actors Deputies Francisco Jose de Vargas and Hermes Rafael 
Saguier, two legislators characterized by their regular reports 
of preparations being made for coups d'etat. 
  The rumor, which did not make clear its origin, the reasons 
supporting it, or who was behind it, rocked congressional 
circles. Following a series of meetings behind closed doors it 
then finally dissipated. 
  Military, government, and ruling party officials 
categorically denied the alleged existence of a coup. 
  The calm congressional morning was broken when a meeting of 
the Chamber of Deputies special commission created to analyze 
the social priorities for the year was abruptly curtailed to 
allow De Vargas, Euclides Acevedo, and Nery Filemon Gonzalez to 
walk to Government Palace. 
  The delegation returned to the Congress building a few 
minutes later, and continued their closed door meeting. Then 
suddenly the meeting was ended and legislators withdrew from the 
premises. The first report, which was later denied, indicated 
that the legislators drove to the 1st Army Corps headquarters in 
Campo Grande, or to the U.S. Embassy. 
  De Vargas denied the rumor, as well as his having visited 
any 
of the above mentioned institutions. He also denied the 
existence of a coup plot.

  [Text] Deputy Hermes Rafael Saguier [also known as "Rambo"] 
told journalists on 28 February that coup d'etat rumors have 
been circulating since last weekend. He explained that at a 
social gathering high-ranking military officers had uttered 
"offensive remarks" about the president of the nation. Saguier 
added that according to the information he has, the whole thing 
is nothing but a rumor. He made it clear, however, that should 
the rumors come true the members of the Legislative Branch will 
be prepared to defend the nation's institutional order even if 
they do not agree with President Wasmosy. 
  Deputy Saguier told the journalists that the rumors about a 
coup d'etat began after a high-ranking military officer in the 
course of a social gathering threatened to arrest President Juan 
Carlos Wasmosy. 
  "At a ceremony to launch a new brand of beer, a drunken 
division general apparently said that he could arrest Wasmosy 
any time he wanted. The general even threatened to prevent the 
president from addressing Congress. A colonel who also attended 
the party uttered similar remarks. He stated specifically that 
they would take the president by the ear and put him in a cell," 
Saguier explained. 
  The deputy said that according to his sources, several 
businessmen were present on the occasion and they heard what the 
military officers said. "The officers did not restrict 
themselves to the above remarks but went on commenting 
offensively about the president of the nation," Saguier stated. 
  "Rambo" Sanguier explained that the conflict between the 
abovementioned division general and President Wasmosy apparently 
cropped up because the two support different candidates to chair 
the Colorado Party Executive Board. 
  In the morning on 28 February Saguier and Chamber of 
Deputies 
Speaker Francisco Jose de Vargas went on a fact-finding 
expedition to see whether the rumors could be confirmed. 
  Saguier said that they talked with several military officers 
and diplomats to find out whether a coup d'etat was actually in 
the making. 
  Saguier added: "We talked to several key embassies and they 
told us that they had heard the rumors but had no information 
that gave them a clear idea of the situation. The embassies 
also told us that they had checked the main military units which 
did not appear to be getting ready for action." 
  Later on the deputy stated that all congressmen are prepared 
to defend the nation's institutional order. 
  "I deeply disagree with the president on several matters but 
I will defend the country's institutional order all the same. 
You may rest assured of this because yet another rumor 
indicated that Congress would surrender to the coupists. We are 
totally committed to the Constitution and we will defend it in 
spite of General Lino Oviedo or even Wasmosy himself," Saguier 
said.

  [Excerpt] Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez 
Boettner told ABC COLOR on 26 February that the decision of 
Brazilian customs officials to eliminate the 300 percent bond 
that Paraguayan imports had to pay upon arrival at the Brazilian 
port of Santos for further transfer to Ciudad del Este, was 
greatly influenced by the positive attitude of the Brazilian 
Foreign Ministry, which reacted favorably to a request from its 
Paraguayan counterpart and recommended that the issue be studied. 
  Following two days of negotiations with Paraguayan Customs 
Director General Miguel Angel Britos, who had been sent to 
Brasilia to find a solution to the problem, top officials of the 
Brazilian Federal Revenue (the office in charge of collecting 
custom taxes) announced on 25 February that the 300-percent bond 
on all Paraguayan imports through the port of Santos has been 
eliminated. [passage omitted]

  [Text] After three hours of deliberations at government 
palace the Executive Branch decided to repeal Decree 436 signed 
in September last year by President Juan Carlos Wasmosy granting 
-- according to party representatives to the governability pact 
-- the cotton harvesting monopoly to Cadelpa [Paraguayan Cotton 
Chamber]. President Wasmosy convened a meeting of Industry and 
Commerce Minister Ubaldo Scavone, Agriculture and Livestock 
Minister Raul Torres, Cadelpa President Roberto Antebi, and 
Oscar Aranda, of Inagrisa [Agricultural and Industrial 
Investments, Inc.] to discuss the situation. Following the 
announcement made by Scavone and Torres, Antebi rose to express 
his disagreement over the proceeding. "We accept the decision, 
but we do not share it," Antebi said, adding that the government 
did not respect the signed agreement. Antebi questioned the fact 
that the government made the decision "during the last minute of 
the game." 
  Antebi said that last year the private sector was called in 
to bear the burden of solving the critical problem created by 
the picudo [cotton infecting insect] invasion. Besides, 
producers did not have any incentives to cultivate cotton. 
Cadelpa actively participated in promoting cotton production 
with seeds, raw materials, financial and technological support, 
and provided the necessary resources, Antebi said. 
  The industrialist added that conditions then were very bad 
and that Cadelpa knowingly assumed the risk of fighting the 
picudo infection which at the time was calculated to have 
affected 50 percent of the land used for cotton cultivation. "It 
was necessary to take preventive measures and Cadelpa imported 
the best insecticides to fight the scourge and supplied them to 
producers at cost," Antebi said. Besides, Cadelpa contracted 18 
foreign experts in the disease, 100 engineers, organized more 
than 1,000 meetings, trained 10,000 operators and as a result 
today peasants know how to treat the disease, Antebi explained. 
  Antebi said that Cadelpa thinks the cotton industry is being 
used as a "scapegoat" because currently there are many other 
serious political problems. The industrialist said the decision 
will end up causing more damage to agricultural production in 
the future. 
  "The money always goes where it is safe to invest. Nearly 
$120 million have been invested in agriculture and that is why 
the rules of the game should have been respected," Antebi said. 
"If there is no security for investments then who will invest in 
agriculture next year? We will see if the government, 
politicians, religious people, or who will be interested in 
investing in agriculture. The private sector will watch and if 
conditions are appropriate will participate, otherwise it will 
not," Antebi emphasized.

  [Excerpt] On 26 February Eugenio Sanabria Cantero, 
president of the ruling National Republican Association, ANR 
[Colorado Party], justified the administration's decision to 
repress peasants who blocked highways "because principles and 
laws in effect cannot be violated." The ruling party leader 
emphasized that the Colorado Party cannot "take credit" for the 
administration's positive actions alone, but rather "accept the 
good along with the bad." 
  Following the official ceremony marking the anniversary of 
ANR founder General Bernardino Caballero's death at the Heroes' 
Memorial in Asuncion, Sanabria Cantero was asked about the 
repression of peasants. He answered: "As the ruling party we 
cannot take credit for just the positive aspects of the 
administration's performance, but rather accept the good along 
with the bad." 
  The Colorado Party president stated that he justifies 
everything the administration may do to prevent violations of 
the principles and laws in effect. Sanabria Cantero asked the 
journalists: "Do you believe it is proper for the peasants to 
block the highways?" 
  He added that repression cannot be treated separately from 
the peasant problem, the attitude of the peasants should be 
taken into account. The Colorado Party leader emphasized that 
citizens who voice just demands will always have the party's 
support, provided they do so within the framework of the law. 
  It appears, however, that Sanabria Cantero contradicted 
himself on the subject of Colorado Party support for the 
peasants. After the confidential session of the Colorado Party 
Executive Board on 23 February, he reported that the leadership 
of the Colorado Party had decided to come out in support of the 
peasants who are having land problems and are demanding better 
prices for their products, namely, cotton. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Punta Arenas correspondent Pilar Espinosa Ribas] </F>
  [Text] Antarctic Flotilla Commodore Jaime Urdangarin Romero 
on 11 February reported that the first international meeting of 
commanders of Antarctic bases in the South Shetland Islands was 
held at President Frei Base. The meeting's purpose was to reach 
an agreement on measures and draft a plan to combat sea 
pollution, especially that caused by oil slicks. 
  Representatives from Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Peru, 
Brazil, 
Poland, the PRC, the ROK, Russia, and Ecuador who attended the 
meeting committed themselves to asking their respective 
governments to buy the standard antipollution material suggested 
by the Chilean Navy. They decided to draft a concerted action 
program at their next meeting. 
  Commodore Urdangarin stated: "All the participants 
acknowledged that Chile is the only country that has the ways 
and means to combat pollution in the Antarctica in a systematic 
way. We have both the qualified people and the infrastructure 
in the vessels of the Chilean Navy's Antarctic Patrol and the 
Prat Base and Fildes Port Garrison." 
  He underscored that this initiative was materialized by 
Admiral Jorge Martinez Busch, the Navy commander in chief, who 
had the foresight to plan for possible problems arising from the 
increase in sea traffic. 
  On that occasion, the commanders of the bases and stations 
in 
the South Shetland Islands located in Antarctica, agreed to 
appoint the Chilean Navy's Antarctic Patrol as the operations 
coordinator in case of a possible environmental disaster in the 
area. 
  At present, only the Chilean Navy has the necessary vessels, 
equipment, and staff to face an emergency such as this, as well 
as to undertake rescue operations with the Antarctic Patrol.

  [Text] Finance and Economy Vice Minister Alfredo Jaililie 
told EXPRESO that in light of the fact that in 1993 the country 
became once again eligible for receiving funding from 
multilateral organizations (the World Bank, the Inter-American 
Development Bank) it will not be necessary to establish a third 
Support Group this year. 
  This means that we will be able to have access to credit 
facilities, different from bilateral cooperation, for financing 
investment projects. 
  Jaililie moreover explained that the $410 million deficit in 
the balance of payments that had to be covered in 1993 -- which 
entailed having recourse to the second Support Group -- was 
overcome thanks to the aid granted by Japan, which was the only 
country that fulfilled its promise of help in time. 
  Jaililie pointed out that Japan was "the only country that 
staked everything for Peru, and that disbursed exactly the $110 
million it had pledged to give us." He added that this 
contrasts sharply with the United States' attitude, as its 
Congress has raised a number of objections to disbursing its 
$105 million share. 
  As is public knowledge, last year Peru called on countries 
with which it has friendly relations to help it overcome the 
deficit it would incur in its balance of payments. The United 
States and Japan answered this appeal by committing themselves 
to granting us $210 million [as published] of the $410 million 
we needed. The United States would disburse $105 million, and 
Japan $110 million. Some European countries would contribute 
with a smaller share. 
  And yet a year has elapsed, and the United States has not 
yet 
disbursed the promised $105 million because the U.S. Senate has 
charged Peru with violating human rights. Japan on its part has 
punctually paid out its share. 
  Jaililie stated that negotiations with the United States are 
in the hands of Finance and Economy Minister Jorge Camet. The 
only thing that is known about the progress of these 
negotiations is that the U.S. Government -- through AID -- will 
soon disburse $35 million, but nothing has been said about the 
rest of the money. 
  It should be pointed out that the United States is not the 
only one that has failed to honor its commitments. Some 
European countries and international organizations have been 
delaying the disbursement of the funds agreed upon at the 
meeting of the Donors' Board held in Paris in June 1993. 
  To date, the only thing that Peru has been granted is a 
cancellation of its debt with Germany and Switzerland, amounting 
to some $300 million.

board of directors issued a communique announcing that overdue 
accounts have kept the agency from having the necessary liquid 
funds to maintain operations. ANDINA was financed through the 
sale of advertising space to state enterprises. One of the 
agency's main debtors is SUNAT [National Superintendency of Tax 
Administration], which owes ANDINA more than 1 million new soles. 
  ANDINA Information Manager Francisco Perleche said that

<F P=106> [Interview with Economy and Finance Minister Jorge Camet on </F>
the "Saturday Focus" talk show hosted by Journalist Dennis 
Vargas Marin with panelists Ismael Leon of LA REPUBLICA 
newspaper; Augusto Alvarez Rodrich, editor in chief of Apoyo 
publications; and Arturo Salazar Larrain; at the Radio Programas 
studios in Lima -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Vargas] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 
While the country's political affairs continue along their 
course, often in an uncontrolled struggle of ideas of thoughts 
set forth by the defenders of both the government and 
opposition, there is a specific, everyday matter that is always 
put on a back burner; that issue is Peru's economic reality. 
  While the news media, politicians, and leaders discuss human 
rights, the Cantuta law, the sentences in the La Cantuta case, 
and other legal and political issues, the Peruvian people's 
pockets remain a source of concern. 
  I would like to know what economic progress can be expected 
in 1994. Will there be any improvements in our economic 
indexes, apart from inflation, which is something tangible that 
can be seen by all Peruvians and by other countries also? How 
is the recession unfolding; are we defeating it? Is there 
economic reactivation in Peru? Can we say there is light at the 
end of the tunnel? What will happen with pending disbursements, 
international loans, bilateral relations, and relations with 
private commercial banks? 
  I would like to know if indeed this year, as has often been 
said, the economic situation will have any bearing on the 
Peruvian people's pocketbooks. Should this fail to be the case, 
the entire problem will boil down to speeches and theories. I 
would also like to know the terms of Peru's new agreement with 
the IMF. To discuss these and other issues we have invited 
Economy and Finance Minister Jorge Camet, to whom we are 
grateful for his appearance on this program. Good morning, Mr. 
Minister. Welcome to "Saturday Focus." 
  [Camet] Good morning. 
  [Vargas] [passage omitted] Let's take the bull by the horns 
right away. Mr. Minister, I would like to start off with recent 
information and gradually address the country's everyday 
problems. What, exactly, are the terms of Peru's new agreement 
with the IMF, and why is there talk of a new agreement? Does it 
mean there was a discussion or debate over the previous 
agreement which led to changes? Why is the agreement called a 
new agreement with the IMF? 
  [Camet] We have a three-year agreement with the IMF which is 
called an Extended Facility Fund [three previous words in 
English]. However, a program is created every year; therefore, 
we had a 1993 program, and this year we negotiated and discussed 
the 1994 program. The 1995 program will also be discussed. 
  [Vargas] What is the scope of this new program? Has the 
entire program been modified? We all know that the government's 
economic program is executed under the IMF's strict 
surveillance. Are there any conditions in this new agreement? 
  [Camet] We establish goals for the program and we discuss 
them with the IMF. This time our target was inflation of 20 
percent, a growth rate of 4-5 percent, increased international 
reserves of approximately 576 million [no currency specified], 
zero net domestic credit at the BCR [Central Reserve Bank], 
continued fiscal austerity marked by spending from our income, 
and a deficit that can be covered by foreign loans of 
approximately 2.5 percent; I cannot remember the exact figure. 
  The fact of the matter is that the IMF has agreed to all 
our main targets. We discussed differences we had over the use 
of privatization funds and concluded that we could spend 450 
million [currency not specified] on anything we wanted, while 
the remaining funds available to us would be held in reserve, 
because we need to have a certain amount for a Brady Plan down 
payment, which we hope to have by the end of the year. 
  [Vargas] Now it is Augusto Alvarez Rodrich's turn on 
"Saturday Focus." How are you, Augusto? 
  [Alvarez] Good morning, how are you? There are two topics I 
would like to discuss regarding the 1994 program, and one of 
them is taxes. It is clear that Sunat [National Superintendency 
of Tax Administration] has made an effort, but it is also clear 
that the effort is still insufficient compared to what is needed 
and that there is still a knotty side to our economic outlook. 
I would like your impression of how much headway can be made in 
the field of taxes, and what can be changed this year -- 
specifically in terms of those things that have not worked that 
well? 
  [Camet] Augusto Alvarez has broached a very important topic, 
and I appreciate the question. Just as last year, when we 
devoted much attention to inflation, because we believed we 
needed to reduce it as well as reduce expectations of higher 
inflation -- which, in our opinion, was one of the main causes 
of inflation following the cutbacks my predecessors had made -- 
this year the issue is tax collection. Tax collection is 
fundamental. In Peru we have a saying: You cannot have belts 
without leather. Tax collection is critical and basic. Last 
year, tax collection amounted to about 10.5 percent of the GNP; 
this year we estimate it at 12.1 percent. Half-jokingly I have 
said that if Sunat Director Sandro Fuentes only collects 12.1 
percent, I will give him a top grade of 10. Nevertheless, Sunat 
needs to collect considerably more. As a practical measure, we 
have provided Sunat with two new international experts who are 
already working -- one in verification and the other in 
detection -- to cover the most important sources of tax evasion. 
It is not a matter of raising taxes, which are already high; it 
is a matter of reducing tax evasion. [passage omitted] 
  [Alvarez] Mr. Minister, I would like to discuss another 
large 
issue which, like the fiscal issue, is complex -- namely, 
negotiating the foreign debt. According to experts, in the next 
two years the foreign sector could become a source of great 
pressure for the development of the economic plan. My question 
is this: What will the banks be told? Sometimes it seems 
commercial banks expect results that exceed Peru's capacity to 
pay. We are talking about whether Peru can enter a scheme to 
service the debt. The way it stands now, Peru should assign 
about 45 percent of all exports to debt repayments, which is 
impossible. Therefore, what will the banks be told? 
  [Camet] As you all know, we began negotiating with the banks 
in November 1993. We had not been able to do this earlier 
because of the great number of creditors. This forces us to 
assign priorities and enter into agreements with them one at a 
time. We Peruvians should not forget that on 18 March 1992 we 
seriously began to rejoin the world economic system when we 
signed an agreement to update our debts with the IMF and the 
World Bank, thanks to the support received from Japan and the 
United States -- support we should always be grateful for. For 
nearly a year, we have been doing effective and realistic work 
in this area. We do not have the money to repay the banks, and, 
therefore, an honest debtor must offer assets if there is no 
money. Consequently, we offered the banks the ability to 
convert the debt into investments -- an offer that was well 
received in principle after our auditors, such as the IMF, 
certified that it was indeed true that we had no money. It is 
easy to say I have no money, but it is important that this be 
true. 
  [Alvarez, interrupting] Excuse me for interrupting. The 
first point is that there is no possibility of giving the banks 
any money. Was the only option left to exchange debt for 
privatization? 
  [Alvarez] There is no money whatsoever. We have offered them 
the ability to participate in privatizations in part with bonds 
[papeles], because we also need cash, and therefore we will make 
a mixture. We have informed them that case by case, 
privatization by privatization, we will indicate what we feel is 
convenient on how much should be in cash and how much in bonds. 
So far, the only case is Centromin [Central Peru Mining 
Enterprise] with $60 million in bonds against $280 [million] in 
cash. [passage omitted] 
  [De Leon] Mr. Minister, I would like to refer to a specific 
issue with regard to the National Bank. Numerous leaders, among 
whom for example is former President Fernando Belaunde, have 
expressed their concern over the fate of the state bank. As far 
as I know, the government has only made general statements 
regarding the bank's restructuring. Nevertheless, I have some 
information here. I would like to know how you responded to 
Defense Minister Victor Malca last year when he asked you in an 
official note not to close the Puerto Inca banking agency. 
After noting that this is a banking agency that serves the 
people and public employees in this region, Malca asked you to 
reconsider reopening this agency because it is important for 
this region's development. I believe that Minister Malca's 
concern is similar to that of many Peruvians. 
  Continuing with the National Bank issue, I would like you to 
tell us what advantage there was for Peru in withdrawing $33 
million from the Nation Bank's accounts and transferring these 
funds to the Bank Wiese in an operation with Switzerland 
regarding the foreign debt. What is Peru's gain in this, Mr. 
Minister? What is the government's policy in terms of the 
National Bank? 
  I understand that the word restructuring is only a figure of 
speech. Is the bank being closed? Are the bank's powers being 
taken away? Is it no longer a state financial institution? It 
is also almost no longer the institution that collects taxes.... 
What is the government's policy with regard to the National 
Bank? 
  [Camet] Monopolies are never convenient; for starters I will 
take up the tax collection issue. For some time now -- it is 
not measure I implemented, but one that I agree with -- for the 
benefit of the taxpayers, taxes can be paid to the financial 
system in general. Notwithstanding, the National Bank collects 
70 percent of the taxes. The other 30 percent fall within an 
agreement between Sunat with several private banks that have 
accepted the conditions to carry out this task. 
  The National Bank is not going to disappear. The National 
Bank was created during a time convenient for its creation; this 
was the work of Mr. Belaunde. Mr. Belaunde, unfortunately for 
the nation, closed the Deposit and Consignment Bank. The 
National Bank, like many state enterprises, has on one hand 
distorted part of its duties, while on the other it is in a very 
difficult financial situation. This is the main reason why we 
are restructuring the bank, and not as a matter of speech, as 
you may have been informed, Mr. De Leon. 
  We want to preserve it as the Treasury's bank. It has 
fundamental duties, and this is why the National Bank will not 
disappear. Of the 430 branches, 230 are located in remote 
places where it is the sole institution that deals with 
financial matters, although it may only act as tax collector and 
cashier in very poor places where there are no other economic 
activities. 
  [De Leon] Nevertheless, the Puerto Inca agency was closed 
down. General Malca mentioned this in his official note. 
  [Camet] Since the National Bank is the only institution that 
represents the state in those areas, the offices will not be 
closed in those areas. At the same time, however, the National 
Bank must be efficient. At the National Bank there is not only 
a very serious situation concerning where it belongs; it can 
almost be said that the institution is bankrupt to a certain 
extent. I cannot categorically say this; we have people 
analyzing the bank. The National Bank's credit to the public 
enterprises, its enormous passive... [pauses] the bank's passive 
assets total 9 million soles per month, while its active assets 
only total 4 million soles per month. Do you realize the 
magnitude of these figures I am presenting to you? I do not 
want to give you any more figures because I do not yet have the 
final report. [passage omitted] 
  [De Leon] [passage omitted] Once again I ask you, what is 
the 
advantage for the National Bank to have $33 million withdrawn 
from its funds upon orders of Mr. [name indistinct] to be 
subsequently deposited -- it specifically says here -- in the 
Wiese Bank. 
  [Camet] Look here Mr. de Leon, I have known you for some 
time, you are an excellent reporter.... 
  [De Leon, interrupting] Thank you sir. 
  [Camet] I know you from Confiep [National Confederation of 
Private Business]. I am going to explain to you this specific 
case because I see you have been given information -- not 
distorted but definitely biased. I am going to explain to you 
this case. In the Donors Club in Paris we were offered by the 
consulting group loans or donations for two years to the amount 
of $900 million to address poverty. A fundamental aspect of our 
program is to diminish poverty. We were offered through 
donations that are already being made effective. [sentence as 
heard] 
  The case you mentioned is related to Switzerland's forgiving 
of our debt of $130 million. This pardon demanded the deposit 
of approximately $30 million by Peru. The donor demanded that 
this sum be deposited in a private bank. Well, if the donor 
forgives us $130 million conditioned to the deposit of $30 
million in a private bank, I will most certainly deposit this in 
a private bank sooner rather than later. This is what has been 
reported to you in a biased fashion. 
  [De Leon] I do not seen that it is so biased. [Words 
indistinct, Camet and De Leon speaking simultaneously] I 
understand that a negotiator is precisely that. I believe that, 
for example, the Continental Bank and the Interbank are state 
banks but legally they can operate as private banks.... 
  [Camet, interrupting] If the donor [words indistinct with de 
Leon and Camet speaking simultaneously]. If the donor demands 
that the funds not be deposited in a mixed bank either, well, 
for a $130-million donation to Peru, we place $30 million in a 
private bank, just as is demanded by the donor. Mr. [name 
indistinct] only chairs a four- to five-member committee which 
oversees the negotiations with the donor. 
  [Salazar] Mr. Minister, I would like to ask you about a 
couple of specific things. I believe there are two main 
stabilizing elements in the economy: interest rates and the 
exchange rate. What plans are there for 1994 in these areas? A 
second question: You have said you will fire Sunat Director 
Sandro Fuentes if the GNP does not grow from 10.5 percent to 
12.1 percent, which is really a 1.6 percent GNP growth. If you 
are expecting the GNP to gain five points during 1994, as you 
have predicted, why make the statement in the first place? 
Last, sir, you say you would like to hire international experts 
to prevent tax evasion. Perhaps you are not aware, but reports 
I have seen just recently state that tax evasion is on the rise 
all over the world. In the United States, particularly, evasion 
is growing enormously. What kind of international experts are 
you planning to bring in? 
  [Camet] Thank you. Regarding interest rates, unfortunately 
these are still high. I believe the financial system in general 
took a while to adjust and readapt. This area did take a lesser 
beating from the economic readjustment plan than other areas 
did, and interest rates are slowly but surely falling. 
  I have several studies on the exchange rate situation I am 
examining at this time. They demonstrate that, if in fact there 
has been some degree of dragging in this process, the difference 
has been no greater than 10 points. This is a very 
controversial issue. This year we expect to gain three points 
with respect to parity, and I hope we do. The exchange rate at 
this time is seasonably stable. This has become quite a regular 
thing for this time of year. I remember that in 1992 we lost a 
lot of ground with respect to parity. This loss, however, came 
because of the excessive increases we had during 1992, when we 
gained 10 percent, which led us to heavy inflation in the first 
quarter of 1993. I believe it is rather conservative to speak 
of a 4 or 5 percent growth of the GNP. I think it will be more 
than that. I hope it will be more. 
  Regarding the international experts on controlling and 
reducing tax evasion, we are not going to hire them. They are 
already working. These are people with great experience. One 
had extensive experience in Chile. His specialty is auditing. 
This individual is a very good adjunct. We also have experts 
working on internal organizations and preparing control systems 
for interagency communications via computer. Our people also 
worked well to establish the taxpayer registration number. 
  [Salazar] What I meant was this: If the overall GNP is 
going to grow more than 5 percent, then the 10.5 percent 
increase in tax collection would provide greater income. An 
increase from 6 percent to 10.5 percent would mean greater tax 
collection. Why does the state need greater tax collection if 
you said the budget will be kept within austerity limits? 
  [Camet] Better tax collection means more solutions for 
poverty than what we are able to provide now. We will be able 
to increase public investment. 
  [Salazar] Public investment perhaps, but there is not very 
much room for ending poverty or for improving social spending, 
right? This would mean programs that are not currently 
included in the budget. 
  [Camet] If you add loans, certain figures in the budget, and 
social spending coordination -- which Alfonso Bustamante started 
and we will continue -- you will find that at least 3 percent of 
the GNP is dedicated to poverty within the budget's current 
parameters. 
  [Salazar] That is really not all that impressive, you know. 
  [Camet] When seen by the one who collected that 10.5 percent 
last year, it is almost one-third. That is a significant effort 
in itself. We could only have achieved this now that the 
economy is beginning to move in the direction you all are 
witnessing. 
  [Salazar] There have been greater allotments for other types 
of spending than social spending. 
  [Camet] We have cut back on basic expenditures, but this 
area still represents 7 percent. 
  [Salazar] Defense, for example, is much greater than social 
spending, is it not? 
  [Camet] No, it is not greater. Please bear in mind that 
Peru no longer buys a single tank or a single fighter plane. 
Peru is only buying equipment for its domestic needs, which is 
all light equipment. [passage omitted]

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Peru monitored through 17 
February. 
  The auction of the Ilo copper processing plant was suspended 
on 2 February after the three companies that won the 
international bid declined to submit their offers in the face of 
the $70 million base price proposed by the government. They also 
were compelled to make a $20 million minimum investment. (Lima 
LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 3 Feb 94 p 8) 
  The Economy and Finance Ministry on 11 February assumed 
responsibility for the total foreign medium- and long-range debt 
of National Telecommunications Enterprise Peru, Entel Peru, as a 
step to its privatization, which will begin on 28 February. So 
far there are five consortiums interested in buying Entel and 
the Peruvian Telephone Company, CPT. The base price is $525 
million, of which $190 million will be used to increase CPT's 
capital and the remainder will be divided between CPT and Entel.

  [Excerpts] The National Counterterrorism Directorate 
[Dincote] on 10 February confirmed the definite division of the 
Shining Path into two antagonistic factions, which could lead to 
the subversive organization's total defeat. [passage omitted] 
  Police also discovered a Shining Path training camp the 
so-called "People's Liberation Army" and "People's Help" had 
been using for training, physical preparation, and the use of 
guns and explosives. 
  Police reported on 10 February that the training camp was 
located at the top of Casablanca Hill, in the Jose Carlos 
Mariategui shantytown, near Miguel Castro Castro prison in San 
Juan de Lurigancho. 
  During the raid on the area, police found explosives and the 
inscriptions of the aliases of the 10 [number as published] 
alleged terrorists arrested. 
  According to the Dincote report, they have been identified 
as 
Miriam Tarazona Trujillo (21), alias "Rocio," and Jorge Manuel 
Linares Bustamante, 25, alias "Francisco" or "Santiago." The two 
are members of the PCP-SL [Peruvian Communist Party-Shining 
Path] defense department "leadership cell." 
  Police agents presented to the press the following 
individuals as "People's Liberation Army members:" Rolando 
Hector Limachi Arevalo, alias "John," responsible for the 
southern zone; Marco Antonio Huamani Soriano, alias "Mario," 
from the political command; and Shiomara Velasco Chavez, alias 
"Edith," from the military command. 
  Police also presented "combatants" Miguel Angle Santillan 
Coronel, alias "Jefri;" Jesus Honorato Alfaro Barrientos, alias 
"Helton;" Oswaldo Cuya Garcia, alias "Luis;" and Carmen Consuelo 
Llanos Inga, alias "Laura." 
  Also presented in striped uniforms were communicators 
Alejandro Arturo Mayta Manrique, 33, handicapped -- he walks 
with an orthopedic leg with a lot of difficulty; and Jose Carlos 
Lopez Torres, 25. 
  According to Dincote, the last two are allegedly members of 
the Shining Path's "People's Help" apparatus support department 
(health section). 
  The Dincote agents stressed that with the arrest of these 
individuals, police neutralized terrorist activities being 
planned for metropolitan Lima's southern area. 
  In the individuals' possession police found six sketches of 
streets, markets, and religious temples drawn by the PCP-SL 
People's Guerrilla Army to be used in the sabotage of bank 
offices and Pension Fund Administration (AFP) offices, and to 
paint walls, distribute pamphlets, and murder policemen. 
  Dincote charged the arrested subversives with the 
destruction 
of five bank branches, Guido de Surquillo's bakery in San Juan 
de Miraflores municipality, and the frustrated homicide of a PNP 
[Peruvian National Police] lieutenant whose last name is Valle. 
  They also were held responsible for the sabotage against the 
Peruvian Radio Television (Channel 7) station and Latin 
Frequency (Channel 2) building on 14 January 1991 and 5 June 
1992, respectively.

  [Text] Shining Path [SL] top leader Abimael Guzman Reynoso, 
who personally conducted the organization for 13 years of blood 
and terror in his insane idea of "conquering power," has become 
the "executioner" of this terrorist group by creating a deep 
split among the organization members. This split was a result of 
Guzman's letters calling for "a peace accord" to end the 
"fratricidal war." 
  The "II Party Congress," which will be held in March 
somewhere in Lima, will debate the proposals made by the 
opposing factions. The possibility of giving up violence in the 
near future, however, is discarded. 
  One of the factions is the "Right-Wing Opportunist Line 
(LOD) 
[Linea Oportunista de Derecha]" or "Revisionist" faction, which 
is comprised of individuals who support the SL top leader and 
agree with his decision. 
  Edmundo Cox Beuzeville, Nelly Evans Risco de Alvarez 
Calderon, and Osman Morote Barrionuevo, aka "Remigio" -- who are 
some of the subversive group's best-known members -- also are 
part of this faction. 
  By adopting this position, they seek to avoid an inexorable 
defeat. Before this occurs, they believe they must abandon their 
principles to preserve the movement. 
  The other faction is the "Left-Wing Liquidationist Line 
(LLI) 
[Linea Liquidacionista de Izquierda]," the members of which are 
known as "Perfidios." This faction is comprised of the so-called 
"Recalcitrantes," who do not support or agree with the "peace 
accord." They thus ignore the obedience and subordination vows 
they made to "Presidente Gonzalo." 
  According to documents seized and recent SL "Central 
Committee" re-transmissions, as well as testimony by captured 
terrorists, the SL "hard" line on 7 February started the "second 
offensive" of the "second campaign." 
  The escalation of violence began with an attack against the 
Peruvian Air Force's central barracks on 28 de Julio Avenue on 
that day. 
  This faction is supported by Catalina Adrianzen S., wife of 
SL ideologist Antonio Diaz Martinez; and SL leaders Alberto 
Ramirez Durand, aka "Feliciano;" Margie Clavo Peralta; and 
Isabel Rengifo Saavedra; among others. 
  Other terrorists who also support this faction are: Laura 
Zambrano Padilla, aka "Meche;" Martha Huatay Ruiz, aka "Rosa;" 
and Teresa Durand Araujo (Osman Morote Barrionuevo's wife); 
among others. 
  Many of the criminals being held at the Chorrillos women's 
jail also belong to the "Recalcitrantes" faction. The same is 
true of a few criminals held at "Miguel Castro Castro" jail in 
Canto Grande. 
  The "hardness" of the "Perfidios" in these two jails has not 
changed as a result of visits made to them in the last few 
months by high-ranking SL leaders such as Elena Iparraguirre 
Revoredo, aka "Miriam," or Abimael Guzman Reynoso. 
  Guzman's Message Found 
  Peruvian National Police [PNP] sources reported the 
discovery 
of a message Guzman handed to Martha Huatay Ruiz, aka "Rosa," 
when she visited him at the Navy prison in Callao Port. 
  Huatay hid the message in her genitals and handed it to a 
relative who visited her at the "Yanamayo" jail in Puno. This 
relative was finally arrested by the PNP. 
  The message, which was written on a small piece of paper, 
said among other things: "My arrest is a turn in the path. Join 
the masses; the people will win." 
  This report has not been confirmed or denied by the PNP. It 
shows, nonetheless, the way Guzman is using the government 
officials who have been trying to end the violence that has been 
reigning in the country for the last 13 years.

  [Text] Lima, 1 Mar (EFE) -- Daniel Espichan Tumay, the 
Republic of Peru's special prosecutor for terrorist crimes, 
stressed today that by 18 February 1,699 terrorists had sought 
shelter under the Repentance Law issued by the government. 
  The prosecutor added that 1,055 belong to the Shining Path 
Maoist gang and 644 to the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement 
(MRTA). 
  The prosecutor noted that thus far five repented terrorists 
have left Peru under a new identity in order to lead a different 
life in another country, thanks to the valuable information they 
supplied that allowed the breaking up of subversive groups. 
  Espichan added that he has been concerned about the defense 
of eight journalists under arrest for allegedly promoting 
terrorist crimes who belonged to the newspaper DIARIO DE MARKA, 
a leftist newspaper seized by the Shining Path that now 
circulates clandestinely from time to time in a very small 
format. 
  The Republic of Peru's special prosecutor pointed out that 
he 
has constantly been in touch with Journalists Association head 
Miguel Calderon Paz in order to individually handle the cases 
involving these journalists and quickly secure the release of 
those journalists who are not criminally liable. 
  The prosecutor also has recommended painstakingly checking 
reports supplied by the repented terrorists because some of them 
have been false and led to the detention of innocent people.

thought two weeks ago. In fact, "an error" by the Ramon J. 
Velasquez administration led to a miscalculation in the interest 
payments on the foreign debt. In the 1994 budget, the previous 
administration estimated a payment of 300 billion bolivares when 
the figure truly is 370 billion. 
  In addition, Vivas Teran explained that 340 billion 
bolivares 
worth of expenses were not included in the budget. President 
Velasquez approved these funds for universities and for an 
increase in salaries for public employees. However, the funds 
basically had no source of income backing them. Consequently, 
they will be cut by nearly 50 percent. This situation prompted 
Vivas Teran to say that the fiscal deficit for the public sector 
ranges between 8 and 10 percent of the GNP instead of 4 percent 
as the Finance Ministry reported. 
  This means that the fiscal deficit is between 560 and 700 
billion bolivares, taking into account that each point of the 
GNP is equivalent to 70 billion bolivares. 
  The FIV president agrees with Finance Minister Julio Sosa 
Rodriguez who said the fiscal gap will be reduced to 2 percent 
of the GNP by year's end. However, the sources for financing 
the budget are limited. 
  Vivas Teran said he is aware that an estimated 70 billion 
bolivares were included in the 1994 budget as an adjustment in 
the price of fuel. However, the Caldera government has already 
rejected this measure. Furthermore, the crisis in the oil 
market will prevent the country from receiving 200-250 billion 
bolivares in revenues to the point that the Venezuelan export 
package is estimated at $11.50 [as published]. 
  In addition, revenues for 70 billion bolivares were 
estimated 
through an issuance of Treasury bonds; however, according to 
general budget regulations, such a measure can only be applied 
when there are no indirect taxes. Privatization cannot be used 
as a way to obtain revenues because funds obtained from the sale 
of state assets in 1994 can only be used in 1995, but not to 
cover regular expenses. 
  In the face of this, Sosa Rogriguez maintained that the plan 
named after him will only generate 150 billion bolivares. The 
government will decide on the feasibility of applying a tax on 
bank debits within 10 days. 
  It must be stressed that if bank transactions are taxed, the 
government could collect approximately 70 billion bolivares, 
which is exactly the amount that was not included in the budget 
due to a miscalculation in the foreign debt service for 1994. 
  Vivas Teran reiterated that the government will continue to 
reduce budgeted expenditures by as much as 15 percent. This 
represents 210 billion bolivares if it is considered that the 
balance between revenues and expenses for this year amounts to 
1.435 trillion bolivares. Nevertheless, Sosa Rodriguez admitted 
on Wednesday at the Council of Ministers meeting that his 
ministry was barely able to make 110 billion bolivares in cuts, 
less than 10 percent of the budgeted expenses. 
  In sum, this is "what we have been able to do after 
assessing 
the country's finances. We want the country to know, without 
euphemisms, the exact dimension of the problems our nation is 
facing. The central government's deficit is approximately 8 
percent of the GNP." 
  This same situation, Vivas Teran noted, is what has led the 
finance minister to be very cautious and "to take his time 
because, often, there are many unexpected ways in which a fiscal 
deficit can increase."

  [Text] Gustavo Rossen, chairman of the Banco Latino 
intervention board, announced the beginning of the financial 
institution's recovery process. The process will begin next 
week and will proceed in accordance with Article 234 of the 
General Banking Law. 
  The statute, which was approved for discussion by the 
Venezuelan Central Bank, allows the bank to move from the 
intervention stage to the recovery stage. The decision was 
based on a report on the banks assets, prepared by the General 
Bank Superintendency last November. The report determined the 
lost capital and allows the process to continue without waiting 
for the final results of the official audit, which has not yet 
totaled the trust funds deposited at National Bank of Curacao. 
  Now the missing Banco Latino assets have been posted as lost 
funds, the Deposit Guarantee Fund, Fogade, will provide the 
financial institution with funds. The liquidity injection will 
be at no cost to Banco Latino, because it will be a capital 
investment, thus making Fogade the bank's new owner. These 
funds will allow Banco Latino to operate normally and begin its 
recovery process, which entails much more than paying back its 
depositors. The process could also restore the account holders' 
trust in the financial institution and prevent them from 
withdrawing all of their money. This would also improve the 
quality of the bank's assets, from the perspective of 
privatization. 
  Rossen explained that in a normal situation such as this, 
the 
Intervention Board can now try to improve the quality of the 
bank's credit portfolio. To this end, the board has proposed 
several measures to be included in the Emergency Law being 
drafted by Congress. "Our proposals will turn loans into liquid 
funds, and enhance investments, thus allowing us to resume 
payment of the bank's obligations. If we could not count on the 
income from such collections as a key element toward recovery, 
we would have to resort to additional subsidies and bail out 
money." 
  Rossen underscored the importance of the Emergency Law being 
drafted in Congress, because it will allow the bank to resume 
payments to its savings account holders. Noteworthy is the fact 
that there are 21 billion bolivares at the Central Bank. Only 9 
billion have been paid out, while 12 billion are being held in 
escrow, because the bank has been unable to provide Fogade with 
funds in the amounts it has demanded. 
  In addition to the beginning of the recovery process at 
Banco 
Latino, the Intervention Board will also begin collecting the 
bank's outstanding receivables, starting with exchange notes, 
and continuing with credit card balances. Rossen announced that 
the board has not ruled out the possibility of many account 
holders becoming shareholders of the financial institution. "We 
would have to open a negotiation process to start making yearly 
disbursements of 1 million bolivares to those people with large 
deposits, in the form of preferential cumulative dividend 
shares. The nature and value of such negotiable documents would 
change in the secondary markets, in such a case as the 
institution being sold to a foreign bank." 
  The various payment formulas currently under study will 
allow 
us to improve the banks receivables and future selling 
qualities, and provide ways for the State to recover what it has 
invested in the institution, within approximately five years.

  [Text] Gustavo Tarre Briceno, chairman of the Congressional 
Finance Commission, announced that the draft of the emergency 
law that will apply to the Banco Latino case will be ready today. 
  Meanwhile, Gustavo Roosen, president of the bank's 
intervention board, said that the emergency law establishes 
financial aid for Banco Latino, something that will allow the 
implementation this week of strategies for the bank's 
rehabilitation. Roosen explained that the banking law that has 
been in effect since the beginning of this year envisages a 
rehabilitation phase as long as the rules set by the Bank 
Superintendency and the Deposit Guarantee Fund during the 
intervention phase are followed. Roosen said the bank has lost 
150 billion bolivares, an amount that can increase or diminish 
depending on the work carried out by the current intervention 
board.

  [Text] Jose Ignacio Moreno Leon, the adviser to the finance 
minister, has stated that the suspension of economic guarantees 
is temporary. He also referred to objections raised by the 
World Bank and explained that these are not a result of the 
steps taken by the national government. 
  Moreno Leon said the measure to eliminate the VAT 
[value-added tax] cannot be described as confusing because, no 
matter what, the government will submit to Congress in the next 
few days a bill establishing a tax on luxury items and wholesale 
goods. These are measures that will replace the VAT while the 
implementation of the VAT on wholesale goods continues. 
  Moreno Leon added that the idea is to establish a modern tax 
structure that will allow the nation to close the fiscal gap, 
put an end to the spiraling inflation rate, and, ultimately, 
reduce the inflation rate. In terms of rates for bank debits, 
the idea is to implement a 2-percent rate, but with a 31 
December time limit because the rate would eventually be 
replaced by a rate outlined within the new income tax law. 
  He concluded by noting that the state will fulfill its role 
of safeguarding the common good, which is a duty that cannot be 
delegated. The government views economic development as a goal 
of social justice. 
  [Begin Moreno Leon recording] The government has been given 
greater flexibility to continue to modernize the economy, while 
attempting, as its main objective, to help the country as a 
whole, rejecting the creation of special privileges. The 
government must fight those who distort the market in order to 
make the development that results from modernization one based 
on social justice. [end recording] 
  In conclusion, the adviser said that currency control has 
been ruled out completely.

  [Text] The Confederation of Venezuelan Workers [CTV] backs 
the government's decision to decree the suspension of economic 
guarantees. Antonio Rios made this statement, noting that the 
CTV will maintain this position as long as the measure helps 
combat speculation. 
  Rios disclosed that he will deliver to the president a 
document containing the conclusions reached by the CTV after an 
assessment of the country's political, economic, and social 
situation, specifically in light of the workers. 
  In this regard, Rios noted that the document includes 
several 
recommendations made by the CTV in the face of the crisis. The 
recommendations include fighting inflation, better public 
services, the guarantee of a comprehensive social security 
system, and the creation and protection of jobs --jobs that 
should be the key issue in the permanent dialogue among the 
government, management, and organized labor. 
  [Begin Rios recording] We feel that the suspension of 
guarantees is good for workers and the people because they do 
not have to worry about speculation or an increase in the 
inflation rate because the government had to utilize its 
resources to cover the deficit. These deficits are being 
created while the government solves problems such as those 
presented by Banco Latino or other banks that might require its 
attention. [end recording] 
  In terms of the CTV stand on an increase in the minimum 
wage, 
Rios reiterated that it should be closely linked to the prices 
of the basic food basket.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 1 
March. 
  The manufacturing industry suffered a 1.4-percent reduction 
in 1993 while the petrochemical sector suffered a 0.56-percent 
reduction. There was, however, a 10.6-percent decrease in this 
sector's imports and an increase in its exports, and this 
contributed to the sector having a more bearable negative trade 
balance. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 24 Feb 94 p E-10) 
  The Federation of Industries on 24 February presented to 
President Rafael Caldera a plan for the creation of 20,000 new 
small and mid-size industrial plants that, according to 
spokesmen for the federation, would generate more than 1 million 
jobs. (Caracas Venezolana de Television Network in Spanish 2350 
GMT 24 Feb 94) 
  Energy and Mines Minister Erwin Jose Arrieta has said that 
the reduction in the production of crude oil does not guarantee 
that oil prices would increase. Arrieta said that at the OPEC 
meeting to take place soon in Geneva, he will insist that OPEC 
reassume its role as harmonizer of the oil policy of the various 
oil producing countries. Arrieta said he is optimistic about 
the negotiations Venezuela is holding with the British and U.S. 
Governments on refined gasoline. (Caracas Venezolana de 
Television Network in Spanish 2350 GMT 25 Feb 94) 
  The latest report issued by the Central Bank of Venezuela 
reveals that the Venezuelan financial market continues to have 
liquidity problems. The report reveals that the Central Bank's 
credit assistance for the week that concluded on 11 February was 
126.824 billion bolivares, 28.888 billion more than for the week 
that ended on 4 February. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in 
Spanish 25 Feb 94 p 8) 
  Venezuela's trade deficit situation with regard to Mexico 
and 
Colombia remains unchanged, but for the first time in history, 
Venezuela's printing industry is exporting to these two Latin 
American countries, giants in this industrial sector. (Caracas 
EL NACIONAL in Spanish 26 Feb 94 p E-6)

  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- Eduardo Facusse, president of the 
Tegucigalpa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCIT), denounced 
yesterday U.S. labor organizations for financing campaigns to 
destabilize Honduras. 
  Facusse made the disclosure during a speech at the CCIT's 
ordinary assembly, during which he discussed the problems that 
manufacturing firms are facing. 
  "Mistaken labor leaders are raising new flags of nationalism 
inspired and propelled by foreign currency. U.S. labor unions 
are financing campaigns to destabilize Honduras with results 
that should worry us all, especially Honduran workers," he said. 
  Facusse said in light of the unions' destructive eagerness, 
no foreign company will establish itself in Honduras, and those 
already established here will move to other countries, thus 
causing us to lose 40,000 jobs. 
  Facusse also said the price of the lempira in comparison to 
the dollar should fluctuate constantly, as do the European 
currencies and the Japanese yen. 
  He expressed satisfaction over the decision by President 
Carlos Roberto Reina's government to officially devaluate the 
lempira, which, unofficially, remains at two to one. 
  Facusse said the prices of European currencies and the yen 
"fluctuate constantly on the international market, and I see no 
reason why the lempira should not do the same; furthermore, this 
situation is having a tremendous effect on the country's 
imports, which have been continually subsidized and have 
complicated Honduras' balance of properties and services, 
thereby contributing to the continuous deterioration of the 
lempira." 
  "We must export more but, unfortunately, we have not been 
doing this due to a number of circumstances. If the lempira is 
officially devaluated, which may happen, imports will 
concurrently decrease." 
  Facusse said with implementation of the customs value factor 
(FVA), which is a fiscal mechanism, the currency has been 
undergoing continuous devaluations due to speculation. 
  The FVA, he added, "has not been to our advantage; we have 
used it to promote imports, and the commercial deficit may reach 
approximately $450 million, which we are going to have to pay, 
and we lack the foreign currency to do so."

<F P=106> [State of the Nation Address by President Guillermo Endara </F>
at the Legislative Palace in Panama City -- live] 
  [Text] Your Excellencies Arturo Vallarino, president of the 
Legislative Assembly; Dr. Arturo Hoyos, president of the Supreme 
Court of Justice; Vice President Guillermo Ford Boyd; Mr. 
Ministers and Deputy Ministers; Mr. Comptroller General and 
Deputy Comptroller General; Reverend Oscar Brown, auxiliary 
bishop of Panama; honorable Attorney General and Solicitor 
General; honorable Supreme Court of Justice Magistrates; 
honorable Electoral Tribunal Magistrates; Governors; Mayors of 
Panama City and San Miguelito Districts; directors, managers, 
deputy directors, and assistant managers of decentralized 
agencies; special guests; members of the local and foreign 
media; ladies and gentlemen: 
  This is the ninth and last time I will appear before you to 
fulfill my constitutional obligation of addressing you at the 
beginning of each legislative period to deliver a message on 
administrative matters. The next time I come to this arena, in 
six months, I will be doing it to deliver the presidential sash 
to the president the people will freely elect in May. At that 
time, the Legislative Assembly will comprise citizens who enjoy 
the approval of the majority of their voters. Because of this, 
the legislative period that begins today provides the current 
Legislative Assembly with a final opportunity to discuss the 
important bills it still has to discuss. Whatever is not done 
within the next four months will be left as unconcluded work by 
the representatives who were elected in 1989. 
  This is why I want to begin my speech by encouraging you to 
make this last phase of the mandate you received a constructive 
phase in every sense for the benefit of the Panamanian people. 
  Exactly four years ago I addressed you for the first time. 
The Legislative Assembly was belatedly installed on that day 
and that installation marked the beginning of the relationship 
the legislative and executive branches have maintained. In my 
opinion, this relationship shows a positive balance. We have 
made conscious efforts to work in a reasonably harmonious way. 
We have also been aware of the limits imposed by our respective 
state branches. 
  Throughout these years, in my eight previous speeches at 
this 
assembly, I have touched on several issues. Some of them were 
reiterations. On other occasions I discussed issues that at a 
given moment were of special interest. 
  I have repeatedly spoken about the critical situation under 
which we assumed the government and about the chaos in which we 
found the country at the end of 1989 and the beginning of 1990. 
We have spoken about serious maladjustments in state finances 
and about the enormous foreign debt burden we inherited from the 
past regime. 
  We have spoken about the depths of unemployment and poverty 
into which we were plunged and about the continuous efforts we 
have made since then to mitigate these problems in the short-, 
mid-, and long- term. 
  We have spoken about how necessary it is to encourage our 
worn out economy and about the predominant role the private 
sector has as an engine of economic recovery and development. 
  We have spoken about the functions of the state and about 
the 
size of the state in relation to private activities. We have 
discussed specific actions we have adopted in this regard. 
  We have discussed public security and the social peace we 
want and have been building despite the obstacles we faced. 
  We have discussed democracy, the creation of a de jure 
state, 
civil liberties, especially freedom of expression and respect 
for the independence and separation of the state branches. 
  We have spoken about my conviction that it is necessary to 
produce a clean and fair elections campaign and to deliver power 
to the legitimate winner of the elections. 
  Other issues also have been the source of special interest 
in 
my messages at the beginning of each legislative period. 
  Among these issues I must mention the urgent and pressing 
need to save the Social Security Bank, which was heading for 
bankruptcy because of past mismanagement; the creation of the 
Interoceanic Region Authority to manage those assets that have 
been returned and will be returned; the amendment to the 
Constitution to create the Panama Canal Administration that will 
pave the road for assuming control of the canal at the end of 
the century; and the basic law for the existence of a 
police-minded, not military-minded, public force as an important 
tool for guaranteeing public security and peace. 
  Other issues we have discussed are the administrative career 
law to give public employees stability and peace of mind; the 
reforms to the electoral code that will be in effect for the 
current elections; and the approval of the family code and the 
health code -- both tools of great importance for protecting 
society's basic core as well as the Panamanian people's health. 
  We have discussed many other but no less important issues. 
  I am very pleased to see that these proposals, which on 
occasion have been the key or most important part of my messages 
to this honorable assembly, have received priority attention. 
Many were approved by you. They were presented for your 
consideration as initiatives of the executive branch, and most 
of them are already laws of the Republic. They have been an 
important part in the process to reconstruct nation of Panama 
and its institutions. 
  Today I want to stress a bill that is on your legislative 
agenda. This bill is inspired by the legal duties that officials 
charged with enforcing and interpreting the law fulfill on a 
daily basis. In addition, various social sectors directly 
affected by related crimes have made recommendations. With this 
bill, an attempt is being made to amend Law 23 of 1986 and some 
provisions of the penal code. All of this is being made to make 
more effective the struggle against the scourge of drug abuse 
and narcotics trafficking. 
  This topic is very important. It is, unfortunately, a very 
current issue. During the last legislative period, you ratified 
the Vienna Convention on drugs and money laundering. This was 
another important step to establish, once more, Panama's 
commitment in the international struggle against these evils. 
The 1988 Vienna Convention -- the name used to identify the 
convention against the illegal trafficking of drugs and 
psychotropic substances approved by the United Nations -- is one 
aspect of our country's commitment within international 
cooperation. To this we must add the agreements signed with the 
United States of America, the United Kingdom and Northern 
Ireland, Colombia, and all the Central American republics to 
collaborate in the eradication of the illegal trafficking of 
drugs and psychotropic substances to prevent the shipment of 
chemicals and basic substances and, in general, to provide legal 
assistance in connection with drug trafficking and other crimes. 
  Currently, we are extending this network of international 
agreements on this same matter through negotiations that have 
gotten under way with Canada, Mexico, and the Russian Federation. 
  On this occasion, we have to make further progress with the 
approval of new internal regulations against drug trafficking 
and money laundering. For several years, we have discussed a 
possible review of existing legislation on this topic. 
  The Legislative Assembly's Drug Commission began this 
process 
in 1991. The Attorney General's Office presented a bill during 
the previous legislative period. If changes proposed to 
existing laws are approved, we will have comprehensive 
guidelines to modernize and consolidate the legal basis needed 
for this struggle. 
  We cannot deny this reality: Panama is threatened by drug 
trafficking, drug abuse, and money laundering. We are not the 
only ones to suffer the dangers and consequences of these evils, 
but we cannot find consolation in this fact. The Panamanian 
people have repeatedly expressed their concern over the fact 
that drugs could be undermining the foundations of our society. 
  The Panamanian Government also has expressed this same 
concern several times at various international forums. The 
health and welfare of a generation of young Panamanians is at 
stake. The future of this nation rests on the shoulders of 
these Panamanians. In addition, we are witnessing, with great 
surprise, a new wave of murder, kidnapping, and other crimes 
that are characterized by a special kind of cruelty and savagery. 
  Without a doubt, these crimes are directly linked to this 
imported scourge. Legitimate economic and financial activities 
in our country are overshadowed by money-laundering activities. 
Drug traffickers act against our sovereignty when they make a 
mockery of our borders and economic institutions and try to buy 
people and influence with their dirty money. 
  My words are not exaggerated one bit. Quite the contrary, I 
am understating the situation. This is a sad and dangerous 
reality, and we cannot allow this to happen. The people demand 
that you -- men and women who have been elected to serve society 
-- take action on this matter. Mothers in Santiago, Bocas del 
Toro, and Penonome; teachers in Chitre and David; honest bankers 
in Panama City; policemen in Colon, Darien, and Los Santos -- 
all of them demand action against this evil of our times and 
demand the approval of the necessary tools to fight it. These 
legal instruments will not by themselves solve the problem 
completely. They must be enforced by able, devoted, honest, and 
well-paid officials. Ample economic resources are also 
required. Nevertheless, strict and effective legislation is 
essential to avert an unfair fight. 
  The country is in the middle of an important election 
campaign. The new legislation that you deputies are to debate 
does not entail political purposes. This legislation has not 
originated in any political party and favors no special 
interests. Quite the contrary, it benefits all Panamanians. 
Our fellow citizens demand and deserve the approval of this 
legislation. 
  I wish to refer briefly to some of the items that may be 
good 
to introduce into legislation extant. These items are included 
in the recommendations presented by the Attorney General's 
Office and supported by various sectors of society. 
  In the first place, to investigate these crimes it is 
necessary for our legislation to include canons on two settings 
that it currently does not envisage: the undercover agent and 
controlled deliveries. Both are necessary to be able to 
infiltrate international mafia bands and to destroy them with 
overwhelming evidence obtained from within the criminal 
organizations themselves. 
  Next, it is necessary to apply stiffer measures, other than 
preventive detention, on those found guilty of drug trafficking 
or related crimes. We cannot deceive ourselves. We must admit 
that this business moves plenty of dirty money. This money 
starts to move as soon as a drug trafficker is apprehended and 
sent to prison. He starts to make his tempting moves 
immediately, determined to buy any weak consciences available to 
him or which succumb to his dishonest approaches. For this 
reason, it is necessary that only magistrates may lift 
preliminary measures, such as preventive detention. The 
magistrates will be made fully responsible for their actions. 
  Third, we must admit that profits can be made in this 
business, not only in cash, but in other assets, negotiable 
certificates, securities, or goods. All of these can be 
laundered and, in turn, must be confiscated. 
  Fourth, it is necessary to revise the structure of the 
agency 
that conducts investigations on drug trafficking cases. 
Presently, the Drug Secretariat through a single office 
investigates all drug- and money-laundering related crimes. The 
accumulation of files and the bottleneck are evident. It is 
necessary to decentralize functions to make the punishment of 
criminals more expeditious and effective. Also, the situation 
of drug addicts has not been overlooked in the project. 
  We must offer alternatives for their rehabilitation and, 
later, for their rejoining of society. To this effect, we have 
been planning that all of these goods, instruments, or valuables 
that have been seized in these cases be turned over to the 
National Commission for the Study and Prevention of Drug-Related 
Crimes. This commission would then assign them to the government 
or nongovernmental institutions that form part of it, or will 
put them up for public bidding in order to create a common fund 
for campaigns and programs for the prevention, rehabilitation, 
and repression of these crimes. 
  Last, I want to specifically point out a new measure in our 
penal code. Not only is it new, but in addition it is needed 
immediately. I am referring to the new measure that will 
establish penalties for using money or any illegal financial 
resources coming from drug trafficking to finance political 
campaigns. This measure, which would be new in terms of 
legislation of this kind, would be designed to alert us against 
the temptation of willingly ruining the exercise of free 
democracy. Such links would be shameful and denigrating. Let it 
be clearly understood by narcotics traffickers that in times of 
democracy their shameful money is never welcome, and much less 
welcome in Panamanian political campaigns. Let the drug barons 
know that in Panama there is a definite political determination 
that rejects their activities and their money. 
  Mr. President, honorable legislators: I want to recall the 
words I said here on 1 September 1990, more than three years 
ago. I said the following, and I quote: Allow me also to voice 
my pleasure over the fact that finally the three branches of 
state have managed to form the Electoral Tribunal. We have done 
this with honorable and qualified citizens. I have great faith 
in the honesty, independent criteria, and capacity of the new 
magistrates. Here, in this great hall, I want to tell the 
people -- and with God as my witness -- that I will devote all 
of my efforts so that the 1994 presidential elections will be 
remembered as the most honest elections of our history. I will 
turn over the presidential sash to whomever wins it honestly. 
This is the end of my 1990 statement. 
  Therefore, my commitment with this year's electoral campaign 
and my clear intentions of turning power over to whomever the 
people elect is nothing new. It is an ethical decision I made 
and a moral commitment I accepted from the Panamanian voters and 
myself, even before I won the 1989 elections. Ever since I 
assumed power, I have tried to create the proper atmosphere. I 
have made and supported all decisions that will facilitate this 
goal. I consider it an intrinsic duty with holding public power 
in an authentic democracy. I want my intentions and behavior to 
this effect to become a paradigm that is demanded from future 
presidents. I must reiterate my hopes that the elections will 
be conducted at a level worthy of all Panamanians and within the 
framework of decency and respect. 
  The majority of the deputies and alternates of this 
Legislative Assembly are hoping for reelection. They are 
thereby joining the thousands of Panamanians who are running for 
the hundreds of posts up for election in this campaign. As 
president of the Republic, who has had to preside over a 
difficult period of transition, I would like to see people 
elected who, during the next five years, will devote their best 
efforts to improving the country and continuing to build 
positive things. 
  I do not think there has ever been a president that has 
been targeted as much as I have been. My work has been 
questioned and severe charges have been levied against me, 
without any consideration whatsoever. All aspects of my 
administration have been harshly judged and this has been done 
in complete freedom. I have tolerated this because I have a 
historic mission to fulfill and because I respect the right of 
others in a democracy. The eradication of national problems has 
not been, is, or ever will be, something that can be achieved 
overnight. Only disinterested discipline, honest intentions, 
tenacity in the face of adversity, and clear and attainable 
goals can guarantee lasting and long-term success. 
  The Panamanian people deserve they be addressed honestly. No 
success is possible without effort or without sacrifice. The 
country's development and the wellbeing of the nation's poorest 
people can only be attained through everyone's hard and constant 
work and by way of essential values -- values such as honesty, 
loyalty, generosity, tolerance, and integrity. We must not 
forget that the political stability I have gone great lengths to 
maintain during these four years, despite all of the pressures 
exerted, is essential to creating the appropriate atmosphere for 
development, creating jobs, and reducing poverty. 
  God, guide all Panamanians to ensure that correct decisions 
are made during the upcoming elections and thereby lead us to 
the end of this epoch and guide us into the 21st century. All 
of us await better days for our fatherland and for our families. 
Hopefully, we will show good judgment in our decisions and 
actions to ensure that nothing clouds our hopes. 
  Today, more than ever before, our future depends on us. 
Unlike times gone by, we do not have a dictatorship that 
persecutes us in the street and in our homes. There is no 
regime like there was in the past -- one that uses blackmail or 
threatens the tranquility of our homes and families. There is 
no atmosphere of tension and fear that existed during the past 
elections campaign, which led to all kinds of unimaginable 
abuses the very same day that elections were being held. 
Moreover, we will not have a shameless vote count, such as 
occurred in May 1989, which led to the disgraceful annulment of 
the elections. 
  All we have is a broad path down which everyone's creative 
energy can be channeled toward a single constructive direction 
to make Panama a great nation. We are going to choose our 
destiny in full freedom; this will be our responsibility and no 
one else's. By way of well-channeled energies, we shall resolve 
both our large and small problems. 
  All goodwilled Panamanians, without distinction of race, 
position, or political belief, will face united the challenges 
and opportunities that lie ahead -- a future that is promising, 
splendid, and within our reach. 
  I am issuing this fervent call to all of my fellow citizens: 
We are a small country, but its size is also a fountain of 
opportunities and advantages. I feel optimistic. In my last 
message I invited you to lead our government of national 
reconstruction and transition toward democracy. Future 
presidents will find a country that is incomparably better and 
more orderly than the country we found. History will show this 
to be the case and will recognize it. Many thanks. [applause]

<F P=106> [Article by Ribamar Oliveira] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso offered his resignation twice during the ministers' 
meetings with President Itamar Franco at Planalto Palace over 
the weekend that included 12 hours of debate over the 
implementation of the URV [Real Value Unit]. Labor Minister 
Walter Barelli announced he was leaving the government once. The 
heated discussion calmed down only after Industry and Commerce 
Minister Elcio Alvares intervened and talked with Cardoso. 
  "Elcio put the fire out," a minister said. Cardoso's most 
explosive reaction was provoked by Barelli's proposal to give 
equal treatment to prices and salaries. This proposal would have 
caused the compulsory conversion of prices by the product's 
average price in the last four months -- January and February 
not counting because of the speculation in those months -- which 
would have resulted in a de facto price freeze. 
  "This is my limit and perhaps if I leave another person can 
amend the stabilization program," Cardoso said. There was a 
moment of surprise, particularly because shortly before Franco 
had made clear that he supported Barelli's proposal. The 
president supported the idea of controlling prices, particularly 
prices set in areas controlled by oligopolies. 
  The solution the ministers found was to call on Gustavo 
Franco, Central Bank external area director. Participants then 
started discussing a new draft to include Barelli's amendment 
without implying price controls, but making it clear that the 
government was determined not to permit excessive price 
increases. The MP [provisional measure] originally said that 
price conversions would be free with a generic citation saying 
the government would follow and supervise oligopolies. 
  According to the original text, when the time was ripe for 
converting the URV into the new currency, real prices would be 
adjusted "according to criteria established by the Finance 
Ministry." In order to resolve a disagreement over this text, it 
was decided to establish that prices would be adjusted by the 
average price in September, October, November, and December, 
eliminating January and February from the calculation. 
  It also was decided to follow up the behavior of price 
increases. So-called "abusive increases" will have to be 
explained by the entrepreneurs within a maximum five-day period. 
Prices higher than average will be considered "abusive." The 
draft satisfied Cardoso because it used the word "may." In 
other words, the conversion is voluntary, but the entrepreneurs 
will have to give an explanation if the average is not used. 
<H5>  Barelli </H5>
  Still on 26 February, Barelli inaugurated the succession of 
resignation proposals. He presented a timetable with three 
methods to improve the minimum wage. Barelli said: "I accept 
the amount established by the finance minister ($64.79), but I 
want the government to commit itself to improving the minimum 
wage." One proposal involved increasing the minimum wage to 
$100 by the end of this year. The other proposals involved 
improving the minimum wage by May or December 1995. 
  Cardoso and Social Security Minister Sergio Cutolo rejected 
these proposals. Barelli exclaimed: "The way the [economic] 
program is drawn up, the government does not need a labor 
minister." Cardoso rebuffed: "Then I am also leaving, because 
the country can have another finance minister." Alvares again 
calmed the spirits. When the meeting ended, the president 
proposed drawing up a note of solidarity with FHC2 [Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso -- second economic program] signed by all the 
ministers. 
  Barelli asked: "Does this solidarity include minimum wages?" 
Franco responded: "Yes." Barelli signed. The meeting's delay 
was caused by the president. As soon as the meeting began, he 
started reading the provisional measure. After reading each 
article, Franco asked each minister to voice an opinion, but the 
problems started with paragraph 1 of Article 3. The paragraph 
established that the BC [Central Bank] would determine the real 
currency's initial issuance date. Franco asked: "Isn't this an 
issue that must be decided by the president?" The expression 
Central Bank was replaced by executive branch. Similar changes 
were introduced in various MP passages.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Sixto Duran-Ballen; date and place not </F>
given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] Good evening, compatriots. When I accepted 
leadership of the country, I made a promise to you: to govern 
with a sense of nation, to govern without any political 
calculations. I promised to lead the country with the clearest 
vision of the future without thinking of immediate results 
[cojunturas] and easy achievements. 
  I have acted with determination to tackle and solve the main 
problems of Ecuador, of our Ecuador, to establish a modern 
structure that will allow us to achieve social, economic, and 
political development. In other words, to create a better 
Ecuador for our children. 
  Over the past years, the democracy that allowed a 
reencounter 
of all Ecuadoreans -- in which I have been a major player and 
defender -- has shown huge institutional and juridical voids, 
contradictions, and weaknesses that have undermined national 
unity and dramatically limited the state's ability to face 
changes, challenges, and the just demands of our society. 
  The entire nation has been the victim of the errors and 
distortions of a policy that seeks to benefit personal and party 
interests and fails to serve the Ecuadoran people. It suffices 
to remember the distressing and repeated episodes of power 
struggles and useless discussions that have impeded the 
strengthening of our country's democratic institutions. 
  I deserved your votes because it is clear that I am not 
moved 
by any ambition other than restructuring and reorienting our 
future. On the occasion of the analysis and debate of the issues 
that I am placing for your consideration this evening, opinions 
that are contrary to its goals and interests [conveniencias] 
will emerge. You must, however, know that we are seeking to 
recover for Ecuadoreans the ability and right to make decisions 
on very important issues for our future. 
  It will be said that the president of the Republic is 
seeking 
to hide behind the referendum to divert attention from the 
elections. The country knows me. I have served you many years 
and would not speak to you insincerely. The only thing that 
inspires and moves me is the need to construct a new society 
because it has been impossible for our institutions to solve 
these serious problems. 
  I cannot, in my capacity as chief of state, remain 
indifferent and aloof. Thus, I think that it is my unavoidable 
duty to resort to you, to the people's unappealable will, 
through this referendum, which will field very important issues 
that have already deserved ample nationwide debate. These 
issues I am submitting for your decision today. 
  It is indispensable that you, compatriots, as supreme bosses 
of democracy, indicate clearly to rulers and the ruled, to 
political parties, and to legislators the path that our country 
must follow to correct structural and legal voids that are 
drowning our progress. An authentic and honest referendum would 
force the government to avoid championing theories [tesis] or 
proposals. The Ecuadoran people must be sufficiently free to 
issue a clear and determinant opinion on aspects in which their 
political representatives have failed to achieve positive 
results. 
  In this consultation, the government, my government will 
neither influence nor lead [conducir] the opinions of 
Ecuadoreans. The state, through the appropriate organizations, 
must limit itself to informing about the content and scope of 
the proposal. The media must participate actively and 
responsibly in this task. The organizations and people who 
shape public opinion in our country, the political parties, the 
community organizations, the unions, and all Ecuadoreans who 
care about peace must also participate. 
  The 1 May elections constitute a valuable opportunity to 
propose this consultation to the country. 
  The system, which was developed by the Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal with significant human and economic effort for the 1 
May election, must be used so that all Ecuadoreans can speak out 
on the essential issues I will now submit for your 
consideration. The questions, my fellow Ecuadoreans, are the 
following: 
  1. Should voting be voluntary or mandatory? 
  2. Should the National Congress comprise one chamber; the 
Chamber of Deputies? Should it comprise two chambers; the 
Senate and the Chamber of Deputies? 
  3. Should the legislators serve for two years or four? 
  4. Should the election for legislators be carried out at 
the same time as the presidential election or at the same time 
as the run off election? 
  5. Should the president of the congress serve for one 
year or two? 
  6. Should legislators approve and administrate budget 
funds? Yes or no. 
  7. Should all elected officials be subject to reelection, 
including the president and deputies? Yes or no. 
  8. Should the Constitution recognize dual nationality for 
those Ecuadoreans who live abroad and have been forced to accept 
another nationality? You must answer yes or no. 
  My fellow citizens, let us focus on the greater national 
goals. Let us leave behind the small differences that separate 
us; the individual and local interests that prevent us from 
walking side by side. The essential issues I have just 
described clearly demonstrate my unbending will to govern the 
nation looking toward tomorrow's horizon and preparing for the 
future. My administration will not benefit from the reforms 
this general referendum will require. Future governments, 
however, will enjoy them. They will have better tools to work 
with and greater guarantees for their efforts. My fellow 
citizens, with God's help, let us decide our future together. 
Good night.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Uruguay monitored through 24 
February. 
  The public sector's financial deficit in 1993 was 
approximately $143 million, 1.1 percent of the gross domestic 
product. The surplus registered by the central government since 
1991 became a deficit in 1993 because of a drop in revenues and 
an increase in expenses in real terms, along with a decline in 
the surplus of public companies. (Montevideo BUSQUEDA in 
Spanish 17 February p 14) 
  Alberto Volonte Ferro, president of State Electric Power and 
Telephones, is in Washington, where he will sign a $200 million 
loan agreement with the Inter-American Development Bank and the 
World Bank. The fund will be used to finance modernization 
projects. (Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 18 Feb 94 p 9) 
  The Central Bank has reported that Uruguay's commercial 
exchange with Common Market of the South, Mercosur, members 
increased 21 percent in 1993. This commercial exchange 
represents 46 percent of total Uruguayan exports. Uruguayan 
trade with Mercosur registered a $426 million negative balance 
in 1993, 64 percent higher than in 1992. Trade with Argentina, 
Brazil, and Paraguay represented 40 percent of the total, with a 
$260 million deficit. Exports to Brazil, its main commercial 
partner, totalled $366 million, an increase of 30 percent 
compared with 1992. The trade deficit with Brazil was $269 
million, 26 percent more than in 1992. (Madrid EFE in Spanish

  [Text] Caracas, 1 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Today, President Rafael 
Caldera denied Venezuela supports the candidacy of Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo for OAS secretary general. 
According to sources at the government palace, Gaviria asked 
Caldera to support his candidacy, but the Venezuelan president 
said the country has its own candidate, whose qualities measure 
up to the needs of the hemisphere. 
  For several months, Venezuela has promoted the candidacy of 
Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas to this post. A 
Foreign Ministry spokesman affirmed Burelli will not only 
maintain his candidacy, but will also "fight for it until the 
second or third round" of votes at OAS headquarters in 
Washington. 
  The Venezuelan delegation to the OAS sent a statement to the 
evaluation committee noting Burelli Rivas as the "sole option to 
renewing the system." The communique added that with Venezuela, 
the inter-American system would have an OAS which is much more 
active and committed to the objectives and principles of its 
charter. 
  Political analysts feel the Venezuelan foreign minister 
would 
withdraw his candidacy to avoid a resounding defeat by Gaviria 
or Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, who seems to have 
received the support of Central America and the Caribbean.

  [Text] San Salvador, 28 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- An official source 
reported that the Central American Integration System (SICA) 
today hoisted its flag along with those of other regional 
countries at the border areas. A spokesman for the regional 
organization said these ceremonies were attended by high-ranking 
officials of each Central American foreign ministry. 
  The SICA flag-raising ceremony "reflects an integration 
process that is actually becoming a reality and also reflects a 
respect for rapprochement among people," the spokesman said. The 
"Central American flag," which is the symbol of regional 
integration, features the SICA emblem, which is a map of the 
isthmus and four spheres extolling the integral development 
being sought in the region. 
  SICA was created when the "Tegucigalpa Protocol" was signed 
in the Honduran capital in December 1991. It represents the 
region before the international community. This organization was 
officially established 1 February 1993 in San Salvador.

  [Text] Cuba has rejected the report by a special rapporteur 
on the human rights situation in Cuba, because it responds to 
U.S. pressures rather than to reality. During a news conference, 
Jose Perez Novoa, Cuban ambassador to the Commission on Human 
Rights, describes as unacceptable the discussion of a draft 
anti-Cuban resolution draft sponsored by the U.S. delegation, 
which will be voted on next week. Perez Novoa deplored the U.S. 
Administration's policy of hostility based on the fact that it 
cannot bring itself to accept Cuba's level of development of 
social, economic, and political programs despite that hostility. 
  Cuba has stated and reiterated over the years that it is 
ready to discuss its differences with the United States under 
conditions of sovereign equality and without preconditions. 
Perez Novoa added that the United States avoids and rejects 
normal relations and a discussion of differences.

  [Text] Jose Luis Rodriguez Garcia, minister president of 
the State Committee for Finance, has explained the country's 
complex economic situation and the efforts being made to bail 
the country out of the current crisis. 
  Speaking during a national training seminar for higher 
education teachers, Rodriguez Garcia said the country at this 
moment has more than 145,000 self-employed workers, and that 
this figure is increasing. He added that the measures adopted in 
the wake of dissolution of the socialist countries and the U.S. 
imperialist blockade have had an economic, political, and social 
cost. 
  During the seminar, postgraduate education was discussed, 
during which it was agreed that experts must be integrated to 
enhance their professional level and the prestige of the 
university center.

  [Text] Through Aviaco, the Spanish national airlines, Cuba 
has purchased eight planes, two of which are already in the 
country and soon to be put into service. 
  These are turbo-propelled, twin-engine planes with a 
functional capacity of between 44 and 48 passengers. The 
objective is to include them in the national and Caribbean 
routes. 
  The Cuban airline is responsible for tourism support and for 
Cuban national and international aviation, which are currently 
using Russian-made airplanes; that is, manufactured by the 
former Soviet Union. These planes are very safe, but they have 
been rendering service to the Cuban airlines for several years 
and we have been trying to find an alternative solution to these 
old Soviet-made planes so that national and international air 
transport will not be impaired by a gradual reduction of their 
service. 
  The Cuban airline intends to gradually replace these Russian 
airplanes by others which are more economic and more comfortable 
for passengers. These are Netherlands-made planes and their 
brand name is Fokker F-27-600. They are easily convertible from 
passenger to cargo planes. 
  Aviaco and Iberia cover all Spanish national routes.

  [Excerpts] Seventy-one kg of cocaine targeted for the U.S. 
market was seized during February by the Haitian antidrug 
service, including 31 kg on 28 February at the Port-au-Prince 
harbor. The drug seized on 28 February was concealed in boxes 
inside a container from Curacao. Businessman Jean St. Fort 
Pierre was arrested. Jean-Max Blanc filed a report: 
  [Begin Blanc recording in Creole] On 28 February in the 
Port-au-Prince harbor, the capital's antidrug brigade seized 31 
kg of cocaine, shipped from Curacao. Within two weeks, 43 kg of 
cocaine was seized by the antidrug brigade following the seizure 
of the 12 kg that a voodoo priestess was last week carrying to 
the United States. Since the beginning of the year, brigade 
authorities report they have seized 71 kg of cocaine and 
arrested 17 people involved in drug trafficking. 
  Major Casimir Louis states that the greatest problem the 
service now faces is the problem of justice. [passage omitted]. 
  About two weeks ago, the office broke up a drug network 
outside Port-au-Prince. At that time, the authorities seized two 
kg of cocaine, which is still in their office, and $100,000 U.S. 
In a statement by Maj. Louis Casimir on 1 March, the officer 
denied the accusation regarding the involvement of Haitian 
military in drug trafficking. He recognizes, however, that just 
as in all other institutions, the military could be involved in 
drugs, a military Casimir Louis calls dissident. [passage 
omitted] 
  According to authorities, 1 kg of cocaine costs between $20 
and $25 [as heard] on the U.S. market. The amount of the drug 
that the authorities seized on 1 March is evaluated at 
$2,800,000. [end recording]

  [Text] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada announced the 
Popular Participation Bill to the public yesterday evening over 
radio and television. This bill returns power to municipal 
governments. Financial resources will be reallocated following 
a new population distribution criterion. 
  The bill charges municipalities with the management of 
health 
care and education, while the central government will retain 
overall responsibility for these two areas. 
  The bill will be submitted to Congress in the next few hours 
and come into force one month after its promulgation. 
  Although it had been announced that a financial bill was to 
be submitted to Congress yesterday, Sanchez de Lozada reported 
that he will not do so until 24 February. 
  Some 50 people, including members of the press and citizens 
selected at random by a public opinion poll company, went to 
Government House to inquire about the subject. 
  Presenting the bill, Sanchez de Lozada stated that it is one 
of the most important steps since the 1952 revolution. 
  He said: "This is not a panacea for all our problems, but it 
is a significant step toward a true participatory democracy." 
  The government's initiative does away with old projects on 
administrative decentralization and seeks to favor regions 
proportional to their populations. 
  The bill intends to incorporate indigenous, peasant, and 
urban communities into the country's political and economic life 
by acknowledging their legal status. 
  It establishes grassroots organizations -- made up of 
directly elected provincial leaders -- to appoint 
representatives to the so-called "Overseeing Committees," which 
will supervise the work done by municipalities. 
  Their main responsibility will be to prevent more than 10 
percent of resources appropriated for municipalities being spent 
on current expenditures and to allocate the remaining 90 percent 
for public investments. 
  The popular participation bill has an important economic 
component. It is based on a new income distribution system. 
  It provides, for example, a modification to the 
revenue-sharing scheme: 20 percent of funds will be appropriated 
for municipal governments (up to now it was 10 percent) and 5 
percent for universities. The 10 percent that was allotted to 
development corporations has been eliminated. Municipalities 
will thus have real control of regional funds. 
  Once the new law is enacted, municipalities will have local 
governments to control a section of a province -- based on the 
German system of political organization. 
  The centerpiece of the president's proposal is the VAT 
[value-added tax] on hydrocarbons, which directly affects La Paz 
Department. 
  He announced that taxes -- especially the VAT on 
hydrocarbons 
-- will no longer benefit the locality in which the company is 
headquartered, but will be apportioned according to the new 
population criteria. 
  La Paz Department's share of the VAT collection on 
hydrocarbons is one of the most important resources to finance 
its development. 
  The president also announced the establishment of a 
$20-million compensatory fund for "poor" departments, which will 
be disbursed by the National Treasury. 
  With regard to education and health care, grassroots 
organizations will monitor officials' work, but it is clearly 
established that the government will not shirk its 
responsibility for providing this services. Therefore, while 
each grassroots organization will be in charge of the 
maintenance of hospitals, the central government will pay the 
salaries of teachers and physicians. 
  The president added that the country's smallest villages 
will 
have more resources at their disposal. He failed to say how big 
cities will fare as they will allegedly have to give up part of 
their resources to finance the development of poorer villages. 
  "The main focal point -- La Paz, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz 
de la Sierra -- will no longer monopolize everything," he said. 
  Despite all this explanation and because he failed to 
jointly 
present the financial bill, it is still not known how much money 
will be allocated to the regions for division between provinces 
and districts.

  [Text] Brasilia -- According to a recent poll conducted by 
Brasilia's Brazilian Institute of Political Studies (IBEP), the 
Constituent Congress is strongly in favor of making the state 
monopoly on petroleum more flexible. According to the poll, at 
least 63.7 percent of deputies and senators would vote for a 
constitutional amendment eliminating Petrobras' [Brazilian 
Petroleum Corporation] exclusive right to prospect for and 
exploit petroleum. The proposal, with majority support in 
Congress, provides for maintaining the union's monopoly, with 
the possibility of opening the sector to private enterprises 
through concessions. 
  This is the main result of an IBEP questionnaire that 104 
deputies and 25 senators, classified by party, ideology, and 
region, answered during the first week of February. Of the 64.7 
percent who favored the idea of the government granting 
petroleum concessions, 20.5 percent believe that the change is 
"necessary for promoting competition, to the benefit of 
consumers"; 16.5 percent maintain that this formula will 
preserve "national interests"; while 15.2 percent believe that 
it is "necessary for meeting the fuel demand." For 12.5 percent 
of those polled, the end of the monopoly is "inevitable" because 
of the lack of public funds for investment. 
  The polled sample, which covered 20 percent of the Chamber 
of 
Deputies and 30 percent of the Senate, reveled that some 
congressmen consider "insufficient" the proposal made by IBEP. 
Of those polled, 5.8 percent favor a radical change to move the 
public sector even farther away from controlling the economy. 
Only 25.5 percent of polled congressmen do not want the end of 
the state monopoly, arguing that it is "not necessary" (9.8 
percent); "harmful to national interests" (9.4 percent); and 
"harmful to Petrobras interests" (6.3 percent). Only 4 percent 
of those polled declined to give an opinion. 
  The Constituent Congress also supports the liberalization 
trend in the electric power, telecommunications, mining, and 
petrochemical sectors. According to IBEP data -- this 
enterprise has regularly evaluated congressmens' opinions since 
July -- a majority of deputies and senators want those sectors 
to be "jointly run" by the state and private eneterprises. In 
this poll, 55.9 percent of congressmen supported the "joint 
management" option -- details of which were, however, not given 
-- for the electric power sector and 47.2 percent for the 
telecommunications infrastructure field. 
  The same trend was observed in the mining sector: 49.6 
percent of those polled believe that "joint management" would be 
ideal, 40.2 percent believe that those areas should remain in 
private hands, while only 6.3 percent want them to remain in 
state hands. In the petrochemical field, 80.4 percent of those 
polled favored either the "joint management" or "private sector" 
options. Those polled also favored privatization of port 
services. 
  Other data from the poll strengthen the indication that the 
Constituent Congress does not have the nationalistic features of 
the National Constituent Assembly (1987-1988) which designed the 
current Constitution. The majority of deputies and senators 
(55.9 percent) believe that the different legal and taxation 
conditions applying to Brazilian enterprises with local capital 
and to Brazilian enterprises with foreign capital, which are 
provided for in the Constitution of 1988, are "undesirable." 
According to the so-called "liberal" congressmen, elimination 
of these restrictions can produce a regular inflow of foreign 
investment into the country.

<F P=106> [Article by Emanuel Neri] </F>
  [Text] Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho is 
willing to dispute the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party] presidential nomination with Orestes Quercia at the PMDB 
convention. He demands, however, that some conditions be met. 
Fleury wants those coordinating his candidacy to create a 
movement around him to enable him to face Quercia on an equal 
footing. He wants to avoid engaging in an electoral adventure 
and being used as an anti-Quercia instrument. 
  Last week in Brasilia, Fleury became convinced that he could 
seek the presidential nomination. In less than 24 hours -- 
between the evenings of 24 and 25 February -- he received the 
support of ranking members of his party. Yet Fleury refused to 
leave Brasilia as a candidate. Addressing a group of PMDB 
deputies who were prepared to launch his candidacy, Fleury said: 
"Hold it! Not yet." 
  A meeting with PMDB deputies on the evening of 24 February 
was the highlight of his visit to Brasilia. Of the 99 deputies 
in the PMDB bloc in Congress, 48 were there. The promoters of 
Fleury's candidacy believe as many as 70 members of the PMDB 
bloc in the Chamber of Deputies could support Fleury. They also 
believe between 25 and 27 PMDB senators support him. Fleury is 
scheduled to dine with these senators this week. 
  If he agrees to run, Fleury could surprise former Sao Paulo 
Governor Quercia. Fleury's aides began on 25 February to draft 
a map outlining support for Fleury state by state. This 
evaluation shows Fleury has the support of most PMDB members in 
10 states. It is expected that he has almost overwhelming 
support in major states such as Rio Grande do Sul and Minas 
Gerais. It is also expected that most delegates to the PMDB 
convention from Rio de Janeiro and Bahia States favor Fleury. 
  PMDB members from the states of Santa Catarina, Mato Grosso 
do Sul, Espirito Santo, Alagoas, Rio Grande do Norte, and 
Pernambuco are still expected to support Quercia. The remaining 
states are considered either pro-Quercia or undecided. Sao 
Paulo State, which is considered pro-Quercia, has the largest 
number of PMDB delegates. Of the 625 municipalities in the 
state, the PMDB has 362 mayors; most of them -- with rare 
exceptions -- are loyal to Quercia. 
  Quercia also controls the PMDB bloc at the Sao Paulo 
Legislative Assembly, where 20 of the 26 deputies are loyal to 
him. Fleury and Quercia are, however, even regarding the 14 
PMDB federal deputies; each has the support of seven deputies. 
The pro-Quercia faction appears to be strong in the states of 
Para, Mato Grosso, Paraiba, Goias, and Ceara. In Parana State, 
the PMDB answers to Governor Roberto Requiao, who also dreams 
about the presidential succession. 
  The promoters of Fleury's candidacy have emphasized other 
factors that favor their candidate. They contend that most of 
the strong PMDB gubernatorial candidates support Fleury. This 
is true of Antonio Britto (Rio Grande do Sul), Tarcisio Delgado 
(Minas Gerais), Divaldo Suruagy (Alagoas), Garibaldi Filho (Rio 
Grande do Norte), Wilson Campos (Mato Grosso), and Gerson Camata 
(Espirito Santo). The list also includes weaker candidates, 
such as former governor Moreira Franco (Rio de Janeiro) and the 
candidate to be nominated by the PMDB in Santa Catarina State. 
Moreira Franco, who admits that he would prefer Britto for the 
presidency, yesterday met with Quercia in Rio de Janeiro. He 
later said he will call Fleury tomorrow to ask if he plans to 
seek his presidential nomination. 
  Another factor favorable to Fleury is the support from all 
PMDB national leaders. Luiz Henrique, the PMDB president; Pedro 
Simon, the government leader in the Senate; Luiz Carlos Santos, 
the government leader in the Chamber of Deputies; and Tarcisio 
Delgado, the PMDB bloc leader in the Chamber of Deputies, are 
all opponents of Quercia. Simon has already announced his 
support for Fleury and Santos is the leading promoter of 
Fleury's candidacy. 
  Fleury is aware that the support he is receiving is prompted 
more by resistance to Quercia than by his own electoral appeal 
and has made it clear that he will not join an anti-Quercia 
front. He wants his candidacy to be an option to help the PMDB 
remain undivided over the presidential succession issue. He 
also voiced disagreement over the way some people have announced 
their support for him. 
  "Fleury's candidacy is more palatable than that of Quercia," 
Simon said. Fleury wants his support to be centered on 
political issues, without making any reference to Quercia. 
Loyal to Quercia, Para Governor Jader Barbalho distrusts the 
expressions of support for Fleury. He said: "It is a wedge 
being used by our adversaries to divide the PMDB in Sao Paulo," 
adding: "Behind the promotion of Fleury's candidacy by the Rio 
Grande do Sul leaders is the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party] candidacy." 
  His failure to draw the support of PMDB governors is another 
problem for Quercia. Except for Barbalho, none of the other six 
PMDB governors has voiced support for Quercia. Goias Governor 
Iris Rezende, who was a Quercia supporter, hopes to become a 
presidential candidate. Fleury's supporters are trying to 
persuade Rezende to run on Fleury's ticket. Amazonas Governor 
Gilberto Mestrinho has also remained silent. Paraiba Governor 
Ronaldo Cunha Lima has declined to state his position. Both 
Mestrinho and Cunha Lima were considered allies of Quercia. 
Tocantins Governor Moises Avelino has no leaning toward Quercia 
and Parana Governor Roberto Requiao is an avowed foe of Quercia. 
Fleury's supporters expect to obtain the support of the PMDB 
governors.

  [Text] [Rio de Janeiro] Governor Leonel Brizola (PDT) 
[Democratic Labor Party] is looking to the PMDB [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party] as the only party with which he might 
break the isolation of his candidacy for the presidency of the 
Republic. He is acting on two fronts, seeking to convince at 
least some PMDB members. He is openly courting the PMDB's Rio 
Grande do Sul State wing, while quietly and favorably responding 
to former [Sao Paulo] Governor Orestes Quercia's overtures for 
agreement. 
  Brizola's isolation stems from the unfeasibility of an 
alliance with the PT [Workers Party] -- owing to the absolute 
leadership of Lula [PT leader Luis Inacio Da Silva] in the polls 
and the consequent reluctance of the latter -- and with the PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party], mainly because of his 
aversion to the party's Ceara State wing. 
  In light of the affinity expressed by PPR [Progressive 
Renewal Party] leader Paulo Maluf, who is sympathetic toward 
Brizola, with [Bahia Governor] Antonio Carlos Magalhaes' PFL 
[Liberal Front Party] -- which is the PDT's worst enemy after 
entrepreneur Roberto Marinho -- it has been said that the 
possibility of an alliance has definitely been buried, leaving 
the PMDB as the only alternative. 
  Brizola has already met with PMDB President Luiz Henrique da 
Silveira once and will meet him again this week. Brizola 
proposes using his political clout in Rio Grande do Sul State to 
help former [Social Security] Minister Antonio Britto become the 
Rio Grande do Sul governor in exchange for support for his 
presidential candidacy. 
  Brizola even pledged to overcome old disagreements with 
Senator Pedro Simon in order to reach an understanding.

<F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: </F>
"Credibility Attained"] 
  [Text] For the first time in its 40 years of existence, 
NATO has shot real ammunition against enemy targets outside its 
field of action. There is little to commemorate in the first 
real military NATO action, the consequence of which was the 
destruction of four Serbian fighter planes, besides the 
unprecedented characteristic of the event, and the fact that the 
Serbs now know that the ultimatums issued by the NATO in the 
name of the United Nations are backed by the force of weapons 
and the will to use them. The incident served to demonstrate 
that NATO will not hesitate to use its operational superiority 
to maintain the exclusion zones established by the UN peace 
forces free from air strikes. In other words, the determination 
of one of the parties to comply with the public threats it has 
made is now known. What is not known is how far the other party 
will go in this confrontation of wills. 
  Since World War II the Yugoslav Armed Forces, made up mostly 
of Serbs, have prepared themselves for low-intensity war. This 
is what the Serbian militias have been doing in Bosnia, never 
engaging in a frontal battle against a superior enemy and never 
hurrying to close the siege. The policy followed by the Serbian 
leader in Bosnia, Radovan Karadzic, is in keeping with this 
military doctrine. Even Russia expressed support for the NATO 
action -- without, however, condemning its traditional Serbian 
allies. Karadzic went to Moscow to hold a meeting with Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. They agreed to open as of 7 
March the airport of the besieged Muslim city of Tuzla for 
humanitarian missions. Karadzic is playing the game well. He 
obeys the NATO ultimatum which had established that date to open 
the airport; has offered the Russians the chance to once again 
emerge as a decisive and essential player in any 
political-diplomatic arrangement in the Balkans; and at the same 
time he is telling his followers that it is yet not time to end 
the fight -- to the point that after the downing of the four 
Serbian airplanes Karadzic's militias bombed Tuzla, aiming at a 
hospital, a grocery store, an ammunition factory, and one of the 
landing strips of the airport. 
  The downing of four Serbian airplanes boosts the credibility 
of President Clinton's foreign policy, but does not represent a 
guarantee that there is a solution at hand for the Bosnian 
problem. After two years of hesitation, the Western world powers 
agreed on something in imposing restrictions on Serbian forces. 
These restrictions, however, are mild, and do not stop the 
massacre or the taking over of territory, and much less do they 
guarantee free traffic for the UN peace forces in Bosnia. There 
is not enough basic will to impose conditions for a minimally 
fair and lasting solution to guarantee peace in Europe.

  [Text] Brazil is giving up the passive diplomacy that has 
prevailed during the past few years in its relations with 
Europe. During his visit to Germany, Foreign Minister Celso 
Amorim has been trying to design a more dynamic position for 
Brazilian diplomacy and counter the self-restraint our country 
has been imposing on its foreign presence. High-level meetings 
have been scheduled for April when British Foreign Minister 
Douglas Hurd visits Brasilia, and the Brazilian foreign minister 
will visit France at the invitation of his counterpart, Alain 
Juppe. Amorim will address the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee then. 
  These bilateral meetings have not been held for some years. 
As just an example of the poor period being experienced by 
Brazilian diplomacy, the French foreign minister's visit to 
Brazil has been postponed four consecutive times during the past 
few years. 
  The positive results of the foreign minister's visit to 
Germany foreshadow a new period. In Bonn on 25 February, the 
Brazilian foreign minister himself announced these two important 
meetings with the British and French foreign ministers to O 
ESTADO DO SAO PAULO. Amorim said: "If Brazil hopes to play a 
leading role in the international arena, it cannot give up these 
talks." The Brazilian foreign minister accused former President 
Fernando Collor of destroying our country's foreign policy and 
not replacing it. 
  The Brazilian foreign minister admitted that recently our 
country has been placing less emphasis than it should on its 
bilateral relations. This explains the new effort toward 
France, the United Kingdom, and Germany, Brazil's three 
principal European partners, which represents a priority in 
Itamaraty's strategy. The effort to further approach these EC 
countries is obviously aimed at attracting technology and 
investments. Amorim emphasized: "To this end, however, it is 
necessary to hold political talks." 
  In the case of Germany, the Brazilian foreign minister 
explained: "The tripartite agreement's ratification was 
essential because diplomacy and development must work together." 
  Concerning specific projects, the minister confirmed the 
German interest in Sivam [Amazon Region Surveillance System]. 
The Germans are interested in installing the air traffic 
control system in the Amazon region. The French and Americans 
also have expressed interest in this project. The Brazilian 
Government's decision on the submitted proposals must be made by 
late April.

  [Text] Brasilia, 24 Feb (EFE) -- The president's office has 
reported that Brazilian President Itamar Franco today signed a 
contract to build a domestic branch of the projected gas 
pipeline that will carry Bolivian natural gas to Brazil. 
  The branch will be 360 km long, stretching between Rio de 
Janeiro and Belo Horizonte. The pipeline's construction and the 
supply of steel pipes will cost $44 million. 
  According to the state-owned petroleum enterprise Petrobras 
[Brazilian Petroleum Corporation], the gas pipeline, whose 
construction will take 14 months and will mobilize about 1,000 
technicians and workers, will allow during its initial phase the 
transport of 640,000 cubic meters of natural gas per day, and 
1.7 million cubic meters by the turn of this century. 
  According to the bilateral agreements, as of 1997 Bolivia 
will supply to Brazil about 8 million cubic meters of natural 
gas from Bolivian gas reserves. It is necessary, however, to 
build a 2,333 km pipeline to carry the gas from the Bolivian 
town of Rio Grande to the city of Campinas in Sao Paulo State. 
  Brazil will build a domestic network to distribute the gas 
in 
those states that are interested in purchasing it, such as Rio 
de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, and Rio Grande do Sul.

<F P=106> [Report by Elisa Betias Otero; from the "ACIR Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Excerpt] I would like to report that President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari indicated this afternoon that his 
administration is unflinchingly taking on the commitments agreed 
during the process for peace and justice taking place in 
Chiapas. He also announced that the necessary decisions to 
guarantee the execution of these commitments will be made in the 
next few days. 
  The president expressed his optimism with the conclusion of 
the peace and reconciliation talks in Chiapas and he indicated 
that the dialogue has already provided evidence of positive 
results. In this respect, he called for the support of society 
in order to reach to the signing of a peace agreement. 
  The president's statements were made public through a 
communique issued by the Presidency of the Republic. The 
communique stresses that the list of demands presented to the 
government through Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho was 
acknowledged with the true disposition of listening and solving 
the Indians' demands for justice, welfare, and dignity. 
  With regard to the letter the communique points out that the 
government has decided to seriously honor its commitments and 
that the necessary decisions to ensure the execution of said 
commitments will be made in the next few days. We expect 
society's support on the points agreed upon and that by backing 
these points we will all be looking out to ensure that all 
details are honored which will allow us to reach to the signing 
of a final peace agreement. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Victor Torres, Humberto Rios, and Juan de Dios </F>
Garcia] 
  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, 28 Feb -- 
Subcommander Marcos has warned there are "ghosts," such as the 
influence of cattle breeders, the white guards [not further 
identified], and the holding back of the electoral reforms, that 
threaten the peace process. While he has said the issues on 
national matters are still unbroached at the negotiating table, 
he has said the greatest problem concerns democracy. 
Furthermore, he did not rule out the talks could be extended to 
Thursday or Friday. 
  During a meeting in Catedral, he has said "we do not go so 
far as" to request the resignation of the president of the 
republic and his cabinet, but he did insist on the need "for 
electoral power to be turned over" to the people for assessment 
and supervision. 
  During a meeting with local reporters that lasted more than 
one and a half hours, the Zapatist subcommander has said there 
is nothing definite for the peace declaration, as there is still 
a long way to go. He has said there are no definite agreements, 
because upon whatever is agreed, the communities and the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] must reach a consensus, 
and they must be consulted at government levels by Manuel 
Camacho Solis, government peace commissioner. 
  The EZLN, he has said, has no guarantees, because, in 
addition to the fact that organization is not recognized, 
Camacho Solis "is unreal," given he has no legal status. "Our 
middleman does not exist," Marcos said upon insisting Camacho 
has no power of decision. The subcommander has anticipated an 
agreement is a long way off. 
  Marcos has said the Indian communities' autonomy is the 
issue 
that made the most progress at the negotiating table. There was 
even talk about holding a special period of congressional 
sessions to deal with the reform of the fourth constitutional 
article. Nevertheless, prior to this the reforms must obtain a 
consensus from the Indian communities. The idea is for the 
communities' form of government to be recognized legally, he has 
said. 
  He has said in Catedral the Zapatistas hardly have any 
contact with the peace commissioner, because communications are 
conducted via Bishop Samuel Ruiz. Marcos has said "we are quite 
fed up," because the proceedings are being translated into 
several dialects in order for the delegates to take them back to 
the communities. 
  The agreements, he has insisted, are only on paper. 
Nevertheless, he has recognized one can see a political 
willingness to find a solution to the problem. 
  Subcommander Marcos, who answered more than 20 questions, 
one 
per medium, has said the movement is starting to be recognized 
as authentically Indian, a point that "justifies life or death." 
He has said there must be changes. 
  Marcos has reiterated no consensus has been reached in the 
talks, because the power of decision on one side or the other is 
not definite. He has added this stage of the talks is 
threatened not by intolerance, rather, by the "ghosts" that loom 
over the process such as, for example, the incidents in Altamira 
and the events prior to possible electoral reforms. But even 
more serious are the regional ghosts that loom over pacification 
as a third force: the power of the cattle breeders and the white 
guards. To achieve peace this must be considered, because if 
the civil power cannot control that third force, there will be 
no peace. 
  The subcommander asked: "How can they [not further 
identified] ask the EZLN to disarm if one cannot disarm a white 
guard who wants to annihilate the Zapatists or other sectors 
they see as enemies. These include those who carry a camera, a 
pen, a notebook, and a badge that reads press, ONG 
[Nongovernment Organizations], National Commission on Human 
Rights, or whatever. If they consider them to be enemies they 
are going to....them. It is the most anachronistic mentality 
that abounds in these areas. Altamiro is just an example; the 
same goes for Ocosingo, Las Margaritas, Comitan, San Cristobal, 
and all the other places. Where landownership is concentrated 
the same will occur. What was previously known as the citizens 
defense committees or the unity of citizens defense are now the 
ghosts that will loom over the peace process and its 
fulfillment," he has said. Even though a peace agreement is 
reached, the ghosts will be there to hamper it, he has said. 
  Meanwhile, the Zapatist subcommander has dissociated the 
EZLN 
from the church, because he said the movement's purity and 
independence must be made clear. 
  Regarding the provision to engage in a dialogue with Camacho 
Solis without cover-ups, he has said the EZLN members will 
remove their ski caps and uncover their faces when they are 
recognized. They will continue to keep their faces covered, 
however, to protest the lack of recognition, he has said. 
  The peace agreements will be a fraud, will only be cosmetic 
if changes are not made nationwide. If there is resistance to 
change there will be warring operations throughout the nation. 
Then there will not be enough cathedrals to engage in 
negotiations nor enough jails to hold the Indians. 
  In conclusion, when he reiterated the points on national 
matters are still at a stalemate, Subcommander Marcos said the 
peace commissioner has set deadlines for a reply to the EZLN's 
list of demands that go up to 180 days for land matters. Marcos 
promised to deliver to the press the list of petitions and how 
Camacho Solis has responded.

<F P=106> ["Full text" of speech by Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential </F>
candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party, at a 
meeting with the Youths Parliament, Mexico XXI; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] Friends, dear parliamentarian youths: First, I wish 
to say I am very pleased to be with you today. It is very 
encouraging to meet with representatives of eight organizations 
which make up our party's Youths Parliament. It is very 
encouraging because it is irrefutable proof of how you have 
undertaken a new task; of how a new way to exchange opinions, 
arguments, and reasons has been established; and above all, it 
shows you are truly offering youths greater opportunities to 
participate in politics within our party. You represent 
imagination, the search for change, the energy and the ability 
to establish a more open relationship, a more dynamic and 
authentic relationship with Mexican society. Above all, however, 
I am very pleased to meet with you at a time when Mexican 
society is immersed in the most important political process. 
  We live in times of competitive democracy in which each 
political force, including ours, must present to society its 
programs, the actions it will carry out, its end-of-the-century 
vision of Mexico, its proposals, and above all, show each's 
political force capabilities to promote the transformation and 
change that Mexican society demands. 
  PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] youths, our option, 
our party's option, the option you represent -- let there be no 
doubt about this -- is to promote a profound transformation of 
our Mexico. In this regard, we must place our party at the front 
of this process by ensuring it fully assumes a rigorous agenda 
that will lead us to present new political practices to society 
and to overcome old vices. 
  We are a party that has the ability of making good use of 
the 
efforts we Mexicans have carried out so far. Looking beyond the 
accomplishments and mistakes, we cannot ignore the efforts 
Mexican have made in recent years. We cannot, we must not, 
remain trapped within the boundaries of proposals made six years 
ago, when the country was facing other kinds of problems. 
  We are and we must see ourselves as the party most capable 
of 
making good use of what has been accomplished, as the party with 
the strength to promote the changes and transformations that 
society is demanding. We have our mind set on making changes, 
but we do not plan to start from zero or to build everything 
anew. Countries are not born every six years. We do not want, we 
are not planning on remaining where we are now either. We will 
not succumb to inertia. With our plans for changes we offer new 
roads while making good use of what we have already accomplished. 
  In my trips throughout the country during these past 
campaign 
months, I have been able to establish that Mexico wants a 
significant change, but in a safe and responsible way. This is 
why security, responsibility, and changes are the three big 
components of our plan. We must act in a responsible way because 
our accomplishments, regardless of how modest they may be, have 
been made at the expense of big sacrifices; and we must make 
changes because without changes, progress cannot be made. 
  We represent security because we have experience, expertise, 
and we will make extensive decisions within the law and a de 
jure state. We are not promising magic. Our ideas are based on 
an objective and a real analysis of the progress that has been 
made and of what is necessary to change. 
  As the century draws to its end, Mexican society also 
demands 
responsible work. The next administration, the one that will 
head the efforts of the Mexican people at the conclusion of this 
century and this millennium, will have to be responsible and 
find ways to increase efficiency and fight incompetence and 
waste. It must be able to react in a timely fashion in the face 
of injustice; and it must be able to overcome bureaucratic 
paralysis, arrogance, and the temptation to look at everything 
from behind a desk. 
  A new phase of progress must begin with a new culture of 
responsibilities adopted by all but, most of all, the 
government. A government responsibility or a new culture of 
responsibility, like the one I am proposing, is something the 
next government definitely has to adopt to wipe out corruption 
where it is found, either in influence peddling or the 
paternalist [patrimonialista] view of power. 
  Security, responsibility and change, because I said one 
cannot talk of progress without them; while those who say 
everything is bad are lying, but those who defend the status quo 
are also mistaken. Mexico needs change with security and 
responsibility. Mexico demands a profound change at the 
grassroots level; a change that preserves what is valuable and 
at the same time allows us to make the progress society is 
demanding from us. And I intent to head those changes. We must 
respond to the change of mentalities with new actions -- you 
yourselves have said so through this tribune. Mexico has 
changed; it is different. It is an eminently young society; it 
is demanding. And it is to transformation to which we must 
respond, with new actions capable of overcoming gaps, extreme 
poverty, the existing imbalance among our regions, among 
Mexico's different regions, and the inability that often exists 
to guarantee compliance with the law. 
  We are, friends, young lawmakers, facing the need for a 
simultaneous change in politics and society. One cannot view 
with fear the change Mexico is demanding, nor can this change be 
accomplished through haggling, simulation, or fabrication. We 
will bring about a change in Mexico by implementing a firm 
policy with strict adherence to the law, with security and 
responsibility, so that our national unity is reinforced and our 
stability is guaranteed. That is the vision we have of the 
Mexico that is to come. 
  We have to go from good national economy indicators to a 
better income for each family, a better savings proficiency, a 
better quality of life, and most of all, a better future for our 
children. This is a change, that in politics, will do credit to 
the great strength of our plurality, and which will only be 
possible if we all become committed, in good faith, to 
consolidating our nation as a genuinely democratic nation. 
  With the end of old times, of little competition among 
parties, we also must relinquish the times of anticulture 
politics, of authoritarian domination. 
  These changes, within a social transformation, should cause 
us to forget the excuses that distance us from new opportunities 
in the poorest communities in the country, especially the Indian 
communities. We must forget the excuses, which, for centuries, 
compelled our Indian communities to maintain practically the 
same levels of welfare and immersed them in the same conditions 
of poverty and deprivation. We must fulfill our constitutional 
pledges to provide education, health, and housing for all 
Mexicans and to overcome inequality, deprivation, backwardness, 
and destitution. This is how we will reach a new degree of 
confidence; this is how we will achieve new changes with 
responsibility; this is how the PRI must rise to the challenge 
and prove it wants to win the people's trust on its own, and 
play an essential role in the future. 
  In this campaign I intend -- and I invite you to accompany 
me 
in this endeavor -- to draw on the support of citizens and 
Mexican society to make the changes that will allow us to build 
an economy that grants opportunities without losing the 
stability we have achieved. A political life that accepts 
elections as an instrument to solving competition between 
parties and increases opportunities for democratic 
participation. A social policy that efficiently fights poverty 
and great inequalities with efficiency. 
  Let there be no doubt, my young parliamentary friends, we, 
you and I currently represent the greatest opportunity to 
achieve changes in our country. And we fully intend to assume 
the responsibility we have, abiding by the rules, with security, 
responsibility, and unity in harmony. 
  I want to remind you young PRI members that events in 
Chiapas 
have shown us the urgent need for a political-democratic change. 
The urgent need for the economy to allow new and better 
opportunities for everyone, every citizen in every corner of our 
homeland. Events in Chiapas have shown us the urgent need to 
overcome generalizations so Mexicans can enjoy specific 
opportunities in each community where the Mexican citizen lives 
his daily life -- in the family, the community -- aware that he 
belongs to a great nation which requires unity and strength for 
the future. 
  We recognize the urgency of the events in Chiapas as an 
appeal to start a new phase. The PRI candidate and members are 
ready. That is my appeal to all of you, friends, young 
parliamentary members. The events in Chiapas serve as a warning. 
They emphasize that destitution, deprivations, accumulated 
insults, and frustrations can no longer be silenced with 
dilatory answers and new appeals for patience. We must not 
forget different problems prevail in our communities, our 
regions because our national geography is different, but it is 
all part of a single reality -- the reality which prevails in 
our country in 1994 as we approach the end of the century. This 
reality is characterized by insufficient family incomes; 
unemployment; but also that each and every one of us are willing 
to change. 
  In summary, my proposal is to find new options and new roads 
to freedom, justice, and democracy for all Mexicans thereby 
precluding violence, death among brothers, and confrontations. 
The PRI members in Mexico want, at this hour, to prove there is 
no valid reason to shed blood; that we must overcome our 
problems no matter how big they are; and that peace is the only 
thing which guarantees our welfare. 
  We must make sure no Mexicans needs to turn to weapons to be 
heard. We have the option of resolving any difference and that 
option is democracy; that option is the legal state, and that is 
the option we must choose. Thank you.

  [Text] San Jose, 28 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Luis Fishman, Costa 
Rican security minister, termed as "not serious and not precise" 
a UN report in which that nation's drug policy is questioned. 
The report was disclosed this weekend in Vienna, Austria. 
  The government official said that this very day he is 
sending 
a note requesting "to be told what is the basis of that report, 
when it was made, and who was interviewed." Fishman explained 
that the government had no knowledge that this study had been 
made. "No UN official consulted the police authorities in the 
country. The report is irresponsible and unimportant," the 
minister signaled. 
  The report, disclosed by the UN Inter-American Board on Drug 
Control which is headquartered in Vienna, on a study conducted 
in the middle of last year, highlights the "evident" lack of 
coordination among the police institutions as being among the 
problems Costa Rica suffers in this field. 
  Rafael Angel Guillen, director of the Judicial Investigation 
Agency, also denied the lack of coordination among police 
institutions. Meanwhile, Guillen highlighted the permanent 
struggle being waged to prevent his country from becoming a 
bridge for drug-trafficking activities from South America to the 
United States. 
  The UN report indicates that marijuana cultivation in 
isolated areas of Costa Rica has increased despite police 
efforts while it assures that Costa Rica is becoming 
increasingly a bridge for drug trafficking to the United States 
and Europe. "In the past two years (marijuana abuse) has 
doubled, while cocaine abuse has tripled," adds the report 
disclosed in Vienna. It also criticizes the "excessive" and 
incorrect use of lesser hypnotics and tranquilizers that 
constitute a real problem.

  [Text] According to all polls held in this country, the 
Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA] will win the 20 March 
elections. Rene Figueroa, of ARENA, has said that the voters' 
intentions to favor this organization are very clear and that 
this tendency is growing as elections day draws closer. 
  [Begin Figueroa recording] Looking at our own polls and at 
those carried out by the University of Central America [UCA] we 
find that it is clear that the electoral preferences for the 
presidential ticket made up of Armando Calderon Sol and Enrique 
Borgo Bustamante indicates that the ARENA candidates are sure 
first round winners. 
  The trend is clear, the backing of the Salvadoran people is 
clear, the intentions of the Salvadoran voters are clear. 
Another conclusion we have reached is that the Christian 
Democratic Party and the National Convergence-Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front [FMLN] coalition are competing for a 
distant, very distant, second place. We want to make this 
clear. Our polls and those of UCA indicate this. 
  We have reached the conclusion that as we approach election 
day, the support for ARENA grows while the support for the 
Christian Democratic Party and for the National Convergence-FMLN 
coalition remains unchanged. [end recording]

newscast; passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] [Gutierrez] While Miami is attempting to boycott 
Colombian products in retaliation for selling Colombian oil to 
Cuba, here, the government's decision is considered to be bad 
business, both economically and politically. Colombian oil sales 
to Cuba will start in July. We will sell them between 15,000 to 
20,000 barrels a day; something like a third of what the 
island's consumes. 
  [Mines and Energy Minister Guido Nule Amin] "What we are 
trying to do is establish commercial relations [with Cuba] 
similar to the ones we have established with other countries in 
the world." 
  [Gutierrez] People here, however, see several stains on the 
business, not caused by the black gold per se. Cuba does not 
have a sound payment capability and experienced oil people do 
not like the agreement very much. 
  [Former Mining Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo] "Colombia 
should not subsidize [Cuba] by selling oil cheaper than what can 
be obtained elsewhere. Second, the sale has to be carried out 
under strict banking and commercial conditions." 
  [Gutierrez] The Cubans have presented the possibility of 
refining our oil in their country as part of their payment. 
  [Former Mining Minister Guillermo Perry] "It depends on the 
efficiency of their refineries, how much they will pay for the 
crude oil, and the price we will get for products other than the 
gasoline we need." 
  [Gutierrez] For others who know this business, the oil 
refinery should be done here. 
  [Perry] "What Colombia needs is to have an export 
petrochemical refinery, and it should be established in the 
Morrosquillo gulf where the two oil pipelines merge." 
  [Gutierrez] In addition to the economic issues, the 
political 
ones also cast doubts on this business. Colombia is seen as 
giving oxygen to the Castro dictatorship and this jeopardizes 
its commercial relations with the United States.

arrested during a narcotics operation in Cali. 
  The alleged drug trafficker developed symptoms of angina, 
which prompted authorities to take him to a cardiology center. 
Orjuela was admitted to the Shaio Clinic on the evening of 17 
February with severe chest pains, nausea, and fatigue. 
Specialists performed a catheter exploration and found one 
artery was 90 percent obstructed. Orjuela also suffers from 
diabetes, which will affect his present cardiac condition. 
Doctors will perform surgery to remove the obstruction. 
Orjuela is now in his room in this clinic under permanent DIJIN

Julio Cesar Turbay, the Liberal Party director. Barely 12 days 
before congressional elections and with three kidnapped 
candidates and 500 municipalities in which political campaigns 
are banned because of domination by the guerrillas, the 
conservatives spoke out. The statement indicates that the 
government has been incapable of providing guarantees for the 
exercise of political rights. Here is what Conservative Party 
Deputy Cornelio Reyes said: 
  [Begin Reyes recording] The Colombian Government does not 
have the capacity to provide guarantees in over 500 
municipalities. [end recording] 
  The government, through Government Minister Fabio Villegas, 
assures that everything is normal and that elections will be 
held. 
  [Being Villegas recording] All Colombians, through their 
vote, want to go to the polls on 13 March to reject violence and 
terrorism as a political [word indistinct]. [end recording] 
  With the Liberal Party convention around the corner choosing 
a candidate, the Conservative Party Directorate has asked its 
party members to abstain from participating after labeling as 
outlandish former President Turbay's insinuation of alleged 
interference.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombia's economic developments monitored through 1 
March 1994. 
  Revenues from income taxes, the VAT [Value-Added Tax], and 
foreign trade increased by 44 percent in 1993 following the 
implementation of the tax reform law passed in 1992. The 
Treasury collected 400 billion pesos during the first half of 
February and expects to collect 200 million pesos in the third 
week. The treasury placed a sizable portion of the collected 
funds in securities to prevent instability in the financial 
system. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 16 Feb 94) 
  Colombia and Romania have signed a commercial cooperation 
agreement whereby beginning in September Romanian campers will 
be assembled in Colombia. During a recent visit to Colombia, 
Romanian Trade Minister Cristian Ionescu told his Colombian 
counterpart that his government would like to import Colombian 
coal for energy production and coke [coal residue], coffee, and 
bananas in exchange for Romanian-made mining equipment. Ionescu 
also proposed his country as a distributor of Colombian coffee 
and expressed interest in an aerial route between Romania and 
South America. (Paris AFP in Spanish 1811 GMT 22 Feb 94)

  [Text] Human Rights Ombudsman Dr. Jorge Mario Garcia 
Laguardia requested the Army's and the Foreign Ministry's 
intervention to protect the nation's territorial integrity and 
the lives of Guatemalans settled along the Belizean border. 
During his visit to the region, the ombudsman personally 
learned about the threats that Belizean soldiers issued against 
35 families who live at the border town of Rio Blanco, Dolores, 
Peten Department. The high-ranking official met with peasants 
of the aforementioned town and the mayor of Dolores who gave a 
detailed account of the threats issued by the Belizean military. 
  Sebastian Tux, a peasant, asked the ombudsman to clearly 
demarcate the boundary with Belize, because last year Belizean 
soldiers also forced them to abandon their land, where they left 
behind a crop of approximately 2,500 quintals of beans and 2,000 
quintals of corn. He added: If necessary we, the peasants, 
offer our labor to build a boundary along the border. We have 
looked for another place to relocate, but have not found one. 
He said they would rather stay than emigrate from the lands 
they have tilled for many years. 
  Moreover, Ombudsman Garcia Laguardia said it all began when 
former President Jorge Serrano accepted Belize's independence 
and established diplomatic relations with its government, an 
unconstitutional act that would have never been accepted by the 
Guatemalans if a referendum had been held on the issue. 
  However, he added, two key institutions have to intervene: 
the Army and the Foreign Ministry. Besides, the Armed Forces 
are duty bound to maintain strict control of the border, which 
it has apparently neglected; and the Foreign Ministry has to 
mediate with the Belizean Government through diplomatic channels 
to prevent these actions. Referring to this, he asked the Army 
to permanently protect the border zone and guarantee Guatemalan 
rights; and he asked the Foreign Ministry to mediate 
diplomatically to put an end to hostilities and provide 
guarantees to the Guatemalan citizens, so they may live in their 
country and exercise their rights.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 1 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- The Guatemalan 
Government today downplayed the request by the Attorney 
General's Office for the declaration of a state of emergency in 
view of the rumors of an alleged conspiracy to topple the 
government. 
  Hector Luna Troccoli, secretary general of the presidency, 
told the media that the request made by Attorney General 
Telesforo Guerra was "on a personal basis, and as any other 
citizen, he has the right to give his opinion." 
  Luna explained that this extreme measure -- which is part of 
the Public Order Law -- can only be issued personally by the 
president, Ramiro de Leon, or with the consensus of the cabinet 
when the situation merits it. 
  According to the official, that is not the situation in 
Guatemala at this time. Luna Troccoli admitted that these 
"comments have been made in informal talks," but he reiterated 
that De Leon "has not given any consideration to declaring a 
state of emergency because the circumstances do not really call 
for it." 
  The Attorney General's Office charged there is a plan to 
destabilize the government of Ramiro de Leon in which 
politicians, judges, and union leaders are reportedly involved, 
but he abstained from giving their names. Nonetheless, the 
political parties and the union leaders have demanded that 
Guerra present evidence of the alleged plot, which the attorney 
general linked to a strike movement of the public workers who 
are demanding salary increases.

  [Text] On 1 March at a news conference, Foreign Minister 
Marithza Ruiz Vielman said Guatemala has decided to send a 
formal note to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali in order to 
protect Guatemala's rights regarding Belize. She explained that 
the note will contain relevant considerations regarding 
territorial waters, the economic exclusive zone, and the 
continental shelf, with the goal of being distributed as an 
official UN document. 
  Vielman said that reference is made in the note to 
Guatemala's unrestricted compliance to UN Charter principles 
and, consequently, to Guatemala's interest in resolving the 
dispute with Belize. Vielman noted that the solution would be 
attained through negotiation or international jurisdictional 
procedures when she announced that the letter will be sent soon 
and that it will be disclosed to the media as soon as it is. 
  Regarding Guatemalan families' complaints of threats and a 
Belizean military ultimatum to make them leave their lands, 
which are allegedly in Belizean territory, she said the presence 
of settlers has been confirmed "to the east of the historic 
monuments that are being used as a reference point with Belize." 
She pointed out that "in case they prove the settlement is 
located in the protected Mayan biosphere area and that it was 
established illegally, the settlers will have to leave the area, 
but the Guatemalan Government will see to it that their rights 
are respected and that they are able to take the products of 
their harvest and their personal goods." 
  Vielman also clarified that Guatemala's interest in seeking 
a 
solution causing the least possible damage to the settlers 
should not be viewed as a renunciation of its rights in the 
territorial claim. She said that Guatemala and Belize have not 
recognized the mentioned monuments as a demarcation line, which 
was confirmed by the 31 July 1992 Joint Declaration. Vielman 
stated that "while the territorial dispute has not been resolved 
and with the sole purpose of avoiding a confrontation, the 
monuments have been used as a reference point by authorities 
from both countries." 
  Vielman added that if the settlers must be removed, no 
deadline will be stipulated because, with the protection of 
Guatemalan authorities, they will determine the time they need 
to prevent losing their crops. She refused to accept that this 
is a threat by the Belizean Government, and instead called the 
Belizean statement "a message to withdraw from there," in 
accordance with the Guatemalan ambassador in Belize. 
  The official argument for the removal of the settlers from 
the place is that it pertains to the Mayan biosphere, and this 
is why, when de Vielman was asked about the reasons why this 
policy is not followed with other people in similar conditions, 
she only replied that it concerns the organizations in charge. 
Finally, Vielman said the Belizean Commission will be in charge 
of drafting the mechanisms to be followed in the territorial 
claim case, and she could not venture to express her view in 
that regard.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 2 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Students from 
the medical school at the San Carlos de Guatemala University 
have released the 125 professors who were detained for more than 
eight hours. The students have demanded the professors resume 
classes and suspend the 15-day-old strike. 
  Carlos Mazariegos, faculty secretary, has told ACAN-EFE the 
200 students have agreed to call off the measure after the 
professors concurred to hold an assembly to analyze the 
situation. 
  The Medical Students Association detained the professors 
last 
night, local time, while they were holding an assembly at the 
university. The professors have not taught classes for 15 days 
in support of the doctors who are on strike nationwide in demand 
of a salary increase. 
  This labor conflict coincides with the framework of the 
partial work stoppages and strikes staged by thousands of 
government workers as of four weeks ago in demand of an up to 
40-percent salary increase. 
  The students had announced they would release the professors 
once they made a commitment to resume teaching, in exchange for 
student support in their public demonstrations for a better 
salary. 
  Mazariegos has said both groups would participate in an 
assembly called for by Faculty Dean Jafeth Cabrera during which 
the resumption of classes next week will be analyzed.

<F P=106> [Article by Adolfo Olivas Olivas] </F>
  [Text] Esteli -- Melvin Ernesto Herrera Agurcia, the 
captured former first lieutenant of the Sandinist People's Army 
[EPS] and military leader of the self-styled Cobra 93 Nicaraguan 
Guerrilla Front [Frente Guerrillero Nicaraguense Cobra 93], has 
said this movement, which authorities call a "criminal gang," 
has received the military support of six National Police members 
and certain EPS followers. 
  The National Police arrested this week Herrera Agurcia, a 
retired Army officer, when he was hiding in the home of 
Subcommander Tobias Gadea, a retired Government Ministry 
official and an Esteli City resident. 
  The leader of Cobra 93, which operates with the support of 
cooperatives in the Miraflor area, said at the time he was 
arrested he was making contacts related to his guerrilla 
activities. Although Herrera did say: "I have been staying in 
his house for a long time," he denied Tobias Gadea's involvement 
in this new recompas movement. 
  Herrera said many retired officers support Cobras 93, but 
when there are criminal activities involved, sympathizers begin 
to suspect the rearmed members. 
  Herrera Agurcia, a Quilali native, led the Battalions for 
Unconventional Warfare during the past decade, and after joining 
the retirement plan for a large number of officers he left for 
San Bartolo to farm his father's lands. According to Herrera 
Agurcia, the 3-80 Northern Front [FN 3-80] recontras killed his 
brother and other relatives and raped and beat his wife, leading 
her to have an abortion. 
  This is how he arrived in Esteli, where he organized the 
self-styled Cobra 93 so as to "make the recontras pay for the 
death of our relatives." 
  Herrera Agurcia explained the movement's objectives were 
betrayed by Ramon Alejandro Bermudez, a retired officer and 
Cobra 93 second in command, because his men began to rape 
peasant women and to become involved in kidnappings and attacks 
against communities along the Pan-American Highway from Esteli 
to Condega. 
  During a news conference at the National Police Command 
Operations Center in Esteli that took place on 25 February, 
Herrera Agurcia said before the main police commands of the 
department Bermudez had told him before his arrest six policemen 
and EPS members on duty were supporting the movement, and they 
were even donating war weapons. 
  Subcommander Douglas Zeledon, second department police 
chief, 
confirmed Policeman Leonel Valenzuela was arrested as a presumed 
"Cobra 93" collaborator. 
  He added investigations are still going on to detect the 
possibility of individuals being involved in planning the 
recompas actions. So far the recompas have perpetrated nine 
robberies and other crimes. 
  Zeledon said the operations will continue until 
approximately 
16 criminals are arrested, although Herrera Agurcia said his 
forces include up to 80 men, and if the government does not give 
them an enclave, they will begin actions against the FN 3-80 in 
El Zungano. 
  The military operations have resulted in the arrest of 12 
people, including two injured, most of whom are retired EPS 
members and members of cooperatives in Miraflor, 27 km 
northeast of Esteli. 
  The authorities have also seized 10 AK and M-16 rifles, one 
23-25 carbine, TNT explosives, a large amount of ammunition, 
backpacks, uniforms, medicine, and other military material. 
  Subcommander Zeledon explained three criminal bands operate 
in Esteli Department, including the remnants of Cobra 93, 
robbers who operate in Pueblo Nuevo and affiliate with the FROC 
[Peasant-Worker Revolutionary Front], and another group that 
operates between Yali and Condega.

  [Editorial Report] Managua EL NUEVO DIARIO in Spanish of 14 
February 1994 on page 7 reports that Sandinist deputy Sergio 
Ramirez remarked to the head of the German Press Agency for 
Mexico and Central America that the Sandinist National 
Liberation Front (FSLN) "needs to bury its political-military 
past and strive to be a modern party...capable of confronting 
the problems of the great majority." He said that FSLN leaders 
must communicate more with the voters and bear in mind that they 
represent a party "which rejects all methods of violence...." 
Turning to the current crisis, Ramirez said that the 
government's greatest weakness in its economic policy is 
"ignoring the massive problems of the population" and 
"overemphasizing the dictates of the international financial 
organizations." Stating that he is against neoliberal policies, 
Ramirez also said that he has no intention of seeking the 
position of FSLN secretary general. In response to a question 
about the social-democratic nature of the FSLN, Ramirez 
explained that while the FSLN is a member of the Socialist 
International, there is a current within the Front which 
represents "the democratic left."

(FAS) pilots are leaving the Air Force because of opportunities 
to receive higher salaries working as helicopter and airplane 
pilots in Costa Rica and other Central American countries. 
According to the article, the number of requests to leave the 
FAS has been so great that some pilots have been incarcerated in 
order to prevent desertions. The Sandinist People's Army (EPS) 
has requested the assistance of the National Police in arresting 
deserting pilots, the article reports. Because so many pilots 
are leaving, the FAS is unable to provide enough crews for all 
of its aircraft. Captain Eduardo Medina of the EPS Office of 
Public Relations confirmed that the police had arrested FAS 
pilots but denied any knowledge of why they were detained.

<F P=106> [Report on "exclusive" interview with National Consensus </F>
Alliance presidential candidate Samuel Lewis Galindo by Carmen 
Elida Contreras; place and date not given] 
  [Text] "We cannot administer a canal if the isthmus is 
surrounded by scarcity, violence, abject poverty, and tragedy," 
warned presidential candidate Samuel Lewis Galindo, who 
represents the Solidarity and National Unity Mission (MUN) 
parties. Despite the fact that recent polls have not favored 
Lewis Galindo, he believes in them and is aware that his 
campaign work has to be more intense. Lewis Galindo, who is 66, 
is accompanied by candidates David Guerra, MUN, and Marisin 
Villalaz de Arias, Solidarity. 
  In an exclusive interview with LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA, the 
politician speaks of the country's main problems and how he will 
fight them as part of a government plan. 
<H5>  Why an Alliance With Mission? </H5>
  Despite the fact that Solidarity initially talked to all 
political parties seeking options to create a coalition, 
Solidarity members decided to join MUN. 
  "In Mission we found points of agreement with our government 
plans, in the need to make a great national concerted agreement 
to frontally attack unemployment, crime, and raise our 
population's morality level," Lewis Galindo, who is also an 
entrepreneur, said. 
  He said that it was not an alliance based on "electoral 
campaign conveniences," instead, a serious pact that seeks only 
the good of the country, intentions that are outlined in the 
Action Plan document. 
<H5>  National Emergency Unemployment Plan </H5>
  Lewis Galindo is of the opinion that the country's main 
problems, which his administration will give priority to, are 
unemployment, crime, drug addiction, and economic development -- 
a topic linked to each of the others. 
  "Unemployment is not a problem that will be resolved in days 
or months, but it can be reduced." He mentioned the need to 
create a national emergency plan to employ at least 40,000 
Panamanians in community work in poor neighborhoods, which 
translates to paying out $70 million a year. This would be 
covered not by increasing taxes, but by improving their 
collection by 15 percent. 
  Tourism is a source of jobs that can be taken advantage of 
by 
raising the Panama Tourism Institute to the rank of ministry and 
structuring a coherent development plan that will offer 
permanent jobs to more than 30,000 persons and attract the 
attention of visitors. 
  The road network could be improved to lessen the 
transportation crisis, mainly in the metropolitan area. 
<H5>  Complete Modernization of the State </H5>
  According to Lewis, the Panamanian state is currently ruled 
by the same plan that dates back 20-30 years, thus state 
bureaucracy needs the inducement of a civil service career that 
offers the same benefits and security that private enterprise 
workers receive. 
  "We must immediately give the Social Security Fund [CSS] 
administrative and economic independence," the candidate noted 
and suggested a total revision of the CSS situation to improve 
its services, which are now deficient. 
  One must also study the possibility of basing retirement on 
the activity each individual conducts, he said and added, "life 
expectancy is not the same for all occupations. He recommended 
paying greater attention to pensioners, who "often feel 
neglected and are unable to obtain the income they need to 
subsist, and here is where social security must act so that they 
live their last years with dignity." 
  "We must seek the way so that the soldiers who studied a 
career for which there is no room in Panama can adapt to a new 
life," and to achieve it they must be granted study and work 
opportunities. 
  He noted the National Police must receive the advisory 
services of experts who at some time reorganized the police 
corps in other countries that have social problems identical to 
ours. 
  Lewis Galindo criticized the performance of Ruben Dario 
Carles at the helm of the state finances for "not adequately 
handling" the foreign debt, a situation that led to an increase 
of the commercial debt that currently totals $1.2 billion with 
interest. 
  He has left the country more indebted than before "because 
he 
followed the easy path of yielding to U.S. pressure" and did not 
have an adequate economic plan. Lewis Galindo made these 
remarks after Comptroller General Jose Chen Barria warned about 
a fiscal deficit. In Lewis Galindo's opinion, the mistake was 
to cancel the debt with the international financial institutions 
and miss the opportunity of negotiating the commercial debt, 
which at one point was worth 13 cents and is now almost 17 cents. 
  Lewis Galindo is a businessman and has been the chief 
executive officer of several industries, such as Cerveceria 
Chiricana [Chiriqui Brewery], Cerveceria Nacional [National 
Brewery], Construcciones Nacionales [National Construction 
Company], and the president of Banco del Istmo [Isthmus Bank], 
as well as ambassador to the UN General Assembly.

<F P=106> [Report by Celiano Fonseca including live telephone </F>
interview with Roberto Leyton, former Panamanian ambassador to 
the OAS, by RPC Television News Director Julio Miller; from "The 
RPC Television News" newscast] 
  [Text] [Fonseca] Panamanian attorney Ricardo Leyton and 28 
other Panamanian and U.S. citizens have been arrested in Tampa, 
Florida, on charges of conspiring to launder money. News 
Director Julio Miller is on the telephone with Roberto Leyton, 
former Panamanian ambassador to the OAS. 
  [Miller] Mr. Leyton, is this information from the United 
States true? 
  [Leyton] I can only tell you what I know, which is what my 
brother's lawyers told me when I talked to them at noon. They 
told me that the charge is indeed conspiracy to launder money, 
and that my brother has reiterated his absolute innocence. They 
have said that there is no specific accusation against my 
brother. They themselves concede that they have never seen 
anything similar to this because my brother has not been accused 
of conducting any transactions with cash money, which is what is 
regularly referred to as money laundering -- an attempt to 
convert money obtained illegally into cash. 
  According to what my brother has told them, he has strictly 
abided by Panamanian laws; all money transfers were conducted 
with the proper authorization of the people he was representing; 
and those transfers never involved cash money, but were bank 
transactions of money that had already been deposited in 
renowned banks. According to him, he has done nothing different 
from what corporate lawyers do in Panama. 
  [Miller] Mr. Leyton, what about the involvement of companies 
such as Merryl-Lynch and the existence of 45 kg of cocaine that 
were going to be introduced in the United States? 
  [Leyton] I repeat again: I have no information regarding any 
drug accusations against my brother, only about the charge of 
conspiring to launder money. From a newscast I watched before, 
I think Merrill-Lynch is involved, but I have no proof of this. 
My sole concern is my brother. 
  [Miller] When will a decision be made? 
  [Leyton] I have no information on that. All I know is there 
will be a hearing on 4 March to determine bail. The lawyers 
have already told me that it is difficult for foreigners to 
obtain bail because they have no collateral. My brother does 
not have enough resources to make a deposit as large as the one 
they usually request, however, there will be a hearing to 
discuss this matter. 
  I want to use this opportunity to denounce the slander and 
evil intentions of people who have tried to involve me in this 
matter. I have nothing to do with this situation, I do not even 
work with my brother. We have not even had a single client in 
common. Ricardo is my brother, I believe he is innocent, and I 
will support him as his brother, but we run our offices 
independently. I do not know for sure if there is political 
motivations behind this, but I want to explain that my brother 
and I do not even belong to the same political party or follow 
the same political trends. Do you have any more questions? 
  [Miller] Thanks, Mr. Leyton. We are very grateful for your 
statement. 
  [Fonseca] During his first statement in Tampa, Ricardo 
Leyton 
has maintained his innocence. With regard to this case, 28 
persons have been arrested. Thus far, reports have mentioned 
that Luis Sanchez, a businessman, and Ricardo McFadden, an 
auditor, were arrested with Leyton in Tampa. RPC Television 
learned that on 4 March, the Tampa Court will decide whether or 
not Leyton and the other 28 suspects will be freed on bail. RPC 
reports indicate that several covert DEA agents infiltrated the 
group of presumed investors, and that they were the ones to leak 
the information and provide the details to issue an arrest 
warrant against Leyton and the others who are accused.

  [Text] Quito, 2 Mar (EFE) -- Approximately 400 activists of 
the leftist Democratic People's Movement (MPD) today occupied 
the headquarters of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) in 
defense of a candidacy for the 1 May legislative and municipal 
elections. The peaceful occupation, in which dozens of workers 
and peasants are participating, was undertaken after it was 
rumored that the candidacy of Antonio Ponce, MPD candidate for 
deputy from the northern Andean Province of Imbabura, was going 
to be disqualified. 
  MPD leader John Pule accused the TSE members, who belong to 
populist, Social Democratic, and rightist parties, of trying to 
disqualify that candidacy. Nevertheless, he did not explain the 
reason for that fear. 
  Acting TSE President Medardo Oleas and some TSE members are 
meeting with the leaders of the building's occupiers, which is 
located in a residential area in northern Quito, to try to solve 
the problem. 
  The TSE is finalizing the details of the legislative, 
municipal, and provincial elections that will be held in three 
months. These will include a plebiscite on several 
constitutional reforms announced yesterday by Ecuadoran 
President Sixto Duran-Ballen.

of the production in order to promote an increase in prices in 
the international market. Nicolas Fuentes, marketing manager of 
the National Cocoa Program, said that Ecuador receives 
preferential treatment for the marketing of fine cocoa.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Peruvian economic developments monitored through 28 
February. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  The State Petroleum Agency, Petroperu, reported a 
6.7-percent 
increase in oil production in January when it reached an average 
daily yield of 132,916 barrels. Prospects for 1994 will be 
approximately 130,000 barrels a day. The average for 1993 was 
125,000 barrels a day, which represents a 9-percent increase 
over 1992. Energy and Mines Minister Daniel Hokama stated that 
proven oil reserves will increase 10 percent in 1994 and will 
reach 420 billion barrels. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1941 
GMT 23 Feb 94) 
  The Public Enterprises for Fishing Certificates, Cerper, was 
privatized in only seven minutes. Drocasa made the purchase for 
$1.601 million, $1,000 over the requested minimum. Drocasa was 
the sole bidder. In another report, Juan De la Piedra, legal 
representative in our country for Business Software Alliance, 
said that Peru could be subject to sanctions for allowing 
computer programing software piracy. He added that Peru should 
respect Decision No. 351, which regulates copyright and authors' 
rights in the Cartagena Agreement, otherwise Peru could be fined 
by the United States. (Lima Global de Television Network in

  [Text] On 1 March, representatives of the so-called 
National Front for the Defense of Banco Latino and Banco 
Hipotecario de Occidente Depositors [Frente Nacional Pro-defensa 
de los Depositantes del Banco Latino y del Banco Hipotecario de 
Occidente] occupied the Dutch Consulate in this city [Maracaibo, 
Zulia State capital]. 
  Elias Mata and Aurelio Mhr said that this measure seeks to 
expose to international public opinion the financial problems 
depositors have had to face since the intervention of Banco 
Latino. In this particular case, they want the Dutch consul to 
ask the Dutch ambassador to Venezuela and Venezuelan Foreign 
Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas to suggest to the Dutch and 
Venezuelan Governments that they establish a commission to 
investigate the Latino NV Curazao case. 
  They also urged the Dutch and Venezuelan Governments "to see 
that the culprits in the Latino NV Curazao case are punished." 
We are also demanding that the Dutch Government guarantee 
deposits that are currently frozen in Latino NV, Curazao. This 
action also demands the expeditious treatment of an emergency 
law submitted for Congress' consideration, they added. Front 
members asked the national government to allow "representatives 
of those affected by the Banco Latino and its branches crisis to 
participate in the commissions discussing the emergency law." 
  This afternoon, Dutch Consul George Vinck reportedly gave 
the 
protesters a document written in English, which reportedly 
states his government's position on this situation.

  [Text] Caracas, 2 Mar (EFE) -- Defense Minister Rafael 
Angel Montero Revette announced today the Venezuelan Government 
and Armed Forces have dismissed the possibility of another coup 
attempt. 
  "We, the Armed Forces and government, do not fear a coup 
d'etat," Montero Revette said in reference to the internal 
situation of the Armed Forces, although he admitted as long as 
soldiers are imprisoned there will be problems. 
  Montero said the intention of President Rafael Caldera's 
government is to resolve "as soon as possible" the problem of 
the soldiers prosecuted for the 4 February and 27 November 1992 
coup attempts. 
  He said 17 soldiers [oficiales], 21 lieutenant colonels, 
three majors, nine captains and three lieutenants are still 
under arrest for the 4 February coup attempt. Added to these 
are two rear admirals, one colonel, five lieutenant colonels, 
one frigate captain, four majors, three captains, nine 
lieutenants, two noncommissioned officers and one civilian who 
were charged in the 27 November coup attempt. 
  In addition to these, a group of soldiers led by General 
Francisco Visconti are in Peru, where they received political 
asylum for their part in the 27 November coup attempt. Two 
soldiers are also in exile in Ecuador for the same reason. 
  Montero said the legal cases of all the soldiers implicated 
in the coup attempts are being studied to determine how they can 
be acquitted. 
  Nevertheless, he said, a return to military service will be 
very difficult for the detainees who have made political 
statements or participated in any way in the country's politics. 
  Montero disclosed, meanwhile, the Defense Ministry had 
financed a trip to the United States by former Defense Minister 
Vice Admiral Radames Munoz Leon as a guest of an American 
university. 
  According to unofficial reports, Munoz Leon traveled to the 
United States to seek Pentagon support for a coup d'etat that 
would hinder Rafael Caldera's victory in the elections. 
  The defense minister said he could not guarantee that Munoz 
Leon did not have conspiratorial intentions.

  [Text] While addressing the UN human rights commission, 
Haitian President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide called on the 
international community to abandon its neutrality and obtain the 
immediate departure of the chiefs of the Haitian Army and 
Police. Stalling maneuvers and deceptive promises can only ruin 
the credibility of those involved in this crisis, stated the 
president-in-exile, who asserted that the international 
community cannot be neutral and that it is necessary for the 
Army and Police hierarchy to step down without delay -- 
immediately and at once, he said. 
  Father Aristide did not refer directly to the latest 
discussions held in the UN Security Council to try to impose 
implementation of the Governors Island agreement through 
sanctions against the military regime in Haiti. According to 
Jean-Bernard Merimee of France, current Security Council 
president, a draft resolution in this connection should be sent 
to the Council by the end of the week. 
  Observers think President Aristide's statements before the 
commission constitute indirect and harsh criticism of the new 
plan supported by Washington, a plan which does not propose a 
date for the return of the president-in-exile to his country. 
During a speech before the commission, Father Aristide pointed 
out the bloodthirsty, ferocious, barbarous nature of the current 
dictatorship in Haiti, enumerating a long list of violations 
committed by General Raoul Cedras' regime. 
  Aristide said: Today, the genocide continues in the presence 
of the international community. What about the primacy of the 
law? -- he asked commission member-countries, while affirming 
that everyone should shoulder his responsibilities.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] President Aristide intervened 
this morning before the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva. 
During a news conference following the meeting, he opposed the 
pilot study for a resolution that is currently under discussion 
in the Security Council. 
  As I see it, he said, it is a bad project, adding that he 
discussed the project on 1 March in Paris with the head of 
French diplomacy Alain Juppe and with President Francois 
Mitterrand. I came out totally satisfied with those talks, said 
President Aristide. 
  In its current form, according to informed sources, the 
pilot 
study to the Security Council for a resolution does not provide 
a date for the return to Port-au-Prince of President Aristide 
and will make the imposition of new sanctions depend on an 
active search for a settlement by President Aristide. 
  On Saturday [5 March], Aristide is due to go to New York, 
where he will hold talks with UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. He indicated that he is expecting from the 
secretary general specifications on the points the secretary 
intends to discuss in the interview. Aristide added that he 
would promote discussions of Haiti in the Security Council. 
  President Aristide continues to insist that General Cedras' 
resignation precede the nomination of a prime minister in 
Port-au-Prince. He did his best to minimize his divergences with 
the United States, which are the source of the resolution now 
being studied. During his news conference this morning, Father 
Aristide stated that the United States and France were playing a 
positive role in enforcing the return of democracy in Haiti. He 
also stated that he was totally satisfied with the talk that he 
held a few days ago with U.S. ambassador to the Vatican Raymond 
Flynn, but he recognizes that Washington sometimes speaks with 
forked tongue.

  [Excerpts] Within the Haitian parliament, the Washington 
plan for a settlement of the crisis is a cause of discord among 
legislators close to the president-in-exile. The presentation of 
the plan has divided the deputies of the National Front For 
Change and Democracy Parliamentary Bloc, BP-FNCD, which may 
split. It is known that the plan is to be discussed very soon 
during a regular session of the Chamber of Deputies. Edner Jean 
has filed a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Jean] For Pierre-Canel Rindal, one of the 
people who signed the parliamentary plan, the sequence of steps 
of this plan follow a certain political logic. In answer to 
criticism from certain colleagues, Rindal, a deputy from 
Carrefour, thinks an easy -- lazy -- solution, which consists of 
denouncing the paralysis of the Governors Island agreement. 
[sentence as heard] 
  As a statesman and political figure, Rindal says he went to 
Washington seeking a well-balanced political equation to unblock 
the agreement. 
  As regards differences on the strategy for the exiled 
president's return that are shaking this political bloc, which 
is close to Aristide, Rindal, who is an influential member of 
the BP-FNCD, thinks that Aristide's return must be crafted by 
certain men in situ. 
  [Rindal, in Creole] I think President Aristide has a 
personal 
vision of his return. We, as in situ legislators facing a number 
of realities, have our own way of effecting the return of 
President Aristide. We also think that today, as political 
figures, we have come up with a number of formulas with a view 
to moving beyond the Governors Island agreement, which is 
paralyzed. Our plan does not aim to replace the Governors Island 
agreement; rather, it aims to unfreeze the agreement first, so 
that the different points of the agreement can make their way. 
  [Jean] What is the next step? 
  [Rindal] The next step is the vote by the parliament, so 
that 
the Governors Island agreement is released and everyone is 
accountable for his signature on it. 
  [Jean] Deputy Fignole Jean-Louis is not willing to ratify 
this plan. Moreover, the parliament does not have the authority 
to ratify such a plan if it is not presented in the form of a 
resolution. Fignole Jean-Louis, who is from Mirebalais and who 
is returning from an extended stay abroad for security reasons, 
is ready to go over to the opposition and fight this plan, a 
plan made entirely in America for the purpose of creating a 
favorable atmosphere for applying Article 148 of the 
Constitution. Jean-Louis accuses those signing this plan of 
tagging along behind certain prime ministers. 
  [Jean-Louis] We do not yet know exactly what game is being 
played right now. The problem is not that they [not further 
unidentified] want the president to appoint a prime minister. I 
would not have any problem with that. The problem is that there 
are a number of proposals that would push President Aristide, as 
regards appointing a prime minister. If, however, President 
Aristide could appoint a prime minister within the scope of the 
Constitution, I do not have a problem with that. The prime 
minister they want for President Aristide, however, is a prime 
minister they want to impose on him. Even if they have not yet 
made the name public, it is a prime minister who tags along 
behind certain international powers; that prime minister is 
already primed and will be forced to bring about what the people 
who primed him want. 
  [Jean] The other [word indistinct] of BP-FNCD prefers to 
play 
the role of a firefighter, attempting to contain the various 
opinions that risk exacerbating relations among the deputies of 
the BP-FNCD. Deputy Serge Jean-Louis rejects any idea of a split 
in the BP-FNCD because of the sharp disagreements. 
  Serge Jean-Louis, who is from Marchand, condemns the 
attitude 
of most of his colleagues, who are criticizing -- without 
reservation -- the FNCD legislators who participated in the 
Washington talks. [passage omitted] 
  One could say that the coming days may perhaps reveal a 
number of conflicts of political interest that have always 
divided the parliamentary coalition that backs Aristide's 
return. The Washington plan, a real seed of discord, risks 
drawing a dividing line between the FNCD and Lavalas deputies.

  [Text] Another approach has been observed in the Senate of 
the Republic to the question of the formation of an ad hoc 
government. The subject was raised on 1 March in camera. The 
contested 18 January elected senators and those of the Alliance 
for Parliamentary Cohesion are allegedly determined to fill the 
vacuum at the executive level, according to Senator Amos Andre. 
  [Begin recording] [Andre in Creole] We senators of the 
Republic, as a power and a state institution -- coguardians of 
the national sovereignty -- are working relentlessly to offer 
the country a government, a government issued from the country's 
Constitution and laws. 
  [Reporter Jean] The country's Constitution and laws -- 
Articles 148 and 149, while the president of this office speaks 
of Article 111? 
  [Andre] I do not want to go into Articles 148, 149, and 111. 
We are simply working on a solution based on the Constitution. 
  [Jean] Will this solution take into account President 
Aristide's position, which you have restored, as well as the 
position of the international community, which Sen. Sansaricq 
has recent visited? 
  [Andre] When we make a decision within the scope of the 
Constitution as the Senate of the Republic, it is not because it 
would please this person or that person, it is simply that it is 
a legal decision. Another aspect of the question -- since we 
are in a context of crisis, where political interests are at 
stake -- is that some political compromises must be made on both 
sides in order to find a solution to the crisis. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi </F>
Sanin by program director Dario Arizmendi; from "Caracol's 0600 
to 0900" newscast; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Arizmendi] We have Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi 
Sanin on the telephone; good morning. 
  [Sanin] Good morning, Dario. 
  [Arizmendi] What is the government's position on the results 
of President Cesar Gaviria's trip to Japan? The president is on 
his way back to Colombia. 
  [Sanin] The trip was a complete success in every aspect. He 
was successful when he appeared before businessmen to seek 
investments and economic support, when he appeared at 
universities and parliament, during his meeting with the emperor 
and Japanese prime minister. He was successful in all the 
meetings he held. He secured financial support for Cusiana, 
(Diarari), and Calima III, for all the projects for which he 
requested financial support. The trip produced wonderful 
results. 
  [Arizmendi] The president has asked Japan to back Colombia's 
bid to become an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] 
member. This membership is theoretically impossible until 1996. 
How important is it for Colombia to form part of that 
organization? 
  [Sanin] It would mean our full incorporation into the 
Pacific 
region. We already belong to (Pibec) [not further identified]. 
This is the product of a big effort by this government. This 
has meant the arrival of the private sector into Pacific forums. 
We will be received in Malaysia in March as a full-rights 
associate member of (TOP), the Economic Council for the Pacific, 
where the private sector, the government, and the academy [not 
further identified] have working groups and form associations to 
strengthen ties among Pacific countries. 
  Private businessmen will be able to establish links with 
30,000 enterprises and will be able to trade, look for 
investments, and exchange technological experiences. We [words 
indistinct] but crowned our efforts with success. This has 
been, perhaps, one of our foreign policy's best accomplishments. 
The next step by APEC will be to link all the Pacific 
countries, including the United States and Canada. 
  APEC aims to associate with the academic, political, and 
private points of view, all the countries of America and the 
Asian Pacific, the entire Pacific. We are working in that 
direction. We are participating in the forums in which we must 
participate. We are getting ready. I think the president's 
visit to Japan was of definite importance for our entrance into 
the grand Pacific project, because we were able to demonstrate 
our interest on that. 
  I think we are embarking on a road toward the future, 
because 
progress in the financial and service sectors, in technology, in 
all the most important sector, including the academic sector, is 
taking place in the Pacific. 
  [Arizmendi] A former Venezuelan foreign minister has again 
launched verbal attacks against Colombia in recent hours. Now 
he has called for solidarity from certain neighboring countries 
to demand that Colombia change its position. The Colombian 
Foreign Ministry has maintained relative silence on the 
declarations by Ochoa Antich. Will it maintain this silence, or 
will it be necessary to respond more strongly to Ochoa? 
  [Sanin] Former Foreign Minister Ochoa Antich is a Venezuelan 
[words indistinct] Colombia had very close relations with him. 
When he was foreign minister we obviously had to respond to his 
statements. We agreed at that time with many of his statements 
and did not agree with certain others. When this happened, we 
had to express our opinion, but Ochoa is now a politician, a 
columnist. His opinions are not official; thus it would be 
unwise for me to exchange opinions with him every time he, as a 
politician, issues his own opinions, because then we would be 
acting also as politicians, and we would then face very 
difficult relations with a country, Venezuela, with which we 
want to maintain the best relations possible. 
  [Arizmendi] Nonetheless, he charged that through you 
Colombia has apparently offered to support and vote for Dr. 
Burelli Rivas so he could aspire to the post of OAS secretary 
general. What is the truth of this charge? 
  [Sanin] I believe, first, we should not have described that 
as a charge. We have seen countries such as Argentina change 
positions once President Gaviria's candidacy was presented. 
Argentina now fully supports Colombia, and that is the Latin 
American position. The idea is to have a leader, a great 
spokesman at the OAS, the most important organization of the 
hemisphere. In the case you mentioned, however, Colombia never 
made a commitment. 
  We held a meeting on that day in which President Ramon J. 
Velasquez presented Venezuela's hopes that we support the 
current Venezuelan foreign minister. We praised his personality 
and work; he had been a very good ambassador to Colombia. 
Perhaps this was mistaken for support. I think this is a 
problem of interpretation, and we cannot continue to dwell on 
this or turn it into a diplomatic problem or conflict. 
Actually, there was no commitment. We have not written any 
letter supporting the Venezuelan candidacy. We respect it. He 
is a highly qualified and experienced person, but we did not 
commit ourselves. I think this is a problem of 
misinterpretation. 
  [Arizmendi] A problem has come up recently at the OAS in 
light of the various candidacies that are being discussed. 
Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus Quesada, who is 
another strong candidate to become the OAS secretary general, 
has affirmed to the media he has at least 22 votes. Caracol has 
asked questions among diplomatic sources, and it has been able 
to determine that Colombia has from eight to nine votes and that 
Niehaus has 15 written votes. At least 18 votes are needed for 
election. What are the possibilities today of President Cesar 
Gaviria's hopes for OAS secretary general? 
  [Sanin] When the president told Colombians and the 
international public he accepted the nomination made by the 
heads of state for the post of OAS secretary general, he said 
according to consultations we had made, including via the 
Colombian Foreign Ministry, he had solid support; that is the 
impression I have. I think we have the necessary and sufficient 
votes so that as of 7 August, the president of the Republic will 
become the OAS secretary general. 
  [Arizmendi] As of the first round? 
  [Sanin] I think so; that is for what I am hoping, and I am 
working on that. I think that will be the case. According to 
what I have been told, that is the way it will be. Even though 
Foreign Minister Niehaus has given those figures.... [pauses] 
Not so long ago, he was giving other figures. First he 
mentioned 22 votes, and it seems he will have less and less as 
the days go by. 
  I do not want to talk about figures or numbers of votes. We 
are hoping President Gaviria's nomination will be the candidacy 
of unity and that it will express the spirit of Latin America. 
Let's hope it will be the result of a consensus, although it is 
very difficult, because candidate Niehaus, as you said, has been 
working on this for two and a half years. He has some votes but 
not the votes he claims to have. Are you sure of the number of 
votes he claims to have at this time? 
  [Arizmendi] Yes. 
  [Sanin] The votes you claim President Gaviria has are very 
far from reality. 
  [Arizmendi] What figures do you have? 
  [Sanin] The truth is the president has sufficient support 
for 
becoming OAS secretary general. 
  [Arizmendi] In this first round? 
  [Sanin] In this first round. Those are our hopes. 
  [Arizmendi] That means he has at least 18 to 19 guaranteed 
votes? 
  [Sanin] [giggling] Yes sir. 
  [Arizmendi] We know Foreign Minister Niehaus has 15 written 
votes; in other words, that would mean 34 votes. Is that 
correct? [giggles] 
  [Sanin] I do not want to count votes; actually, we are 
talking about hemispheric integration, a fluid dialogue, support 
for democracy, and a defense of democracy via cooperation and a 
permanent dialogue. Actually, we are not counting votes. We 
are voicing a message of solidarity, of integration, and of 
cooperation, which are what our hemisphere needs. 
  [Arizmendi] Inasmuch as you have mentioned integration, 
cooperation [words indistinct], and the fact we want good 
relations with Venezuela, things do not seem that easy, not only 
due to this case of the OAS secretary general but also what 
concerns Venezuela's internal economic policy. The private 
sector is very much concerned over how this will affect 
business, for example, if there is a devaluation of the bolivar. 
There is also a concern over the future of the Group of Three, 
[words indistinct] economic integration after what President 
Caldera has done. 
  [Sanin] I want to tell you in these days I have stayed in 
Colombia I have been speaking with Colombian entrepreneurs, with 
exporters, with many politicians who are interested in this 
subject. I have had a very fluid dialogue with the Venezuelan 
foreign minister, as well as in Mexico when we attended an OAS 
cooperation meeting. Yesterday, we had a very lengthy telephone 
conversation. He told me the following, and this is something 
the Venezuelan president had already told me: First of all, 
there will not be a massive devaluation in Venezuela. He told 
me we could rest assured in this regard. Second, he said there 
will not be an exchange crisis. Third, they support 
integration, are committed to this; they want to work for 
integration and defend it, just as we do. 
  The Venezuelan president was one of the builders of the 
Andean Pact, and he strongly believes in it. Thus, they 
continue with the idea of defending integration at all costs. 
They had to take certain very strong measures to defend the 
financial sector. The foreign minister told me all banks will 
open as of Friday. I believe one bank had been closed. 
Measures were adopted so that this financial crisis would not 
harm the depositors so much. They are adopting strong measures, 
attacking a crisis with solutions. I feel integration is 
irreversible. Obviously, the macroeconomic measures will have 
to be consulted more, and sometimes there will be people who 
favor the exports from one or another country, but I have the 
impression we are not going to have any big problems for the 
time being. This is what the foreign minister told me, and 
these are the guarantees he gave me. 
  [Arizmendi] There is a scandal in the United States with 
Maria del Rosario Casas, our former cultural attache at the 
Colombian Embassy in Mexico. You requested from Gabriel Silva 
Lujan, the Colombian ambassador to Washington, that he formally 
request an explanation from the State Department regarding the 
entire case. Have you received a reply? 
  [Sanin] Yes, because.... [pauses] I cannot understand how a 
friendly nation such as the United States can hire a Colombian 
diplomatic official for intelligence work. I find that 
unacceptable under any point of view. 
  I spoke to our ambassador to the White House yesterday and 
asked him what news he had on the issue. He explained to me the 
case is before the courts, and while it is in the judiciary 
stage we will not have an answer. I will keep the public 
informed of the case, because, as I said before, I cannot 
understand this affair. 
  [Arizmendi] Could we be on the verge of a formal protest 
note 
to the U.S. Government over the CIA hiring an attache--an 
official from our embassy--as a spy at its service? 
  [Sanin] I prefer not to speak of that. The only thing I must 
state strongly is that I fully disagree with any country using 
the services of a diplomatic official who is obligated by ethics 
and the law to defend the interests of his or her country in 
functions that are totally different from serving the fatherland. 
  [Arizmendi] We thank you very much for making these 
statements to "Caracol's 0600-0900" newscast. 
  To conclude, we have another question. You are constantly 
being mentioned as a running mate for any of the two 
presidential candidates--the conservative Andres Pastrana or the 
liberal Ernesto Samper Pizano--for vice president of the 
Republic. Are you restricted by the law or by a resolution of 
the State Council? 
  [Sanin] I have not had time to see whether I am qualified; 
nonetheless, you give me good news when you say I might be a 
running mate for any of the two candidates, because all I want 
is to serve Colombians, regardless of political parties.... 
  [Arizmendi, interrupting] Which one would you prefer? 
  [Sanin] No, I am not going to get involved in political 
affairs. I am very happy serving Colombia's interests, 
representing Colombia. For the time being, I am not going to 
get involved in politics. 
  [Arizmendi] Not for the time being, but how about in the 
future? Would you like that someday? 
  [Sanin] One cannot commit oneself to the future, because 
each day brings something new. I always uphold that. Forgive 
me for repeating this. I am a person of faith, and I think God 
points out the paths He wants us to follow. I do not put 
conditions on my life. One thing I will tell you: My policy is 
to serve Colombia, to interpret an international policy, that of 
President Gaviria and of the country, of the new Constitution. 
I feel very happy as foreign minister, and I am not thinking of 
anything different for the time being.
