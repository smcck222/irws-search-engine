  [Text] In a news release, Chamber of Deputies President 
Frantz Robert Monde deplores the carelessness with which Arthur 
Spiegelman of REUTERS reported on the 1 March meeting of the 
delegation of Haitian parliamentarians Frantz Robert Monde, Duly 
Brutus, Jean-Eddy Talendier [Desjardins], and Dr. Antoine Joseph 
with the Army high command. 
  For the record and as president of the Chamber of Deputies 
and president of that delegation, Bob Monde makes a point of 
explaining that Deputy Joseph Lambert, who was quoted by 
(Spiegelman) as the source who provided information, was not 
part of the delegation and was not present at that meeting; that 
Colonel Dorelien's intervention simply hinted at civil war if 
the parties do not decide to find an acceptable solution to the 
crisis; and that General Cedras -- despite his reservations and 
questions -- stated during this meeting that he is not attached 
to the post of commander in chief and that the sacrifice of his 
career is conditioned on guarantees for the institution he heads 
and for improved living conditions for the Haitian people who 
have been so harshly afflicted by the embargo. 
  Monde went on to say: As president of the Chamber of 
Deputies, I have decided to continue dialogue with all sectors 
interested in [finding] a solution to the crisis, especially 
with the high command of the Haitian Armed Forces, whose 
flexibility I could test during this meeting. This is signed by 
Frantz Robert Monde, president of the Chamber of Deputies, and 
dated 10 March.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 Mar (EFE) -- Argentina, Brazil, 
Paraguay, and Uruguay -- the countries that are partners in the 
Common Market of the South (Mercosur) -- have decided to ratify 
that they will negotiate as a bloc their possible joining of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the United 
States, Canada, and Mexico. 
  Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella said that the 
decision "is the most important political fact" in the meeting 
of the ministers of economy and foreign affairs of the Mercosur 
countries, which ended today in Buenos Aires. 
  "There are ways to make Mercosur compatible with NAFTA, and 
this is what we are studying," Di Tella added. 
  The deliberations in Buenos Aires seem to have given 
definition to the Argentine position, which at one point was 
considering the possibility of unilaterally joining NAFTA upon 
invitation by the United States. 
  The Mercosur countries will now study how to reactivate the 
negotiations known as "four plus one," begun two years ago, that 
aim at approaching the North American commercial bloc. 
  The Mercosur ministers also agreed to study all the options 
for promoting broad regional economic integration, on the basis 
of a Brazilian proposal to create the South American Free Trade 
Association (ALCSA). 
  The ministers avoided, however, resuming discussions on the 
Mexican decision to refrain from extending the concessions 
obtained within NAFTA to the other Latin American countries, 
diplomatic sources have said. 
  The matter, which has been a source of conflict, has been 
awaiting resolution since the last Latin American Integration 
Association (ALADI) meeting held in Montevideo in February. 
  The proposal to create ALCSA, which was raised in October 
1993, was formally presented to the Mercosur ministers by the 
Brazilian ministers of finance and of foreign affairs, Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso and Celso Amorim respectively. 
  Cardoso told EFE that the initiative "does not go against 
anybody, and seeks to preserve the Latin American bloc and 
strengthen regional commerce," thus denying that it is an 
attempt "to put the brakes on a commercial invasion" by NAFTA 
members. 
  Brazil, South America's most developed country, sells 13 
percent of its exports to Mercosur and 8 percent to the other 
South American countries. 
  Cardoso said that his country has not considered the 
possibility of joining NAFTA "because we cannot take the 
initiative; we have not been invited." 
  "The idea is to promote commercial liberalization, but 
always 
on the basis of the consolidation of Mercosur as an 
institutional structure and as an organization for joint 
negotiations for the entire continent," Uruguayan Foreign 
Minister Sergio Abreu said. 
  Uruguay maintains that "everything is compatible, provided 
the obligations assumed under Mercosur are complied with and 
provided there is a common foreign policy toward third 
countries." 
  The Brazilians proposed that the South American Free Trade 
Zone come into operation 10 years after 1 January 1995, the day 
when Mercosur will become fully operational. Mercosur is 
considered the "nucleus" of the integration process. 
  This means that Mercosur commercial policies should be 
coordinated with those of the Andean Pact, which is made up of 
Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, and with 
Chilean policies. 
  The Mercosur area has a population of 190 million people, 
with a gross domestic product equivalent to slightly more than 
50 percent of Latin America's total GDP.

  [Excerpts] Victor Manuel Rebolledo, the minister secretary 
of government designate, yesterday pointed out that U.S. 
authorities are favorably disposed toward incorporating Chile 
into NAFTA. 
  "The time is ripe for the Clinton administration to propose 
that Chile join NAFTA and for the U.S. Congress to put the 
approval of such a proposal on the `fast track' [preceding two 
words in English]," he stressed. 
  Rebolledo explained that pursuant to U.S. domestic 
regulations, the executive branch must submit for Congress' 
approval the names of the countries with which the United States 
intends to sign a free trade agreement. 
  He moreover stated that both nations might initiate 
negotiations on this issue during the second half of this year. 
  In any case, the minister-designate -- a PPD [Party for 
Democracy] deputy at present -- asserted that Chile is deemed 
the "natural candidate to sign a free trade agreement with the 
United States." 
  Rebolledo reported that this was one of the main 
achievements 
of the recent trip he made to the United States at the 
invitation of the U.S.-Chilean Chamber of Commerce. 
  Besides his scheduled activities with U.S. businessmen 
having 
an interest in Chile, Rebolledo took advantage of his stay in 
the United States to meet with government officials. [passage 
omitted] 
  Upon being asked about a possible visit to the United States 
by Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle once he assumes office as president, 
Rebolledo noted that in order for the new president to do so, he 
needs to be officially invited by the U.S. Government first. 
  Notwithstanding this, he said that in view of what he 
noticed 
during his contacts with U.S. Government officials, the Clinton 
administration might "be planning to have the president visit 
the United States during the course of this year." [passage 
omitted] 
  Rebolledo further stated that U.S. Vice President Al Gore 
has 
proposed holding a hemispheric summit meeting during the second 
half of this year which would be attended by all the heads of 
state from the Americas. 
  He remarked that he hopes that Chile will be able to play an 
important role both in the arrangement and the development of 
this summmit.

  [Text] The Federal Police arrested former Bolivian 
President Luis Garcia Meza in Sao Paulo this morning. The 
former president was hiding in an apartment located in a 
neighborhood close to the airport and carried a false Brazilian 
passport. He was taken into custody together with his 
aide-de-camp, Colonel Roberto Rico. Both of them had been 
charged with being implicated in an international drug 
trafficking network. Garcia Meza had been sentenced to 30 
years' imprisonment and was a fugitive from Bolivian justice.

  [Text] Today we received one of the most important pieces 
of news of the year, a true happening, a news bomb, if you 
permit me the exaggeration, because it is something really 
significant. 
  The arrest of former President Luis Garcia Meza has been 
officially confirmed. The news has shaken the country. The 
capture occurred in Brazil. But I would prefer that Minister of 
Government German Quiroga inform you himself, through a special 
note prepared by Gabriela Orosco at Government Palace. The 
minister made official what we advanced at noon today. This is 
the official communique, read around 1230. 
  [Begin Quiroga recording] The government reports to the 
public the following: 
  1. Citizen Luis Garcia Meza, former de facto president of 
Bolivia, who was condemned by the Supreme Court to 30 years 
imprisonment without pardon, was captured early today in the 
Brazilian city of Sao Paulo. 
  2. Citizen Garcia Meza surrendered without offering 
resistance. He was captured while returning to his residence. 
Garcia Meza was staying in that city with false documents. 
  3. This has been an operation coordinated by Bolivian and 
Brazilian authorities working together. 
  4. The Foreign Ministry is taking steps before the 
Brazilian Government to extradite Garcia Meza to Bolivia. 
  This is all the information we can release at this time. 
Thank you. [end recording] 
  This was what the minister of government said in making 
official what was learned unofficially through the state channel 
at noon today. 
  Let us ratify the information. Luis Garcia Meza was arrested 
at Guarulhos Airport -- one of the two international airports in 
that important Brazilian city -- by the airport police at around 
0800 this morning. At the time of his arrest he was accompanied 
by Gualberto Rico, who was one of his assistants during his 
1980-1981 dictatorship. Rico was arrested for carrying false 
documents. The airport police arrested Garcia Meza on charges 
of carrying false identity documents. 
  Two possibilities are being studied: first, his extradition; 
and second, that he be expelled to Bolivia. Apparently the 
Brazilian Government does not want anything to do with Garcia 
Meza; it does not want to hold him a single minute longer than 
necessary, and it might want to deliver him to Bolivian 
authorities immediately. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Delfin Arias Vargas] </F>
  [Text] Even though Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz 
said on 26 February that the so-called "Option Zero" -- which 
envisages the total eradication of surplus coca plantations -- 
is only a proposal and that its implementation depends on the 
international community providing the necessary economic aid, 
peasant leaders assert that it is already under way. 
  Soliz stated: "`Option Zero' is just a proposal. We must 
study it. This will take some time. No definite decision has 
been taken. It is a proposal by certain echelons of the 
government that we must assess. We must see what funds are 
available to implement it in the Chapare region." 
  In the view of several peasant leaders who spoke to this 
daily on the evening of 26 February, the violent action 
yesterday by FELCN [Special Antinarcotics Force] personnel in 
Chapare proves that the "proposal" to eradicate surplus 
plantations is already underway. Minister of Government German 
Quiroga denied such an outrage. 
  Soliz stated that until the proposal is made official, the 
U.S. Embassy in Bolivia cautiously awaits an outcome while 
monitoring further developments in the problem with coca growers. 
  He said: "They are waiting to make a more thorough 
assessment 
and to see how much money can be collected for this project. 
This must be supported by nations and international 
organizations with which we have friendly ties and which can 
give us the necessary funding." 
  This cautious U.S. stance was maintained by George A. 
Auflick, the DEA chief in Bolivia who, during a brief encounter 
with the press yesterday, declined to comment. 
  Soliz denied that opposition by the peasants to eradication 
will lead to clashes with Coca Eradication Directorate (Direco) 
officials who -- supported by FELCN troops -- have already 
eradicated some surplus plantations. 
  The tense atmosphere in Chapare robs Soliz's optimistic 
words 
of any credibility. 
  "The peasants are well aware that we are acting within the 
law. Moreover, the volume of plantations eradicated so far is 
negligible," he stated, emphasizing that the eradication of "a 
few hectares of illegal plantations" was done near where 
maceration pits had been discovered by the FELCN and that were 
used exclusively for the production of cocaine paste. 
  Given the desire to fully eradicate surplus plantations, the 
five coca growers federations from Chapare demand what they call 
"Option One" -- the expulsion of all DEA agents. 
  During a interview with PRESENCIA last week, Soliz conceded 
that the proposal should be given careful consideration although 
he stated he did not know the reasons for this demand. 
  He said: "We cannot decide yet on something that we still do 
not know about ("Option One"), but we will certainly assess the 
role the DEA is playing in our country." 
  He added: "We must see how it can be beneficial for the 
country and how not. I believe we must investigate and 
seriously analyze what is right for us and what should be 
definitely discarded because it does not suit us." 
  On 14 February, coca growers from Chapare alleged that FELCN 
personnel, in coordination with DEA agents and Direco officials, 
compulsorily eradicated coca plantations. 
  This action is considered by peasants as the start of the 
total eradication of their plantations under the so-called 
"Option Zero." Even though this was denied by Soliz, he 
acknowledged that "there is concern in Chapare over what has 
been done (the eradication of illegal coca plantations) in 
keeping with the law." 
  This assessment sharply contrasts with that of coca growers, 
who noted that "they will not allow their plantations to be 
eradicated." 
  During a rally of coca growers last 18 February, Felix 
Santos, a peasants' leader, expressed this feeling by openly 
challenging the country's drug enforcement agencies. He stated: 
"If enforcement agencies kick us, we will club them; if they 
destroy our plantations, we will cut off their hands." 
  In light of the determination of the government, the 
peasants 
are demanding that "Option One" be implemented. Their leaders 
explained that this option entails the expulsion of all DEA 
agents, which could be analyzed by the government although there 
is a very remote possibility of this happening because U.S. 
economic aid to our country foresees the eradication of 
plantations. Let us hope this does not bring serious 
consequences in its wake.

  [Excerpts] La Paz, 27 Feb -- While being evicted from the 
Direco [Coca Reduction Directorate] offices in Ivirgarzama -- in 
the subtropical region of Cochabamba Department early on the 
morning of 26 February -- three peasants were injured and 60 
were arrested and later released. 
  Minister of Government German Quiroga supplied this 
information and denied that anyone had been killed, as certain 
news media had reported. He said firearms were not used to 
evict over 1,500 peasants who invaded the Direco offices 
protesting the alleged compulsory eradication of their coca 
plantations. [passage omitted] 
  The minister reported that approximately 70 coca maceration 
pits have been discovered in the outskirts of Ivirgarzama in 
recent weeks. It is estimated that these maceration pits 
produced 3.5 metric tons of cocaine base per month. The 
discovery of these pits was the main cause for the eradication 
of some plantations in compliance with current laws. There was 
no compulsory eradication of plantations as claimed by the 
peasants who invaded the Direco offices in Ivirgarzama 
  Minister Quiroga said: "Relative calm has been restored and 
an agreement has been reached with the five federations of the 
tropical area of Cochabamba Department to begin talks during the 
first week of March to fully explain what Mobile Police Unit for 
Rural Areas personnel are doing and to give peasants the chance 
to speak." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Pronk Wants To Talk To Suriname in </F>
New York"] 
  [Text] Paramaribo -- Cooperation and Development Minister 
Pronk has suggested to his Surinamese counterpart, R. Assen, 
that they talk about the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) for 
the economy in New York on 19 March. 
  Paramaribo accepted the invitation and has approached the 
Warwick Research Institute (British university) to act as 
adviser. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) will be there 
for the Netherlands. 
  Pronk's invitation is a reaction to the Surinamese proposal 
of 24 February to begin talks as quickly as possible on a 
solution to the lingering question of external guidance for the 
SAP. In Paramaribo, emotions were running high this week 
following the sharp criticism levelled by Pronk at the 
Surinamese approach to the economic crisis. However, with the 
indignant statement made by Assen on the matter, the question 
would appear to be over. 
  The Netherlands is still demanding that Suriname takes on 
the 
IMF as an external adviser for the SAP before there can be any 
talk of resuming economic aid. However, Paramaribo wants to 
throw in its lot with Warwick. Warwick, however, only wants to 
give technical assistance and is "not prepared nor in a 
position" to coercively enforce the required measures, nor to 
advise The Hague on resuming aid.

<F P=106> [Address by President Eduardo Frei outside La Moneda Palace </F>
in Santiago -- live] 
  [Text] Chileans: I want to start this brief speech by 
voicing my gratitude to all of those who have given me your 
support and affection, which I want and hope to return with my 
great dedication to the hopes of all our fellow countrymen, and 
especially the most modest, the have-nots. [applause] 
  Our government will take into account the dreams and 
ambitions of Chilean men, women, and children. I also want to 
greet those students who passed their university entry exams 
with flying colors, who are with us now as special guests. 
[applause] 
  We are aware of our responsibilities and the difficulties of 
the task we are undertaking today. But, as I have repeatedly 
stated during the recent presidential campaign, I firmly believe 
this generation can wipe out extreme poverty from our country; 
that we can renew and expand our infrastructure; that we will 
substantially increase the GDP and our exports, change the 
structure of our education system, grow in a sustained manner, 
improve the peoples' living standards, and solve the peoples' 
concrete problems. 
  After these four years of socioeconomic growth and 
restoration of democracy we have an excellent opportunity, which 
we will not miss. This is an equal opportunity for all Chileans. 
This afternoon I also want to greet President Patricio Aylwin, 
who has bequeathed us a great legacy from his years in 
government. [applause] 
  The new times have started. It is not just a plan; it is a 
new phase in Chilean development. We must reorganize government 
in face of all the changes we are currently witnessing; we need 
to implement changes in the distribution of political power at 
the district, regional, and national level; we must bring about 
changes in the relationship between the public and private 
sectors, and changes in the role we play in the international 
arena. In sum, this is the beginning of a new historical phase, 
which we know, now that it is starting, will conclude when each 
and every Chilean decides to make an effort for the well-being 
of all Chileans. [applause] 
  Tomorrow afternoon, here in Constitution Square, I will 
announce the style of my government. 
  The La Moneda Palace building, where I arrived today in my 
capacity as president of the Chilean people, is witness to the 
history of our institutions, the strength of their servants, and 
the righteousness of our politicians. 
  From this site I humbly ask God to keep us on this path of 
service and effort. 
  With faith in Chile, in its people, and its future, deeply 
moved and thankful, I greet you all. 
  The men who governed Chile from here with effort, 
dedication, 
and love for the fatherland are responsible for the Chile we 
have today. We will continue to work with national awareness. 
With your support and that of all Chileans, we are going to 
bring politics and the people and their daily problems together. 
We are going to work hard every day to be with you, to solve 
the daily problems of millions of Chileans, and we are going to 
do this observing the high moral and ethical political standards 
that are necessary for the times we are experiencing. [applause] 
  I urge the Chilean people and, through you, the millions and 
millions of Chileans that have given us their support, to help 
me, to help carry out this beautiful task of building a unified 
country. I urge them to accompany me in this beautiful task, 
because the task of building and dreaming of the future, the 
task of building and dreaming of a developed and unified country 
at the threshold of the 21st century, is a task that concerns 
all Chileans. I am going to head this task, and with your 
support we will be successful; we are going to enter the 21st 
century as a unified, progressive country in which each and 
every Chilean feels part of a human country, feels that he has 
an opportunity. Let us walk with confidence and optimism, with 
faith in Chile's future. Let us go ahead. Long live Chile. 
[applause]

  [Excerpts] Santiago, 12 Mar (EFE) -- Today Chilean 
President Eduardo Frei Ruiz Tagle, who took over on 11 March, 
will announce the main guidelines of his administration which 
will have the support of the same political alliance that backed 
up his predecessor Patricio Aylwin. 
  Rather than talking about "continuity," however, the new 
administration is announcing "new times", innovations and new 
initiatives. [passage omitted] 
  Interior Minister German Correa, from the Socialist Party, 
has announced that in the speech Frei will make today "he will 
outline the key objectives of his administration." 
  One of the main differences between Aylwin and Frei, a 
militant Christian Democrat just like his predecessor, is that 
the Frei has appointed a Socialist as interior minister and 
chief of cabinet. 
  Correa will also play the role of vice president whenever 
President Frei travels abroad. [passsage omitted] 
  Yet another difference between Aylwin and Frei is that the 
latter did not ask or receive suggestions from political parties 
that make up the government coalition for the appointment of 
ministers, under secretaries and other government officials. 
This attitude displeased several people, even some members of 
the Christian Democratic Party, the largest component of the 
ruling coalition. 
  Today's presidential agenda includes several bilateral 
meetings with visiting dignitaries, beginning with Peruvian 
President Alberto Fujimori. Later on Frei will meet with 
Brazilian President Itamar Franco, Paraguayan President Juan 
Carlos Wasmosy, and OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares. 
  The meetings will continue throughout the afternoon and at 
the end of the day there will be a rally at Plaza Constitucion, 
right in front of La Moneda Palace. On this occasion President 
Frei will make a speech in which he will outline the objectives 
of his 6-year term in office. 
  [Santiago Television Nacional de Chile Imagen Internacional 
in Spanish at 1259 GMT on 12 March reports that "at 1115 local 
time (1415 GMT) President Frei will briefly attend a reception 
at the Santiago City Hall and will begin his meetings with 
foreign dignitaries at 1130 local time. The formal reception 
that President Frei will offer to special guests at Plaza 
Constitucion will last from 2030 to 2300 local time."]

  [Text] Santiago, Chile, 13 Mar (EFE) -- New Chilean 
President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle today said that he will not 
ask General Augusto Pinochet to resign as commander in chief of 
the Army, a post he will hold until 1997. 
  In his first news conference with local and foreign 
reporters, Frei said he will not emulate his predecessor 
Patricio Aylwin, who after his inauguration in March 1990 hinted 
to Pinochet that he should resign. 
  The new Chilean ruler said he will not tamper with the 
constitutional provision that establishes the permanence of 
military chiefs until 1997. Frei added, however, that he would 
promote constitutional reforms to again empower the president to 
appoint armed forces chiefs. 
  Frei emphasized that his relations with the Army and other 
defense institutions "will be impersonal" [as received] to 
ensure that such bodies also help the country face its great 
challenges and embark on a new phase of development. 
  Frei said that recent Air Force and the Army weapons 
purchases are not part of an arms race but the unavoidable 
renewal of already obsolete weapons. 
  The country needs an armed forces that is modern and ready 
to 
fulfill its mission of defending the country's territorial 
sovereignty and security, Frei added. The president said that 
weapons expenditures are not contrary to his political goals of 
overcoming the extreme poverty that affects more than 1 million 
Chileans. 
  Frei added that the armed forces are absolutely subordinate 
to civilian power.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jose Meirelles Passos] </F>
  [Text] Washington -- General Barry McCaffrey, new commander 
of the U.S. Southern Command, who is responsible for all U.S. 
military activities in Latin America and for the implementation 
of President Bill Clinton's security strategy in the region, 
will arrive in Brazil on 15 March on a five-day visit to our 
country. Diplomatic circles consider his having chosen Brazil 
for his first visit to Latin America to be a significant 
political gesture. McCaffrey yesterday said his objective is to 
"improve the strong professional relationship" between the 
servicemen of the two countries. 
  In truth, this is the beginning of a relaxation in the 
relationship between the Brazilian and U.S. Armed Forces, which 
have recently experienced difficulties due to the training of 
U.S. troops on the Brazilian border, without the participation 
of the Brazilian Armed Forces. 
  During a recent visit to Washington, Foreign Minister Celso 
Amorim said that "the relationship deteriorated recently because 
there was the feeling that the United States was granting other 
Latin American countries more cooperation. The fact that the 
United States considered that the Brazilian military should 
fight drug trafficking also caused unrest in our barracks. We 
need to reverse that climate." 
  Since then, Brazilian Ambassador to Washington Paulo Tarso 
Flecha de Lima has been in frequent contact with the Pentagon, 
seeking to smooth the creases. He, for example, was the only 
Latin American ambassador to attend General McCaffrey's 
swearing-in as commander of the Southern Command on 17 February. 
  Flecha de Lima revealed that one of the main obstacles in 
the 
relationship between the Brazilian Armed Forces and the Pentagon 
began to be removed a few days ago. The ambassador explained 
that the problem was caused by a curious technical problem: No 
Brazilian military representative in Washington had ever been 
invited to Pentagon briefings (meeting during which the 
Pentagon's official reports are distributed) because Brazil, 
instead of having a defense minister as in other countries, has 
three military ministers. There are therefore three military 
attaches in the Brazilian Embassy in Washington. As the United 
States only invites one military representative from each 
country, it did not know which of the three Brazilian military 
representatives to invite -- because to privilege one branch 
could give the impression that the other two were being ignored. 
This has been diplomatically settled using the seniority 
criteria: the most senior military representative will represent 
Brazil. 
  General McCaffrey will be welcomed in Brasilia by General 
Geise Ferrari, commander of the Army's land operations.

<F P=106> [By Carlos Alberto Sardenberg] </F>
  [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso should be 
going to Washington next week to conclude the negotiations with 
the International Monetary Fund. An agreement with the IMF is a 
precondition for signing an accord for rescheduling the debt 
that Brazil owes to private banks. 
  An IMF mission that was in Brasilia discussing the Brazilian 
Government budget yesterday returned to the United States 
without having made a final decision. Economic Policy Secretary 
Winston Fritsch said there is no more disagreement about 
figures. A Brazilian technical mission will just the same visit 
Washington over the weekend to arrange the final details. 
Brazilian accounts are not easy to understand, if nothing else 
because the inflation rate is never known. 
  According to the foreign debt agreement timetable, the 
agreement with the IMF should have been ready on 10 March. The 
delay, which will be of approximately one week, was caused by 
the Brazilian Government's delay -- Congress is also responsible 
for it -- in voting on the Social Emergency Fund and the other 
measures for balancing public accounts. 
  Furthermore, the accounts of a country with a high, chronic, 
and diversified inflation rate are a mess. Which inflation rate 
should be considered, that in cruzeiros -- which will disappear 
-- or that in reals -- the new currency? There are complex 
exchanges of funds between different government organs. The 
Central Bank, for example, makes profits through monetary 
correction of securities from the Treasury, which is the debtor. 
Yet the Central Banks returns this money to the Treasury, and 
the accounts are thus neutralized. In the middle of all these 
figures an IMF technician said during one of the sessions: "I 
am totally lost."

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- Hitoshi Tanabe, 32, one of the most 
wanted members of the Japanese mafia (Yakuza), was arrested on 7 
March on a warrant issued by the Brazilian Supreme Court at the 
request of the Japanese Government. Tanabe is the leader of 
Dinshoukai, a faction of Yamaguchi-gumi, one of the main mafia 
organizations in Japan. The Federal Police [PF] arrested him in 
Londrina, Parana State. 
  Police officer Itanor Neves Carneiro said: There are strong 
indications that there are other Yakuza members in the country. 
  The PF suspect that Tanabe came to Brazil to run an 
international drug-trafficking ring and to send Brazilian women 
to Japan to work as prostitutes. The extradition request was 
based on the seizure of 5.8 kg of cocaine in the Japanese city 
of Shizuoka in February 1993. It was the fifth largest seizure 
of cocaine in Japan, an amount worth $4 million in Japan and 
$90,000 in Brazil. At that time trafficker Takahiro Shiba 
confessed to the Japanese police that the cocaine had come from 
Brazil, and that it belonged to Tanabe. 
  Like most Yakuza members, Tanabe has tattoos on his body 
from 
his chest down to his ankles. Upon his transfer to Sao Paulo, 
Tanabe confirmed that he is a ranking member of Yamaguchi-gumi, 
but declined to give details. Nor did he want to explain why 
one digit of the little finger on his left hand had been severed. 
  Tanabe has a daughter born in Brazil -- Mary, 10 months old 
-- and was living with her and his Japanese wife, Kiyomi, in 
Brazil.

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- During a meeting at his house on the 
evening of 8 March, PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] leader Paulo 
Maluf told his main aides that he will run for president of the 
Republic. Maluf will have to resign as mayor of Sao Paulo on 29 
March. Maluf's decision is not tied to his party's decision to 
form an alliance to support his candidacy. 
  Maluf made the announcement to five of his aides: Planning 
Secretary Claudio Lembo, Finance Secretary Celso Pitta, 
Government Secretary Edevaldo Alves da Silva, Highway Secretary 
Reynaldo de Barros, and Education Secretary Solon Borges, who is 
also the deputy mayor of Sao Paulo. It will be Maluf's third 
attempt to reach Planalto Palace: in 1984 he lost to Tancredo 
Neves at the Electoral College; and in 1989 he lost to Fernando 
Collor. 
  "I have already decided and I want to make it quite clear 
that I have already met with my government team. I am very well 
prepared," he said after lunching in Rio de Janeiro with Globo 
Organization President Roberto Marinho. 
  Claiming he would feel restrained if he announced his 
decision in Rio de Janeiro, Maluf only hinted that he would run 
for president: 
  "I have even studied the timetable. I cannot resign on 2 
April because it is Saturday, and it will be published in the 
official gazette on Monday, which is 4 April. It is not good to 
do it on 1 April, right? March 31 might have a political 
connotation (anniversary of the coup of 1964). I cannot do it 
on 30 March because it will be published by the official gazette 
on 31 March. Consequently, my deadline is 29 March. It will be 
published in the official gazette on 30 March," he said. 
  Maluf reiterated that he would renounce his candidacy in 
favor of Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes (PFL) [Liberal 
Front Party], whose name "appears second in the polls" and who 
cannot be excluded from an alliance among the PPR, the PFL, the 
PP [Popular Party], the PL [Liberal Party], and the PTB 
[Brazilian Labor Party]. 
  Maluf says he had dinner with Antonio Carlos Magalhaes three 
weeks ago. He noted that he will consider it discourteous if 
during a meeting scheduled for today, PFL President Jorge 
Bornhausen proposes that he give up his candidacy. Giving a 
personal example, Maluf criticized the proposed alliance between 
the PFL and the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]: 
  He said: "Just imagine if [Workers Party President] Lula [da 
Silva] and I made an alliance. It would be cynical, 
hypocritical, and would reduce the number of votes for both 
parties. The PFL is much better with the PPR." 
  Maluf believes the implementation of the URV [Real Value 
Unit] is merely a dollarization, adding that Finance Minister 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso should not resign to become a 
candidate. 
  "He should explain whether the plan was made for the 
election 
or for Brazil," said Maluf.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso </F>
by unidentified TV Manchete and TV GLOBO reporters "at the door 
of his house" in Brasilia on 11 March] 
  [Text] [TV Manchete] Is Minas Gerais Governor Helio Garcia 
a good candidate for vice president on the PSDB [Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party] ticket? 
  [Cardoso] Helio Garcia is certainly a good candidate, even 
for president. I would like to reiterate that I saw today's 
newspaper headlines reporting decisions that are not mine, and 
information that I did not give to my party. The subject cannot 
be managed the way it is being managed, reporting that I decided 
this or that. Reports are somehow speculating over the 
advantages or the desires of interlocutors. In addition to its 
political nature, this is a very personal matter, of a family 
nature. This type of matter must be discussed with one's own 
closer relatives. It is not a matter to be treated in terms of 
he-said-that-he-said. I have not made any decision, and there 
is no reason for it. I will continue to work. I spent the 
morning with Central Bank President Pedro Malan, with whom I 
discussed the instructions he is taking to the United States for 
negotiating the foreign debt. Brazil has already rejoined the 
international financial community. The finance minister should 
thus not be worn out by reports by saying that he is candidate 
for this, or for that. 
  [TV Globo] The newspaper headlines saying that you have 
already informed President Itamar Franco of the day on which you 
will step down -- are they inaccurate? 
  [Cardoso] I have not discussed a resignation day with 
anyone, 
not even with the PSDB. To the contrary, what I told the PSDB 
is that I can accept no conditions for a positive outcome. Any 
decision that I make will depend on a very impartial evaluation 
of what is best, first for the country, and then for me. This 
should be the procedure. I did not inform any party of this. I 
have only reported on my own difficulties, and I am saying this 
with total sincerity. Everyone knows that the PSDB wants me to 
be the candidate. I therefore need no manipulation in this 
regard. But I cannot say or do this or that if I am not certain 
that it will be positive for Brazil and for me. 
  [TV GLOBO] Would your resignation make the economic plan 
unfeasible? 
  [Cardoso] I don't believe so. It would be too pretentious of 
me. Yet I have the responsibility of verifying the effects that 
a decision to step down or to stay would have on the plan. The 
matter needs this elbow room. It also involves discussions 
within my intimate circle. I have a very good team, and I 
cannot just say "Ah, the minister has changed his mind." That 
is not my style. Through you I tell the country that this is a 
distressing decision. It is useless to speculate, because 
speculation is simply groundless. We are very far from the 
elections. The minister is not harming anyone. The minister is 
interested in other issues. The decision that I can make must be 
very carefully evaluated. I will not be driven by purely 
personal or partisan reasons. 
  [TV Manchete] PSDB President Tasso Jereissati has said that, 
if necessary, he will go to the ministry to pull you out of your 
chair. What is your reaction to this remark? 
  [Cardoso] The nails that are holding me there are very 
strong 
(laughs).

<F P=106> [Report by Joao Domingos in Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] A council of notables, which will be coordinated by 
former Deputy Plinio de Arruda Sampaio, will steer the political 
course of the presidential campaign of PT [Workers Party] 
candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. This council will also 
seek to isolate radical PT members. Invitations are now being 
extended to those who will serve on the council, which will 
start meeting already this month. It will be incumbent upon the 
council to evaluate -- from the standpoint of society, not of 
party members -- the advertising and political content of Lula's 
speeches. 
  Serving on this council will be people who are linked to the 
political history of each region. Its members do not have to be 
members of the party. In practice, the council will assume 
powers that are currently exercised by some radical members of 
the PT executive board, such as state Deputy Rui Falcao of Sao 
Paulo State. Falcao, Luis Eduardo Greenhalgh, and Gilberto 
Carvalho will join the PT leadership that will run the daily 
campaign. They will thus not have time to undertake any form of 
political analysis. 
  Falcao is one of the leading adversaries of the PT bloc in 
Congress, which consists primarily of moderate members. Falcao 
is frontally opposed to PT participation in the constitutional 
revision process, and has become known for his political 
intransigence. Arruda Sampaio said: "I cannot understand why 
the PT expelled the Socialist Convergence faction from its 
cadres, because Rui Falcao alone is far more Shiite than the 
entire faction." Like Workers Cause, another radical Trotskyite 
faction, Socialist Convergence has been proscribed within the PT. 
  The idea of creating a council of notables stemmed from the 
acknowledgement of the errors committed in the 1989 presidential 
campaign -- when Lula was defeated by Fernando Collor -- and 
from the fear that the "Shiites" may manage to control the PT 
campaign for the 3 October election. In 1989, the PT campaign 
managers had serious problems with regional party boards which 
were trying to influence the election and the use of free 
electoral advertising.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The constituent Congress yesterday 
rejected the recommendation of Rapporteur Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS) 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party -- Rio Grande do Sul] to 
abolish the posts of vice president, vice governor, and vice 
mayor. Of the 416 congressmen who were present at the session, 
328 of them voted against this recommendation and 84 voted in 
favor, while four others abstained from voting. 
  Congress approved, in a second round of voting, an amendment 
that allows Brazilians to have dual nationality, thus modifying 
article 12 of the 1988 Constitution. Deputy Jobim believes this 
amendment "modernizes" the law. The measure abolishes the 
bureaucratic requirements to recognize the Brazilian nationality 
of those who are born abroad of Brazilian fathers and mothers. 
  The amendment made three changes to the original text, 
Chapter 3 of the Constitution, about nationality. The first 
change is that it is no longer necessary to register a child 
born abroad from a Brazilian father and mother in a Brazilian 
consulate or embassy in order to later obtain Brazilian 
nationality. 
  The other change was to reduce from 30 to 15 years the time 
of residence in Brazil required by a foreigner to obtain 
Brazilian nationality. Another change was in the provision that 
regulates the loss of Brazilian nationality. The amendment 
approved yesterday allows Brazilians to obtain another 
nationality when "the foreign law acknowledges the original 
nationality of the individual" and when "a foreign country 
imposes the naturalization of the individual as a condition to 
continue living in its territory or to exert his civilian 
rights."

Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE), and of 
Alkimar Moura as head of monetary policy of the Central Bank. 
Coutinho obtained 46 votes, with three votes against him and

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 12 Mar (DPA) -- Colombian 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff today confirmed the 
surrender of Julio Fabio Urdinola, a leader of the Cali cocaine 
cartel, in Palmira, a city in western Colombia. 
  Prosecutor General De Greiff told the privately owned 
"Caracol" radio station in Santa Fe de Bogota that 27-year-old 
Urdinola is charged with drug trafficking, illegal enrichment, 
and conspiracy. 
  De Greiff said Urdinola was accompanied by one person, not 
two as was reported earlier. The prosecutor general said he did 
not know who Urdinola's companion was. 
  The prosecutor general added that Urdinola's lawyer said 
that 
the mafioso will confess to his crimes. De Greiff did not say 
where Urdinola is being held, but it is believed that he is at 
the Palmira maximum security prison. 
  The prosecutor general said he has no information regarding 
the imminent surrender of Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, alleged 
head of the Cali cartel, whose lawyers have been discussing his 
surrender with judicial authorities.

<F P=106> [Report by Sonia Rodriguez from "The Midday Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] Commenting on the surrender today of Julio Fabio 
Urdinola Grajales, a man described by Colombian and U.S. 
intelligence corps as a prominent figure in the Cali Cartel, 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff said it did not involve any 
concessions or special negotiations. 
  [Begin de Greiff recording] [Word indistinct] this man's 
surrender. He came forth and said he surrendered. The Attorney 
General's Office participated in this process, which is 
appropriate and in accordance with the law. Urdinola said he 
wanted to surrender, and the processes involved in the 
Prosecutor General's charges against him will continue. In his 
confession, Urdinola said he will calmly and seriously follow 
legal procedures without anything unusual, as it must be in a 
civilized society. [end recording] 
  Urdinola Grajales is facing three charges within the 
Colombian legal system. Prosecutor de Greiff explained: 
  [Begin recording] [de Greiff] Drug trafficking, illegal 
enrichment, and conspiracy. 
  [Rodriguez] With the surrender of Urdinola Grajales, do you 
expect Cali Cartel members to surrender en masse? Who is Jesus 
Ancizar Porras, who also surrendered today? 
  [De Greiff] I have no idea. Nor do I have any idea if Mr. 
Urdinola belongs to a cartel. That is part of the 
investigation. General Octavio Vargas, director of the National 
Police, told me that Mr. Urdinola was accompanied by a man named 
Jesus Ancizar Porras. My office has no information regarding 
the latter's activities; that is, illegal activities. The 
prosecutor handling the case may provide you with more 
information, but with the restraint the case warrants. 
  [Rodriguez] Recently there have been many contradictory 
views 
about the way you are implementing the surrender policy [five- 
second break in reception] how do you feel about it? 
  [De Greiff] The country must remember that I do not have 
sovereign power to implement those provisions because they are 
dictated by law. The accord was approved by judges and the 
National Court. 
  [Rodriguez] Do you know if the government assured Urdinola 
he 
will remain in Palmira Prison? 
  [De Greiff] As far as I know -- of course this has just 
happened -- there was no agreement or conditions for the 
surrender of those men. 
  [Rodriguez] Do you think this surrender will end the 
opposing 
views that have been expressed recently in the government? 
  [De Greiff] I think we must set aside the hysteria of this 
past week on differences between the government and the 
Prosecutor General's Office and continue ahead with a policy 
that can -- and I stress can -- be successful. 
  [Rodriguez] Why do you think the government is not allowing 
Pablo Escobar's five bodyguards to be moved to Itagui Prison? 
  [De Greiff] What do I think about it? I do not think the 
problem of guarding 25, 25 [repeats himself] criminals or less 
is something that cannot be controlled and solved. We would be 
extremely inefficient [words indistinct] if we could not control 
25 criminals. [end recording] 
  Regarding the counts of drug trafficking, illegal 
enrichment, 
and conspiracy Urdinola is facing, I must tell you that a few 
days ago the U.S. Justice Department forwarded evidence against 
Urdinola and (Hernado Angel Garnet) to the Deputy Prosecutor's 
Office.

<F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez Diaz by </F>
unidentified Caracol announcer in Santa Fe de Bogota on 12 March 
-- live] 
  [Text] [Announcer] What is the government's position on the 
surrender of Valle del Cauca drug traffickers, which began today 
with the surrender of Julio Fabio Urdinola Grajales? 
  [Gonzalez] I think this is an important event in the fight 
against drug trafficking and a positive event in the struggle 
against crime. It conveys the idea that criminals are better 
off surrendering to justice rather than succumbing to the 
state's firm actions. To the extent that this process advances 
within the framework of effective cooperation so justice can be 
done, we believe it will help strengthen the country's judicial 
organization. 
  [Announcer] Is the government certain that drug traffickers 
who surrender will confess their crimes and cooperate with 
justice? 
  [Gonzalez] According to reports from the Prosecutor 
General's 
Office, we understand there is a willingness on the part of drug 
traffickers to cooperate with authorities and confess their 
crimes. Obviously, this will have to be evaluated and judged by 
the Prosecutor General's Office and judicial authorities. 
However, we do have reports on the drug traffickers' 
willingness to cooperate. They surrendered to authorities 
unconditionally. Let's wait for an evaluation from the 
Prosecutor General's Office and for the process to conclude. 
  [Announcer] Is the Palmira Prison a maximum security prison? 
Does it guarantee that these people will be safe there? 
  [Gonzalez] Once we received the information from the 
Prosecutor General's Office on the surrender of these 
individuals, we set aside a place within Palmira Prison and took 
special security measures. They will be submitted to an ordinary 
disciplinary regime, as well as to special security measures. 
  Once the projects for a security section within Palmira 
Prison are complete, they will be transferred to those 
installations. 
  [Announcer] Does the government know anything about other 
people surrendering? 
  [Gonzalez] No. There are no reports of other drug 
traffickers surrendering to justice. As the public knows, this 
surrender is part of a process of conversations and requests 
that has been under way for several months now under the 
direction of the Prosecutor General's Office. 
  [Announcer] We thank Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez Diaz. 
He just gave the government's official position on the surrender 
of Julio Fabio Urdinola Grajales.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Attorney General Carlos Gustavo </F>
Arrieta by "NTC News" anchorman Felix de Bedout -- live] 
  [Text] [de Bedout] For the past few weeks it has been 
obvious that you, the government, and the prosecutor general 
have grown apart. A few hours ago you said that the way this 
process has been handled could lead to impunity. Do you feel 
the same way after today's surrender? 
  [Arrieta] I think a couple of things need to be cleared up. 
There have been differences, which the people heard about. I 
have questioned some decisions because I think these matters 
must be handled within a process, respecting the rights and 
duties of each entity. I do not believe the government, the 
Prosecutor General's Office, or the Attorney General's Office 
have grown apart. We have had our differences. I think that 
what happened today is the best proof that if we cooperate with 
one another, as we did in [Julio Fabio] Urdinola's case, this 
process can work. The truth is that Urdinola's surrender was an 
announced surrender. For quite some time now there has been 
talk of a surrender. I do not think there are any differences 
between the government, the prosecutor general, and the attorney 
general on this. 
  [De Bedout] But the problem of impunity continues. Do you 
think the way things are being handled could result in impunity? 
  [Arrieta] I have said repeatedly that because our Penal Code 
is a confusing, profuse, and diffuse code, it could lead to 
impunity. I have also said that the best way to prevent this is 
for all the institutions that must work with the law to agree on 
how we should make it work. In other words, the prosecutor 
general would do his job, the government its job, and the 
attorney general would orchestrate the whole procedure and see 
that no one goes unpunished. If we can achieve this, even though 
the Penal Code is confusing, profuse, and diffuse, I think we 
can give the country a balanced and appropriate answer. 
  [De Bedout] Attorney General Arrieta, one subject that led 
to 
differences between the government and the prosecutor general 
was the transfer of certain Medellin Cartel members to a jail in 
Medellin. Do you think that transfer should be made? 
  [Arrieta] I cannot express my opinion on that matter. 
Depending on what happens, the Attorney General's Office may 
have to become involved in this matter, and if I expressed my 
opinion now, I would have to declare myself ineligible to rule 
on this matter. I would like to say that the law is clear. The 
law clearly establishes the duties of the prosecutor general and 
the government, and we are responsible for ensuring that none of 
the two institutions oversteps its authority in order to ensure 
that the law is respected, not just in this particular case but 
in all cases that are controlled and supervised by the Attorney 
General's Office. 
  [De Bedout] Thank you, Attorney General Arrieta.

<F P=106> [From the "TV Today" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Colombian Government welcomed gladly today the 
report that two additional alleged Valle del Cauca drug 
traffickers had surrendered. They are Julio Fabio Urdinola 
Grajales, brother of Ivan Urdinola Grajales, and Jesus Ancizar 
Porras, who were interned at Palmira Prison, Valle del Cauca 
Department, where they will negotiate their penalties with the 
Prosecutor General's Office. 
  Urdinola Grajales arrived with his defense counsels and 
immediately was received by Regional Prosecutor Francisco Javier 
Hernandez and Palmira Prison Director Marco Antonio de Moya. 
During the legal proceedings after undergoing a medical 
checkup, Urdinola Grajales confessed to his participation in 
drug-trafficking activities. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Will the police or 
Army be in charge of security? 
  [Captain Raul Benavides, Valle del Cauca police commander] 
It 
is the prison director's duty; we will back him up, however. 
[end recording] 
  Ancizar Porras arrived with Urdinola Grajales and confessed 
to his participation in crimes related to manslaughter. 
  [Begin recording] [Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez Diaz] 
This is an important and interesting event in the country's 
struggle against drug trafficking and organized crime; in 
addition, it underlines the fact it is more intelligent to 
surrender to the authorities than to perish as the result of the 
state's unceasing and determined actions. 
  [Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff] This is the result of 
a process in which the administration of justice, the 
government, and the police have cooperated. All of this has led 
to this surrender, and I hope it will also lead to other 
surrenders. [end recording] 
  Both Urdinola Grajales and Ancizar Porras will be held at 
Palmira Prison, where they will negotiate with the Prosecutor 
General's Office a quick end to the process they initiated with 
their surrender today.

<F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Ayala from the "24 Hours Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] Today, the Attorney General's Office insisted on 
relocating five Medellin Cartel members from Santa Fe de Bogota 
to Itagui. The government, however, through Justice Minister 
Andres Gonzalez, continues to resist this transfer. Today, the 
Attorney General's Office said its Medellin representative was 
who requested the transfer of the five people charged with being 
lieutenants of the late drug trafficker Pablo Escobar Gaviria. 
  A communique issued today by the Attorney General's Office 
states that, based on Article 35 of the Penal Procedures Code, 
the Medellin Cartel members must be accessible to the prosecutor 
in charge of their case, thereby allowing preliminary meetings 
and agreements. The government thinks differently however. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] Regarding their transfer, I have 
stated that, in our opinion, it is not advisable to gather the 
remaining Medellin Cartel members in the same place. [end

  [Text] Luis Hernando Correa Isaza, a key official in the 
surrender of several Medellin Cartel members to the authorities, 
was murdered by paid assassins in Calasanz neighborhood, 
northern Medellin, at approximately 1030 yesterday. Correa 
Isaza was the regional director of the Antioquia Prosecutor's 
Office technical corps. The assassins were traveling in a white 
Renault 9 and fled the scene after killing Correa Isaza. So 
far, authorities have been unable to locate the perpetrators. 
  Correa Isaza was traveling in a gray Renault 18 when several 
men attacked his car near a building at No. 82-24, 49B Street 
and shot him several times. The Antioquia Prosecutor's Office 
official was immediately taken to Pablo Tobon Uribe hospital in 
Medellin, where he died in the emergency room a few minutes 
later. Correa Isaza's driver was also seriously injured in the 
attack. Correa Isaza was reportedly going to look for his 
girlfriend when he was attacked. 
  Luis Fernando Correa, a 34-year-old lawyer who graduated 
from 
Medellin University, was a key government figure in obtaining 
the surrender of several criminals and implementing the witness 
protection program. He was widely known in legal circles for 
helping get Nicolas Escobar Urquijo, nephew of Medellin Cartel 
drug lord Pablo Escobar Gaviria, out of the country, and for 
helping transfer Escobar Gaviria's relatives to Santa Fe de 
Bogota. Moreover, Correa Isaza was conducting important 
investigations of people accused of belonging to the Medellin 
Cartel. 
  According to witnesses, Correa was shot by a young, stocky 
man dressed in blue who was picked up a few seconds later by a 
white Renault 9. It is therefore suspected that more people are 
involved in the crime. 
  Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff said he regretted the 
incident and although the reason for the crime and the 
perpetrators are still unknown, Correa Isaza was involved in 
many delicate investigations that could have prompted the 
murder. The ranking judicial official said the regional 
director of Antioquia Prosecutor's Office technical corps was a 
brave man who took too many risks because, despite his delicate 
position, he liked to move about the city alone or only with his 
driver. 
  Ivan Felipe Palacios, secretary of the departmental 
government, said "one cannot understand how such things happen 
to people who are only honestly and positively working in favor 
of justice and the country." He asked the Prosecutor General's 
Office to begin immediately an investigation of the crime, 
because "we cannot progress without finding the real culprits." 
He asserted: I am going to be very conscious of everything 
related to this case because it is very painful for justice and 
for the people of Antioquia." 
  During one of Correa Isaza's latest operations, 70 kg of 
dynamite were seized from the estate of the father of late 
Medellin Cartel member Alfonso Leon Puerta Munoz, alias "El 
Angelito."

  [Text] This is the first reaction to the results of the 
Liberal Party internal primary. This result, which the Caracol 
Network has predicted, coincides with figures provided by the 
National Advisory Center after an opinion poll was taken among 
35,000 people. 
  Humberto de la Calle Lombana, with a remarkable improvement, 
received 14.77 percent of the vote. Ernesto Samper Pizano, 
56.75 percent. This result has not accounted for blank votes; 
had these been considered, de la Calle would have received 14 
percent versus Samper Pizano's 53.8 percent. 
  [Begin recording] [Announcer Dario Arizmendi] Dr. de la 
Calle, good afternoon. 
  [De la Calle] Good afternoon, Dario; glad to greet you. 
  [Arizmendi] Same to you. Congratulations for the result, 
which is considerably higher than that predicted by the week's 
earlier opinion polls. 
  [De la Calle] Undoubtedly. I am happy and want to tell you 
this is a good result. I have been in public life for only one 
year and think this has been a success, particularly for 
independent voters. I will write soon a paper that I intend to 
send to Dr. Samper accepting his victory and saying it was a 
clean and democratic victory. I will add, however, we are 
undoubtedly the second largest liberal force, that we will be 
present in 1998, that in that year I expect to take my ideas of 
constitutional development, renewal, and change to the 
Presidency, and that the message for me is one of optimism, 
gladness, and recognition of the people who have believed in our 
political proposals. 
  [Arizmendi] Considering this high percentage of votes in the 
second round, as you said, the fact that you have been in 
political work for barely one year and [words indistinct], what 
do you expect in the new liberal organization that Samper Pizano 
had announced previously? Do you think you can rightfully claim 
the chance to run for the position of vice president of the 
Republic? 
  [De la Calle] As I have said many, many times, I have ruled 
out the possibility of running for vice president. I am sure I 
must keep after ideals; this is based on principles, ideas, and 
the renewal process I helped push forward in 1991. 
  I will keep on working. I thank my voters; they can rest 
assured I will run for president in 1998. Meanwhile, all I want 
is to recognize Samper Pizano's triumph. All of us liberals 
should sit down and make a sustained effort to update the party, 
to push it forward, and to strengthen the liberal platform with 
the various political inclinations expressed today. 
  My immediate invitation is for Dr. Samper to study these 
various shades of liberalism, to create a platform incorporating 
all of them despite their differences, admitting opinion polls 
have been useful, that there is a process to reinforce the 
Liberal Party's unity. This unity, as I have said many times, is 
programmatic rather than arithmetical. I am open to discuss 
programs and platforms to consolidate a triumphant Liberal Party 
program. 
  [Arizmendi] Do you intend to work with the same fervor and 
zest as before, now that you have attained the second highest 
percentage of votes in the Liberal Party? 
  [De la Calle] I intend to sit down soon with Dr. Samper to 
discuss this new and revived Liberal Party program, which must 
include and revolve around renewal, change, participative 
democracy, and social policy. I think the moment demands a 
programmatic and ideological process of discussion, which should 
be the true basis for a true Liberal Party unity. I recognize 
his victory, but I think it is necessary to go one step beyond 
the figures. In a few minutes, I will invite Dr. Samper to make 
this programmatic effort to unify liberalism in depth where the 
unity is genuine; that is, ideas. 
  [Arizmendi] Very clearly, Dr. de la Calle has admitted Dr. 
Samper's victory and announced he will address a note to him in 
a few hours. De la Calle expects to meet with Dr. Samper in a 
few days to discuss the Liberal Party's future. De la Calle 
also announced he will run for president in 1998 and that he 
would never run for vice president on a single ballot with 
Samper, who came out a clear winner in the Liberal Party primary. 
  Carlos Lleras de la Fuente expresses his opinion on this 
result. He only participated in the campaign for three weeks but 
received 7.8 percent of the vote, without accounting for blanks, 
and 8.22 percent considering blank votes, after the primary was 
held with 35,862 interviews conducted by the National Advisory 
Center. Dr. LLeras de la Fuente, good afternoon and welcome to 
the Caracol Network. 
  [Lleras] Good afternoon; how are you all? 
  [Arizmendi] Very well, Sir. Are you happy and satisfied? 
Did the result take you by surprise? 
  [Lleras] I am very happy. Although the campaign lasted 
barely 20 days, I received 8.22 percent of the overall vote; 
this is more than a success, a success which I believe has never 
been seen before in Colombian elections. 
  [Arizmendi] Did you expect a percentage this high? 
  [Lleras] I have always been optimistic; so I expected to 
obtain very good results. The figures confirm the people 
responded to the call to vote according to their consciences. 
  [Arizmendi] With this result in mind, do you intend to run 
for the 1998 elections, as de la Calle just announced? Or will 
you initiate some political exercises of a spiritual nature 
before making any decision? 
  [Lleras] I think you still remember my spiritual exercises 
in 
parks. Beginning tomorrow, I will do spiritual exercises until 
the Liberal Party convention, when I will make a final decision. 
This result is very encouraging for anything I may have in mind 
for the future. 
  [Arizmendi] Will you support Dr. Samper's presidential 
candidacy for now? 
  [Lleras] Of course. This is the pledge I made when I entered 
the Liberal Party primary. As I have always said, a gentleman's 
pledge must be complied with, regardless. 
  [Arizmendi] If Dr. Samper asks you, will you tell him your 
profile of the candidate for vice president? 
  [Lleras] I do not know what Dr. Samper will ask me. I talked 
with him last night. I intend to phone him in a while to 
congratulate him for his victory and reiterate something that 
had already been said by Dr. de la Calle and that I had already 
proposed. I am referring to the need to create a permanent 
ideological platform for the Liberal Party, not one created 
every time there are elections, rather, one that can be a guide 
for the next government and the party's future. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Aris Fogel; from the "TV Today" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Colombia can be satisfied. Once again it has 
demonstrated its democratic spirit. It showed the guerrillas at 
the polls that it wants peace. Amid a climate of calm, it 
elected the people who will make up the Senate and Chamber of 
Representatives in the new Congress. As for the Liberal 
primary, partial returns from the National Civil Registry Office 
indicate Ernesto Samper Pizano won. He referred to his victory, 
as follows: 
  [Begin Samper recording] I have received the message. I 
interpret the triumph in the primary as a mandate for social 
change. To achieve it, we must transform the Liberal Party so 
that it will again be a faithful interpreter of Liberal ideals. 
The party cannot continue to be a representative of old 
policies, which citizens want to change. [end recording] 
  Although Samper's presidential candidacy must be ratified 
and 
confirmed by the Liberals' 18 March convention, it is taken for 
granted he will receive his party's support. 
  For its part, the Conservative Party was pleased with the 
progress achieved in the parliamentary elections, as was stated 
by Conservative Party Director Cornelio Reyes. 
  [Begin Reyes recording] The exit poll results announced by 
Caracol indicate the Conservatives are getting more than eight 
Senate seats. It will have 10 new seats in the Chamber of 
Representatives. [end recording] 
  Andres Pastrana, presidential candidate and leader of the 
New 
Democratic Force, described today's elections, as follows: 
  [Begin Pastrana recording] It is a triumph of democracy over 
violence. I think this is very important, that the people went 
out to vote, despite the fact--we say sadly--we did not get the 
results we wanted. Abstentionism is still very high. I hope I 
can convoke the Colombians, as I intend to do, so that on 8 May 
we can defeat abstentionism in Colombia. [end recording]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 13 Mar (EFE) -- Ernesto Samper 
Pizano, who won the internal primary of the ruling Liberal Party 
to select the presidential candidate for the upcoming 8 May 
elections, appealed today for a "convergence to defend the 
excluded." 
  Samper Pizano, a 43-year-old Bogota attorney and economist, 
former financial leader, former senator, former minister, and 
former ambassador to Spain, won the ruling Liberal Party's 
"internal primary" and became the presidential candidate for the 
1994-98 term to replace President Cesar Gaviria. 
  "I am satisfied and happy with the results," Samper said, 
thanking those who voted for him in the primary, which was held 
simultaneously with the legislative elections. He said he is 
"committed with all Colombians of goodwill." 
  "Our challenge is to seek a new opportunity so the liberal 
ideas will continue to prevail to the benefit of all 
Colombians," Samper said. He vowed to return to the policy of 
credibility. If he wins in May he will head the third 
consecutive Liberal administration since 1986. 
  Ernesto Samper, whose victory will be affirmed on 18 March 
during his party's national convention, obtained 46 percent of 
the votes, beating Humberto de la Calle, Carlos Lleras de la 
Fuente, Carlos Lemos, Rodolfo Gonzalez, David Turbay, and Gloria 
Gaitan. 
  Samper urged his rivals to "set aside our differences to 
join 
in the common task of reuniting, renewing, and transforming the 
party, to achieve a rapprochement," not in exchange for 
bureaucratic posts, rather, through "basic understanding." 
  He also announced the economic opening carried out by 
current 
President Gaviria, under whom Samper was development minister 
and ambassador to Spain, must be complemented by creating more 
jobs and "improving many Colombians' standards of living." 
  "The people have spoken and have shown they still trust 
Liberalism, its principles and ideas, as the best way to govern 
Colombia," Samper said. He said the liberal majority elected in 
the Congress today "must be confirmed by a triumph in the 
presidential elections." 
  "The people of Colombia, as in other parts of Latin America, 
want a change of course. They want more job opportunities and 
better living conditions for their families," the Colombian 
candidate stated. 
  Although the 8 May presidential elections will have 10 
candidates from different parties, Samper and Conservative 
presidential hopeful Andres Pastrana are favorites and have 
registered a "technical tie," according to recent polls.

citizen to cast his vote. With his wife Ana Milena Munoz 
present, he produced a copy of his identification card and cast 
his vote for the Senate, Chamber of Representatives, and Liberal 
Party presidential candidate elections. The president ruled out 
a break in relations with Cuba in the wake of an alleged meeting 
of Colombian guerrillas on the Caribbean island: 
  [Begin Gaviria recording] It is obvious in international 
relations we cannot take action until facts are verified. [end 
recording] 
  The president termed as positive the surrender to justice of 
alleged drug trafficker Julio Fabio Urdinola. Gaviria said he 
hopes the Prosecutor General's Office and the Justice Ministry 
will smooth out their differences. 
  [Begin Gaviria recording, in progress] ...that we will be 
able to reach an agreement with the Prosecutor General's Office. 
[end recording] 
  President Gaviria will remain at Narino Palace with his 
minister to monitor the elections.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colombian National Registrar Luis Camilo </F>
Osorio by Jesus Garzon in Santa Fe de Bogota; from the "TV 
Today" newscast--live] 
  [Text] [Garzon] Good evening. It is now 2058, and we 
have a last-minute bulletin after 22.5 percent of the Liberal 
Party's internal votes and the Senate votes have been tallied. 
According to the latest figures from the National Civil 
Registry Office, 48.94 percent of the tables have been tallied 
throughout the country. Mr. Registrar, according to the 
National Civil Registry Office's figures, who has won the 
Liberal Party's elections? 
  [Osorio] Ernesto Samper leads with 43 percent, followed by 
Humberto de la Calle with 15 percent, and Carlos Lleras with 
7.42 percent. I want to warn this barely represents 42.5 
percent, meaning the situation may change in different regions 
of the country. 
  [Garzon] There is a low voter turnout and many null votes. 
Why? How can you explain this, Mr. Registrar? 
  [Osorio] Apparently some people did not know how to use the 
ballot, so they simply deposited it, believing they were thus 
voting for a given party when they should have marked a 
candidate. 
  [Garzon] Who has swept the votes for the Senate of the 
Republic so far? 
  [Osorio] Two candidates from Caldas lead right now, but I 
must warn you that Caldas is in second place. We have 100 
percent of the votes from Amazonas Department, and Caldas 
follows with 98 percent of the votes, so it is not strange for 
two candidates from Caldas-- Victor Renan Barco in first place 
and Omar Yepez Alzate in second-- to lead. 
  [Garzon] What is the situation regarding the Chamber of 
Representatives, Mr. Registrar? 
  [Osorio] Regarding the Chamber of Representatives, we have 
information about a 100-percent count in certain departments, 
and there are others where over 90 percent of the votes have 
been counted, meaning more than 10 departments. We are still 
gathering information, so we do not have a distribution by party 
and movement.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 13 Mar (DPA) -- The Colombian 
Government described today's legislative elections as a 
"success," stating the voting signified the triumph of peace and 
democracy over the violence perpetrated by those who sought to 
curtail citizens' rights. 
  According to Government (Interior) Minister Fabio Villegas, 
"the Colombian people's civic-mindedness triumphed in the face 
of a minority which, hopefully, has heard the majority's 
repudiation of their violent practices." 
  The official referred to in this regard the actions of 
communist guerrilla groups that in the past weeks increased 
attacks to sabotage the elections. 
  Villegas said the subversives perpetrated several attacks, 
which all the people repudiated. He referred to especially the 
kidnapping of 32 electoral authorities in the eastern Department 
of Santander, which caused the suspension of the elections in 
the small town of Carcasi. 
  A little more than 17 million people over 18 years of age 
were eligible to vote, but the small turnout at the polls, a 
habit of Colombians that this time increased due to intense 
rain, raises the fear of increased abstentionism. 
  There was a 45-percent abstentionism in the legislative 
elections held in 1990. This figure increased to 70 percent in 
1991 when a new Congress was elected, after the National 
Constituent Assembly, which promulgated another Constitution 
that year, promoted the dissolution of the legislative body. 
  The voters elected Ernesto Samper as the presidential 
candidate of the ruling Liberal Party, because, according to 
unofficial reports aired on radio networks, he obtained at least 
46.3 percent of the votes. 
  The Liberal Party elected its candidate in an internal 
"Popular Referendum" availing itself of the infrastructure of 
the elections. If the results are confirmed, as it is taken for 
granted, Samper will be the Liberal Party presidential candidate 
who will run against Conservative Party presidential hopeful 
Andres Pastrana in the May elections.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colombian Defense Minister Rafael Pardo </F>
Rueda by Diego Hernan Canal from the Defense Ministry in Santa 
Fe de Bogota; from the "NTC Newscast"--live] 
  [Text] Military forces have reported normalcy throughout 
the country at this time, though there have been certain 
incidents of public disorder in various places. For example, in 
San Juan de Rioseco, Cundinamarca Department, two FARC 
[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] members died during a 
clash; three other subversives died during clashes in (Matanza), 
Santander Department. 
  The president of the Barranca de Upia Council, Meta 
Department, was killed, and several buses were attacked in 
Barrancabermeja. The most complicated situation is still in 
Carcasi, where more than 30 people are still being held hostage. 
The guerrillas have not allowed the elections to start in 
(Santa Rita de Iro) and Condoto, Choco Department. 
  Voting officers have not yet shown up in Montecristo, Achi 
Municipality, Bolivar Department; their whereabouts are unknown. 
  Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda is here. Mr. Minister, 
despite these public disorder incidents, do you think the 
elections are taking place normally in the country? 
  [Pardo] You reported on actions directly related to public 
order; that is, on clashes with the subversives and criminal 
acts. They are unrelated to the electoral process. As for 
things concerning the electoral process, I could specifically 
mention the situation in Carcasi, where the voting officers were 
kidnapped on 12 March. Carcasi has three voting tables and a 
little more than 1,000 registered identification cards. A small 
armed group has tried to prevent the people from voting in 
Condoto, which has fewer than three voting tables. In 
Montecristo, a corregimiento of Achi, Bolivar Department, the 
voting officers failed to show up at 0800 to comply with their 
duty and start the voting; that is, there are problems at less 
than 10 voting tables out of 45,000 or a little more than 45,000 
voting tables. 
  [Canal] Could we assume the voting officers in Montecristo 
were also kidnapped? 
  [Pardo] We have no information in this regard.

  [Text] The guerrillas have tried in vain to thwart the 
democratic determination of hundreds of Colombians in an 
extensive area of Santander Department. The Efrain Pabon Front 
of the ELN [Army of National Liberation] kidnapped 31 [number as 
heard] delegates and voting officers in Carcasi, (Garcia 
Rovira). Meanwhile, efficient operations by the authorities have 
allowed voting to take place normally in the area. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] The delegates and officers were 
traveling in five vehicles when they were intercepted by an ELN 
front in Carcasi Municipality, eastern Santander Department. 
The subversives are holding seven National Civil Registry 
Office delegates and 25 students who were going to (Toboson) to 
serve as voting officers. The guerrillas freed the driver of 
one vehicle, who subsequently informed the authorities. 
  [Second Division Commander Manuel Bonnet; identified by 
caption] We have been helping the National Civil Registry 
Office and the Governor's Office since this morning. We have 
the material here at the brigade and are ready to transport it 
via helicopter. The troops are also ready to ensure that the 
elections are held in those areas. 
  [Reporter] The kidnapping occurred on the afternoon of 12 
March, and by that evening the National Civil Registry Office 
had dispatched new delegates to see that elections would be held 
in the place where the subversive incursion occurred. The 
military forces said the elections are progressing normally in 
that zone. [end recording]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 13 Mar (DPA) -- Thirty-two 
electoral authorities who were kidnapped by guerrillas before 
today's congressional elections in Colombia were released 
tonight (local time) in the eastern Department of Santander, 
according to press sources. 
  Members of the pro-Cuban Army of National Liberation (ELN) 
perpetrated the mass kidnapping. This action prevented the 
holding of elections in the small town of Carcasi. 
  The rebels intercepted a bus and took seven members of the 
National Civil Registry Office, which organized the elections, 
and 25 students who were going to act as voting officers in that 
locality, to an unknown destination. 
  During the past month, groups linked to the Simon Bolivar 
Guerrilla Coordinating Board (CGSB) intensified their attacks to 
sabotage the legislative elections, although the government said 
today those attempts failed. 
  In addition to kidnapping electoral authorities, the CGSB 
also kidnapped three government officials in Cesar Department, 
blew up a stretch of the country's main oil pipeline, attacked 
intermunicipal buses, and activated medium-intensity bombs that 
did not cause any victims. 
  Colombians renewed today 102 Senate seats and 163 in the 
Chamber of Representatives (deputies) and elected Ernesto Samper 
as presidential candidate for the Liberal Party, which used the 
opportunity to hold an internal "popular primary."

<F P=106> [Speech by President Rafael Caldera at ceremony to sign </F>
emergency banking law in Caracas -- live] 
  [Text] Mr. President of Congress; Mr. President of the 
Chamber of Deputies; Messrs. Senators, Deputies, Ministers, and 
representatives of public power; and civilian society: 
  I will just say a few words to state that we have decided to 
promulgate without delay the emergency law that Congress has 
issued so that the special measures contained in the law can be 
adopted immediately and the situation of Banco Latino and the 
financial system in general can be addressed. 
  I think that in this case, we have had the first experience 
of what we call the commitment to solidarity. All the public 
power institutions have contributed to the effort to face this 
delicate, difficult, and complex situation. The private sector 
has also expressed, in different ways, its willingness to 
cooperate so that solutions can be undertaken to the 
satisfaction of a large number of Venezuelans and foreign 
residents in the country who have seen their economic situation 
gravely jeopardized by the events that have taken place. 
  After promulgating the emergency law, the national 
government 
plans to immediately present to the legislative chambers a bill 
with a brief partial reform of the published document because it 
considers that some of the approved provisions, due to the 
justified brevity of time because of the praiseworthy urgency 
with which Congress worked on the law...[pauses] perhaps there 
was not sufficient thought about the consequences that some of 
the norms might have and which, far from helping, might hinder 
the objective of achieving the reorganization of the Venezuelan 
financial system, which is an objective that concerns all of us. 
The law that I just signed has this double objective: on the 
one hand to address the emergency situation, the special 
situation created by the Banco Latino crisis, and on the other 
to give the branches of government the definite possibility of 
favorably resolving the aspects that might create fear among the 
Venezuelan community and the difficulties for the operation of 
the financial system. 
  I am sure that the same climate of dialogue and cooperation 
among the branches of government, which has prevailed in the 
passage of this law, will also be present when the government 
proposals regarding this are received. 
  I think today's action brings hope to those who have watched 
their personal situation with anguish due to the Banco Latino 
crisis, which I have not hesitated to describe as a real 
disaster and whose dimension has exceeded everything that was 
initially thought when the government of President Ramon 
Velasquez decreed the intervention of that bank. 
  I thank those present here, especially the members of the 
legislative chambers and the members of the committees that have 
been involved in this issue. I thank them on behalf of 
Venezuelans because they have maintained an open-minded, 
understanding, and constructive position that undoubtedly leads 
us to have strong hope about the future of the country and which 
views with undeniable and appropriate concern the situation of 
the economy and the National Treasury. 
  Again, thank you, and I hope the Venezuelan people, who have 
been shaken by the recent events of Banco Latino will feel more 
secure and have more hope about the efforts that the public and 
private sectors are making to guarantee everyone their 
legitimate rights and to share the necessary sacrifice to 
resolve the situation. [applause]

<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano] </F>
  [Excerpts] According to an announcement by Gustavo Rossen, 
president of the Banco Latino intervention board, Banco Latino 
could resume operations in 24 days as result of the new 
Emergency Banking Law recently signed at the Miraflores 
Presidential Palace. This morning, the president signed the 
Banking Emergency Law, thereby approving a new legal framework 
aimed at providing financial assistance to all financial 
institutions confronting a liquidity crisis like the one 
plaguing Banco Latino. In signing the new law, President Rafael 
Caldera said it is a decision of solidarity toward thousands of 
Venezuelans affected by the Banco Latino crisis. [passage 
omitted] 
  Delegations representing the banking sector, the National 
Congress, and members of the intervention board were present at 
the signing ceremony. Congressional representatives explained 
some of the benefits the law offers. In addition, the president 
of the Venezuelan banking association said the law establishes a 
framework allowing for the renewal of confidence in the 
country's banking system. 
  [Begin recording] [Democratic Action Deputy Omar Barboza] 
Starting with 10 million or more bolivares, the intervention 
board will be able to limit the application of this index or 
rate in order to repay interest to deposit holders. One thing is 
the guarantee, which amounts to 4 million bolivares, and another 
is the possible limit in applying the consumer price index to 
determine interest. Starting at 10 million bolivares, the 
intervention board is free to apply the interest rates it 
believes to be most applicable to the bank's reorganization 
plans. 
  [National Banking Council President Jose Bouzas] This law 
establishes a framework that will allow solutions to the crisis 
the Venezuelan banking sector is going through to be found. As 
members of the banking sector, we seek to establish guidelines 
allowing the bank's reorganization and the adoption of adequate 
solutions to protect deposit holders thereby enabling them to 
recover all their savings. On the other hand, this law provide a 
legal reference to support and sustain the entire banking 
system, which is currently being assisted by FOGADE [Deposit 
Guarantee Fund]. In other words, if we can ensure joint actions 
between the public and private sector, basically from national 
private banks, I then believe we will be able to establish joint 
programs between the banking superintendency, the Venezuelan 
Central Bank, FOGADE, and national private banks. In addition, 
there will also be the possibility of helping Banco Latino's 
depositors, helping with the bank's reorganization, and in 
finding a solution to the banking system crisis. [end recording] 
  The Central Bank president, who was also present during the 
Emergency Banking Law signing ceremony, insisted this 
institution has carried out its duties according to the law, and 
she indicated that she has all necessary documents to support 
her statements. The documents will be given to the courts soon. 
  [Begin recording] [Central Bank President Ruth de Krivoy] 
Through out the process, the Central Bank of Venezuela has 
conducted itself strictly in accordance with the law, with 
absolute objectivity. The bank has also promoted immediate, 
timely solutions to all difficulties it experienced. The Central 
Bank has extensively explained its performance to the 
congressional commissions. We also intend to provide all 
necessary details requested by the courts relating to this 
institution's performance. In this respect, I can say that from 
an ethical as well as a banking and monetary policy point of 
view, the Central Bank of Venezuela has conducted itself in 
accordance with the law, and we are willing to prove it to 
whatever level may be necessary. [end recording] 
  Gustavo Rossen, president of the Banco Latino intervention 
board said there are some legal loopholes, which Congress will 
solve soon. At the same time he insisted that Banco Latino 
depositors can rest assured the bank will be bank rolled within 
a very short period. 
  [Being recording] [Rossen] The request we plan to make of 
deposit holders, when the reorganization plan is finally 
approved, is to have confidence that once Banco Latino has been 
bank rolled by the government, then it will once again be one of 
the most solid banks in the country. 
  Deposit holders should not be apprehensive about leaving 
their deposits in the bank because they will be entirely paid 
back. In addition, they are essential if Banco Latino is 
expected to be the type of bank its long time clients want it to 
be: successful, versatile, and a bank capable of providing good 
service to its clients. 
  [Pachano] You have already decided on the details of the 
reorganization plan? It has... 
  [Rossen, interrupting] Yes, we have. 
  [Pachano] Has the plan been presented to President Caldera? 
  [Rossen] No, there is no need to present it to the president 
because it is not up to him to decide. The reorganization plan 
will be presented to the Central Bank of Venezuela in accordance 
with the law, and also to FOGADE. 
  [Pachano] Is it going to be presented this afternoon? 
  [Rossen] This morning we presented it to the Central Bank 
and this afternoon we will present it to FOGADE. 
  [Pachano] Both institutions must approve the plan? 
  [Rossen] That is correct. 
  [Pachano] If they ... 
  [Rossen, interrupting] Because both institutions will 
provide 
the funds to implement the program. 
  [Pachano] If the plan is approved today, how soon will it be 
implemented? 
  [Rosses] The reopening or reorganization plan, whichever you 
prefer, will be implemented in approximately 24 days as of 
[words indistinct]. In his address to the nation, President 
Caldera spoke of 30 days. If I am not mistaken, six days have 
gone by since his address to the nation, therefore we still have 
24 days to reopen the bank. By reopen, we mean reorganize. [end 
recording] 
  Once the Banking Emergency Law signing ceremony concluded, 
Gustavo Rossen headed to the Central Bank of Venezuela to 
present details on the Banco Latino reorganization. During the 
afternoon hours, he will also meet with the FOGADE board of 
directors to explain the reorganization program. If the plan is 
approved, Banco Latino could resume operations in 24 days.

<F P=106> [Article by Ana Diaz] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The principal challenge to 
President Caldera and his economic team will be to prevent an 
increase in the rate of inflation and to protect the level of 
international financial reserves to prevent a further major 
devaluation, according to economist Gustavo Garcia of the 
Institute of Higher Education for Administration (IESA). 
Economic problems militate against the optimistic scenario of 
maintaining 1993's rhythm of inflation (an average rate of 46 
percent.) 
  Garcia believes that this government has inherited a 
profound 
economic and financial crisis, whose solution becomes more 
difficult because of the country's social problems and the 
restrictions that Caldera himself spoke of in his inaugural 
address (taxes, increase in the price of gasoline). The 
principal reason for the economic crisis is the budget deficit, 
which could reach from 5 to 8 percent of the gross domestic 
product (from 350 billion to 560 billion pesos, respectively). 
  The feasibility of maintaining an accord on prices 
(salaries, 
exchange rates, and prices of goods and services), mentioned by 
some members of the new government, seems unrealistic and 
improbable, according to Garcia. [passage omitted] 
  The new government will apply the VAT [Value Added Tax], 
although with another name, only to wholesalers and with a long 
list of exemptions, which Garcia believes, could contribute to 
higher levels of tax evasion. He warns of the grave error of 
falling into the temptation of using funds from the sale of the 
assets of privatized firms to cover the deficit. 
  The sale of shares in PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.] to 
pay off large amounts of the external debt is another 
possibility, which would also reduce the pressure of interest 
payments. Although this measure is impeccable from a financial 
point of view, it would be dangerous if not accompanied by a 
radical restructuring of government finances. 
  According to the IESA economist, the alternatives for 
financing the deficit are very restricted, because Venezuela's 
access to international financial markets is limited, especially 
when the macroeconomic situation is not sustainable. Economic 
instability would limit the funds that could be obtained from 
the multilateral organizations if there is no clear intention 
and specific plan to put government finances in order. 
  There are also serious restrictions on further increases in 
the domestic debt (new issues of letters of credit in bolivares) 
to finance part of the deficit, because it would mean 
substantial increases in interest rates. [passage omitted]

secretary general, unexpectedly met on Wednesday night with 
former Defense Minister Vice Admiral Radames Munoz Ledo. AD 
Secretary of Organization Lewis Perez Daboin also was present at 
the meeting. 
  Although it was said that the meeting was a social event to 
welcome Munoz Ledo, who recently returned from vacation in the 
United States, AD sources did not rule out the possibility that 
this meeting could be part of an AD internal stratagem to 
reorganize the party and recover some ground lost by the 
political organization. [passage omitted on background material] 
  In addition, reports that Munoz Ledo will seek support from 
the Pentagon for presumed coupist plans in Venezuela still 
circulate. Of course, AD leaders, including Alfaro Ucero, have 
denied those reports. Alfaro Ucero expressed his full support 
for Munoz Ledo, describing him as a democrat.

<F P=106> [Report by Ebis Romero] </F>
  [Text] Maracaibo, 8 Mar -- General Antonio Rojas Salazar, 
National Guard commander in Zulia Department who was slated to 
be transferred on 5 July, has been removed unexpectedly without 
both the usual change of command ceremonies and the presence of 
General Egberto Artuza Delgado, general commander of the Armed 
Forces of Cooperation [FAC], who preceded Rojas Salazar as head 
of the 3d Regional Command of the National Guard Garrison in 
Zulia. Rojas was to have been transferred on 5 July as a result 
of the FAC general's retirement. 
  It has been reported that the unexpected dismissal of the 
National Guard commander in Zulia is a reprisal for his repeated 
confiscations in the border area of Paraguachon of millions of 
bolivares and U.S. dollars smuggled from Colombia, money that 
could have been used in the alleged crime of legalization of 
capital or money laundering. 
  The National Guard seized 47 billion bolivares last year 
from 
Arab businessmen who were taking money to Maracaibo to exchange 
it for U.S. dollars and then transfer it abroad. The Eighth 
Preliminary Criminal Court, through Judge Mirtha Alvarez de 
Rios, issued an arrest warrant for the Arab businessmen on 
charges of smuggling money to Venezuela. 
  Authorities recently confiscated $400,000 and 2 million 
bolivares about to be smuggled into Venezuela, reportedly owned 
by businessman Roy Harn, of Aruba, and a purported personal 
friend of Commander Artuza Delgado. 
  In addition, $3,000 were confiscated at the border. This 
money, and the remainder of the confiscated money, was deposited 
in the Banco Central de Venezuela vaults in Maracaibo. 
  All of the confiscated money was deposited at Banco Central 
in the presence of Drug Prosecutor Alfonso Marquez Saavedra and 
Alix Boscan de Baptista, the 18th judge in charge of drugs.

  [Text] Merida, 8 Mar -- More student demonstrations took 
place here and transportation service continues to be at a 
standstill for the sixth consecutive day. To make things worse, 
demonstrators threw rocks at a police patrol vehicle after 
unsuccessfully trying to set fire to it. 
  During the morning there were protests in several parts of 
the city which later turned into riots. The police repelled the 
demonstrators with tear gas, while students wearing face masks 
threw rocks and other hard objects. 
  Near the junior high school in the northern section of the 
city, several groups attacked police patrol vehicle 181. After 
unsuccessfully trying to set fire to it, they stoned the 
vehicle. Several demonstrators were hurt. 
  Alejandro Zambrano, a student who was charged with burning a 
bus, was released. This was in response to the demands made by 
another student. Nevertheless, police still had to use tear gas 
to disperse the demonstrators. 
  Merida is without transportation for the sixth consecutive 
day. Transportation union leaders say they are unable to work 
due to the lack of security, as they find the government 
unwilling to come to their aid. 
<H5>  National Transportation Strike </H5>
  The National Transportation Federation called a 48-hour 
strike for Thursday and Friday, because the Ministry of 
Transportation and Communication has not responded to their 
demands. The demands include changing the preferential student 
fare to half price. The strike is nationwide. In the predawn 
hours the strike will be regional, which means there will be no 
transportation service in Merida or in the interior of the state. 
  Police sources reported that masked demonstrators looted a 
trailer truck loaded with cosmetics on Monday.

you have been appointed? 
  [Council members] I do. 
  [Caldera] If so, may God and the fatherland honor you; if 
not, may they hold you accountable. 
  [Unidentified announcer] Members will now sign the minutes. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Caldera] This will be the organization in charge of 
promoting and coordinating the various economic, political, 
cultural, ethnic, ecological, and other activities about which 
all Venezuelans should be concerned, as well as about the people 
who live in these most remote areas of our country. The 
National Border Council is not tasked with demarcation. Such 
matters are the concern of the Foreign Ministry, under the 
direction of the president of the Republic. They are, as I 
said, responsible for promoting, coordinating, and directing the 
various activities that deal with the human presence along our 
country's borders, the people's development in bordering towns. 
This is not simply a demographic and statistical effort but 
also entails a number of issues regarding the concept of 
sustainable development and the need to affirm national 
sovereignty all across the fatherland. 
  I must thank State Minister Pompeyo Marquez for having 
accepted this mission, perhaps the most important assignment I 
have entrusted upon him as a state minister. I must also thank 
the members who will accompany the state ministers as advisers 
on border issues. Among these people are Monsignor Ignacio 
Velasco, the Bishop of Ayacucho, who has extensive experience in 
such areas and who is a proven patriotic spirit; the mayors of 
Gran Sabana and Caroni Municipality, who represent the human 
presence in the region. They are a symbol of municipal 
participation, the basic nucleus of the political community in 
this effort that we intend to pursue vigorously. 
  The Venezuelan border is extensive and varied. Certain 
portions are highly populated, such as the border region between 
Venezuela's Tachira State and Norte Santander in Colombia; many 
other portions have been neglected, and certain portions are 
marked by geographical lines, others by the course of rivers and 
streams. 
  More than the limits or our sovereignty, certain areas 
frequently become corridors for incursions that are not always 
the most convenient for our countries. Many times these 
incursions bring disturbances, even crimes. This extensive 
border covers very different landscapes. From Piedra del Cocuy, 
where our border with Brazil begins, to Santa Elena de Uairen, 
the border separates two countries that have lived with their 
backs to each other for many years. Now they are seriously 
concerned with uniting their initiatives and coordinating their 
possibilities, to the benefit of the communities living on 
either side of the border. 
  There are, then, many problems regarding this issue, 
including our insular domains, which have often been neglected 
by geographers throughout history. The potential here is 
enormous, and the possibilities are many for the future economic 
and social development of the Venezuelan nation. 
  Promoting interest among Venezuelans to know, occupy, and 
defend their borders is a task that must not be delayed; this is 
why we have given this ceremony such special importance. In 
recalling the founding of this institution, which we are 
reactivating today, I feel obligated to mention a leading 
collaborator, an outstanding Venezuelan foreign minister whose 
name was Aristides Calvani. 
  Aristides Calvani, the foreign minister during my first 
administration, played a significantly important and admirable 
role in matters of state, with a passion for the fatherland and 
an overwhelming interest and desire to serve. At this time, as 
is just, I would like to express my recognition and gratitude to 
such a statesman. 
  I thank all those present here today for accompanying us. I 
hope your presence here is a demonstration of your commitment; 
it is, however, a reciprocal commitment. The government's 
commitment is to address seriously the problems facing the 
National Border Council. The commitment of all sectors and 
levels of the civilian and political community is not to look 
upon Venezuela's responsibility regarding its border regions 
with indifference. Border development problems are not only the 
government's responsibility; they are everyone's problem, just 
like so many other issues that frequently frustrate and annoy us 
so much. 
  To find a final solution, then, the government needs the 
constant help of all Venezuelans. I reaffirm my gratitude for 
those accompanying us today. I also reaffirm my conviction 
toward this and other essential issues, that are so often looked 
upon with little concern or interest, and that will make 
Venezuela recognize the need to present itself proud and aware 
of its possibilities toward the 21st century.

<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano for "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Council of Ministers approved during its daily 
session the reorganization of the Ministry of the Presidency 
Secretariat. The measure will save the executive branch 
approximately 205 million bolivares and is expected to save the 
nation 410 million bolivares. 
  Presidency Secretariat Minister Andres Caldera personally 
announced the decision, which proposes a reorganization of the 
ministry to make it a secretariat again. The ministry will 
reassign 14 organizations under its authority to other 
ministries. The goal is to set an example for the austerity and 
administrative efficiency policy announced by the government. 
  [Begin Presidency Secretariat Minister Andres Caldera 
recording] As for the internal reorganization, it is 
appropriate to mention first the modernization and 
simplification of the General Directorate for Management and 
Services; the creation of a presidential advisory office; the 
creation of a unit to follow up on presidential decisions, a 
duty ascribed to the Council of Ministers secretary within the 
presidency's private secretariat; the creation of a state 
advisory unit within the legal consultative office to render 
public services, such as the publication of decisions and the 
compilation of laws and decrees; and the strengthening of the 
internal auditing office by creating an oversight mechanism for 
the control of assets and services and for administrative 
investigations. [end recording] 
  Venezolana de Television [VTV], which is currently under the 
Ministry of the Presidency Secretariat, will be transferred to 
the Central Information Office [OCI]. OCI Chief Guillermo 
Alvarez Bajares announced the approval of a budget for the 
state-owned television channel. He also announced the cabinet's 
decision to annul Decree 3,081 creating the Channel 5 
Foundation. Alvarez Bajares explained that the executive branch 
is determined to fully support VTV, and a special study will be 
undertaken to decide Channel 5's future. 
  [Begin Alvarez recording] Whereas Decree 3,081 dated 22 July 
1993 and published in edition 35,269 of LA GACETA dated 6 August 
1993 authorized the presidents of CONAC [National Culture 
Council] and VTV to create the Channel 5 National Television 
Foundation with the Chamber of Deputies and through an 
organization established for that purpose; 
  Whereas the aforementioned foundation was created on 19 
November 1993 through a deed recorded by the Alternate Second 
Circuit Registry Office in Libertador Municipality, Federal 
District, under No. 15, Protocol 1, Volume 30, without taking 
into consideration the participation of VTV as ordered by the 
aforementioned decree; 
  Whereas VTV's infrastructure, technical equipment, and 
general working conditions are in a critical situation; 
  Whereas it is contrary to the austerity policy and the 
mentioned critical situation to grant the recently created 
Channel 5 National Television Foundation a budget of 500 million 
bolivares, the same amount assigned to VTV, which lacks the 
resources to provide efficient service; 
  Decrees: Article 1. Annul Decree 3,081 dated 22 July 1993 
and published in LA GACETA, the official newspaper of the 
Republic of Venezuela, in edition 35,269 dated 6 August 1993. 
  Proceed to dissolve the Channel 5 National Television 
Foundation created through a deed recorded by the Alternate 
Second Circuit Registry Office in Libertador Municipality, 
Federal District, on 16 November 1993 and under No. 15, Volume 
30, Protocol 1. 
  The minister of the Presidency Secretariat and the minister 
of state and chief of the OCI are responsible for implementing 
this decree. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Hernan Mena Cifuentes] </F>
  [Text] The bands that traffic in illegal aliens struck a 
new blow in the past few hours with the illegal entry at the 
international airport of Maiquetia of some 30-odd Chinese and 
Iraqi citizens, less than a week after the arrest of eight 
Indians, who also lacked the necessary visas. 
  The report, confirmed by authorized spokespersons of several 
state security organizations assigned to the airport, states 
that due to the rapid intervention of police intelligence and 
investigative services of the DIEX [Directorate of 
Identification and Alien Affairs], the band has been virtually 
destroyed. However, two of its members, who were identified as 
officials of Interpol and of Immigration, escaped when they were 
about to be arrested. 
  The first group of illegal aliens--six Iraqi 
citizens--arrived last Saturday, 5 February, on board an 
Alitalia flight from Rome and, after paying $18,000, were taken 
from the transit section to the outskirts of the airport, where 
an automobile awaited them that took them to Caracas. 
  On the following day, according to the source, 28 Chinese 
citizens, all illegal aliens, arrived on board a British Airways 
flight from London in transit to Cartagena. They were held at 
the airport and taken to the offices of DIEX, in the customs 
area. 
  Once inside the DIEX offices, there began a scramble among 
several employees of DIEX and Interpol over the division of the 
thousands of dollars that the Asians offered to pay so as not to 
be deported. 
  A dispute the following day, provoked by the alleged contact 
or abettor (naturalized Chinese) of the illegal Asians, who 
argued heatedly with a member of the band (a DIEX official known 
as "El Maracucho"), insisting that he not demand more money for 
the "service," sparked an investigation by DISIP [Directorate of 
Intelligence and Prevention Services], carried out by personnel 
of the Immigration Investigative Service in Maiquetia. 
  As a result of the investigation, two officials were about 
to 
be arrested who were suspected of being implicated but, 
presumably warned by their accomplices, they "disappeared" and 
are now fugitives. 
  As is widely known, the traffic in illegal aliens at 
Maiquetia is an old story, and many scandals have been uncovered 
that involved senior officials in the Immigration Service in 
this commerce in human beings. 
  Because of the activities of these bands of traffickers and 
mafia-like organizations that operate at Maiquetia, the DIEX 
offices at the airport have been investigated several times in 
recent years, which makes it probable that a similar 
investigation could take place, in an effort to destroy these 
organizations. 
  The entry of illegal aliens through Maiquetia is said to 
have 
produced millions in profits in U.S. currency for the groups 
that engage in this traffic. It is estimated that, between 
Arabs, Chinese, citizens of India and other countries, they have 
brought in thousands of people from various parts of the world.

  [Text] The Beijing government is quite interested in 
increasing economic relations with Venezuela, particularly in 
the trade of oil and metallurgical products, stated PRC Vice 
Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu in a meeting with journalists during 
his visit to the Foreign Ministry for the installation of the 
Chinese-Venezuelan Political Consultation Mechanism. 
  "The two economies complement each other quite well. Many 
Venezuelan products -- for example, oil, iron, steel, and 
aluminum -- are needed in the PRC, while some of our light 
industry products could find a good market in Venezuela," Liu 
has said. 
  In an effort to strengthen bilateral trade, both governments 
are seeking ways to sign new economic cooperation agreements 
that establish a legal framework for an economic exchange. 
  Within the framework of the consultation mechanism, the two 
parties have discussed issues of bilateral interest to 
strengthen Beijing-Caracas ties. They have also talked about 
the internal situation in both nations and mutual support at 
international organizations. 
  The meeting was attended by Deputy Foreign Minister Roy 
Chaderton, International Policies Director Demetrio Boersner, 
Vicente Vallenilla, international economy and cooperation 
director, as well as other high-ranking Foreign Ministry 
officials. The PRC delegation was led by Vice Foreign Minister 
Liu, Liu Guo Xing, director of Latin American Affairs at the PRC 
Foreign Ministry; and Huang Zhiliang, PRC ambassador to Caracas. 
  Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli received Liu at the 
Yellow House following the meeting.

<F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu Bonilla "delivered </F>
yesterday to the editorial offices of LA MANANA"] 
  [Excerpts] Foreign policy is inextricably intertwined with 
social trends and with everything that pertains to the 
harmonious functioning of an institutional structure. The 
Foreign Ministry is vested with the power of designing and 
furthering our country's insertion into the regional or world 
scene by applying the strategies it deems most appropriate. 
  Uruguay has been and is respected for its stance on foreign 
policy. It has developed a philosophy that is respectful of 
international law, and which endorses nonintervention, 
self-determination, and the peaceful settlement of 
controversies. This is the reason why Uruguay's stance is taken 
into account when important decisions have to be made, not only 
concerning specific matters in our region, but also concerning 
the entire community of nations. 
  That which at present best characterizes Uruguayan foreign 
policy is the strategy of concentric circles. For Uruguay, its 
geopolitical situation in the region takes precedence over 
everything else. The Western Hemisphere and Ibero-American 
relations come next on its list of priorities, and the rest of 
the world comes last. Indeed, our national identity is forged 
by the give and take of ideas with our neighboring countries, 
and from there we can project our image to the rest of the 
world. Uruguay has followed two different approaches in its 
foreign policy, stemming precisely from its strategic location: 
the meridian policy and the parallel policy. The latter 
referred to the unavoidable influence exerted by Argentina and 
Brazil on Uruguay's geopolitical situation. The meridian 
policy, on the contrary, has to do with the fact that Uruguay is 
located in a region where the River Plate Basin is of necessity 
a point of reference. Therefore, in light of its geographic 
location as the bridge country, the country with extensive 
grasslands, it plays a very significant role as an outlet, as a 
port for the shipping of products from the River Plate Basin 
made up of Paraguay, Bolivia, important regions of Brazil, and 
principally the Argentine Mesopotamia [Misiones, Corrientes, and 
Entre Rios Provinces]. This meridian policy entails devising a 
subregional policy that is mindful of and builds on the 
strategies followed by Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, and Bolivia. 
It is within this context that the country's policy on issues 
like the waterway, or the channels, is analyzed. It is against 
this backdrop that the conditions for being the outlet for the 
region's production -- which will enable Uruguay to strengthen 
its position at subregional and especially regional levels -- 
take shape. 
  The process of consolidating strategies that range from 
subregional to hemispheric, from Ibero-American to global, must 
be achieved with openness and professionalism. The Uruguayan 
outlook has thus gone beyond merely commercial considerations in 
deciding to join Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. This 
decision was well received by political parties, and was passed 
with unanimous approval in the Senate. 
  Uruguay's path toward integration was to a certain extent 
already predetermined. In fact, Uruguay's joining Mercosur was 
like a person jumping onto a moving bus. The alternatives 
Uruguay had, in CAUCE [Argentine-Uruguayan Agreement on Economic 
Cooperation] and PEC [Trade Expansion Protocol], would have been 
eliminated when the integration process between Brazil and 
Argentina concluded. Uruguay thus had no alternative but to 
join Mercosur in order to avoid losing all its alternatives, and 
to have a say in the many decisions to be made by this 
organization concerning both political and trade matters. 
  Within the framework of Mercosur, Uruguay's option is to 
gamble on the enlarging of the market so that trade between its 
members will be increased. The old import substitution model is 
no longer prevalent, and the globalization and opening of 
regional markets -- which is the outcome of similar domestic 
policies -- will benefit from the optimal use of comparative 
advantages and economies of scale. 
  This policy on integration is complemented by the idea of 
establishing low tariffs so as not "ghettoize" (confine) our 
trade to the region, but rather to use it as a tool to insert 
our country into an increasingly competitive world. 
  Whenever we define our position within GATT, or within the 
system of international cooperation, we not only stress the 
comparative advantages derived from a country's resources, such 
as beef, wool, or weather conditions, but also bear in mind the 
values added in manufacturing, specialization of human 
resources, the incorporation of technology, etc. This all leads 
one to conclude that no matter what their size or population, 
countries can be more competitive precisely on the basis of 
these variables. This subject of competitive advantages thus 
also points to our leanings in foreign policy and our position 
in the international community. 
  It should moreover be pointed out that foreign policy (which 
seeks to defend our markets and our positions) is necessarily 
linked to education by virtue of its ties with the productive 
sector, and also to the necessary political consensus that 
prevents policies from being erratically changed every five 
years, because of changes brought about as a result of electoral 
strategies. [passage omitted] 
  The current importance of negotiations in the Uruguay Round 
of the GATT trade talks can be assessed in terms of the 
different issues that are at stake on the negotiating table. 
  So much so that GATT's trade negotiations have reached a 
stalemate. They have bogged down precisely over a multilateral 
proposal for the solution to the trade problem put forward by 
GATT's director general who, aware of the difficulties and 
controversies between developing and industrial countries and 
among industrial countries themselves, made a multilateral 
proposal that envisaged certain concessions by all GATT member 
countries. It included the so-called access to agricultural 
markets, which is one of the most sensitive issues for our 
economies. This leads us in a way to acknowledge the 
instability with which we sometimes have to deal in the realm of 
international relations, and realize that trade policies like 
those within Mercosur, GATT, etc., occasionally involve economic 
and political questions that go beyond the daily political 
tug-of-war to which a country may be exposed. 
  The approach that we follow is then to focus first on the 
subregion, then the region, the hemisphere, and insertion into 
the world. This approach has new variables entailing new 
subjects. 
  Finally, it is necessary to bear in mind that Uruguayan 
foreign policy -- like many aspects of our country's 
institutional and social life -- needs to be professional. 
[passage omitted] 
  Each member of the foreign service is an official 
representing the leading multinational image of Uruguay, with 
branches and officials all over the world, making decisions and 
really keeping their fingers on the pulse. 
  We need to demonstrate institutionality and coherence, so 
that Uruguay's foreign policy is not simply a matter of soirees 
and red carpet treatments, but rather a policy that entails 
knocking at the doors of people who work, produce, export, and 
trade. A country of 3 million people that could well pass for a 
district of Sao Paulo or Buenos Aires, and not exactly one of 
the more wealthy ones, must be capable of taking good advantage 
of all these things with a competitive spirit and the desire for 
improvement. Within Mercosur, he who follows the wisest 
strategy is better structured, and he who develops his human 
resources or comparative advantages more appropriately will be 
able to double, triple, and even be the leader in the 
streamlining and modernization of the country's productive 
structure. This is indeed foreign policy, international policy, 
and geopolitical and commercial insertion.

  [Excerpt] Uruguayan Economy and Finance Minister Ignacio de 
Posadas confirmed on 23 February the main guidelines of the 
nation's economic policy. He added that the objective within 
public finances is to maintain a balanced budget and that the 
devaluation rate will not be changed. 
  De Posadas told the Viewpoints radio program, aired by 
Montevideo Radio El Espectador: "We want a zero deficit and I 
believe we will not miss it by much." 
  As far as prices are concerned, De Posadas stated: 
"Inflation 
has been falling, it will stand at 2 percent (...) in February. 
This means inflation is on its way down and I believe the trend 
will continue." 
  De Posadas added: "There are no plans to change the exchange 
rate guidelines" because "the economic program calls for 
maintaining the present devaluation rate." 
  De Posadas admitted that a recent review of economic targets 
with IMF experts "has led to upward and downward corrections," 
adding that General Taxation Department and Social Security Bank 
revenue expectations "had been very pessimistic, but reality is 
showing that revenues are much higher than our typically 
Uruguayan pessimism had led us to expect." 
  Asked about the trade deficit, he answered: "A trade deficit 
is not necessarily bad, just as a surplus is not necessarily 
good." 
  He said: "Traditional exports continue to grow, which is 
very 
important. Whenever one looks at national figures one must look 
at them as a whole. Uruguay is receiving a lot of capital which 
is not registered because of errors and omissions. This capital 
is used mainly for investment and consumption." 
  De Posadas added: "It would seem that the upward trend of 
the 
deficit changed in December, although one swallow does not make 
a summer." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Montevideo, 11 Mar (EFE) -- Official sources 
reported today that higher Uruguayan courts have confirmed the 
extradition request on Miguel Ibanez Oteiza, an alleged member 
of the ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty] Basque terrorist 
organization. 
  The Spanish courts submitted two requests for the 
extradition 
of Ibanez Oteiza. The lower and higher courts approved the 
first. 
  This approval corresponds to the second Spanish request, 
which mentions charges of involvement in an attack, while the 
first request -- which was also granted -- mentions murder 
charges. 
  Oteiza and 12 other Spanish citizens were arrested by the 
Uruguayan police, at the request of Spain, in May 1992 in 
Montevideo. The Spanish citizens, who had forged documents, 
were running a Basque restaurant known as "La Trainera." 
  Of the 13 detainees, the courts rapidly released five, 
against whom Spain did not submit extradition requests. 
  Of the eight whose extradition was requested, local courts 
released three in 1993, after rejecting the extradition request. 
They are Rosario Delgado Iriondo, Jesus Maria Iriondo, and Pedro 
Maria Lizarralde Izaguirre. 
  Uruguayan lower and higher courts granted the extradition of 
two: Jose Maria Goitia Unzurrunzaga and Miguel Ibanez Oteiza. 
  As for the three remaining Spaniards, Uruguayan lower courts 
rejected the extradition request on Juan Jose Urrutia Pia and 
Amaya Araquistain Unamuno. The decision was appealed before a 
higher court. 
  Uruguayan lower courts granted the extradition of the last 
Spaniard, Luis Maria Lizarralde Izaguirre, but his lawyer, 
Gustavo Puig, appealed the decision. 
  Consequently, the five Spaniards whose extradition had been 
either granted or which are awaiting an appellate court decision 
remain in Montevideo's central prison. 
  The case of the alleged ETA members has been well covered by 
the Uruguayan press, which today dedicated broad coverage to the 
matter because it coincides with the acceptance by the Spanish 
King and Queen of an official invitation to visit Uruguay. 
  The date for the visit, which follows an invitation by 
Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle, is unspecified despite 
announcements in Uruguay that it will be made in the third week 
of April. 
  According to various sources, the visit's indefinite 
postponement followed displeasure expressed by Spanish 
authorities on two occasions over the delay in the extradition 
of the two alleged ETA members -- Oteiza and Goitia -- who 
cannot further appeal their extradition. 
  Uruguayan executive branch sources consulted by EFE suggest 
that the problem is that the two have trials pending in Uruguay 
for using forged documents, which they were carrying when 
arrested. 
  Lawyer Puig has said the trials for these minor crimes have 
not begun, even though almost two years have passed since their 
arrest, and the delay can last another year. 
  Presidential spokesman Roberto Etcheverry told EFE: "The 
Uruguayan Constitution guarantees the independence of the 
branches of government. This regulation is fully respected, for 
which reason the executive branch cannot and should not 
intervene in the court decisions."

  [Text] Lima, 11 Mar (EFE) -- Despite the hard blows it has 
sustained since the arrest of its founder Abimael Guzman in 
1992, the Maoist Shining Path [SL] movement is still trying to 
reorganize and, above all, regain the strength it has lost in 
Lima. 
  This was established after Counterterrorism Directorate 
(DINCOTE) agents arrested 13 SL terrorists, among them two 
women, during a dragnet operation between 24 February and 7 
March. Information on this operation was disclosed a few hours 
ago. 
  According to the police, the arrested individuals belong to 
a 
recently created SL organization called "New Network" [Nueva 
Red] which apparently has replaced the "People's Aid" which, up 
to now, had been in charge of selective murders and of providing 
logistic support for SL attacks. 
  The police have also said that the "New Network" has started 
to proselytize in Lima shantytowns in an attempt to gain new 
supporters and "establish a new social platform" in order to 
form "combat committees." 
  The "New Network" has three secretariats: militants who 
belonged to the "People's Aid"; a committee of relatives of 
arrested individuals; and a department for workers and 
neighborhoods. 
  The police have also spotted houses belonging to the 
terrorists in various Lima neighborhoods. 
  Lima has always been very important to the SL because the 
attacks perpetrated in the capital have a greater impact abroad, 
such as the destruction of buildings and dozens of deaths on 
Tarta Street in Miraflores, a residential neighborhood in Lima, 
a few months before Abimael Guzman was arrested in Lima on 12 
September 1992. 
  Guzman was arrested with all his closest aids, the same as 
the leadership of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) 
which has sustained even harder blows than the SL. Ninety 
percent of the MRTA leaders, the same as the SL leaders, are 
under arrest and have been sentenced to life imprisonment. 
  Since then the decay of the SL, which, according to Peruvian 
President Alberto Fujimori will have disappeared by 1995 when he 
leaves government if he is not reelected, has been notorious. 
  The Peruvian Communist Party, which is the SL's true name, 
has split up. One of the branches is headed by Abimael Guzman 
who, in letters addressed to President Fujimori in 1993, urged 
his followers to maintain peace and order and not to perpetrate 
attacks. 
  The SL leaders under arrest, after a meeting arranged by the 
government in Lima, decided to support the appeal for peace made 
by Guzman but those who are still free have not followed suit. 
  Although the two groups maintain that they respect the 
ideology of "President Gonzalo" as Guzman is called in the 
cryptic SL language, the truth is that the movement has split up. 
  Moreover, there is no information on Guzman's relationship 
with the government, about which a lot was said until a few days 
before the 31 October 1993 referendum to approve the new 
Peruvian Constitution. 
  Oscar Duran, aka Feliciano, seems to be the new SL leader. 
He and Nestor Cerpa Cartolini, the only important MRTA leader 
still free, are being sought. 
  The daily ONDA today reported that DINCOTE has dismantled 
Cerpa Cartolini's plan to reactivate the MRTA, in an attempt 
apparently similar to that of the SL.

  [Text] -- Lima, 10 Mar (EFE) -- A spokesman for the 
Peruvian Military Justice Supreme Council (CSJM) reported today 
that a Peruvian military judge has asked for the indictment of 
18 Navy officers for their involvement in the embezzlement of 
$40 million. 
  CSJM Judge of Inquiry Marco Rodriguez Huerta delivered his 
report accusing the 18 officers to War Hall Auditor Luis 
Delgado, so that he might request that the prosecutor formally 
ask for a jury trial against these individuals. 
  The 18 officers have been accused of allowing the 
embezzlement to take place, systematically and over a period of 
a number of years, at the offices of the Peruvian attache in 
Washington. The crime was discovered in November 1992. 
  Up until now it was believed that only 11 officers were 
involved in the case. 
  The main culprit in the case, Enrique Villagarcia, an old 
administrator in the attache's office, was condemned to eight 
years' imprisonment in the United States in June of last year 
for violating laws forbidding the use of illegal funds in U.S. 
financial institutions. 
  Villagarcia confessed to that country's judiciary that he 
spent most of the money on cocaine, race horses, and prostitutes. 
  Among the officers involved in the case are a vice admiral 
and four rear admirals who occupied positions in the Navy 
Economy Directorate and who were Navy attaches in the United 
States. 
  The case was denounced by Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori, who said that Villagarcia justified the use of the 
money with forged deposit certificates, drafted with the 
complicity of American Security Bank and Potomac Valley Bank 
employees.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Manuel D'Ornellas: "Seeking a Rival"] </F>
  [Text] In the next few days we will know whether the 
sentences passed down yesterday against the military men charged 
in the case of the murder of 10 students of La Cantuta 
University will be capable of counterbalancing the negative 
impact caused by the approval and promulgation of the law or 
legal trick that kept this case under the jurisdiction of the 
military court. 
  Moreover, it remains yet to be seen whether these sentences 
can repair the tattered image of President Alberto Fujimori 
whose loss of popularity is reflected in the poll conducted by 
Apoyo, Inc. published in this same issue. As we said last 
Sunday, as long as this loss of popularity does not increase 
that of other politicians, in theory, it can be recovered. 
  But it is also a fact that the ups and downs of popularity 
can also result in waves of increases and losses that will 
become uncontrollable. This was the case of the growing 
popularity gained by Fujimori's candidacy that, toward the end 
of the 1990 electoral campaign, at a given point became 
devastating. The same happened with Alan Garcia when he tried 
to place the banking sector under state control and his 
popularity dropped month after month, after having reached the 
highest level of popularity ever reached by a Peruvian leader. 
  It is true that in both cases there was a political 
polarization that does not exist nowadays. In both cases, Mario 
Vargas Llosa's strong personality played a key role in this 
political polarization. Vargas Llosa was responsible for 
Garcia's loss of popularity. Vargas Llosa himself also witnessed 
how an unknown candidate deprived him of an electoral victory of 
which he was certain. 
  Now Fujimori does not have a rival who could capture the 
support he is losing as is revealed by the very poll that shows 
his loss of popularity. Not even the promoted and respected 
image of [Javier] Perez de Cuellar attracts a significant 
portion of the support the chief of state is losing. 
  Undoubtedly, some believe that Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont 
would be the person -- from every viewpoint -- to gain from an 
eventual polarization with Fujimori. 
  So far, however, this polarization has not materialized. 
Maybe because Belmot is still not regarded as a firm 
presidential candidate for the elections which are only one year 
ahead of us. If Belmont were to officially launch his 
candidacy, the race with Fujimori to gain the peoples' support 
would be well worth witnessing.

  [Text] New Minister of the Presidency Raul Vittor Alfaro 
yesterday said that the government will create "at least one 
million new jobs" during the year. The minister also announced 
the construction of 31,000 new three and four story housing 
units throughout the country to help the poor. 
  The minister said these housing units will be financed by 
Fonavi [National Housing Fund], mortgage bonds, and a percentage 
of family savings. The minister added, however, that in some 
cases the government will provide 100 percent of the financing. 
  Alfaro said the government is anticipating a total 
investment 
of approximately $360 million a year. Sixty percent of this 
total will be financed through the sale of mortgage bonds and 20 
percent will come from family savings. 
  The minister did not give figures on investments in Lima or 
the number of units planed for the capital. He mentioned, 
however, the largest interior cities of Cajamarca, Ayacucho, 
Chiclayo, Piura, and Tumbes, among others. 
  Alfaro, who left the Education Ministry and moved to his new 
post only three days ago, did not mention details, but added 
that other projects on the drawing board include the feeding of 
students, increasing the rations of the glass of milk program, 
building school centers, and implementing electricity projects. 
  "These programs will create new jobs. We are thinking of 
building 300 schools on top of what is being contemplated by 
Foncodes [National Compensation and Social Development Fund]," 
Alfaro said. 
  The minister made these remarks during his swearing in 
ceremony at government palace. 
  Later, during a meeting with the presidents of Regional 
Administration Transitory Councils, he called for the immediate 
implementation of a strategy to fight poverty, defeat recession, 
and create jobs throughout the country through regional 
governments and by offering incentives to the private sector. 
  Alfaro said that one of his portfolio's priorities is to 
fight extreme poverty and asked the 12 regional presidents and 
the presidents of Corde Lima [Lima Development Corporation] and 
Corde Callao [El Callao Development Corporation] to begin 
working seriously, cautiously, responsibly, and honestly. 
  "Let us begin working immediately so that one year from now, 
in March 1995, the people can say now we have jobs," Alfaro said. 
  "This is what the government wants, to create the greatest 
possible number of jobs," the minister added. 
  During the meeting, the minister and the presidents 
discussed 
this year's projections and the programs that will be 
implemented in the regions. 
  "We must make optimum use of our human resources. It will 
greatly help our development," the minister said.

  [Text] Tokyo, 23 Feb (EFE) -- Peruvian Prime Minister 
Efrain Goldenberg said today in Tokyo that Japanese investors 
will gradually return to Peru because of the economic reforms 
and the control over terrorism being implemented by the 
government. 
  Goldenberg made this comment to EFE in Tokyo, where he is 
attending a two-day seminar on investments in Latin America that 
opened today. It is sponsored by the Nikko brokers firm. 
  Goldenberg spoke before 300 Japanese businessmen. He 
recalled the "constricting squint" of previous governments which 
ruined the country through bad administration and violence 
until, late in the 1980's, the country became an "outcast" from 
the international financial community. 
  Goldenberg predicted that the starting point for the return 
of Japanese businessmen will be the meeting of the 
Peruvian-Japanese Business Committee to be held next September 
in Lima. This meeting will also be attended by a Japanese 
business delegation headed by Kazuo Haruna, president of 
Marubeni Trading Company. 
  Japanese sources showed interest in a greater presence in 
Peru in face of the improved economic situation and social 
stability, although they are still cautious. 
  Goldenberg admitted: "It is difficult to erase all traces of 
terrorism" but assured that the government of President Fujimori 
will do away with guerrilla groups in 1995. 
  Regarding his lecture on economic reforms, Goldenberg 
highlighted the efforts of the Peruvian Government to conclude 
the privatization of state companies with the sale of the mining 
and oil companies next November. 
  Asked about the little interest shown by Japan to invest in 
the privatization process, Goldenberg said "the doors are open 
to all," and did not discard the idea that he may receive some 
offers. 
  Goldenberg added: "We built the legal framework for reforms, 
the pacification of the country continues, and we will continue 
to work on the privatization process and on ways to achieve the 
investments needed for our development." 
  He also thanked the Japanese for the formation of the 
support 
group which provided the bridge credits that allowed Peru to 
negotiate with its creditors in the Paris Club. He added that 
Peru will soon negotiate its debt with the private banks. 
  Goldenberg also thanked the Japanese for their "support and 
understanding" over the political reforms introduced by 
President Fujimori. Japan was one of the few countries that did 
not threaten to withdraw its economic aid following the 
"self-coup" by Fujimori in April 1992. 
  The seminar was attended by political leaders and bankers of 
Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay as well as by 
Inter- American Development Bank President Enrique Iglesias who 
was present at the formation of the first support group for Peru 
in Nagoya (Japan) in April 1991.

  [Excerpt] On 8 March Paraguayan President Juan Carlos 
Wasmosy appointed Mario Lujan Melgarejo as acting president of 
the National Development Bank [BNF] replacing Rolando Eligio 
Bogado Martinez who was thanked for his services as head of the 
BNF. 
  The appointment of Mario Lujan Melgarejo, a economist by 
profession, is the second time President Wasmosy has replaced a 
key official in his administration since the peasant crisis 
began. The peasants criticized the Agrarian Reform Institute, 
the BNF, and the Agricultural Development Fund for not serving 
the interests of farmers. [passage omitted]

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Asuncion NOTICIAS in Spanish on 12 March 
publishes on pages 2 and 3 three articles on peasant leaders' 
reactions to comments made by Paraguayan President Juan Carlos 
Wasmosy in Santiago, Chile, about problems causing social unrest 
among peasants in Paraguay. 
  On page 2, a 200-word article by reporter Robert Figueredo 
from Coronel Oviedo notes that local peasant leaders consider 
the comments by Wasmosy "inappropriate." The leaders 
furthermore believe, according to the article, that "Wasmosy's 
intention is to divert international attention from the real 
problems affecting the majority of peasants." Leader Rafael 
Ruiz Diaz, who is coordinating the mobilization of peasants for 
a demonstration in front of Congress in Asuncion on 15 March, is 
quoted as saying: "This is the type of comment that shows the 
government's negative attitude toward listening to our demands, 
but it gives us greater unity, more enthusiasm, for the large 
demonstration to be held in front of Congress on 15 March." 
  On page 3 a 300-word article by reporter Adolfo Traverssi 
from Villarrica notes that the main peasant leader in Caazapa, a 
Mr. De los Santos Vazquez, said that Wasmosy's comments are "not 
true." He added: "If the president said that the peasant 
leaders have not planted a single square meter of cotton, I will 
say of him that he is a tourist president. Thanks to peasant 
leaders like us, he is always travelling." Santos said he was 
astonished that while Wasmosy was abroad he had discredited the 
peasants who are doing miraculous things to produce more for the 
benefit of the country. He added: "Instead of discrediting us, 
our president should seriously think of changing his government 
policy and aiming his cooperation toward the rural areas, where 
the Paraguayan economic potential is located." 
  Also on page 3, an unattributed 300-word article notes the 
comments made by Tomas Zayas of the Alto Parana Agricultural 
Association. Zayas said that Wasmosy's comments are "shameful, 
as he is unaware of the real situation of his own people." 
Zayas added that anyone could see just by looking that there 
has been a 50 percent reduction in cotton production, and not 5 
percent, as indicated by Wasmosy. Zayas said: "The president 
and those responsible for the country's agricultural policy are 
irresponsible, because that figure was disclosed by officials of 
the Agriculture and Livestock Ministry." Zayas also rejected 
Wasmosy's comments that the peasant leaders are agitators. He 
said they are peasants living in a land that had been 
expropriated by Congress and vetoed by Wasmosy. Zayas concluded 
by saying: "The president has shown once more his 
irresponsibility in looking for agitators, subversives, 
guerrillas, communists, and atheists among the peasants."

  [Excerpt] "Ladies and gentlemen, Paraguayan Airlines 
[LAPSA] announces the suspension of all its flights." This is 
the announcement that might have been expected, but it was never 
uttered. The lack of money said everything, and therefore the 
airplanes did not fly yesterday, operations being suspended 
until the company is privatized. If the airline had continued 
to operate it would have lost $4.3 million this month. A quick 
decision by Congress is expected for its privatization. The 
bill will be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies on 10 March. 
  Yesterday at noon, the LAPSA Board of Directors suspended 
the 
DC-10 flight to Miami. Then the Privatization Council announced 
to the Board of Directors the suspension of all flights. The 
operations were suspended because without state aid the company 
had no funds to continue operating. The president of the 
Bicameral Privatization Committee said if operations continued 
the company would lose $4.3 million in March alone. [passage

  [Text] DPRK Vice Premier Kim Pok-sin arrived yesterday in 
Paraguay, heading a delegation that seeks to establish 
diplomatic ties with Paraguay. During a news conference, Kim 
Pok-sin said the DPRK is an independent country and as such he 
sees no obstacle in establishing ties with other independent 
countries. 
  The DPRK delegation is scheduled to meet with political 
party 
leaders and the vice president. The delegation also plans to 
meet with President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. Government sources 
questioned have stated, however, that this meeting is "uncalled 
for" because Paraguay and DPRK have no diplomatic ties. 
  This is the first DPRK delegation to visit Paraguay. It is 
an unofficial visit. The delegation is visiting in response to 
an invitation extended by the Febrerista Revolutionary Party 
(PRF). 
  During a news conference at the international airport, Kim 
Pon-sin said this visit follows his country's wish to strengthen 
ties with Paraguay. 
  Asked if the ideological and territorial differences with 
South Korea will obstruct an eventual establishment of 
diplomatic ties, Kim Pok-sin said: "We are an independent 
country and we are aware of the patriotism of Paraguayans. We 
also know that Paraguay is an independent country. I do not 
believe there will be many problems." 
  PRF President Victor Hugo Sanchez stated that the visit of 
the DPRK vice premier "may be the start of auspicious bilateral 
ties." 
  Kim Pok-sin is scheduled to meet Vice President Angel 
Roberto 
Seifart tomorrow at 1000. At night the PRF board will host a 
reception in honor of the DPRK delegation at the party 
headquarters. 
  On 12 March, the delegation will visit the Itaipu dam which, 
Kim Pok-sin said is of particular interest to them because the 
DPRK builds hydroelectric dams. It has been reported that the 
delegation is scheduled to meet party presidents next week.

  [Text] Santiago, Chile -- Paraguay will support the 
candidacy of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria to become the OAS 
secretary general. This confirmation was made yesterday by 
President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, during an approximately 20-minute 
meeting with Gaviria at the Carreras Hotel in Santiago. 
  It has also been learned that the U.S. assistant secretary 
of 
state for inter-American affairs, Alexander Watson, asked 
Paraguay to vote for Gaviria, whose efforts in the struggle 
against drug trafficking and the Colombian mafia have satisfied 
Washington. 
  "We confirmed our support for him," said Wasmosy after the 
meeting with Gaviria, even though the previous administration of 
General Andres Rodriguez had promised its support to Costa Rican 
Foreign Minister Paul Niheaus, who is also here in Santiago 
holding meetings seeking support. 
  NOTICIAS talked with Gaviria on his desire to become OAS 
secretary general. Gaviria said he hopes the result of the 
final elections in the OAS will serve to strengthen that 
inter-American organization. 
  He said: "I have great confidence in their maturity, in how 
the countries value my representation and what I can do as 
leader of OAS." 
  Asked about the pressure the United States is reportedly 
exerting in favor of his candidacy, he said: "I believe the 
United States is simply expressing the opinion it has always 
held on the qualifications I may have for holding that position. 
That or any other country of the Americas has the right to 
express an opinion publicly."

<F P=106> [By special NOTICIAS correspondents from Santiago, Chile] </F>
  [Text] The United States has asked Paraguayan President 
Juan Carlos Wasmosy to be "prudent" in handling peasant 
problems, bearing in mind recent social outbursts in the 
continent, as in the Mexican region of Chiapas. During his 
meeting with Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant secretary for 
inter-American affairs, Wasmosy acknowledged the situation but 
at the same time lashed out at peasant leaders, stating that 
they spend their time blocking roads but do not plant a single 
square meter of cotton. Watson also asked the Paraguayan 
Government to explain why U.S. troops and materiel were not 
allowed to enter Paraguay. 
  The U.S. Government is closely following recent problems 
with 
Paraguayan peasants. These problems are a source of some 
concern, given the social outbursts that have taken place in 
Latin America, namely in Santiago del Estero Province in 
Argentina, in Chiapas Province in Mexico, and in some Central 
American nations to a lesser degree. 
  Assistant Secretary Watson clarified certain controversial 
items that had caused some tension in Paraguayan-U.S. relations, 
asked President Wasmosy for caution and prudence in dealing with 
the demands of Paraguayan peasants, and advocated dialogue and 
consensus between the parties involved. 
  Wasmosy admitted that the high-ranking U.S. official had 
indicated that the peasant problem should be handled very 
carefully, and reported that he explained to Watson that the 
people blocking roads were not exactly peasants. "I told him 
that the people who are blocking the roads are leaders who have 
not planted any cotton themselves. There are, however, some 
peasants who -- because of low productivity -- will not be able 
to recover from three years of bad crops, even if the price of 
cotton hits 850 guaranies per kilogram," Wasmosy said. 
  Wasmosy also reiterated his pet argument that in the 
framework of a free market economy it was not up to the 
government to set the price of cotton. 
  Asked about the U.S. reaction to the conditions that the 
Paraguayan Government had set to admit U.S. troops, Wasmosy 
answered that the doors are open to any joint exercise with the 
Paraguayan Army and civilians, "provided it does not violate any 
constitutional principles. I believe that we made this very 
clear and he (Watson) was very satisfied," Wasmosy added. 
  President Wasmosy stated that the U.S. State Department 
official wanted to know firsthand the official report on the 
aborted military operation that the United States had asked to 
be allowed to conduct in the area of San Pedro. It would seem 
that Watson listened to this report carefully, as it may have a 
bearing on any further U.S. military assistance to Paraguay. 
  Watson also reiterated that the U.S. Government is still 
concerned over the evidence it has that Paraguay continues to be 
a key link in regional drug trafficking. "I told him that we 
need help, training, and resources, to fight drug trafficking," 
Wasmosy said. He emphasized that Washington's envoy heard out 
the concerns of the Paraguayan Government and will relay them to 
the appropriate U.S. drug enforcement officials. 
  Together with the other chiefs of state who have arrived in 
Santiago, Wasmosy went to Valparaiso at noon on 11 February to 
attended President Eduardo Frei Ruiz Tagle's installation. 
  President Wasmosy will return at approximately 1500 local 
time today together with OAS Secretary General Joao Clemente 
Baena Soares. There is no official information on the agenda of 
Baena Soares in Paraguay.

  [Text] Yesterday, Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] 
Director Augusto Ramirez Ocampo called the recent political 
incidents very worrisome, particularly the attack on the Mario 
Valiente caravan and the attack on Arena [Nationalist Republican 
Alliance] deputy candidate Julio Gamero. "These attacks go 
against the agreement signed by the parties before Onusal," 
Ramirez Ocampo said. 
  The diplomat explained that as election day approaches, 
naturally political temperatures increase and more political 
rallies are held, however, the rallies held this past weekend 
were very worrisome. Given this, Dr. Ramirez Ocampo said that 
currently, Onusal is meeting with all the presidential 
candidates and asking them to watch their language and to 
recommend to their supporters that they comply with the fair 
campaign agreement, without verbal or physical violence, signed 
last year. In addition, he called on the population in general 
to be calm and to hold democratic elections, like the Salvadoran 
people and the international community want. 
  Regarding the previously mentioned cases, the head of Onusal 
stated his organization is acquiring information to inform those 
involved at a later date. 
  When asked if the commitment made by the candidates is being 
violated, Ramirez Ocampo clearly said that aside from the 
aforementioned events, there have been no other regrettable 
incidents despite the fact that the parties have scheduled 
political activities at the same times and places. Ramirez 
Ocampo concluded, "Onusal has been present at 655 political 
rallies, and it has confirmed that citizens and candidates have 
observed the commitment made, which will not be affected by the 
latest incidents."

<F P=106> [State of the Nation Address by President Carlos Roberto </F>
Reina in Tegucigalpa on 8 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] Fellow countrymen: Thirty nine days ago I promised I 
would carry out the moral revolution. The moral revolution has 
begun in Honduras. Without any sort of experience, we have 
taken the moral revolution's first and most important step: We 
inaugurated a new style of government. As we said in our 
campaign, we shall tell the people the truth about the country's 
reality. Throughout the history of our country, politicians, 
using demagogic phrases to reach power, have convinced the 
people with pledges, only to govern against the country's 
interests. 
  When I became president, I found an economy in crisis and 
worse still, a people who are tired of deceptions and 
unfulfilled promises. We found a huge foreign debt and a 
gigantic social debt. In the new style of government, we will 
call a spade a spade. No more hiding the truth from the 
country; no more mirages to disguise sacrifices. The state of 
the nation is worse than what we believed it to be before taking 
office. Our resolve, however, is firm in the face of the great 
task the people have entrusted to us. 
  First, we were told the fiscal deficit would be 3 percent of 
the GNP; later, the previous administration confessed it was 5 
percent. Now, we discover it is more than 10 percent. In the 
old style of government, tough decisions were put off. Certain 
points of elusive popularity were exchanged for those of lasting 
sacrifices by the people -- the current electricity deficit is 
just one example -- because proper measures were not taken; 
technicians' recommendations were not heeded at the right time, 
and today we are suffering unavoidable power blackouts because 
of the need to ration electricity. 
  In the old style of government, Cold War tensions took 
precedence over feelings of fatherland and sovereignty. In the 
old style of government, the ideology of state affairs was above 
respect for human rights. In that old style of government, 
economic policies reflected more what foreign organizations 
wanted than the [word indistinct] interests of the majority of 
our people. In the old style of government, laws were bent when 
they blocked powerful interests or when it was suitable to carry 
out urgent business with quick profits. In the old style of 
government, a few were awarded privileges at the expense of the 
majority. In a nutshell, the old style took into account the 
next election while forgetting the next generation by disguising 
problems and putting off decisions. It submitted to foreign 
demands; at home, it was corrupt; it purchased more than it 
produced; it favored a few people while crushing many. 
  The truth that was hidden in the past now appears with its 
load of problems -- all urgent and distressing -- but we are 
ready to face them and begin to solve them. In the new style of 
government, there will be no putting off difficult decisions; no 
more giving in to inappropriate pressures; no more inequities in 
the distribution and sacrifice of benefits; no more disregarding 
the human factor when dealing with the economy. 
  As president of all Hondurans, I appear before the nation to 
seriously and responsibly explain the country's difficult 
situation and the measures to be taken. 
  It is necessary to point out that just when the new 
government began its term, the inflationary pressures that had 
been removed during 1993 flared up. During the first two months 
of the current year, the estimated yearly inflation rate 
skyrocketed to more than 24 percent. This means the price of 
goods in the basic consumer basket has increased. The increase 
was mainly sparked by the fact that prices, which the recent 
past government had frozen by executive decree, were released at 
the beginning of February and took an upward trend. Another 
reason for the increase is the speculation carried out by 
unscrupulous merchants. 
  Furthermore, [words indistinct] unwarranted measures that 
did 
not conform to the 1993 budget norms, prompted an increase of 
expenses, subsidies, and investments. Such measures were so 
detrimental that the former government's expenses exceeded its 
revenues by 2.3 billion lempiras, which is more than 10 percent 
of the GNP and five times the country's deficit. The former 
government should have acted with fiscal responsibility and, 
instead of thinking about electoral results, should have taken 
into account that their actions would have adverse consequences 
for most people. 
  Another element that contributed to this inflation is the 
reasonable uncertainty about the transition period to the new 
government. However, in this case, the situation was magnified 
by concern over how the moral revolution government would react 
to such a difficult economic situation. 
  I address all the sectors in the country -- workers, 
peasants, professionals, and businessmen -- to say that the 
government over which I preside will act with responsibility and 
will work with the necessary seriousness and diligence, to 
correct the serious imbalance in our public finances. To 
further this end, we have instructed the Central Bank to prepare 
a monetary program that agrees with the economic situation. We 
have also taken measures which, despite the minor margins in the 
available options, have already allowed us to rescue Honduras' 
credibility and obtain the necessary support from abroad to 
finance our commercial imbalance, which amounted to 2.18 billion 
lempiras in 1993. 
  As president of Honduras, I have begun a fraternal 
rapprochement with Costa Rican President-elect Jose Maria 
Figueres. We have agreed that Honduras and Costa Rica will 
prepare joint platforms to resolve our respective problems, 
especially those related to foreign relations, foreign 
financing, and the defense of democracy. This agreement 
anticipates excellent possibilities in the immediate future. 
  The actions we have carried out up to now have generated a 
climate of prevailing trust and certitude. We no longer have 
room for speculation. Thus, we expect those who use such 
practices against society to abandon them immediately for the 
benefit of their own peace of mind and to further the superior 
interests of the majority. 
  I hereby reiterate to the Honduran people what they already 
know from personal experience because they have suffered it 
during the past four years at the hands of the dehumanized 
neoliberals. I refer to the skyrocketing inflation rate, which 
reached an annual average of 19 percent in the past four years. 
True salaries have been reduced both in rural areas and cities. 
All of this has contributed to impoverishing the Honduran 
people even further, affecting mostly the middle and low-income 
classes. It should not be necessary for me to expand on what 
the people have already suffered. Inflation is the heaviest 
burden that any government could impose on a nation. Consistent 
with this, my government is determined to reduce the price hike 
rate. We will offer to the great majorities the enormous social 
benefit we have in store for them: prices in accordance with 
their true salaries. 
  We will now discuss anti-inflation measures and the fiscal 
deficit. To counter this inflation process in the short term, 
we intend to reduce the fiscal deficit because, if public 
expenditures continue to be managed in the same way or in much 
the same way as the previous government managed them, the fiscal 
deficit would amount to 2.7 billion lempiras in 1994. With this 
in mind, and regarding expenditures, we have started a fiscal 
year of austerity by reducing the central government's 
expenditures by 10 percent. Apart from autonomous institutions, 
this reduction will not affect priority social sectors. 
Consistent with this goal, we are reprogramming public sector 
investment by establishing an order of priorities. 
Consequently, all the projects that have to be regarded as 
unpostponable because of their importance as economic and/or 
social development factors will be provided with the required 
funds. The highway network's permanent maintenance and expansion 
is one of these priorities. We will continue to allocate 35 
percent of the country's budget to support social development 
programs and to combat poverty. 
  There will be no more irregular subsidies, and we will only 
keep those we can afford, according to the law and our financial 
capability. The subsidy to the transportation sector is one of 
them. Regarding revenues, we will implement the following 
actions: 
  We will send to the National Congress the tax code bill the 
implementation of which will allow us to improve the collection 
of taxes and their management. This tax code will include 
severe punishment for tax evaders and defrauders. Regarding 
this same topic, we will send the National Congress an 
initiative to increase the number of taxable products without 
altering the 7-percent sales tax currently in effect. As far as 
income tax is concerned, we will increase the minimum tax-exempt 
income to compensate the inflationary effect and we will abolish 
the 10-percent and 15-percent surcharge, to reduce that tax's 
marginal rate to 35 percent. 
  We will endorse reforms to the provisional import law, and 
we 
will review public services tariffs according to the changes in 
their costs. With these measures, we hope to reduce the fiscal 
deficit, which, if we had continued to handle things the way the 
previous government did, would have amounted to 11.2 [unit of 
measurement not given] of the GDP for 1994. In this way we will 
avoid having to finance the deficit with disproportionate 
inflationary effects. Our efforts clearly show that, contrary to 
the course of the recent past, the government will be the entity 
that will have to sacrifice the most in correcting the fiscal 
imbalance, with the austerity program implemented. 
  We will refer to the balance of payments. The balance of 
payments deficit is structural. It constitutes one of the most 
serious problems that we face. To solve it, therefore, requires 
time. It mainly deals with strengthening and increasing 
national production. In the short-term, the qualitative and 
quantitative improvement of the production sector requires 
foreign aid. In the medium-term, we propose to establish the 
necessary mechanisms and instruments to increase credit offers 
and improve technological conditions and marketing practices. 
  We have a medium-term financial plan of approximately $700 
million with rapidly disbursed external funds to support the 
balance of payments. The disbursement of these resources began 
in 1994, and we expect to cover the financial gap to prevent 
speculation with the foreign exchange rate. This will allow us 
to attain relative stability with the foreign exchange rate and 
protect the capability of our exports to compete. 
  We must now refer to two critical problems which afflict the 
country and which we are looking into on a priority basis. One 
of them is the grievous food problem that afflicts the majority 
of the Honduran people. The government's action in the short 
term will concentrate on the availability of and access to 
credit for the agricultural production sector; organizing the 
marketing of these products; and granting technical aid to small 
and medium- level producers. 
  We will have tariffs to protect production of basic grains, 
to render their price profitable for the producer and accessible 
to the consumer. We will provide a weekly report on the status 
of these prices. We will establish, according to our potential, 
a credit fund in commercial banks to provide financing for the 
production of these grains. We will establish rural savings and 
credit funds and 60 percent of the Banadesa [National Bank for 
Agricultural Development] credit line will be committed to 
supporting agricultural production activities. We will maintain 
a strategic reserve to prevent shortages. 
  The other critical problem is the electricity sector crisis. 
We are aware of the vital importance of solving this complex 
problem so we have issued the necessary instructions. As a 
result of this, I can report that the 70-megawatt deficit we 
inherited will be reduced to 62 megawatts in April and 13 
megawatts in May; and the generation of electricity in December 
will be equal to the demand. I assure my fellow citizens my 
government is adopting the adequate measures to prevent this 
deficit situation from recurring. As a result of this decision, 
my government will provide sustained support to the private 
production of electricity. We intend to establish a legal and 
administrative framework that facilitates the necessary 
procedures to render viable the private sector's participation 
in the production of electricity. 
  We will also expedite the collection of accrued ENEE 
[National Enterprise for Electric Power] bills -- 190 million 
lempiras for the private sector only, as of 31 December. The 
government and the ENEE will maintain the compensation mechanism 
between that enterprise's debt and the government's energy 
consumption. 
  Given its importance to the creation of jobs and its role in 
the construction industry, my government will adopt the 
necessary measures to guarantee a sufficient and timely supply 
of cement. 
  My government knows it cannot limit itself to short-term 
actions once we have implemented the measures aimed at solving 
the problems we have outlined, and once their main effects have 
been countered. Instead, we must strive to achieve the country's 
overall development with realistic plans and programs, and the 
creation of a general strategy that renders coherent the public 
and private sectors' actions. A basic principle of our strategy 
is to fulfill social needs and drastically reduce extreme 
poverty before the 21st century begins. 
  It has been proven throughout history that the general 
benefits of economic growth never extend automatically or 
spontaneously to poor sectors. That alleged spilling over of 
the benefits of growth also does not occur in the short term. 
This is why the state is duty-bound to exercise its function of 
maintaining a balance and of promoting the common good. We view 
this social development policy as part of the overall 
development strategy because it integrates the social and 
economic sectors, consolidating the democratic process and 
justifying the governments that emerge from it. 
  On the basis of these guidelines, my government has decided 
to issue measures to immediately improve the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the social policies and expenditures through 
adequate coordination and technical management. 
  The poorest sectors will have priority in these actions. It 
will promote access to employment through policies that lead to 
the massive creation of jobs in keeping with the best traditions 
of liberal governments. 
  We are reviewing labor laws to make them compatible with the 
current demands of workers and businessmen, within the framework 
of a policy of equitable, dynamic, sustained, and highly 
competitive economic growth. 
  We will support the national action plan for development, 
especially for human development, for children and youths, 
giving priority to the establishment of conditions that offer 
equal opportunities to women in all sectors of the nation's life. 
  Honduras' educational problem has its roots in the historic 
negligence of governments. After the reform promoted by Ramon 
Rosa [19th century liberal politician], no government has viewed 
education as a true national priority. That grave historic 
error explains why in our country we have a shameful illiteracy 
rate while 5,000 teachers are unemployed. I promise to correct 
this situation in my administration, which will allocate to the 
education sector greater resources every year. I will 
immediately instruct the Education Ministry to incorporate into 
the education programs as soon as possible the civic, 
democratic, and patriotic dimension that should be taught to all 
Hondurans. In fulfillment of the commitment that I consider my 
most important campaign promise, I have issued instructions to 
the Education Ministry to begin a massive literacy program that 
will make sure that the next century will find Honduras without 
a single illiterate person. In this great task, we will 
incorporate all sectors of society, including the Armed Forces. 
I think all Hondurans have an unpostponable duty to be aware 
that the eradication of illiteracy in our country is the most 
honorable and productive goal we can establish. We must admit 
that illiterate persons are the victim of social indifference 
and that illiteracy is an affront to and a burden on all 
society. The moral revolution pledges to foster the spirit that 
will awaken consciences and instill determination to achieve 
such a beautiful goal. 
  With strict observance of university autonomy ordered by the 
Constitution, my government will give special attention to 
higher education, aimed at improving its 
scientific-technological quality and thus incorporating it into 
the social production process. 
  In the health sector, we aim to achieve the following: 
reduce 
infant, prenatal, and maternal mortality 26-30 percent with 
regard to the numbers registered in 1992. Likewise, we will 
reduce severe malnutrition in children under five and the number 
of infants with low birth weight. With the cooperation of 
friendly nations, we have undertaken the task of resolving the 
serious situation we found in the public hospitals. An order has 
been issued for the immediate supply of medicines, 
medical-surgical equipment, and all the supplies necessary for 
these hospitals to fulfill their humanitarian tasks in an 
appropriate and timely fashion. 
  In the environmental cleanup sector for the 90's, we have 
adopted the goal established by the United Nations on a global 
level for the previous decade. That is, provide water and 
environmental cleanup projects for 50 percent of the population. 
With the fraternal aid of some nations, we will take the 
necessary steps to supply potable water to 2 million Hondurans 
in the mid-term. To achieve this, a dynamic and sustained growth 
process in production and jobs should be initiated as soon as 
possible. 
  The government commits to reaching the goal of 5 percent 
true 
growth rate annually beginning in 1995. This would then 
generate a true increase in per capita income by 2.2 percent. To 
achieve these growth targets, substantially larger levels of 
private investment and local savings than those obtained so far 
are required. 
  During the past four years, investment opportunities have 
been offered to private capital, however, the response to local 
investment has been very poor. This indicates that the private 
sector has not made the effort expected. We invite local and 
foreign investors to participate in the development of Honduras 
by increasing their investments in the sectors they are 
interested in. Consequently, we are offering to achieve and 
maintain a stable macroeconomics framework and a transparent and 
fair system of laws, as well as attractive returns, particularly 
in those sectors where Honduras has comparative advantages. One 
of these is the manufacturing sector, particularly the 
industrial processing zones. In less than four years, private 
investment can generate up to 100,000 jobs. In all areas of 
investment, my government will offer appropriate incentives, 
particularly in tourism, mining, forest exploitation services, 
and the export of traditional and nontraditional agricultural 
products. 
  With the participation of the private sectors, we are 
certain 
we will achieve our goal of constructing 50,000 housing units in 
the next four years. We have already begun negotiating with 
construction and financing companies. We will promote and 
stimulate the private sector to revitalize the industrial 
sector, and we will support worker training programs. 
  Because of its great importance, we reiterate that Honduras 
will establish favorable conditions for private investment. 
Those conditions will allow private investors to participate in 
providing public services, such as electricity generation and 
telecommunications. 
  Regarding Hondutel [Honduras Telecommunications Enterprise], 
after we study all the possible forms of privatization, we will 
try to reach agreements with all the sectors involved. Once 
this has been done, we will make every effort to get the 
required approval from the National Congress to carry out the 
designated transaction. The privatization will be carried out in 
an exemplary and faultless manner. It must provide the people 
with clear benefits. Any way, most of the resources obtained 
from this transaction will be assigned to pay the social debt, 
which has been pending for such a long time. 
  In the context of our development policy, we will give the 
necessary incentives to private investment so its contribution 
can reach significant proportions. We will also encourage the 
repatriation of capital, which is one of our basic goals. To 
this end, we will implement mechanisms that will expedite 
paperwork and offer investors' security. One of our medium-term 
goals is to ensure that the flow of capital closes the balance 
of payment gap, boosts international reserves, and contributes 
to foreign exchange stability. In order to increase the volume 
of investments the country needs, it is necessary to increase 
our domestic savings capacity in addition to maintaining 
currency exchange in stable condition. The government will 
modernize the national financial system to ensure that 
savings-account holders obtain a better yield. In this respect, 
the government will propose two laws to the National Congress: 
the National Banking and Insurance Commission Law and the 
Financial Institutions Law. Later, we will reform the Central 
Bank Law and the laws dealing with companies, insurances, and 
others. 
  We will give equal or more importance to the modernization 
of 
the social welfare system, which can be a key factor in the 
development of capital markets. Therefore, we want a system in 
which each contributor can establish his pension fund according 
to his means. We will also evaluate the benefits of giving the 
management of those resources to the private sector. The 
government, however, would still be responsible for establishing 
minimum payments, providing savings incentives, and guaranteeing 
their security. 
  The economic transformation of Honduras requires a modern 
and 
efficient government, one the people who save can have 
confidence in. One that offers guarantees to investors, and in 
general, offers security and equitable treatment to nationals 
and foreigners. To this end, the government pledges to 
immediately start reforming the public sector and will emphasize 
the following programs to further its objective: 
  Public administration, controlling corruption, strengthening 
the state of law and civilian society, and reforming the 
judicial system. In addition, the government will continue its 
policy of commercial openness, and, among other benefits, it 
will promote the international investments we need to complement 
our financial and technological resources. 
  The government will maintain its commitment to the Central 
American integration process as a platform to achieve high 
quality production. We will support initiatives to strengthen 
regional infrastructures, and thereby facilitate cooperation 
among Central American producers to face competition challenges 
in both regional and world markets. 
  We will also support the harmonization of macroeconomics 
policies and public service costs in the region so as not to 
disadvantage Honduran businessmen with our neighbors. Already we 
are working hard to gain access to NAFTA markets and thereby 
multiply Honduras' attraction for foreign investments. My 
government, together with other regional governments, will 
encourage Central America's entry into NAFTA. We will continue 
negotiating with Caribbean countries, Mexico, Venezuela, and 
Colombia, and will give priority to trade with Europe and Japan. 
  Environmental protection is one of my government's 
priorities. Therefore, our development policies will incorporate 
the principles of sustained use of natural resources and 
environmental protection. In order to counter the accelerated 
and progressive deterioration of forests, we will give priority 
to the development of massive conservation and reforestation 
programs, as well as the implementation of the Rio Principles on 
Environment and Development. 
  Given its special importance, I believe it is pertinent to 
reiterate that we have already recovered the government's 
credibility in all internal sectors. I reiterate, we will keep 
that credibility intact. We have also recovered our credibility 
in friendly countries and international organizations, which 
have already given us their support. I must stress that in my 
opinion the agenda of those international organizations for the 
90's is very similar to my government's social agenda, which 
gives priority to human development. 
  Compatriots, in order to reach our objectives in the areas 
of 
social and economic development, investment, and savings, we 
need the commitment and consensus of all sectors. I will 
dedicate my efforts in the next few weeks to this initiative. 
The signing of a social pact among all Honduran sectors is 
absolutely essential. The gist of that pact will be to defend 
our national interests and improve the quality of our lives. 
  I take this opportunity to call a national forum in which we 
will all sign a national agreement for stability and economic 
growth with equity; a forum to reach a consensus and obtain the 
fruits we need for the benefit of the people. 
  Compatriots, the old government style meant a setback for 
Honduras. We will emphasize moral aspects in our government 
style because without them corruption advances, the country 
retrogresses, and democracy is endangered. The government of the 
moral revolution thinks about the present and the next 
generation. It works to give future generations a greater 
fatherland. 
  We are aware of the need to affirm our sovereignty over the 
territories recovered in Naguaterique, Dolores and other 
regions. It is a national goal that cannot be postponed any 
longer. Something that can never be forgiven is that as result 
of indolence or clumsiness, we avoided our obligation to 
consolidate our legal ownership and provide effective attention 
to our compatriots along the border through positive actions 
commemorating the judicial victory of The Hague. 
  We are also interested in our youth. We want to offer and 
encourage the transition to a voluntary military service system. 
While the National Congress, however, independently decides to 
follow through with the required constitutional reform, we will 
seek a mechanism whereby the service will also include a greater 
educational content and the conscription process will not result 
in the same traumas it has caused in the past. 
  I am aware that the next generation needs to feel proud of 
its ancestors. The next generation also needs its ancestors' 
names to be unblemished. It does not need its ill-gotten gains. 
Carlos Roberto Reina's descendants will receive a spotless name. 
The president of the republic will not intervene, in any way, in 
any type of business transaction or private association. There 
will no longer be any classified allotments in the presidential 
office, nor will we allow any in the government sector. 
  My fellow countrymen, an investigation into corruption 
charges has already been launched. In this respect, we have 
appointed preliminary intervention commissions at the National 
Supply Agency for Basic Products, the Central Penitentiary, the 
National Social Welfare Board, as well as other public education 
institutions. Per an executive decree, we have established the 
Intervention and Supervision Commission [Commission Interventora 
y Fiscalizadora] with ample resources to investigate 
indictments, inquiries by private citizens, and commissions 
appointed for this purpose. The Intervention and Supervision 
Commission includes two government representatives, two COEP 
[expansion unknown] members, one representative of the workers, 
one representative of professional associations, one member of 
the opposition party, and a representative of the media. 
  Following a 60-day period, beginning the day it is sworn-in, 
the commission will present a report on all the cases where 
there is evidence of corruption. Each case will be transferred 
to the appropriate courts subject to whatever legal action it 
may merit. These commissions are not instruments of 
retaliation; they are not courts to carry out witch hunts 
either. The commissions cannot and do not pretend to replace 
the justice system. Their responsibility is to prove whether or 
not there is sufficient evidence of corruption. Once this is 
determined, it is up to the judges to send the embezzlers to 
jail. 
  We are not looking for scapegoats. We are looking for the 
real criminals who always hide in their mansions. In a legal 
state, criminals end up in jail when society is able to prove 
they have broken the law. We understand and share the 
population's concern with respect to a timely end to impunity 
and penalties for criminals. We are working hard to accomplish 
this. We already have evidence leading to the people responsible 
for certain crimes against the people and the national economy. 
The penalties must be implemented in a serious and objective 
manner as demanded by the law. One wrong or prejudiced step 
could encourage excuses or legal maneuvers to cover up the crime. 
  Honduras' moral revolution will only be possible with your 
cooperation, with the courageous participation of every citizen 
who knows an official took or is taking money that belongs to 
all Hondurans. In the next 30 days, we will send a draft code of 
conduct for public officials to the National Congress so we can 
institutionalize technical principles to regulate the behavior 
of managers of the Republic. 
  Fellow citizens, my government is firmly determined to take 
on the great deficits we inherited. Overall, the government has 
a coherent economic and social policy. The government has a 
clear vision and direction toward the future, but that decision, 
those policies, that direction, and that vision can only become 
a reality with the participation of all Hondurans. As a 
candidate, I offer [pauses] offered to launch a great national 
agreement. Today, as head of state, I propose the agenda for 
that great agreement. 
  We need a meeting of and pledge from all active sectors in 
Honduras in connection with the vast national goal. We need a 
strong agreement, and that requires a strong civilian society, a 
strong private sector, and an equally strong state. A strong 
state is not a large state; it is a legal state, meaning a state 
which relies on the respect and trust of its citizens rather 
than weapons. A state that is sovereign rather than submissive 
in its dialogue with other states and with multilateral 
organizations. A strong state is the one which exercises strong 
leadership, assumes responsibilities, establishes goals, and 
achieves solutions. 
  To achieve this we will accelerate the state's 
modernization. 
I hope to see the leaders of every sector together at a work 
table, reaching agreements on ways to sponsor the overall 
development of our homeland; jointly establishing, with a lofty, 
patriotic, and fraternal spirit, prices and salary levels with 
the humane goal of allowing salaried Hondurans of enjoying a 
better lifestyle; jointly establishing production and 
productivity goals to increase our country's capability to 
compete; and establishing fair and intelligent agreements on the 
procedures that will allow us to increase the offer of export 
products, both traditional and nontraditional. 
  I hope the renewed and renewing spirit of a moral revolution 
imbues all Hondurans with a spirit that, like a votive candle, 
keeps alive the faith, decision, and courage to struggle and 
attain new levels of development, prosperity for all, and the 
moralization of the state's actions. 
  All this can happen based on the firm conviction that only 
if 
we move forward, united, will we be able to overcome the 
obstacles we face, and only if there is fraternal solidarity 
will we be able to safeguard social peace and build a Honduras 
where equity and justice serve as the basis for prosperity. 
  Fellow countrymen, this message to the Honduran people 
discusses only big problems that we must tackle right now. I 
will address the country again in a few months with regard to 
other aspects of my administration. It is necessary for the 
people to be constantly aware of the country's situation, its 
direction, and the main problems to be resolved. Knowledgeable 
people can better contribute to their own well-being. 
  We are concluding the preparation of a plan to modernize the 
state and public administration. I will refer to this problem 
another time. In the 39 days of my administration, the moral 
revolution has been initiated. Positive steps, fundamental to 
the country's development, have been taken. The Supreme Court of 
Justice is composed of honest and competent professionals. The 
appointment of the nation's prosecutor general was a big step 
forward. The new style of governing has elicited respect in 
Honduras and for Honduras. 
  It is possible to move forward and to improve; it is 
possible 
to produce more and sell more; it is possible to begin 
eradicating hunger and illiteracy; it is possible to control 
corruption despite its many disguises; it is possible to live 
better. 
  All this is possible only if it is based on our own efforts 
as the prime mover of development. I greet the future with 
optimism. I am enjoying these first steps on our march toward a 
promising development. I know the people of Honduras will not 
fail. The president of Honduras will not fail either. Thank you.

  [Text] Senator Bernard Sansaricq has reacted to the 
position of the U.S. spokesman on the conflict in the Senate. 
Senator Sansaricq warned the American diplomat against 
interference in Haiti's affairs. Bernard Sansaricq accused the 
U.S. spokesman of trying to stir up the crisis in parliament for 
unknown reasons: 
  [Begin Sansaricq recording] The office especially reminds 
Mr. 
Schrager of the formal provisions of Article 41 of the Vienna 
Convention and of Article 56 of the Haitian Constitution. 
Furthermore, the office makes a point of comparing the 
intentions of the nation with those of the international 
community, wrongly informed that in compliance with Article 108 
of the Constitution, the Upper Chamber has definitively solved 
the problem of the 18 January elected senators who resumed their 
activities as full senators and whose powers have been validated. 
  The assembly of senators has indeed overwhelmingly decided 
to 
contest that matter: 
  1. By denouncing the New York pact. 
  2. By dismissing the office [not further identified] 
irregularly acclaimed on 10 August 1993 under direct pressure by 
Dante Caputo and Leandro Despuy. 
  As a consequence, the office would like the immediate 
suspension of all insinuations, statements, or provocations that 
worsen the situation of conflict for the benefit of unrevealed 
interests. 
  [Signed] Bernard Sansaricq, president of the Senate. [end

  [Text] Washington, 13 Mar (EFE) -- Following his meeting 
with U.S. President Bill Clinton today -- Sunday, 13 March -- 
Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle underscored the 
importance of the upcoming "Summit of the Americas," which he 
believes will be a "meeting of nations rather than of 
governments." 
  Lacalle termed his meeting with Clinton -- his first ever -- 
as "brief, but all in all, most satisfactory." 
  During a news conference later, the Uruguayan head of state 
commented that the "scope" of Clinton's letter convening the 
Miami summit next December is unprecedented because 
"nongovernmental interest groups are invited to participate and 
hold meetings." 
  He said: "If integration between intermediate sectors of our 
society is achieved between now and December, the summit will be 
a meeting of nations, to which governments will contribute by 
applying the political and legal wrappings to something prepared 
from the grassroots." 
  Lacalle praised Clinton's idea of relating the struggle to 
"achieve prosperity with the strengthening of the democratic 
system in the entire western hemisphere." 
  He said he was convinced that "even though the GATT trade 
talks unfortunately failed to meet all our expectations, I have 
no doubt whatsoever that trade links between countries of the 
hemisphere will be strengthened." 
  "The integration of the Americas will be achieved in due 
time 
-- perhaps not in the near future, but certainly in the 
foreseeable future," he said. To attain this, it is important 
to "further the parallel development of integration processes 
like the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and NAFTA." 
  Lacalle praised Clinton's endeavors, as he "campaigned for 
NAFTA with intelligence, boldness, and zeal -- which met with 
Latin American approval." 
  The head of state declined to discuss who his country will 
vote for at the forthcoming elections for the OAS General 
Secretariat. 
  "Uruguay will not voice its opinion. We have already 
decided, but we would rather not make it public until we are 
further enlightened through future negotiations," he noted. 
  The president stated that Uruguay is in favor of settling 
the 
issue by consensus rather than having an all-out struggle at the 
polls. He believes the new secretary general will thus have 
greater support. 
  Regarding the possibility of Cuba joining the OAS, Lacalle 
said: "Unless the Cuban Government changes its position," this 
is most unlikely. 
  Lastly, commenting on the elections that will soon be held 
in 
his country, the head of state said: "There is special interest 
in hearing the proposals of the opposition because the proposals 
we submitted to Congress concerning state-owned enterprises and 
health care were voted down." 
  Concerning the government's economic policy, Lacalle 
asserted 
that the important "adjustments" implemented were always 
accompanied by "a far-reaching social policy." 
  Lacalle is on a private visit to Washington, where he will 
be 
presented with an award by the AIPAC [American Israel Public 
Affairs Committee] (a pro-Israel lobby that gives annual awards 
to people who champion the cause of Israel and the Jewish 
people).

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Mexican elections 
scheduled for 21 August 1994. 
  On 3 March, Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate for 
the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), urged opposition 
candidates not to use their campaigns to divide Mexicans. 
During a visit to Nayarit, Colosio stated: "I want to be 
president of Mexico to lead the change and transformation of 
social conditions in our motherland." (Mexico City Canal 13 
Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 3 March 94) 
  Colosio officially has registered his presidential candidacy 
with the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE). Commenting on 
rumors Peace Commissioner Camacho Solis might run as the PVEM 
candidate, he has said: "I have great respect for Manuel 
Camacho. We are members of a party committed to democracy. I 
have great respect for him, and I support his actions in the 
Chiapas peace talks. I believe the pluralistic nature of our 
modern political parties is a product of Mexican society." 
(Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 5 March 94) 
  Members of the Permanent Indian Council, a group that 
comprises almost half of the 56 ethnic groups in Mexico and has 
no affiliation with the PRI, visited Luis Colosio on 7 March. 
The Indians said their urgent needs and extreme poverty drove 
them to seek support from the PRI candidate. (Mexico City Radio 
ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 8 Mar 94) 
  Colosio promised on 7 March if elected he will "establish a 
new pact between the state and 56 ethnic communities to 
guarantee respect for human dignity, autonomous rights, legal 
and social justice, and democracy for 10 million Indians, who 
are part of the poorest of the poor." Colosio also said: "It is 
time to do justice to our Indians, to grow and share the fruits 
of that growth more equitably in our motherland, because 
progress makes no sense if it does not imply more income for the 
peasants, workers, and the Indian families of all and each one 
of our communities." (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 8 Mar 
94 pp 48, 52) 
  Colosio has announced he will recommend to his party women's 
participation be doubled in the PRI proposal of congressional 
candidates. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 
GMT 9 Mar 94) 
  Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, presidential candidate for the 
Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party, has 
officially registered his presidential candidacy. Aguilar has 
said he would be willing to decline his candidacy in favor of 
Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) Subcommander Marcos. 
(Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 4 March 94) 
  Commenting on the peace talks in San Cristobal de las Casas, 
National Action Party (PAN) presidential candidate Diego 
Fernandez has said: "I hope that efforts by the guerrillas, the 
government, the mediators, and society in general truly lead to 
a national de jure state and thus to a Mexico free of lies." 
(Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 4 March 94) 
  In Campeche, Fernandez has said: "We will never favor 
violence. We understand the Chiapas guerrilla movement has 
justifiable causes, but violence will never give us the peace, 
prosperity, and justice Mexico wants and deserves." He has also 
said: "The big challenge this country is facing, the big 
project to which all Mexicans should commit is so simple and 
deep that it can be expressed in a few words: The challenge 
modern-day Mexico faces is to comply with the law." (Mexico 
City XEW Television Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 7 Mar 94) 
  In Quintana Roo, Fernandez has praised the results of the 
peace talks in Chiapas, saying: "Other countries have not 
achieved over many years what Mexico has now accomplished, 
thanks to the government's prudence." (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 5 Mar 94) 
  In Hidalgo, Fernandez has said: "If the people, if millions 
of Mexicans participate cleanly in these elections, we will 
leave behind on 21 August a history of corruption, fraud, 
deception, lies, and we can welcome a true democracy." (Mexico 
City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 9 Mar 94) 
  During the weekend of 5 March, the PRD registered officially 
before the IFE Cuauhtemoc Cardenas as its presidential 
candidate. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 1300 
GMT 7 March 94) 
  Cardenas has said he will propose an end to the import of 
farm products, which have harmed Mexican peasants, if he is 
elected president. Cardenas has added what farmers need are 
credits, participation, and opportunities to produce, as well as 
protection against unfair competition from imported low-priced 
farm products. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 8 March 94 
pp 48, 52) 
  Cardenas has reiterated his demand of an independent 
electoral authority, saying the current electoral law can still 
be reformed. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 
GMT 9 March 94) 
  During a visit to Guadalajara, Alvaro Perez Trevino, 
presidential candidate for the Authentic Party of the Mexican 
Revolution, has denied he will decline his candidacy in favor of 
Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis. Perez Trevino has 
said: "We have not talked about this with Mr. Camacho Solis; we 
did not even know he was in charge of the peace talks in 
Chiapas. It is all a terrible rumor." He added he will register 
officially his candidacy on 11 March. (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 8 March 94) 
  Labor Party presidential candidate Cecilia Soto has rejected 
the presence of international observers during the 21 August 
elections. Soto has said Mexicans are able to solve their 
internal problems without observers. (Mexico City Canal 13 
Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 4 March 94) 
  Soto has said: "We cannot be frugal with democracy. Social 
peace in Mexico will be at stake if these elections are not 
satisfactory; therefore, we should do all we can for these 
elections to run as smoothly as possible." (Mexico City Radio 
ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 9 March 94) 
  Jorge Gonzalez Torres, presidential candidate for the 
Mexican 
Green Ecologist Party (PVEM), has met with EZLN peasants and 
urged them to work together to solve Chiapas' agricultural 
problems. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in 
Spanish 1300 GMT 4 March 94) 
  Gonzalez has said there should be bilingual teachers so 
residents of areas where Indian dialects are spoken can learn in 
their native language. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in 
Spanish 0435 GMT 8 March 94) 
  In Sinaloa, National Opposition Union presidential candidate 
Pablo Madero has expressed his satisfaction with the opening of 
the congressional special sessions and indicated this is the 
only way to achieve truly democratic electoral reform. (Mexico 
City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 4 
March 94) 
  Madero has reiterated the need to reform electoral laws. In 
Ciudad Obregon, he has said: "It is urgent that electoral 
bandits be punished without any right to bail." He has said he 
would fight impunity and corruption in the government if elected 
president. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 
GMT 8 March 94) 
  Marcela Lombardo, presidential candidate for the Popular 
Socialist Party (PSP), has expressed her discontent with the 
decision by the PAN candidate to hold televised debates with 
only the PRI and the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). She 
has said conditions should have been established to make debates 
all-inclusive. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network 
in Spanish 1300 GMT 4 March 94) 
  Five of the nine presidential candidates have registered 
officially their candidacies thus far. Lombardo registered her 
candidacy on 9 March. Lombardo said strengthening our 
institutions and democracy is the only way to resolve the 
crisis. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 
9 March 94) 
  On 6 March, the PRD's fifth plenum voted against holding 
internal elections to choose its candidates for deputies, 
senators, and assembly people, considering no political 
conditions exist "to preclude friction and erosion of members' 
unity." The plenum decided to focus on the presidential 
campaign. The party's national council decided during a 
closed-door meeting the positions in question would first be 
decided by state councils and executive committees. If disputes 
arise, the national council will have the final word. (Mexico 
City LA JORNADA in Spanish 7 March 94 p 11)

<F P=106> [Report by Isabel Becerril] </F>
  [Text] Jaime Serra Puche, secretary of commerce and 
industrial development, reported that the manufacturing sector 
has grown 3.4 percent and the economy 2.9 percent annually over 
the past five years. He added that the economic recession hit 
bottom in the last quarter and that the economic recovery has 
now begun. 
  Serra Puche said the price index decreased 17 percent 
between 
1987 and 1992 as a result of the economic opening. He also 
reported that between 1989 and 1992, labor productivity 
increased by 6 percent annually, a higher rate than that 
observed in the United States. 
  Exports of manufactured products grew more than 225 percent 
from 1985 to 1993. In the countries known as the Asian Tigers, 
the increase was 170 percent. 
  According to Serra Puche, such results show that 
considerable 
progress has been made. "But we cannot stop here. We must 
consolidate those achievements and continue to make the efforts 
that microeconomic reforms entail," he stressed. 
  Speaking to Mexican industrialists, Serra Puche said the 
country's productive sectors must fully assume their respective 
roles in accomplishing this task. 
  The government, he said, should see that reforms are 
implemented at the federal, state, and municipal levels. 
Productive sectors must do their part by striving to modernize 
and increase competitiveness. 
  Serra Puche added that attaining superior levels of 
competitiveness is a permanent and unavoidable task of all 
nations which, like Mexico, are committed to affirming their 
sovereignty, promoting growth, and substantially improving the 
welfare of the majority. 
  He said that the experiences of all countries confirm that 
competitiveness is the only way to ensure the economic growth 
that will allow a better distribution of income and the 
satisfaction of housing, health, education, training, 
investment, and employment needs in the long term. 
  He stressed that those are the real demands of social groups 
striving to overcome backwardness and neglect and to join modern 
life. 
  Serra Puche noted, however, that lasting solutions to just 
social demands will only be found by eliminating the obstacles 
to sustained progress in competitiveness and employment. It is 
therefore urgent, he said, that productive sectors redouble 
their efforts to give all Mexicans broad opportunities for 
personal development and individual and collective improvement. 
  In summarizing his ministry's actions to benefit the 
industrial sector, Serra Puche said that the office in charge of 
fighting illegal practices issued more than 157 antidumping 
resolutions in 1993. The resolutions can be broken down as 
follows: 82 in the initial phase of the investigation; 40 
provisional resolutions; and 18 final resolutions, five which 
have been appealed and 12 of which were dismissed. 
  He also noted that Nafin [National Financial Bank] funds 
totaling 11 billion new pesos have been channeled to benefit 
more than 22,500 companies in various sectors. Bancomext, 
[National Foreign Trade Bank] also issued credits for more than 
24 billion new pesos benefiting 5,300 companies. 
  Serra Puche said deregulation programs will continue and 
will 
be strengthened at the federal level. He added that in the last 
pact it was agreed to ask state governments to pay special 
attention to deregulation measures, particularly those regarding 
requirements for opening and operating companies and for cargo 
transportation and fares. 
  In the financial area, the secretary said that efforts were 
made from the outset to grant credits to small and medium 
enterprises. For that purpose, business cards were issued, 
specific lines of credit were created, and other special 
mechanisms were established. 
  The active interest rate, in real terms, remains high, and 
in 
that sense the financial situation continues to be a matter of 
concern for small and medium Mexican enterprises. Nafin, 
however, is making great efforts to confront the problem.

<F P=106> [Report by Claudia Olguin; from the "Analysis" supplement] </F>
  [Text] As a result of industrial inspections along the 
country's northern border, the Federal Attorney's Office for 
Environmental Protection [Procuraduria Federal de Proteccion al 
Ambiente] has temporarily or partially closed more than 121 
companies in the region, and it has permanently shut down more 
than 22, according to official reports obtained by the EL 
FINANCIERO Satellite News Service (Finsat). 
  Likewise, the latest report states 799 companies in the 
northern region of the country were subject to fines or 
penalties. 
  Studies conducted in this field indicate the effects of 
industrial development encouraged for 10 years along Mexico's 
border with the United States have resulted in severe basic 
infrastructure and environmental protection problems. 
  International organizations, such as the World Bank, granted 
several lines of credit for environmental projects in 1993. The 
line of credit granted by the World Bank stipulates that one of 
the two lines of credit granted $1.8 billion for regional 
environmental projects. 
  The Mexican and U.S. Governments came to the conclusion, 
however, the northern region needs $500 million to supply water, 
$2.8 million to treat municipal and industrial waste, $235 
million to treat solid waste, and $750 million to treat and 
eliminate toxic waste. 
  Approximately $277 million were appropriated last year for 
regional infrastructure projects. The amount is equivalent to a 
60.11-percent annual growth if compared to the 1992 budget. 
  The government budgeted $173 million two years ago to build 
facilities for the treatment of water, elimination of solid 
waste, highways and transportation, settlements, and human 
infrastructure. 
  In sum, the government spent $1.5 billion between 1991 and 
1993 to finance solutions to environmental problems caused by 
industrial development along the border. 
  The problems and backwardness in environmental technology, 
equipment, and information sectors, particularly evident at the 
country's northern border, are not new within an international 
context.

<F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] During a news conference held at approximately 1530 
in a Mexico City hotel, Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for 
peace in Chiapas, said he has kept his interests focused on the 
reconciliation efforts so far. He also said he had not thought 
about changing his political plans until he finishes this 
mission, but political pressures have forced him to change these 
plans. In this manner, Manuel Camacho Solis said he does not 
accept any criticism of the actions or work he has carried out 
as a public statesman. 
  [Begin Camacho Solis recording] It is being said that if 
Camacho makes a rival decision, he will accept the interests of 
the Institutional Revolutionary Party. No one, however, stops to 
consider that some of the programs he led in Mexico City 
continue to be supported by a majority in the federal district. 
I do not accept that some people want to make me a factor to 
explain the inefficiencies of others. Camacho has shown loyalty 
to the president of the republic, and he is [word indistinct] in 
the tasks that have been entrusted to him. [end recording] 
  Later on, the peace commissioner clarified doubts on what is 
being said regarding his possible candidacy to the president of 
the republic. 
  [Begin Camacho Solis recording] Camacho will not be a 
problem 
so the candidacies can comply with their responsibilities of 
consolidating their campaigns and of showing their effectiveness 
to the people. The opening has always been there. Something I am 
not willing to do is to stop fully exercising my citizen's 
rights. [end recording] 
  In conclusion, Manuel Camacho Solis reiterated his decision 
to continue fighting to strengthen the democratic system in 
Mexico, and he emphasized that is his commitment. 
  [Begin Camacho Solis recording] I am not going to act under 
pressure or hastily. My task is to contribute to unity and to 
participate in the democratic transition of Mexico. What is the 
best way to do that? To be effectively loyal to the nation? That 
is the question. 
  One path that I think is the most advisable for today, is if 
everyone would support the IFE [Federal Electoral Institute] and 
COFIPE [Federal Code of Institutions and Electoral Procedures] 
reforms in such a way that the Agreement for Peace, Justice, and 
Democracy, which the political parties and presidential 
candidates signed, is duly observed, and if conditions are right 
so I can contribute to the guarantee of the democratic 
transition. After I fulfill my mission in Chiapas, my role will 
be to support the democratic transition in Mexico and to defend 
its results. 
  Another path is that if there is no progress toward 
democracy, if instead of agreements there is polarization, and 
if there is an effort to violate my rights as a citizen, then, 
after concluding my mission in Chiapas, I will make the 
necessary political decision for progress toward democracy and 
the promotion of Mexico's unity. 
  Nothing is more important to me than to maintain and 
strengthen Mexico's unity. There cannot be unity if one has to 
forgo interests; unity is derived by feeling confident about 
legitimate interests and by opening the doors of institutions to 
the demands of justice by Mexican society and people. In other 
words, a unity that does not exclude, but rather one that is 
based on peace, justice, and democracy. 
  That is my stand and that is the field in which I will work. 
Camacho will be a factor of reconciliation and stability, and he 
will be a useful component in the democratic transition. As I 
have done since 10 January, as of this moment, I am completely 
focused on my task of seeking peace in Chiapas. [end recording]

  [Begin Aguilar recording] Today more than ever, and after

the 21 August elections. With those illuminating statements he 
is asking the homeland to pay for services rendered and 
recognize him as a savior. He said this country will be 
democratized and that it will overcome its difficulties. We do 
not need transition governments. We need stable, constitutional 
governments that will govern for everyone. That is why I will 
repeat that Camacho showed his true colors today during the news 
conference. He showed himself to be a real fire-eater [traga

Palace. Beware. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Jorge Octavio Ochoa] </F>
  [Text] Without any scruples or modesty, U.S. leaders 
attempt to take advantage of the current and future events in 
Mexico (such as the elections in August, the Chiapas conflict, 
and the illegal alien problem) to gain better political 
positions and more votes from their voters. 
  Rodolfo Bacerril Suaffron, president of the Chamber of 
Deputies Foreign Relations Committee, yesterday warned that the 
attempt to create an institution that would engage the northern 
neighbor in a "parallel count" of our elections would not only 
"confuse' the work of the international media, it is insulting 
and disrespectful to our government. 
  In all this series of "new attitudes" regarding serious 
problems such as illegal aliens, and internal matters, such as 
the elections, one can clearly see political interests by the 
opportunistic forces that are only seeking votes, alerted Jorge 
Tovar Montanez from the Popular Socialist Party. 
  Bucerril Straffon, who was interviewed separately, said 
quite 
annoyed that the mere pretension is "insulting" and demeaning 
because no nation can assume the right to create institutions to 
become the overseer of electoral rights, of human rights, and of 
the political rights of another nation. 
  But the worst part, he said, is that many of these proposals 
have been made by unscrupulous politicians who want to use 
whatever conflicts exist in Mexico to create trouble. 
  Tovar Montanez said that this is just one of the actions 
that 
the neighboring country is beginning to carry out to create 
signs of increased feelings of hostility in U.S. society toward 
Mexicans in an effort to justify its economic setbacks. 
  This announcement, together with the one about carrying out 
military exercises at the border near Ciudad Juarez, are events 
without precedent that are part of a global policy of meddling, 
the legislator said. 
  He stated: "Now they are announcing that in July there will 
be a meeting with the chiefs of state of the rest of America to 
discuss the suitability of structuring a military peace force 
for democracy and in defense of human rights. This is a very 
worrisome situation." 
  He concluded by saying that on the one hand they propose 
militarization and erecting metal walls, and on the other they 
want to supervise the domestic electoral process in the country 
of people whose human rights are criminally violated every day, 
and every time there is an illegal crossing of the border. This 
is a contradiction, he affirmed.

  [Text] The Government of Baja California is offering a 
reward to anyone who gives information on Ismael Higuera 
Guerrero, alias El Mayel, an heir of the Tijuana Cartel, which 
controls drug trafficking activities in the area. 
  Governor Ernesto Ruffo Appel said that authorities are 
searching for Higuera Guerrero, a lieutenant of the Areliano 
Felix brothers, well-known drug trafficking bosses in the city 
of Tijuana, for his involvement in a shoot-out on 3 March in 
which four people were killed. The Baja California governor did 
not mention the amount of the reward, which will be discussed at 
the state's congress. 
  The Attorney General's Office [PGR] said yesterday that the 
best U.S. and Mexican narcotics agents will be part of a special 
group to fight drug trafficking activities on the border between 
the countries, where tons of drugs circulate. 
  Ruffo pointed out that Higuera is a key element in the 
shoot-out that took place between federal and state agents in a 
Tijuana shopping center, which resulted in four persons being 
killed, including Alejandro Castaneda, chief of the Federal 
Judicial Police [PJF]. Five agents were also injured in the 
incident. 
  According to the PGR, the shoot-out occurred when state 
agents and a Lebanese gunman were providing protection to Ismael 
Higuera Guerrero, well-known drug trafficking boss from that 
border city. The PGR added that the incident took place when 
members of the State Judicial Police (PJE) were escorting Ismael 
Higuera Guerrero, alias El Mayel, in a vehicle. 
  The PJF, which is investigating the activities of the 
Tijuana 
Cartel, initiated the pursuit of a vehicle in which El Mayel was 
allegedly traveling, which led the state judicial agents to 
shoot at the federal agents. 
  The Lebanese gunman, an unidentified man, Castaneda, and a 
PJE member who was protecting the alleged drug trafficker, were 
killed in the shoot-out. 
  The PGR said that the assistant state attorney general, 
Sergio Ortiz Lara, and the state prosecutor for special affairs 
were arrested by the federal authorities for their alleged 
responsibility in the incidents. According to the PGR, Ortiz 
ordered the federal agents to turn over to him one of the 
alleged drug traffickers, who was arrested following the 
shoot-out but was later released. 
  Even though Ortiz claims he is innocent, the PGR has 
denounced the involvement of certain state judicial police 
members with the drug traffickers, which could explain why the 
Areliano Felix brothers have not been arrested yet. Governor 
Ruffo Appel said he believes Orti is innocent because he says he 
has known him since childhood and he had no reason to get 
involved in drug trafficking activities.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Oversight Is Unacceptable"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday we informed our readers about another 
hostile position adopted by the U.S. Congress which, hiding 
behind AID, "expects to conduct a parallel and independent vote 
count during the presidential elections in Mexico." In light of 
this intention to oversee the elections, six parties represented 
in the Chamber of Deputies have unanimously condemned this sham. 
Legislators of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, the 
National Action Party, the Party of the Democratic Revolution, 
the Popular Socialist Party, the Cardenist Front for National 
Reconstruction Party, and the Authentic Party of the Mexican 
Revolution have not hesitated to point out that "it is one thing 
to accept foreign observers -- because, whether or not we like 
it, the eyes of the world will be upon Mexico -- but it is 
another thing to accept meddling by another nation." 
  The legislators' opposition to this move is legitimate. It 
is not possible to let the United States supervise our 
government, especially now that our government has made much 
progress in guaranteeing transparency in the elections. If the 
dependability of our electoral registry is as good or better 
than that of the U.S. electoral registry, if our election 
materials possess features that make them practically 
unforgeable, if steps have been taken to create a tribunal in 
charge of investigating electoral crimes, and if the presence of 
international observers is being permitted as long as these 
observers do not belong to or sympathize with any of Mexico's 
political parties, then any parallel vote-counting by another 
nation is unacceptable. What will be decided and done by the 
Mexicans can only be overseen by the Mexicans. 
  With this in mind, the position of U.S. AID and the U.S. 
House of Representatives Budget Committee makes no sense. Here, 
however, the situation that is emerging could be similar to that 
created by Representative Torricelli, who, armed with the sword 
of xenophobia, has launched himself against Mexico on many 
occasions. This type of attitude cannot be tolerated from a 
country that claims, at least in its public pronouncements, that 
it is a friend of Mexico. 
  Only two options are valid in the face of the sham being 
planned by AID and some members of the U.S. House of 
Representatives. One would be that the U.S. Congress recant and 
apologize to our Chamber of Deputies. The other is that the 
government of Bill Clinton allow the Mexicans to oversee the 
forthcoming U.S. elections in order that we may show the United 
States how to hold absolutely clean elections.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Manuel Alvarado and Ignacio Nunez] </F>
  [Text] Somewhere in the jungle (Chiapas) -- Subcommander 
Marcos has said the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] has 
not reached any agreement or negotiated peace with Peace 
Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis; it has only participated in a 
dialogue. He noted that, although the peace commissioner for 
peace and reconciliation in Chiapas and Bishop Samuel Ruiz, 
mediator in the talks, have both said agreements, pacts, and 
understandings have been reached through negotiations, this is 
not true. 
  "The problem the (Indian Revolutionary Clandestine) 
Committee 
[CCRI] sees is that the government is saying agreements or pacts 
have already been reached, that an agreement was reached as a 
result of the dialogue in San Cristobal de las Casas, and that 
the only thing pending is its ratification, which is false," 
said subcommander Marcos, who headed the EZLN delegation at the 
negotiations. 
  "The committee simply appointed delegates to participate in 
a 
dialogue, not to negotiate. We attended the dialogue, presented 
the demands from the members of our organization, and received a 
reply. Based on that reply, the committee must decide the next 
step. 
  During an interview granted at an EZLN camp in the jungle, 
Subcommander Marcos said this confusion has delayed 
consultations with the Indian grass roots organizations. He 
added that creating false expectations about peace would not be 
fair. "It would seem that the only thing pending for a peace 
agreement is a signature, which is not the case. Peace is 
further away than one could imagine," he added. 
  He said the CCRI members will study the EZLN proposals and 
the peace commissioner's replies in the next few days. Then, 
they will evaluate both and will begin consultations in order to 
reach a consensus. Subcommander Marcos said the committee will 
also evaluate the delegates' conduct, and if anyone acted 
improperly he will be punished. 
  "That is the most serious problem right now. There have been 
no agreements or negotiations," he said. The government has 
presented it in this way with the obvious intention of forcing 
us up against the wall and accepting it." 
  When the dialogue meeting ended at the San Cristobal 
Cathedral, both Bishop Ruiz and Camacho Solis announced that 32 
agreements had been reached, which only had to be ratified in 
order to sign a peace agreement. "This means that if the (EZLN) 
committees say they disagree with the reply or part of it, it 
will seem as though we are intractable, which could be their 
purpose," he stressed. 
  Asked why, contrary to the peace commissioner and the 
mediator, he looked upset the day advancements on the dialogue 
were announced. "We were upset by the way in which the situation 
was being presented, as if peace only depended on a signature, 
and that it was just a matter of having a few meetings," Marcos 
noted. "We were upset because throughout the dialogue we 
stressed the fact that we had no power of decision or 
negotiation, and this could create problems for us with our 
leaders. The problem was that we did not want to create false 
expectations in the civilian society. [no closing quotation 
marks as published] 
  "People could get the impression that an agreement had been 
reached, that the path toward peace was completely open, which 
could cause people to lower their guards or give up. We believe 
there are unfavorable conditions preventing a solution to the 
conflict. I am talking about other factors." 
  He warned that one of the factors that could extend the 
conflict is the aggressiveness of cattlemen and landowners. 
"Another factor is the way the government has handled the talks, 
giving the impression that everything has been settled," he 
added. "I am upset by the federal government's attitude, which 
gives the appearance of charity. I am disgusted with government 
leaders who are not complying with their duties of satisfying 
demands or organizing things correctly instead of conducting 
actions that seem charitable," he said. 
  Asked why he did not clarify the situation when a report was 
presented to the domestic and international journalists at the 
Cathedral, when the mediator also implied that the next step 
would be the signing of the peace agreement, he replied: "The 
signals you give to the peace process is very important. 
Therefore, if we insisted too much on that point, we could be 
portraying a warmonger attitude, and some people would say: They 
really do not want peace; they want war. 
  "We are letting the process continue according to our logic 
and our time. We did, however, make it clear to the mediator 
and the peace commissioner that no agreements had been signed."

  [Text] According to Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, the second 
stage of the talks for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas will 
start in about two weeks. The purpose of this second stage is to 
sign the peace agreements. 
  Ruiz has been in the headlines because of the death threats 
he has received and the demands of certain San Cristobal de las 
Casas conservative groups' that Ruiz leave the San Cristobal de 
las Casas diocese. Ruiz said the meetings with the EZLN rank and 
file are in depth and serious. If this is so, the delegates 
would return in two weeks and the beginning of the talks would 
be announced 24 hours beforehand.

  [Text] Mexico City, 11 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- A Zapatist 
National Liberation Army [EZLN] spokesman said that the EZLN has 
reportedly begun consultations at the grass roots level 
regarding commitments made with the Mexican Government during 
the peace talks held in San Cristobal de las Casas. 
  Major Mario told local and international media that the EZLN 
talks have reportedly taken place at La Garrocha ranch and the 
Pathuitz ejido, located 30 and 40 km away from San Miguel, in 
Chiapas. Mario added that the EZLN Indian Revolutionary 
Clandestine Committee-General Command and Subcommander Marcos 
will reportedly lead the consultations with representatives of 
Indian and peasant communities nationwide. 
  During the consultations the EZLN and the Indian and peasant 
representatives will accept or reject the commitments made with 
the government to improve their living standards. 
  On 1 January the EZLN occupied four cities in the Chiapas 
highlands as they violently demanded solutions to the social 
hardships of Indians. The EZLN violent actions forced the 
Mexican Army to intervene. 
  At the end of February the EZLN and Manuel Camacho Solis, 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, reached a 
34- point agreement to restore peace in Chiapas. This agreement 
must be ratified by the EZLN rank and file.

<F P=106> [Report by Betzy Villarreal and Juan de Dio Garcia Davish] </F>
  [Text] Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno has 
acknowledged a climate of tension prevails in this state and 
denied his government had any involvement in the murder of 
Mariano Perez Diaz, leader of the Emiliano Zapata Peasant 
Organization (OCEZ). He has also announced a special 
prosecutor's office was created to investigate the murder, 
reiterating "our hands our clean." 
  In San Cristobal de las Casas, residents of the 
municipality's poorest areas created a Unity Civic Front [Frente 
Civico de Unidad] in support of Father Samuel Ruiz Garcia, the 
diocese's bishop and mediator in the armed conflict. In Tuxtla 
Gutierrez, more than 5,000 people participated in a rally 
organized by PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] municipal 
leaders and Municipal Council President Julio Cesar Garcia to 
demand peace in Chiapas. 
  Meanwhile, the Zapatista National Liberation Army [EZLN] 
began consultations with its grass roots regarding the 
agreements reached with Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for 
peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, during the so-called 
meetings for peace. Since 9 March representatives of different 
Altos de Chiapas communities have been going to the towns of La 
Garrucha and Pantehuitz, Ocosingo Municipality, to participate 
in the consultation to accept or reject the commitments the 
federal government has made in San Cristobal Cathedral. 
  Antonio Hernandez, a member of the State Council of Indian 
and Peasant Organizations (CEOIC), has said the group will ask 
for the abolition of the state government and the promotion of a 
provisional pact with the federal government to propose the 
overhauling of the state's territorial and political structure. 
Hernandez, who is also a state leader of the CIOAC [Independent 
Federation of Agricultural Workers and Peasants], has said: 
"They tell us we are crazy for making this proposal, but there 
is no other alternative due to the current Chiapas government's 
incapacity and lack of political commitment, something that was 
borne out during our march of 6 March when the governor refused 
to meet with us and sent us the police." 
  The state governor praised publicly Mariano Perez Diaz, who 
was an OCEZ leader in Chiapas' northern zone, and he denied the 
existence of a "witch hunt" or that a prize has been put on the 
head of anyone. "The masterminds and perpetrators of this crime 
will be punished in accordance to the law. This is an act of 
provocation," he has affirmed. In a ceremony held at the 
auditorium of the Government Palace in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Lopez 
Moreno has urged state residents "against affixing lightly blame 
beforehand or being prejudiced. Nobody will succeed in 
separating the state government from local Indian organizations." 
  In Simojovel, where Perez Diaz was buried, the governor has 
announced the creation of a special prosecutor's office, which 
the CEOIC will name. The governor has said the murder was 
regrettable, because Perez Diaz was an outstanding social 
activist. With Margarita Ruiz de Perez, widow of the peasant 
leader, present, Lopez Moreno has said his administration is 
opening its doors, because there is nothing to hide. There has 
been no complicity or illicit interests. 
  Relatives of the deceased peasant leader have said Simojovel 
Council President Francisco Meneses Bassoul paid gunmen to kill 
Perez Diaz. They have also said there will be a march to demand 
justice and punishment for the masterminds and perpetrators of 
the crime. Mrs. Perez has said her husband had received death 
threats from Peasant Torch Oraganization and people from the 
village of Concepcion de los Cacaos, Simojovel Municipality, 
headed by his compadre, Sosimo Vasquez, with whom he had 
differences regarding land. 
  In San Cristobal de las Casas, a pro-Bishop Samuel Ruiz 
Garcia Unity Civic Front was created. The group has decided to 
remain united to oppose those who want the clergyman to leave. 
They have said the bishop has helped them more than any coleto 
(San Cristobal de las Casas native) and felt it was unfair to 
accuse him of being responsible for the problems that began on 1 
January. 
  PRI supporters from different low-income areas of the city 
have also held a demonstration in Tuxtla Gutierrez to protest 
what they regard as the "stamping on of the constitution" of the 
state. More than 5,000 people came out in favor of restoring 
peace in Chiapas. 
  CIOAC leader Hernandez has said the CEOIC will seek to meet 
with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to ask him to keep the 
commitments he made with the 280 groups that comprise that 
organization. He recalled later on 13 and 14 March the National 
Meeting of Indian and Peasant Organizations will meet in San 
Cristobal de las Casas to draft "a coordinated plan to demand 
the dissolution of the Chiapas government to establish a supreme 
government of Indians and non-Indians." 
  Domingo Lopez Angel, leader of the Community of People 
Expelled from Chiapas [Comunidad de Expulsados de Chiapas], has 
said his group will abstain from taking over additional state 
buildings as a gesture of goodwill to contribute to peace. 
  Meanwhile, peasant groups still control the municipal 
president's offices in Bella Vista and Sultepec in Chiapas 
Sierra Madre. The offices of the mayor of Tuzantan and Mazatan 
on the coast remain occupied. In those four cases, the 
protesters are demanding the dissolution of the local 
governments, because the mayors used public funds and did not 
carry out any projects.

<F P=106> [Interview with Luis Donaldo Colosio, Institutional </F>
Revolutionary Party presidential candidate, by unidentified 
reporter; date and place not given] 
  [Text] Mexico City (APRO) -- [EL NORTE] After (late 
President) Plutarco Elias Calles, a man from your hometown, 
began the maximato [the arrangement by which the former 
president influenced his nominal successor], other presidents 
attempted "minimaximatos," but they did not succeed because the 
presidents who followed them cut the umbilical cord. When will 
you cut yours? 
  [Colosio] I aspire to govern Mexico at the side of the 
Mexicans. Let me be clear: No one but the citizens and society 
will guide my work as president of Mexico. 
  [EL NORTE] President Salinas designated you as the candidate 
of the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], and he later 
ratified you by saying: "Let there be no confusion." Doesn't 
that weaken from the beginning the credibility you want to 
secure during your campaign? 
  [Colosio] I would like to tackle your question with two 
answers. First, regarding the PRI, I want to tell you that my 
nomination took place in accordance with my party's rules, 
customs, and traditions. All party members who aspire to be 
candidates accept those rules. My nomination received broad 
party support. 
  Regarding my credibility as a candidate, I want to tell you 
that it is an objective of my campaign, and I intend to win the 
trust, support, and confidence of the citizens. I have the best 
platform to achieve results. I firmly believe that, which is 
why I have called for debates. 
  [EL NORTE] You have said that countries are not invented 
every six years. Does that mean Salinism will continue to rule 
in Mexico? 
  [Colosio] I must explain myself. I realize that the country 
and Mexican society need, want, and demand changes, but Mexicans 
want to make changes without going backward. Mexicans want to 
explore new roads, new opportunities, and new economic, 
political, and social approaches. But they want these things 
without jumping off a cliff, without political adventures. What 
the people want right now, at the end of the century in an 
increasingly complex world, is certainty, a real future, and 
responsibility. 
  [EL NORTE] Your admiration for Salinas is well known, but 
looking beyond your compliments in his favor, he can make 
mistakes. In your opinion, what errors has the president made in 
governing the country? 
  [Colosio] I do not believe in passing final judgment. The 
president and Mexicans have made a great effort to progress. 
Personally, we are united by great friendship and fondness. As 
part of the government, I, in my area of responsibilities, 
worked with him and shared commitments and objectives. I know 
that he has always been motivated by a great love for Mexico. I 
also know that some things can be done better. 
  It must be admitted that the government often does not do 
everything it would like to do but does what it can based on the 
available resources and the respect due to the citizens' 
liberties and rights. In government, intentions and realities 
always conflict, and difficult balancing acts result. 
  [EL NORTE] There will be a special period of congressional 
sessions to pass reforms guaranteeing electoral impartiality. 
Will this end the perfect dictatorship? 
  [Colosio] There will be a special period and an electoral 
reform if all political parties and all candidates agree to it. 
That was stated in the agreement that all the candidates signed 
on 27 January. I insist: We will go to the special period and 
pass legal reforms so long as this is preceded by an agreement 
among the parties and the candidates. This would, of course, 
contribute to a democratic transformation in Mexico. 
  I think everyone must place the interests of the nation 
above 
party or group interests. That is why I committed myself to 
compliance with that agreement. I am fully committed to it. 
  [EL NORTE] If you won such exemplary elections, would you 
be the product of a new political system? Would this be the end 
of the perfect dictatorship? 
  [Colosio] Wait a minute. It is important to speak of 
democracy all the time, not only when one wins. There are 
candidates and parties that speak of democracy only when they 
win. When they lose they say the elections were a fraud. I 
think we must promote trust among ourselves. Trust is very 
important these days. 
  [EL NORTE] Problems built up in Chiapas for centuries. 
Statesmen have the obligation of foreseeing violence and of 
warning the country about it. That was not done. How do you 
interpret this possible lack of foresight or imposed silence 
that was broken by the sound of gunfire on 1 January? 
  [Colosio] Lack of foresight and climactic situations 
resulting from shortages and limitations in those communities 
are two sides of the same coin. Cumulative abuse created a 
situation that could not be resolved with preventive actions. 
We must view this as a structural conflict that has taught the 
government, society, and -- why not admit it -- the PRI some 
lessons. 
  [EL NORTE] First as PRI president and later as social 
development secretary, you said nothing about a latent war in 
Chiapas for a long time. Were you unaware of what was happening 
there? How did you react on 1 January? If you were aware, why 
did you remain obstinately silent? 
  [Colosio] I visited Chiapas as social development secretary 
four months before the conflict. I met in Ocosingo and 
Margaritas with representatives from all regional organizations, 
all of which made known their loyalties and beliefs. They 
presented various demands, and we responded. The anguish and 
hopelessness of those communities tell us that we arrived too 
late. I admit that. 
  [EL NORTE] Why, if you are the candidate of hope, does hope 
not go to Chiapas? 
  [Colosio] I will go at the appropriate time and be among the 
people of Chiapas. But I will do it without acting against the 
negotiation process there. I condemned violence from the very 
beginning. I proposed that the various parties issue a joint 
communique. I have spoke of this on several occasions. 
  If you mean that I have not made Chiapas the central issue 
of 
my campaign, you're right. I will tell you this: My decision 
has been not to block, hinder, or interfere with the peace 
process. No party and no candidate must make Chiapas into 
political booty. I repeat: I will visit Chiapas. I will look 
for the best time to do that. 
  [EL NORTE] [Former Chiapas State Governor] Absalon 
Castellanos and [Interior Secretary] Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido 
have been accused of illegal enrichment and repression in 
Chiapas. The Zapatist National Liberation Army has demanded that 
they face political trial. What is your position? 
  [Colosio] I believe in the law. There are ways to denounce 
and punish crimes. I am in favor of abiding by the law. If the 
people you have mentioned are guilty, let them be punished, but 
I do not agree with condemning people based on unsubstantiated 
accusations. 
  [EL NORTE] Castellanos and Gonzalez Garrido are 
"distinguished PRI members." Does the PRI owe the country an 
explanation? Will PRI's Honor and Justice Commission finally 
function? 
  [Colosio] They may or may not face the commission, depending 
of whether they are found guilty of the crimes of which they are 
accused. 
  [EL NORTE] The PRI would then have to give an explanation? 
(Colosio says nothing but nods) 
  [EL NORTE] The debate among the presidential candidates is 
turning out to be just a fantasy. What is going to happen? 
  [Colosio] I have proposed that the candidates hold a debate 
because I think that the more people of voting age are informed, 
the freer they will be to choose among the various platforms and 
proposals present in the national political spectrum. The 
debate must mean more information available to the citizens, 
information provided live to them by the candidates. 
  I propose two dates for the debates, one at the end of April 
and another at the end of June. I have proposed that the 
debates he held at the Federal Electoral Institute.

<F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, presidential 
candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], has 
received support from PRI legislators in the Senate and the 
Chamber of Deputies, as well as from the representatives to the 
Assembly of the Federal District. Colosio said in a speech that 
the PRI's road in becoming a more autonomous party does not mean 
that war has to be declared on the government, as some may be 
asking for or as some have interpreted. Colosio made the 
statement in clear reference to the speech he delivered on the 
occasion of the 65th anniversary of the PRI, which gathered the 
entire PRI family under the Monument to the Revolution here in 
Mexico City on Sunday morning. 
  Among many other important things, Colosio said in a speech 
that limits need to be placed on presidential government 
[presidencialismo] and that he fully supports change. He said 
he fully supports making deep changes in matters of democracy 
and that he believes the PRI should be separated from the 
government itself. Luis Donaldo Colosio said: If we want to 
exist as a party -- referring to the PRI -- our political 
initiative should serve as the main engine to keep us moving 
ahead by way of arguments and reason. 
  Speaking to PRI legislators and assembly members, Luis 
Donaldo Colosio said the decision to make his party more 
independent from the government is not a declaration of war but, 
rather, a way of guaranteeing that the party will remain a 
viable organization in terms of electoral competition. Speaking 
to PRI candidates, Colosio asked them to join him in embracing 
this change. He said they should not fear debate and the 
confrontation of ideas or electoral competition. He said the 
government will not give us victory in the 21 August elections. 
  [Begin Colosio recording] What does this autonomy of which I 
spoke about on Sunday and today mean? It does not mean 
declaring war on the government, like some would like or some 
have interpreted -- of course not. What we want with the 
government is a political dialogue, just as we want a dialogue 
with other political parties. We want a clear differentiation of 
what will be the government's role and what will be the role of 
the political party to which we belong. [end recording] 
  Luis Donaldo Colosio said the government must guarantee 
impartiality, objectivity, and firmness in applying the law, but 
the PRI has to work toward becoming closer to society and 
becoming a social leader. He said political competition is 
needed to put an end to self-indulgence, comfort, and conformity. 
  Speaking to the people's representatives headed by Senator 
Emilio Gonzalez Parra, Deputy Maria de los Angeles Moreno, and 
Assembly member Juan Jose Osorio Palacios, he asked them to 
work, sacrifice, and be willing to change. This is the only way 
to gain the people's trust. Colosio also reminded them that 
they had emerged from an election, the 1991 elections, in which 
certain beliefs were discarded, such as that the PRI could never 
win when there is high voter turnout. 
  Luis Donaldo Colosio delivered a clear message to the 
deputies and senators. He asked them to spread the word on 
their legislative actions and to show that the legislative 
branch has fulfilled its promises with Mexico. 
  At the end of the meeting, PRI senators and assembly members 
gave their support to Luis Donaldo Colosio in the 21 August 
presidential elections. During the gathering at the central 
esplanade at the PRI's National Executive Committee Building, 
the deputies and senators gave their solidarity and support to 
the PRI candidate.

  [Text] With the 20 March elections so close, the UN 
Observers for El Salvador (Onusal) summoned the seven 
presidential candidates to sign a document in which they pledge 
to respect the results. In this document the candidates 
reaffirm their condemnation of the use of violence as a 
political weapon and urge their followers to behave peacefully. 
  Signing the declaration were Armando Calderon Sol of Arena 
[Nationalist Republican Alliance], Rhina Escalante de Rey 
Prendes of MAC [Authentic Christian Movement], Edgardo Rodriguez 
of Solidarity, Roberto Marchesini on behalf of Roberto Escobar 
Garcia of the PCN [National Conciliation Party], Jorge Martinez 
of the Unity Movement, Fidel Chavez Mena of the Christian 
Democratic Party, and Ruben Zamora of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front]. 
  The "Presidential Candidates Declaration," reads: 
  1. "We reiterate our firm condemnation of the use of 
violence, chiefly as a political weapon, and urge our supporters 
to behave peacefully and calmly during the few days remaining in 
the campaign. 
  2. "We reiterate our faith in democracy and, therefore, 
respect the sovereign decision of citizens freely expressed at 
the polls. 
  3. "We pledge to respect and enforce all the Peace 
Agreements, since they constitute a solid base for the future 
progress of our nation. 
  4. "We urge all Salvadoran citizens to participate in the 
20 March elections by going to the polls and casting their 
ballots freely for the candidates of their choice. 
  5. "We ask for strict compliance with the commitments 
signed in El Salvador's 14 departments among the political 
parties' representatives to conduct a lofty and respectful 
campaign. We reaffirm our joint declaration of 5 November 1993. 
  Afterward, Onusal chief Augusto Ramirez Ocampo said the 
latest incidents in the electoral campaign "are a normal thing 
as the electoral temperature rises." He urged the supporters of 
the different parties to remain calm. 
  Arena candidate Calderon Sol hoped all the candidates who 
signed the pact would abide by it out of respect for the 
Salvadoran people. He indicated his party has kept all the other 
agreements they signed, although others have not respected them. 
"I commend Mr. Ramirez Ocampo's initiative, and we are prepared 
to abide by them, although it is unfortunate that the 
traditional parties do not abide by what they signed," Rodriguez 
indicated. 
  Meanwhile, Ruben Zamora of the leftist coalition said he 
supported the pact. He also noted the campaign has been handled 
rather well, although he criticized some parties for conducting 
"a two-faced ad campaign, saying things they should not."

<F P=106> ["First of three debates" among presidential candidates </F>
Rhina Escalante de Rey Prendes of the Authentic Christian 
Movement; Ruben Zamora of the Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front-Democratic Convergence; Fidel Chavez Mena of 
the Christian Democratic Party; Edgardo Rodriguez Eigenhart of 
the National Solidarity Movement; and Roberto Escobar Garcia of 
the National Coalition Party; hosted by Mauricio Funes; in the 
station studios in San Salvador; monitored in progress -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Funes]....we truly regret that not all 
political parties understand the reason for these debates, and I 
hope they will be willing to present the people with their 
solutions to the country's problems. The chairs of the two 
candidates who did not come to this debate are empty. We thank 
the parties and candidates who did understand the need to debate 
and openly discuss their plans. 
  Today we begin the first of three debates with this subject: 
economic measures of the next administration during the first 
100 days in office. 
  Here today are Dr. Rhina Escalante de Rey Prendes, 
presidential candidate of the Authentic Christian Movement 
[MAC]; Dr. Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate of the Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front-Democratic Convergence [FMLN-CD] 
coalition; Dr. Fidel Chavez Mena, presidential candidate of the 
Christian Democratic Party [PDC]; Edgardo Rodriguez Eigenhart, 
presidential candidate of the National Solidarity Movement 
[MSN]; and Roberto Escobar Garcia, presidential candidate of the 
National Coalition Party [PCN]. We welcome you and thank you 
for responding to Canal Doce Television's invitation to debate 
and openly discuss your plans of action. To the two candidates 
who are not present here this morning, I hope you will watch the 
program and listen to the statements made here today. 
  The debate will be in three parts. During the first part of 
the program, each candidate will have five minutes to present 
his economic plan; that is, his economic plan for the first 100 
days in office. The speaking order was decided prior to the 
program by a drawing. Poll results have no bearing on the order 
of the speakers. During the second and third parts of the 
program, the candidates will discuss and comment on the programs 
presented. We invite listeners to call the studio -- the 
telephone number is 88-0309; it will be appearing on your screen 
-- and ask any question you may have for the candidates. 
  Our first speaker will be FMLN-CD presidential candidate 
Ruben Zamora. 
  I do have one question for all the candidates. If you were 
to become president of the Republic, what economic measures 
would you implement during your first 100 days in office? How 
will you confront the country's economic problems. The voters 
believe that the country's biggest problems continue to be 
unemployment, inflation, and poverty, among others. You have 
five minutes to answer. [39-second break in reception] 
  [Zamora] ....that we sit down and draft a basic agenda for 
the country's economic development, establish what is and what 
will be the framework of this agreement, and decide on basic 
policies for investment, employment, and wages in El Salvador. 
  Second, and based on this agreement among the various 
sectors, I suggest a renegotiation of the conditions of the 
foreign debt. Based on the new boost we will give the country, I 
will approach the U.S. Government, the World Bank, and the IMF 
to discuss the terms of our foreign debt to ensure that our 
domestic social debt will not continue to grow. I will also 
talk to the U.S. Government about the situation of our fellow 
countrymen in the United States and ask that they not be 
declared illegal. I will attempt to show that my government 
recognizes the role of foreign countries, but I will also make 
it known that Salvadorans will make the final decisions. 
  The third main topic we will broach will be financial 
policy. 
I will not devaluate our currency, but I will meet with the 
Central American presidents [eight-second break in reception] 
and too indiscriminate for our national production. I will not 
nationalize banks. Banks will continue to remain in private 
hands, but we will immediately do two things: First, we will 
reduce the current difference between interest rates paid for 
assets and those charged for liabilities. The difference is too 
great and does not contribute to the reactivation of the 
economy. Second, we are going to confront and immediately solve 
the agrarian debt problem. 
  The fourth main measure to be implemented in the first 100 
days in office is directed at unemployment. We are talking 
about [four-second break in reception] productive investment, 
especially for small and midsize producers, which are the two 
sectors that create the most jobs. We must also encourage 
foreign investment. For the past year I have been working on 
this with a group of U.S. investors who want to invest in our 
country. We are going to implement these types of actions. We 
are also going to ensure that state funds deposited in private 
banks will be used to promote development and job creation. That 
is the fourth measure I would implement. 
  The fifth measure is to confront this government's 
shortcomings in terms of the peace plans. We will solve the 
land problem that has not been solved. We will compensate 
former soldiers and national policemen with programs for their 
reintegration into the country's economic life. We are going to 
handle the problems faced by the war disabled from both sides. 
We will allocate the necessary funds to develop the institution 
that has been created for them. 
  Those are the first and most important measures we will 
adopt. In sum, I will prove during my first few months in office 
that we are going to make changes, but changes that reflect an 
intelligent combination of modifications and continuity. 
  [Funes] Dr. Zamora, you still have a minute. You have 
presented a concise plan for the first 100 days, but I would 
like to ask you another question. There is a real problem, the 
root of which is governing. The economic measures to be 
implemented in those first days also calls for a process of 
agreement among the various sectors, particularly the economic 
sectors. How will you accomplish this? You represent a 
coalition of leftist parties. One of the biggest doubts the 
various sectors have is whether the left is capable of achieving 
a modicum of understanding among the different groups in light 
of the country's current situation and whether the left is 
capable of governing. 
  [Zamora] If there was ever anyone in this country who worked 
toward an understanding [26-second break in reception]. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Funes] Thank you very much. According to the drawing, 
Edgardo Rodriguez Eigenhart, National Solidarity Movement [MSN] 
candidate, is next. 
  [Rodriguez] The MSN proposes several measures. The first is 
related to the structural adjustment program. We would request 
a meeting with the IMF and the Inter-American Development Bank 
[IDB] to adopt measures related to the problems caused by our 
country's structural adjustment. We are worried, because we 
know there are private meetings going on now between the World 
Bank, IDB, IMF, and the government to discuss a possible 
devaluation that would be implemented after the elections. 
  Second, we would seek international cooperation, especially 
for land transfer projects. We would seek international 
cooperation at a donors meeting to expedite the obtainment of 
financial resources of approximately $275 million, which are 
required to comply with this part of the peace agreements. 
  Third, we would seek a consolidation of budgets; that is, 
the 
merger of regular and special budgets under the sole control of 
the Finance Ministry instead of maintaining separate budgets, as 
is currently being done, because this could lead to corruption, 
inefficiency, or a mishandling of the nation's money. 
  Fourth are tax collection and fiscal evasion. We have 
noticed the Chamber of Commerce's statements regarding 
contraband. We would try to improve the fiscal collection 
mechanisms and enforce the law against fiscal evasion. This is 
pursuant to the call by the Salvadoran Chamber of Commerce and 
Industries to apply severe corrective measures to prevent 
contraband and apply the full force of the law against any 
official involved in contraband in our country. We all know 
there is much contraband that is not being combated at custom 
posts and border areas, because the government is not firmly 
committed to doing so. 
  Fifth, we would review interest rates; that is, review the 
financial system's interest rates to ensure they match the 
inflation rates which supposedly exist in our country and which 
are between 9 and 12 percent. The gap between active and 
passive rates is too wide, and we think they must have a 
coherent relationship with the national inflation rate. 
  In international trade, we will adopt a mechanism to promote 
the union of private enterprise and unions to take advantage of 
the SGP [Generalized System of Preferences] and the Caribbean 
Basin Initiative regarding investments and technology in order 
to prepare our country for achieving a future competitiveness 
within the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA. This 
means we must strengthen El Salvador's international negotiation 
team with international law experts who can solve international 
legal problems concerning NAFTA's adoption and implementation. 
One of our priorities will obviously be to expedite the 
economic integration process at the regional level, particularly 
with the Central American economic market. 
  Another important measure for us is that the investment of 
family remittances should become a productive investment; in 
other words, we will design a financial system program that 
encourages the beneficiaries of family remittances to invest in 
the production sector, in mini and small enterprises, to help 
generate riches and distribute the economic surplus. We will 
establish consortiums between mini and small businessmen and big 
businessmen so these two sectors can integrate, through an 
exposure to business dynamism, to improve production and exports. 
  [Funes] Excuse me, Doctor. Only 30 seconds more, please. 
  [Rodriguez] We will strive to make a long-term strategic 
investment with the IDB and the World Bank for the recovery of 
the country's hydrographic basins, the reconversion of its 
industrial sector, the protection of its ecology, and the 
maintenance of its aquiferous strata. I conclude here, although 
three or four measures are still pending. I think we can 
discuss them later in the debate. 
  [Funes] Dr. Roberto Escobar Garcia, presidential candidate 
of the PCN [National Conciliation Party]. You have five minutes 
to outline what would be the first measures you would take. We 
are also defining a specific time for the adoption of decisions 
and for the implementation of these measures--we mean emergency 
measures--during the first 100 days in government. If you are 
elected, what would you do in the economic sector? 
  [Escobar Garcia] Thank you for the invitation, Mauricio. I 
believe the importance of this program derives from the ideas 
and specific measures we may provide to counter urgent problems, 
leaving middle- and long-term problems for a later date. 
  In this regard, we cannot concentrate on social and age 
composition, employment, consumer population, but we must look 
to the working public, because we all know work is a very 
serious problem. We are dealing here with a very important and 
delicate issue; that is why I met with my economic team led by 
my partner on the ticket, Mr. Marquesin, and we have discussed 
certain measures divided into three large groups. 
  The first measure refers to the recovery of the agriculture 
sector; the second refers to industrial recovery, the third to 
massive public works. Regarding the recovery of the agriculture 
sector, we believe we can start working fast on the fiber issue, 
such as cotton, [word indistinct], and sisal. We can also begin 
working on intensive cattle raising, particularly in the 
northeastern part of the country, and nontraditional products, 
particularly those being sold to the United States, such as 
watermelon and melon. We can also perhaps work on marine 
products. 
  Regarding industrial recovery, we will undoubtedly devote 
our 
attention to assembly plants, because they require smaller 
investments; in addition, the training of assembly plant workers 
is not really difficult. Furthermore, we will work to export 
those products we are more capable of exporting, such as 
pharmaceuticals and chemicals, which, at this time, rank third 
among Salvadoran exports. Furthermore, in this area we will 
give special attention to the metalworking industry, which is 
even producing spare parts for national consumption. 
  Regarding the area of massive public works, we must pay 
immediate attention to roads, airport expansions, pier 
expansions, and large-scale constructions of schools. We 
believe these measures can be perfectly implemented in the first 
100 days of government. Even though their effects may not be 
perceived immediately, the measures taken in a timely fashion 
upon assuming the government and even before would make it 
possible to resolve the immediate problem I stated at the 
beginning. [sentence as heard] The medium- and long- term 
measures will come later. 
  [Funes] Thank you, Doctor. To conclude this first round, 
Christian Democratic Party candidate Dr. Fidel Chavez Mena will 
now speak. 
  [Chavez Mena] Thanks, Mauricio. Congratulations on taking 
this initiative. We deplore the absence of Armando Calderon Sol, 
ARENA's [Nationalist Republican Alliance] official candidate. We 
think he is wrong to refuse to participate in the debate with 
the other candidates so the people can have a better idea of our 
respective views. 
  We believe there are three important aspects: Crime, lack of 
jobs, and price policy. I will split this five minutes into 
three blocks. First, measures to ensure governability. This is 
essential. We are convinced we are the only ones who can give 
this country a framework of governability, that we are the only 
ones capable of leading and carrying out a political and 
economic project according to the reality and the correlation of 
existing forces. 
  As soon as it is known we were the elected candidates for 
president and vice president, we intended to create a climate of 
confidence, which is essential for the business sector. Our 
model of social and market economy rests on entrepreneurs, who 
are the dynamic motor of economic activities. They must have the 
psychological element of confidence and security. Therefore, our 
first action will be to meet with the most representative 
entrepreneurial sectors to set the rules of the economic game 
and to say very clearly that our government will befriend 
entrepreneurs, and is willing to create, expand, and stimulate 
business. Then, within this concept of participation, we will 
immediately stimulate the creation of a national congress with 
delegates from the business and labor sectors as well as experts 
to discuss the economic strategy to be implemented during our 
government. 
  Third, we will reactivate the economic reorganization forum 
-- this is essential in fulfilling the peace agreements -- to 
present a national emergency plan for attaining a social truce 
in six months, during which time we will present our initiative 
to freeze the price of staples, establish a salary policy 
consistent with stability and the prevailing fiscal situation, 
and determine the measures to be immediately taken to combat 
poverty and the problems derived from structure adjustments. In 
addition, we intend to create a National Agricultural and 
Livestock Council to stimulate agriculture with the direct 
participation of the country's various agricultural sectors so 
they can define, stimulate, and supervise those policies. 
  Given the importance of Central American integration, it is 
necessary to create a commission to start negotiating Central 
American integration. Also, it is necessary to create a National 
Women's Association to incorporate women more effectively into 
productive activities. Mini-, small-, and medium-size 
enterprises, as well as agricultural sectors, will immediately 
be incorporated into the state institutions directly linked to 
their respective sectors. A very important criterion will be the 
gradual application of economic policies and the search for a 
consensus before establishing these economic policies. 
  Finally, we think it is very important to reach a basic 
political agreement among the country's political forces as a 
part of governability so this governability can allow for the 
stability and the security that the state needs. 
  The second block would consists of measures to begin 
resolving the most pressing economic problems. The first block 
deals with governability of the economy. Now for the second 
block. First, the immediate reactivation of the country's 
hospitals network. Essentially, this is a social subject, but, 
given its relationship to economic problems and the country's 
human problem, the existing hospitals and health centers network 
must be reactivated. 
  Second, we intend to create approximately 120,000 jobs in 
six 
months through productive basic infrastructure projects to be 
financed with the $465 million currently available, of which 
only 25 percent has been disbursed. We have appointed a group of 
experts so these projects, which are essentially productive and 
focused on the areas in conflict and where the most serious 
poverty exists, can be initiated immediately. We will be 
prepared to disburse at least $200 million. The government has 
been inept in handling these disbursements. 
  On the other hand, we plan to draft the 1995 budget, we 
plan to present a foreign cooperation policy on the subjects of 
ecology, drugs, migration, the problem of disbursements for 
production activities and the case of (?residents) in El 
Salvador. We propose to eliminate the value added tax on staple 
products, elements necessary for production, and raw material 
necessary for the pharmaceutical and other similar industries. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Escobar Garcia] We insist on the agricultural sector's 
recovery because, based on the government's experience in this 
area, we know it can be reactivated quickly. For example, when 
we talk about fiber and cotton, we are talking about a product 
produced the same year; in other words, foreign exchanges 
obtained with cotton exports are received immediately. 
Naturally, there will be some questions about the relation 
between cotton and the environment, but that depends on 
production techniques and the number of manzanas used in El 
Salvador for this activity. 
  Therefore, when we talk about the recovery of the 
agricultural and livestock sector, we are talking about the 
country's northeastern region, which has been quite affected. 
During our visits to that area, Ocicala, Sesori, and other areas 
affected by the conflict, we have seen interest and it is 
possible to quickly develop the cattle industry almost 
immediately. Right now, when we tour those areas and review 
agricultural activities, we realize the great efforts that are 
being made. Therefore, it is just a matter of giving the sector 
the encouragement and incentives it needs. We are also working 
on some nontraditional products. Although some Fusades 
[Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development] 
programs have not been successful, we have gained some 
experience in exporting nontraditional products. 
  As you can see, all these measures focus on sectors that are 
currently facing more difficulties, but which are capable of 
recovering in a short period of time, as I just said. This 
group, of course, includes the reformed sector. The 
configuration of landownership has changed, and consequently we 
must pay more attention to cooperatives and [word indistinct]. 
The cooperatives problem, which are now facing a very difficult 
financial situation, could be resolved or eased through special 
plans. 
  As for the political aspect of your question -- criticism 
about the concentration of wealth -- I would like to say that if 
we analyze policies that existed 20 or 30 years ago, those 
policies could seem inadequate today even though they were 
correct at that time. Therefore, we can say with absolute 
certainty that during its government, the PCN achieved 
significant economic growth, social development, and to some 
degree paved the road for the political development we now have. 
These criticisms are groundless and seem to respond more to 
political interests than to real situations that clearly and 
specifically belong to the past. [passage omitted] 
  [Funes] We have a question for Rodriguez. You mentioned tax 
evasion and you proposed treating it as a crime. Specifically, 
how could this practice be eliminated; what specific measures 
would you implement during the first 100 days of your government 
to eradicate the problem of tax evasion in order to collect more 
revenues for the state? Would you be willing to use 10 percent 
of the taxes for the renovation of jails and in that way reduce 
crime? 
  [Rodriguez] We believe guaranteeing compliance with our laws 
is a matter of political willingness. We believe it is possible 
to obtain additional income for the state through more 
efficient, productive, technical controls of the Salvadoran 
general tax system. For example, we believe there is a shortage 
of personnel and real capacity to handle the value added tax, 
VAT. 
  We have also said we share the idea that the VAT should be 
eliminated from foods, staples, electricity, and potable water. 
We believe an adequate VAT on luxury items could substantially 
increase fiscal revenues, thereby reducing the impact on 
products that are basic for the majority of Salvadorans. We 
believe it is possible to improve tax collection through state 
reforms, better training, human development, and technology. 
There are many ways to improve it. We believe this is something 
we must do immediately after assuming the government. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Funes] Colonel, you were demobilized and know the armed 
institution very well. I am surprised that your first 100-day 
program does not mention measures guaranteeing the productive 
reinsertion of demobilized military personnel, taking into 
account the current situation. I suppose the television viewer 
has referred to the fundamental issue, which has been raised 
recently, on compensation payments to demobilized Armed Forces 
members and guaranteeing their productive reinsertion. 
Specifically: What do you offer demobilized Armed Forces' 
personnel and how can you guarantee the productive reinsertion 
of these men, who only fought during the war, therefore they 
have no production capacity? 
  [Escobar] Thank you Mauricio, and I also thank the person 
who 
posed this question because it gives me the opportunity to refer 
to a sector that is linked to my own feelings without taking 
into account the patriotic role they played during the recently 
concluded conflict. This is certainly one of the most difficult 
issues to deal with, as is being observed in the very 
application of the reinsertion of both sides' former combatants. 
This is a decision that does not solely depend on the 
government; it also depends on the will of the people who would 
benefit from these measures. In this regard, the programs the 
government established are currently being implemented. I do not 
know if they are being implemented speedily or broadly enough 
but they have already been set up. Once I take office, however, 
the reinsertion program's basic points would have to be totally 
reviewed. Numberless criticisms and many commentaries have been 
made on this subject, therefore the basic points would have to 
be reviewed to determine the people who are going to be 
reinserted and in what areas. 
  I had not thought of this issue as an emergency measure. As 
I 
said at the beginning of my participation, I tried to narrow my 
comments down to what you had specifically requested, immediate 
measures, that is shock [preceding word in English] measures. In 
reality, the demobilized program should continue within the 
government, but is not necessarily a shock program that will 
reactivate the economy and partially resolve the unemployment 
problem. I definitely did not take or we did not take this issue 
into account as part of the immediate measures to be 
implemented. This program must be continued; it must be reviewed 
and assessed if the basic reinsertion budget and conditions 
respond to the reality of this specific issue. I would like to 
make it very clear that we have not excluded the demobilized 
from our priorities, rather it is because these programs, in our 
opinion, do not correspond to the government's first 100 days. 
  [Funes] Thank you very. Now Mr. Chavez Mena, here are 
several 
questions, however, I will ask you to be brief as we are short 
on time. Here is a question. I imagine it is from a businessman. 
As one of the emergency measures to be implemented in the first 
100 days of your government, you have proposed price controls on 
basic products. Doesn't price control recall the ghost of state 
intervention that plunged the Christian Democratic government 
during Napoleon Duarte's administration to discredit and defeat? 
How do you intend to implement this price control, and won't 
this price control discourage investment? 
  [Chavez] We have not talked about price control. We have 
talked about price freezing though...[pauses] only of the family 
basket food products. This is to be combined with a salary 
policy with economic measures to combat poverty, of course. 
Where would this measure be discussed? This would be discussed 
precisely at a forum, as I stated previously. 
  I am glad this question came up as it gives me the 
opportunity to explain matters. It is precisely through market 
mechanisms and a six-month period, which we call a social truce, 
that we will implement this price freezing process. This goes 
hand in hand with removing the VAT from family basket food 
products. This measure is precisely to reduce the increase 
generated by the VAT to family basket food products' costs and 
prices. Therefore, we believe it is very important to implement 
this price freeze, as the result of a consensus, as was done 
with great success in Mexico, Bolivia, Argentina, and recently 
in Chile with regard to taxes. This can be achieved by making a 
difference; that is freezing prices, establishing a salary 
policy, establishing certain measures by consensus as a result 
of a social accord, a social agreement. This is what I am 
referring to. 
  This is a matter of justice; this is a matter that responds 
to an economic need and truly responds to the people's feelings. 
The people in this country cannot support the cost of living. A 
time gap, a social truce must be implement. This is the reason 
for the price freeze. 
  I would also like to take this opportunity to make a brief 
comment on the ability to govern issue addressed to me. We 
insist that a leftist government, from former guerrillas in this 
country, would not make the nation governable nor stable. 
  It would have problems owing to the mistrust the business 
sector may feel; something that would generate even greater 
difficulties and contribute to a level of regional instability. 
In this respect, we feel the country is not prepared from a 
historic and political standpoint to have a government headed by 
the FMLN-CD. As for the business PARE [expansion unknown] Dr. 
Zamora referred to, it was essentially a political PARE. The PDC 
defended the country's economic system; it defended the economic 
system. It began a process of democratization. In addition, it 
began a process of international cooperation. 
  I want to state it in this manner because the ability to 
govern topic is essential, and we must say clearly it. There is 
a lot of mistrust. We are proposing trust, that is, generating a 
climate of trust within the business sector. We have talked to 
them. My relations with business sectors are very good. We have 
clearly outlined our criteria for gradual steps and consensus, 
or rather the search for consensus prior to adopting major 
economic policies instead of adopting them without 
consultations. In this respect, I want to refer to Mr. 
Rodriguez' remark, who seems to have been truly swayed by the 
ads. We had a debate prior to all those economic measures. There 
really was political motivation behind the ads of a group of 
politicized businessmen who entrenched themselves and joined the 
ARENA ranks. In addition, we had a war, and the economy was 
constantly being sabotaged. The economic and electricity 
infrastructure was damaged, and this really caused an economic 
problem that was extremely delicate. We have to put ourselves in 
that historic situation. In conclusion and in thinking of the 
future, what we have to have is, that in order to be able to 
govern, to be able to implement a political program, we need to 
have a political program. For one reason or another, the Pope 
correctly said that neoliberalism has been a failure wherever it 
has been implemented. In Brazil with Collor de Mello, in 
Honduras, in Costa Rica, where there were problems because of 
neoliberalism, in Venezuela,.... 
  [Funes interrupting] Allow me to interrupt you, but we have 
a 
time limitation, and every candidate has four minutes. 
  [Chavez] I just want to conclude by saying real socialism 
has 
disappeared. The ability to govern problem is essential, and I 
wanted to refer to it. [passage omitted]

  [Text] On Sunday [13 March], the Nationalist Republican 
Alliance [Arena] charged that militants of the former guerrilla 
organization attacked a Saturday march by the ruling party in 
San Salvador. Two people were injured, one of them by a bullet. 
An Arena communique disclosed that one citizen was beaten, 
while a young woman was shot. Both were taken to a San Salvador 
hospital. 
  On Saturday, thousands of Arena supporters marched along the 
streets of San Salvador to close the campaign. According to the 
communique, some of the marchers were attacked by hooded men who 
burned tires; threw bottles, stones, and water balloons at the 
marchers; and later physically attacked Arena supporters. 
  On Saturday night, Arena publicly urged Ruben Zamora, 
leftist 
presidential candidate, and Jorge Shafik Handal, coordinator of 
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, to control their 
supporters. 
  Meanwhile on Sunday, the Office of the Ombudsman for Human 
Rights condemned the violent events, and, without blaming any 
political party, said the human rights of those who were 
demonstrating peacefully had been violated.

  [Text] The National Defense Ministry yesterday graduated 28 
professionals who represent the nation's different sectors at 
the close of the first running of Strategic High-Level Studies. 
This is a demonstration of the armed institution's efforts to 
improve civilian-military relations. 
  General Ernesto Corado Figueroa, former defense minister, 
said at the close of the event: "For the first time in El 
Salvador's history an education course with civilians has been 
established to analyze aspects of security, defense, and 
development that will have an important impact within society." 
Corado added: "This demonstrates that the Armed Forces can 
work together with the people for the nation's well-being, 
despite the ideological and partisan differences." 
  The general explained that this course is part of the 
education efforts and restructuring that are taking place in the 
armed institution in times of peace. For Corado, 
civilian-military relations were significantly marred during the 
12-year armed conflict. After the signing of the peace 
agreement, however, the need to improve relations was 
acknowledged. 
  In this regard, the changes made by the armed institution 
have allowed the promotion of participation -- under equal 
opportunities -- of civilian and military personnel in projects 
of national interest linked to the nation's development and have 
lead to strengthening harmonious coexistence, the general noted. 
  Alfredo Cristiani, president of the Republic and Armed 
Forces 
general commander, was present at the graduation ceremony. 
Cristiani highlighted the Defense Ministry's effort by providing 
a course that sets an example for the overall handling of 
national leadership. "The new reality prevailing in the nation 
demands top level preparation in all fields; the Armed Forces 
are contributing to the consolidation of peace," Cristiani said. 
  Likewise, the School of Strategic High-Level Studies 
yesterday inaugurated the second running which will include 36 
students who represent the government, the Armed Forces, the 
private sector, universities, political parties, and the FMLN 
[Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]. 
  Ferman Cienfuegos, FMLN member said: This course has a 
historical transcendency because for the first time after the 
war, civilian and soldier are united; this will contribute to 
constructing a national consensus. Cienfuegos indicated that 
the armed institution is changing because it no longer is 
manipulated by the political parties. This is a very important 
precedent because the Armed Forces are state institutions 
currently at the service of the people. 
  The first running of Strategic High-Level Studies initiated 
in September 1993 falls within the framework of the new Armed 
Forces Education System, according to the constitutional reform 
passed in April 1992.

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" Program with host Carlos Santana Ojeda and </F>
guest Osvaldo Rodriguez from weekly JUVENTUD REBELDE -- live] 
  [Text] [Santana] Osvaldo, are there indications of an 
economic recovery, and if so, in which sectors are these 
indications emerging at this moment? 
  [Rodriguez] Well, first I want to tell you, Carlos, that 
"Straight Talk" has already made some predictions for this year, 
1994, for the beginning of the year, to be exact. On making 
those predictions, we said that this year, 1994, was the year 
when some symptoms of economic recovery would be emerging. They 
would be modest symptoms, as you said, but recovery after all. 
  At this moment we cannot yet talk about economic 
reactivation. I think we can only talk about symptoms of 
economic reactivation, because so far some areas which have been 
declining, [words indistinct] of the Steelworking Industry 
[SIME] which in 1993 announced that it managed to stop its 
decline, and even managed to pick up somewhat. But this shows 
that compared to 1992 there is a recovery. 
  Let us consider tourism. Tourism is today the most stable 
sector of our economy. It is a sector that has been growing on a 
yearly basis with net and gross income. I also think that 
tourism is having a domino effect on the rest of the economy. 
Why? Well, because the tourism industry demands a number of 
resources that the country itself can supply. Today these 
resources are sought abroad. This forces the Cuban economy to 
divert its merchandise toward tourism. 
  I was also talking about the steelworking industry. This 
industry has strong investments dedicated exclusively to 
tourism. But not only the steelworking industry. Agriculture 
must also seek strong investments and sufficient production in 
order to meet all the needs of tourism, and in addition to this, 
there must be other services such as laundering, dry cleaning, 
water supply systems, electricity lines, etc. All these things 
ensure that the gross tourism income is redistributed among the 
rest of the economy. 
  [Santana] Does this mean that you see tourism as the sector 
that is showing signs of reactivation? 
  [Rodriguez] Well, tourism in itself is a sector where.... 
  [Santana, interrupting] I am asking this question, Osvaldo, 
because I would not mention tourism as a sector of reactivation, 
but as a fully consolidated branch. 
  [Rodriguez] Well, both things. It is a branch that is 
consolidating itself. But in relation to the national economy, 
growing tourism is a sign of economic reactivation because it is 
only a sector, which together with petroleum, has been expanding 
all these past years, including these recent crisis years. I am 
happy to remember the case of petroleum because I have almost 
forgotten the efforts made by the petroleum workers. The fact 
that our country extracted 100,000 tons of petroleum last year 
is another symptom of the economy's reactivation. But this year, 
the work being carried out with some foreign companies, namely 
through the so-called risk contracts, must also begin yielding 
results. Nothing has been announced so far, but they have been 
working for a little more than a year looking for petroleum. 
  [Santana] Suppose we have to make an anlysis of those 
sectors 
-- which do you think is most responsible for that economic 
reactivation, or at least, which do you think is the most 
important? 
  [Rodriguez] Well, unquestionably, the sugar industry is the 
most important of all. But the most representative of economic 
reactivation, as I said before, is tourism. I have explained the 
reasons for this, and I am now going to explain why the sugar 
industry is the most important. 
  The sugar industry is what has always maintained the Cuban 
economy, what has yielded the most important fruits, both for 
the current foreign trade structure and for the previous 
structure, when the socialist bloc was still in effect, when our 
most important sales to the world market, including to the CEMA 
market, had been by the sugar industry. The sugar industry, seen 
in its broadest sense, produces not only sugar, but also 
alcohol, molasses, other byproducts such as bagasse; now the 
medicines, the cattle feed, and many other products resulting 
from the sugar industry. 
  But today, we are facing an energy crisis. In addition to 
the 
great crisis, energy or the lack of petroleum, is what has led 
us to this profound crisis. Cane has therefore also become our 
petroleum. I think, therefore, that we must be careful when 
dealing with the sugar industry, because the future of Cuba must 
be the sugar industry future. Cuba cannot dream of a future that 
is not the sugar industry. Even though we might find a large 
petroleum deposit, sugar will always be the source of all the 
things I have mentioned. 
  [Santana] Yes, sugarcane is considered the economic 
activity that can help us most under the current circumstances. 
However, is this hope justified? 
  [Rodriguez] Of course. There is the sugarcane recovery 
program. We have to keep in mind that our fields have been 
highly exploited, which makes the soil lose its fertility. It is 
therefore necessary to fertilize the land used for sugarcane. 
The lack of fertilizer, first, and the lack of herbicides, 
second, have resulted in a significant drop in sugarcane 
production. This hope is justified because we are very seriously 
working in the recovery program. Today, the main goal of the 
Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC's] is to restore 
sugarcane production to former levels. 
  Whenever sugarcane production is restored, the harvest will 
of course regain its rate, which had been stabilized at the 
8-ton mark. We have to return to that level of harvest. 
  [Santana] You also spoke of the steelworking industry. I am 
still not clear. You spoke about this industry in light of the 
importance of production of equipment for other industries? 
  [Rodriguez] For other industries.... [pauses] The 
steelworking industry is capable of building mills, and also 
many other types of equipment. It is capable of manufacturing 
pumps. Significant investments are being made. This industry 
puts out a considerable amount of electricity and telephone 
cables. It is also a great provider of spare parts. It is a 
tremendous producer of steels, not only carbon steels, but also 
stainless steel, which is now produced in Cuba. I believe that 
the potential of this industry, which has taken years to shape 
-- this is not something done overnight -- is marked by the 
specialization of its workers, technicians, and engineers. This 
allows us to use this industry to develop the country and also 
as a source of exports. 
  [Santana] Once again on tourism: I understand that Cuban 
tourism has performed favorably in terms of international 
marketing in recent months. Is this true? What do you know about 
it? 
  [Rodriguez] Yes, I have read about this issue. I believe it 
is very interesting that Cuba is already being seen extensively 
by tourists in the Caribbean Basin. It is predicted that by the 
end of the century, the Caribbean will be the world's top spot 
for tourism. Cuba is not competing with many Caribbean islands 
today. There are very small Caribbean islands -- perhaps 
slightly larger than the Isle of Youth -- that welcome 1 million 
tourists. We are beginning to develop. We began tourism late. We 
must remember that it is difficult to reduce that distance. Of 
course, we must keep the U.S. blockade in mind. The greatest 
number of cruise ships in the Caribbean and around Cuba, 
transporting approximately 8 million tourists, are based in 
Miami. These are American businesses. The blockade bans all 
those ships, although they skirt every Cuban coast without 
touching Cuban ports. This, undoubtedly, affects us seriously. I 
believe that despite this, tourism is arriving. We have many 
European, particularly German and Canadian, [as heard] tourists. 
Latin American tourism is also beginning to increase. I believe 
that this will fulfill those predictions that Cuba will welcome 
1 million tourists. 
  [Santana] In what measure is this reactivation the result of 
the opening to certain foreign capital investments on one hand, 
and on the other, the result of the increase in our productivity 
and quality, in the economic effort based on efficiency and 
controls? 
  [Rodriguez] I believe it is a combination of all these 
things. The foreign capital investment has allowed us, first of 
all, to access markets, access technologies and capital. This is 
the case with tourism. We said that tourism is one of the model 
industries of this reactivation. Foreign capital not only forms 
part of the tourism industry, it also plays a role in 
reactivating other important industries within Cuba. I believe 
this has played a role. Undoubtedly, the increased awareness of 
Cuban workers -- better yet, the collectives -- of the need to 
perform more efficiently, work better, and even come to believe 
that the products must be consumed immediately and not be 
produced to be stored away, and with poor quality, becoming 
aware of all these things has resulted in higher efficiency, 
which today cannot yet be seen in any plans because the Cuban 
economy has just completed the process of decline. 
  [Santana] How can we guarantee the soundness of that 
reactivation being experienced? 
  [Rodriguez] First of all, we have to consolidate the Cuban 
economy on the basis of our national structures -- to defend 
what is ours, to advocate the best possible use of our 
resources, and learn to work with high levels of efficiency, 
economizing, and using true economic controls. There is no need 
to think that a foreigner is needed to teach this to us. I 
believe we have foreigners here teaching us very interesting 
things, but we can also make our own contributions because when 
you speak with workers, they know quite well what needs to be 
done. 
  [Santana] We have discussed macroeconomic issues. When will 
the reactivation be felt at home? 
  [Rodriguez] First of all, in terms of nutrition, I believe 
this is the first thing that the people are expecting. We speak 
of symptoms, and even some comrades have smiled and said: 
Symptoms! With the needs we have today! 
  I have had to explain that the economic reactivation has to 
take place before the domestic part of the economy will feel the 
reactivation. The first problem at home is food. I believe we 
have to solve this first. In what measure can this be solved? 
Well, this is perhaps a subject for another program. 
  Secondly, we need to satisfy a variety of primary needs 
because this crisis has resulted in the lack of many things. We 
could make an endless list of household items we need to 
provide. These are perhaps not vital for tackling tomorrow, but 
are vital to the life of any civilized individual today.

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" Program with host Juan Carlos Roque Garcia </F>
and guest Osvaldo Rodriguez from JUVENTUD REBELDE -- live] 
  [Text] [Roque] Osvaldo Rodriguez from JUVENTUD REBELDE is 
with us again today because last week we left our subject 
unfinished. We were discussing the underground economy, or the 
submerged economy, as it is also called. I think there are many 
people with doubts, and surely this program seeks to clear up 
some of those doubts and explain some of these trends. I was 
talking with an economics student about this program. She did 
have the opportunity to listen. She said she was rather 
surprised over your definition of this matter as an underground 
economy, or black market, which are not the same. One is 
implicit in the other, but they are not the same. I also think 
this was the reason for an analysis of other subjects related to 
this issue. 
  [Rodriguez] I can give you an additional definition: It is 
also called an informal economy in other countries, namely in 
Latin America. This submerged economy can be defined as an 
aspect of the economics that are affecting Cuba at this moment. 
  [Roque] Yes, and in the previous program we said that this 
is 
not a problem in Cuba alone, but is a problem affecting all 
societies. Also that it comes from a capitalist society. 
  [Rodriguez] Of course. 
  [Roque] This problem is a derivative of capitalist society, 
and today this activity is at its peak in Latin American 
economies. To define it, I was saying that transactions of goods 
and services that are not officially authorized can be either 
legal or illegal. Here is where some confusion can emerge 
concerning the black market versus the underground economy. The 
black market can be part of the underground economy, but it is 
not the only thing within the underground economy. 
  Recently, in a program when my friend Renato Recio was 
present, we were discussing the cigarette issue. We were saying 
that a large number of people are assigned certain allocations 
of cigarettes. One of the proposals submitted today in the 
parliament is that in work places we should to try eliminate 
these allocations. Well, according to a recent study conducted 
by a group of friends from the Research Institute to which I had 
access, they reached the conclusion that only 40 percent of the 
people who receive normal and controlled allocations of 
cigarettes are in fact smokers. The rest -- well, some of these 
allocations go to the family, but others use them to sell in the 
underground economy. This is the example I was giving the other 
day, because if I, a nonsmoker, receive cigarettes that are 
assigned to my house and I submit them to the informal economy, 
either by selling or bartering them, it is neither an illegal, 
nor a black-market activity. It is informal economics, 
nonofficial economics. Of course, this situation does not affect 
the economy as much as the black market because the black market 
is within the underground economy. Well, to make it clearer, let 
me tell you this: If I exchange one of my cigarette packs for a 
bag of rice, it is not black market. 
  [Rodriguez] No, it is not black market, it is underground 
economy; and if you sell that box of cigarettes, as usually 
happens, at black-market price, it is not black market. It is 
underground economy, but it does have an effect. The same thing 
happens with those people who do not drink, but who sell their 
rum at black-market prices. 
  [Roque] We are talking about the underground economy. 
Osvaldo, why has this term emerged, and why has this phenomenon 
occurred in the world economy? 
  [Rodriguez] First, let us begin with why it emerged in 
Cuba. It was the shortage in state supplies to the population 
that enlarged and consolidated this type of economy, which we 
can call underground or informal economy. Undoubtedly, it is 
nourished by excess currency that is not backed by goods. That 
is its origin. I wish to point out that this existed or 
coexisted before, with financial stability, when there were 
undoubtedly deficiencies in the official market of products that 
were in great demand. We could talk about shoes, for example. 
  [Roque] Yes, I believe that having discussed here the 
concepts of black-market and underground economies, we can see 
that it is not a phenomenon that has only now emerged, but as 
you said, it existed in parallel with the stability of certain 
years. I can remember that in the eighties -- I call this period 
the golden decade because we were very stable, especially with 
food products -- there were some products that were also sold on 
the street in that way. It was not a black market, but you 
needed to go to this underground economy to satisfy the need for 
products that you could not find on the official market. 
  [Rodriguez] Yes, this study I was talking about makes an 
interesting point: During the period of financial stability, the 
population's expenses in the underground economy did not exceed 
20 percent. 
  I would also like to answer the other part of your question 
on how it emerged. I am sure that in your trips to Mexico you 
have seen the illicit street vendors. This underground economy 
is more prominent in Latin America and underdeveloped countries. 
It is the economy of immigrants in developed countries. 
  [Roque] These people do not pay taxes. That is probably one 
of the main things that make it an underground economy: It is 
not controlled by the state. 
  [Rodriguez] Right, they are not officially authorized. 
  [Roque] There it has its beginnings. Here in Cuba it has a 
different beginning. 
  [Rodriguez] Here it has other causes. Necessity is what 
drives this economy. The main difference between the presence of 
an underground economy in that market economy and in our economy 
is that over there they compete below official prices. 
  [Roque] And the necessities are different. 
  [Rodriguez] Yes, of course. Here it is the speculators who 
use the black market to try to get rich or to try to live better 
than the average citizen. 
  [Roque] Something that stands out is that over there, it is 
the complete opposite. There they lower the prices. In other 
words, their prices are lower than those of the state. 
  [Rodriguez] Inside that economy, there is also a black 
market 
because many of the products that are sold at lower prices are 
stolen, or are products that are smuggled into the country. They 
therefore are not charged customs or taxes, and have a shady 
origin. 
  [Roque] Let us talk about our problem. How can we resolve 
this situation -- do away with the underground economy? We know 
that the main factor is production. We must stabilize production 
levels in general. Without goods to back the excess currency 
circulating on the streets... [pauses] everything is connected 
here. Everything is related to the other. People must accept 
this information and these explanations in order to understand 
the concepts of the economy. 
  [Rodriguez] I think you are right. We must first increase 
our 
production, as you said before, but we must also remember that 
the official market will take some time to change. There is a 
group of needs, especially services. The underground economy 
involves not only the sale of goods, it also includes the sale 
of services. That too forms part of the underground economy. It 
is going to take some time to be able to solve that. 
  [Roque] And in this case of services, can the tax system 
help, or contribute toward putting an end to this phenomenon? 
  [Rodriguez] Well, if it is organized, it can. We cannot say 
that self-employed workers are part of the underground economy 
because they are authorized and licensed by the state. They pay 
taxes to the state and are authorized to produce and market 
their product in determined places. They are not the problem. 
The problem is those who do this illegally. It is those persons 
who provide services or who sell their products illegally. We 
cannot always call things illegal, because there are times when 
there is no law, as in the example we mentioned of selling 
something from our house. There is no law that prohibits me from 
selling something from my house and there is no law that imposes 
a tax on that sale. There are countries where that does exist. 
Any transaction between two people requires a tax to the state 
because it is a business transaction. 
  [Roque] We are talking about the underground economy. I must 
admit that this is a topic I do not know much about since I am 
not an economist; but at the same time, I am very interested, as 
are many of the listeners. 
  [Rodriguez] I am not an economist either, but I have read 
some material that I have received and I believe it is an 
interesting subject because it is a passionate subject. It is 
something we are currently living. 
  [Roque] Let us look at this study that was conducted. I can 
see that we are concerned about this problem. We are at least 
studying the phenomenon and looking for ways or alternatives for 
its solution. 
  [Rodriguez] Yes, this study has a series of proposals that 
we 
could leave for another program, because they are interesting 
proposals. 
  [Roque] We are going to have to call them Underground 
Economy 
One, Underground Economy Two, and present a series of 
programs.... 
  [Rodriguez, interrupting] ... and proposals for solutions to 
the underground economy. These researchers point out something 
very interesting: They say that everytime there is a structural 
imbalance between supply and demand, there will be economic 
space for the underground economy, which is created through the 
redistribution of income. Of course, we are talking about the 
Cuban phenomenon. We are not talking about the underground 
economy of other places where the prices are below those of the 
official market. We are talking about our situation. We must 
remember that people go to the underground economy to improve 
the structure of consumption, due to deficiencies in the 
assortment and existence of products from the state supply. 
People also go to the underground economy in cases when they 
have excess income, to try to increase satisfaction of their 
needs. These are the reasons why people go to this underground 
economy. Just recently, this was discussed on a Straight Talk 
program. 
  For the most objective analysis of our current situation, 
the 
financial imbalance, we must look at the merchandise, not the 
money. Money keeps accruing because there is a lack of goods. As 
soon as these goods begin to appear, and these measures that we 
are all waiting for are applied to balance our domestic economy, 
the problems of this underground economy will also be solved. As 
these products we are all hoping to produce begin appearing, we 
start to hope that one day we will have the money to buy them. 
As the excess currency begins disappearing, the black-market 
prices will not be as high as those that the worker must pay 
with their salaries. 
  [Roque] At least there can be an end to this black market. 
Is 
it the same for the underground economy, or is it a phenomenon 
that will be with us for many years to come? 
  [Rodriguez] I believe that when the economy is stabilized 
and 
there is a balance between supply and demand, or when supply is 
slightly higher than demand -- when that happens, and it happens 
in any economy because there is always a supply facing the flow 
of currency -- I believe, because I am realistic, that what is 
happening in other countries will happen -- an underground 
economy will exist and will be below the official market. I do 
not think it will disappear. 
  [Roque] The most important thing now is to keep producing, 
to 
gradually restore the value of our money, and to achieve market 
stability, as you said, so that people will feel relieved. 
  [Rodriguez] Yes. I believe this relief will be experienced 
after a given period -- following the implementation of measures 
-- not immediately. We have said several times on this program 
that measures cannot be considered a magic wand to yield 
immediate results in the economy. All economies have a delayed, 
not an immediate effect, unless drastic shock measures are 
adopted such as changing the monetary system. 
  [Roque] Yes. Well, I thank you for your participation in 
this 
program. Of course, I invite you to comment again on part three 
of The Underground Economy.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Rey Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] On 14 March, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina left 
en route to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, the third stop on his Asian 
tour, following a busy agenda in Myanmar. 
  In Phnom Penh, Robaina will meet with the president of the 
National Assembly and the prime minister of the Kingdom of 
Cambodia. This is the first official visit to Cambodia by a 
high-level official of the Cuban Government following the return 
to peace and stability in that nation. 
  In an exclusive interview with Radio Rebelde, Robaina spoke 
about the first phase of his Asian trip. 
  [Begin Robaina recording] Nowadays, we cannot speak of a 
worldwide diplomatic offensive that excludes such important 
regions. When we speak of important regions, we cannot forget 
this region, which is immensely wealthy, but which, in addition 
to that, has experienced a significant economic boom in recent 
years. 
  I believe that Cuba is in need today of many points of view. 
Cuba has many needs and these needs are possibilities for 
investment for many people. Undoubtedly, many of our needs 
represent opportunities for investment by countries in this 
region. 
  There is an undisputed economic boom in these countries that 
we need to analyze. We need to do this to see what works, what 
is truly adaptable to our circumstances. This is why I think we 
need to talk about this region. I believe that knocking on such 
doors as those of Indonesia, Malaysia, and India are venues, 
alternatives, and possibilities for work and exchanges under new 
game rules -- we are talking mutual exchange. 
  I do not want anyone to think that Cuba is going around 
asking for a handout. Cuba has many needs, but also many things 
it can offer the world and this region. I have found here great 
interest in possibilities, great willingness to open exchange 
possibilities in areas such as health, medicine, biotechnology, 
and sports -- as odd as it sounds. 
  There are many things that have resulted from our social 
investments that are of interest here, but have not been 
successful here. [end recording] 
  After Cambodia, Robaina will visit India, Malaysia, and 
Vietnam -- the last leg of his seven-country Asian tour.

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina has said that 
our country wants to increase cooperation and trade with other 
countries in order to be adequately reincorporated into the new 
international economic context, with the advantage that, 
notwithstanding its setbacks, Cuba also has things to offer. 
  In his tour of Asian countries, Robaina said that economic 
and trade prospects with Indonesia are very promising and that 
the two countries are also interested in strengthening the 
Nonaligned Movement. 
  Robaina added: During our visit to Bangkok we met with Thai 
Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri. The meeting allowed us to 
study formulas to increase our economic ties. Our next visits to 
Asia will seek the same objective. 
  Cuba is open to all forms of cooperation and, despite the 
U.S. pressure through the blockade, is day by day demonstrating 
its capacity to resist and its determination to succeed, Robaina 
concluded.

  [Excerpts] In Ciego de Avila, the first Youth Labor Army 
[EJT] brigade to cut 1 million arrobas of sugarcane in Cuba has 
received a letter of congratulations from Army General Raul 
Castro. 
  The average age of the brigade members is barely 18 years. 
However, they have been capable of the labor feat of cutting 1 
million arrobas in slightly less than 60 workdays. This result 
places them at the head of the EJT forces participating in the 
sugarcane harvest and is a repeat of last year's success. 
[passage omitted] 
  They have once again raised high their battalion flag -- the 
531st -- of the Batalla del Ubero Camp in Venezuela 
Municipality. The brigade members were happy to receive the 
letter of congratulations from Army Gen. Raul Castro for being 
an outstanding unit. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Armed Forces organization and personnel 
directorate [direccion de organizacion y personal de las Fuerzas 
Armadas Revolucionarias] has held its annual meeting. Concerning 
the important issue of recruiting, we interviewed Colonel Jorge 
Romero Alonso, chief of the Minfar [Ministry of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces] directorate: 
  [Begin Romero Alonso recording] The most significant aspect 
concerning recruitment is that, in comparison with 1992 and 
despite the situation in our country, we have achieved some 
progress. For example, recruitment this year was 1-percent 
higher and of better quality. We have had a better approach to 
problems affecting personnel, giving better treatment to the men. 
  This means that, notwithstanding the tense situation, people 
have increased their contribution of that which we already have: 
the love of work, the dedication, and the care that have 
characterized our workers. 
  This year we have had to make a tremendous effort concerning 
recruitment. We had to create a division here in Havana to work 
44 percent of the province's arable land. Today we have almost 
6,000 men. This was not included in any plan; it was done 
because of the emergency situation in the country. 
  This will help increase citrus production on the Isle of 
Youth, under the Giron victory plan, and tobacco production in

  [Text] Havana, 11 Mar (EFE) -- A group of 26 Cuban lawyers 
today requested approval by the People's Government National 
Assembly [ANPP] (parliament) of a "broad amnesty" to "help 
alleviate social tensions." 
  In a note delivered today to the press and signed by this 
group of lawyers who say they represent various ideas, the group 
states the request was made on 24 February in a letter addressed 
to the ANPP deputies who on that date had served one year since 
the time of their election. 
  The amnesty request includes prisoners for crimes "against 
state security" or for illegal departures or entries, those 
imprisoned for being a "menace to society," and those officials 
penalized while exercising their duties in office. 
  The lawyers state that in 35 years of the revolution, there 
has never been an amnesty, "even though it is included in Cuban 
legislation." The lawyers also say many of the individuals who 
will probably attend the conference with the Cuban community 
abroad, which the government has scheduled for April, "left the 
island where they were born for the same reasons why the others 
are imprisoned today." 
  The lawyers' letter concludes: "We are not moved by 
political passion or ideological stands, rather, by the purpose 
of helping alleviate social tensions of the fatherland with the 
resources of our profession and your solidarity."

  [Text] It has been confirmed on-site that Guatemalan Army 
troops have been sent to the Peten-Belize border area where 
Belizean soldiers and civilians are harassing the Guatemalans 
who live there. 
  The small town of Rio Blanco in Dolores, Peten Department, 
is 
the one most seriously affected by these actions. The homes of 
the residents -- who are mostly Quekchi Indians from Alta 
Verapaz -- have been burned by the invaders. This situation is 
nothing new in this village that was settled 15 years ago. The 
pressure by Belizean troops, however, began nine years ago. 
According to Salvador Jimenez, a man from Jalapa who has been 
living in this village for 15 years, a black woman came to this 
village several weeks ago and threatened to leave them with 
nothing during the corn harvest. 
  Francisco Javier Chen, a young Quekchi Indian who is a 
community leader, added that the Belizean soldiers have told 
them they are inside Belizean territory and that if they remain 
there their homes, crops, and even their lives are at stake. 
  The village, on the banks of the crystal-clear waters of the 
Blanco River and a little further out than Chiquibul, seems to 
be like the garden of Eden. There is abundant agricultural 
production, the weather is very nice, and the river waters are 
fresh. One can hear the cry of the Saraguate monkeys in the 
distance. 
  Speaking in Quekchi, Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez 
Morales held a lengthy conversation with the residents of the 
Rio Blanco village in Dolores, Peten, who complained of the 
actions by the soldiers from Belize. Guatemalan peasants 
wearing ragged shirts and rubber boots came down nearby paths, 
as well as women who were wearing the native outfit from Alta 
Verapaz and adolescents who wore colorful necklaces and carried 
sweaty children. 
  Likewise, sweaty soldiers walked down the same paths. They 
were wearing dirty camouflage uniforms because they have been in 
the area for a long time. Some of them carried light artillery 
weapons. Others carried M-16 rifles, while another carried radio 
equipment. 
  Enriquez, speaking in their language, urged the peasants to 
respect the law and not cross the border. "The Army is here to 
give you a helping hand. If for any reason you have to abandon 
the area, the government will find land to give you," he said. 
  The peasants said that they "harm no one and work in their 
fields." On some occasions they said they have found tombs, but 
they never touch them. They always leave them where they are. 
They complained that the Belizean soldiers accuse them of 
"opening the Maya tombs, but this is not true." 
  The dialogue between Enriquez and the community leader was 
interrupted several times when 10 persons speaking at the same 
time explained that they "are Guatemalans and they hope their 
government will do something for them at this time -- the worst 
of their lives -- because there has never been anything like 
this before in the jungle." 
  The troops from Military Zone No. 23, stationed in Santa 
Elena but with jurisdiction in Peten Department, are arriving at 
the border area between this department and Belize.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The URNG and Its Response to the Human Rights </F>
Issue"] 
  [Text] The round of negotiations between the government and 
the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] concluded 
Tuesday without the parties signing the human rights agreement, 
although progress was made on the topic of the timetable. As 
happened during the time of Jorge Serrano's Official Commission, 
the URNG General Command did not fully cooperate to enable the 
signing of the agreements. 
  When one wishes to analyze the causes of the new failure to 
advance in bringing peace to the country, it stands out that the 
hard line represented by Commanders Rolando Moran of the EGP 
[Poor People's Guerrilla Army] and Pablo Monsanto of the FAR 
[Rebel Armed Forces] is not in tune with "politicians" Carlos 
Gonzalez (PGT) [Guatemala Labor Party] and Gaspar Ilom [Rodrigo 
Asturias Amado] (ORPA) [Revolutionary Organization of the People 
in Arms], whose public statements are different. 
  The URNG leadership failed to realize that at the bargaining 
table they are being gratuitously offered more than they have 
been able to achieve militarily in the past three decades of 
armed struggle. At the very least, they had and have within 
their grasp the signing of a human rights agreement which would 
benefit all the people who are ultimately the ones bearing the 
cost of the war. 
  It is as if the Guatemalan insurgents were not taking into 
consideration that with these talks they are assured a greater 
active role, similar to one they would have attained had they 
reached a tie with the Guatemalan Army, as happened in El 
Salvador. It would seem the Guatemalan insurgents fail to 
realize that at this point in the 1990's internal strife is 
totally trivial and that our country could continue adrift or 
with a well-defined course with its dramas and tragedies, 
triumphs, joys, and comedies, even if the rebels continue their 
activities. 
  The guerrilla leaders should also keep in mind that a unique 
characteristic of Guatemala's social structure is that 
approximately 70 percent of the population is less than 30 years 
old and that most of the people live immersed in their daily 
problems influenced by the dizzying evolution of the world and 
are far from caring about knowing the roots of the ideological 
conflict that emerged in the 1960's. More important than that 
is to realize that although the government is giving the URNG a 
deal similar to the one the Salvadoran Government accorded the 
FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front], the conditions 
prevailing in each case are radically different. For example, 
El Salvador had a war economy. The U.S. subsidy that maintained 
the conflict between the Army and the rebels was large; 
infrastructure was 90 percent destroyed; the need for financial 
resources for reconstruction following the war was and is more 
than enormous; elections were sabotaged by over 80 percent; the 
correlation of forces between the Army and rebels was evident; 
over 90 percent of local governments in the strife-torn areas 
were dissolved; a military balance existed; the rebels 
controlled liberated zones; the rebels had a force comparable in 
many cases with the Army; they had sophisticated weaponry with a 
large-scale capacity for offensive operations that they took to 
San Salvador, even to [Salvadoran President] Cristiani's home; 
and among other things they had the clear support and acceptance 
of the people. 
  In making a comparative analysis and drawing parallels 
between the neighboring country's situation and ours, it is easy 
to see the differences are marked and substantial. 
  To conclude, the shortsighted guerrillas and the government 
give the impression that they have forgotten that more important 
than signing a peace accord and the absence of an armed 
confrontation, it is essential to hasten a solution to the 
problems of poverty that hurt over eight out of every 10 
Guatemalans. As this century draws to an end, it is basic to 
create an equal opportunity framework for all Guatemalans that 
ensures each citizen has the same starting point when he begins 
his dramatic struggle for a more dignified life.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 9 Mar (DPA) -- The Honduran military 
today accepted the 10-percent cut in the defense budget ordered 
by President Carlos Roberto Reina. General Reynaldo Andino 
Flores, defense and public security minister, said the Honduran 
Armed Forces will make their share of sacrifices by accepting 
their budget cut. 
  The budget earmarked for defense in 1994 totals over 250 
million lempiras (a little over $30 million), as approved by the 
Congress. Independent sources, however, indicated that in 
reality the defense budget is more than 600 million lempiras 
(over $70 million), since the military budget is increased 
through internal transfer mechanisms. 
  On Monday, President Reina announced a 10-percent reduction 
in the general budget of the central government and autonomous 
institutions. The entire public budget, including the central 
government and autonomous institutions, totals approximately 12 
billion lempiras ($1.5 billion), meaning 1.2 billion lempiras 
($150 million) will be cut from the budget.

<F P=106> [Article by Jorge Katin] </F>
  [Text] Two letters sent by the president of the Republic to 
the National Assembly yesterday afternoon led to violent 
protests among the deputies of the various parties because the 
Executive Branch threatened to "take actions" if the deputies 
continue to discuss fiscal legislation. 
  The first letter reached the National Assembly at noon and 
in 
it, President Chamorro stated she would not sign -- approve -- 
the law on tax exemptions on school supplies and medicine for 
humans approved by the Assembly in mid-February, although she 
said she would not veto it either. "To sign such a bill would 
be a violation of the Constitution and the mechanism to pass 
fiscal legislation which had already been institutionalized," 
the president said. She added the Executive Branch has the 
exclusive power to legislate on fiscal matters according to 
Article 150 of the Constitution. The president also added that 
"she is analyzing the measures that need to be implemented to 
compensate for the loss in the collection of taxes." 
  The letter was described as "impertinent and disrespectful" 
by the members of the Legislative Branch. The Board of 
Directors, in response, decided to enact the law that same week. 
The UNO deputies said they supported the Board's decision to 
order the publication of the aforementioned law. 
  The storm caused by the first letter had not died out when 
Frank Duarte, the secretary of the Board of Directors, read the 
second letter, this time against the law on public bids for 
fishing licenses. In the letter, the president states that by 
means of presidential decree "she has decided to create a 
National Fishing and Aquaculture Commission," thereby 
overstepping the bounds of the commission created for this 
purpose by the Law on Fishing Bids or Law 165. 
  Many of the deputies considered this to be a "deep crisis" 
and an "open confrontation" with the Executive Branch. 
Meanwhile presidency sources downplayed the confrontation by 
pointing out that there is no such "crisis" between both 
branches of government. Others, however, described it as the 
president's "maneuver" prior to the arrival of the IMF 
delegation. 
<H5>  Assembly Will Determine Ways To Respond </H5>
  "Antonio Lacayo is trying to sell the IMF the idea that the 
National Assembly is to blame for not complying with the 
guidelines proposed by the IMF," some deputies said. More than 
20 deputies spoke rejecting the contents of the letters sent by 
President Chamorro. "It is a provocation and an attempt to make 
us take measures by insulting our intelligence," according to 
Danilo Aguirre, a Sandinist National Liberation Front deputy. 
<H5>  Rosales Blames Delaney </H5>
  Aguirre proposed the creation of a special commission that 
would be in charge of suggesting to the Board of Directors a 
series of measures that could be taken in view of the 
"provocation" by the Executive Branch. Roberto Urroz from the 
Nicaraguan Democratic Movement and Omar Cabezas from the FSLN 
proposed accelerating the constitutional reform process as a 
response to "the Executive Branch's disrespect." According to 
Deputy Cabezas, the measures announced by the president in her 
second letter are aimed at protecting the "fishing czars." 
  Finally the deputies unanimously decided not to get ahead of 
themselves and appointed a special commission made up of the 
members of the Board of Directors of the Economic and Legal 
Affairs Commission to draft a proposal with the measures that 
could be taken. 
  Labor Minister Francisco Rosales, who observed the debates 
and the deputies' reactions closely, said both jokingly and 
seriously that "these are the crazy acts of Deputy Presidency 
Minister Tomas Delaney. Rosales said that Delaney "should have 
resorted to the Supreme Court" so that the Judicial Branch could 
determine if it is in the National Assembly's power to legislate 
fiscal matters. 
  Presidency sources said that President Chamorro, who 
traveled 
to Chile yesterday, had drafted two more letters that would be 
sent to the National Assembly today.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Casado] </F>
  [Text] U.S. Vice President Al Gore will arrived in Brasilia 
on 21 March. He will invite President Itamar Franco to the 
hemispheric summit that will meet in the next few months. 
  Gore's agenda also includes a debate with political leaders, 
entrepreneurs, and environmentalists, possibly with radio and 
television coverage. 
  It is one form of doing politics based on the tradition of 
British colonizers who promoted debates with communities before 
making decisions. 
  The Clinton administration has started doing that, 
domestically. Gore wants to do it in Brasilia. 
  The issue will be a single one during his meeting with 
Itamar 
Franco, during the summit meeting or during the public debate: 
the Americas' integration. 
  The issue has become vital to the United States' future 
leadership, in the Clinton government's view. 
  Jeffrey Garten, former banker and Wall Street broker and 
current U.S. commerce under secretary for international trade, 
summarized it this way: "Our future capacity to compete, create 
jobs, and remain world leaders will depend on our capacity to 
succeed in the larger emerging markets." 
  For Washington there are three "large emerging markets" in 
Latin America: Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico. 
  The candidates to succeed President Itamar Franco should 
begin pondering this new U.S. diplomatic offensive in Latin 
America that started with the signing of the free trade 
agreement with Mexico. 
  It is crucial for any political power project in the region. 
It is the main condition for any government such as the 
Brazilian Government, which is betting on an "autonomous" 
foreign policy based on the full dominion of the Amazon basin 
(in the north) and the River Plate basin (in the south). 
  The "Gore mission" is an act that intends to prepare the 
Latin American political arena for the application of the new 
foreign relations "model" that Washington developed with Mexico 
and Canada during NAFTA's negotiations. 
  Gore's agenda during his 48 hours in Latin America is 
eloquent: Before coming to Brasilia he will travel to Buenos 
Aires. In Buenos Aires he is scheduled to give a strong speech 
at the World Telecommunications Conference -- the most coveted 
business circle in the world. 
  He will speak about "reinventing governments" through a 
reduction of the state role in the economy. He should not repeat 
the same speech in Brazil. The State Department is afraid of 
hurting the feelings of nationalists who might possibly identify 
Gore's words with "an interference in domestic affairs" at a 
moment Congress is trying to revise the Constitution. 
  In Buenos Aires, the U.S. vice president must confirm the 
possibility of closing with Argentina, possibly this year, the 
first protocols on free trade. 
  That "strategy with Argentina," as the U.S. bureaucracy 
defines it, will represent progress in the direction of a common 
commercial promotion project (environmental technology and spare 
parts); the sale of capital goods, telecommunications equipment, 
transportation, and basic sanitation with assured financing; 
assistance in the financial sector's deregulation; and 
"technological cooperation" in urban and environmental 
engineering and biotechnology. 
  It is a "package" in NAFTA's direction with the White 
House's 
stamp on it and the parallel support of multilateral agencies 
such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. 
  Franco's successor will be installed on 1 January 1995. That 
day, the borders of the Common Market of the South [Mercosur] 
will open up. 
  Mercosur, as well as NAFTA, are already part of the scenery. 
Both projects have problems, but they might represent converging 
solutions. 
  It will depend exclusively on the capacity of rulers to use 
these projects as political instruments for introducing changes 
in this absurd picture of income distribution that is 
threatening the future of democracy in Latin America. 
  The alternative is a political confrontation.

"Unexpected Aggression"] 
  [Text] When relations between Brazil and the United States 
seem to be on the way to normalization, areas of friction that 
have almost been forgotten reappear. It is known that the human 
rights issue has always been taboo for our governments, and it 
is also known that the State Department is forced by law to send 
to the U.S. Congress a report on the human rights situation in 
the entire world. Any reference to Brazil in that report is 
received in Brasilia with outrage even, and the executive branch 
does not seem to understand that the human rights issue is a 
universal concern. 
  Although no one expected it, a top U.S. Government official 
touched on this issue in rude language during a meeting of the 
UN Human Rights Commission. But this is what happened in Vienna 
last week. We were described as a country where "street children 
go around in the garbage looking for food and are hunted for 
sport." Vivian Derryck went even further, saying "that 
negligence is too close to savagery to be called anything else." 
  During the Collor administration, the Foreign Ministry 
feared 
the problem of children and human rights would allow a broad 
international campaign against Brazil like the campaign carried 
out against the Medici administration in relation to the 
massacre of Indians. 
  Unfortunately, by the inertia of the government and the 
indifference of broad sectors of society, there are still cases 
that, taken out of context, allow speeches like Mrs. Derryck's 
to be delivered to audiences that receive them well despite the 
prompt and harsh answers from the Brazilian representatives. 
Even now in Londrina there was an ad published in a newspaper 
inciting the killing of minors involved in holdups. The 
psychopathy of the ones who ran the ad is not taken into account 
by the people in the nongovernmental organizations and the U.S. 
diplomatic corps, which writes the human rights report. In fact, 
this is similar to the "hunted for sport" referred to in the 
Candelaria massacre. When in international meetings the real 
efforts made by nongovernmental civilian organizations, 
different churches, and officials of some states to improve the 
situation of children are ignored, it is natural for the federal 
government to feel justly hurt by the abuse typical of student 
body elections, which can only be replied to by denying the 
moral authority of the U.S. Government to make this type of 
abuse. Unfortunately, however, this is the situation we will 
have to live with for many years. Mainly because the increase of 
juvenile crime in association with the economic crisis, 
unemployment, and the indifference to moral values are making 
people insensible and inclined to deal with this problem in the 
simplistic manner, and many times with the complicity of 
officials who are blind to everything.

  [Text] The first thing Alexis Stepanenko did after being 
sworn in as mines and energy minister yesterday was to dismiss 
Gastao Luis de Andrade, director of the National Water and 
Electric Power Department (DNAEE), who is held responsible for 
the average 43.2 percent increase in electric power rates. The 
increase annoyed President Itamar Franco, who demanded that 
measures be taken. Before learning that he had been dismissed, 
Gastao asserted that the rate hikes had been suggested by Jose 
Milton Dallari, special Finance Ministry adviser on pricing 
policies. 
  Franco demanded that it be determined who was responsible 
for 
the increase. From that point on, those responsible for pricing 
policy in the Finance Ministry and in the Mines and Energy 
Ministry tried to dodge responsibility. Finance Minister 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso himself began to absolve his advisers 
of blame. He asserted: "Neither I nor Dallari authorized this 
increase. The reasons for it should be sought in the Mines and 
Energy Ministry." 
  Yesterday Fernando Henrique said the price adjustment was 
"unacceptable": "Rates were increased without my approval. 
Someone is going to have to pay for this, because it goes 
against the stabilization plan." 
  According to Cardoso, an agreement between the Finance 
Ministry, the DNAEE, and the public energy contractors estimated 
that the increase should be based on the average increases of 
the past four months, which would have been approximately 38 
percent. According to the minister's estimates, electric power 
rates accumulated a real increase of 8.6 percent last October. 
  Stepanenko refused to comment on the reasons that compelled 
him to dismiss Gastao. He said: "I made the decision in 
exercise of my authority, and do not wish to discuss it." 
Stepanenko is now trying to figure out what to do with the 
increase: He can either cancel it, or compensate for it in the 
next adjustment. 
  Gastao defended himself: "The initial order was to transform 
rates into URV's [real value units]. But we then received a 
counter order not to do so, and to continue using the parametric 
formula. That order came from Dallari." The parametric formula 
takes into account the operational costs of each of the 
enterprises of this sector. 
  Israel Vargas stood up for his director: "Gastao was in 
constant contact with the Finance Ministry. The minister and I 
were probably duped in our good faith by factors beyond our 
control."

  [Excerpt] Brasilia -- The National Accounting Office (TCU) 
ordered an investigation on 3 March to find out who diverted 
some $300 million from the Agricultural Activities Support 
Program (Proagro) [Programa de Garantia da Atividade 
Agropecuaria]. During a special inspection, TCU personnel 
discovered that Proagro is not supervised. Ademar Guisi, the 
TCU rapporteur for the case, was surprised at the results of the 
inspection. 
  He said: "Proagro is totally uncoordinated, disorganized, 
and 
is not supervised. This has turned Proagro into a veritable 
Pandora's box." 
  Proagro, which is managed by the Central Bank, was created 
to 
cover farmers' debts to banks whenever bad crops occurred due to 
acts of nature. TCU personnel found various irregularities, 
such as payment for nonexistent liabilities. Most of the 
diverted funds went out this way. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The National Privatization Program (PND) Executive 
Committee yesterday set a new date for the Embraer [Brazilian 
Aeronautics Company] privatization auction: 20 May. As the 
final adjustments before the sale were only approved by the 
government last week, the PND Executive Committee only managed 
to establish the method and the minimum price for the state-run 
company during yesterday's meeting. The auction had initially 
been scheduled for 24 March. The PND Executive Committee thus 
hopes to have enough time to release the privatization's 
resolution. 
  The auction will be held at the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange 
(Bovespa), where 60 percent of Embraer's capital will be 
auctioned for about $200 million. The privatization will be 
completed if 85 percent of the stock offered, involving 51 
percent of the company's capital, is sold. The Federal 
Government (Aeronautics Ministry) will retain 20 percent of the 
stock, employees will be entitled to 10 percent, and the rest 
will be sold to the public. The recommendation of the PND 
Executive Committee, which must be approved by President Itamar 
Franco, does not require payment in currency and does not 
exclude the participation of foreign capital. 
  The PND Executive Committee's proposal contemplates for the 
first time in the privatization program the pre-selection of 
bidders by the Aeronautics Ministry, which will also be entitled 
to golden shares [preceding two words in English] (special 
stock) that carry the right to veto issues described as 
strategic -- like corporate changes, changes in and the drawing 
up of military programs, and transfers in the control of 
majority stock. PND Executive Committee Chairman Andre Franco 
Montoro Filho said these rules have been established because 
Embraer is a strategic aviation company. 
  Montoro Filho reported that the value of the company is 
estimated at $510.3 million, plus $215 million in debts that 
must be accepted by the future majority stock holders. Thus, 
the state-run company's minimum price has dropped to $295.3 
million. Montoro Filho added that the capital will be increased 
by $30 million, but the federal government will not underwrite 
the stock. Buyers will also have to commit themselves to 
purchase this stock because the auction will take place during 
the stock subscription period.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 12 Mar (NA) -- Argentina has taken a 
basic step toward joining the OECD as a full-fledged member by 
formalizing its entry into the OECD Development Center. The 
OECD groups the developed nations. 
  Argentina's entry was formalized after the signing of notes 
at the OECD headquarters in Paris by OECD Secretary Jean Claude 
Paye and Argentine Ambassador to France Juan Archibaldo Lanus, 
thus completing the Foreign Ministry's initial negotiations. 
  Therefore, Argentina has become the first Latin American 
country to be invited to actively participate in the OECD 
Development Center, established in 1962 with the goal of 
favoring an exchange of know-how among nations in order to 
devise general economic policies. 
  The Development Center groups the democratic countries that 
have more developed economies; the entry requirements include, 
among others, the existence of a stable democratic system, 
respect for human rights, and solid economic stability. 
  The Argentine ambassador to France said: "Argentina's entry 
into the OECD Development Center is the result of Argentina's 
change and transformation." 
  The OECD, described as the "Club of the Powerful," was the 
successor to an organization established to administer the 
Marshall Plan funds for the reconstruction of countries like 
Germany and West Europe after World War II. 
  In a communique, the Foreign Ministry emphasized that the 
document's signing "agrees with the policy implemented by the 
Foreign Ministry and the government in its foreign relations, 
involving Argentine withdrawal from the list of nonaligned 
countries first and now entry into the OECD." 
  The groups Argentina was invited to join are involved in 
reviewing privatizations, tax policy, and trade relations, among 
other issues.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 13 Mar (NA) -- Arriving on an official 
four-day visit today, UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
emphasized Argentina's significant role in the UN peace-keeping 
projects. 
  He arrived this morning at the Ezeiza international airport. 
He will ask Argentine President Carlos Menem to send more 
troops to former Yugoslavia during a meeting tomorrow. 
  In remarks to a Buenos Aires newspaper, Butrus-Ghali noted 
that the United Nations wants the Argentine Government to send 
an additional battalion of blue helmets to join those already in 
Croatia. 
  Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella welcomed the Egyptian 
diplomat, emphasized the "esteemed value" of the visit, and 
confirmed Argentina's desire to continue participating in the UN 
peace-keeping missions. 
  Issues like the UN debt following the various deployments of 
Argentine blue helmets will also be discussed during the visit. 
  The formation of an international force to struggle against 
hunger -- the White Helmets -- will also be reviewed. 
  During the meeting with Menem tomorrow, an agreement to 
assist the Mothers, Infants, and Nutrition Program [Programa 
Materno Infantil y Nutricion] (PROMIN), financed by the World 
Bank, will also be signed.

  [Text] President Carlos Menem said that he was "in complete 
agreement" with a document released on Wednesday [9 March] by 
the Catholic Church that outlined its recommendations for the 
reformed Constitution including a guarantee of greater 
separation of the three branches of government. 
  The President also said during a press conference at 
Government House that "nothing could be decided" about Raul 
Matera, the number two candidate on the ruling Justicialist 
Party's Federal Capital slate of potential delegates to the 
Constituent Assembly, until a complete diagnosis was made. 
  Matera was admitted to the Otamendi Clinic on Wednesday with 
pneumonia. Menem added he had tried to visit Matera, who is also 
science and technology secretary and serves as the head of the 
city Peronist Party. 
  At the same time the President said he supported the concept 
of a separation of powers but did not directly respond to the 
Episcopal Conference of bishops' assertion that the executive 
branch had experienced "uncontrolled growth" during his term. 
  However, he said, any final decision "depends fundamentally 
on what the people say through the reform process under way." He 
added that Church-state relations were "normal." 
  In their statement the bishops left open the possibility 
that 
future presidents might be of different religions -- currently 
the head of state is required under the Constitution to be a 
practicing Catholic -- but rejected the possibility of an 
atheist leading the country. 
  Reacting to that last statement Lomas de Zamora Suffragan 
Bishop Juan Carlos Maccarone yesterday [10 March] stated that 
the Church had in fact "left open" the issue of the head of 
state's religion because it was not a priority and did not have 
a mandate from the Episcopal Conference. 
  Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf meanwhile declined to 
comment on the Church statement, saying that was the duty of the 
Foreign Ministry's religion department. 
  Legal and Technical Secretary Carlos Corach, the leading 
candidate on the ruling Justicialist Party's slate of potential 
delegates to the Constituent Assembly, took issue with the 
bishop's statement on the separation of powers. 
  "The executive branch has not increased its powers," he 
said. 
  Among the opposition the Radical National Committee, in a 
statement signed by party Chairman Raul Alfonsin, said the 
bishops' declaration "contributes to the general consensus" 
required for reform. 
  Alfonsin added that the Church's concern for the growth in 
the executive branch's powers "without a doubt coincides" with 
his own party's worries. 
  Differing with the Church was the Argentine Society for 
Gay-Lesbian Integration [SIGLA], which warned that the Catholic 
Church's stance "puts the civil rights and the rights of 
minorities at risk." 
  SIGLA noted in a statement issued yesterday that "the 
Catholic Church is endowed with privileges that the other 
religions lack." 
  In other political news: 
  -- Dario Cipollini, the former secretary for ex-Radical 
Deputy Luis Medina Allende, was summoned to testify yesterday in 
court on charges he bribed Peronist legislators during Cordoba's 
1986 Constituent Assembly. 
  -- The Trotskyist Left Socialist Front (FIS) yesterday 
presented its list of candidates for the April 10 Constituent 
Assembly election. The coalition, which opposes constitutional 
reform, will be led by Movement Toward Socialism's Nora Ciappone 
and former Socialist Workers Movement Deputy Luis Zamora.

  [Excerpt] President Carlos Menem gave his firm backing to 
businessmen Francisco Macri yesterday [10 March], saying he had 
complete faith in his honesty and work ethic. The remarks came 
moments before it transpired that Macri would be summoned to 
court on charges of tax evasion while importing cars to the 
country. 
  "Nobody can doubt that Francisco Macri is one of the people 
to have brought the highest amount of investment into the 
country and that he has breathed new life into the car 
industry," Menem told reporters in Government House before 
leaving for Chile yesterday to witness today's inauguration of 
new Chilean President Eduardo Frei. 
  However he added that his personal view should in no way 
influence the decision of the national courts and in particular 
that of Federal Judge Roberto Marquevich, who has been 
investigating the claims of tax evasion. 
  In reference to other news Menem touched upon the 
controversy 
surrounding alleged bribes demanded by the PAMI [Comprehensive 
Medical Assistance Plan] pensioners medical plan, saying that 
the accusations against the organization's head, Matilde 
Menendez, were part of a "scaremongering" campaign. 
  He also hinted that Menendez, who will be standing for 
election to the Constituent Assembly on April 10 on behalf of 
the Justicialist Party in the Federal Capital, was being 
targeted as part of a political witch-hunt. 
  "These (accusations) will continue to be bandied about by 
real mafiosos who are part of the political set-up and are 
intent upon damaging her candidacy," Menem told reporters.

  [Text] In a widely expected move the General Labour 
Confederation's [CGT] extraordinary congress yesterday [10 
March] elected SUPE [United Trade Union of State Petroleum 
Workers] petrol workers union leader Alberto Cassia as new 
secretary-general. 
  The CGT also chose new members to its Directive Council, 
which is dominated by pro-government unions and is expected to 
continue its negotiations with the Justicialist administration. 
  "It is not time to throw stones or make strikes, and we will 
favour dialogue over all things," 55-year-old Alberto Cassia 
said after being sworn in as CGT head. Cassia, a former deputy, 
has lead the union in Mendoza and has close ties with ex-SUPE 
head Diego Ibanez, who is a close friend of President Carlos 
Menem's. Cassia has also had a place as a workers representative 
on the state oil company YPF's [Government Oil Deposits] board 
of directors. 
  The new leadership does not include any members of either 
the 
breakaway Argentine Workers Movement or the anti-government 
Argentine Workers Congress. Neither group attended the gathering 
staged in the Federal Capital at the Parque Norte sports centre. 
  Luis Barrionuevo, the UTGRA [Argentine Union of Restaurant 
Workers] restaurant workers union leader, is another prominent 
unionist that does not have a place on the new Directive Council. 
  AB [Banking Association] bank clerks union leader Juan Jose 
Zanola is the CGT's joint secretary general. The other 22 places 
on the council are shared among members of the staunch 
pro-government union and the moderate pro-government unions that 
negotiated Cassia's candidacy prior to the Congress. 
  The powerful UOM [Metalworkers Union] metal workers union 
significantly has chosen to keep its participation in the new 
CGT at a minimum: La Matanza UOM leader Carlos Gdansky was 
appointed to the minor post of register secretary. 
  UOM metal workers union leader Lorenzo Miguel said that 
"although we are friends of the President (Carlos Menem) we are 
independent enough to defend the rights of the workers." 
  Cassia, in turn, said that he will immediately request a 
meeting with Menem and Labour Minister Armando Caro Figueroa. 
  "(The CGT), shares the socio-economic model of Carlos 
Menem's 
government with the logical disagreements that organized labour 
has with certain official plans that affect workers rights," 
Cassia told a local news agency. He added that the CGT "will, if 
necessary, use the right to strike." 
  Organizers said that 1,186 delegates of 171 trade unions 
participated in the Congress in which the only ticket presented 
was the one headed by Cassia. 
  In other labour news: 
  Members of the Democratic Centre Union's Lower House caucus 
yesterday pledged their support for the government's labour 
reform bill in a meeting with Caro Figueroa. 
  -- The Rosario Newspaper Union held a silent march last 
night 
in support of La Capital Editor Alberto Vila Ortiz and his 
family, who have been the subject of multiple threats. 
  Santiago del Estero municipal workers defied an order by 
Federal Trustee and launched an indefinite strike in demand of 
higher wages, while senior citizens marched to draw attention to 
their pension claims.

  [Text] Santiago del Estero--The workers who had taken over 
a textile firm in this city and who were evicted last Thursday 
described the police crackdown on them as "savage" and charged 
that "the order was given by Secretary of Internal Security 
Andres Antonietti." Interior Minister Jorge Busti also 
criticized the action. 
  Santiago del Estero Radical Party members predicted, for 
their part, that the federal overseer, Juan Schiaretti, "will 
come to the same end as his predecessors" and cautioned that the 
disturbances last December were not "the culmination of a 
process but rather a wake-up call." 
  Nine workers at the company Textil Santiaguena, which is 
located in the Huaico Hondo neighborhood, were wounded by the 
rubber bullets or overcome by the tear gas used during the 
evacuation of the plant, which had been ordered by Judge Silvia 
de Ferreyra Lesye and carried out by the Infantry Corps of the 
provincial police. 
  The workers said that they had occupied the plant "in 
defense 
of jobs" inasmuch as the firm had declared bankruptcy and the 
property had been auctioned off. 
  At a press conference after the eviction the workers blamed 
the police crackdown on Brigadier Antonietti and said that the 
agents who had taken part in the maneuver "received extra pay to 
dislodge us by whatever means." 
  One of the evicted workers related that "the chief of the 
Infantry Corps, Julio Olivera, made me kneel down, aimed his 
service weapon at my head, and then fired to one side. The blast 
made me pass out and damaged my hearing." 
  The demonstrators also criticized the judge: "She deceived 
all of us workers by saying that she had decided to give us five 
days and then ordering the eviction a few hours later." 
  In remarks to a Buenos Aires radio station, Minister Busti 
described as "regrettable the way in which the police took 
action at the textile plant" and announced that he had ordered 
preliminary proceedings opened against Olivera for the means 
that he had used to regain control of the plant. 
  Moreover, the Province Committee of the Radical Civic Union 
(UCR) asserted in a press release that overseer Schiaretti "will 
come to the same end as his predecessors," adding that he "is 
mistaken if he still thinks that what happened in December was 
the culmination of a process, inasmuch as it was only a wake-up 
call." 
  The Santiago del Estero UCR, led by National Deputy Jose 
Zavalia, indicated that "Schiaretti is just as arrogant and deaf 
as his predecessors," asserting that the demands of the people 
"are still unmet." 
<H5>  Legal Insecurity </H5>
  Former Federal Judge Federico Pinto Kramer charged yesterday 
in this city that "legal insecurity in Santiago del Estero is 
becoming increasingly self-evident," adding that "the desire of 
some judges to be in the limelight casts suspicion on court 
actions and confuses public opinion with false news." 
  At a press conference the well-known attorney questioned the 
new arrest warrant issued for his client, former government 
spokesman Miguel Brevetta Rodriguez, who has been accused of 
signing a 300,000-peso advertising contract with a nonexistent 
Tucuman firm. 
  Former Governor Carlos Mujica and his interior minister, 
Angel Bagli, are also at large in connection with this case. 
  Pinto Kramer gave newsmen photocopies of the alleged 
contract 
and asserted that it was not signed with a dummy company. "The 
contract was signed with a well-known advertising firm on behalf 
of a printing house," he said. 
  The former judge indicated that "there is a black smoke 
screen to confuse instead of clarify" and charged that "four 
months into the investigation the proceedings are still being 
kept confidential and there is more talk than action." 
  In addition, the former federal judge also lashed out at the 
federal overseer, Juan Schiaretti, recalling that he had said 
that he "would fill the jails." "With whom?" Pinto Kramer said 
sarcastically, then asserting that "so far the Mujica 
administration seems to be the most conscientious in recent 
years." 
  Mujica resigned late last October amid charges of 
embezzlement and was replaced by Deputy Governor Fernando Lobo. 
  Brevetta Rodriguez's and Mujica's homes are among the houses 
and public buildings that have been looted and burned.

  [Text] La Paz, 13 Dec (EFE) -- Various politicians said 
today that former Bolivian President Luis Garcia Meza, who was 
detained in Brazil, could involve many of the active members of 
Bolivian politics in the actions of his de facto government 
(1980-1981) for which he was sentenced to 30 years in prison. 
  Deputy Benjamin Miguel of the Christian Democratic Party 
(PDC) said today that Garcia Meza is quite "smart to do that ... 
to try to stain with his accusations many people who now appear 
to be democrats and respectful of the Constitution but who 
encouraged the military dictatorships." 
  Garcia Meza, who was detained on 11 March by Brazilian 
police 
in Sao Paulo, said: "I am paying for the things others did and I 
will prove it." 
  Deputy Miguel, who lived in exile during the Garcia Meza 
government, said, "the former dictator has nothing to lose" and 
he will try to get the greatest political advantage from his 
declarations before and after he is extradited to Bolivia. 
  The La Paz morning daily HOY says in an editorial on 12 
March 
that there is "fear of Garcia Meza," and that "this time the 
people are not the ones who are afraid of this character, but 
his old allies and Bolivian politicians who are about to get 
another bucket of water" from the former dictator. 
  Juan del Granado, a lawyer in the civic lawsuit of the 
so-called "Trial of the Century" against Garcia Meza that lasted 
seven years, labeled the former dictator a "liar and forgetful." 
He said, however, that whatever Garcia Meza says will serve to 
open the case again against new people who were involved in the 
criminals acts committed by the former general. 
  Miguel Urioste, leader of the Free Bolivia Movement (MBL) 
that is in the government coalition, said that "the two previous 
governments protected the former dictator" in reference to 
former President Victor Paz Estenssoro (1985-1989) and Jaime Paz 
Zamora (1989-1993). The first because it let him go and the 
second because it did not want to arrest him. 
  Urioste added: "I hope Garcia Meza is man enough to accuse 
his accomplices, accessories, and protectors, and that the heads 
that must roll begin to roll." 
  The MBL announced that it will propose in the next few days 
that the Constitution, Justice, and Judicial Police Committee of 
the Chamber of Deputies investigate the protection given to 
Garcia Meza by people linked to current Bolivian politics and 
diplomacy. 
  Deputy Eduardo Paz of the opposition Conscience of the 
Fatherland (Condepa) said that all those who cooperated with the 
Garcia Meza government should be "unmasked." He supports any 
initiative to identify the former dictator's accessories during 
the five years he remained a fugitive from justice. 
  According to a "confidential" report released by the local 
FIDES news agency, more than 100 people have covered up for 
Garcia Meza in Bolivia including soldiers, congressmen, close 
friends, relatives, and people who benefited in administrative 
and political positions during the de facto government from July 
1980 to August 1981. 
  The Bolivian Supreme Court sentenced Garcia Meza on 21 April 
1993 to the stiffest sentence, 30 years in jail, for nine crimes 
of sedition, murder, malfeasance, and stealing government 
property.

  [Text] President Eduardo Frei said today before more than 
100 national and foreign business people that Chile will not 
sacrifice its political and social stability for the sole 
purpose of achieving economic growth. Jose Miguel Alfaro has a 
live report from La Moneda Palace: 
  [Alfaro] Good afternoon, in an unusual event in our history 
President Frei began his administration by meeting with business 
people from 20 countries as a demonstration of the new 
government's intention to continue the process of introducing 
Chile to the international market. Let us look at the report we 
prepared: 
  [Begin recording] [Alfaro] The president began the first day 
of his administration early this morning in La Moneda Palace. He 
then went to Carreras Hotel to open a meeting with the business 
people. He reiterated that it is a moral responsibility and an 
important economic objective for his government to eradicate 
extreme poverty. To do that he said it is necessary that Chile 
double its income during the next decade. 
  [Frei, in progress] ...of what I said, I do not want to fail 
to mention that in Chile we are not willing to sacrifice our 
culture or our national identity or the values of equity or 
solidarity or deteriorate the qualify of our standard of living 
and environment or put our political and social stability at 
stake for the sole purpose of achieving economic growth. 
  [Alfaro] President Frei concluded his speech by inviting the 
business people to do business in the country, and in this 
manner cooperate with the progress of Chile. He said the larger 
private investment is, the larger the public investment to 
overcome poverty will be. After President Frei finished his 
speech, the speakers were Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat, 
Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia, and Public Works Minister 
Ricardo Lagos. The following is a report from Arturo Harlen. 
  [Harlen] More than 100 of the most important world business 
people are meeting in Carreras Hotel this morning. They are 
getting familiar with the Chilean conditions for foreign 
investment. This meeting gave an opportunity to the new 
ministers from the economic area to disclose their policies. 
Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat pointed out the private sector's 
participation in the country's development and explained the 
benefits offered by Chile to foreign investors. He noted that 
the new economic officials have made a commitment to maintain 
clear rules and the country's stability, especially for 
investors. 
  [Aninat] The stability of the rules, the continuity of 
growth, and the importance of investment and savings to create 
more and better jobs are basic commitments for this government. 
The Finance Ministry I head and the economic team in general 
will not fail to maintain the stability that was achieved with 
so much effort in the country. 
  [Harlen] Public Works Minister Ricardo Lagos said this 
government has the challenge of providing the country with an 
infrastructure compatible with a growth with social justice. He 
noted that ports, airports, and highways must be modernized. He 
said he has identified about 1,600 projects that are essential 
to achieve development. He said a large part of these projects 
will be given to private companies for their construction, which 
means a great opportunity for new business deals. Finance 
Minister Eduardo Aninat indicated that growth close to 4.5 
percent is expected this year and that with this growth Chile 
will be completing 11 years of continuous economic growth. [end 
recording] 
  [Alfaro] I would like to note that President Frei will hold 
a 
luncheon for the participants of the meeting with world business 
people in the next few minutes. This is all the information I 
have from La Moneda Palace. Back to the studio.

  [Excerpt] Fruit Exporters Association President Ronald Bown 
and Fruits Producers Federation President Ricardo Ariztia have 
expressed satisfaction over the decision handed down on 24 
February by the Philadelphia Appellate Court rejecting the 
jurisdiction immunity requested by the U.S. Government in the 
case of the "poisoned grapes" case. They said the only concrete 
possibility now is to continue the trial "come what may." 
  The two executives discard the possibility of reaching 
agreement with the Clinton administration. During recent 
negotiations with the Chilean Foreign Ministry, the U.S. 
Administration offered grants and general benefits that do not 
compensate the damage suffered by that sector. They noted they 
have not accepted this solution. 
  Ariztia said the judicial process involves about 2,200 
producers and 108 export companies. He added that the private 
sector has invested more than $3 million in the legal process 
and that enough resources are left to carry on for at least one 
more year. Bown said the private fruit producers and exporters 
have demanded an indemnity of $212 million, while some shipping 
lines like the Sudamericana and importers in the United States 
want $230 million. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview by Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa </F>
Serrano by unidentified reporter; date and place not given -- 
live or recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Reporter] Referring to some 
specific countries, it seems the path toward the resumption of 
diplomatic relations with Bolivia is being opened. Some people 
believe Cuba's isolation has hurt the Cuban people. What 
chances are there of resuming diplomatic relations with Bolivia 
and of establishing relations, at an ambassadorial level, with 
Cuba? 
  [Figueroa] I believe the first consideration in diplomatic 
relations are Chilean interests. Chile maintains relations with 
those countries that can help us to attain the 
political-economic objectives we seek. This must be considered 
when thinking about resuming relations. In the case of Bolivia, 
they broke relations with Chile, therefore, it is up to them to 
resume relations. In the case of Bolivia there is a climate of 
confidence, friendship, and even an economic cooperation 
agreement with that country. There are physical integration 
projects involving highways, port facilities, etc., that reveal 
the existence of a very good relationship between Chile and 
Bolivia at this moment. Let us hope it will lead to the 
establishment of diplomatic relations. 
  We maintain relations at a consular level with Cuba. We 
maintain commercial relations. Chilean businessmen are 
investing in Cuba and this must be considered when deciding to 
step up relations to an ambassadorial level, because a 
relationship does exist, as I have pointed out, at a consular 
level. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The Chilean Government has indicated that it is 
fully prepared to begin a "new era" of relations with Bolivia by 
evaluating positively Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada's most recent remarks about not tying any future step 
toward the resumption of diplomatic relations to the beginning 
of talks on Bolivia's lack of a sea outlet. 
  It has been explained, however, that the positive reaction 
of 
the Chilean Government does not imply that diplomatic relations 
will be resumed immediately. 
  Chilean politicians stated that Sanchez de Lozada's 
statement 
was "very positive" and praised the president's modern and 
daring approach. 
  Both government and political circles, however, agree that 
the remarks of the Bolivian president should be taken prudently 
bearing in mind that there are people in Bolivia whose position 
toward Chile and what they call "Bolivia's landlocked situation" 
is very hard and inflexible. [passage omitted] 
  Foreign Relations Under Secretary Rodrigo Diaz Albonico 
said: 
"We were very happy to hear what Bolivian President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada had to say." 
  Jorge Pizarro, speaker for the foreign relations committee 
of 
the Chamber of Deputies, believes that Sanchez de Lozada's 
remarks "are extraordinarily positive and reflect that the 
Bolivian president has a modern and daring approach to what 
relations between the states should be as far as the process of 
integration is concerned, in order to further the social and 
economic development of our peoples." 
  Experts in Bolivian-Chilean relations believe that rather 
than a change in Bolivia's foreign policy, there is a new and 
promising approach, confirmed by the fact the Sanchez de Lozada 
attended the Rio Group presidential summit in Santiago last year. 
  "After what Sanchez de Lozada said, it is assumed that this 
so-called `new approach' will lead Bolivia to begin talks aimed 
at reestablishing diplomatic relations in the not too distant 
future," the experts said. 
  Despite the remarks of the Bolivian president, the sources 
are not sure whether Bolivia's strategy is to resume relations 
and immediately tackle the sea outlet issue or to deal with both 
issues simultaneously. 
  Chile does not acknowledge any pending issues between the 
two 
countries on the grounds that there are treaties in effect, 
especially the 1904 treaty, which establish the current border 
between the two countries. Thus, Chile did not accept any 
conditions when the resumption of ties was proposed in the past. 
  The Foreign Ministry under secretary pointed out that the 
Bolivian president used the expression "new era" which is the 
same one Diaz Albonico used when he went to La Paz last year. 
The under secretary said that this was highly significant. 
  As to Bolivia's new willingness to approach the resumption 
of 
diplomatic ties without first tackling its so-called "landlocked 
situation," Albonico said that Sanchez de Lozada's words should 
be studied carefully. 
  He added, however, that the remarks of the Bolivian 
president 
augur a change in the political relations between the two 
countries, that may free them from past problems.

  [Excerpt] Official Investigative Police sources yesterday 
confirmed that two of the seven Lautaro Rebel and Popular Front 
(FRPL) militants arrested by Investigative Police intelligence 
agents occupy very important positions in the hierarchy of the 
terrorist organization. 
  They are alleged subversives Jose Luis Medina Soto and Omar 
Alejandro Hermosilla Marin, second and third in that terrorist 
hierarchy, respectively. It was reported that they, and the 
other group members, were preparing an "annihilation operation" 
against a bus of the 38th Carabineros Station in La Florida. 
  The individuals were captured on 23 February as a result of 
investigations launched by the police following the attack 
against the "New Spain" Carabineros premises in La Cisterna on 
21 February and a series of other actions, such as bombings of 
political party offices. These actions were considered a 
reaction to the transfer of 45 prisoners, who are in jail on 
charges of terrorist activities, to the new maximum security 
prison. 
  The other FRPL militants captured with the first two were 
identified as Alma Magaly Victoria Salame Inostroza, Oscar 
Antonio Cruces Espinoza, Sergio Manuel Gonzalez Gonzalez, Ulises 
Antonio Manriquez Rojas, and Doris Marianela Ojeda Cisterna. 
  It was also established that the group had direct links with 
Mapu-Lautaro [United Popular Action Movement-Lautaro] top leader 
Guillermo Ossandon Canas, alias "Diego Carvajal," who is still 
at large. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The Investigative Police have arrested the most 
wanted drug trafficker in the country. Selin Valenzuela 
Galdamez, 49, has been at large since 1992, when he was indicted 
by the Swedish courts on charges of having financed many drug 
shipments, including 40 kg of cocaine hidden in packages of 
dried grapes. 
  Two other Chileans were sentenced in Sweden for the same 
crime. The Chilean police reported that Valenzuela has been 
involved in drug trafficking since the 1970's, but that his 
arrest had not been possible because he was using a false name. 
  An Investigative Police officer said that Valenzuela is 
undoubtedly the most wanted drug trafficker in the country 
because of his link with international rings. 
  Valenzuela was arrested in the city of Villa Alemana on 
charges of fraud against many companies for over 70 million 
pesos, and not because of drug trafficking. [passage omitted] 
  The police also arrested two of Valenzuela's partners, 
identified as Ruben Calderon and Raul Oyarsun. The police 
reported that they were using their money to build a luxury inn 
in the Fifth Region.

  [Text] Santiago, 14 Mar (EFE) -- Chilean Navy Commander 
Admiral Jorge Martinez Busch confirmed today that the Navy is 
about to purchase some units to renew its materiel. 
  Admiral Martinez Busch said the Navy is always concerned 
about renewing "the old ships, those that are already obsolete." 
He indicated that the units to be purchased are large ones. 
  He declined to indicate what type of units, although he 
mentioned they will be very useful to cover the long Chilean 
geography. 
  According to EL MERCURIO, it has been learned that the units 
are two 8,000-metric ton ships for transporting the Marine 
infantry and its equipment. 
  Martinez Busch added: "We will be able to provide support 
for isolated areas with large quantities of materiel. The naval 
units are not only war units but support units for all Chileans." 
  Last week the Chilean Air Force announced the purchase from 
Belgium of 20 Mirages to replace the old Hawker Hunter.

  [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy will not be in 
Asuncion tomorrow, during the great march against the farm 
sector policy, which is being sponsored by peasant organizations. 
  Wasmosy, accompanied by Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez 
de 
Lozada, will visit the Itaipu hydroelectric dam at 0700 and 
visit Brazilian towns until the afternoon. 
  Peasant organization leaders say Wasmosy's attitude shows he 
has no vision of the real magnitude of the current conflict and 
that he lacks the political will to give structural solutions to 
the problem of land and the sale of cotton. 
  After visiting Itaipu, Sanchez de Lozada and Wasmosy will 
lunch in Foz de Iguazu and then visit the Brazilian city of Sao 
Paulo to dedicate a sluice in a hydroelectric power plant in 
Tiete River. For this reason he will not see the peasant protest.

  Chamber of Deputies President Francisco Jose de Vargas has 
said he is aware that some people have been hired to cause 
disturbances outside Congress during the peasant march.

  [Text] As part of the austerity program that the Executive 
Branch announced, a 15 percent spending cut has been approved 
for the Ministry of the Secretariat of the Presidency; this cut 
represents some 205 million bolivares. Presidency Minister 
Andres Caldera Pietri said that the austerity program began on 
inaugural day because the 50 million [currency not specified] 
earmarked for the inauguration were not spent. The objectives 
of this reorganization are to modernize and revamp the 
secretariat as an organization that will help the head of state 
do his work, to increase the efficiency of government 
expenditures, to fully utilize management control systems, and 
to restructure most functional areas. 
  After an arduous analysis, it was concluded that the best 
thing to do was to eliminate the Ministry of the Secretariat of 
the Presidency altogether and change it once more to the 
Secretariat General of the Presidency, as it used to be before 
the Public Administration Basic Law was reformed in 1976. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] We decided to decrease the fleet 
of 
vehicles serving the Presidency Secretariat by 50 percent, thus 
reducing insurance costs as well as expenses on spare parts, 
repairs, and so on. During the first month of the current 
administration the Presidency Secretariat decreased its fuel 
costs by 43.3 percent, per diem and travel expenses by 43.7 
percent, office equipment expenses by 46.3 percent, kitchen and 
butler service expenses by 26.8 percent, and newspaper and 
magazine expenses by 77 percent. In addition, the number of 
telephone lines with access to international and national long 
distance calls was decreased by 62 and 30 percent, respectively. 
These cuts will undoubtedly cause reductions in telephone bills. 
  The second part, which is essential to this reorganization, 
will consist of reassignments at 14 institutions that are under 
the Presidency Secretariat. They make the administration more 
burdensome, and their work is unrelated to that of the 
secretariat's. Some of these institutions will be reassigned to 
organizations whose activities are more related to the works of 
said institutions. This will be achieved by amending the law, 
as is the case with autonomous institutions, and by issuing 
presidential decrees in meetings with the Council of Ministers, 
as is the case with foundations. [end recording] 
  Minister Caldera announced that from now on, the Miraflores 
Bicentennial Square will be open to the public on Sundays. 
There will be entertainment for children in the mornings and 
concerts for adults in the afternoons.

<F P=106> [Report by Taynem Hernandez] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, Colombian Ambassador to Venezuela Alberto 
Casas Santamaria denied relations between the two countries 
would change after the Colombian presidential elections or as a 
result of President Rafael Caldera's policies. The diplomat, who 
participated in a news conference held by the 
Colombian-Venezuelan Integration Chamber to announce the 
Binational Investors Conference to be held next week in Caracas, 
said: "The candidates with the best changes have already said 
they will more or less continue the same policies towards 
Venezuela." 
  Colombian presidential elections will be held on 8 May, when 
the two leading candidates, Ernesto Samper, candidate of the 
ruling Liberal Party, and Andres Pastrana, candidate for the 
Conservative Party, will face each other. Meanwhile, 
parliamentary elections are scheduled for Sunday. 
  Casas Santamaria said his government is also confident 
President Caldera will not change Venezuelan policy towards his 
country, which the president and the finance and foreign 
ministers have also confirmed. In fact, the ambassador also 
announced the possibility of a binational ministers' meeting to 
discuss the border issue, which he called "the most complicated 
problem in relations between Venezuela and Colombia." 
  Concerning increased trade between the two countries, Casas 
Santamaria reaffirmed Colombia's pledge to continue the policies 
and norms that have encouraged a trade increase, and he appeared 
optimistic about the possibility that Colombian investments will 
increase significantly this year compared to 1992. In this 
regard, members of the Colombian-Venezuelan Integration Chamber 
estimated that $2 billion will be negotiated this year, which 
would represent a 25 percent increase compared to 1993, when 
$1.6 billion were negotiated. 
  According to business estimates, this increase will be 
attributable to an increase in oil services and construction 
trade. Regarding oil services, Colombia is planning an 
aggressive oil production program which will allow the 
possibility of investment by Venezuelan companies. Therefore, 
the investment possibilities in Colombia will diversify. 
Colombia received $63 million in Venezuelan capital during 1993, 
primarily used in financial and insurance areas, 
metal-mechanics, marketing, and the distribution of Venezuelan 
products in Colombia. Moreover, the Colombian industry injected 
almost $6 million in Venezuela's computer, lumber, and 
automobile sectors. 
  The main objective of the Colombian-Venezuelan Investors 
Conference will be to evaluate the results of two years of 
integration, as of this month, and to study new investment 
opportunities in the two countries, particularly joint ventures 
in some binational projects.

  [Text] The Justice and Peace Commission has publicly 
admonished the Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD] for 
committing proven acts of violence against members of the 
Christian Democratic Party [PDC] on 6 March in La Chorrera 
District. A Justice and Peace Commission statement pointed out 
that although it is encouraging that PRD leaders, as well as 
members who perpetrated the acts, made apologies and rejected 
violence, the Commission wishes to remind everyone that the 
ethical agreement that was signed seeks to avoid and prevent 
incidents of this type and reiterates to the signatories their 
responsibility to honor this agreement. The Justice and Peace 
Commission urged all political parties and all citizens to stop 
insults and attacks and to seek together the path leading to a 
consensus. 
  Meanwhile, the PRD issued a communique accepting and 
respecting the Justice and Peace Commission's admonishment. It 
also called on the PRD Court of Honor and Discipline to apply 
the corresponding disciplinary measures to those members 
responsible for the attack. The PRD again prompted all its 
members to honor the commitments that the party made in the 
Santa Maria La Antigua Ethical-Electoral Pact.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections 
scheduled for 8 May 1994. 
  During the Chiriqui province chapter of CADE [Annual 
Conference of Business Executives] '94, held at the Bambito 
Hotel, presidential candidate Ruben Dario Carles (for the 
National Renewal Movement, Nationalist Liberal Republican 
Movement, and Civic Renewal Party that comprise the Change '94 
alliance) announced that he wants to establish a commission to 
promote investments and jobs, "so that local and foreign 
investors will not be lost like someone in the woods who doesn't 
know where to go." Samuel Lewis Galindo, presidential candidate 
for the Solidarity Party and the National Unity Mission that 
comprise the National Consensus Alliance, promised he would 
lower taxes on agricultural supplies to lower production costs. 
"We would do this also by supporting and promoting the 
appropriate producer organizations by giving them training and 
orientation, as well as any technical and financial support they 
may need." Christian Democratic Party presidential candidate 
Eduardo Vallarino said: "Not being prepared for economic 
aperture means certain death for the small production that still 
exists in primary and secondary sectors." Ernesto Perez 
Balladares, presidential candidate for the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD), Labor Party, and the Liberal 
Republican Party that comprise the United People alliance, 
announced that he would create "irrigation provinces [provincias 
de riego]." "Another element would be the development of 
business organizations." The candidates concurred on the need 
to decentralize public administration to expedite the autonomous 
development of provinces, to protect national production, 
improve the country's road infrastructure to and from Bocas del 
Toro and Chiriqui, and upgrade ports on the Atlantic and Pacific 
coasts. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 
28 February 94) 
  Four presidential candidates -- Jose Salvador Munoz, of the 
Doctrinaire Panamenist Party; Eduardo Vallarino; Ernesto Perez 
Balladares, and Ruben Carles -- have said that the Panamanian 
Banking Center is solid and efficient, while acknowledging that 
it must undergo some reforms to consolidate its prestige at the 
national and international level. The candidates conveyed this 
position on 8 March at a meeting organized by the National 
Banking Association. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 9 March 
94 p 1A) 
  The Change '94 presidential slate presented unveiled its 
platform at a 3 March news conference. The plan "will promote 
the creation of more and better jobs in different sectors and 
improve the quality of current jobs, emphasizing different 
training and job education programs. It will maintain the 
13-month bonus and continue paying workers their second 
allotment of the 13-month bonus," Carles said. (Panama City 
Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 3 March 94) 
  A report detailing Carles' position on corruption 
highlighted 
the following points: As a result of the corruption that 
prevailed during the military dictatorship, the Panamanian state 
ended up "in the service of organized crime both inside and 
outside the country, particularly in drug trafficking and money 
laundering." Carles notes that this is why "the eradication of 
corruption will be a slow, difficult, and complex task, but a 
task that must be tackled." He added: "Public spending and the 
use of state property must be strictly and fiscally controlled." 
(Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 7 March 94 p 10A) 
  Papa Egoro Movement [MPE] presidential candidate Ruben 
Blades has said that now that the political campaign has gotten 
under way "the people will really have choices." In response 
to a reporter's question that his campaign seems to be 
faltering, Blades noted that his is a "new group, and we lack 
the economic means others have in the country's politics. Also 
our group has been organizing as we grow." (Panama City 
Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 2 March 94) 
  Ruben Blades has said that newsmen will not accompany him on 
his campaign visits because they work for news media "controlled 
by" political and economic "interests." (Panama City LA PRENSA 
in Spanish 7 March 94 p2) 
  Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, presidential candidate for the 
Arnulfist Party, Authentic Liberal Party, Liberal Party, and the 
Independent Democratic Union that comprise the Democratic 
Alliance, has said that in line with her party's principles, she 
will not participate in public debates. She also indicated it 
is too late now to set up runoffs. (Panama City Circuito RPC 
Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 3 March 94) 
  On 8 March, Gruber came out in favor of a new law on the 
banking system that would check money laundering. Regarding the 
U.S. military bases in Panama, she noted that it is the people 
of Panama who, through a plebiscite, must decide whether the 
bases should stay or go. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in 
Spanish 9 March 94 p 1A) 
  The Arnulfist Party announced at a news conference that it 
is 
ready for the 8 May elections. The party already has more than 
10,000 party members to represent the party at voting tables 
throughout the country. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in 
Spanish 2300 GMT 7 March 94) 
  Galindo has unveiled a plan to decentralize the executive 
branch, giving ministries and autonomous and semiautonomous 
entities the authority to implement their own plans and 
projects. His plan calls for the creation of public security, 
tourism, transportation, communications, environment, and 
finance ministries, as well as a national secretariat attached 
to the Presidency. "We will get nowhere so long as we continue 
to not have a modern and agile government that facilitates 
investment by local and foreign citizens." (Panama City 
Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 28 February 94) 
  The National Consensus Alliance candidate has proposed the 
creation of a deputy minister's office to handle drug 
prevention, penalties, and rehabilitation. Galindo said that 
ethics standards in Panamanian banking must be reviewed "to see 
if they should be expanded or if the government may take direct 
legal action to prevent" money laundering. (Panama City 
Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 3 March 94) 
  Perez Balladares has reaffirmed the Torrijist doctrine 
during 
a visit Las Palmas District, Veraguas Province. In the company 
of local leaders, the candidate listened to peasants, farmers, 
and Indian representatives discuss their problems. (Panama City 
Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 28 February 94) 
  The United People alliance candidate has said that 
Panamanian 
society "faces an economic and moral crisis" that seriously 
threatens peaceful coexistence. This situation is all the more 
dramatic because in six years the country will assume control 
over the Panama Canal, Perez added. He also decried the 
government's failure to ease the problems of poverty and 
unemployment. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 7 March 
94 p 10a) 
  Perez Balladares has said that the PRD's government platform 
is gaining increasing acceptance among the Panamanian people. 
Polls continue to show him leading in voter approval ratings.

  [Text] Quito, 11 Mar (DPA) -- Replying to Peruvian 
President Alberto Fujimori's remarks of 10 March, President 
Sixto Duran-Ballen reiterated today Ecuador's willingness for 
dialogue and cooperation with Peru as a mechanism to resolve 
"pending territorial issues." Commenting on Fujimori's remark in 
Santiago, Chile, saying "the territorial issue between the two 
countries is a settled matter," Duran-Ballen said: "There are 
two viewpoints on the territorial issue between Ecuador and 
Peru." 
  According to a communique released in Quito today, 
Duran-Ballen said: "Dialogue can help us attain the greatest 
possible rapprochement and understanding between the respective 
positions of both countries." The Ecuadoran president is in 
Santiago to attend Chilean President-elect Eduardo Frei's 
swearing-in ceremony. 
  Peru says the territorial disputes between the two countries 
were settled through the Rio de Janeiro Protocol, but Ecuador 
questions the protocol's validity due to the special 
circumstances under which it was signed in January 1942 and 
because the protocol is nonexecutable as the result of its 
inherent geographical errors. 
  Duran-Ballen and Fujimori were scheduled to meet in Lima by 
late 1993, but an alleged disagreement on the agenda prevented 
setting the date for Duran-Ballen's trip, which is still pending 
and which would be the first one to be made by an Ecuadoran 
president to Peru in the two countries' nearly two centuries of 
independent existence.

  [Text] Legislators from diverse political parties have 
questioned the position of Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori 
who denied there was a border problem between Peru and Ecuador. 
Fujimori, who attended the presidential inauguration in Chile, 
stressed that the Rio de Janeiro Protocol is an international 
treaty and therefore ironclad. The parliamentarians said 
Ecuador does have a border problem, therefore, it should insist 
on finding a sovereign and graceful outlet to the Amazon. The 
Rio de Janeiro Protocol which benefits Peru should be annulled. 
  The statements by President Fujimori in Chile on the Rio de 
Janeiro Protocol have caused uneasiness in Ecuadoran political 
circles. Deputy Carlos Vallejo said it was advisable for the 
Executive Branch to continue handling the matter through the 
Foreign Ministry. 
  [Begin Vallejo recording] As I have always said, this is an 
issue we must let the Executive Branch handle through the 
Foreign Ministry. This branch is the representative that must 
deal with international matters and our problem with Peru. [end 
recording] 
  Nevertheless, for Independent Deputy [name indistinct] the 
problem of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol is a political problem 
used during election time. 
  [Begin independent deputy recording] Of course, Peru will 
never accept the existence of a border problem. If we were in 
their shoes we would not accept the existence of a border 
problem either. When I was a young boy we absolutely thought 
that the only way for us to recover our territory was by force, 
that the Peruvian people were spineless, and that we had enough 
force, interest, and courage to occupy that territory. It has 
been handled politically for the past 50 plus that the Rio de 
Janeiro Protocol has existed. It is time to be honest. Let us 
stop handling this politically and much less during preelection 
time. We must put our hands on our hearts, think honestly and 
rationally and realize that the only way to have our outlet to 
the Amazon is by the diplomatic road. We must bring about that 
the Peruvian Foreign Ministry, the Peruvian Government, and the 
Peruvian people -- brothers as they now feel of the Ecuadorans 
-- grant us the renewal of that right we have; that is to 
navigate along the Amazon River. [end recording] 
  Fujimori reiterated in Chile that the Rio de Janeiro 
Protocol 
is completely valid. These statements prompted several 
political sectors to say there is no reason for our President 
Sixto Duran-Ballen to travel to that nation. Other deputies 
also expressed their points of view on this issue. Democratic 
Left Deputy Antonio Rodriguez said that the Ecuadoran Government 
should ratify that the Rio de Janeiro Protocol signed in 1942 is 
null. Our position, he said, should be unyielding in upholding 
that the Rio de Janeiro Protocol is null and that there is a 
territorial conflict that in no way seeks an armed solution. 
Rather, it wants to draw attention to holding a permanent 
dialogue. 
  Meanwhile Republican Deputy Abraham Romero indicated that 
Peru's position that no border problem exists, is not in keeping 
with reality. The thesis that there is a problem cannot be 
wiped out, he said. A solution must be found promoting 
dialogue, he noted. Former Congress President Carlos Vallejo 
also said it was unacceptable for the Peruvian president to 
ignore the fact that there is a border problem. They themselves 
have sought -- through the protocol's guarantors -- a solution 
to the crisis, he noted. Carlos Vallejo also said that the two 
communities should reach an honorable agreement that will allow 
the two nations to act with dignity without giving up the rights 
over the Amazon River.

  Approximately 70 companies and capital enterprises from the

  [Text] The much heralded Second National Congress of the 
Communist Party-Shining Path, which was announced for March with 
government cooperation, is being frustrated by discrepancies 
between imprisoned Shining Path militants over Abimael Guzman's 
peace negotiations. This change of mind was visible 15 days ago 
at the Canto Grande Prison when a group of inmates started to 
shout "Viva the armed struggle and the Gonzalo [Abimael Guzman] 
Thought," instead of singing the national anthem, which was 
apparently something they had agreed to do. This disagreement 
in the negotiating line seems to have been started by Victor 
Catano, an important military commander imprisoned in Yanamayo, 
and none other than Maritza Garrido Lecca, another inmate. It 
was then that the imprisoned Shining Path leaders began to 
demand a Second Congress to discuss the bases for negotiating 
with the government. Faced with these revelations and 
discouraged by Guzman's confession that the peace process would 
only be a "strategic and momentary withdrawal" (LA REPUBLICA 25 
Jan 94), President Alberto Fujimori changed his mind and now 
says the event obviously cannot be carried out without his 
consent.

  [Text] Lima, 13 Mar (EFE) -- It was announced today, 13 
March, that Counterterrorism Directorate [Dincote] personnel 
dismantled a Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) 
communications center in Trujillo, 570 km north of Lima. 
  Citing sources close to Dincote, the Lima press reports that 
Dincote troops have seized powerful radio transmitters and 
modern communications equipment used by MRTA leaders in Trujillo 
to communicate with their subordinates in the tropical forest 
region of Upper Huallaga. 
  This operation, which took place some days ago and 
culminated 
with the raid on the center, is another harsh blow to the MRTA. 
The terrorist group received yet another setback this past week 
in the same northern city -- the capital of La Libertad 
Department -- when six MRTA leaders, including an Italian woman, 
were arrested. 
  The sources state that the communications center was 
frequently visited by Nestor Serpa Cartolini, alias "Evaristo," 
the current top MRTA leader following the arrest of Victor Polay 
in May 1992. 
  Serpa apparently just missed being captured -- he was at the 
communications center just before the operation was mounted. No 
arrests were made during the raid. 
  The Dincote report states that one of the two vehicles 
seized 
when the six MRTA members were caught belongs to Serpa. 
  Lima EL COMERCIO today reports that the Italian citizen -- a 
member of the MRTA who lived with a terrorist called "Perseo" -- 
has been identified as Maria Gabriela Geronino or Gabriela 
Guarino, allegedly a journalist. 
  In another operation, four Shining Path members were 
captured 
in the Province of Cajabamba, in the northern department of 
Cajamarca. 
  The sources report that the MRTA has been practically mopped 
up, although there are still some scattered pockets that Serpa 
is trying to reorganize.

  [Text] Lima, 14 Mar (EFE) -- At least six individuals -- 
five terrorists and one civilian -- have died in Peru in the 
past few hours. Meanwhile, a terrorist offensive hit Lima with 
various fires and two bomb attacks. 
  Five terrorists died during a confrontation with the Army at 
a jungle town in Tarma Province, Peru's central region, at 
midnight on 12 March. 
  An Army spokesman said the clash occurred when a column of 
25 
subversives tried to take over the town of Culebron but was 
repelled by a military detachment based in the area. 
  One woman died when a bomb exploded in front of a 
high-ranking Navy officer's residence in Lima's San Isidro 
District. The bomb destroyed the building's front and damaged 
the house of journalist and former Education Minister Patricio 
Rickets. 
  Police said four individuals were wounded during the attack, 
adding that one person is in serious condition. 
  The terrorist also set afire two supermarkets, a shopping 
center, and a large store located in the residential districts 
of Jesus Maria, Miraflores, San Borja, and San Isidro. 
  In order to carry out their attacks the terrorists entered 
the shops during working hours and "sowed" fire bombs with 
timing devices inside the buildings. According to police, the 
bombs exploded almost simultaneously the night of 13 March. 
  The most spectacular fire occurred at the SAGA [local 
department store chain that serves as a representative for Sears 
products] shop's main offices in San Isidro, where a military 
force that guards Lima's financial center is based. 
  The fire, however, only affected the shop's second floor. 
The 
shop owners said the center will reopen this week. 
  The most spectacular bomb attack occurred in Santa Clara, on 
the outskirts of Lima, where terrorists detonated a car bomb 
that destroyed the local police station's coffee shop and left 
many people slightly injured. 
  The explosion also affected some 20 houses and a medical 
center near the police station. 
  Police think the extremist group Red Path [Sendero Rojo], a 
Shining Path dissident group, is responsible for the attacks. 
The Red Path rejects peace talks between the imprisoned Shining 
Path leadership and the government. 
  The dissident Maoists prefer incendiary attacks because the 
risk to them is minimal, a police spokesman said. 
  The Red Path claimed responsibility for two other incendiary 
attacks last month. One of the attacks was against the 
Army-owned "Metro" supermarket, and the other was against the El 
Callao naval base where Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman is 
serving his life sentence. 
  The same group also claimed responsibility for a car bomb 
that seriously damaged the Air Force General Barracks on 8 
February.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on insurgent activities in Peru compiled from Peruvian 
papers monitored through 3 March. 
  On 24 February the National Police presented to the press 23 
Shining Path "terrorists" who operated in several provinces of 
Ancash Department. They had perpetrated nearly 50 attacks and 
selective crimes against civilian authorities over the past few 
months. They were arrested after a thorough investigation 
conducted over six months by authorities in the many shantytowns 
of Callejon de Huaylas and Conchucos, and in the Lima provinces 
of Huaura and Barranca. The forces seized a large amount of 
explosives, weapons, subversive propaganda, and maps of various 
public buildings used in attacking civilian authorities in 
Chavin Region. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 25 Feb 94 p A14) 
  Lambayeque Superior Court ``faceless'' judges cleared 
physician Victor Echeandia Arellano, lawyer Victor Ciguena 
Campos, and six teachers of the charge of terrorism after they 
had served 14 months in prison. They had been "erroneously 
accused of involvement in terrorist activities." (Lima EXPRESO 
in Spanish 25 Feb 94 p A14) 
  Army personnel have arrested four Tupac Amaru Revolutionary 
Movement members operating in Paucartambo valley and Chanchamayo 
Province, Junin Department. They were identified as Juan Quispe 
Rojas, 28; Celestino Llantoy Duran, 27; Cesar Boza Ccoya, 24; 
and Victor Pardo Vivanco, 24. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 26 
Feb 94 p A14) 
  On 2 March 30 Shining Path "terrorists" surrendered to the 
military authorities at the Tingo Maria countersubversive base. 
Commander Juan Rivas said that 60 "terrorists" had surrendered 
under the repentance law over the past 72 hours, and that 1,100 
"terrorists," most of them members of the Shining Path 
organization, had surrendered in the first quarter of 1994. 
Among the repentants had been "top leaders" in the subversive 
organization in Upper Huallaga, according to Rivas. (Lima LA 
REPUBLICA in Spanish 3 Mar 94 pp 16-17)

  [Text] Lima, 14 Mar (EFE) -- The Lima newspaper LA 
REPUBLICA reported today that the Peruvian Army has denounced a 
smear campaign using all "national and international media in an 
improper exercise of freedom of the press." 
  According to a document sent to this newspaper entitled 
"Disloyalty, Immorality, and Corruption Do Not Exist in the 
Peruvian Army," the military said the institution is being 
presented "as a systematic violator of human rights, in 
collusion with drug trafficking gangs, and as an institution 
with internal problems." 
  The military also says 1994 "will be a very difficult year 
from a social and political point of view because it is a 
pre-electoral year. We cannot rule out the possibility that the 
propaganda campaign to smear the Army will intensify even more 
starting in the second half of 1994," the document says. 
  The latest issue of the weekly magazine SI that hit the 
stands today denounces that the political military command in 
Northern Huallaga Valley in 1992 "ordered an operation to cover 
up the activities of drug traffickers that resulted in the death 
of eight civilians and a complicated trial in military courts." 
  The publication says that on 29 October 1992 a military 
patrol intercepted eight individuals, two of them Colombians, 
transporting 150 kg of cocaine paste. According to SI, the drug 
traffickers offered $30,000 to pass. However, the next day the 
eight individuals were found dead and the drugs had disappeared. 
  The magazine says the case was later presented as an 
anti-subversive operation or a settling of accounts between drug 
traffickers and terrorists. Military justice is looking into the 
matter.

<F P=106> [Article by Roger Rumrrill] </F>
  [Text] Judging by results, there is no reason whatsoever -- 
no economic, political, or social argument -- for continuing the 
antidrug policy implemented in October 1990 as part of the 
so-called "Fujimori Doctrine." 
  Except for the official definition that coca growers are 
farmers who work within the informal sector -- an expression 
coined by General Alberto Arciniega Huby in 1989 and 
subsequently taken up by Hernando de Soto [chairman of the 
Freedom and Democracy Institute] when he classified these 
peasants as valid interlocutors -- the balance of the struggle 
against drug trafficking is lamentable. If there were 5,000 
hectares of coca plantations in the Huallaga Valley back in 1970 
when the cycle started, there are now 300,000 hectares in the 
departments of the Amazon region -- Loreto, San Martin, Madre de 
Dios, and Ucayali. 
  Thus, one of the main objectives of the drug enforcement 
policy -- namely, the reduction of coca plantations -- has not 
been attained, nor has the goal to control and check the export 
of drugs. Official sources show that only 9,461.43 kilograms of 
drugs were seized in 1993. These 9 metric tons represent less 
than 1 percent of all drugs processed in Peru. 
  The control of money laundering, the clean-up of drug 
kingpins -- the cartel leaders -- and the war against corruption 
throughout the government and society, leaves much to be 
desired. The "Vaticano" case has laid bare a Peruvian society 
racked by corruption. 
  Explaining the reasons behind the change in the U.S. drug 
enforcement policy -- which now emphasizes better control on 
demand, the rehabilitation of addicts, education, and prevention 
-- President Clinton pointed out that the six-year "War on 
Drugs" has cost the American people $56 billion and produced 
hardly any results because the same or other drugs enter the 
United States and the number of users continues to increase 
proportionally. Hence the change in outlook and approach. 
  Given the fact that the Clinton administration has adopted 
an 
inward-looking policy, why should we -- the Andean countries -- 
adopt an outward-looking policy? In other words, why should we 
embark on a crop-substitution policy like the one they just 
dropped because of its failure? 
  I believe the centerpiece of a new drug policy in Peru -- 
which should be part of a comprehensive development policy for 
the Amazon region -- must include economic and social 
considerations. On the one hand, it should ensure that tropical 
valley producers -- where coca and poppies are farmed -- recover 
their productive capacity, which was nearly destroyed by an 
overly free trade policy (flexible surtaxes are not enough to 
check unfair and abusive competition by foreign countries) and 
by the closure of the Agrarian Bank; that is, via a system of 
credits for the agricultural sector. 
  Only 10 percent of credit requirements in the Amazon region 
are at present met by Fondeagros [expansion unknown] and other 
mechanisms. The situation in the rest of the country is most 
probably the same. 
  On the other hand, the organization of agricultural 
producers 
into agro-businesses should be given top priority in the social 
area. The entrenched shortcomings of the present marketing 
mechanisms (calling it a system is out of the question) rob 
agricultural producers of nearly 40 percent of their returns or 
earnings. Given this state of affairs, it is impossible to talk 
about streamlining agriculture through the incorporation of 
leading-edge technology geared to stepping up production, to 
diversifying crops, and to promoting agro-industries. 
Modernizing Peruvian agriculture first requires the elimination 
of the middlemen -- who many times are totally unnecessary -- so 
that producers may recover that 40 percent. 
  The establishment of new agro-businesses is of the utmost 
importance to achieve two immediate ends in the new drug policy: 
To negotiate with the European Union, the United States, and 
Japan the sale of our tropical products, and to enable these 
organizations to create a new sustainable productive pattern in 
the Amazon region through the development of administration 
projects and the sensible use of tropical biodiversity. 
  While the first priority for the United States is now to 
combat drug use, for Peru it is to combat production. This 
should not be a military fight; it should be economic, social, 
and political. 
  I believe it is time the struggle against drug trafficking 
in 
Peru was demilitarized. There are several reasons for this: The 
ability of drug trafficking to corrupt others is immense, and 
the militarization of drug enforcement has failed. The results 
of this are there for everybody to see and the role of the 
military is relegated to other spheres within the new strategy. 
  The argument for militarizing the struggle against 
trafficking through the Internal Operations Front Command (Cofi) 
may have something to do with the relationship between political 
subversion and drug trafficking. But this argument is no longer 
valid in 1994. 
  This change in approach and new strategy should lead to a 
change in Peru's antinarcotics legislation, commencing with Act 
No. 22095 enacted in 1978 during Moralez Bermudez's 
administration, as it is interdictory legislation against coca 
from a doctrinal standpoint. 
  As a government campaign to enhance the value of coca -- 
implemented through the Enaco [National Coca Enterprise] -- the 
Foreign Ministry and the peasants should be the hub of this new 
campaign. We have unfortunately lost a precious ally in this 
field, Bolivia, which embarked on the impossible mission of 
eradicating coca crops in an operation whose results will surely 
be reflected in its name -- the Zero Option. Of course it is 
necessary to create the necessary mechanisms and civilian 
institutions to make this new drug policy feasible one in our 
country. Control mechanisms should, at the same time, be 
enhanced. Three Tucano planes flying off into the immensity of 
the Amazon skies are like three swallows not making a summer.

  [Text] A study by the company Imasen [Image and Market 
Sociology] released today shows that former UN Secretary General 
Javier Perez de Cuellar leads voters' preferences for president 
of the Republic by 45.2 percent to 43.4 percent, which 
represents support for President Alberto Fujimori. 
  The survey refers to figures obtained during the first week 
in March and recalls that last January, Perez de Cuellar and 
Fujimori were tied with 43.1 percent each. 
  The survey was conducted after the sale of Telefonica 
Peruana 
and Entel Peru [National Telecommunications Enterprise of Peru] 
to Telefonica de Espana for a total of $2.002 billion, which was 
considered an economic success for Fujimori's government. 
  It must be noted that Perez de Cuellar has been reluctant to 
accept his possible candidacy for the presidency despite Imasen 
results showing that he has more than 45 percent support. 
  The same survey shows that if Fujimori runs against Lima 
Mayor Ricardo Belmont he would obtain 49.6 percent of the votes 
against 31.3 percent for Belmont, who obtained 1.3 percent more 
than in a previous survey. 
  Legislators Fernando Olivera and Enrique Chirinos have said 
that if Fujimori runs for reelection, as authorized by the 1993 
Constitution, he must resign his post six months before, 
according to Olivera, and four months before, according to 
Chirinos.

<F P=106> ["Highlights" of interview with Conrado Seminario, executive </F>
director of the Peruvian Institute of Nuclear Energy, IPEN, by 
Iris Alegria C.; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Alegria] Dr. Seminario, what are the main projects 
being developed by IPEN? 
  [Seminario] Our institute is doing two kinds of 
investigations. First, we have the projects for the development 
of applied technologies, which provide for various techniques 
for testing several materials. These investigations are being 
made at the Nuclear Research Center of Peru. 
  [Alegria] How are those projects financed? 
  [Seminario] Financing comes from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), while IPEN professionals participate in 
the development of projects. The duration of the projects is 
generally two to three years. 
  [Alegria] What are the applications of that research? 
  [Seminario] It is very important to emphasize that the work 
has biomedical, agricultural, and industrial uses. The results 
provide techniques that can be used by economic agents in 
general, and are a clear example of the transfer of technology. 
  [Alegria] What other type of research is IPEN doing? 
  [Seminario] There are other projects, with various 
objectives. Among them is the project for food irradiation 
technology, in which we are receiving international technical 
cooperation. 
  [Alegria] Is IAEA cooperating in this project? 
  [Seminario] Right. IAEA has provided the equipment, which 
consists of a source of cobalt 60 (a material that emits gamma 
radiation) and the electromechanical part. The equipment, worth 
$1.5 million, is about to arrive in Peru. 
  [Alegria] When will project operations start? 
  [Seminario] We are now building a special facility -- 60 
percent of the construction has already been completed -- that 
is necessary for the installation of the equipment. We estimate 
that construction will end in four months. 
  [Alegria] And when will the plant begin operating? 
  [Seminario] By the end of the year, because installation of 
the equipment will take four months. Russian technicians will 
come for this purpose. It will then be possible to use gamma 
rays for food preservation. 
  [Alegria] What will be the specific applications of the 
project? 
  [Seminario] The plant will have two main uses. First, it 
will serve to extend the shelf life of food by inhibiting 
deterioration (thus permitting transportation and exportation of 
food). On the other hand, it will be used for the 
decontamination of vegetables (eliminating microorganisms, 
fungi, and bacteria). 
  I want to emphasize that this plant will also serve to 
exhibit the technology of the field and prove the profitability 
of nuclear activities. There are many privately owned plants 
like this around the world. 
  [Alegria] What will be the main economic repercussions of 
this project? 
  [Seminario] This technology will permit major progress in 
the 
manipulation of food, and this will expand the supply of 
exportable farm products. 
  This technique has actually been used, at a laboratory 
level, 
for the past four years. Unfortunately, the scale at which we 
can operate is limited because of the small size of our 
equipment. 
  [Alegria] What specific work has been done? 
  [Seminario] For example, decontamination of carmine dye for 
export. As you know, this product is obtained from an insect 
(cochineal), which is found in tuna. The insect has some 
"natural" contamination that has to be eliminated in order to 
access international markets. 
  We have also treated lucuma [local Peruvian tree] flour, 
cacao, and even murex capsules. 
  [Alegria] That is, relations with the private sector have 
already been established... 
  [Seminario] Right, and they are quite good. Our facilities 
are also used by the chemical and pharmaceutical industries for 
the preservation of raw materials (which are very sensitive), 
and for the sterilization of products for surgical use. 
  Nuclear sterilization (or radio sterilization) has great 
potential, because this method is more advantageous than the 
others. There are currently more than 150 nuclear plants 
providing this service throughout the world. 
  [Alegria] Is irradiation for preserving food also widely 
accepted? 
  [Seminario] Of course. In 1983 a special committee 
consisting of FAO, WHO, and IAEA specialists recommended this 
for the preservation of food. From that time on, every country 
has been studying specific cases to establish its own dosages. 
  [Alegria] IPEN recently signed several agreements with 
Concytec [National Science and Technology Council]. Are any of 
the agreements related to food preservation? 
  [Seminario] Yes. We believe this technology can provide 
concrete solutions to the country's food problem. The current 
loss of harvested food is over 30 percent, and this percentage 
could be reduced by nuclear irradiation. 
  We should understand that it is more difficult to create new 
agricultural zones than to prevent part of the harvested food 
from being lost. We are talking about practical solutions. For 
example, in the case of fish, the irradiation technology can be 
applied as a complement to other conservation techniques to ease 
transportation. 
  [Alegria] What will the agreement with Concytec consist of? 
  [Seminario] It will serve to complete the laboratory 
equipment, and to carry out the research, development, and 
dissemination of the project. 
  [Alegria] What is the professional level of the people 
working in the IPEN? 
  [Seminario] Two training programs have been carried out 
since 
the institution was created. The first was carried out in this 
country, and the second involved a training period in Argentina. 
  We had a full staff in 1988, and from that time the training 
has been constant. We have given master's degree courses at 
Peruvian universities. Agreements have been signed with the 
Engineering and San Marcos Universities for the implementation 
of postgraduate courses in nuclear engineering and nuclear 
chemistry. 
  In sum, I can say that our capability and experience put us 
in a good position within the Latin American context. 
  [Alegria] What is the importance of science and technology 
at 
the international level? 
  [Seminario] Very important. The UN Development Program 
(UNDP) has adopted the issue of scientific and technological 
progress and the modernization of the productive sector as one 
of the priority issues for the 1992-1996 period. 
  This issue was adopted as a result of concerted action by 
Latin American countries, which have recognized the urgent need 
to develop their own science and technology, to increase 
production and competition and to reach the levels of the 
developed countries. 
  [Alegria] Finally, what are the prospects for the use of 
nuclear energy in industry? 
  [Seminario] Since nuclear fission was discovered 50 years 
ago, the application to industry of the energy liberated by this 
process is so large that there is no area of the technological 
field that has not been experimented with. Its application has 
therefore benefited man at the industrial level.

  [Text] In a news conference that was called following the 
publication of a news article in EL TIEMPO yesterday, Cuban 
Ambassador Jesus Martinez Beaton said that "it is not true that 
the Simon Bolivar National Guerrilla Coordinating Board 
participated in a guerrilla summit in Havana" or that the Cuban 
Government has set up an office for the Colombian guerrillas in 
the Cuban capital. 
  The diplomat repeatedly said that reports on the alleged 
office are "pure fantasy, speculation." He confirmed that the 
summit mentioned by EL TIEMPO was the Fourth Latin American and 
Caribbean Meeting of Solidarity, Sovereignty, 
Self-Determination, and the Life of Our Peoples, which was 
convened by the government and which was held in Havana between 
2 and 28 January 1994. 
  He said 25 Colombian delegates attended the event, of which 
previous editions were held in Quito (Ecuador), Santa Fe de 
Bogota, and Sao Paulo (Brazil). Some of them were: Guillermo 
Munoz from the AD/M-19 [19 April Movement Democratic Alliance]; 
Beatriz Zuloaga from Patriotic Union; Jaime Cedano and Miguel 
Gonzalez from the Communist Party of Colombia; and Manuel 
Rodriguez Garcia, labor union leaders from Telecom [Colombian 
Telecommunications Enterprise]. 
  According to the list released by Ambassador Martinez 
Beaton, 
others who attended the event were: Alberto Rivera, Alejandro 
Motato, Ana Maria de Villate, Antonio Jose Villate, Antonio 
Morro, Fidel Castro, Francisco Carbajal, Isabel de Guevara, 
Jairo Guerrero, Jorge Ortega, Luis A. Garcia, Luis Eduardo 
Vargas, Luz Ramirez, Nohora Espinal, Oscar Garcia, Rafael 
Espinosa, Rafael Ivan Forero, Fierbo (sic) Tulio Casas, Teddy 
Reyes, and Victor Manuel Bautista. The diplomat said all of them 
are persons linked to labor unions as well as social and peasant 
organizations that operate in Colombia. 
  "It is totally false that it was a meeting of guerrilla 
representatives; this is an event that is not secret and that is 
why our embassy processed the visas normally," he said. He said 
Cuba is not currently involved with Colombian guerrilla groups 
because "we have honest and sincere plans to achieve maximum 
relations with Colombia, and it is not our policy to interfere 
in the domestic affairs of other countries." 
  Ambassador Martinez said these persons arranged their trip 
through travel agencies, but admitted not knowing if there is a 
Colombian bishop among those mentioned on the list because "we 
do not investigate each person." He said he does not believe 
persons other than the ones mentioned on the list traveled to 
Cuba without the Cuban Embassy's knowledge because his 
government has very strict security and control measures to 
determine who participated in the event. The diplomat insisted 
that "no meeting by Colombian guerrilla representatives was held 
in Havana; there was no church participation nor any attempt to 
discuss the internal situation of Colombia in the framework of 
the event or outside the event." 
  Finally he pointed out that his immediate reaction to the 
report was due to the fact that "we have excellent relations 
with the Colombian Government and what appears to us is that 
there may be attempts to spoil this harmonious relation."

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 11 Mar (EFE) -- The Colombian 
Catholic Church has not sent bishops to meetings with guerrillas 
in Cuba, said Pedro Rubiano Saenz, president of the Colombian 
Episcopal Conference, today. 
  Rubiano, Cali archbishop, told Radio Cadena Nacional (RCN) 
the local media which had published information on the bishops' 
attendance to a "summit" with Colombian rebels in Havana should 
give the names of the alleged participants. 
  The priest categorically denied Nel Beltran, bishop of 
Sincelejo (northwest Colombia) and mediator between the 
government and rebels, had traveled to Cuba, as reported by the 
Santa Fe de Bogota media. 
  The worst thing that can happen to the nation during this 
election period is not to say the truth, said the president of 
the Episcopal Conference when referring to the conflict caused 
by the bishops' participation in talks with rebels. 
  Rubiano Saenz added "there must be an intention behind the 
news that are given in that manner, with half truths, as they 
remain up in the air." 
  Several Santa Fe de Bogota dailies and newspapers published 
on 8 March photographs of Luis Madrid Merlano, bishop of the 
Tibu petroleum area (northwest), meeting with guerrillas in the 
mountains. The priest explained these were "pastoral dialogues" 
seeking peace in his region.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota -- Government Minister Fabio 
Villegas Ramirez said today that Colombia will not suspend 
diplomatic relations with Cuba over an alleged meeting of 
guerrilla leaders that never took place. There was no such 
meeting, and the government does not expect any break in 
relations, the minister told the Caracol network in reference to 
a report published by the newspaper EL TIEMPO. 
  President Cesar Gaviria de-emphasized the issue and said 
there is no evidence of a guerrilla summit in Havana. 
  Minister Villegas also commented on the implementation of 
security operations during the elections, saying that they are 
going smoothly without major problems despite certain incidents.

  [Excerpt] While hundreds of Cuban exiles gathered in Miami 
in front of the Colombian Consulate to protest the sale of oil 
to Fidel Castro's regime, the government of President Gaviria 
was bolstering its trade relations with the dictator by signing 
several farm and fishery cooperation agreements. 
  Yesterday, the Agriculture Ministry announced that in 
addition to petroleum Colombia will sell rice and African palm 
oil to Cuba within the framework of new negotiations. Later, 
Colombia will also export other products, including pork, 
chicken, and grain. In exchange, Colombia will receive 
technological and scientific advice for the agricultural and 
fishing sectors. 
  To strengthen relations with the Castro regime, Deputy 
Agriculture Minister Santiago Perry Rubio; Jose Ernesto Macias, 
the ministry's marketing director; and several officials from 
the Colombian Corporation for Agricultural Research [Corporacion 
Colombiana de Investigacion Agropecuaria], the Veterinarian 
Products Enterprise [Empresa de Productos Veterinarios], the 
National Fisheries and Agricultural Institute [Instituto 
Nacional de Pesca y Agricultura], and the Colombian 
Agricultural-Livestock Institute met with Cuban Agriculture 
Minister Alfredo Jordan Morales and Cuba's vice ministers of 
agriculture -- Daniel Fajardo Cubelo and Abilio Cardenas Garcia. 
  The main types of cooperation agreed upon by the two 
delegations include Cuba's designing, building, and starting 
operations at a pilot fermentation plant to produce means of 
biological control [medios de control biologicos]; setting up a 
joint project to obtain banana varieties resistant to black 
sigatoka; and holding negotiations on ways to produce rice and 
palm oil on the island. 
  Also, Colombia agreed to cooperate in developing solar 
energy 
and wind power in Cuba and to give advice in the field of 
veterinarian medicine. Colombian Agriculture Minister Jose 
Antonio Ocampo will soon meet with his Cuban counterpart Alfredo 
Jordan Morales in Havana to ratify these agreements. [passage

<F P=106> ["Text" of letter sent by the People's Militia from Ciudad </F>
Bolivar in Santa Fe de Bogota to Government and Interior 
Minister Fabio Villegas; date not given] 
  [Text] As militiamen of Ciudad Bolivar, being aware of the 
country's need to test peace formulas to finally overcome the 
ghost of violence and riding on the current climate that favors 
political and social detente, we propose a new peace process 
with the various protagonists of a warlike confrontation, whose 
stage is the biggest belt of abject poverty in Latin America. 
  We are a handful of men and women who, by taking up arms, 
found an answer to the oblivion into which the state plunged us, 
to the daily hunger, and to the lack of public services to 
reaffirm our condition as decent human beings. On other 
occasions, we resorted to arms in self-defense of the criminal 
behavior of police authorities who are killing the future of 
Ciudad Bolivar: its youth. 
  We believe that now is a propitious moment to stop, pause 
for 
the sake of coexistence to find different ways to face despair 
and anguish; we urge communities to join efforts and the 
national and district governments to adopt a new attitude to 
rescue this vast zone known as Ciudad Bolivar. 
  For us, peace negotiations at this location only make sense 
insofar as they bring about social investments by the state to 
settle the social and human debt that Colombia and Santa Fe de 
Bogota owe to Ciudad Bolivar.

  [Text] Amid the controversy stirred up by the news about 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff meeting with three alleged 
drug traffickers from the so-called Cali Cartel, another 
confusing episode involving that organization was revealed last 
week by the news program "Noticiero QAP" and the newspaper EL 
ESPECTADOR. 
  According to those news sources, the Prosecutor General's 
Office served as a middleman to facilitate peace talks between 
the Cali Cartel and what is left of the Medellin Cartel, whose 
members are reportedly seeking to put an end to the war they 
have been waging for several years. 
  According to "QAP" and EL ESPECTADOR, on Wednesday, 16 
February, a meeting that was initially scheduled as a 
continuation of questioning turned into a friendly encounter 
between Carlos Mario Alzate Urquijo, "El Arete" [earring], 
Carlos Aguilar Gallego, "El Mugre" [grime], their attorneys, and 
Luis Guillermo Angel Restrepo, apparently a liaison with the 
Cali Cartel. The meeting was reportedly held at the office of 
Cruz Helena Aguilar Echeverry, chief of the Drug Trafficking 
Unit of the Regional Prosecutors Office. 
  Although there has been speculation recently about a 
rapprochement between the members of the two cartels, especially 
since the death of Pablo Escobar, this is the first time anyone 
has heard of a formal meeting between arrested members of the 
Medellin Cartel and an emissary from the Cali Cartel in the 
presence of a judicial authority. 
  On orders from Prosecutor Aguilar, the two arrested men were 
transferred from La Picota to the Regional Prosecutors Office to 
participate in the continuation of questioning. "El Arete" and 
"El Mugre" and their attorneys arrived at Aguilar's office after 
0915. Aguilar took them right in, declining to use the special 
cubicles that are used to ensure that the declarants do not 
recognize their interrogators. Instead, she took them into the 
conference room next door to her office. 
  While the prosecutor, the arrestees, and their attorneys 
were 
speaking informally, Luis Guillermo Angel Restrepo appeared. "El 
Arete" and "El Mugre" recognized him and told him of their 
concern about the war they have been waging against members of 
the Cali Cartel, and their desire to reach peace between the two 
sides. "This war has screwed us all," one of the arrestees said. 
  What was originally scheduled as an official appearance for 
questioning ended up being "a veritable orgy," in the words of 
EL ESPECTADOR. Indeed, at about 1445, "El Arete" sent out for 40 
boxes of chicken and 40 soft drinks for those who were present 
at the questioning as well as the security personnel. By the end 
of the afternoon, Angel Restrepo left the office having pledged 
to travel to Cali and seek a real rapprochement between the two 
sides. 
  The arrestees reportedly told Prosecutor Aguilar that they 
were worried about the charges against them and reiterated their 
willingness to cooperate with the authorities. 
  This news also surprised the prosecutor general. Although at 
first he denied that members of the two cartels had met in the 
presence of one of his subordinates, he ended up admitting that 
the prosecutor knew "El Mugre" from before, because they had 
gone to grade school together. He stated, however, that this 
would not prevent her from carrying out her judicial duties. 
  De Greiff termed the first reports by the media "monstrous," 
but he warned that the Prosecutor General's Office cannot allow 
itself to be used for this kind of activity, which seriously 
tarnishes the institution's image. He also explained that an 
entity with primarily judicial functions cannot be used as an 
intermediary between criminal organizations. 
  Aside from the anecdotes emerging from the meeting, the 
greatest concern is that some of what little evidence has been 
gathered against the two cartels is based on information 
provided by the Cali people against the Medellin people and vice 
versa. Therefore, an agreement between these two groups could 
turn into a mutual pact of silence, to the obvious detriment of 
the investigations.

  [Text] According to a report that "NTC News" has obtained, 
Roberto Escobar plans to reorganize the Medellin Cartel's 
terrorist network from the Itagui jail. After Pablo Escobar's 
death, a struggle took place within the Medellin Cartel for its 
control. As a result, Roberto Escobar was attacked. It is 
believed a group under the leadership of Fidel Castano, alias 
Rambo, was behind this attack. Gustavo Tapia, alias Techo; Luis 
Carlos Molina Jepes; Miguel Angel Builen; and (?Mickey Ramirez) 
comprise the group. 
  The members of the splinter group hit by Pablo Escobar are 
demanding the return of their properties that were seized and 
$20 million. To meet these demands, Pablo Escobar's widow Maria 
Victoria Henao; her brother Fernando Henao, alias Hierbas; and 
those incarcerated in the Bogota jails, Carlos Mario Urquijo, 
Fernando Pozada Fierro, Luis Carlos Aguilar, and Gustavo 
Gutierrez Arrula have reached an agreement through attorneys to 
return all the properties. This group, under the leadership of 
Rafael Galeano and Mireya Moncada, are supported by the Cali 
cartel and Fidel Castano. In addition, they demand that all the 
properties of all the cartel members who are incarcerated be 
returned as compensation for the deaths of their relatives. This 
agreement has been accepted by some of the incarcerated 
individuals and by Pablo Escobar's widow. 
  Roberto Escobar, as successor to the Medellin Cartel chief, 
however, does not accept this agreement. Therefore, he wants the 
inmates to be transferred from Santa Fe de Bogota to Medellin to 
reorganize and reactive the militias and the gangs that have 
always operated with Medellin Cartel funds.

  [Text] Ernesto Samper, sole presidential candidate for the 
Liberal Party, received 1,245,000 votes, approximately 50 
percent, in the primary according to the most recent figures 
from the Registrar's Office. Raul Gutierrez has talked with him 
about the vice presidency, the Liberal Party leadership, and the 
government. 
  [Begin recording] [Gutierrez] Will you replace former 
President Turbay in the party's national leadership? 
  [Samper] This depends on Dr. Turbay. I have said he played a 
very satisfactory role in the management of the primary, as 
indicated by Sunday's results. His staying in office will 
depend on his own decision. 
  [Gutierrez] Will Ministers Villegas and Santos be included 
in 
the campaign team? 
  [Samper] If they would like to cooperate with me, they will 
be welcome in the campaign. I would appreciate their effort 
very much. 
  [Gutierrez] How will you play the vice presidency card? 
  [Samper] I will select the person I think can take my place 
according to the Constitution in case of a necessary absence. 
  [Gutierrez] Lleras de la Fuente or Pedro Gomez? 
  [Samper] There is a list of names on which I am working. 
  [Gutierrez] How will you reconciliate yourself with your 
adversaries of yesterday? 
  [Samper] With programs. I think the idea is not to reach 
bureaucratic agreements, rather, to identify ourselves with a 
subject that became the common denominator in our 
campaign--social policy. 
  [Gutierrez] Don't you think the high rate of abstentionism 
poses a risk when you run against Pastrana in May? 
  [Samper] No, because abstentionism is not caused by 
Pastrana, 
rather, objective factors that we will naturally have to correct 
gradually. 
  [Gutierrez] What did the government do for your campaign for 
your candidacy to be successful? 
  [Samper] Nothing, except remain neutral. I did the rest.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Colombian elections, 
scheduled for 8 May 1994. 
  Presidential hopefuls expressed their opinions on whether 
tax 
evaders should be jailed. Humberto De la Calle said that 
fiscal policy should specify jail sentences for tax evasion, 
especially now that illegal enrichment is an important issue. 
Carlos Lemos Simmonds said he also favors harsh punishment for 
tax evasion. General Miguel Maza Marquez said tax evaders should 
be jailed, but he added that other measures are also necessary. 
(Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 
1730 GMT 3 Mar 94) 
  Humberto De la Calle criticized Ernesto Samper's reluctance 
to debate him, saying that Samper lacks a firm willingness to 
make changes and to establish a truly independent position. De 
la Calle also criticized Samper's plans to reimpose certain 
taxes and to eliminate international agreements signed with 
Venezuela and Ecuador. He also claims that candidate Samper is 
contradictory; for example, Samper advocated the legalization of 
drugs, then changed his mind. 
  Lemos Simmonds criticized candidates who are avoiding 
debates. He said that the Liberal Party and the Colombian voters 
are the losers because the election will involve more guesswork. 
Carlos Lleras de la Fuente also criticized those who have 
avoided a debate between New Democratic Force Candidate Andres 
Pastrana and Liberal Party candidates. 
  For his part, Pastrana reaffirmed his intention to defend 
and 
support coffee growers during his administration while on a tour 
in Caldas Department. Pastrana called for education reforms and 
added that women should play the role they deserve in society. 
(Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 
0130 GMT 6 Mar 94) 
  According to the most recent poll by the National 
Consultation Center, Samper and Pastrana are tied. Samper 
claims he continues to lead the polls and is quite confident he 
will win the elections. He denies claims that Pastrana is doing 
well even though Pastrana does not have an electoral mechanism 
behind him yet. Samper said that such mechanisms are becoming 
less important in modern elections because Colombians are not 
stupid. 
  Pastrana campaign manager Luis Alberto Moreno said that 
Samper's popularity is decreasing and that Pastrana's is on the 
rise. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in 
Spanish 1730 GMT 7 Mar 94) 
  All presidential hopefuls closed campaigns in public squares 
on 6 March. Pastrana visited several municipalities in Caldas 
Department, where he promised to support coffee growers. Gen. 
Maza Marquez visited Villavicencio and Suba, where he said peace 
can be consolidated through the development of social policies. 
Samper visited Barranquilla, where he vowed to fight poverty. 
De la Calle visited Santa Fe de Bogota, where he said that his 
administration will be characterized by investment. Antonio 
Navarro of the 19 April Movement Democratic Alliance closed his 
campaign in Medellin by saying he will do whatever it takes to 
see that no child goes to bed hungry in Colombia. Lemos visited 
Cucuta, where he vowed to open a university. Liberal Party 
hopeful Rodolfo Gonzalez visited Bucaramanga and insisted on a

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Early this morning, Colombia and Great Britain 
signed an agreement to promote and protect investments, just as 
the "24 Hours" newscast has already mentioned in an exclusive 
report. 
  The article on compensation, which had originally delayed 
the 
signing of the agreement eight months ago, now reads as follows: 
  Principle of expropriation with just, adequate, and 
effective 
compensation -- by virtue of this principle acknowledged by the 
Constitution, the state will not expropriate, unless it is of 
public or social interest, foreign capital investments in a 
discriminatory manner or without previously paying fair, 
adequate, and effective compensation. 
  According to some experts, this article runs against the 
spirit of Article 58 of the national Constitution, according to 
which there can be special compensations for the sake of equity. 
Nevertheless, in the agreement signed today in London, Colombia 
promised to always pay compensation. Despite changes made to 
the article that had prompted Britain's original refusal to sign 
the accord, there still places in which it contradicts the 
national Constitution. These contradictions likely will come up 
when the Constitutional Court and Congress review the agreement. 
  [Begin recording of constitutional expert Luis Carlos 
Sachica] A fair, effective, and adequate compensation might turn 
out to be completely different from what the Constitution says 
considers prior compensation -- compensation in which the 
interests of both the community and the affected parties are 
taken into consideration. [end recording] 
  The new agreement basically seeks to protect the interests 
of 
British investors.

<F P=106> [Article by Myriam Astrid Montoya: "62 Billion Pesos for </F>
Rural Employment"] 
  [Text] Between September of 1992 and the same month in 
1993, the number of unemployed persons in rural areas rose 12.2 
percent. 
  The 246,101 unemployed workers were joined by another 30,000 
now searching for a way to earn a few pesos to dig themselves 
out of the "hole" they are in. 
  Unemployment has turned into one of the most serious 
consequences of the crisis faced by the agricultural sector in 
the past three years, especially in the case of such crops as 
cotton, sorghum, tobacco, rice, and coffee. Given the loss of 
profitability and the smaller crop area planted, the demand for 
workers has plummeted. 
  The national and municipal governments are both rushing to 
launch a large number of projects of common benefit in order to 
provide remunerative jobs for those out of work. 
  Resources available this year total some 62 billion pesos, 
money it is hoped will generate roughly 6.2 million days of 
work, the equivalent of 24,800 full-time jobs. 
<H5>  Emergency Measure </H5>
  The Ministry of Agriculture came up with the idea as a 
result 
of its analysis of the difficult social situation created by the 
crisis in agriculture. 
  After examining the alternatives last year, the ministry 
designed an emergency program to create jobs by undertaking 
labor-intensive projects that would benefit the community such 
as roads, aqueducts, and reforestation. 
  The government's Program To Generate Rural Employment (PGE) 
was formally approved by CONPES [National Council for Economic 
and Social Policy] in June and went into operation in September 
1993, when it was given a budget of $900 million. 
  Ricardo Vargas del Valle, adviser to the minister and 
director of the PGE, explained that the resources were 
incorporated into the DRI [Integrated Rural Development Program] 
Fund. The latter then drafted a fiduciary contract (the first of 
its kind) for its management by the Fiduciary Department of the 
People's Bank. 
  However, since the projects are to be cofinanced, the 
municipalities standing to benefit from them contributed another 
1.3 billion pesos, raising the sum available in 1993 to 2.2 
billion pesos. 
  Vargas del Valle said the resources should be made available 
during the first half of this year and thus help relieve 
unemployment problems in the departments of Atlantico, Cesar, 
Cordoba, Magdalena, Sucre, Meta, Risaralda, Huila, and Tolima. 
  However, the funds supplied by the PGE directly are not the 
only resources. Vargas del Valle also noted that some 32 billion 
pesos were allocated in 1993 to finance rural development 
projects in the same regions through entities such as the DRI, 
Agrarian Fund, PNR [National Rehabilitation Plan], and Himat. 
  When last year's balance is combined with these two sources 
of funding, projects on the drawing board will provide 3.4 
million days of work. 
<H5>  More Money for 1994 </H5>
  In addition to these funds and projects, the General Rural 
Employment Program starts this fiscal year with a budget of 6 
billion pesos in the DRI. When that sum is combined with 
cofinancing from municipalities, the total is 12 billion pesos. 
  When one adds the 52 billion channeled through other 
national 
and territorial entities via labor-intensive rural development 
programs, the grand total for 1994 is 62 billion pesos. 
  The departments benefiting from this new allocation are 
Atlantico, Bolivar, Sucre, Cesar, Tolima, Huila, Caldas, 
Risaralda, Valle, Cauca, Meta, and Narino. 
  It is estimated that projects planned using this year's 
funding will provide 6.2 million days of work. 
<H5>  Details </H5>
  Explaining just how the program operates, Vargas del Valle 
said that after identifying the most urgent areas and assigning 
priorities to projects, the DRI is ordering the fiduciary 
enterprise to negotiate the respective contracts with the 
municipalities. 
  The latter will in turn hire local workers, which means that 
the projects will take longer and be somewhat more costly. 
Specialized personnel are excepted from this rule. 
  Programs eligible basically include roads, aqueducts, 
marketing, housing, reforestation, irrigation, agroindustry, and 
fish farming, as well as special projects for the integrated 
management of drilling.

<F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The State Council has touched on the most sensitive 
issue for multinational oil companies in Colombia by ruling that 
those companies must leave when their contracts expire. Guido 
Nule Amin, energy and mines minister, fears that the decision 
will scare away foreign capital. 
  The State Council's decision to eliminate the possibility of 
automatically renewing grant contracts signed with Colombia fell 
on the foreign oil companies like a bucket of cold water. 
  [Begin Shell official Luis Enrique Conde recording] Shell 
has 
asked the Colombian Government to extend its contract for 10 
years beginning in 1994. Considering the points we have 
mentioned, Shell expects the government to grant the extension. 
[end recording] 
  Guido Nule Amin, mines and energy minister, believes the 
ruling jeopardizes foreign investment in Colombia. 
  [Begin Nule Amin recording] The disadvantage that the 
ministry and the government see in this ruling is that it 
weakens the relationship with and the expectations of foreign 
investor companies. [end recording] 
  Five contracts signed between Ecopetrol and the 
multinational 
corporations Esso, Texpet, Jocol, and Petronor, which extract 
crude oil in Lower, Middle, and Upper Magdalena and in the 
Catatumbo Basin, will expire this year. Ecopetrol will take 
over all installations and oil fields now in the hands of those 
companies.

<F P=106> [Article for EL DIARIO ECONOMICO] </F>
  [Text] The results yielded by the main variables of the 
Employers Opinion Poll conducted by the Federation for Higher 
Education and Development (FEDESARROLLO) show that during the 
first half of 1993, industry encountered serious difficulties 
that were reflected in a slump in levels of economic activity, 
but that tended to turn around during the second half of the 
year. 
  August marked the beginning of a recovery in terms of levels 
of losses and reductions in inventories, and increasing numbers 
of employers reported a more favorable economic situation. 
  They were also more optimistic about the country's economic 
and sociopolitical conditions that would them to carry out 
investment programs. 
  All of these responses were taken from the private economic 
research firm's monthly poll of over 400 industrialists in the 
country's main development sectors. 
  When one takes a closer look at the various subsectors, 
however, the results are highly dissimilar. 
  On the one hand, some sectors were helped by the vigorous 
growth in internal demand. 
  These sectors produce goods not easily marketed abroad, and 
their activities are linked to the production of durable 
consumer goods, construction in particular. 
  This group includes industries that produce cement and 
building materials, wood and manufactured products made from 
wood, equipment, and electrical items. 
  On the other hand, thanks to the recovery of exports, 
another 
group managed to reverse the levels of losses suffered during 
the first half of the year. 
  This group includes plastics manufacturers and printing 
shops 
and publishing houses. 
  By the month of October, plastics exports had increased in 
value by 68 percent, which can be explained by the vigor of 
sales to the United States and the Andean Group. Sales of 
publishing houses and printing shops rose 4 percent. 
  To a lesser extent and more as a reaction to the domestic 
market, a recovery was visible among producers of processed 
foods, porcelain and glass, basic metals, metal products, and 
nonelectrical machinery. 
  This last group includes sectors greatly affected by the 
economic liberalization program [apertura] and the revaluation 
of the peso. Many were able to compensate--although only 
partially--for their loss of domestic market shares by increased 
exports to neighboring countries. They are the textile 
industries, leather and manufactured leather goods, paper and 
cardboard, industrial chemical substances, and rubber products. 
  Textiles found a better market in Venezuela with a 
90-percent 
increase in sales. Likewise, producers of leather goods 
(excluding shoes) sold 123 percent more to that country than 
during the same months of the previous year. 
  Paper mills sold 78 percent more products to Venezuela and 
60 
percent more to the rest of the Andean Group countries. 
  Sales to Venezuela by manufacturers of industrial chemical 
substances dropped 16 percent, but rose to Peru, Ecuador (17 
percent), and other South American countries (over 20 percent). 
  Special mention should be made of the transport equipment 
and 
materials sector, which joined with construction in leading the 
sector throughout 1992, substantially reducing their level of 
losses starting in the first quarter of 1993. 
  Nevertheless, levels of production and orders at the end of 
the year are far higher than they were previous to 1991. This 
sector benefited greatly from the liberalization of trade since 
it was able to import consumable expenditures at a lower cost. 
It was also aided by lower interest rates and the expansion of 
credit that boosted demand. 
  Nevertheless, the high levels of sales of national and 
imported vehicles in late 1992 and early 1993 came in response 
to demand, which explains the abovementioned behavior of this 
industry's main indicators. 
  It is one more sector that benefited from expanded access to 
the Venezuelan market: During the first 10 months of 1993, 
exports rose by 143 percent. 
  Finally, the results of the poll show that the utilization 
of 
the installed capacity of industry in 1993, 77.2 percent, did 
not suffer major variations in terms of its behavior over the 
past five months. However, that figure did increase for 
beverages, ready-to-wear, leather, plastics, cement, and glass 
and porcelain.

  [Text] Santiago de Chile, 14 Mar (EFE) -- Costa Rican 
Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, a candidate for the OAS General 
Secretariat, has stressed that his most serious contender, 
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, has been "ill advised." 
Niehaus believes Gaviria will probably withdraw his candidacy 
in the next few days. 
  In an interview published today in the newspaper LA NACION, 
Niehaus says: "He has eight votes and I do not know how he can 
allow himself, as an incumbent president, to be the subject of a 
fiasco." 
  Niehaus added: "Knowing him as a very serious and respected 
person, it would be logical for him to withdraw in favor of the 
majority candidacy." 
  Niehaus was asked about alleged U.S. pressure in favor of 
the 
Colombian president's candidacy. He stressed that these rumors 
persist, adding that the U.S. has exercised pressure, "which 
will increase." 
  He noted: "I did not even want to ask for evidence on this. 
I went to the United States to ask them not to apply pressure, 
for the sake of the OAS." 
  The OAS member countries will elect the new OAS secretary 
general on 27 March from among the current candidates: Bernd 
Niehaus, Cesar Gaviria, and Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel 
Angel Burelli. 
  Niehaus told the journalists who attended President Eduardo 
Frei's inauguration in Chile that for 40 years the OAS has been 
controlled by large countries and the time has come for small 
countries to run it. 
  Niehaus said: "We strongly asked to be allowed to 
participate 
because there should be no first- or second-rate states in the 
Inter-American system." He added that his candidacy is not just 
Costa Rican, it is regional. 
  Niehaus confirmed that he has 22 well-documented votes from 
Central America, the Caribbean, and three South American 
countries, including Chile, a country that has confirmed its 
support for him. 
  In the Chilean morning newspaper interview, the Costa Rican 
foreign minister confirmed his confidence that he will be 
victorious and announced that he would politically revitalize 
the OAS.

Republic is a serious obstacle to any resolution of the crisis. 
In an interview with Signal FM, Beauge acknowledged that the

of the crisis. He says a modus operandi must be developed to 
keep the nation from bearing the brunt of divergences among 
senators. 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] If the situation in the Senate 
remains as it is -- already a great handicap -- it will continue 
to prevent a resolution because any and all decisions, even if 
President Aristide consents to the plan, require that the Senate 
take certain steps that fall within the scope of its 
responsibilities. [passage omitted] [end recording]

the embargo against Haiti. The Artibonite representative, who

the statements by the Dominican president as sensible, 
explaining that an end must be put to the sufferings of the 
Haitian people. 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] [Dupiton] It is the first 
sensible statement we have heard since we began hearing official 
comments on the Haitian issue. I can only congratulate Joaquin 
Balaguer because the misery of the people must truly end. I 
agree 100 percent, and congratulate Joaquin Balaguer because I 
am also very sensitive to the misery of my brothers.

thinking about a possible reinforcement of economic sanctions 
against Haiti within about 15 days. What is your opinion on that 
score?

Council. 
  [Luckenson] What actions will you set in motion in 
parliament? 
  [Dupiton] It is when we.... [pauses] I can give my opinion 
on 
such a thing. The only thing is that we would like the people to

  [Text] A council called the Initiatives Committee [Comite 
d'Initiatives] was formed on 12 March at the Visa Lodge Hotel. 
The purpose of this committee is to analyze the current 
situation and come up with proposals for a way out of the 
crisis. The committee includes the following: Jacques 
Saint-Louis, former deputy under President Leslie Francois 
Manigat; Emmanuel Menard; and Hubert de Ronceray, leader of the 
Mobilization for National Development. 
  Those who participated agree that it is imperative that a 
harmonious way out of the crisis be found, based on the dominant 
theme of national reconciliation. To that end, a committee 
called the Coordinating Committee for National Mobilization was 
elected, including Professor Gregoire Eugene, leader of the 
Haitian Social Christian Party; Joseph Willio Noailles; Jacques 
Saint-Louis; Max Antoine, Jr.; Gabriel Augustin, leader of the 
Assembly of Democrats for the Republic; Jean-Auguste Bellerice; 
Dieudonne Laroche; Cyprien Cicier; and Daniel Narcisse, leader 
of the Federated Party of the Liaison of Democratic Forces. 
  This committee will be in charge of coordinating with the 
various political parties, organizations, and authorities, 
working both in Haiti and abroad, steps aimed at mobilizing the 
vital forces of the nation and reviving in Haitians a sense of 
duty toward the common homeland. The goal of this initiative is 
concerted action in the broadest sense, for a lasting solution 
to the crisis. The Initiatives Committee, which sponsored this 
meeting, makes a point of thanking those who participated in it 
and congratulating members elected to the head of this 
committee, wishing them productive work. 
  This was signed by Jacques Saint-Louis of the Initiatives 
Committee.

  [Text] The situation remains unchanged in the Senate of the 
Republic, with a conflict between the two groups of senators who 
are vying for the Senate office. It should be noted that a 
meeting of the members of the Alliance for Parliamentary 
Cohesion [ACP] was held on 11 March. The Alliance is attempting 
to mend its own divisions. On 11 March, the members and 
dissidents of this parliamentary bloc held their meeting in the 
Diplomatic Room of the Legislative Palace. 
  In a communique issued after the meeting, the members of the 
Alliance asserted that they had made a commitment to refrain 
from making any statements likely to undermine the moral 
integrity of any member of the bloc. They agreed to work without 
respite to find a solution acceptable to all parties involved in 
the crisis in the Senate as soon as possible. They also asserted 
that only the president of the Alliance, Senator Dejean 
Belizaire, elected in the contested 18 January 1993 elections, 
could engage the Alliance in news briefings. 
  This is an update of the situation in the Senate, a 
situation 
of conflict in which the U.S. Embassy also took a stand in 
choosing to back the camp of Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis. The U.S. 
Embassy spokesman, Stanley Scharger, has encouraged the Haitian 
legislators and those elected on 18 January to respect the New 
York pact while awaiting the decision of an arbitration 
committee.

<F P=106> [Interview with Armando Calderon Sol and Enrique Borgo </F>
Bustamante, Nationalist Republican Alliance candidates for 
president and vice president, respectively, by unidentified LA 
PRENSA GRAFICA reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [LA PRENSA GRAFICA] How do you view other political 
parties' proposals vis-a-vis yours when we are virtually a week 
away from the elections? 
  [Calderon] Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance] has had a 
coherent proposal for a long time, even during the difficult 
period when communist and Marxist ideas were popular in Latin 
America. Our party has always presented a clear proposal, since 
its birth. It has made an economic proposal in defense of 
individual rights, the market economy, private property, and, 
particularly, the state of law. 
  Now we see that opposition candidates are planning to 
present 
a similar program, although they lack the credibility necessary 
to do so. However, we have noticed a change in their language, 
and that has changed the campaign: it has made it more 
pragmatic, it is using a similar language, by which all can 
picture the social problems. 
  What I see is a greater awareness among all sectors 
regarding 
the country's social problems. I believe it is the product of 
the war experience per se. The fact that all Salvadorans have a 
clearer vision of the social problems has made possible that all 
programs better target social welfare. 
  [LA PRENSA GRAFICA] What does your campaign's concept of 
Arena being the new socially aware right mean? 
  [Calderon] What we mean is that Arena represents the right 
with social consciousness, a right that faces social problems 
with courage. It is not socialist, corporate, or Marxist ideas, 
but ideas founded on a true Christian humanism that make up the 
contemporary world, and turn man into a being of solidarity. 
The philosophy of the new right is that profound. There cannot 
be true economic development if we do not involve social 
welfare, human progress. 
  Here is the success of the new right in the world: it is 
opening possibilities, leaving behind populist and socialist 
ideas and positions that gave leaders a demagogic vocabulary, 
and that led Latin America to poverty in the past decades. This 
new right is causing countries to reemerge with new positions, 
sustained economic growth, and facing social problems, reducing 
poverty levels, and boosting economic indicators. 
  [LA PRENSA GRAFICA] And now that you have been touring the 
country and getting in touch with the national situation, how 
would you summarize the social offers your government is 
proposing? 
  [Borgo] We are very satisfied with the expressions of civic 
awareness and education Salvadorans have given. Past experience 
shows us that people strongly believe in democracy. 
  These opportunities and discussions with the people promote 
high participation. We believe that Salvadorans are receptive 
regarding compliance with the law and the state of law. People 
respond favorably when they hear us talk about the need to stop 
violence, respect the laws and life. 
  Regarding our program, the economic aspect has been the best 
publicized. Regarding the social aspect, we have received very 
positive feedback when people hear that we want to work in 
education, health, and the environment, among other areas. 
  Education is the tool needed so that people can aspire for 
opportunities to grow. We have absolute trust in education 
because it constitutes the key to the country's progress. We 
plan to broaden such programs as Educo and Sabe, which began 
during President Cristiani's term. 
  The loss experienced in the area of education during the war 
period was enormous: almost 700 schools were closed and over 
150,000 children could not attend. We are determined 100 
percent to make education and physical reconstruction our main 
concern. 
  [LA PRENSA GRAFICA] What proposals are necessary to achieve 
a type of economic and social welfare in which people can 
actively participate? 
  [Borgo] We see the need to increase foreign currency in the 
country. Family remittances are a fragile source of funds that 
might decrease, and even if current levels are maintained, we 
can expect to see a decrease in international aid. 
  We are trying to promote the export of nontraditional 
products, and we want to broaden our prospects for tourism. 
  If we might draw something positive from a negative 
experience, it would be that the 10-year war put us on the world 
map. In turn, we might be able to take advantage of this, 
because we have many tourist attractions, the foremost of which 
is our people. Salvadorans are pleasant and willing to help. We 
can be very successful at promoting tourism. 
  Another major initiative will be to get Salvadorans abroad 
to 
invest here. We are trying to create a program with investment 
tools that can be joined by people who receive family allowances. 
  These two ideas are important. We have been working on these 
projects for a long time. When the director of the World 
Tourism Organization visited, we were able to get all of the 
political parties to commit themselves to developing the tourism 
industry. 
  So far, we have outlined four pillars of this development 
program. 
  [LA PRENSA GRAFICA] Recently, the Salvadoran Foundation for 
Economic and Social Development [Fusades] presented an economic 
program that was reportedly open to all political parties. Is 
there any similarity between this program and your plan? 
  [Borgo] What Fusades presented is a summary of a political 
strategy. It was explained that a number of studies comprised 
the basis of that summary. This package must be analyzed 
thoroughly, but we do agree that it necessarily concurs with the 
party's economic and social philosophy. Nevertheless, we 
believe it is very useful. 
  [LA PRENSA GRAFICA] What do you think, Dr. Calderon? 
  [Calderon] I believe it is a true contribution to El 
Salvador 
and that it fully corresponds with our party. We have somewhat 
of a similar philosophy with the people from Fusades. We must 
also recall that President Cristiani's program received 
significant input from Fusades. In a second government, there 
will also be continuity, because ours is not simply a five-year 
program. 
  The country is being rescued; Arena's program is not over, 
but just beginning. Our program is designed to achieve peace, 
progress, freedom, democracy, justice, and better living 
conditions for the country. 
  Now that we are heading toward an economic recovery, peace 
has helped guide the country toward reconstruction. We still 
have a long way to go before we reach the desired levels. We 
have always said that our program is not limited to five years; 
there is no way that it could be. This is why we hope people 
will reelect us on 20 March -- to enable us to continue with our 
program. 
  [LA PRENSA GRAFICA] President Cristiani's government will go 
down in history as the government that achieved peace. Where 
will you lead your government if you win the elections? 
  [Calderon] I would like my government to be a government of 
reconstruction, not only a physical reconstruction, but also 
moral, cultural, and civic reconstruction. People should 
experience a renewal. 
  We believe we can strengthen the peace that has been 
achieved, bolster the democratic process, and fulfill the great 
goal of rebuilding the country structurally and morally.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 10 Mar (EFE) -- Colombian 
Agriculture Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo has said Colombia will 
sell rice, African palm oil, pork, poultry, and grain to Cuba in 
keeping with a preliminary agreement signed between both 
countries. 
  Colombia and Cuba also agreed in February that Colombia 
would 
sell 20,000 barrels of oil per day to the island, a fact that 
has provoked protests from opponents of Cuban President Fidel 
Castro's regime. 
  The preliminary agreements for food sales were the result of 
Colombian Deputy Agriculture Minister Santiago Perry's visit to 
Havana. Perry has said Cuba will design and build a pilot plant 
for the production of biological control measures in Colombia. 
Likewise, a joint project will be developed to obtain banana 
strains resistant to Black Sigatoka via genetic engineering 
techniques, and research will be conducted to combat the white 
fly, which attacks vegetables. 
  Colombian Agriculture Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo will 
travel to Havana shortly to ratify the agreements.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 14 Mar (NA) -- Vice Foreign Minister 
Fernando Petrella said today that if Argentina has no medical 
patents law "it will be very difficult to get investments and 
import advanced technology." 
  Petrella said: "If we want to introduce the country into a 
market such as the U.S. market, we cannot go on without a 
patents law." 
  In this regard, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
reportedly told President Carlos Menem in Chile on 11 March that 
if no progress on that law is made in Congress by 30 April, 
Argentina would be eliminated from the list of candidates to 
join NAFTA. 
  Regarding the request made by UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Butrus Ghali that the Argentine Government send more Blue 
Helmets to Bosnia, Petrella said this is "highly gratifying for 
our foreign policy and the Armed Forces, which are the 
participants in this peace process." 
  In comments made in the "Puzzle" program of the Rock and Pop 
FM station, Petrella said our country "conveyed to the United 
Nations that we will only participate if we get weapons similar 
to the ones the other units have."

  [Text] Luis Donaldo Colosio, PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate, said on 11 March 
the Legislative and Judicial Branches must be reformed to ensure 
a better balance in the ongoings of the country. 
  [Begin Colosio recording] Our Legislative Branch must be 
reformed not only to establish more and better laws to protect 
citizens, but also to exert social and political controls over 
the Executive Branch. [end recording] 
  He said an excessive concentration of power has led us to 
commit abuses in Mexico, adding this is why it is time to 
implement a policy with a human touch. Colosio made these 
statements at a meeting with 800 Rotary Club members in Mexico 
City. His wife, Diana Laura Riojas, also spoke at the event. 
She said the strengthening of family ties must be a permanent 
governmental duty. She also talked about disabled people. 
  [Begin Riojas recording] We reject all forms of 
discrimination within society. We are determined to find 
solutions to the disabled's demands for education, employment, 
health services, recreation, and culture. [end recording] 
  Colosio continued his campaign in Mexico City and talked to 
PRI members from four electoral districts in Atzcapotzalco, 
where he commented on PRI members' duties. 
  He added competitiveness and pluralism are being promoted 
within the PRI to ensure it becomes the nation's political 
force. Colosio met with members of the Mexican-Lebanese 
community during the afternoon of 11 March. He stressed the 
importance of the Lebanese community in Mexico's development. 
He said his objective is to achieve an economy that offers 
investors certainty and clear-cut guidelines.

<F P=106> [By Juan Ramon Rojas] </F>
  [Text] San Jose, 9 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Strengthening 
relations with the United States, a greater rapprochement with 
Central and South American countries, and a vigorous effort to 
incorporate Costa Rica into world commerce will guide foreign 
policy during the new social democratic government to be 
inaugurated on 8 May. 
  Foreign Minister-designate Fernando Narajo has said Costa 
Rican foreign policy will play a more dynamic and expedient role 
in promoting trade and attracting investments, as well as in 
seeking to overcome the differences that have marked ties with 
Washington during the current government. 
  "We want our officials to play a very important role abroad, 
and to that effect we are proposing every mission have a 
specific work program we will evaluate periodically," Naranjo 
told ACAN-EFE shortly after his appointment was announced. 
  Naranjo, a 51-year-old economist, former finance minister, 
and adviser of several regional countries, said with this work 
"one is not trying to supplant" his foreign commerce colleague, 
Jose Rossi, "rather, to get our missions to do a good commercial 
work." 
  The future foreign minister has said he will seek to further 
ties with Central America, as he is convinced a small country 
such as Costa Rica "can only have an impact on economic 
relations if it works closely with the other regional 
countries." In addition to Central America, Naranjo has said 
he will also pay special attention to relations with Chile, 
Colombia, and Venezuelan, nations with which Costa Rica "has 
many commercial possibilities" in view of the increase in 
exchange that has been registered in the past years. 
  Naranjo has said his country's incorporation into the North 
American Free Trade Agreement, signed by Canada, the United 
States, and Mexico, "will be vital," which is why "we need good 
representations in Washington, Ottawa, and Mexico City." 
  After three years of negotiations, Costa Rica and Mexico 
agreed to sign a free trade agreement that will become effective 
in January of next year and will allow, according to 
projections, a rapid increase of commercial exchange and 
investments between the two countries. Along these lines, he 
said the other aspect on which he will focus his attention is 
the delegation to be named in Geneva (Switzerland, GATT 
headquarters). 
  "We are going to place a great deal of stress on all of 
this," Naranjo has said. He flew to Chile today to accompany 
President-elect Jose Maria Figueres to attend the inauguration 
of Eduardo Frei. This is Figueres' first trip outside the 
country since he won the elections on 6 February. 
  The future foreign minister also said "it is no secret" 
relations with Washington have cooled over demands by U.S. labor 
unions and lawsuits filed regarding expropriations made in the 
past 20 years. 
  "The United States has been complaining we are not paying 
attention to a series of problems that are not major, although, 
as a whole, they cause problems," and he admitted that during 
Figueres' visit to Washington in April they hope to have "very 
frank" conversations to agree on what "we must do to improve 
those relations." 
  "What is true is in today's world of strategic alliances we 
cannot fight with our friends," the economist has warned. 
  Naranjo has said Costa Rica has had a "longstanding" 
friendship with Washington, and it is not fair that "minor 
problems should be causing major differences." 
  The future foreign minister, who will replace Bernd Niehaus 
on 8 May, said another area of action will be promoting human 
rights, the democratic system, and civilian rule, as "Costa Rica 
has traditionally been doing." 
  In this respect, he announced creation of the Foreign 
Cooperation Agency for Human Development [Agencia de Cooperacion 
Exterior para el Desarrollo Humano], which will have the double 
function of coordinating the assistance Costa Rica receives and 
funneling this country's cooperation to other nations. 
  "Costa Rica can play a very different role in the future of 
many Central American nations and the Caribbean with this 
cooperation agency," for which it hopes to also have the support 
of "friendly countries," Naranjo has said.

<F P=106> [Inauguration speech by President Eduardo Frei from </F>
Constitution Square in Santiago -- live] 
  [Text] Chileans: When one democratic term ends and another 
stage of republican life begins, the young and the young at 
heart wonder about their dreams, about love, and -- in a 
nutshell -- about the reason for their existence. 
  Political work -- in its noblest form -- seeks to create the 
opportunities and conditions to achieve the basic human 
aspiration of true happiness. 
  This higher objective of politics becomes more evident in 
countries like ours, where government actions many times play a 
decisive role in people's destiny. 
  Yesterday, I became the president of all Chileans 
[applause], 
and I now announce the way in which I will conduct the national 
community in this march toward solidarity, justice, and freedom. 
  My position stems from Chilean history, and I will seek to 
answer the following question: On what foundations should we 
base the new meaning of our mission? It is essential to listen 
to our heroes, to our poets, and to our saints. 
  General Bernardo O'Higgins is behind me; Minister Diego 
Portales is in front of me; Captain Arturo Prat is further away, 
near the sea. They are the nation's liberators, the builders of 
the Republic, and the heros of the Republic. They remind us of 
our tradition of honor, dignity, sacrifice, and the impersonal 
nature of power. 
  Can you here the noise of the boys and girls of Elqui [a 
region in Chile], preaching to the kingdom of children around 
the earth? Do you know that in every language and in every city 
of the world a poet is singing verses of love for the women and 
men of all races and cultures? 
  Can you see Father Eduardo Hurtado [whose canonization has 
been requested] crossing Mapocho River bridges, gathering the 
children who choose hope and the city as their home? 
  We have many heroes, poets, and saints in whom we can find 
the inspiration to give dignity to our lives and to the lives of 
all our fellow countrymen. There are many, and they belong to 
us all. 
  Chile has recovered its tradition. We are the children of a 
single historical adventure, the heirs of a single, powerful 
will to be. 
  A stage ended yesterday: Under President Aylwin's patriotic 
leadership we achieved national reconciliation. [applause] 
  Now we can look each other in the eye and shake hands with 
peace in our spirits. 
  In all collective tasks, the director should indicate his 
style of work. With even more reason, a president must explain 
the exercise of power to his assistants, to the citizens who 
support him, to those who oppose him, and even to those who are 
indifferent. 
  First, I will exercise authority, that is, legitimate 
democratic power. I will respect the principle of authority, 
the majesty of the law, and the impersonal nature of power, and 
I will have them respected. 
  I make an appeal for order to avoid confusion. I will speak 
little, yet I will act firmly. [applause] 
  I must be very clear concerning authority. I will exercise 
the powers of president in the presidential system of government 
under the rules of which I was elected. Reforms in the 
political system, if there are any, will take place in the 
future. It is necessary, however, to end the illusion of 
reducing authority. 
  In nearly all countries of the world the public is demanding 
an increase in authority, in light of the large number of 
corporate interests, the rule of parties, and the de facto 
powers of individuals and groups. 
  As always, Chile requires authority above individual 
perspectives and the interests of groups. 
  I will be the president of all Chileans and the supreme 
commander of the Armed Forces, as a symbol of national unity. 
[applause] 
  Second, under a democratic system, the opposition has the 
double task of achieving consensus and exercising criticism. I 
call upon the leaders of the opposition parties to fully meet 
their responsibilities. Our country requires both their 
cooperation, in drawing up the state's policies, and their 
supervision in order to correct mistakes and failings. 
  I call upon them to persevere in the quest for civilized 
dialogue, in which mutual respect, civic friendship, and joint 
patriotism prevail. 
  My heart is free of resentment and rancor, it is open to all 
spiritual and political families of our nation. 
  New time brings new demands. Broad transformations in our 
country and in the world have made democracy and development 
face a superior phase of evolution. 
  New times compel us to rethink our style of government. That 
is why this evening, rather than outlining the specific 
objective of our program -- which has been widely publicized and 
made known to all Chileans during the electoral campaign -- I 
wish to concentrate on the style of work that I will demand of 
myself and of all my assistants within the government. 
  I want my government to be particularly alert to the needs 
and concerns of the people. The people's needs should be our 
needs. The heart and the eyes of this government should focus on 
the routine life of Chilean people. [applause] 
  Let us not allow government work isolate us in our offices. 
Let us not assume that things must be handled in the way a 
small group of people say. Let us go meet people, listen to 
them. Let us not be afraid of criticism. Let us check offices, 
schools, enterprises, hospitals, and administrative methods. 
  Let us invite people and the broader sector to participate. 
Let us cast off any traces of sectarianism, bureaucracy, or 
statism. Let us join efforts to solve the real problems of each 
Chilean. 
  I will be the first to do this, and I call upon my 
assistants 
to adopt the same style. I will be a president in-the-field, on 
a permanent campaign, not to gain votes, but to be up to date 
with the concerns of my country and to make government action 
dynamic. [applause] 
  Another attitude that must be adopted all over the nation -- 
in the central, regional, and municipal governments -- is that 
of devotion to work. This means to do things well, with 
diligence, and with special care for detail. 
  All sluggishness should be eliminated, from the most 
important to the most insignificant. No streets with garbage, 
no place without ornaments, no dead trees. 
  In the fight against uncivilized apathy, the government must 
be the example. 
  I want those in charge to know every detail of the services 
for which they are responsible, to identify their weak points, 
and to adopt measures to correct deficiencies. 
  I do not want study and analysis to become an excuse for 
indefinite postponement of decisions. I do not want perpetual 
delays to projects that are vital for entire cities. [applause] 
  You have many times seen teams working and achieving fine 
results for people, and others -- with the same resources -- 
simply dragging their feet and accumulating problems. I want 
this difference to stop. The entire administration should 
become a working mechanism that systematically improves the 
quality of its operation and its decisions. 
  I want relations between citizens and the administration to 
be based on maximum respect for people, especially if they are 
old, poor, weak, or sick. [applause] 
  Routine administration service is the minimum that a 
democracy should offer its citizens, whose dignity stems from 
the mere fact of being fellow countrymen. A well-completed job 
considers details, respects citizens, and -- above all -- 
efficiently serves them. 
  Our work must be transparent, without nebulous or dark 
corners. Let us work with our faces toward the country, and with 
frankness. Let us tackle problems instead of burying them. Let 
us maintain our style of never promising what we are unable to 
fulfill. This will be our best guarantee for the people. 
[applause] 
  I want an honest fulfillment of public functions. Our 
society fully disapproves of public officials who profit by or 
misuse resources that belong to all Chileans. [applause] 
  We need to convert this consensus into a will for action. I 
expect officials to be accurately aware of what is happening in 
their respective services, departments, and units, because it is 
part of their responsibilities. 
  As president I will strictly counter any action that 
perverts 
the true sense of public service. In this field I do not want 
any indulgence, no matter how difficult it will be to face 
bitter realities. It is better to act firmly today than to be 
swamped tomorrow by a nationwide practice of corruption. 
  I want to clearly say that I will not yield to any type of 
pressure in order to stop these nefarious practices. I will be 
a president with a firm hand against corruption. [applause] 
  In this task, the practice of the impersonal nature of power 
will be very useful. In everyday practice, Chileans must be 
equal before the law, in big and small issues, in paying taxes, 
and in paying traffic fines. If power is not impersonal, we 
will be building the foundation of corruption, a scourge that 
once unleashed ravages all possibilities of properly running a 
state. 
  The style of this new administration stems from the 
spiritual 
meaning of our action. 
  The objective of the fight against poverty, which faces the 
danger of becoming rhetorical, must be clearly outlined. This 
is an all-encompassing fight. It calls for advanced science and 
technology. Yet above all it calls for sound ethics. 
  The poor who demand immediate action are the poorest among 
the poor. They are spread in the countryside and in the 
outskirts of our cities. They have been punished, generation 
after generation. 
  Their dignity must be returned to them, and the price of 
this 
work is constant, systematic sacrifice. It is not enough to 
allocate subsidies to eliminate poverty. Routine practice, 
procedures, priorities, and policies must be modified. 
  I call upon all Chileans -- especially women and the youth 
-- 
to devote their best energies to free the poor from their 
slavery, thus making their own life more noble by fulfilling a 
noble mission. [applause] 
  Chileans: I am aware that this style of government is 
demanding. Yet you, who were elected to accompany me in this 
task, were chosen to work for the good of people. 
  You were elected to break barriers and problems, and to 
tirelessly work. 
  To govern is a nice task in which our energies are used for 
serving our fellow countrymen, and this is our main reward. 
  I think I have clearly outlined the style that I want for my 
government, and -- within this framework and in this long effort 
-- my team will always have my confidence, support, and 
encouragement. 
  Let me now say a few words about our relations with the 
international community. 
  From time immemorial, we Chileans have lived with the 
mentality of island dwellers. Now the world is one, and we must 
trade products and services with all nations. 
  Likewise, our culture is exposed to all the influences of 
the 
international centers of power. Our nation can no longer seek 
refuge between the mountains and the sea. We have unavoidable 
requirements and international obligations. 
  The globalization of the economy requires from us an 
effective performance in all our world's markets, under all 
skies, within all cultures, in all languages. 
  The entire world was very generous with Chile at a time when 
Chile was in pain and division. We must return what we have 
received, with increased solidarity. [applause] 
  Our main duties involve the Latin American community, our 
neighborhood in the international community. My administration 
will dedicate its best efforts to enhancing ties with countries 
in our region. The key to success lies in transforming the 
diversity of the Latin American peoples into unified goals, in 
order to bolster our economies, improve our sovereignties, and 
have a say in the community of nations. 
  We call ourselves brothers, and we will prove it with 
friendship and mutual cooperation. 
  Fellow countrymen: Being president is not an easy task. I am 
aware that as president I will face disappointments, that many 
times I will feel the heavy burden of major decisions, and also 
the distress of being unable to do anything else. 
  To overcome the loneliness of power, I want to recall the 
faces of thousands of Chileans who have accompanied me in 
countless days. 
  I want to recall the peasants who have expressed their hope 
to me, the youth who have talked to me about their dreams, the 
humble housewife who opened the doors of her house to me. I 
want to recall the workers who in factories and mines told me: 
You can always count on our support. 
  This will be the great force that will accompany me during 
these years, the force to which I will always return for 
strength. 
  This nation, these people have given me multitudinous, 
systematic support. I opened that door [he points at La Moneda 
Palace] with overwhelming electoral support. I have received 
all types of expressions of support, backing, and confidence. I 
heard my name being said on streets and squares. I have reached 
a very high position. 
  But from this high position I can hear my father's voice, 30 
years ago, repeating an old proverb: You placed me in a very 
high position, but you have abandoned me. 
  This evening, with deep humbleness, I ask you: Do not 
abandon 
me, always accompany me, at the service of the nation. Thank 
you very much. Long live Chile! [applause]

  [Excerpt] Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada 
arrived at Silvio Pettirossi international airport this morning. 
He said: "During this visit we will close agreements that will 
be remembered for a long time." Sanchez de Lozada was 
accompanied by his wife and a large entourage of businessmen. He 
was received by President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. According to 
Sanchez de Lozada, natural gas and the two countries' road 
connection will top the presidents' agenda. 
  The Bolivian president said it was an honor and a great 
satisfaction to be in Asuncion. 
  "I think this will be a historic visit. We will achieve many 
things, and we will reach agreements that will be remembered for 
a long time," Sanchez said after the protocol ceremony and still 
on the landing strip. 
  Regarding the agenda's main issues, Sanchez de Lozada said 
the two presidents will talk about the sale of Bolivian gas to 
our country and full integration through a paved highway 
crossing Paraguay's Chaco region, "creating a single heart for 
the entire continent." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The government will invite all organized groups -- 
that eventually will be involved in an integration process in 
view of the hemispheric summit -- to meet after Easter. 
  President Luis Alberto Lacalle, on his return to the 
country, 
commented on Bill Clinton's call for a presidential meeting in 
Miami in December. Lacalle said the U.S. president did not just 
say: I invite you to attend. He said instead: We should work 
together in the period between the time you receive this letter 
and December to make sure that the summit's agenda will be 
enriching and productive. 
  Lacalle understands that Clinton's suggestion is important. 
Countries must join arms; nations must meet more than 
governments; public and private groups from different countries 
must start working together. For instance, commercial chambers, 
educators, and cultural associations should start working 
together. In this manner the summit will be the end of a process 
where groups from different levels, where intermediate 
associations have had a say. 
  [Begin Lacalle recording] The meeting will be difficult but 
the result will be much more productive. A presidential meeting 
is always important, but everything there is concentrated in a 
declaration where each president explains his opinion. But if 
this contact is enriched, as President Clinton says, by 
different group meetings -- we must agree at what level we 
begin, although we have suggestions -- I think it will be 
easier to understand each other. The presidents then will reach 
more constructive conclusions. This was what dominated our 
talks, together with the issue of relations between Mercosur 
[Common Market of the South] and NAFTA, which President Clinton 
is following carefully. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["First Special Program" sponsored by the Latin American </F>
Institute of Advanced Studies (ILDEA) and the Media Committee 
for Presidential Debates featuring statements by six Panamanian 
presidential candidates and moderated by ILDEA Director Rodrigo 
Eisenmann in Panama City; date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Eisenmann] [passage omitted] This evening our 
first speaker will be Jose Salvador Munoz, candidate of the 
Panamenist Doctrinaire Party [PPD]. [passage omitted] 
  [Munoz] [passage omitted] The PPD is a new party that has no 
connections to any previous or current governments. We are 
going to change the country politically and socially. States 
that control their economic systems are more likely in the 
long-term to create more problems than they resolve. This is 
best exemplified by the defunct Soviet Union, although our 
country is also a good example. 
  We all witnessed the statism that was in place over the past 
two decades. Panama, because of its history, nature, and 
geography, has had an economy different from that of other 
countries. The only way we can continue growing is by meeting 
our needs and by looking after the welfare of our citizens, and 
not by trying to satisfy or accept the demands imposed by other 
nations. The size of our bureaucracy must be reduced as much as 
possible to eliminate positions that have redundant duties and 
to prevent bureaucratic delays. 
  In the long-term, the only way to improve the standard of 
living for the Panamanian people is by way of education, which 
must include diverse disciplines, such as the humanities, arts, 
technology, and science. In the short-term, the only way to 
improve living standards is by creating jobs immediately, and 
this is best done via state investment. State investment 
generates a great deal of manual labor and jobs. 
  Our platform on the Panama Canal, military bases, foreign 
debt, agriculture, transportation, justice, and other issues 
will be discussed at the forums to which we have been invited. 
We will attend all of these, except those that may be 
manipulated to promote a particular candidate. Panamanians are 
the only ones that will decide who the winner will be on 8 May. 
Thank you very much. 
  [Eisenmann] Our next speaker will be Samuel Lewis Galindo, 
candidate for the Solidarity Party [PS] and the National Unity 
Mission [MUN]. [passage omitted] 
  [Lewis Galindo] Good evening, fellow Panamanians. 
Panamanians are facing a difficult crossroads. PS and MUN have 
shown the country a comprehensive development plan that proposes 
the modernization of all organizations of the Panamanian state. 
This program proposes the government's decentralization, 
granting broad and true authority to the governors in order that 
they become the foremost authorities in the provinces. We also 
will give honest assistance to corregimiento representatives, 
because they are more aware of the needs of the people in 
low-income areas. 
  Our comprehensive development plan also touches on the 
administrative career. Public employees must have the same 
guarantees, security, and incentives that private sector workers 
do thanks to the union bargaining agreements. We have proposed 
an all-out war against unemployment. We have talked about and 
continue to uphold the need to have an emergency plan that gives 
immediate jobs to 50,000 Panamanians. These 50,000 Panamanians 
would be recruited directly from low-income areas. In this way, 
we would be tackling the social problem and the unemployment 
problem. 
  We are basing our foreign policy on one word -- dignity. We 
cannot permit ourselves to move from being an enclave managed by 
a foreign power -- in this case, the United States -- to an 
enclave currently managed by an elite that caters solely to 
self-interests. The profits generated by the canal and its 
bordering areas must benefit all Panamanians. We are not going 
to create two different castes on our own territory. Canal 
revenues must be invested mainly in education, which constitutes 
the best investment the Panamanian Government can make. 
  All of these plans can only be implemented if there is a 
national consensus. We do not foster hatred, engage in 
fruitless disputes, or have a past of which we are ashamed. 
Having said this, I believe we can implement these plans with 
Panama's militant forces, such as the unions, farmers, teachers, 
nurses, and all others who believe they have a civic duty to 
support a program such as ours. I ask them: Can others carry 
out these plans? Can others who speak and promote hatred rather 
than unity among Panamanians achieve these goals we have 
presented? Along with my party and its candidates, I need your 
help. We need your votes. We need you to help us reach power 
to enable us to serve Panama and not to simply take advantage of 
the nation. Thank you very much and good evening. 
  [Eisenmann] We have just heard from Samuel Lewis Galindo. 
Ernesto Perez Balladares, the next candidate to speak, 
represents the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party], PALA [Labor 
Party], and Liberal Republican Party. [passage omitted] 
  [Perez Balladares] Fellow citizens, the country cannot 
continue living in the past or continue to waste its energy on 
political recrimination, revenge, persecution, or the settling 
of accounts. I have been, and I am sure I will continue to be, 
the target of insults and slander. Nevertheless, this will not 
make me turn away from the path I have chosen. No matter how 
many provocations I have to face, and no matter how frequent the 
harassment becomes, I reiterate my pledge to citizens that I 
will not permit, much less encourage, political persecution 
against today's political adversaries or the representatives of 
the current government. 
  Our proposal is designed to resolve the Panamanians' 
fundamental problem -- namely, unemployment -- with initiatives 
that do not necessarily entail state expenditures. The 
construction of infrastructure projects necessary for 
development, such as roads to bring produce to markets, as well 
as the Panama City-Colon, David-Paso Canoas, and 
Chorrera-Arraijan highways, must be joint efforts shared between 
the government and private enterprise. We already have concrete 
proposals for this. 
  I only mention this because these projects are a priority 
and 
at the same time create jobs in the short-term. Nevertheless, 
our platform is much broader. It includes training programs and 
the modernization of education to guarantee adequate training 
for the jobs of the future. It also entails the best use of the 
reverted areas of the canal in order that this wealth, which 
belongs to all of us, will benefit everyone. 
  I cannot initiate any government action without attending to 
the people's basic needs. For me it is unacceptable to have the 
government earmark more than $1 billion for the payment of debts 
to international financial organizations while not having the 
same concern in looking after the large segments of the 
population in urban and rural areas which do not have a water 
supply system, or if they do, they only have it for limited and 
unscheduled periods of time. 
  This country cannot begin the 21st century without having 
resolved such a fundamental and basic problem for the health and 
well-being of the population. I do not plan to evade 
international obligations, and I understand the course the 
economy is taking very well. Therefore, I can categorically 
state that it is possible to honor international commitments and 
at the same time deal with the people's most urgent problems. 
It is also possible to modernize the economy without leaving 
agricultural producers without protection. Economic opening must 
be carried out gradually by discussing national interests and 
applying clear and specific regulations. 
  In addition to training programs for the future, a coherent 
and comprehensive government plan should include immediate 
initiatives to prevent young people from becoming victims of 
vice, worsening the already worrisome problem of family 
disintegration. A single institution should centralize efforts 
to promote sports, develop cultural programs, and foster family 
values among young people. 
  If we are going to directly attack the generalized 
corruption 
we are experiencing today, there must be exemplary and harsh 
punishment for the guilty. Nevertheless, we must also invest in 
the comprehensive upbringing of the men and women of the future. 
In the same way that drug trafficking is combated in the 
streets and in the ports, we have to adopt heroic measures to 
prevent money laundering in all of its forms, especially within 
the Colon Free Zone and within the financial system, because the 
very existence of those sources of employment and wealth depend 
on the decisions we make to clean up these areas. 
  We are also concerned about the lack of security that 
worries 
every sector of society. The Panamanian people have ended up 
being frightened men and women because we always feel threatened 
by the possibility of being robbed, kidnapped, raped, or 
murdered. We plan to return security to everyone, not because 
it is a requirement for investment, but because it is an 
inalienable right of all Panamanians. 
  Our decision not to stir up the past does not mean we will 
not try to correct the injustices that have been committed. One 
of them, if not the main one, is the infamy of increasing the 
retirement age for men and women. With a little more 
creativity, with greater leeway in negotiating, and, most of 
all, with more social sensitivity, the retirement age problem 
can be studied more thoroughly and better solutions can be 
sought. 
  Fellow citizens, I foresee better days for the country. Our 
commitment to democracy means there will not be a return to 
authoritarian forms of power or to practices incompatible with 
respect for human rights. To what we do indeed have to return 
to, and return to soon, is a government that leads the country 
by way of consulting the people, not at the time of elections, 
but when decisions are made. 
  [Eisenmann] The next candidate who will speak is Ruben 
Blades, candidate of the Papa Egoro Movement. [passage omitted] 
  [Blades] For 90 years of republican life, the nation's 
political parties have failed in the task of resolving the 
Panamanian nation's fundamental problems. Papa Egoro, which was 
born as an independent movement, made the decision to become a 
political party to legalize its participation in the electoral 
process which will end on 8 May. Our objective is to reach 
government to govern with responsibility and correctly manage 
our country. This is what makes us different from the other 
political parties. They have not governed and do not want to 
govern. They want to reach power to repeat what they have 
always done. The traditional political parties are no different 
from one another. The results of their experience in the 
government clearly shows this. All of them are part of the 
failure to which they led the country's public administration 
today and yesterday. 
  The only way to fulfill our principles and objectives for 
the 
country is to continue being independent. We continue to be 
free of ties to the present and past petty politicking, and, 
above all, we have no hatreds, selfish ambitions, or desire for 
revenge, which are the things that prevent true national 
reconciliation. National reconciliation is the only thing that 
can guarantee that all Panamanians have the opportunity to work 
as a great national team for a better future. 
  The system of petty politics that prevails in the country 
wants you to believe that our project is impossible because we 
are a new party. It wants you to believe that the only thing 
that is important is to have the so-called political experience. 
It only wants you to believe that decency is madness and that 
the existing corruption is the product of involuntary mistakes, 
as if the act of governing were a game without referees or 
penalties and where one can cheat. They want you to believe 
that in these elections we can only choose between two options 
of the past, both of which have failed. 
  The Papa Egoro Movement has not been created to replace a 
government with another. It has been created because the 
country needs and wants to change the way that things have been 
done so far. We propose concerted efforts in the national 
interest and the participation of the best men and women from 
all parties and leanings to form an honest and capable 
administrative team unprecedented in Panama. The Papa Egoro 
Movement offers itself as common ground where all Panamanians 
can sow the seed of national hope and see the growth of the tree 
that will shelter all of us with prosperity, health, and 
confidence in the future of our mother earth. This is possible 
because the Papa Egoro Movement does not owe its existence to 
any special group. The Papa Egoro Movement does not have to pay 
any political debts, nor does it owe positions or privileges to 
anyone because of financial support. This is what makes a party 
truly independent. 
  Do you know the real responsibility we face in the 1994 
elections? We need to change the reality of a country that is 
used to voting against something or someone and not in favor of 
good proposals. Unfortunately, in our country the presidents 
have been generally elected as an act of choosing a lesser evil 
rather than choosing the best. Let us not commit the same 
mistake. 
  Finally, remember you will not only be voting for a 
president. Each vice president is a possible president and, 
therefore, will govern and publicly represent the majesty of the 
country. In this sense, we must carefully study what each 
presidential slate offers. Do you know who are the vice 
presidential candidates of the various parties? Do they 
adequately represent the capacity, honesty, sincerity, and 
dedication to work for all Panamanians? Do they represent a new 
image that will enable our country to again be credible and that 
will make us confident and proud of ourselves? The country can 
speak with pride about Fernando Manfredo and Ricardo Bermudez, 
who form part of our work team. 
  People, our intention is pure, our effort is sincere, and 
our 
dedication is absolute. The Papa Egoro Movement represents the 
possibility of victory of decency and true civic spirit. Papa 
Egoro really represents everyone's victory. Thank you very much. 
  [Eisenmann] We just heard from Ruben Blades. Now Eduardo 
Vallarino, presidential candidate for the Christian Democratic 
Party, will take the floor. [passage omitted] 
  [Vallarino] [passage omitted] Our government plan is founded 
on the firm conviction that the single most important asset a 
country can have is its people, and only by giving them the best 
possible opportunities can sustained and sustainable development 
be achieved. Under our government plan, creating jobs is a top 
priority to halt the family disintegration process that 
unemployment entails. It is the private sector, however, that 
can and must provide the most and best job opportunities. This 
requires a more competent government economic policy and 
improvements to Panama's current judicial stability image. 
Therefore, these two issues are priorities. High employment and 
progress rates are sustainable only if we have a healthy 
population. Therefore, health and malnutrition are also priority 
matters. [passage omitted]. 
  We submit that health investment, particularly preventive 
heath care, will require an even greater effort by the 
government. The number of health care centers operating 
properly must continue to increase throughout the country. A 
health plan requires a competent social security system. We 
propose the greatest possible independence for the Social 
Security Fund to isolate it from political interests. 
Furthermore, not only are we offering to restore the retirement 
benefits and ages that were changed, but we also propose to 
increase coverage in certain services through the implementation 
of an operationally independent administration. [passage omitted] 
  We are addressing the housing problem starting with the 
premise that neither the government or the private sector have 
the financial capability to balance the enormous housing deficit 
at a price accessible to the majority of Panamanians. Based on 
this, our proposal is directed at promoting self-help and loan 
programs to provide homes for the poverty stricken sector. The 
state must provide priority attention to the more acute housing 
problems to provide solutions for those living in extreme 
poverty, at a price they can pay. [passage omitted] 
  Sound preschool, elementary, and junior high school 
education 
must be made available to the greatest possible number of 
students. A significant level of participation by the private 
sector will be necessary in high school and technical education. 
[passage omitted] 
  Security for the Panama Canal requires a specialized police 
force. We do not need an army because outside threats are 
covered in the Panama Canal treaties and should be included in a 
wise foreign policy. The Panama Canal and its reverted areas are 
the single most important challenge for the new government. The 
canal administration must be isolated from partisan greed. The 
canal's work force must be protected and well compensated so the 
best Panamanians can feel secure working for the commission. The 
reverted areas are our main opportunity to really take advantage 
of our geographical position. This will only be true if we use 
it to replace and surpass the benefits we now receive from the 
U.S. military presence. [passage omitted] 
  [Eisenmann] We will now hear from Ruben Dario Carles, 
presidential candidate for the National Renewal Movement, the 
Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement, and the Civic Renewal 
Party. [passage omitted] 
  [Carles] Fellow citizens: On 8 May, we will all go to the 
polls and make a very important decision for the present and the 
future of all Panamanians. For the first time in 25 years, we 
are going to freely elect the government we want. That 
government will have the enormous responsibility of guiding our 
future and prepare us for the present challenges. What is at 
stake is far too delicate not to be taken seriously. Not only 
does the consolidation of democracy as a system of government 
depend on the decision we make, but also our well being, 
prosperity, and future, and that of our children. 
  In choosing a president, we must take into account each 
candidate's qualities as a statesman, their background, moral 
authority, government proposals, and the team he or she will 
work with to meet their goals toward a better life for all and 
particularly for our children. It is equally important to know 
each candidate's past as well as their views on the future to 
elect the best president. Neither I nor those who accompany me 
in this quest have absolutely anything to hide or fear from our 
past. It is no secret to you that any government program is 
worthless if the candidates, the work teams, and the government 
teams behind it lack the necessary personal qualities to direct 
and execute it. We have the experience, efficiency, character, 
and the personal will and honesty that the nation demands of its 
president. The people can rest assured that the proposed 
government plan will in fact be completed. 
  Our civic and democratic convictions explain why we were 
never repressed during the 21 years of the military dictatorship 
this country endured. We never collaborated with generals, 
colonels, or lieutenants. I, along with my compatriots, 
experienced exile and was stripped of my civil rights. The 
seriousness of our government programs assures us sufficient 
national and international trust to attract investments. Without 
such investment there will not be enough new jobs to improve the 
quality of life of all Panamanian families within the urgent 
timeframe we require. 
  My friends, job and housing shortages, limited public 
transportation service, the absence of urban sanitation, the 
deficiencies in basic services such as health, education, social 
security, water, power, and the administration of justice are 
problems that cry out for immediate solutions, decisions, and 
investment. We will maintain the present number of jobs in the 
agricultural and livestock sector by controlling basic products, 
specifically meat, milk, rice, sorghum, corn, beans, potatoes, 
and onions. We will do so in an effort to find efficient and 
reasonable costs for the farmers and fair prices for the 
consumer. 
  There is no need to tell you how important the public force 
issue is for all of us. We guarantee that it will be directed 
and led by civilians. We will also protect the environment and 
create thousands of jobs in programs and plans dealing with the 
reforestation of the country. We will sponsor tourism and 
ecological tourism as well as processing zones for exports and 
centers for the transshipment of merchandise. We must solve the 
foreign public debt but we must seek options that protect the 
interests of the majority of the Panamanians first of all. 
  You know that only serious decisions and specific and 
realistic investments will allow us to create jobs, build 
houses, equip the public transportation, improve education, and 
protect our existing services infrastructure, including the 
financial system, the regime of anonymous societies, and the 
Colon Free Zone. Decision, leadership, investment, more 
efficiency and honesty in the public administration sector, plus 
a constant struggle against corruption, impunity, drug 
trafficking, and money laundering is virtually all the country 
needs. [passage omitted] 
  [Eisenmann] Everyone knows all the candidates were invited 
to 
participate this evening. Mrs. Mireya de Gruber declined our 
invitation. Dear viewers and listeners, we hope you will tune in 
on Monday, 28 March, when we will present the first televised 
presidential debate in Panama's political history. It will be 
broadcast in national radio and television network. On behalf of 
ILDEA and the media committee for presidential debates, have a 
good evening.

  [Text] Quito, 14 Mar (EFE) -- Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori supports the candidacy of his Colombian counterpart 
Cesar Gaviria for OAS secretary general because he always bets 
"on a winner." 
  In an interview published today in the Ecuadoran newspaper 
EL 
TELEGRAFO, Fujimori said: "We are promoting this candidacy. I 
bet on a winner and I hope Cesar Gaviria will win." 
  The Peruvian president added: "I have always been very clear 
on this issue. We have expressed our clear position of total 
support for President Gaviria." 
  Fujimori announced that his government is negotiating Peru's 
reintegration into the Andean Pact, which it abandoned in 1992. 
The Andean Pact comprises Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and 
Ecuador. 
  Fujimori added: "This is a period of transition, of 
readjustment. I am sure the Andean Pact will continue and be 
strengthened with the reintegration of Peru." 
  The Peruvian president noted that he is not campaigning for 
reelection. 
  Fujimori said: "I do not want to talk about becoming a 
candidate. Of course, the (new) Constitution invites me, the 
people have invited me, but I have yet to decide."

<F P=106> [Report by the judicial editorial staff] </F>
  [Text] Although high-ranking government spokesmen, the 
Cuban Embassy in Santa Fe de Bogota, and Ricardo Santamaria, 
Colombian ambassador to Cuba, said yesterday they had no 
information about a meeting between Colombian guerrilla members 
and church spokesmen in Havana, EL TIEMPO was able to obtain new 
and more revealing details thanks to the island's authorities. 
  The meeting between the Colombian Catholic Church bishop and 
FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] commanders and 
spokesmen of the Francisco Caraballo Group and the ELN [Army of 
National Liberation] was scheduled for 1900 on 26 January, 
assistants to the meeting and state security spokesmen have told 
EL TIEMPO. 
  The meeting was held in building T-2, Zone 7, eastern 
Havana, 
and ended after 0100. It was attended by Ivan Marquez, Alfonso 
Cano, and Alberto Gutierrez Bermudez on behalf of the FARC; 
Leonel Pardo, on behalf of the Francisco Caraballo dissidents; a 
labor leader and a rank and file church activist who identified 
themselves as ELN spokesmen; and the controversial Colombian 
bishop. 
  Marquez arrived in Cuba via Cancun accompanied by a man 
surnamed Velasquez, who claimed he is a leader of the Zapatista 
National Liberation Army [EZLN] in Mexico and one of the EZLN's 
activists with close ties to the newspaper EL PREGON. 
  Moreover, Alfonso Cano had arrived in Havana on 25 January 
aboard a Viasa, the Venezuelan airline, airplane. Several 
witnesses saw him in the airplane, "but I do not know if he 
boarded in Caracas or if he came in transit from Buenos Aires," 
one of them has said. 
  Gutierrez Bermudez, an FARC activist charged with 
coordinating operations in the Magdalena Medio area, had arrived 
in Cuba several weeks earlier, reportedly to organize the 
meeting. 
  The labor leader and the rank and file church activist, who 
later identified gvthemselves as ELN spokesmen and 
representatives, left Santa Fe de Bogota on 22 January aboard a 
Cubana de Aviacion flight. 
  The main topics reviewed during the meeting between the 
prelate and the guerrilla spokesmen are well known by the 
country: They reiterated the bilateral character of the 
conflict, the need for a joint truce, and the need to sponsor 
regional dialogues with the government. 
  Altogether, 31 Colombians--including Communist Party members 
and spokesmen of labor unions and facade movements that are 
charged with comprising the FARC and ELN urban intelligence 
network--left for Havana. 
  They had been invited to participate, between 23 and 28 
January, in the "Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Congress 
for Our People's Solidarity, Sovereignty, Self-determination, 
and Life." 
  The topics for the meeting were the situation in Latin 
America; the popular forces' new tendencies for the construction 
of new democratic alternatives; the foreign debt as an 
instrument of infiltration and domination; the United States' 
economic policy toward Latin America and the Caribbean; and new 
forms of mechanisms for infiltration and domination, among 
others. 
  Other topics included th lack of an effective democracy for 
the peoples; U.S. policies on the threshold of the 21st century, 
and hemispheric influence within its permanent goals of world 
domination. 
  "This was a facade meeting, because it was actually a 
Colombian guerrilla group summit and a prolongation of the Sao 
Paulo Forum," a source has said. 
  According to other sources, the Sao Paulo meeting is a forum 
that has been held four times (Quito, Santa Fe de Bogota, Sao 
Paulo, and Havana), and it was always attended by spokesmen of 
the most radical leftist organizations in Latin America. This 
time the forum was used by the Colombian guerrilla groups to 
identify themselves and distribute their manifestos. 
  "The Colombian participants' election was so secret each 
person's passport was photocopied beforehand to guarantee an 
adequate selection. We were not given a visa, only a special 
invitation card so there would be no record in the passport," 
explained another source consulted by EL TIEMPO. 
  Another source has said: "Secrecy was necessary, because not 
everyone who attended the Latin American meeting was elected to 
participate in the private meetings." 
  "In fact, the bishop did not participate in the Latin 
American meeting, only in the other meetings." 
  EL TIEMPO was able to learn two private meetings were held: 
one, the summit held in Eastern Havana between spokesmen of the 
Simon Bolivar National Guerrilla Coordinating Board and the 
church prelate. The other one was an extension of the Sao Paulo 
forum. 
  The Sao Paulo forum was the main reason for the meeting, 
aside from the summit. 
  The forum was held on Saturday and Sunday once the Latin 
American meeting had concluded. The Colombian prelate was the 
guest of honor and, according to the sources, Fidel Castro's 
Government actively participated in it. 
  One of the sources has said: "It was an extension of the Sao 
Paulo Forum. The Mexican surnamed Velasquez identified himself 
as an EZLN activist, and the Peruvian whose surname is Castillo 
said he was Shining Path's political organization secretary. [no 
closing quotation mark as published] 
  "That is where the FARC leaders, the labor spokesman, and 
the 
rank and file church activist who claimed he was an ELN member 
identified themselves." 
  Another participant revealed to EL TIEMPO yesterday 
Gutierrez, Pardo, and the ELN activists were the ones who 
distributed a pamphlet entitled "Political Declaration of Our 
VII Summit: Simon Bolivar Guerrilla Coordinating Board" once 
the summit had ended. 
  What did the proclamation say? Signed by the FARC, the ELN, 
and the Caraballo Group, the one-and-a-half page document read: 
"The national security doctrine, an arrogant Presidency, and an 
aggressive militarism still comprise the state's backbone with 
the 1991 Constitution...." 
  "We state our solidarity with the heroical Cuban people in 
their struggle against imperialism, their defense of socialism, 
and the homeland's dignity...." (See annex) 
  Editor's note: EL TIEMPO tried many times yesterday to 
contact the prelate who attended the meeting, but he could not 
be located, so his name is omitted in this edition.

  [Text] The new Congress will be installed on 20 July. One 
significant development is that the country has returned to a 
two-party system. The results of yesterday's elections were 
very similar to those of 1991. In the Senate, the Liberal Party 
retained 59 percent of the seats, and the Conservative Party won 
28 percent. The supraparty system fared poorly, with the virtual 
disappearance of the AD-M-19 [19 April Movement Democratic 
Alliance] and the National Salvation Party. Christian movements 
received 5 percent of the seats, enhancing their importance in 
the Senate. The democratic left, in almost all its forms, is 
headed for extinction. As for the Chamber of Representatives, 
Liberals retained 55 percent of the seats, and Conservatives 
picked up the 7 percentage points lost by the AD/M-19. 
  In effect, nothing is new, and we can expect the usual from 
Congress as the degree of changes seems to have been minimal.

  [Text] The agriculture ministers of Brazil, Paraguay, 
Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay -- Sinval Guazelli, Raul Torres, 
Felipe Sola, Juan Figueroa, and Pedro Saravia, respectively -- 
on 24 February held the sixth ministerial meeting of Conasur 
[Southern Cone Consultative Council for Cooperation in the Farm 
Sector] and the fourth meeting of the Animal and Plant Health 
Committee (Cosave). 
  During the deliberations, which were held at the Uruguayan 
Mercantile Chamber of Products headquarters, the ministers 
worked on coordination of matters linked with farm policies, 
production, and commerce. 
  Figueroa said that "there was some turbulence because of 
delays in the integration movement," adding that this caused a 
delay in the meetings of top agricultural officials. This 
meeting, he went on, is particularly significant because 
technicians and ministers "have reached total consensus on the 
health agreement for the exchange of animals and farm products." 
  Figueroa emphasized the "great importance" of the agreement 
that was reached for Southern Cone countries because of the 
progress involved in the harmonization of sanitary policies by 
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Chile, and Uruguay. The ministers 
also pointed to the need to impose tighter controls on the 
admission of subsidized products to the region. 
  The resolution by the five ministers confirms the 
methodology 
used for "harmonizing health procedures to facilitate the 
international commerce of animals and farm products in Conasur 
countries." 
  The resolution sets forth that "health conditions" will be 
imposed for the admission of cattle and farm products in 
commerce between Conasur countries and with third countries. The 
document approved by the ministers states that the objective is 
to preserve animal health conditions in the region and each 
country. 
  The priorities picked up by the Regional Animal Health 
Committee (Coresa) also were ratified. The priorities seek to 
harmonize, strengthen, and improve an emergency system for 
high-risk disease. 
  Among other decisions made on 24 February is the adoption of 
"new techniques" that will regulate the exchange of farm, fish, 
and industrial products. Among such products are crude sugar, 
fresh fish, canned fish, canned tuna, UHT [ultrahigh 
temperature] milk, butter oil or anhydrous milk grease, yogurt, 
packing material, food processing equipment, cream, and cheese. 
  Figueroa emphasized that Conasur is a clearly operational 
organization in light of the "relative success" of the Uruguay 
Round of GATT talks, noting that the strengthening of 
international trade is based on regional agreements, which are 
"a powerful lever for promoting this wealth-generating activity." 
  He said the process through which the region is going gives 
rise to "new problems that we must resolve. The fact that we 
negotiate on friendly terms creates fraternal ties between 
countries, and matters that previously were difficult to analyze 
and resolve -- the foreign ministries had to intervene -- are 
today rapidly solved with a phone call."

  [Excerpt] The CPT [Permanent Workers' Council] presented 
six points to President-elect Jose Figueres and Labor 
Minister-designate Farid Ayales. The national union leadership 
met with them for the first time in (Sitrosimec). 
  In an atmosphere of cordiality, open-mindedness, and defined 
visions looking at national interest issues, the CPT presented 
to President-elect Figueres six points that are very important 
to Costa Rican workers. 
  CPT Coordinator Gerardo Chavez said that among the key 
points 
the labor movement presented to Figueres are: a salary policy 
for the next four years, respect for the right to strike, 
approval of the unemployment [cesantia] law, and granting of 
labor rights to private sector workers. Chavez also urged them 
to honor the country's commitments with other governments. 
  The workers requested the establishment of specific 
guidelines on the free trade treaty [not further specified], 
state modernization, and how the social and economic life of 
Costa Ricans will change in the next four years. 
  President-elect Figueres said that the views of the labor 
sector will be taken into account. He added, however, that no 
decision will be made for the time being, because the new 
government will not be in office until 8 May. 
  Meanwhile, Labor Minister-designate Ayales said that these 
points deal with issues that are of interest to all Costa Ricans 
and added that they are willing to hold talks to settle specific 
problems that might come up in the future. [passage omitted]

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Costa Rican economic developments monitored through 
15 March. 
  In the past months, the Treasury Ministry has maintained an 
aggressive policy in placing government bonds on the financial 
market. The debt financed by bonds in 1993 was 33 percent higher 
than in 1992. The high interest rates of the bonds have forced 
banks to pay higher rates, therefore loan costs also increase. 
This is bad for investment and production. (San Jose LA NACION 
in Spanish 28 Feb 94 p 39A) 
  According to the treasury minister, although the fiscal 
deficit reached 5 billion colones in January, at the end of the 
year, it should not be higher than 25 billion, which represents 
2 percent of the GDP. The rise in the January deficit was 
because of reduced tax collection, increased salaries in the 
public sector, and $7 million paid toward the Paris Club debt.

<F P=106> [From the "Up to Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani today assured people 
that the charges made by opposition political parties regarding 
possible technical fraud during the 20 March elections only seek 
to mar the electoral process. 
  The ghost of possible fraud continues to hover in the 
atmosphere a few days before the elections take place. 
Nevertheless, this was ruled out today by President Cristiani 
who assured us there is no basis for fraud charges, rather these 
charges are generated by groups that foresee a negative result 
in the elections. 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] In my opinion, this is a totally 
wrong strategy that seeks to mar an electoral process that has 
been open and has complied with everything. With regard to the 
UN remarks, I believe these are simple excuses given what the 
results could be. [end recording] 
  As far as the problem reported by the FMLN [Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front] on the transfer of voting places in 
several hamlets in the Chalatenango Department, President 
Cristiani said that the highest electoral institution was clear 
that this action is not intended to adversely harm or [word 
indistinct] any particular political party. 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] As has been explained, in four 
Chalatenango municipalities the population resides in the 
department's capital city -- at the seat in Chalatenango. More 
people would have to travel if the voting takes place in the 
municipalities than would have to travel from the municipalities 
to Chalatenango given that the voting document indicates the 
voting place. [end recording] 
  Cristiani told the media that the people should feel assured 
because there will be 900 Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] 
observers and approximately 3,000 independent observers, who in 
his opinion will be the witnesses to the election's transparency.

  [Text] Venezuelan Enrique Ter Horst was confirmed today by 
the UN Security Council as the UN representative and chief of 
the UN Observers for El Salvador [Onusal] mission which will 
have to take charge of the pending matters following the 
elections. UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said that 
it will be necessary to extend Onusal's mission after 31 May 
when its mandate concludes. This is before the inauguration of 
the government elected during the 20 March elections as there is 
no prospect that by that date the peace agreements will be met. 
  UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali made reference to the 
Salvadoran situation barely one week before the end of the 
electoral process indicating that although there have been some 
difficulties due to the delay in the delivery of voting 
documents in former conflict ridden areas, Onusal is negotiating 
with the authorities on the solution of this problem.

  [Text] Supreme Court President Mauricio Gutierrez Castro 
today accused Justice Minister Rene Hernandez Valiente and 
Nelson Segovia, the director of Salvadoran Legal Studies, of 
playing into the hands of the U.S. Embassy, which, according to 
Gutierrez, seeks judicial reforms even though they violate the 
nation's sovereignty. 
  [Begin Gutierrez Castro] I will be very satisfied no matter 
who becomes president of the [Supreme] Court as long as that 
court president serves the country and not a foreign nation. 
[end recording] 
  According to the Supreme Court president, Hernandez Valiente 
and Nelson Segovia are at the service of the U.S. Government 
which seeks major reforms to the judicial system. Reforms, such 
as those to the penal codes, remarked Justice Gutierrez, have 
been criticized by nationals as the nation's autonomy is lost. 
This harms the nation, the justice noted. 
  [Begin Gutierrez Castro recording] Mr. Segovia makes up part 
of the group of attorneys linked none other than to the nation's 
financial sector; besides, he has extremely good relations with 
the U.S. Embassy in our country. Now as far as Mr. Rene 
Hernandez Valiente is concerned, there is nothing more to say. 
His work has been limited to implementing the laws paid for by 
the U.S. Government. [end recording] 
  Mr. Gutierrez Castro is currently seeking to be reelected as 
a Supreme Court magistrate. He noted that his candidacy is in 
response to attorneys' support, but most of all because [words 
indistinct] judicial system's independence could be lost. 
  [Begin Gutierrez Castro recording] I feel that the Judicial 
Branch's independence is in danger; this is why I am running. 
It is not simply to seek reelection. This could or could not 
happen. [end recording] 
  The Supreme Court president once again received 
demonstrations of support for his reelection by the BAR 
association in Ahuachapan Department. On 12 March, more than 
2,000 attorneys will participate in elections to choose the 42 
candidates for justices.

  [Text] Tomorrow in Jamaica, experts from 38 Caribbean Basin 
countries will begin forming an integration organization that 
intends to create a free-trade zone in the area. This will 
include Cuba, the organizers of the forum announced. The work 
group will discuss, in Kingston, Jamaica, the document 
structuring the planned association of Caribbean nations, the 
first of its kind and one that will include all the area's 
countries. 
  The organization will bring together the nations of the 
Caribbean Basin or those with a Caribbean coast, to form a bloc 
of nations ranging from small, agriculture-exporting nations to 
countries such as Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. It will be a 
conglomerate of 205 million inhabitants, with a joint gross 
national product of $6 billion and a commercial flow of $2 
billion a year.

  [Text] The foreign ministers of Cuba and Cambodia today 
reaffirmed the profound ties of friendship between their two 
countries and spoke in favor of expanding ties of cooperation in 
all spheres where it may be possible to do so, especially 
economics. 
  During the official talks, Prince Norodom Sirivut, younger 
brother of King Norodom Sihanouk, reiterated that ties of 
friendship unite Cambodia with Cuba. The premier [title as 
heard] also emphasized his government's unalterable position 
that condemns the economic, trade, and financial embargo imposed 
on Cuba by the United States for over 30 years. 
  Robaina expressed satisfaction at finding himself in a 
Cambodia that is right in the middle of a process of national 
reconciliation and that is busy rebuilding the country, 
supported by the new climate of political stability achieved 
already last year.

  [Text] Five groups of members of the third U.S.-Cuban 
Caravan of Friendship are visiting several Cuban provinces. At 
1030 this morning, 31 members of the caravan, including the 
Reverend Lucius Walker, arrived in Santiago de Cuba. Their 
arrival was welcomed in this way [cheers heard in background] 
and it couldn't have been any different. 
  For the first time, caravan members are visiting several 
provinces. According to the Rev. Walker, the group had to be 
divided. He said that everyone wanted to visit Santiago de Cuba. 
  [Begin Walker recording, in English with superimposed 
translation into Spanish] We had a little revolution among us, 
and of course we won; therefore, it is our privilege to be here 
with you. [end recording] 
  Speaking on behalf of Cuba, Politburo member Esteban Lazo 
Hernandez said: 
  [Begin Lazo recording] We embrace you wholeheartedly and 
greet you on behalf of all the people of Santiago de Cuba. [end 
recording] 
  Jose Marti's mausoleum was the first place they visited, but 
the historical heritage and a cemetery like this have prompted a 
longer visit. They also toured several parts of the city: 
Antonio Maceo Revolution Square, then Cespedes Park. A group of 
citizens who were aware of their visit was waiting for them. 
[cheers and shouts] 
  At the municipal government building, Mayor (Luis Estruch) 
welcomed Walker, who received the city's coat of arms on behalf 
of the group. In the afternoon, the Siboney minifarm and the 26 
de Julio school were included in their agenda. 
  This caravan will be in Santiago de Cuba until next 
Wednesday. For a province with so many things to show, the 
agenda is rather tight and cannot be extended because of the 
tiring trip. Members of the caravan said, however, that they had 
rested sufficiently on the first day to continue.

  [Text] With the slightest advantage over the eastern 
provinces, the nation's central provinces achieved the best 
performance in sugarcane harvest and recovery tasks in the first 
10 days of March. This was reported at the meeting held in 
Bayamo to check the progress of that economic sphere. Central 
Cuba's sugar agroindustrial complexes obtained superior results 
in yield, base 96 [not further identified], and in reducing 
electrical energy consumption, while they tied with those of the 
east in recovery and amount of sugar produced. 
  The agroindustrial complexes of western Cuba headed sugar 
recovery, making the best use of installed capabilities and cane 
planting. 
  The progress check for the first 10 days of the harvest in 
March, which was held in Bayamo, Granma Province, was presided 
over by Nelson Torres, minister of the Sugar Industry, and Jose 
Naranjo, chief of the team for coordination and support of the 
commander in chief.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on criminal activity and related judicial 
actions in Cuba carried on Havana radio and television in 
Spanish between 26 February and 9 March. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 26 February reports that the 
Havana National Revolutionary Police arrested members of two 
gangs, most in their teens, who had been stealing from homes and 
stores in Nuevo Vedado and Alamar. These individuals comprised 
three organized groups of thieves who stole bicycles and other 
items. Before entering a house they observed it to determine the 
residents' goods and schedules. They operated mainly at dawn 
while the inhabitants slept. Most of the stolen bicycles have 
been recovered by the police. 
  Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 28 February reports on arrests 
in connection with 32,000 liters of milk, worth over 8,000 pesos 
at the official price, missing from the Beatriz milk 
pasteurizing plant which belongs to the Havana City Metropolitan 
Milk Products Enterprise in Arroyo Naranjo Municipality. At 
least nine persons benefited from this illegal activity: the 
head of the distribution and sales department, an accountant, an 
office worker, and a driver from the factory and two clerks and 
three administrators from milk distribution points in Diez de 
Octubre Municipality. They admitted to having falsified 
distribution documents in complicity with the employees of the 
milk-selling units. "In their confessions, those incriminated 
said they sold the milk at prices far higher than those set by 
the laws of the state." "This crime shows the lack of scruples 
of the accused, who stole milk earmarked mainly for feeding 
children solely so they could enjoy a living standard far higher 
than their real possibilities. At the present, when the state is 
employing important resources to guarantee the population's food 
supply, in our society there still exist people who, to satisfy 
their appetites for material goods, are capable of stealing 
foods earmarked for the population." The people involved will be 
charged with misappropriation. "According to the penal code, 
whoever appropriates state property of considerable value 
entrusted to his care will be sanctioned by a prison term of 
from eight to 20 years." 
  Cuba Vision at 0100 GMT on 2 March reports that the National 
Revolutionary Police arrested a number of people for allegedly 
stealing 12,000 kg of polypropylene from a plastics factory in 
Havana and selling it on the black market. Some of the arrested 
were employees of the factory. Over 17,000 pesos were 
confiscated from one of the arrested. 
  Radio Rebelde Network at 1255 GMT on 9 March reports a 
recent 
attempt to steal and slaughter some oxen from the Santa Maria 
Cattle Farm, a Basic Cooperative Production Unit in Holguin. All 
the thieves were caught in the act and handed over to the police.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 15 Mar (EFE) -- The German Embassy 
in Port-au-Prince today announced it will temporarily suspend 
its diplomatic presence in Haiti beginning 31 March because of 
Haiti's ongoing political crisis. This decision was made, 
according to an official communique, because the situation "does 
not allow the normal functioning of bilateral cooperation 
between the two countries." The communique adds that Germany's 
interests in Haiti will be represented after 31 March by the 
German Consulate in Miami and that German humanitarian aid will 
continue to flow through nongovernment organizations and 
churches. 
  Germany has traditional ties with Haiti and is one of the 
principal countries to offer aid to this Caribbean country. 
This aid includes the installation of hydroelectric plants over 
the past few years, as well as agricultural infrastructure 
assistance and scholarships for professionals and students. The 
Haitian-German Institute has been operating for one year in 
Port-au-Prince and offers classes in German.

  [Text] The Group of Latin American and Caribbean countries, 
Grolacc, on 14 March, expressed to the UN Security Council its 
opposition to a resolution bill that would impose a total trade 
embargo on Haiti until democracy returns to the country. 
According to diplomatic sources, Grolacc's position received the 
support of several members of the Council, notably Spain, 
Nigeria, and Djibouti. 
  In a new attempt to harmonize the efforts of the 
international community, mediator Dante Caputo invited 
representatives of the four countries, the so-called Friends of 
Haiti -- the United States, Canada, France, and Venezuela -- to 
hold a high-level meeting on the Haitian question in New York on 
17 or 18 March.

  [Text] The removal of General Cedras from the Army command 
is not sufficient for lifting the sanctions because [Lieutenant] 
Colonel Joseph Michel Francois is a torturer and can in no way 
be rewarded for his crimes, according to President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide's spokesman, Jean-Claude Martineau, on 14 March. He 
called the plan by Haitian parliamentarians anticonstitutional 
and not in compliance with the Governors Island agreement. The 
plan contains nothing but flaws, Martineau explained. 
  [Begin Martineau recording, in Creole] Another refugee boat 
sank off the Bahamas. According to the latest reports, there may 
be another 50 deaths. In Miami, Daniel Buron has been 
assassinated. The Keep-an-Eye-on-Them Organization [Veye Yo] and 
the entire community of Little Haiti in Miami are in mourning. 
In Haiti, lawbreakers are sowing death. 
  Meanwhile, a plan is moving around the streets, promising to 
resolve the crisis like a magic wand. This plan does not comply 
with the country's Constitution. In addition, it does not comply 
with the Governors Island agreement, neither in what it says, 
nor in what it means to say. Since this plan came out, people 
have been hearing comments about it from time to time, but 
nobody has asked the Haitian people -- who voted for the 
Constitution and who voted for President Aristide -- what they 
think. So we, who are speaking on behalf of the president the 
people elected, think it would be good to recenter the ball: 
  1. When Gen. Cedras signed the Governors Island agreement, 
he did it on behalf of an institution called the Army. 
  2. The international community has imposed an embargo on 
Haiti because of the coup d'etat. So the embargo cannot be 
lifted if Gen. Cedras alone goes. The coup d'etat must be 
eradicated. 
  3. Lt. Col. Michel Francois has caused the deaths of many 
people in Haiti. He is not a soldier. He is a butcher. The 
Haitian people want justice. They do not want to reward him for 
his crimes. 
  4. The constitutional president is the head of the Army 
even though he is not directly in charge of it. The Army is not 
a state within the country. 
  5. It [not further identified] is so flawed that it allows 
people to say whatever they want. We want the international 
community to keep in mind that the crisis must be resolved in 
favor of democracy, not in favor of a coup d'etat. [end 
recording]

  [Text] The legislators are trying to sell the plan for 
resolving the crisis to the population. In Jacmel, a first step 
was taken by the president of the lower chamber, Frantz Robert 
Monde, who presented the plan to the population there. He did so 
during the inauguration of an information and communication 
office for the Southeast deputies and their constituents. Our 
correspondent in Jacmel, Pierre Nazon Beauliere, filed a report: 
  [Begin Beauliere recording, in Creole] On Sunday, 13 March, 
Deputy Frantz Robert Monde, president of the Chamber of 
Deputies, inaugurated a deputies' office in Jacmel, an office 
serving as part of a transmission network between the Chamber of 
Deputies and the voters in all the constituencies. 
  Following the inauguration ceremony, Deputy Joseph Lambert 
and Frantz Robert Monde met with the population at the Samba 
Night Club for a conference-debate on the topic: analysis of the 
current political situation, the settlement plan voted by the 
deputies, and its future. Agronomist Joseph Lambert, deputy of 
Jacmel's first constituency, presented an analysis of the plan, 
then outlined the current political situation with a 
retrospective dating from 7 February 1986. The deputy assessed 
the eight years since the overthrow of Jean-Claude [Duvalier], 
during which 12 governments have come and gone, with the country 
regressing further and further. Deputy Lambert strongly 
criticized the seven months of Father Aristide's presidency. 
  The president of the House of Deputies, Frantz Robert Monde, 
presented the crisis settlement plan called the Legislators' 
Plan. Deputy Monde detailed the plan, stating that it came from 
President Aristide's laboratory and that it is not an American 
plan, as many people believe. Deputy Monde did not hesitate to 
criticize President Aristide, who he says rejected the plan 
while enjoying millions of dollars in the United States. Deputy 
Monde asserted that President Aristide never knows what he 
wants. Monde believes the entire world will soon realize that 
President Aristide does not want the crisis to be solved. Deputy 
Monde let it be known that he will not be a hostage of either 
Father Aristide or General Cedras. He stated that he is 
defending his country while being destroyed by an embargo. He 
advised that if within a month, this legislators' plan does not 
pass, they in the parliament will consider a Haitian solution 
for the crisis. 
  Senator Margaret Martin intervened to explain the reasons 
the 
senators made the decision to dismiss the office presided over 
by Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis. According to Sen. Martin, it was 
because Firmin never held a session. The Senate is blocked and 
the country is collapsing. She added that Sen. Firmin is 
spreading corruption in the Senate. She said he had offered her 
$130,000 and a diplomatic post abroad to resign. 
  Many people came to the news conference and asked questions. 
It had been a long time since the population of Jacmel had 
participated in such a conference. The population is not at all 
informed on the Haitian crisis. 
  Deputy Jose LaFrance, Rita Frederick Moncoeur, and Joseph 
Elisca Bomier attended this conference. Deputy Lambert had hired 
the band, Les Invincibles, to play in front of the building. 
Many people believe that this conference is a campaign for a 
second mandate that Deputy Joseph Lambert has begun.

  [Text] Melchor de Mencos, Peten -- As Belizean Prime 
Minister Manuel Esquivel broadens his anti-Guatemala campaign, 
Army troops of that former colony are patrolling the border area 
and warning Peten families not to enter their territory. 
  More than 3,000 Belizean soldiers are maintaining permanent 
surveillance along the alleged [supuesta] borderline. In fact, 
they built a wide highway that allows them to move easily from 
Cayo San Ignacio to Corozal, which is near the area that borders 
Peten. 
  It was reported that soldiers from the former colony 
frequently enter Peten territory and that they even harass 
peasants who have lived and worked there for many years. 
  Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel has started an 
anti-Guatemalan 
campaign and ordered the expulsion of numerous families with 
years of residence in the territories under dispute although 
many of them already filed requests before the immigration 
authorities to reside legally in Belize. 
  In order to win support within the Belizean community, 
Esquivel maintains a hostile attitude toward Guatemalans and 
points out that there could be an invasion anytime. 
  In a recent meeting with Queen of England Elizabeth II, 
Esquivel advised the sovereign on the need to maintain English 
troops in the former colony, but his efforts were unsuccessful. 
The monarch, however, assured him that the British will use the 
Belizean jungle as a training ground for some soldiers. 
  Peten authorities in Melchor de Mencos said that Guatemala 
maintains minimal surveillance along the border and this could 
facilitate new incursions by Belizean soldiers. They added that 
more than 3,000 Guatemalans have been expelled since Esquivel 
became Belizean president, although his grandparents hail from 
San Miguel, a town across from the Island of Flores. Esquivel 
also admitted that he has relatives residing in Santa Elena (a 
Peten community) but has never met them. The authorities noted 
that his hostile attitude toward Guatemalans is inexplicable.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gaspar Ilom, leader of the Guatemalan </F>
National Revolutionary Unity, URNG, by Henry Hernandez 
Marroquin; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Hernandez] Mr. Ilom, the guerrilla struggle began 
many years ago. Do the insurgents still think the same way? 
  [Ilom] I believe that first of all there was a fundamental 
decision. It was to struggle and dedicate oneself to the 
people's cause. As of that moment, it became an historic option 
and path, motivated by structural reasons in the country. It 
was not a romantic decision, but a very serious, profound, and 
delicate political decision. We had to respond to the situation 
that had existed in the country for many years when we took up 
weapons in 1962. The armed struggle is a last resort, not 
tactical or casual. 
  [Hernandez] Everything seems to indicate that there were 
options to solve problems, but perhaps you were closed to 
establishing an open dialogue? 
  [Ilom] No, history has demonstrated that political spaces 
have been totally restricted. Other times they have been 
formal, but we believe that real democracy still does not exist 
in Guatemala. 
  [Hernandez] Why didn't you negotiate from the beginning and 
not after 33 years of armed struggle? 
  [Ilom] One could say now that the conditions are right. 
Seeing what has occurred at the national and international 
level, we could say the time is right for negotiation. 
  [Hernandez] Could this represent a success or satisfaction? 
  [Ilom] Satisfactions are of a moral nature and the greatest 
is having contributed so that the people can organize, 
demonstrate, defend themselves, and struggle for their rights. 
I believe that is my greatest satisfaction, and also being able 
to participate in the people's armed struggle. 
  [Hernandez] How would you refer to the case of the millions 
killed? 
  [Ilom] War is always painful. One goes to war when there are 
supreme reasons that justify it or make it necessary. In 
Guatemala the social cost has been quite high, but the majority 
of those killed was a result of the manner and means used by the 
Army to repress and massacre entire populations. 
  [Hernandez] Did the guerrillas provoke that repression? 
  [Ilom] I believe that we seek only general objectives. In 
war there is a substantial difference. One is the military 
struggle on which we base ourselves. It could be described as a 
clean war with the painful loss of human lives. 
  Unconventional warfare is different because of the tactics 
involved. The Army, however, kidnaps, tortures, and kills, and 
that is repression. Sabotage becomes a military technique, 
recognized by any treatise writer (tratadista). We are involved 
in a unconventional war. 
  [Hernandez] There is talk of a war, in the field and 
politically. The military claim they won the first one and that 
the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] seeks to win 
the second one. How do you view this? 
  [Ilom] That is a very fanciful and absurd view. On the one 
hand, because it does not respond to reality, because the URNG 
has not been defeated, despite the fact that the Army has 
proclaimed itself the winner approximately 800 times in the past 
10 years. 
  Another mistake is to say that there is a political and 
military war. For us it is an overall form of struggle. This 
enlightens us and preserves the armed movement. These are 
affirmations by recalcitrant sectors who do not want to seek a 
peaceful solution. 
  [Hernandez] Why do you maintain a contradictory position 
and conduct terrorist acts while engaging in a peace dialogue? 
  [Ilom] Let us make one thing clear. We conduct military 
activities, not terrorist activities. As long as a cease-fire 
is not agreed upon, the URNG actions will continue. It depends 
on the Army to make a counteroffensive, although it can be 
resolved through political negotiations. Then, it is wrong to 
say that while there is dialogue there will not be war. It does 
not represent a lack of will, however. 
  [Hernandez] Don't you think the people see this as an 
inconsistency? 
  [Ilom] No. 
  [Hernandez] Why? 
  [Ilom] For us it means remaining in the struggle. What has 
not been said is that there are sectors seeking to block the 
progress in the peace talks. 
  [Hernandez] What sectors? 
  [Ilom] Both the Army and private enterprise have come out in 
that direction. 
  [Hernandez] What makes you think they are the ones, and what 
objectives do they seek? 
  [Ilom] It is clear, because they are the minority privileged 
sectors that do not want transformations that are necessary for 
the country in every respect. They want to maintain society as 
they have for the past 30 years, to maintain a counterinsurgency 
situation that has led the majority of the people to poverty. 
This is always done at the cost of the people, who must endure 
subhuman conditions. 
  [Hernandez] By blowing up bridges and electricity towers, 
are 
you directly struggling against those sectors? 
  [Ilom] Of course. We have conducted military sabotage of 
bridges and some electricity towers that specifically affect the 
large producers of the country who do not want the people to 
organize and claim their rights. In the same way, last August 
we began to charge the war tax on farms, in view of the 
intransigence of sectors that do not want the negotiations. 
  The checkpoints and highway holdups are not our actions. 
They are carried out by the military, with the aim of 
discrediting us. I would also like to explain that the latest 
incidents, such as the demolition of the San Juan River bridge 
on the way to the Atlantic was not the work of the URNG. 
  [Hernandez] Don't you stop to think that the people are the 
ones who suffer from the demolition of bridges and the lack of 
electricity? 
  [Ilom] It only causes them inconveniences. Of course, we 
would not like it to happen, but reports exaggerate how people 
are affected. They are inconvenienced by having to transfer 
from one vehicle to another and having to wait for electricity 
repairs to be made to restore service. 
  [Hernandez] Have you ever considered other methods that do 
not affect the population? 
  [Ilom] Yes, we have other alternatives such as the practice 
of the war tax. This has been selective and carried out at very 
specific political moments. 
  [Hernandez] When you speak of the war tax, how many victims 
have had to yield to your demands? 
  [Ilom] Look, I can't say how many, because many of them have 
paid their tax and they could have been affected. It is an 
important activity and we have made some tax extensions for 
humanitarian and labor reasons. 
  [Hernandez] How successful have you been? 
  [Ilom] We have been successful economically. 
  [Hernandez] Is part of the success you speak of the 
kidnapping of Franterno Vila Giron? 
  [Ilom] No, that was not done by the URNG. It is quite 
different to collect taxes from a farm than to kidnap persons. 
In this case the Army must be investigated. 
  [Hernandez] Yet the guerrillas are accused of having links 
to 
the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] to conduct 
kidnappings. 
  [Ilom] That was a baseless charge aimed at affecting the 
FMLN 
and the URNG. We have clearly said so. 
  [Hernandez] Are you going to continue with the war tax? 
  [Ilom] Until the process of negotiation concludes. We are 
only beginning and that activity has been reported at the 
international level. 
  [Hernandez] In other words, the URNG does not have economic 
resources? 
  [Ilom] Economic resources are always insufficient, but the 
URNG has been struggling for 12 [number as published] years and 
can continue to do so with or without money. It is not an 
economic problem, but rather a political one. 
  [Hernandez] There are guerrilla forces that are out of 
control. Is this so, and could it be described as a 
disintegration? 
  [Ilom] There is no force out of control in the URNG. It 
involves bandits or special Army groups who conduct 
counterinsurgency activities. 
  [Hernandez] It was reported in Europe that Commander Ilom is 
tired of the struggle and is searching for new objectives. Is 
this true? 
  [Ilom] You can say you have seen Gaspar Ilom and that he has 
the same revolutionary enthusiasm he had on the first day, only 
with 30 more years of experience. I am not tired. On the 
contrary, each day I am ready to struggle for my people in 
whatever form is necessary. 
  [Hernandez] When the URNG becomes a political party, what 
will your wishes and role be, and who among the commanders could 
be a presidential candidate? 
  [Ilom] That is not a function of the URNG. We have not 
strived for leadership, much less for any candidacy. We have a 
project that will permit the country to progress and to resolve 
an armed conflict. Then the bases can be established to resolve 
the economic, social, and political crisis. 
  [Hernandez] But for such a project, one needs to be in the 
presidency. 
  [Ilom] We are a developing political force and a real 
alternative for uniting efforts and seeking consensus.

<F P=106> [Article by Alberto Ramirez Espada] </F>
  [Text] The OAS International Human Rights Commission 
described to President Ramiro de Leon Carpio during a meeting 
held last night at the presidential palace the need for the 
withdrawal of all military detachments located in areas where 
the Communities of Resistant People (CPR) have settled. The 
meeting was held following the conclusion of an OAS visit that 
lasted several days to the areas in conflict. 
  Leo Valle Lanza, president of the international commission, 
indicated they had received reports from the CPR settlers on 
harassment by Army soldiers, mined camps, and restrictions 
placed on their movements. "It is obvious that as a result of 
the proximity of the combat areas, there could be guerrilla 
movements, but this does not necessarily imply the CPR are 
cooperating with the subversives," Valle Lanza added. 
  "The only thing they want is to be recognized as a civilian 
population and for their most basic rights to be respected," 
noted the international official who also indicated President de 
Leon Carpio had confirmed his intentions to respect those 
rights. This is why the OAS delegates consider the 
demobilization of the military detachments near the CPR a top 
priority. Nevertheless, they received Defense Minister Mario 
Rene Enriquez' assurance that no military operation are being 
carried out in those areas. 
  The international commission was made up of Valle Lanza, 
David Padilla, Elizabeth Houppert, and Osvaldo N. Kreiner. The 
commission was accompanied by Fernando Alvarez Guadamuz who 
indicated they had visited Xalbal, Cantabal, Cuarto Pueblo, San 
Francisco Los Angeles, San Luis, and La Esperanza; they also 
spoke to the soldiers of the nearby detachments.

  [Text] Yesterday, Vice President Arturo Herbruger Asturias 
denied any possibility that the government and the Army are 
planning an offensive against residents of the Communities of 
Resistant People (CPR). "The Defense Ministry has already denied 
such accusations. It clearly stated that there will not be 
unreasonable actions against them or that there will be any 
persecution," he added. 
  In paid advertisements, CPR members claim that since 10 
February, there have been "large military mobilizations" 
apparently aimed at subjecting them to military control, 
preventing them from rebuilding the Ixcan Grande Cooperative, 
and stopping more refugees from returning. 
  Herbruger noted that far from organizing acts to intimidate 
or affect these people, the government is involved in efforts to 
protect them. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Bernardo Arevalo also said the 
members of the OAS Inter-American Human Rights Commission 
(CIDH), who recently visited these communities, did not tell the 
Foreign Ministry about similar complaints. Arevalo said that in 
the letter requesting permission to visit the CPR's, the CIDH 
did not mention this as a motive and only limited itself to 
saying that it wanted to observe the reintegration of refugees 
into the communities process.

  [Text] Honduras yesterday officially signed in Geneva, 
Switzerland, the GATT membership protocol to become a 
contracting party after two years of difficult negotiations. 
  From Geneva, Economy and Commerce Minister Dalmer Urbizo 
Panting, after signing the GATT protocol, reported the ceremony 
was held in the presence of 26 GATT contracting countries. "For 
Honduras, the signing of this protocol represents a historical 
event of great importance, which concludes a long, intense, and 
sustained campaign to transform and strengthen the economy's 
external sector," Panting noted. 
  With the signing of the membership memorandum, it is now up 
to Congress to ratify Honduras' GATT membership. On 11 April, 
at the latest, the country will become a contracting party. 
  Additionally, Panting reported that he met with 
representatives of the Intellectual Property Office in Geneva, 
where techniques were established to create a similar office in 
Honduras. He added that the way in which this organization will 
cooperate with our country in different areas was analyzed in 
order to establish an adequate framework for international 
investments.

  [Text] Some 45 percent of Panamanians believe that 
[Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD, presidential candidate] 
Ernesto Perez Balladares would favor creating a new military 
force, but also believe him to be the most reliable presidential 
candidate. These results were obtained in a nationwide poll 
conducted by the CID/GALLUP firm for EL PANAMA AMERICA during 
the week of 26 February-3 March. 
  Some 23 percent of 1,218 citizens polled did not answer the 
question on the creation of a military force. Some 19 percent 
of those polled said none of the seven candidates intend to 
create a military force. For 6 percent of those polled, Ruben 
Dario Carles intends to create a military force; while Mireya 
Moscoso de Gruber and Ruben Blades got 3 percent. The other 
presidential candidates registered 1 percent. 
  Regarding the most preferred candidate, three out of every 
10 
Panamanians said they prefer Perez Balladares. Carles obtained 
22 percent, Mireya Moscoso 11 percent, Blades 10 percent, while 
Eduardo Vallarino, Samuel Lewis Galindo, and Jose Salvador Munoz 
garnered 4 percent each.

  [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, PRD [Democratic 
Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate, yesterday charged 
that a campaign is being waged by official parties to link his 
political group to acts of violence. In addition, Perez 
Balladares denied at a news conference that Argelis Chavez -- 
accused by Arnulfists of aggression -- is a PRD member. 
  The Arnulfist Party [PA] National Directorate reiterated 
that 
its presidential candidate, Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, was 
attacked in Puerto Armuelles on Saturday by a woman who had a 
PRD flag in her hands. The PA warned it will not remain passive 
in light of the mounting violence aimed at it. 
  During the PRD news conference Perez Balladares presented 
Chavez indicating she did not belong to his party, rather, she 
was registered as a member of the Christian Democratic Party 
(PDC), from which she had recently resigned. The presidential 
candidate also said that Chavez currently works with Ricardo 
Perez Colman, a PDC legislator, who confirmed her resignation. 
  During the news conference, Argelis Chavez acknowledged she 
had a stick in her hand but it was not to attack the PA 
candidate, rather it was to "whack her little brother" who had 
strayed off. 
  Perez Balladares charged there are political parties, which 
he did not identify, that are paying some individuals to carry 
PRD signs and to provoke incorrect actions to make the party 
appear violent. "We have had to carry the blame for violent 
actions that brought mourning to the nation; this still bothers 
us. Nevertheless, we have made an effort because we know that 
the country deserves better proposals," he underlined. 
  Meanwhile, Fernando Arias, from the PA, said they have been 
the victims of the attacks and that the Puerto Armuelles case 
has been confirmed by at least six persons.

  [Text] The latest CID/GALLUP poll reveals that seven out of 
10 Panamanian citizens believe that the United States must 
maintain its bases in Panama. Additionally, six out of 10 
Panamanians think that the cost of living has increased the last 
four months. The survey conducted exclusively for EL PANAMA 
AMERICA details that 69 percent of 1,218 people polled hope that 
the U.S. Southern Command remains in Panama after the year 2000, 
and 23 percent reject the U.S. presence. 
  Regarding the cost of living increase, it is mostly felt by 
40-year-old women and those with a high school education. 
Despite the cost of living increase experienced by Panamanians, 
the poll showed that 62 percent believe the country's situation 
will improve in the next two years. 
  Regarding the creation of jobs, nearly half of those 
interviewed said the government is responsible for hiring more 
people in government positions, but four out of 10 Panamanians 
think the private sector must increase its efforts to create new 
jobs. 
  The view of those polled contrasts with the objectives of 
government and international organizations economists, who think 
the state must reduce its payroll, which employs 140,000 
officials earning monthly wages totalling 69 million balboas. 
  The CID/GALLUP poll also revealed 55 percent of those polled 
prefer to work in the private sector and only 27 percent favor a 
job in the public sector.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of

  [Text] President Guillermo Endara's government has 
approved, through an Executive decree, the obligation of every 
person who enters the country to declare under oath how much 
cash or liquid assets they are bringing with them. According to 
the decree, the measure will control the entrance of fiduciary 
money, "since right now, a great many people enter the nation 
with large amounts of cash and other assets and no one knows 
their origin or destination." 
  Several weeks ago, DEA agents in the United States said 
Panama cooperated more in the fight against drug trafficking 
during Manuel Antonio Noriega's military dictatorship than the 
current democratic government. 
  According to a Presidency press bulletin, the government 
order seeks to safeguard the principles ruling the International 
Financial Center operating in Panama and to prevent the 
fraudulent entrance of ill gotten cash and other valuables. In 
this regard, the document indicates that "although our 
legislation does not prohibit the entrance and exit of cash and 
other liquid assets, it is advisable to safeguard the Panamanian 
banking center's principles. This assures that passengers 
entering the nation with cash and other assets, that the cash 
and assets have legal origins and are not the product of illegal 
drug trafficking." 
  The government said the Customs Directorate will be 
responsible for enforcing the decree as well as punishing the 
violators. Forms, therefore will be drawn up to read: 
"Traveler's Sworn Statement," in which the person, national or 
foreigner, will declare his assets. 
  Yesterday, members of the National Banking Association 
pointed out that the initiative can be healthy, but only as a 
precautionary measure as it is very difficult to prevent money 
laundering. Meanwhile, others said the measures could cause the 
number of attacks on tourists to increase as the amount of cash 
being brought in will be known.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 14 Mar (NA) -- Secretary for the 
Prevention of Drug Abuse Alberto Lestelle today said that the 
Armed Forces "should not interfere" in the antinarcotics effort 
in Argentina, because "the security organizations are 
effectively conducting this struggle." 
  Lestelle emphasized his viewpoint by comparing Argentina to 
Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, and the United States. He said 
Argentina "does not have problems as serious as theirs to 
justify the Armed Forces' participation in this struggle." 
  He also said that the Argentine Government has "fully" 
agreed 
with the United States on the need "to update Argentine laws, 
which are the legal basis for this difficult struggle." 
  Lestelle admitted, however, having received a specific 
request from Robert Gelbard, the number two man in the Drug 
Enforcement Agency [as received] in this regard, as was stated 
in an article published today in the Buenos Aires press. He 
explained that this issue has already been discussed at the 
Inter-American Commission for Drug Abuse Prevention. 
  Lestelle also asserted that there is a bill modifying the 
law 
that penalizes drug trafficking. He explained that "the only 
pending aspect of the problem is that related to informers." 
  He pointed out: "We have met with some congressmen to make 
sure that the figure of the informer is included in the law, 
thus ensuring that it includes the four elements -- the 
informer, the repentant drug trafficker, the undercover agent, 
and the court-monitored drug delivery -- and thus help justice 
to function better." 
  Lestelle favors inclusion of the "repentant drug trafficker" 
in the current laws, "as long as it has legal bases." 
  He emphasized: "With legal protection enabling the person to 
appear before the courts and report on whatever is required, 
people will act responsibly, will not flee the country, and will 
logically not be saying just any nonsense." 
  Lestelle said this was not the case of the well-known 
"repentant drug trafficker" Andy Cruz Iglesias, who told the 
Spanish judges about Argentine connections with an international 
dollar laundering gang, which was the source of the so-called 
"Yomagate" case in Argentina. 
  "The judge deemed Andy Iglesias' remarks valid, but reality 
showed that the data reported by Iglesias were not that 
correct," Lestelle said. 
  Referring to the repercussions in Argentina of Iglesias' 
testimony, Lestelle said: "It is not necessary to tell the truth 
for a scandal to arise." He added: "The required legal action 
was adopted, and the appropriate people contacted." 
  In conclusion, Lestelle rejected demonstrations in favor of 
the legalization of drug use, and warned that "the economic 
excuses used in this regard have no foundation, because to 
legalize the drug it would be necessary to produce the drug in 
the country. To do this we would have to build drug processing 
laboratories, and these would have to be controlled by the 
central government, as occurs in the case of laboratories that 
produce medicine."

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Defense Minister Oscar Camilion </F>
by Fernando Nole -- place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Nole] Minister, there were rumors this week that 
the deal with Lockheed to refurbish the Skyhawk aircraft was 
almost closed. Has the agreement been signed yet? 
  [Camilion] This agreement is almost closed. We believe all 
negotiations will be finalized in late April. The agreement 
includes the refurbishment of 36A 4M Skyhawk aircraft: 18 will 
be done in the United States and the rest in Argentina, in the 
Cordoba Materiel Area [AMC]. 
  [Nole] Can you tell us about this dual program negotiation, 
because there are many versions. 
  [Camilion] A Defense Ministry and Air Force delegation held 
talks with the Westinghouse company -- which will provide the 
celebrated radar installations -- with Pratt &amp; Whitney -- 
which 
will supply the avionics -- and with Lockheed. Talks were also 
held with the U.S. Navy to renegotiate letters of intent 
originally agreed on over the refurbishing of a significant 
number of aircraft. Third, Lockheed has begun talks with the 
U.S. Smith Industries because we want that company to 
participate in this program. And, last, talks were held by the 
Defense Ministry with the Vought company to coordinate the Pampa 
2000 aircraft project. 
  [Nole] Who will run the former aircraft factory? 
  [Camilion] The AMC property will not be transferred to 
anybody. It will be run by a group of companies that will be 
headed by Lockheed with the Air Forces' participation. 
  [Nole] There were rumors that the purchase of these aircraft 
caused concern in Chile. 
  [Camilion] I do not think the Chileans have anything to 
worry 
about. We discussed this subject at length with the former 
Chilean defense minister (Patricio Rojas). When he visited 
Argentina, he clearly said that Chile is not worried about 
Argentina buying Skyhawks and disclosed that Chile was buying 
Mirage interceptors. 
  [Nole] Over the past few days there have been rumors about 
an 
aborted sale of cannons to Liberia whose final destination was, 
in truth, Croatia. Did this triangular weapons deal exist? 
  [Camilion] No. The deal was exclusively with Liberia and was 
vetoed right from the beginning. We cannot sell anything to 
Croatia. There was a proposal to sell Pucara aircraft to 
Croatia, but it was turned down due to the international weapons 
embargo on the region. We were not aware of an embargo on 
Liberia, but the Foreign Ministry found the operation was not 
feasible because there was also a weapons embargo on that 
country. But let me make it clear that this sale was for 
Liberia and not for Croatia. 
  [Nole] Where did the rumor on the interest in sending 
weapons 
to the former Yugoslavia come from? 
  [Camilion] Those were mere speculations, although I must 
admit that I am personally interested in investigating their 
origin. 
  [Nole] What sort of investigations has your ministry started 
regarding the participation of military men with guerrilla 
elements that held up an armored vehicle on the [Buenos Aires] 
beltway. 
  [Camilion] We have obviously started an investigation and 
have been in contact with the SIDE [Army Intelligence Service]. 
This problem has worried us, we are investigating it, and what 
worries us most is a possible link between members of the Armed 
Forces with some intelligence service or criminal group. Our 
investigations are to determine if there are other connections. 
We cannot conduct more exhaustive investigations because the 
Defense Ministry cannot engage in domestic intelligence 
activities. That must be handled by the Interior Ministry and 
the Federal Police. 
  [Nole] Naturally, but it is very worrisome that members of 
the Army and of the security forces act in an organized manner 
with criminal groups. 
  [Camilion] Undoubtedly, although we believe the beltway case 
is an isolated case. We must be on the lookout to see if there 
are other connections, but we believe this was an isolated case 
and do not attribute to it -- despite the ideological mixture of 
the group -- any political implications. This is, essentially, 
a common case of delinquency. 
  [Nole] Does the fact that many servicemen work for private 
security enterprises to obtain extra money have any effect on 
the three branches of the Armed Forces? 
  [Camilion] This problem is worrying because the need for 
another job somewhat affects the Armed Forces' professional 
conduct. However, it is currently unavoidable due to the low 
salaries officers on duty earn and, consequently, this ministry 
and the Armed Forces have accept that this situation will remain 
a military reality for some time, that is, the need for the 
officers to have other jobs. 
  [Nole] Armed Forces salaries have always been a polemic and 
much discussed subject between the Defense and Economy 
Ministries. 
  [Camilion] This year's budget is considered reasonable, 
which 
does not mean the Armed Forces's salaries are satisfactory. We 
are not being subjected to any pressure or negotiations for 
salary increases for the civilian and military sectors. The 
1994 budget remains unchanged. 
  [Nole] How is your relationship with [Economy Minister 
Domingo] Cavallo? 
  [Camilion] We have always rationally explained the Defense 
Ministry's needs to the economy minister and have always 
received rational answers. First, we have systematically 
organized Defense Ministry expenditures and so far have always 
had a positive response. There is no disagreement with the 
Economy Ministry. 
  [Nole] Regarding drug trafficking, the United States seems 
to 
want to form a multinational force to fight this problem. Are 
you working on this? 
  [Camilion] Argentina has two forces to fight trafficking; 
the 
Border Police and the Naval Coast Guard. This is why the Armed 
Forces have no reason or intention of participating in the 
struggle against trafficking as happens in other countries. 
Naturally, if circumstances justify it, we may cooperate by 
granting logistic support, but we do not want the Armed Forces 
involved in the struggle against trafficking, because the three 
branches do not want this. 
  [Nole] Was there unrest within the Armed Forces over the 
arrival in Argentina of Italian prosecutors to investigate the 
disappearance of Italian citizens in our country? 
  [Camilion] Yes, there was a lot of unrest. The Armed Forces 
were deeply concerned because they believed -- rightly so in my 
opinion -- that this could mean reopening a chapter which 
Argentina considers closed. It was considered that these 
investigations would reopen cases that have already been closed 
and would mean interfering with the three branches, with the 
legislative branch over the laws it dictates, with the federal 
chamber over the rulings it hands down; and the executive branch 
over the amnesty that it ordered. This chapter is regarded as 
closed and nobody wants it reopened through indirect channels. 
  [Nole] My last question. Within the Armed Forces, are there 
any groups that favor a coup? 
  [Camilion] None at all. The Armed Forces 
institutionalization process in Argentina is comprehensive. 
There is no chance of a military coup taking place in Argentina.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 15 Mar (NA) -- Foreign Minister Guido 
Di Tella today confirmed the dispatch of Argentine troops to the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina region. He pointed out, however, that it 
still must be determined if the troops will travel from Buenos 
Aires or if some of the troops serving in Croatia will be 
transferred. 
  Therefore, Di Tella confirmed that Argentina will provide 
military cooperation in the Bosnia-Herzegovina region, accepting 
a petition made by UN Secretary General Butrus-Butrus Ghali, who 
also asked for a special $10 million financial contribution for 
the peace operation there. 
  Before opening an OAS-sponsored seminar on the security 
issue 
at the Alvear Hotel in this capital, the foreign minister 
admitted today: "We are studying if the troops deployed in 
Croatia will be transferred, new troops will travel, or a mixed 
contingent, involving these two alternatives, will be deployed." 
  For his part, Defense Minister Oscar Camilion said Argentina 
"will not be squandering money" by dispatching a 150-man 
contingent to the Bosnia region. He said: "It is a reasonable 
contribution to the peace of a country whose fate has caught the 
world's attention." 
  Thus, Camilion challenged the criticism leveled by some 
political leaders over Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella's 
compromise with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. These 
political leaders understand that there are other priority 
issues. 
  In this regard, Camilion admitted that "there are other 
pressing needs," but championed the governmental decision to 
dispatch troops to Europe's most conflictive region because "it 
represents a medium-term interest in the existence of a global 
situation of good relations." 
  The defense minister summarized: "Argentina will play a 
small role in this peace process, because there will be 
thousands of troops there and Argentina will merely contribute 
150 soldiers." 
  The Argentine compromise was established on 14 March after a 
meeting between Argentine President Carlos Menem and the UN 
secretary general, who also asked for a special financial 
contribution for the funds allocated to the peacekeeping 
operations. 
  Argentina has more than 800 troops deployed in Croatia, a 
region in the former Yugoslavia where there are virtually no 
more armed clashes. Therefore, Butrus-Ghali sought to guarantee 
Argentina's presence in Bosnia, where the United Nations plans 
to deploy between 10,000 and 15,000 Blue Helmets.

  [Text] La Paz, 13 Dec (EFE) -- Various politicians said 
today that former Bolivian President Luis Garcia Meza, who was 
detained in Brazil, could involve many of the active members of 
Bolivian politics in the actions of his de facto government 
(1980-1981) for which he was sentenced to 30 years in prison. 
  Deputy Benjamin Miguel of the Christian Democratic Party 
(PDC) said today that Garcia Meza is quite "smart to do that ... 
to try to stain with his accusations many people who now appear 
to be democrats and respectful of the Constitution but who 
encouraged the military dictatorships." 
  Garcia Meza, who was detained on 11 March by Brazilian 
police 
in Sao Paulo, said: "I am paying for the things others did and 
I will prove it." 
  Deputy Miguel, who lived in exile during the Garcia Meza 
government, said, "the former dictator has nothing to lose" and 
he will try to get the greatest political advantage from his 
declarations before and after he is extradited to Bolivia. 
  The La Paz morning daily HOY says in an editorial on 12 
March 
that there is "fear of Garcia Meza," and that "this time the 
people are not the ones who are afraid of this character, but 
his old allies and Bolivian politicians who are about to get 
another bucket of water" from the former dictator. 
  Juan del Granado, a lawyer in the civic lawsuit of the 
so-called "Trial of the Century" against Garcia Meza that lasted 
seven years, labeled the former dictator a "liar and forgetful." 
He said, however, that whatever Garcia Meza says will serve to 
open the case again against new people who were involved in the 
criminals acts committed by the former general. 
  Miguel Urioste, leader of the Free Bolivia Movement (MBL) 
that is in the government coalition, said that "the two previous 
governments protected the former dictator" in reference to 
former President Victor Paz Estenssoro (1985-1989) and Jaime Paz 
Zamora (1989-1993). The first because it let him go and the 
second because it did not want to arrest him. 
  Urioste added: "I hope Garcia Meza is man enough to accuse 
his accomplices, accessories, and protectors, and that the heads 
that must roll begin to roll." 
  The MBL announced that it will propose in the next few days 
that the Constitution, Justice, and Judicial Police Committee of 
the Chamber of Deputies investigate the protection given to 
Garcia Meza by people linked to current Bolivian politics and 
diplomacy. 
  Deputy Eduardo Paz of the opposition Conscience of the 
Fatherland (Condepa) said that all those who cooperated with the 
Garcia Meza government should be "unmasked." He supports any 
initiative to identify the former dictator's accessories during 
the five years he remained a fugitive from justice. 
  According to a "confidential" report released by the local 
FIDES news agency, more than 100 people have covered up for 
Garcia Meza in Bolivia including soldiers, congressmen, close 
friends, relatives, and people who benefited in administrative 
and political positions during the de facto government from July 
1980 to August 1981. 
  The Bolivian Supreme Court sentenced Garcia Meza on 21 April 
1993 to the stiffest sentence, 30 years in jail, for nine crimes 
of sedition, murder, malfeasance, and stealing government 
property.

<F P=106> [By Maria Helena Tachinardi] </F>
  [Text] Acting Foreign Minister Roberto Abdenur has told 
this newspaper that the Brazilian Government hopes to be able to 
announce "a formula for bolstering scientific and technological 
cooperation between the two countries," before U.S. Vice 
President Al Gore's visit to Brazil on 21 March. "It is a major 
signal from the United States," he added, without giving further 
details. 
  Itamaraty and the Science and Technology Ministry are 
working 
together on the issue. Science and Technology Minister Israel 
Vargas told this newspaper: "We may be able to reactivate the 
scientific and technological cooperation agreement between 
Brazil and the United States." The two countries signed a 
document for an extension of the agreement about three years 
ago; they could not agree to sign a new agreement because the 
United States imposed a clause that, at that time, could not be 
accepted. The clause dealt with the need to preserve 
intellectual property rights. The two countries are now having 
problems in that area. 
  Al Gore will disembark in Brasilia at around 1830 [2130 GMT] 
on 21 March. He will be coming from Buenos Aires, where he will 
open a conference on telecommunications sponsored by a United 
Nations specialized agency, the International Telecommunication 
Union. He will stay in Brasilia only until midnight on Monday, 
after fulfilling of a six-hour agenda. He is scheduled to meet 
with President Itamar Franco upon his arrival. The agenda 
includes issues like the hemispheric summit meeting, which is 
scheduled for the end of the month in Washington, an initiative 
that the Brazilian Government considers "a catalyzer of the new 
phase in the relations between the United States and Latin 
America," according to Abdenur. 
  At the U.S. Embassy, Al Gore will meet with the Brazilian 
community ("town meeting") [preceding two words in English] to 
address several matters. The idea is that Gore should meet with 
local leaders from various sectors. He will then meet with 
Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who will host a dinner in Gore's 
honor. The formal conditions of the dinner have yet to be 
established. 
  Abdenur believes Brazil-U.S. relations "are marked by an 
unprecedented level of convergence, which does not mean there 
will not be divergencies in some areas." Abdenur added that the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), among the United 
States, Mexico and Canada, reflects an "improvement in the value 
of Latin America in the eyes of the United States," because it 
opens the possibility for the future expansion of the commercial 
agreement. 
  The same day Al Gore is in Brasilia, Itamaraty will welcome 
the foreign ministers of 12 Rio Group countries and Portuguese 
President Mario Soares.

  [Text] Sao Jose dos Campos -- The Brazilian Aeronautics 
Company (Embraer) has sold the first two units of the 50-seat 
regional transport EMB-145, which is based on the [EMB-120] 
Brasilia plane. The Australian airline company Flight West, 
which intended to purchase four planes, now has decided to 
purchase two planes and place two firm options to purchase two 
more planes. The contract's cost has been estimated at $60 
million. The contract was signed by Flight West Chairman Dennis 
Buchanan. Flight West has been operating both [EMB-110] 
Bandeirante and Brasilia planes for many years. 
  The EMB-145 is Embraer's most daring project and is still in 
its development stage. The EMB-145's initial flight has been 
scheduled for April 1995. Budgeted at $300 million, this 
project has a potential $1 billion market in the next 15 years. 
Each plane is sold for $13 million. Fourteen customers from 
eight countries have confirmed 136 purchase orders.

made previously on illegal foreign financing for a Brazilian 
political party. He emphasized that he does not have any 
evidence but only a report from a "respectable" person. 
  Nevertheless, Amorim believes there actually exists money 
illegally entering Brazil to finance politicians. Reportedly, 
the financing mainly comes from Italy, but also from France, 
Germany, and even Poland. He noted that he is not aware of the 
party that reportedly benefited from this financing. If I were 
aware, Amorim said, "I would not have to ask the Italian courts 
for help." On 8 March, Amorim hinted he actually was aware of 
the party involved. He said: "It is a party that might gain 
power in October." 
  The judge denied that he had stressed that the money came 
from Mafia criminal activities or from drug trafficking 
activities. In remarks to Brazilian journalists at the Vitorio 
Mele attorney general's hall in Rome, Amorim on 10 March said: 
"I never said that." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 15 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Colombian 
Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta has ruled out a massive 
surrender by the Cali Cartel chiefs after one of the Mafia 
chiefs surrendered to justice last Saturday. The official 
considers the surrender of Julio Fabio Urdinola Grajales who 
last Saturday turned himself in to one of the representatives of 
the Office of the Prosecutor General in Palmira, some 400 km 
southwest of Bogota, to be "an isolated case." Arrieta 
reiterated: "I do not think that the most powerful members of 
the Cali Cartel are about to surrender to justice." 
  Late in 1993 the lawyers of the powerful Cali Cartel began 
to 
contact Colombian justice officials to negotiate the cartel 
members' surrender in exchange for legal benefits such as a 
reduction in sentences and house arrests, but the government 
rejected this. Arrieta said that the remodeling work being done 
in the Palmira jail is almost finished, and this is where the 
leaders of the organization responsible for 80 percent of the 
cocaine shipments to the United States will be sent. He 
mentioned that Urdinola "is not an important man" within the 
cartel and that the authorities were fully aware of his 
"desperate plans" to surrender to justice. 
  According to the Colombian media quoting reports from state 
security organizations, the surrender of important Cali Cartel 
members -- including leader Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela -- is 
imminent.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours Newscast," report by Alvaro Ayala] </F>
  [Text] Colombian Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff got 
tired of U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno's accusations and 
today told her that Colombia does not accept foreign pressure 
when making legal decisions because it is a sovereign state. 
Alvaro Ayala reports. 
  [Ayala] U.S. Attorney General Reno told de Greiff: I am 
increasingly concerned by the fact that in your correspondence 
you do not include information on the process of conversations 
with the chieftains of the Cali Cartel and because you have not 
mentioned that the Prosecutor General's Office plans to 
prosecute and put those chieftains on trial. These omissions 
are what create the environment of distrust you mention in your 
letters. 
  Today the prosecutor general reacted and reminded his U.S. 
counterpart, Janet Reno, that in Colombia the judicial system 
functions independently, without bending to foreign pressure. 
  [Begin de Greiff recording] Colombia's Judicial Branch 
cannot 
be subjected to the evaluations Ms. Reno may want to pass on the 
evidence they supply. Cooperation is fine, but impositions are 
not. [end recording] 
  The prosecutor general said that on 20 June he will be 65 
and 
that his remaining in his post depends on the Supreme Court of 
Justice. He said that personally he would like to complete the 
four-year period for which he was elected. 
  The Supreme Court of Justice, the High Council of the 
Judiciary, and a U.S. court adviser, have stated their support 
for de Greiff. 
  William Davis is an important U.S. court adviser. He is in 
Colombia participating in a seminar on court backlogs organized 
by the High Council of the Judiciary. He spoke at the seminar 
with journalists and spoke out in defense of Prosecutor General 
de Greiff, saying that the institution de Greiff heads is too 
new to have to endure the strong criticism of the U.S. attorney 
general. 
  [Begin Davis recording] I said: Look, these things take five 
years and they are complex. We live in a world where people 
expect results in a matter of months, weeks, or days instead of 
years. [end recording] 
  The Judicial Branch stated its support for the independence 
of the Prosecutor General's Office and not only criticized Ms. 
Reno's intrusion but also the Colombian Security Council's 
decision to reject the transfer of five Medellin Cartel members 
from Bogota to Itagui. 
  [Begin recording] [Justice Pablo Caceres] Other countries 
cannot expect the autonomy of the Prosecutor General's Office to 
depend on their opinions. 
  [Justice Ricardo Calvete] If the Prosecutor General's Office 
finds that these people's due process and their right to a 
defense must be guaranteed, then ways must be found to strictly 
comply with this. [end recording]

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] At a strictly confidential academic conference 
yesterday, high-ranking officials of the Prosecutor General's 
Office and representatives of the Criminal Bar Association 
discussed the problems that plague the Prosecutor General's 
Office. 
  With regard to operations and administration, the analysis 
was conclusive: Proceedings for taking witness testimony are 
handled inadequately, there is no proper training in questioning 
techniques, there are not enough investigators to back up 
prosecuting attorneys, there is a lack of timely information on 
prosecutions, and serious deficiencies in the preliminary 
investigation units mean that cases may remain in the initial 
inquiry stage for months. 
  In a conciliatory tone, Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco 
Sintura, Bogota Regional Prosecutor's Office Director Jorge 
Enrique Bautista, Bogota Sectional Prosecutor's Office Director 
Jose Haxel de la Pava, Bogota Technical Corps Director Luis 
Fernando Velez, and trial attorneys studied the problems and 
pledged to seek solutions. 
  First, the prosecution officials gathered at the Educational 
Extension Center of Colombia heard complaints aired by the 
attorneys, led by criminal law specialist Antonio Cancino. They 
acknowledged that the problems stem from the lack of trained 
personnel and the failure to realize that there is a new 
accusatory system in place in Colombia. 
  These were the main topics of discussion yesterday. 
<H5>  Questioning Witnesses </H5>
  The trial attorneys claimed that the proceedings for taking 
witness testimony are almost never conducted by a prosecuting 
attorney, and they complained that even though the proceedings 
should be regarded as a single process, each session is 
conducted by a different clerk. 
  Thus, if five witnesses are to testify in a case, each one 
is 
heard by a different official, and often that official does not 
know the background of the case. As a result, according to the 
trial attorneys, some incongruous decisions can be made. 
  In some cases, the attorneys alleged, the person who is 
supposed to do the questioning ends up asking the witness to 
give a narrative of the case. "Many officials say to the 
witness, `Tell me something about the case so I can ask you 
questions,' and consequently, when the prosecuting attorney 
reads the transcript, he finds holes and anomalies that he must 
clear up by calling in the witness again and taking his 
testimony personally." 
<H5>  Preliminary Proceedings </H5>
  "With the advent of the Prosecutor General's Office, 
everything became a preliminary proceeding. Now, even when there 
is a known suspect, the prosecutors begin the process as if they 
were still in the inquiry stage, with no suspects. They take up 
to six months to go through preliminary proceedings before they 
finally decide that there is enough evidence to file charges 
against the suspect." 
  This assertion by a criminal attorney reveals that there is 
a 
crisis in the operation of the Preliminary and Permanent 
Investigation Units. According to the attorneys, many 
investigations are carried out almost entirely in these units, 
and then by the time charges are filed and an attempt is made to 
find the suspect, he has already fled. 
  A prosecutor in the Bogota special unit acknowledged that he 
has discovered a very common error in this preliminary 
investigation unit, and that is the opening of an investigation 
without sufficient evidence against the accused. 
  "In this case, the opposite of what the attorneys are 
complaining about occurs," he said. "Sometimes the prosecuting 
attorneys in the preliminary investigation unit decide that 
because the victim was able to name the suspect, he has to be 
called in for questioning, and of course formal charges have to 
be filed, when in fact they have not checked to see if this is 
an unfounded accusation." 
<H5>  Clerks </H5>
  The trial attorneys revealed that a high percentage of the 
1,030 attorneys surveyed by the Bar Association believe that the 
new Common Clerk's Office is a failure. 
  These clerk's offices, which are part of the new structure 
of 
the Prosecutor General's Office, consist of an executive clerk 
and several deputy clerks whose job is to handle the 
administration of case files: filings, notices, etc. 
  These offices, complain the attorneys, have turned the 
prosecuting attorneys into "faceless bureaucrats," because 
everything related to a prosecution is discussed with the 
clerks, who are generally not familiar with the facts of the 
case. 
  The attorneys also complained about problems created by the 
inadequate organization of cases. Thus, they explained, to find 
a case file at a Common Clerk's Office, it is necessary to have 
three numbers: the internal reference number, the unit case 
number, and the assignment office intake number. 
  In addition, the attorneys say, some employees at the 
clerk's 
office are very rude at times. "The issue of the clerk's 
offices," said spokesmen for the trial attorneys, "is the 
sticking point in the Prosecutor General's Office. And we are 
the only ones who are aware of that, since we are on the other 
side of the railing." 
  As for the Regional Prosecutor's Offices, which are 
responsible for drug trafficking and terrorism cases, the 
criticism focused on poor initial processing of cases. According 
to the attorneys--and this was acknowledged by the Prosecutor 
General's Office--many cases are poorly identified in the 
system. Sometimes, only the first defendant's name appears, and 
codefendants are listed as "others" in the files. As a result, 
trying to find the case file for one of those "others" can be a 
Herculean task. 
<H5>  The Technical Investigation Corps </H5>
  With regard to the Technical Investigation Corps (CTI), the 
attorneys noted that it is a subdivision of the Prosecutor 
General's Office that has very limited technical, human, and 
financial resources to meet the needs of the prosecutors and of 
the investigations that are carried out all over the country. 
  The trial attorneys complained that the Prosecutor General's 
Office has issued a directive instructing prosecutors to use 
only the services of CTI agents whenever possible. 
  Nevertheless, the shortage of personnel makes this almost 
impossible. In Bogota, for example, there are 59 investigators 
working on all the prosecution cases under way in the 317 
Departmental Prosecutor's Offices. 
<H5>  [Box, p 11A] </H5>
<H5>  Prosecutor General's Office Responds </H5>
  The representatives of the Prosecutor General's Office who 
participated in the debate welcomed the criminal attorneys' 
proposals and admitted that there are errors that must be 
corrected immediately. 
  Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Jose Sintura stated that 
there is a great shortage of Judicial Police investigators, not 
only in the CTI, but also in the National Police and the 
Administrative Department of Security (DAS). For now, however, 
the government has said that no new positions can be created 
until 1995. 
  The official admitted that there are very few employees 
trained in the techniques of questioning witnesses. "Sometimes," 
he said, "the questioner asks the witness two or three very 
simple questions and then asks him if he has anything more to 
add, just because he has to close the proceeding." 
  He went on to say that total quality courses have already 
been implemented so that employees of the Prosecutor General's 
Office can begin training. 
  As for the problems in the Common Clerk's Offices, the 
deputy 
prosecutor general stated that in the next few days, a pilot 
program will begin in the clerk's offices. This program, called 
Plan Chrysalis, includes the completion of a data processing 
system, as the current system is inadequate. 
  In this regard, the director of the Regional Prosecutor's 
Office of Bogota, Jorge Enrique Bautista, said that there have 
been data processing problems in the regional prosecutor's 
offices since the beginning, and as a result, it is often 
difficult to find case files or to determine the status of a 
case. He noted, however, that a new system is being devised 
under the auspices of the Social Studies Front (FES). 
  Referring to the problems of incompetence or irregularities 
committed by employees, Sintura urged the trial attorneys to 
file complaints with the Treasury Inspector's Office so that 
those responsible can be identified and punished.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 14 Mar (EFE) -- The National 
Civil Registry Office has reported that the nomination of former 
[Economic Development] Minister Ernesto Samper Pizano as the 
official presidential candidate of the governing Liberal Party 
of Colombia for the 8 May elections was consolidated today after 
the counting of 89 percent of the party votes cast on Sunday [13 
March]. 
  With its latest communique, the election organization 
considered the counting of votes cast by Liberal Party members 
in response to the "internal primary" carried out by the party 
during the parliamentary elections to be concluded. The primary 
was independent of the parliamentary elections and was made upon 
a request from the party's board of directors. 
  Out of 2,562,694 votes counted, the 43-year-old Samper, a 
former ambassador to Spain, obtained 1,245,283. Humberto de la 
Calle, who was government minister until two years ago, 
concurring with the period when Samper was development minister, 
followed with 335,165 votes. 
  Samper Pizano, one of the seven presidential hopefuls who 
participated in the "internal primary," will be officially 
proclaimed party candidate on Friday during the celebration of 
the party's national convention in Santa Fe de Bogota. 
  In May the Liberal Party candidate will compete with 10 
other 
candidates from the various political parties who want to 
replace President Cesar Gaviria as president of Colombia on 7 
August for the 1994-1998 period. Polls show Samper and Andres 
Pastrana, of the Social Conservative Party, as the people's 
favorites. 
  National Registrar Luis Camilo Osorio explained today that 
his office will not issue any more bulletins on the votes for 
the liberal candidates because he has much work to do with the 
final count of the votes for the Senate and the Chamber of 
Representatives. 
  During Sunday's elections, in addition to absenteeism of 70 
percent, 14 percent of the votes were either void or blank. 
Osorio has attributed this to the cumbersome ballots that 
contained more than 5,300 names of candidates to the Senate and 
the Chamber of Representatives.

<F P=106> [Report by Javier Dario Restrepo from the "24 Hours </F>
Newscast"] 
  [Text] People did not come out to vote yesterday the way 
they have in the last 15 years despite the fact there were over 
600 campaigns seeking votes. All the politicians' machinery 
proved ineffective when it came to getting voters motivated. 
  [Begin recording] [unidentified person] I do not care if I 
did not vote. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Don't you care? 
  [Unidentified person] No. [end recording] 
  This woman was part of the 68 percent of the population who 
did not vote. If yesterday's elections are compared to those in 
the last 15 years, they represent a setback in voter turnout. 
From 4 million voters in 1978, we went to 5.5 million in 1982, 
nearly 7 million in 1986, over 7.5 million in 1990, and back to 
5.5 million yesterday. Political expert Hernando Gomez Buendia 
commented on this phenomenon. 
  [Begin Buendia recording] A high voter turnout is very 
dangerous because it signifies there is a big conflict and 
people feel threatened by a very serious decision to be made. It 
is normal to have a high abstention rate. In parliamentary 
elections in Colombia, Sunday's figure is not disastrous. [end 
recording] 
  In addition, few people voted yesterday because the 
Congress' 
image does not excite people. There is no faith in parties 
either; the ballots were confusing to many people, and it 
rained. Given these reasons, yesterday's election was not seen 
as a classical game of politics -- a games that fill the public 
stadiums -- but as a game played in the Olaya Stadium.

  [Text] The Senate election left a large part of the 
country's poor and neglected portions with no voice at all: 
Putumayo, Caqueta, Guaviare, Choco, Vaupes, Amazonas, Guainia, 
Vichada, Casanare, Arauca, Meta, and Quindio. Meta has Senator 
Jorge Ariel Infante, and Quindio has Samuel Grisales. 
  At the Chamber of Representatives, the dark spots are 
Amazonas, which lost Milquesedec Lopez and Jairo Jose Ruiz 
Medina, Guainia, which lost the seat of Guillermo Britto, and 
Vaupes, which had Alfonso Gonzalez Vargas. These last three 
departments are in a serious situation, if one considers the 
fact they were completely erased from the parliamentary map; 
this shows how the struggle among the traditional politicians to 
get votes from all over the country-- thanks to the nationwide 
electoral conscription--does not always work out, silencing 
regions that have always been forgotten by the state.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Rafael Pardo by Sandra </F>
Vergara in Santa Fe de Bogota on 15 January; from the "National 
Newscast" -- recorded] 
  [Text] A short while ago I spoke with Defense Minister 
Rafael Pardo. He reacted to a report that Amnesty 
International has just released in which it directly accuses the 
Colombian Armed Forces of committing most of the political 
crimes and social cleansing homicides in Colombia. 
  [Begin recording] [Pardo] The statistics are being 
manipulated. They cited a number of facts and events and 
accused the military forces of committing crimes that have not 
been tried and for which no sentencing has been handed down. 
With ill intention they mentioned these cases. They claim that 
the military forces are involved. This is evidently highly 
ill-intentioned. 
  [Vergara] That report suggests that the Armed Forces are 
working with paramilitary forces or that they are allied with 
the death squads. 
  [Pardo] I repeat, I know nothing about that report. We will 
react to it as soon as we know about it. The claim that there 
is an alliance between military forces and paramilitary groups 
is absolutely false. Paramilitary groups are not our allies. In 
fact, the Colombian military forces pursue them. [end recording]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 15 Mar (EFE) -- Colombian 
Communications Minister William Jaramillo Gomez today announced 
that he will soon tender his resignation to President Cesar 
Gaviria. 
  Jaramillo Gomez, Liberal Party member, minister since May 
1992, and a former ambassador to Spain, made the announcement at 
a National Newspaper Association, ANDIARIOS, meeting in Santa Fe 
de Bogota today. He is the third communications minister since 
Gaviria assumed office on 7 August 1990. 
  He was preceded by advertising agent Alberto Casas 
Santamaria, currently ambassador to Venezuela, who held the post 
from August 1990 to November 1991, and journalist Mauricio 
Vargas Linares, who held it from November 1991 to May 1992. 
Jaramillo Gomez is a former mayor of Medellin. 
  Jaramillo Gomez hinted that he intends to resign because he 
plans to accept a nomination as candidate for governor of 
Antioquia, his native department, located in the country's 
northwest, in the coming October elections. 
  After last Sunday's legislative elections, political circles 
anticipate the resignations of Government Minister Fabio 
Villegas and Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos, both 
Liberal Party members, in what could be Gaviria's last crisis 
before he steps down on 7 August. 
  Villegas and Santos will participate in Liberal Party 
candidate Ernesto Samper's campaign, according to political 
sources. Samper, former economic development minister and 
former ambassador to Spain -- this is precisely where he 
succeeded Jaramillo Gomez -- on Sunday was elected the official 
Liberal Party candidate with 48.21 percent of the party votes, 
defeating six rivals. 
  In the first round of the elections, to be held on 8 May, 
Samper will contend for the Presidency of Colombia for the 
1994-1998 term with Conservative Party candidate Andres Pastrana 
Arango.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Subcommander Marcos of the </F>
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) by Juan Manuel 
Alvarado; "somewhere in the jungle of Chiapas"; date not given; 
first of two parts] 
  [Text] Still clutching his weapon, Subcommander Marcos put 
aside his cold expression, smiled through his ski mask, and led 
us into his community. He allowed us to see one of the huts 
where he lives, and he told us part of his life story, talking 
of his infancy, youth, and his adult life. 
  He became sullen when speaking of the love he left behind 
and 
when discussing his ideas on what this country could and should 
be. Subcommander Marcos did all of this in a hamlet where we 
could not return if we had to; we are still unsure how we got 
there or precisely where it is located. 
  This allowed us to get to know a pleasant subcommander and 
learn intimate details of his life. He told us part of his life 
story and showed us his customs; he recalled he had lived in 
Monterrey for a year while discussing with us the happy and the 
sad. He talked about his unknown identity, his "having no 
future," and, more than anything else, he showed a Marcos, who, 
as he says, "can die at any moment." 
  Our eagerness to talk with the subcommander did not 
diminish, 
and it was only surpassed by our curiosity and desire to know 
the real Marcos -- the man who hides behind this nom de guerre. 
  With this in mind, we -- reporters from EL NORTE and a 
photographer -- went to this encounter, which was perhaps a 
frustrated encounter. 
  Outfitted with a rented jeep, a can of gasoline, blankets, 
and food, we departed for San Cristobal de las Casas en route to 
Ocosingo. From there we went to the hamlet of San Miguel, where 
we arrived at 0715 on Sunday, 6 March. A long line of 
journalists and reporters grabbed our attention and perhaps even 
dismayed us a bit. Eventually, patience gave way to impatience. 
Some reporters gave up and left. Nevertheless, about 40 
reporters remained behind, and we were among them. 
  At almost 1500, two Indians ran into the hamlet. They asked 
for the reporters from EL NORTE and REFORMA. Only we were 
included, and the others excluded. Not even the foreign 
reporters were taken into account, including those from THE NEW 
YORK TIMES, as well as those from the domestic press, as well as 
reporters from Spain, France, and Canada. Only reporters from 
EL NORTE and REFORMA would be taken to see Marcos. 
  The order was to wait until the rest of the reporters 
departed. We had to wait until 2230 on Sunday. There were two 
failed attempts to enter the jungle, but the third time was the 
charm. 
  When we first came upon him, he was outlined in a 
silhouette. 
We noticed the smoke of his pipe and his height, for he stood 
taller than the others who surrounded him. This was how we met 
Marcos: He emerged from darkness. 
  "Well, get ready. No questions right now, but if you would 
like, we can talk and wait for questions to come up... Come on 
then; I am going to take you," said the subcommander, who 
flirted with a female reporter from a magazine who had joined 
the group. 
  He proceeded in a red pickup truck, remaining in the 
constant 
guard of heavily armed soldiers. Three of them were women, 
while three others were men who carefully searched us and our 
jeep. 
  We advanced in almost complete darkness. The jeep bounced 
the entire way until we arrived at a small house. We were then 
asked to leave the vehicle, and from here we were led by a 
female soldier into a hut. The warning was clear: "Make no 
reference to the names of any hamlets or the amount of time it 
took you to travel here, and do not mention any specific 
markings along the way. If you want to take photographs of 
people, you must wait for them to cover their faces." 
  We slept there on Sunday. The following day, Monday, 7 
March, we waited until 1500. At that time, the subcommander 
arrived with his guards. He had come to pick us up. 
  The man who startled the Mexican political system and 
surprised the world, decided right then to drive EL NORTE's jeep 
and asked one of the reporters and a photographer to ride in the 
truck. I was asked to accompany him. I now had a "chauffeur" and 
a revolutionary. He found it difficult to shift gears and 
accelerate the car in second gear and was very careful when he 
drove. Despite this, the vehicle got stuck, and we were only 
able to extricate it by pushing it out. 
  We had to go through three EZLN checkpoints, and at each one 
we were examined more carefully than the previous occasion. We 
were also warned about deactivated land mines along the side of 
the road. During the drive, the subcommander said something 
strange and out of place. He said: "I lived in Monterrey." 
Somewhat confused, I asked him very respectfully: Sir, did you 
really live in Monterrey? What part? 
  He grabbed his pipe filled with vanilla-smelling tobacco and 
answered over the jeep's noise: "Yes, I lived in Monterrey for 
almost a year. I lived near Felix U. Gomez. What I liked most 
about the place was the mountainous region. I worked in the 
outskirts of Monterrey, near Santa Catarina selling secondhand 
clothes. I was a secondhand clothes dealer. I only sold native 
clothes, nothing imported," he stipulated. "I also lived in the 
public washrooms of the Truckers Union located in Avenida Colon. 
Those were extremely filthy washrooms. I would also use the 
washrooms of the cinemas located in the same avenue. I was 
always around there." 
  He commented that the mountainous regions are quite special 
because over there they do not like charlatans. "I am going to 
give you a hint so that you can identify me. I played second 
string for the Rayados [not further specified]. I was what you 
could call a reserve player. I played right field. It was 
beautiful to fly in the outfield," he commented. "Beer is very 
popular there," he added, "from Monterrey I went to Veracruz 
where I sold fish." 
  He recalled that in Maderos Avenue, there was a restaurant 
that specialized in preparing goat meat with a very special 
flavor. He interrupts his comments to say that a Nuevo Mexico 
group had written him asking him to rescue that state. Later on, 
he commented about the traditions of the inhabitants and all the 
arrangements involved in getting married, like the gifts and the 
first time the couple meet on the wedding day. 
  He finally parks the jeep and tells us to get out. We walk 
for a short while until we reach the top of a hill where we 
enter a shack where there were several other EZLN members. We 
decided to rest, and the subcommander did likewise. A short time 
later, we began the interview with another reporter. Sitting in 
the hut surrounded by the other EZLN members, he commented that 
so far there had been no accord, negotiation, or agreement 
between the EZLN and Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis. 
The subcommander promised another interview later. He ate by 
himself and later departed but not before saying that he would 
return in the morning to take us to a party commemorating 
Women's Day. 
  On 8 Tuesday, he entered the hut very early in the morning 
amid the sounds of crickets and birds. We had beans, rice, and 
coffee for breakfast at 0700. There are no refreshments, 
television, or any other entertainment, only poverty. 
  Silvestre and Arturo, two Zapatists, broke the early morning 
stillness with two of their ballads: "I am an insurgent soldier, 
seeking a revolution I move along. And they all want to fight 
together as militia men... Without much to brag about, without 
any rest, they left their homes, they left their loved ones. I 
am an insurgent soldier, seeking a revolution I move along." 
  The subcommander returns at noon accompanied by several men 
and women, a part of the revolution that did not reached 
Chiapas. He drove our jeep again, and we reached a distant town 
after driving for a long time, while an airplane overflew the 
region. The sound of chickens, birds, and abundant vegetation 
gave way to three other EZLN checkpoints. We finally reached the 
town where arrangements for the party were still being made and 
the subcommander was responsible for bringing flowers. 
  He softened his stance and proceeded to tell about his 
entry into the Indian world and later the EZLN. "We arrived in 
the jungle in 1983, nearly 11 years ago. It was a very small 
group, only five." 
  The EZLN emerged with peasants tired of living like that. 
The 
original five arrived from the city, fed up with the legal forms 
of struggle, failure, and limitations, let alone the failure of 
the 1970's guerrillas. "This group set up camp in the jungle and 
started to adapt themselves to the environment to survive. Those 
were hardy days. It was necessary to extract food, dwellings, 
medicines, everything, from the jungle. There was no other way, 
and the villagers were not supporting us." 
  Seated on a school desk, he told about how they learned to 
survive first and then spread their ideas without religious 
interference. 
  His eyes are light and honey colored. His beard is gray and 
his dark brown straight hair shows out from under his ski mask. 
A tobacco smell surrounds him. He says: "The Indians had just 
had an experience with a group from the north, the northerners, 
I think they were called -- popular politics, Maoist proletarian 
inclinations. They infiltrated the movement and tried to gain 
access to the communities' structures but were thrown out. They 
included Hugo Andres Araujo and Salinas' brother, Raul, but they 
were taken out also." 
  Marcos joked openly and appeared to be sincere during his 
interview with EL NORTE. 
  Lunchtime came, and we were served pork with rice and beans. 
The subcommander ate in his hut. We approached the hut and saw 
more than 50 heavily armed EZLN soldiers protecting the area. We 
were allowed to take pictures of Zapatists preparing food. In 
the background we saw Marcos' wooden hut, roofed with zinc and 
straw, with ventilation portholes and a guarded door. His 
bathroom has no massaging tub or any luxurious features. He only 
has a latrine and a water tank with a hose attached to pour 
water. Mud, smells, and barefoot children walking around make up 
this scene. 
  On the subcommander's invitation we went to a river to 
bathe. 
The cold water flowed slowly in the shadows. We dived into the 
stream, always guarded by a Zapatist. We returned and waited for 
the party, for which loudspeakers had been installed. A gas tank 
and a lamp were placed where the dance, to which all the people 
had been invited, would take place. Later, more than 150 armed 
Zapatists came down from the mountain led by the subcommander to 
start the celebration. In the background there were four unarmed 
women in civilian clothes but with their faces covered by shawls. 
  Capt. Benito announced the beginning of the cultural 
program, 
which featured songs, speeches, and military formations. The 
Zapatist anthem opened the celebration: "Zapatist fighters, the 
horizon is already in sight. The road will bring down those 
coming from behind. Let's march forward so we can win the fight 
because our homeland needs the efforts of the Zapatists. Men, 
women, and children, we will always make our effort with 
peasants, workers, and all the people. We must set the example 
and stick to our slogan. We will defend the homeland and die for 
freedom. Our history says that exploitation will come to an end. 
Our people will fight for freedom." 
  The party concluded with Subcommander Marco's departure in 
the darkness. He promised that he would be back on Wednesday 9 
March for an exclusive interview with EL NORTE. He arrived after 
breakfast. He was reminded that, for the time being, we did not 
want to hear about the movement but about the man behind the ski 
mask and the lives of some Indians who had fought. "No, not 
that. I cannot say anything personal now. Maybe later. Let us 
start somewhere else," said the subcommander seated under the 
roof of a hut whose corners were guarded by three armed men and 
three armed women.

  [Editorial Report] Monterrey EL NORTE (Foreign Edition) in 
Spanish on page 10A of its 12 March edition publishes a 
1,000-word report on an interview with Subcommander Marcos of 
the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN). The report, which 
is the second of two parts, is by Juan Manuel Alvarado who 
interviewed Marcos "somewhere in the jungle of Chiapas." The 
date of the interview is not given. 
  Alvarado describes Marcos as a "lively" individual who 
"suddenly becomes sullen and pensive when he recounts family 
members he has not seen for more than 10 years or when he 
predicts that his days are numbered." When recalling his early 
days in the jungle, Subcommander Marcos points out "he began to 
learn the dialect first, and later taught military courses, all 
of which helped him become a subcommander." At first, he used 
to write "about politics, as well as the domestic and 
international situations." He says: "Those were the times of 
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front offensives," 
adding, "things in the USSR were starting to happen, discussions 
on the European Common Market had gotten under way, and I had 
the option to do just that -- political analysis. Nevertheless, 
I was young and strong, and therefore I opted for something 
else. My comrades told me I should try the jungle, and so I 
did." 
  When asked about his youth, he says he had a "normal 
childhood." He describes his family as middle class, and he 
notes that he attended grammar school, high school, preparatory 
courses, and college, adding, "I did my graduate work in the 
jungle." Marcos is also quoted as saying, "Everything began 
with my parents," because from the time he was very young, "my 
parents always told us there were injustices in the world, and 
one could not just sit back and do nothing. Of course, they 
never took up arms. They were not religious people; they only 
did it out of love for humanity." Marcos adds, "My parents were 
aware of all the injustices, and they considered it their duty 
to instruct their children not to remain indifferent." 
  Subcommander Marcos says he went to "public schools and a 
university in one of the provinces," and that in addition to 
studying he enjoyed playing baseball, soccer, and basketball, 
"but most of all, I enjoyed reading." Alvarado points out that 
Marcos did not want to answer any questions about his personal 
life, and he would only say he left home as an adolescent and 
does not know if any of his brothers are alive. 
  Subcommander Marcos says: "Up until 1983, I did not 
participate in any movements, and that is why I tell 
photographers they are wasting their time by taking my picture. 
My photo is not in any file, not even in the Traffic 
Department's files, much less as a foreign agent. My ski mask 
does not hide a face with a past but, rather, a face without a 
future." 
  In concluding the interview, Subcommander Marcos says: "I 
was surprised when it was said we were awakening the people. 
The truth is that we wanted to awaken them, but we thought it 
was going to take much longer, and that other factors would 
influence this process. If we had foreseen how seriously our 
words would be taken by the people, we would have told them many 
more things we have not yet said, because we are just starting 
to feel our way."

<F P=106> [Report by Victor Barillas and Oscar Camacho, including the </F>
"text" of a statement by Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for 
peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, on 11 March; place not 
given] 
  [Text] Yesterday, Manuel Camacho Solis defined himself as a 
"factor of reconciliation and stability and a useful element in 
the transition to democracy." In view of the "pressure" he is 
under to get him to exit the nation's political scene, the 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas warned he 
is not ready to let anyone infringe on his civil rights and that 
he "will not act in a hasty manner." He added: "I cannot, 
simply because of pressure, invalidate my political life and 
what I represent in politics." 
  In response to criticism leveled against the programs he 
headed as Mexico City mayor, Camacho said he is not going to 
allow himself to be turned into a force "that simply explains 
the flaws of others." He added that if there is no endorsement 
for amending the IFE [Federal Electoral Institute], Cofipe 
[Federal Code of Institutions and Electoral Procedures], and 
the agreements on peace, justice, and democracy, he will make 
the necessary political decision to help democracy advance and 
to foster the country's unity. 
  Speaking to some 300 reporters, Camacho outlined his 
political position in light of criticism leveled against the 
programs he implemented when he headed the Federal District 
Department [DDF], and he discussed the pressure exerted to get 
him to leave politics. He affirmed he will not submit to 
pressure nor will he act in a hasty manner. He stressed: "My 
duty is to contribute to unity and to participate in Mexico's 
democratic transition. Camacho Solis will be a factor of 
reconciliation and stability and a useful element in the 
transition to democracy." 
  Responding to criticism regarding his performance as mayor, 
Camacho Solis warned: "The future of the country will not be 
built by a single force. An alliance of national forces will be 
built to give the government the necessary foundations, and one 
must be up to the task demanded by the times ahead." 
  He then defended his former assistants at the DDF -- some of 
whom served as assistants in the peace process -- from "attacks" 
by some political columnists. "False information" has been 
leaked about these people, but those making these comments "are 
the ones who are connected to corruption and support it. I now 
hear that if Camacho makes a unfavorable decision, he will harm 
the interests of the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party], 
but these people do not realize that some of the programs he 
headed in the city continue to have the support of the majority 
of Mexico City's residents." 
  In this way he was responding to PRI presidential candidate 
Luis Donaldo Colosio's criticism of his "Does Not Circulate 
Today" program [a program to keep cars off the streets on 
certain days]. Camacho Solis added: "I do not accept the fact 
that some people want to turn me into a force that simply 
explains the flaws of others. Camacho has proven his loyalty to 
the president and has been efficient in carrying out the task 
entrusted to him." 
  Regarding the transition to democracy, he said there are two 
paths: "The path I consider most advisable would be the approval 
of the amendments to the IFE and Cofipe, which will enable us to 
stick to the agreements on peace, justice, and democracy signed 
by the parties and the presidential candidates. After I fulfill 
my mission in Chiapas, and if the conditions exist to allow me 
to contribute to guaranteeing the transition to democracy, I 
will support the transition and defend its results." 
  As for the other path, Comacho said: "If we fail to make 
advances in democracy, if instead of a peace agreement we have 
polarization, or if some want to infringe on my political rights 
as a citizen after I fulfill my mission in Chiapas, I will make 
the necessary political decision to help Mexico advance in 
democracy and unity." 
  He noted: "There is nothing more important to me than 
maintaining and strengthening Mexico's unity -- not unity for 
the sake of a mere conglomerate, but a unity that stems from 
feeling one's legitimate interests are assured and from opening 
the doors of institutions to the demands for justice of the 
Mexican society and people. In other words, we must create a 
nonexclusive unity -- a unity that is founded on peace, justice, 
and democracy. This is my position, and this is where I will 
be." 
  In terms of the pressure to get him to leave politics, he 
said: "I am hearing now that Camacho can create problems, even 
though the work by this commissioner has always served and will 
continue to contribute to the country's economic, political, and 
financial stability. Some want to pressure me by fabricating 
administrative problems linked to those who are my assistants in 
Chiapas, when everyone knows the decisions at the highest levels 
of the Mexico City government were handled with honesty." 
  At this point, some reporters applauded his much-awaited 
statement. This was the first ovation. He said: "I do not 
accept the fact that some people want to turn me into a force 
that simply explains the flaws of others. Camacho has proven 
his loyalty to the president and has been efficient in carrying 
out the task entrusted to him." 
  He said: "Camacho will not present a problem for the other 
candidates who intend to carry out their duty to consolidate 
their political campaigns and demonstrate their effectiveness to 
the people. This opportunity has always been open." 
  Following is the full text of his statement: 
  "Today, I would like to comment on two issues. The first is 
related to a meeting I just had with the Coleto Civic Front. 
This is a very important issue for Chiapas. Later, I plan to 
refer to another unrelated issue. 
  Today I met with a delegation representing the Coleto Civic 
Front headed by Mr. Ricardo Diaz Martinez. The delegates 
stressed that the population of San Cristobal de las Casas 
favors peace and is working toward creating a favorable climate 
for negotiations. They are proud of the fact that San Cristobal 
de las Casas, their city, is hosting the peace talks. They have 
indicated their intention to be present as witnesses during the 
signing of any peace agreements that may be reached should the 
EZLN grass roots decide to accept any proposals. 
  With this symbolic act, reconciliation in San Cristobal de 
las Casas has already begun. During my next visit I will meet 
with the San Cristobal Civic Front in a 
friendship-and-reconciliation ceremony. 
  Now I am going to refer to the other issue -- the issue of 
politics. 
  Ever since I was sent to Chiapas, I have done nothing but 
work for peace, often taking risks I had to take. I have spent 
the entire time honestly involved in this endeavor, and I have 
also taken advantage of all my experience with this single end 
in mind. 
  I will continue to do this until my mission is complete. It 
is because I concentrated on this goal and did not distract 
myself with other political issues that I have been able to show 
positive results to all those who trusted in my efforts, 
starting with the president of the republic. 
  Once again I would like to acknowledge the categorical 
support received from the Mexican Army in favor of a political 
solution. 
  Of course, to me it would have been preferable to continue 
moving forward with the Chiapas peace process before outlining 
my political position. Nevertheless, the circumstances and 
pressure involved are of such magnitude and force that, if I do 
not clarify my position now, I will end up damaging the search 
for peace in Chiapas, further complicating the process. 
  Currently, pressure is being exerted for this commissioner 
to 
withdraw from the country's political scene. I am hearing now 
that Camacho can create problems, even though the work by this 
commissioner has always served and will continue to contribute 
to the country's economic, political, and financial stability. 
  Some want to pressure me by fabricating administrative 
problems linked to those who are my assistants in Chiapas, when 
everyone knows the decisions at the highest levels of the Mexico 
City government were handled with honesty. 
  Those people leaking this type of false information are the 
ones who are connected to corruption and support it. 
  I now hear that if Camacho makes an unfavorable decision he 
will harm the interests of the PRI, but these people do not 
realize that some of the programs he headed in the city continue 
to have the support of the majority of Mexico City's residents. 
  No, I do not accept the fact that some people want to turn 
me 
into a force that simply explains the flaws of others. Camacho 
has proven his loyalty to the president and has been efficient 
in carrying out the task entrusted to him. I have made 
decisions in accordance with what is best for Mexico. Camacho 
will not present a problem for the other candidates who intend 
to carry out their duty to consolidate their political campaigns 
and demonstrate their effectiveness to the people. This 
opportunity has always been open. What I am not willing to do is 
to stop exercising my rights as a citizen. Mexico needs to 
bolster its opportunities, its road toward reconciliation, its 
democratic opening, its responses to the middle class, its 
resolve to be part of the new global economy, the vitality of 
its history, and its determination to open its door to justice. 
  I cannot, simply because of pressure, invalidate my 
political life and what I represent in politics. The future of 
the country will not be built by a single force. An alliance of 
national forces will be built to give the government the 
necessary foundations, and one must be up to the task demanded 
by the times ahead. 
  The best guarantee for economic and political stability 
today 
is the definite and orderly transit toward democracy. This 
should be done without violence and with guarantees for all -- 
for the private sector, the workers, and for every political and 
civil organization without exception. A key guarantee of this 
entire process is to firmly uphold those agreements responsible 
for the country's macroeconomic balance and to ensure foreign 
investment confidence in the Mexican economy. 
  What Chiapas has proven is that if the forces of moderation, 
democracy, and peaceful change fail to strengthen themselves, 
the measures adopted by interest groups will make the task of 
government more difficult by creating deep divisions. 
  Let us see now, my friends. Let us now take a brief recess 
and exercise some reconciliation. I am about to reach the best 
part of all, but it would seem that I will have to leave without 
saying it. 
  As result of all I said before, ladies and gentlemen, I am 
not going to make decisions as a result of pressures, and I will 
not act in a hasty manner. My duty is to contribute to unity 
and to participate in Mexico's democratic transition. Camacho 
Solis will be a factor of reconciliation and stability and a 
useful element in the transition to democracy. Therefore, the 
question is this: What is the best way to do this effectively 
while remaining loyal to the nation? 
  The path I consider most advisable would be the approval of 
the amendments to the IFE and Cofipe, which will enable us to 
stick to the agreements on peace, justice, and democracy signed 
by the parties and the presidential candidates. After I fulfill 
my mission in Chiapas, and if the conditions exist to allow me 
to contribute to guaranteeing the transition to democracy, I 
will support the transition and defend its results. 
  Another possibility is this: If we fail to make advances in 
democracy, if instead of a peace agreement we have polarization, 
or if some want to infringe on my political rights as a citizen 
after I fulfill my mission in Chiapas, I will make the necessary 
political decision to help Mexico advance in democracy and unity. 
  There is nothing more important to me than maintaining and 
strengthening Mexico's unity -- not unity for the sake of a mere 
conglomerate, but a unity that stems from feeling one's 
legitimate interests are assured and from opening the doors of 
institutions to the demands for justice of the Mexican society 
and people. In other words, we must create a nonexclusive unity 
-- a unity that is founded on peace, justice, and democracy. 
This is my position, and this is where I will be. 
  Camacho will be a factor for reconciliation and stability 
and 
a useful instrument for democratic transition. Just as I have 
done since 10 January, at this moment I am wholly concentrating 
in the task of searching for peace in Chiapas. 
  Thank you very much, and thank you for being here."

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- "I will never resign," President Juan 
Carlos Wasmosy stressed when it was mentioned to him that there 
are groups asking that he and Vice President Angel Roberto 
Seifart resign for what the groups believe is their 
responsibility in a bad administration. Asked why he preferred 
to be in Brazil when there was a tense situation in Paraguay, 
Wasmosy said that what is happening in Paraguay is simply 
demagogic populism. 
  The president said that all social groups have the right to 
petition for whatever they please, adding that he would never 
resign his post. Then, he ironically told journalists that they 
themselves could also ask for his resignation. 
  "We are living in a democracy, and I would not like to 
intervene in this game of demagogic populism. I am here today 
because these people have fulfilled something they promised me 
they would do. In October they will again do something I 
requested, which will benefit us all and will reduce production 
costs," Wasmosy said in justifying his presence at the ceremony 
to inaugurate the interconnection between the Tiete and Parana 
Rivers in Sao Paulo State. Asked about Cadelpa's [Paraguayan 
Cotton Chamber] position, Wasmosy said we should not attack the 
association excessively because it has always cooperated with 
the government and peasants. The president then outlined 
Cadelpa's efforts in favor of a successful cotton harvest year 
and used almost the same words used by Cadelpa to explain the 
meaning of the documents seized and aired by the CBII 
[Congressional Investigating Committee on Illegal Activities].

  [Excerpt] Sao Paulo -- Of the five presidents invited for 
the inauguration of the Tiete and Parana Rivers interconnection, 
only Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and Paraguayan 
President Juan Carlos Wasmosy arrived at this city this morning 
to travel to the work area. The Brazilian press expressed 
surprise at Wasmosy's presence during this time of social 
agitation in our country. Presidents Carlos Menem of Argentine, 
Luis Alberto Lacalle of Uruguay, and Itamar Franco himself 
considered the inauguration of minor importance and excused 
themselves from attending with the Sao Paulo governor, giving 
scheduling as their reason. The presidents of Paraguay and 
Bolivia are the only presidents who will be present at this 
afternoon's ceremony. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The very tense situation affecting the country and 
the mobilizations at the national level forced President Juan 
Carlos Wasmosy to deliver a speech that, according to various 
groups, provided nothing for solving the serious problems 
affecting our country. He did not even refer to the main issue 
(the price of cotton) that made peasants decide to march today. 
  Wasmosy made several promises when he said his government is 
already "promoting solutions to the unjust structure of land 
possession and ownership as shown by the latest agricultural 
census: the drop in production of basic agricultural products, 
distorted credit coverage, and the limitations of technical 
assistance." He labeled as an achievement the implementation of 
economic measures aimed at ensuring producers access to 
appropriate and fair credits, and to technical assistance 
adjusted to our needs. 
  In relation to the promises made, he said: "The executive 
branch proposes a policy of expropriation of unproductive land; 
therefore, it will ask Congress for the creation of a bicameral 
committee to establish the necessary legal regulations. Also the 
reorganization of public administration to end corruption and 
impunity, which is something we are doing that will be 
expedited." [sentence fragment as published] 
  He added that within 90 days, in consultation with the 
involved groups, the general guidelines for a medium- and 
long-range action plan will be adjusted to determine measures in 
two main areas: A) the national agricultural policy and B) 
reforms of the institutions in charge of agriculture within the 
framework of state reform. 
  President Wasmosy strongly defended dialogue as the 
mechanism 
for solving the current crisis, and within this context he said 
the Coordination Council for Social Development is one more 
testimony that the doors of dialogue are and will remain open as 
a commitment to consolidating democracy. 
  Wasmosy also made several appeals. He appealed to all 
sectors 
of the population to act with moderation, calm, talent, and 
great responsibility. He also appealed "to agricultural 
exporters, industrialists, and the middlemen to become more 
active in the national effort to give the rural sector better 
conditions, and especially to contribute with preferential 
treatment for those producers who have not yet achieved adequate 
production and to pay the highest price for products in 
accordance with market rules. 
  Wasmosy also said: "The many problems inherited by this 
democracy shows a serious picture that we are identifying with 
the firm decision to find the appropriate solutions without 
falling into the deceiving demagogic and populist formulas of 
very sad memories of the past. 
  Wasmosy also said: We cannot ignore that we are in a 
difficult political, economic, and social situation caused by 
our internal limitations and by the demands of the new 
international situation that have a direct impact on the 
population, especially those linked to the economy's weakest 
sector.

  [Text] Yesterday Francisco Jose de Vargas, president of the 
Chamber of Deputies, confirmed that some time ago several 
legislators were informed that they were under the surveillance 
of the police that guard the Congress building. De Vargas 
disclosed that he held a meeting with Interior Minister Carlos 
Podesta on 11 March to ask him for an explanation, but that the 
minister told him he knew nothing about it. Now, in view of 
this unusual "espionage," the deputies will form a special 
commission to carry out an investigation designed to establish 
who is responsible for this practice. 
  In view of the discovery of a small espionage cell 
discreetly 
established by the police in Congress, according to confirmed 
data, the president of the Chamber of Deputies yesterday 
announced that tomorrow a commission formed by three deputies 
will be established to investigate the reports on espionage made 
some days ago. 
  Yesterday De Vargas confirmed that some days ago legislators 
were warned that their steps and visits were being closely 
followed by the police who guard the Congress building. 
Tomorrow the legislators will start questioning the police 
posted in Congress to find out why the National Police were 
asking for documents from Congress. 
  De Vargas explained that "as far as I know, people arriving 
at the Chamber of Deputies were checked for safety reasons. But 
on Friday afternoon I learned that the police officers made 
lists, which were then classified in a list of those who visited 
me, those who visited the president of the Senate (Evelio 
Fernandez), and another with those who visited the vice 
presidents." 
  "According to the information I obtained, the lists were 
then 
sent, separately or together, to the office of the chief of 
police," said de Vargas. 
  "Once I learned about this I tried to get in touch with 
National Chief of Police (Mario Sapriza) to ask him that this 
practice be suspended immediately, if it was in effect being 
used. I was not able to find him. I phoned the interior 
minister (Carlos Podesta), and told him I had just learned that 
the legislators were under surveillance, in the sense that the 
names and identity card numbers of our visitors were being 
supplied to the chief of police." 
  De Vargas ended: "I told the minister that if the police 
were willing to continue to guard Congress they should do just 
that, but if not they should leave and we would hire private 
security services."

  [Text] During a meeting yesterday to assess the current 
situation in Paraguay, the Paraguayan Bishops Conference [CEP] 
and the Confederation of Paraguayan Clergy [Confederacion de 
Religiosos del Paraguay -- Conferpar] urged the public to assume 
an effective commitment to national unity, through a 
moralization campaign, so as to be able face the socioeconomic 
crisis the country is experiencing. Moreover, the communique 
states that although a democratic process has started, the 
government has still not managed to set up a socioeconomic 
structure that will benefit the weakest. 
  During the CEP-Conferpar meeting held in Ypacarai yesterday, 
the bishops, priests, and nuns issued a communique voicing the 
need for effective commitment to national unity through a 
moralization campaign, so to be able to face the socioeconomic 
crisis the country is suffering through. 
  The communique issued by the religious group maintains that 
they welcome "with happiness" a democratic regime that, among 
other things, made it possible to win public liberties. It 
notes, however, that this is not the case in the socioeconomic 
field, which is "marked by a series of factors and by an 
economic policy in which the social aspect has not been taken 
into account, and which encourages the defense of individual 
interests to the detriment of the common well-being." 
  It then adds that, "sadly," one can witness every day the 
growing deterioration in the country's socioeconomic situation, 
and especially the situation of peasants, workers, and the poor, 
"who are the most affected, and continue to be denied the 
benefits to which they are entitled by law. This situation is 
even worse in the case of the indigenous communities." 
  The clergy maintain that the solution to social problems 
cannot be found through violence and government repression 
against these sectors of society. In this regard they explain 
that the solutions will be found within a framework of dialogue 
and freedom, where none of the sectors resort to the use of 
force. 
  The communique goes on to state "that we have also seen that 
privileged people and groups have distorted the moral values by 
means of a way of life based on moral, psychological, 
administrative, political, and juridical corruption, which is 
reflected among other ways in the deficient administration of 
justice, and in the lack of essential health, education, and 
housing services." 
  In view of this panorama of progressive impoverishment of 
the 
people the clergy reasserted their "preferential treatment of 
the poor," expressing solidarity and support for the initiatives 
taken for the sake of the common well-being, seeking "a fair 
distribution of assets, a broad land reform policy, aid and 
organization for peasant settlements, fair prices for 
agricultural products, the recovery of ill-begotten property, 
salaries commensurate with the cost of living, and the fair 
demands of workers and peasants, who have a right to use 
nonviolent means in their search for a more dignified life." 
  The communique also states that, taking into account the 
social situation prevailing in the country, the national 
citizenry must assume the commitment through a moralization 
campaign to face the socioeconomic crisis we are enduring.

  [Text] Jaime Yoshiyama, president of the Democratic 
Constituent Congress [CCD], on 9 March expressed surprise at the 
CGTP petition to the United States to impose commercial 
sanctions against Peru. 
  Yoshiyama called on CGTP leaders to reconsider the issue and 
warned that our exports will be blockaded and exporters, 
workers, and the economy in general will be hurt if the United 
States imposes sanctions against our country. 
  "We must act seriously and keep in mind the defense of our 
national interests. Otherwise Peru might be excluded from the 
General System of Preferences and that would be very serious," 
Yoshiyama said. 
  The CCD president said human rights and the democratic 
system 
are respected in our country. 
  Referring to remarks made by congresswoman Martha Chavez 
(NM-C90 [New Majority-Change 90]), who characterized the CGTP 
petition as treason against the fatherland, Yoshiyama said the 
remarks expressed the legislator's mood and were her personal 
opinion on the damages that might cause eventual sanctions 
against our country. 
  The CCD president stressed that expressing an opinion is not 
a crime in Peru, adding that anyone can give his opinion freely. 
  The CGTP report to the United States is not a crime, even 
though it intends to hurt our country.

  [Text] Santiago, 14 Mar (EFE) -- During an interview 
published today by ESTRATEGIA, which specializes in the economy, 
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori asserted that Chile and Peru 
must remove "remnants of the past" and work toward a bilateral 
dialogue. 
  The Peruvian president, who was in Chile to attend the 
inauguration of President Eduardo Frei, said: "What we need is 
a bit more dialogue and communication and to cast away 
ultraconservatism and the arms race that have caused so much 
damage." 
  Fujimori said Peru has taken concrete steps to create a 
climate of confidence and has withdrawn "entire battalions" from 
the Chilean border. 
  He added: "I do not think border problems will prevent 
development between the two countries," and reiterated his 
government's will to negotiate an economic cooperation agreement 
with Chile. 
  During the interview Fujimori said: "I believe in the future 
of the integration process," and that in this sense concrete 
steps must be taken. "This would be a good step to be taken, 
and we are willing to do so now that there is a rapprochement 
with Chile at all levels." 
  According to Fujimori, the two countries can successfully 
complement each other in the agro-industrial and metallurgical 
fields. 
  During his stay in Santiago, Fujimori and Frei agreed to 
work 
on an economic cooperation agreement that will provide for 
actions in the investments field, and include custom tariff 
lists and telecommunications and transportation agreements. 
  Fujimori also disclosed that his country is interested and 
getting ready to join the Free Trade Agreement (TLC) with the 
United States. 
  In his opinion, "our economy now is quite open compared to 
that of other Latin American countries because we have made a 
lot progress... We believe that we soon will be fully 
competitive to join the major blocs." 
  Fujimori said his government's goals for this year are to 
reduce inflation to 25 percent and reach economic growth of more 
than 5 percent. The Peruvian president did not dismiss the 
possibility of running for reelection but asserted that he will 
make a decision in this regard next October.

  [Text] Lima, 11 Mar (EFE) -- Luis Caceres Velasquez -- 
former mayor of Arequipa, the second-largest city in Peru -- 
today announced his decision to run for the presidency of his 
country in the 1995 general elections as a candidate for the 
independent movement "Peru in the Year 2000" [Peru al 2000]. 
  Caceres is the first candidate to officially announce his 
intention to run for the presidency in next year's presidential 
and legislative electoral campaign. 
  The former mayor said he has several names to include on his 
list of congressional candidates and already has the name of two 
vice presidents who will run on his presidential ticket. He 
declined, however, to reveal their names. 
  He pointed out that everyone is entitled to become a 
candidate to govern the country and that he is not concerned 
about the possibility that President Alberto Fujimori, whom the 
Constitution allows to be reelected, and former UN Secretary 
General Javier Perez de Cuellar might decide to present their 
candidacies too. 
  Fujimori often has reiterated that he still has not thought 
about the possibility of running for reelection. Nonetheless, 
opposition members believe he surely will. Perez de Cuellar, 
however, has recently said it is still too early to decide on a 
possible candidacy. 
  Caceres Velasquez was mayor of Arequipa, 1,025 km south of 
Lima, for two consecutive terms. In the January 1993 municipal 
elections he was a candidate for mayor of Lima, but another 
independent candidate -- Ricardo Belmont -- won.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Economy and Finance Minister Jorge 
Garnet said he is revisiting the 1994 goals stated in the 
International Monetary Fund loan program for Peru to see if 
adjustments can be made that would allow more funds to be spent 
on fighting poverty. He also said that the planned $410 million 
for social programs in Peru's 1994 budget should be increased. 
The $410 million equates to only 1 percent of the GDP. Garnet 
said he will adopt a broad approach to finding monies, including 
applying for a larger portion of the income from privatizations. 
Last year's privatizations brought in $526 million and this 
year's sales of state enterprises are expected to yield $800 
million. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 18 Feb 94 p B11) 
  Seven private enterprises have been authorized to offer a 
full range of national and international postal services for the 
next five years as concessionaires. This is a direct result of a 
decree passed in 1991 that abolished the monopoly status of the 
Peruvian Directorate of Postal Services. The private firms had 
already been operating as courier services. (Lima EL COMERCIO in 
Spanish 16 Feb 94 p A8) 
  The new mortgage loan mechanism, which will be entirely in 
private hands, has prompted Vice Minister for Housing and 
Construction Fernando Ojeda Zanartu to speculate that it could 
attract $500 million and enable the construction of 50,000 homes 
this year. This view was echoed by Carlos G. Elias, vice 
president of the Peruvian Construction Association. They both 
anticipated that the mortgage system would attract investment by 
pension funds, banks, and insurance companies. (Lima EL COMERCIO 
in Spanish 9 Feb 94 p A9) 
  A new fishing vessel that is purported to be multipurpose, 
high-capacity, and low-cost has been developed in Peru. Its 
designer, Eduardo Rubini, said that the vessel, which has a 
steel hull, can carry 25 metric tons of fish and will allow for 
a constant harvest because it has equipment that will allow the 
fishermen to switch "from tuna to squid." The equipment allows 
for trawling, dragging, and line fishing, according to Rubini. 
The vessel is equipped to navigate by satellite, radar, and 
sonar probing, and costs "about the same as a bus," Rubini said. 
A total of 16 boats are planned. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 20 
Feb 94 p A13) 
  Of 5,000 fishing vessels registered in Peru, 60 percent are 
obsolete or no longer in use, according to Audberto Morales, 
head of the Institute for South Pacific Fishing Research. 
Morales pointed out that as a result, Peruvian fishermen only 
catch 104,000 metric tons of yellow jack tuna out of a biomass 
of 5 million metric tons, and similarly only catch 39,000 metric 
tons of mackerel out of a biomass of 1.3 million metric tons. He 
added that because of the age and poor condition of the fishing 
vessels, they spend "more time in repairs than on the job." 
(Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 20 Feb 94 p Al3)

Review" newscast] 
  [Text] With the alleged purpose of collectively defending 
democracy and promoting economic growth while advancing on a 
strategy of sustained development, the United States will hold a 
so-called Summit of the Americas in Miami, Florida. According 
to the official announcement made by President William Clinton 
himself, the meeting will be held in early December with the 
conspicuous absence of an invitation to the Cuban Government. 
  The meeting will call for the creation of a mechanism 
capable 
of promoting George Bush's so-called Initiative for the Americas 
which seeks to open new inroads for U.S. capital and for filling 
the gap that -- for obvious reasons -- the United States cannot 
fill by way of the Ibero-American Summits. Through a consensus 
of the participants, the three Ibero-American Summits reached 
common stands on certain issues based on mutual respect and the 
sovereign rights of each nation. By virtue of its own right and 
by invitation of the organizers, Cuba has attended these 
Ibero-American Summits. This has disturbed the power brokers in 
the United States who insist on isolating the Cuban Government. 
  The U.S. authorities are highlighting the fact that Cuba has 
been excluded from the Summit of the Americas guest list. No 
one should be deceived as to the not-so-secret purposes of 
giving the meeting a certain anti-Cuban flavor when economic 
issues of the utmost interest to Washington are scheduled to be 
discussed. We must not forget that challenges to maintaining 
the U.S. blockade against the island are growing in Congress, 
the executive branch, political institutions, the press, and 
other spheres of U.S. society. Those who advocate tightening 
the blockade do not like the steps taken by Cuba and its 
neighbors on the subcontinent to establish commercial ties that 
are mutually advantageous and encourage investments by Latin 
American entrepreneurs on the island. 
  The venue for the so-called Summit of the Americas is very 
suggestive. Naturally, one becomes very suspicious of the fact 
that the city of Miami was selected, because this is a city 
where extreme right-wing Cuban immigrants still control powerful 
media outlets. We will wait and see what the definite agenda of 
the Miami meeting, which will be discussed when Vice President 
Al Gore visits the region, will be. It will not be easy for him 
to find support for anti-Cuban maneuvers, if this is one of his 
goals.

  [Excerpt] The National Organization for the Defense of 
National Interests [ONIN], which came out publicly on 14 March, 
denounces the irresponsibility of Haitian leaders toward the 
crisis. The movement, which favors the lower chamber's plan, 
called on all the sectors of national life to reach a compromise 
for a solution to the crisis. 
  ONIN, which openly opposes foreign domination of the 
country's internal affairs, on 14 March launched a petition 
throughout the country seeking signatures to support the plan 
proposed by the deputies, a petition that the members of the 
organization intend to submit to Army Headquarters on 29 March, 
the anniversary date of the 1987 Constitution. The members of 
the National Organization for the Defense of National Interests 
met with the press on 14 March. [passage omitted]

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Panama City Telemetro Television Network 
in Spanish at 0200 GMT on 10 March, in its 30-minute "Challenge 
'94" program, broadcasts a live or recorded interview with 
presidential candidate Professor Ruben Dario Carles, first vice 
presidential candidate Guillermo Quijano, and second vice 
presidential candidate Dr. Tomas Herrera of Change '94, which 
comprises the Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement 
(Molirena), the Civic Renewal Party, and the National Renewal 
Movement (Morena). The interview is conducted by Dorita de 
Reyna at the Telemetro Television studios in Panama City; the 
date is not given. 
  Reyna begins by asking Carles what changes are endorsed by 
Change '94. In turn, Carles asks Quijano to answer, and Quijano 
replies: "Change '94 is a presidential ticket of men who are 
capable, dynamic, honest, and who have decided to give all of 
their administrative ability to creating employment and 
eradicating administrative corruption in Panama. This is what 
Change '94 stands for." 
  Reyna then asks Carles why, if he was indeed a man of 
influence in President Guillermo Endara's administration, he 
failed to do more over the past four years to help achieve these 
goals. Carles replies that he was merely the comptroller 
general and, as such, he could only give his opinion, because he 
had no true decisionmaking power. He says: "I was only the 
comptroller. I was not a minister or a president. But now, 
when you make me president, then I can be held accountable." 
  Reyna then asks Carles how he would rule without a majority 
in the Legislative Assembly. Carles replies: "The draft bills 
we intend to present will be so necessary and desirable that 
they will be approved, and my administration will be so 
exemplary that it will enjoy the cooperation of all legislators, 
because everyone will feel compelled to participate in such a 
good administration." 
  When Reyna notes that Carles is known for his unyielding 
positions and poor negotiating ability, Quijano intercedes and 
says he believes the new administration will create an 
atmosphere of teamwork, adding that the vice presidents will 
play an important role on the team. 
  Reyna asks Herrera what tasks appeal to him considering that 
vice presidents do not have specific roles. Herrera replies: 
"Allow me to say that the vice presidents will assist the 
president," adding that the vice presidents "will do whatever 
the president entrusts us to do." 
  Reyna asks Herrera how poverty can be reduced in a country 
where 50 percent of the population is considered poor and which 
still has an enormous foreign debt. Herrera replies: "For the 
time being I am not concerned... [pauses] It is not that the 
foreign debt does not concern me. It is true that this problem 
will affect several generations. The foreign debt cannot be 
repaid during one government term; this would be impossible. I 
must say that to resolve the unemployment problem we need to 
protect current job sources, both in the city and in the 
countryside, mainly to avoid a migration from the countryside 
into the cities." 
  Reyna asks about the ticket's plans to create jobs, to which 
Quijano replies that there are several programs and not enough 
time in the program to explain them. Nevertheless, he says one 
of the programs involves housing, adding that this program 
includes plans for the construction of 115,000 homes -- homes he 
dubs "housing solutions" -- which will in turn create 25,000 new 
jobs over a five-year period. 
  Quijano is interrupted by Reyna after he starts to explain 
plans for a reforestation program. Reyna asks whether the 
housing to be constructed by Change '94 will be for the poor, 
and Quijano replies: "The housing will be only and exclusively 
for the general population," and he adds that even the 
unemployed can participate through the "New Life" program, which 
makes "every family member jointly responsible for the debt." 
He adds: "Even people who have no regular income can either 
receive a home improvement loan or a small house to start a new 
life with hope and optimism for the future. This is our 
philosophical concept." 
  Herrera adds: "Of course, there are other programs, such as 
incentives for private investment programs. Jobs can only be 
created through private investment incentives." 
  Reyna then broaches the problem of law and order, and she 
asks how Panama can be attractive to investors if the country 
has so many security problems. Herrera replies: "You are 
referring to a public service issue. Let me tell you that all 
public services have to be improved. If public services do not 
work -- and this includes electricity, water, security, 
transportation, streets, and so on -- the country cannot be 
attractive to investors. The idea is to make public 
administration efficient, and when we speak of making it 
efficient, we are also speaking of efficient public services 
that will enable businesses to rest assured that they will have 
dependable and inexpensive public services. All of this is part 
of an environment that attracts private entrepreneurs. In 
addition, we will have an honest government, and there will be 
complete honesty in administering public funds. Those investors 
who come to the country to invest will know that no one will 
demand a bribe or a hidden commission, because there is a 
presidential commitment to avoid such things." 
  Reyna quizzes Carles on alleged cases of looking the other 
way when other people in the government have not been entirely 
honest. Carles says that in all cases that come to his 
attention, the people involved were dismissed and that many of 
these cases are still pending in the Attorney General's Office. 
  Reyna then switches to the topic of U.S. bases and asks 
Carles about his public stand on the appropriateness of 
renegotiating the status of U.S. bases in Panama and whether it 
would not be more profitable for Panama to properly use these 
reverted areas. Carles replies: "Well, this is a matter of 
priorities. We have already had a great number of properties 
returned and to the present we have not used them. In a few 
years, we will be receiving a great deal more. We cannot receive 
them all, simultaneously, without using them. We need to 
establish with some sort of priority what areas we should 
dedicate to certain uses and what areas we can allow to continue 
to be used as they are being used now while we have other 
options. It is a question of prioritizing time." 
  Reyna then asks Quijano to explain how their government plan 
deals with this question. Quijano replies: "Our priority is 
jobs. Right now, we cannot let 14,000 or 15,000 families lose 
their jobs with the closure of U.S. bases in Panama. We have 
enough reverted areas to start modernizing the economy through a 
maritime center in these reverted areas. The question of 
modifying the U.S. bases lease can then be dealt with slowly but 
surely by future administrations. Right now, however, we need to 
protect the thousands of Panamanians who today earn their living 
honestly in the bases in Panama." 
  Reyna switches the subject to privatization. She asks Carles 
if privatization is part of the Change '94 plans and he replies 
that not everything should be privatized. When she asks what 
should, Carles replied: "We must privatize the railroad, and I 
will tell you something else. Panama still does not have 
cellular telephones. This is something that needs to be 
privatized." Reyna interjects and asks whether this means 
privatizing INTEL, National Institute of Telecommunications, or 
the cellular telephone service. Carles replies: "The cellular 
telephone service." Reyna reminds Carles that all along he has 
favored privatizing INTEL. Carles replies: "There are other 
INTEL services that could be privatized. We should not be afraid 
to privatize; we must look for good areas that can be 
privatized. Before I forget, I want to quickly tell you about 
the debt. As Comptroller General, I never had anything to do 
with the handling of the public debt. This was the 
responsibility of others. Regarding the commercial bank debt, I 
have never favored the Panamanian Government hastily beginning 
negotiations with commercial banks. I have always said it. It is 
very clear in the minutes I took, where I say that we need to 
negotiate the best option among the various alternatives that do 
not interfere with the work of the state and do not affect 
public services, especially those of a social nature. We must 
grow first and pay the debt after. Let it be very clear, there 
are others who are in a hurry to pay the debt. I have said this 
must go to the end of the line." 
  Herrera stresses the need to remember who created the debt 
in 
the first place and proceeds to quote figures of what it was in 
1968, when the military coup took place, and of the situation on 
20 December 1989, the date of the invasion and end of the 
dictatorship. 
  Quijano stresses Molirena's support for Carles and denies a 
suggestive question by Reyna that a certain amount of coercion 
was needed before Molirena agreed to support Carles instead of 
Guillermo Ford. 
  Reyna asks Carles whether he would be willing to govern by 
consensus, including parties that may have opposed him. Carles 
replies: "I have not made any pacts with anyone and I have not 
assigned political opportunities to anyone. I am going to choose 
the people who can best serve the country."

  [Text] U.S. Ambassador James Cheek on 14 March said that on 
21 March U.S. Vice President Al Gore will propose to President 
Carlos Menem the need for Congress to pass a law creating the 
status of repentant within a group of new legal weapons against 
drug trafficking. Cheek thus confirmed what was reported by 
CLARIN on 14 March. 
  In order that Gore's proposal not sound like diplomatic 
pressure, Secretary for the Prevention of Drug Abuse Alberto 
Lestelle said "it is very probable" that Gore and President 
Menem will discuss this sensitive subject. "There is absolute 
coordination between Argentina and the United States on this 
subject," Lestelle pointed out. 
  During a news conference on 14 March to report on Gore's 
agenda here, Cheek said the "United States has been suggesting 
and endorsing the laws approved by Congress that, I understand, 
are supported by the Argentine Government and the majority of 
Congress." 
  In order to clarify any doubt, the U.S. ambassador added: 
"We have stressed the need for the approval of these laws in 
order to give the Argentine Government the necessary 
cooperation." In this manner, Cheek referred to the draft bills 
that create the status of repentant, informer, undercover agent, 
and controlled delivery of drug shipments, which the powerful 
DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) demands to make the struggle 
against drug trafficking in our country "more efficient." DEA 
experts believe that with these new laws drug traffickers can be 
fought "more efficiently." 
  Besides asking to approve these laws, Washington also wants 
the military to give their logistical support to the security 
forces in this struggle, although it understands that "for the 
time being" it is not necessary. U.S. Antinarcotics Under 
Secretary Robert Gelbard [title as published] last week gave 
signals about these two subjects to officials from the Argentine 
Foreign and Interior Ministries and the Secretariat for the 
Prevention of Drug Abuse. 
  Following a ceremony in the Communications Secretariat 
headed 
by Oscar Gonzalez, Ambassador Cheek referred to the U.S. 
interest in the approval of a law including, among other 
subjects, the status of repentant. 
  The U.S. concern over these laws began to be expressed 
mainly 
after the Mar del Plata Penal Court for Economic Crimes released 
Colombian John Arroyave Arias, who was involved in the Shrimp 
Operation. 
  After learning about Cheek's statements, Lestelle said he 
believes the draft bill he sent to Congress 20 days ago "will be 
approved before the end of the year, if the congressmen decide 
so." 
  Lestelle added: "We rejected a draft bill approved by the 
lower house because it lacks the status of repentant." 
  Radical Civic Union [UCR] congressmen nonetheless unleashed 
a 
storm. UCR Deputy Gaston Ortiz Maldonado, vice president of the 
Chamber of Deputies Drug Addiction Committee, labeled Lestelle's 
decision to send a new draft bill to Congress as "untimely" 
given that the lower house already had approved a bill he 
himself drafted.

<F P=106> [News conference granted by President Eduardo Frei Tagle to </F>
local and foreign journalists at La Moneda Palace on 13 March, 
moderated by unidentified government official -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Moderator] Manuel Maria Mesiger, of Madrid EFE. 
  [Mesiger] Mr. President, among the pending issues inherited 
from the previous government are human rights, political reform, 
and border conflict. Which do you regard as the most difficult 
and which will you tackle first? 
  [Frei] Are you referring in general or to problems with a 
specific country? 
  [Mesiger] In general. 
  [Frei] Well, in general, I believe that all of the issues 
you 
have mentioned are important. Human rights, border conflicts, 
well, I do not think any has precedence over the others. The 
subjects are quite varied because with border conflicts, for 
example, we have made various degrees of progress with bordering 
countries. We have made considerable progress during the past 
years and will continue to do so. As for human rights, one of 
the key and priority issues -- and the handling of this subject 
was one of the achievements of President Aylwin's government -- 
as our government program states and according to our moral 
beliefs, is that it is an unavoidable subject in a democracy 
like ours. The human rights issue will be contemplated in all 
our government actions -- that is, in the amending or 
improvement of our laws -- as will field of education and 
respect for all international treaties on the issue. I believe 
I already said this is my speech last night, but Chile has a 
tradition in the human rights field that we will consolidate and 
strengthen. 
  [Moderator] Pilar Rodriguez, Megavision. 
  [Rodriguez] Mr. President. One criticism of the previous 
administration was that it was not firm enough against cases of 
corruption. You, however, said yesterday you would be very firm 
in this regard. I would like to know if your firmness will 
prevail over the political cost it may represent for the 
political parties that support you. 
  [Frei] First, corruption in the public administration is a 
problem that currently plagues any modern society. We know of 
several governments that have been ousted due to corruption in 
the political system. Chile is not immune to these dangers. We 
are not an island in the world. We have clearly stated that 
Chile has never been plagued by generalized corruption, there 
have been some irregular actions, but I absolutely agree with 
the measures taken by President Aylwin's government on the 
subject, such as the case of Codelco [Copper Corporation] right 
from the start. We want to reassert the necessary firmness with 
which a government must act in this regard. It is not just a 
question of making amendments or the use of legal tools, it is a 
subject we can discuss with the opposition because it is a 
national issue. As I stated last night, it is a matter of 
attitude of the government servants. I want to establish a line 
to be followed, as I stated last night, and I will follow it 
right from the beginning and will demand that it be followed by 
all my aides, be they mayors, governors, heads of services, or 
representatives of public enterprises, etc. The entire state 
apparatus. We will act firmly because we are aware that when 
corruption sets in it is very difficult to eradicate. We will 
act with firmness, no matter the political cost it may represent. 
  [Rodriguez] Even if this means dismissing servants guilty of 
corruption. 
  [Frei] Definitely. I will not hesitate. We must act... 
[pauses]... I think I have already proven this in some cases 
before assuming the presidency. [passage omitted] 
  [Moderator] Carlos Briones, Deutsche Welle. 
  [Briones] Mr. President. Not long ago in Valdivia, two 
outstanding Latin American geopolitical experts -- General 
(Augustin Toro Davila), Chilean, and General (Edgardo Mercado 
Jarin) -- pointed out the need for regional integration. The 
fact that two geopolitical experts made such a remark took 
people by surprise. I would like to now what line your 
government will follow, especially regarding what has been 
called the mega-project? 
  [Frei] Are we referring to Latin American regional 
integration? 
  [Briones] Yes. 
  [Frei] The Chilean economy is currently open to the world. 
Our priorities lie in the rest of the world. During the past 
few years, practically one third of Chilean exports went to 
Pacific Asia, one third to the American continent, and the other 
third to the European Union. This has gradually changed during 
the past years and now practically one fourth of our relations 
are with Latin America. Therefore, without forgetting the 
Chilean presence in the markets, this is reflected by our 
participation in APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation] -- 
within a few days, next week to be precise, the finance minister 
will attend an APEC meeting. This will be the first time our 
finance minister has officially attended an APEC finance 
ministers meeting. By the end of the year, in Indonesia, we 
hope to fully participate in this organization. At the same 
time we are also present in the U.S. market. Everyone is aware 
of our viewpoint regarding free trade agreements and NAFTA. We 
are also continuing to strengthen our relationship with Europe, 
the European Union, that has been a traditional Chilean friend 
in all fields -- and from where our cultural roots and 
civilization come. 
  Without neglecting all I have just mentioned, we want to 
place special emphasis on Latin American integration. I said 
this in my speech yesterday, we also discussed the subject 
during the luncheon on 11 March with the visiting presidents. 
Chile has cooperation agreements with practically every Latin 
American country, with the sole exception of three countries 
with which we are working on the issue. We do not only want to 
work on the economic, commercial, and political aspects of the 
integration of our nations, we also want to work on the 
educational aspect. I have already informed the visiting 
presidents that there is a UNESCO program, sponsored by the UN 
Development Program, to begin deep-rooted changes in the 
education, culture, learning, and teaching program for our 
people. We want to carry out this program in the next few years 
with other Latin American countries. This is our neighborhood, 
our environment, where we share similar culture, a language, and 
I think there is still a lot to be done in this field. This 
development will allow us to compete in the great world groups 
and to improve the living standards of our people. In Chile's 
case, this significant increase in our commercial relations with 
Latin American countries mostly involves manufactured goods, not 
just raw materials as in the case of our relations with the 
great powers. Therefore, we are going to place special emphasis 
in this field. We are also talking about what has been called 
open regionalism, which does not seek agreements that will close 
Latin American doors to the rest of the world, but rather opens 
them to the world community. 
  [Moderator] Maria Jose Errazuriz, EL MERCURIO. 
  [Errazuriz] Mr. President, when you were choosing the 
members 
of you cabinet, the Socialist Party complained about a lack of 
communication with you and later talked about the need to 
establish the new role for the member parties of the Coalition 
of Parties for Democracy [CPPD] under your government. What role 
will you give the CPPD member parties during your administration 
and do you think this is the end of coalition as Senator Adolfo 
Zaldivar stated? 
  [Frei] I am just starting my presidential term. During the 
campaign and these past few days I have without doubt maintained 
an incredibly fluid relationship with the CPPD member parties. 
We are working with them, we have exchanged views, we have a 
government program, we must continue working united and this is 
what we are going to do. The situation of each party is, 
obviously, different from what it was in 1989. The parties are 
now more consolidated and organized. Together with the 
ministers of the political sector we have established a strategy 
and modus operandi to work with the parties throughout my 
administration. 
  As for the coalition, as I stated last night, I believe the 
president's authority plays an important role. All member 
parties fully respect presidential decisions. Obviously, when 
you have to elect 300, 400, 500, 600 government servants there 
will always be someone not satisfied with the appointment. I 
feel that my appointments have taken into account the political 
balance and also respected excellence and the presence of the 
various Chilean personalities. We will continue to work on this 
with the political parties. 
  [Moderator] Luis Alvarez, REUTERS. 
  [Alvarez] Mr. President, I want to ask a question that may 
sound rather repetitive. General [Augusto] Pinochet continues 
to be controversial abroad and each time you were asked about 
him, in your capacity as candidate and president-elect, you said 
you would state your position regarding his presence as Army 
commander after assuming the presidency. Although principles 
are involved, I would like to know whether you, as President 
Aylwin did at the beginning of his mandate, will ask Pinochet to 
step down as Army commander because there is no reason for him 
to continue in that post. 
  [Frei] The situation is quite clear. The commanders of the 
Armed Forces, who assumed their posts shortly before President 
Aylwin assumed the presidency -- according to the law and the 
Constitution -- have the right to remain in their posts until 
1997. I will respect the Constitution and the laws and, as we 
have always stated, work to reach a consensus so that future 
Chilean presidents will recover their authority to appoint the 
Armed Forces commanders. This is the case in every world 
democracy and this is a principle we will always uphold. As I 
said last night, relationships in a state situation must be 
impersonal. This is not a matter of personal choice, it is a 
matter of impersonal relations within a state and we will work 
on this guideline with the Armed Forces. Since I assumed this 
position, our relationship has been incredibly fluid and we will 
discuss the great subjects and the role the Armed Forces must 
play in Chile after the year 2000. 
  [Moderator] Pablo Honorado, Channel 13 Television. 
  [Honorado] Mr. President, just before ending his mandate, 
Former President Aylwin pardoned some individuals sentenced to 
life for the attack on General Pinochet's motorcade during which 
five of his bodyguards died. Yesterday Pinochet said he was 
upset by the decision but that he respected it because it was 
the president's prerogative. Right now there are some 70 
prisoners charged with terrorist attacks. You have the 
prerogative to pardon them. Will you do so if they request it? 
  [Frei] There is no policy established for pardoning 
prisoners. I respect, have respected, and will continue to 
respect and support all of President Aylwin's decisions. It is 
a prerogative granted to the president by the Constitution and 
the law and, in this specific case, it was a prerogative granted 
him by Congress through an initiative of the opposition. I 
reiterate, there is no policy on the subject. It is a case by 
case decision. Each case must be assessed and exhaustively 
studied separately. This is the way I will handle the subject. 
  [Moderator] Veronica Munoz, Radio Nacional. 
  [Munoz] President Frei, police actions -- in practice not in 
theory -- during arrests, hold ups, and demonstrations 
throughout Aylwin's administration were strongly criticized. 
What does your government intend to do to avoid abuses that, 
unavoidably, represent violations of human rights? 
  [Frei] As I stated at the beginning, our government will 
always respect human rights, but we are also going to clearly 
respect the authority, laws, as well as the police institutions. 
Anarchy begins when there is no authority and, therefore, you 
can only follow one single guideline in this regard. It is up 
to the court to pass judgment on cases of violations of human 
rights or abuse. We will clearly respect human rights, the 
Constitution, the law, the legal procedures established by the 
various institutions to safeguard public order and, thus, avoid 
any sign of violence or terrorism in our society. 
  [Moderator] Ted Cordoba, Bolivian daily ULTIMA HORA. 
  [Cordoba] Regarding your interest in trade with neighboring 
countries and regional integration, there are currently two 
great projects: One is already underway between Bolivia and 
Peru in the port of Ilo, and the other is a project you have in 
mind to establish a development center in Arica. My first 
question is, if the three countries regard these as competitive 
projects, could they not establish a great port between Ilo and 
Arica that will benefit the entire Latin American continent, 
including Brazil, on the Pacific? My second question is: Please 
expand your comment that following the visit to Chile of Ximena 
Sanchez de Lozada [the Bolivian president's wife] there will be 
talks on Bolivia's landlocked situation. 
  [Frei] Thank you for your question because, first, I want to 
thank the Bolivian president for his gesture of asking his wife 
to attend the presidential inauguration ceremony as an 
expression of friendship -- not just with me but with the entire 
Chilean people. We will continue to work on this subject, we 
will enhance the significant progress we have already made. 
Last October, during the meeting of the Rio Group, I had a long 
chat with Bolivian President [Gonzalo] Sanchez de Lozada. We 
discussed how to progress in every field of common interest. 
There are many cooperation and infrastructure projects. With 
determination and courage we will progress in these fields. I 
want to paraphrase what President Sanchez de Lozada said when he 
visited Chile: We will help Bolivia join the world. All the 
projects you have mentioned fit in here. We have infrastructure 
projects underway, we are building highways, we must improve our 
railway services, and we must continue to progress in the 
bioceanic integration route. In Northern Chile we have two or 
three alternatives, we have others in Central Chile, and during 
our chats over these past days with the visiting presidents, 
especially with the Uruguayan president, we discussed the 
possibility of establishing bioceanic routes, a tunnel, etc. We 
have a great number of alternatives to improve physical 
investments that will contribute to the integration of our 
countries. We can make a lot of progress and we have the 
commitment and approval of our governments and people to do so. 
  [Moderator] Jose Miguel Alfaro. Television Nacional de 
Chile. 
  [Alfaro] Mr. President, you said yesterday that Chile is a 
reconciled country. Yet there are numerous cases of violation 
of human rights during the military regime that remain 
unclarified and unjudged. What do you propose so that those 
Chileans who still pine for their loved ones who were lost under 
the military regime may, some day, with their mind in peace 
shake hands, and look the military men -- who still do not admit 
their crimes -- in the eye. 
  [Frei] One of the great achievements and successes of 
President Aylwin's government has been to progress in national 
reconciliation. This was his priority task, as he mentioned in 
this first speech at the National Stadium when he assumed the 
presidency. This has been reflected in many initiatives -- 
starting with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and 
followed by a series of legal initiatives regarding reparation 
for the victims -- about which we are all aware. Truth and 
justice must never be yield in this regard. It is an unwavering 
path. We can now say we know the truth but we can also say that 
there are still cases for which justice has not been 
implemented. My government will support and cooperate, with all 
our effort and dedication, to enable the courts to conclude 
outstanding cases, establish the truth, and implement justice. 
This is necessary to complete Chile's reconciliation process. 
I would like to quote from [Santiago Bishop] Msgr. Oviedo's 
sermon yesterday, which was greatly commentated and applauded by 
all Chilean sectors. He said, quote, without an inner decision 
to reach reconciliation, no political or administrative power 
can make it happen. Moreover, without efficient courts that 
recognizes each and everyone's dignity, this inner decision will 
falter and die. We must continue to tread on the chosen path 
without risking all we have achieved so far, unquote. I feel 
this phrase reflects the current feeling. 
  [Alfaro] Does your government have a concrete initiative, a 
specific gesture, for concluding pending cases? 
  [Frei] Well, once we settle in, the new justice minister 
will 
contact the Supreme Court to cooperate and seek all mechanisms 
to speed up these cases. [passage omitted] 
  [Moderator] Orlando Milessi, ANSA. 
  [Milessi] Mr. President, one of the concrete objectives of 
your program is to fight extreme poverty. It has been said that 
about 1 million Chileans will have been pulled out extreme 
poverty by the end of your government. You said yesterday it 
was time to end the rhetoric regarding poverty, about which so 
much has been said. How do you propose to fight extreme 
poverty? Where will you obtain the funds for this? Why was 
nothing said about the crusade against poverty? 
  [Frei] Well, as you know one of the priorities of our 
government is to fight poverty. We believe it was a priority of 
the Aylwin government, and that great progress was made in this 
field. In early 1990 an agreement on tax reform was reached 
which provided additional income to fight poverty. This tax 
reform was renewed last year thus allowing us to fight poverty 
without causing a fiscal deficit, inflation, or upset the 
macroeconomic balance. Regarding specific actions, first I will 
preside over the social intraministry committee to fight 
poverty. I will personally preside over this committee. I have 
been working on this project with the ministers of the area to 
come up with concrete proposal. We believe this subject is of 
national importance and, therefore, are will invite private 
sector organizations, like the Hogar de Cristo and similar 
organizations that are in permanent contact with the poorest 
sectors. We will invite all nongovernment organizations, the 
commercial and production sectors, etc., and all Chilean sectors 
because we believe this is a priority national issue. We will 
permanently emphasize this subject and I believe that -- more 
than just talking -- we need to know what to do, how to do what 
is necessary, how to make the state apparatus more efficient, 
how to control expenditures and investments in the poor sectors 
and ensure they reach the people. Many times the money gets 
never reaches its final destination due to the excessive red 
tape, etc. We will work on this right from the beginning with 
decisions and efforts of the entire state apparatus. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Moderator] Persio Dalvel, Concepcion daily EL SUR. 
  [Dalvel] Mr. President. You have expressed the need to give 
preferential treatment to the poverty problem. How do you 
ratify that priority with the recent purchase of weapons for the 
Army and the belief that the Armed Forces must be constantly 
modernized? 
  [Frei] I firmly believe that there is no arms race nor that 
the Chilean Armed Forces are purchasing new equipment. They are 
merely replacing very ancient equipment. For example, the 
Chilean Air Force wants to replace its Hawker Hunter planes that 
are 25-30 years old and are no longer operational. We want our 
Armed Forces to safeguard the country's integrity. Chile does 
not have a bellicose attitude. We uphold peace and the 
purchases Chile makes fall within that context: To protect our 
territorial integrity and sovereignty. We will continue to work 
in this direction. I do not see our struggle against poverty as 
incompatible with an Armed Forces capable of responding to this 
criteria which, as I have already said, is not bellicose but 
rather for peace. [passage omitted] 
  [Moderator] Daniel Mazzone, EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO, of 
Uruguay. 
  [Mazzone] Mr. President, you have just spoken of your 
meetings with presidents of other countries, and you mentioned 
Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle. He has said the 
agenda included a highway that will cross Brazil down to Colonia 
[Uruguay] and across the Colonia-Buenos Aires bridge. President 
Lacalle proposes that the highway reaches Chile, thus giving 
Chilean products access to the Atlantic. I would like to know 
Chilean expectations in this regard, and if there are any 
chances for the project. 
  [Frei] The bioceanic highway is a high priority in various 
Chilean regions. During my campaign I was involved in several 
conversations, even major meetings, that addressed this subject 
in northern Chile last year. 
  Our country extends more than 4,000 km. In each region I was 
asked for connection with Argentina, Bolivia, and other 
neighboring countries. 
  These countries have their priorities about the routes to be 
chosen. I attended a meeting in Iquique, for example, with 
delegations of governors and mayors of southern Peru, Bolivia, 
northern Argentina, Brazil, and even Uruguay, during which the 
priorities on this subject were discussed. 
  Consequently, we cannot meet all of the demands and 
implement 
all of the initiatives. We have priorities and we will analyze 
them from the viewpoint of Chile, to see how private investment 
can participate in those projects, because they are large 
projects. Chile has a law permitting concessions and the 
participation of the private sector in the construction of 
infrastructure. 
  President Lacalle and I talked about this bioceanic highway, 
which in the case of Chile would require not only a study but 
construction of a bridge that could operate all year round, 
according to our current flow of passenger and cargo. This 
deeply interests us and will receive careful consideration. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Moderator] Ana Maria Ojeda, daily LA NACION. 
  [Ojeda] Mr. President, when you disclosed the members of 
your 
cabinet, you named former Senator Mario Papi as coordinator 
between the Legislative and Executive Branches. I would like to 
known what specific functions do you have in mind for him? 
  [Frei] The functions for former Senator Papi are not 
functions for former Senator Papi. The debate has become 
personalized. I am not seeking a post for former Senator Papi, 
nor am I seeking a post for social democrats. I am creating a 
post I deem necessary. Why? Because I was a member of Congress 
and know what Congress is all about. I believe a fluid 
relationship between the president of the Republic and the 
legislators is very necessary. During the past few days I met 
with practically all legislators and explained to them why I 
created this post. We will establish the legal status of this 
post, but he will work with me. He is working to establish a 
fluid an permanent relationship between the president of the 
Republic and more than 167 legislators. I want legislators to 
be in permanent contact with the president, I want to maintain a 
fluid relationship with them. I have experienced Congress and 
believe this function is very important. Everyone agrees and in 
the next few days we will establish the legal status for this 
post. As of tomorrow Mario Papi will be doing this job which I 
regard as essential. [passage omitted] 
  [Moderator] Guillermo Espinoza, Chilean daily EL SIGLO. 
  [Espinoza] Mr. President, I would like to know if your role 
as commander of the Armed Forces, and the Armed Forces role as 
guarantors of institutional order -- as stated in the 
Constitution -- are compatible. If not, what can be done to 
solve this problem? 
  [Frei] In my speech last night, I clearly stated I will be 
president of all Chileans and the head of the Armed Forces as a 
symbol of national unity. Article No. 32 of the Constitution, 
Clauses 18 to 22 or 17 to 20 I think, list the duties and powers 
of the president of the Republic. They are also mentioned in 
other parts of the Constitution. I will follow these 
guidelines. There are some legal and constitutional amendments 
that I consider necessary so that these articles may be fully 
implemented. For example, in the case of the appointment of the 
commanders in chief, one article establishes that the president 
is empowered to remove the commanders in chief and also has a 
say in the promotion and retirement of Armed Forces members. 
There are, however, other articles complementing this specific 
article which prevent the president from exercising that power. 
As I have stated before, we will continue to work on this 
because we believe it is part of the effort to fully implement 
democracy and what is the case in Chile today: to have the 
president of the Republic fully respected, to have the Armed 
Forces subordinated to the political power that has been 
democratically elected by the people, and to have the government 
respect the professional and nondeliberative role of the Armed 
Forces. Our relations are, and will be, based on this. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Pilar Barrera: "Summit and Peace </F>
Pact Among the Mafia"] 
  [Text] On Friday, 11 February, traffickers and spokesmen 
from the most powerful Mafia in Antioquia, Valle, and the Coast 
held a summit meeting to sign the document for the new peace 
among the Mafia. 
  After seven years of a bloody war, with hundreds of dynamite 
attacks on Down With Drugs headquarters, selective massacres, 
and the creation of Persecuted by Pablo Escobar (Pepes), the 
traffickers leading the Mafia vendettas decided to sit down at 
the same table. 
  In Valle, protected by clandestinity, those claiming to be 
authorized spokesmen for the most powerful organizations in the 
country gathered for the first time. 
  In other words, they were representatives claiming to be 
acting directly on behalf of the brothers Gilberto and Miguel 
Rodriguez Orejuela, Jose Santacruz Londono, William Ortiz 
("Miky"), and Salomon Camacho, for the Valle traffickers; Carlos 
Castano, brother of Fidel ("Rambo"), for a branch of the 
Medellin Cartel; and two lawyers and a pregnant woman, on behalf 
of the Escobars and Escobar's ex-terrorist chiefs confined in 
prison. 
  The terms of the agreement include several concrete, 
compulsory demands upon the Medellin Cartel strongholds. 
  Initially, Pablo Escobar's survivors must retract the 
accusations linking Fidel and Carlos Castano with the brutal 
attack on the Avianca airplane that occurred during December 
1989, with a toll of 111 fatalities. 
  At the same time, Carlos Mario Alzate Urquijo ("Arete") and 
other Escobar ex-terrorist chiefs now in prison must secure 
Julio Mamey's appearance before the Prosecutor General's Office. 
  According to the statements made at the summit, Mamey fled 
to 
North America after the attack of 28 July 1989 that ended the 
life of Antioquia's governor, Antonio Roldan Betancur. 
  The Castanos and the top-ranking Valle traffickers believe 
Mamey to be the only one who could reveal to the Prosecutor 
General's Office the way in which the murder was planned, and 
the steps taken, at Pablo Escobar's order, to make the car bomb 
explosion that took Roldan's life appear as a murder committed 
by Jose Santacruz Londono. 
  "Arete" and other convicted members of the Medellin Cartel 
must require the liaisons who are at large to appear before the 
Prosecutor General's Office, to confess all their crimes, and to 
submit to the prison sentences imposed on them. 
  In particular, the Valle traffickers believe that their 
former archenemies must surrender Juan Rios, an Escobar 
ringleader known by the nickname "La Chepa [The Hump]." 
  The Cali traffickers accuse "La Chepa" of being the 
contriver 
of the principal massacres in Valle. They include, among others, 
the one that occurred on 25 September 1990 on a farm in the 
municipality of Candelaria (Valle), in which 27 persons were 
killed and several of the Cali Cartel's "capi di capi [top 
bosses]" escaped fortuitously. 
<H5>  Other Demands </H5>
  The police have indications that Elmer Herrera ("Pacho 
Herrera") himself escaped from the gory incident by hiding in an 
official car. 
  Finally, the Valle "narcos" and their Antioquian allies from 
the Castanos' sector demand that Pablo Escobar's former aides 
revise the charges that they have made against them in the 
investigations being conducted by the Prosecutor General's 
Office. 
  Among other claims, the Medellin traffickers would have to 
retract the names that they have given to the Prosecutor 
General's Office of presumed members of the "Pepes," beginning 
with Castano. 
  A source explained to EL TIEMPO: "The fact is that whoever 
wins will impose the conditions." 
  An additional point is that the Escobar family, or those 
left 
with his fortune, must make reparation for the harm inflicted on 
the victims of the Mafia war. 
  An authorized source explained to EL TIEMPO: "These points 
are recorded in a document, initially signed by the participants 
in the Cali summit, that is circulating in the Itagui, La 
Picota, and La Modelo jails." 
  According to the same source, "Arete," Jhon Jairo Velasquez 
Vasquez, ("Popeye"), and Carlos Aguilar Gallego ("El Mugre") 
have already signed the document. 
  The negotiation process among the cartels began brewing two 
months ago, just 15 days after the Search Bloc located and 
confronted Pablo Escobar at a residence located west of 
Medellin, on 2 December. 
  As EL TIEMPO published in its 6 February edition, at Itagui, 
La Modelo, and La Picota there was a preliminary agreement among 
the Medellin Cartel convicts to start the search for a peace 
alliance with their Valle enemies and with the one said to be 
the head of "Persecuted by Pablo Escobar," Fidel Castano. 
  An incognito ex-prosecutor, Enrique Mancera, the attorney 
who 
attempted to take the Escobar family out of the country, was 
located to act as spokesman for the Medellin convicts. 
  Even Pablo Escobar's wife, Maria Victoria Henao, and their 
son, Juan Pablo, have been involved in the negotiations. 
  Days before the summit among the Mafia spokesmen, Maria 
Victoria and her son visited Escobar's former allies at La 
Picota, on behalf of the search for peace. 
  At the same time, various documents reveal the internal 
crisis among Escobar's former allies. 
<H5>  Peace </H5>
  During a conversation between two prominent Escobar 
ex-agents, regarding the need for sending spokesmen to negotiate 
peace with the Cali Cartel, the first of them warned the other: 
"I tell you one thing, cool guy, we'll have to kneel here (...), 
or they'll kill us all; and we must at least see to it that the 
families live...." 
  Last Wednesday, after the summit among the "capos'" 
spokesmen 
in Valle, and at the request for an expansion of the 
investigation, "Arete" and "El Mugre" met in one of the rooms at 
the Prosecutor General's Office with two lawyers for the Cali 
Cartel and its representatives. 
  High-ranking spokesmen for the Prosecutor General's Office 
explained that this was no meeting, but rather a hearing on 
expansion of the investigation. However, EL TIEMPO spoke with 
attendees at the meeting, who claimed that "Arete" and "El 
Mugre" had talked for at least three hours with the Valle 
traffickers' spokesmen, one of them a man identified as 
Guillermo Angel. 
  The sources said that an incognito female prosecutor with 
the 
surname Aguilar was an exceptional witness at those talks, 
adding: "The regional director of Prosecutors' Offices in 
Bogota, Jorge Enrique Bautista, was also present for a short 
time." 
  They noted: "Meanwhile, Ana Montes, national director of 
Prosecutors' Offices, was waiting for the results of the meeting 
in another room." 
  As was reported, both "Arete" and "El Mugre" expressed their 
intention of ceasing the quarrels. "We are tired of fighting," 
they told the Cali Cartel representatives. 
  During the meeting, which lasted seven hours, between 1000 
and 1700, Pablo Escobar's men declared that they want to change 
their lives, that they need to get ahead, and that they want to 
be allowed to live calmly. 
  Also proposed was the need for helping many young criminals 
to give up their weapons.

  [Text] The commander of the 3d Brigade headquartered in 
[Cali], General Rafael Hernandez Lopez, said yesterday that over 
the past six months raids have been carried out in northern, 
central, and southern Valle del Cauca Department, zones where 
members of the so-called Cali Cartel operate. 
  "We have been carrying out four or five raids each day in 
all 
those sectors where we believe there are presumed drug 
traffickers or subversives. What is happening is that now we 
have intensified them because the intelligence has improved," he 
added. 
  According to the general, 11 raids were carried out in Cali 
yesterday, seven in Palmira, four in Buga, and some others in 
Popayan and adjoining areas. 
  He added that in the course of these raids they have seized 
property, and vehicles, and have entered ranches and houses, but 
so far no individuals have been arrested. 
  In Ciudad Jardin neighborhood, in southern Cali, in the past 
few days various raids have been carried out in which 
authorities found a building under construction which contained 
a jacuzzi, gymnasiums, a sauna, and other luxuries. 
  The identity of the owners and the origin of the money 
invested in that building are a mystery, and the authorities 
decided to open an investigation to determine the identity of 
the owners. 
  Other sources revealed that among the property seized are 
armor-plated vehicles, one of which belongs to Fernando Tello 
Dorronsoro, a Liberal member of the House of Representatives 
running for reelection in Valle. 
  Spokespersons for the Prosecutor General's Office said that 
the vehicle was seized during the raid of a residence presumed 
to belong to former beauty queen Martha Lucia Echeverri. 
  With regard to several media reports on Thursday night [24 
February] that one of the operations was on the verge of 
capturing an important Cali Cartel leader, Gen. Hernandez said 
it was false. 
  In addition, he said that all of confiscated items as well 
as 
"important documents which were being analyzed" will be turned 
over to the Regional Prosecutor General's Office which is 
conducting the investigation. 
<H5>  A Strike in Bogota </H5>
  In other news, a band of criminals which supposedly tried to 
sell information processing equipment to the Cali Cartel was 
dismantled last Thursday in Bogota by the Judicial and 
Investigative Police whose units captured four of the members. 
  The operation took place at the intersection of calle 60 and 
highway 17, in the Chapiero district, and the following items 
were seized: 47 Minitelt data processing units (video, textual), 
four Hewlett Packard monitors; sixty cartridges of various 
calibers, and one piece of sound equipment. 
  According to preliminary investigations, the subjects had 
contacts with the above-mentioned drug trafficking group and 
their activities were discovered by an undercover agent and 
through laborious intelligence work. 
  The four arrested were Salomon Gonzalez Garcia, Eduardo 
Hurtado Galvis, Luis Daniel Parra Munoz, and Jose Maria Larrea 
Corredor.

  [Text] Quito, 15 Mar (EFE) -- The Ecuadoran Government on 
15 March announced that it will appeal before all legal bodies 
the decision of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] to not hold 
a plebiscite on 1 May on constitutional issues requested by 
President Sixto Duran-Ballen. 
  Carlos Larreategui, minister secretary general of public 
administration, made this announcement and pointed out that the 
TSE's decision is "an attack on democracy" stemming from a 
"conspiracy" of the electoral interests of two opposition 
parties, namely the Social Christian Party (PSC) and the 
Democratic Left (ID). 
  In the first public reaction by a government official after 
the TSE decision was revealed, Larreategui said that President 
Duran-Ballen, who is touring Japan and China, will address his 
compatriots on 16 March from Tokyo on the decision made by the 
top electoral tribunal. 
  Vice President Alberto Dahik, the acting chief of state, is 
meeting with several ministers and other officials to discuss 
the situation. 
  The plebiscite requested by Duran-Ballen sought to consult 
Ecuadorans on the reelection of the president and other public 
officials, which is currently banned by the Constitution, and 
also on the term of the mandate and the powers that parliament 
members should have, among other issues.

<F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" Newscast] </F>
  [Excerpt] You have probably already heard about this next 
report, although yesterday it was only a rumor. Nevertheless, 
the National Bank of Mexico [Banamex] confirmed the news at 
about 2315 on 14 March. I am referring to the kidnapping of 
Alfredo Harp Helu, president of the Banamex Stock and Securities 
Co. He is the president of the Administration Council of this 
important financial group, which is also known as Banamex 
Accival. Harp was kidnapped on 14 March in Coyoacan 
neighborhood just before 0800. 
  The Grand Marquis in which Harp and his chauffeur, Eliseo 
Ortiz, were traveling was apparently intercepted by three 
people; another report says as many as seven individuals may 
have been involved. The car was stopped at the intersection of 
Caballo Calco Street and Hidalgo Avenue across from Hidalgo 
Park, a few meters from the Coyoacan council building. 
  According to reports, Eliseo Ortiz was drugged and 
handcuffed 
by the criminals. Alfredo Harp, according to Banamex sources, 
did not resist the kidnappers. Harp was heading for his office 
on Madero Street in the historic center of Mexico City at 0800 
on 14 March, where he was scheduled to have breakfast with other 
Banamex stockholders. 
  After the kidnapping, chauffeur Eliseo Ortiz received 
medical 
treatment at Angeles Hospital. The vehicle in which Harp was 
traveling, the Grand Marquis, was found at El Rosedal 
neighborhood, very close to where the crime was committed. The 
chauffeur, after receiving treatment at Angeles Hospital, was 
taken to Banamex headquarters on Madero Street, Mexico City, 
where he was interrogated by officials from the Attorney 
General's Office. 
  Other sources reported that there was a shoot-out with the 
kidnappers in El Rosedal neighborhood and that one of them was 
reportedly arrested. Isidoro Resa Valdes, director of the 
Federal District Judicial Police, telephoned Harp's residence at 
1430 on 14 March. At that time, Harp's family denied Harp had 
been kidnapped, saying that he was in Acapulco. Harp, however, 
failed to attend the official unveiling of the Mexico Red 
Devils, a baseball team he had just purchased along with other 
stockholders of the Banamex Accival financial group. 
  Roberto Mansur, president of the Red Devils and one of 
Harp's 
partners, has commented on the kidnapping. Mansur said this 
incident has affected his partners and the Red Devils' owners so 
much that there will be changes in Mexican baseball's opening 
day ceremonies. We will have Mansur's statements later. 
  As of last night, the kidnappers had not contacted Harp's 
relatives or representatives of the Banamex Accival financial 
group. Officials from various agencies requested that 
information not be disseminated because Harp's safety is at 
stake. 
  Stock market analysts who were consulted said they believe 
that the drop in the Mexican Stock Exchange's price index on 14 
March was strongly influenced by reports of Harp's kidnapping. 
A Banamex news release states that the kidnapping has not yet 
been confirmed. Meanwhile, the Mexican Stock Exchange suffered 
another sharp decline today. [passage omitted on stock market

  [Text] The many government obstacles and maneuvers did not 
prevent the success of the peaceful march carried out by 
peasants this morning in the capital to demand a better price 
for cotton, the review of the government policy on land 
distribution, and assistance for rural settlements. 
  The demonstration of community spirit shown by the peasants 
did not, however, have President Juan Carlos Wasmosy as a 
witness, who early this morning left for Brazil with Bolivian 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada to attend the inauguration 
of a navigation sluice. 
  That ceremony was not even attended by Brazilian President 
Itamar Franco. Wasmosy's activity was labeled inappropriate and 
irresponsible by peasant leaders. 
  Since last night, the government had ordered strict control 
on all roads of all vehicles carrying people to Asuncion. The 
National Police and the Highway Patrol even halted trucks at the 
toll stations in Coronel Oviedo, Carapegua, Tacuara, and San 
Jose de los Arroyos. 
  The Public Works and Communications Ministry also revived an 
old 1948 decree, which was never enforced, that prohibits 
carrying people in cargo trucks. 
  The machinery of that ministry and companies under 
government 
contracts also obstructed the free movement of vehicles by the 
Yhaguy River near Itacurubi de la Cordillera. In this regard, 
the alleged participation of the Public Works and Communications 
Ministry in the assembly of "tire busters" (nails to flatten 
tires) made members of Congress intervene. 
  The march, without precedent in our country's history, 
gathered thousands of peasants from different parts of the 
country in front of the Congress building. The largest group 
gathered at the Metropolitan Seminary's facilities on Kubitschek 
and 25 de Mayo Avenues, from where they left to gather in front 
of Congress. 
  By this paper's publication deadline [ULTIMA HORA is an 
afternoon newspaper], no incidents of any kind had been reported 
in the country. Strong security was seen mainly in Asuncion and 
around Congress. 
  The police forces were supported by Armed Forces members in 
combat uniforms who were located at strategic points. 
Helicopters also flew over the city. 
  The demonstrators came to the city in different kinds of 
vehicles in the face of the obstacles created by bus owners. The 
peasants' mobilization was supported by high school and 
university students and labor unions. The political parties and 
movements only made an appeal to their followers to support the 
mobilization. 
  At the same time the mobilization in the capital was taking 
place, agricultural organizations closed Highway 6 near 
kilometer 143 at the Santa Clara crossing, the highway to 
Hernandarias at kilometer 4 (with the support of student 
groups), and the road to Villeta. In Carapegua, the peasants who 
were forced to get out of trucks decided to block Route 1 for 
about two hours. The need to have their demands heard by the 
government made many peasants walk 25 km (this happened in the 
General Resquin area).

  [Excerpts] Peruvian union leaders have systematically 
raised charges before international labor organizations since 
1990 for the only purpose of curtailing international economic 
cooperation with Peru, Labor Minister Augusto Antonioli told EL 
PERUANO during an exclusive interview. 
  He said he is a witness to this labor union policy and that 
he is not surprised at the lack of foundation for the charges 
made by the Peruvian labor confederations' coordinating board 
before several organizations like the International Labor 
Organization (ILO). 
  Antonioli added that a hypothetical and improbable trade 
sanction against Peru will not affect at all the leaders of the 
CGTP [General Confederation of Peruvian Workers] or the CTP 
[Confederation of Peruvian Workers] who have made these charges 
because they are not wage earners like the rest of the country's 
workers. 
  "The elimination of import tax exemptions by the United 
States would affect Peruvian workers but not their union 
leaders," he said. 
  It must be pointed out that alleged violations of labor 
rights were not made only during the Clinton administration. 
Such charges also were made during the last part of the 
administration of former President Bush when Peruvian union 
leaders sought to make the United States adopt repressive 
measures against Peru, but they were never taken into 
consideration. 
  The AFL-CIO used to represent to CGTP leaders a symbol of 
oligarchy, of "Yankee imperialism," but now the CGTP wants this 
organization to raise charges of alleged labor rights 
violations. "All this is incredible," Antonioli said. [passage 
omitted] 
  Regarding this attitude, Minister Antonioli said: "The 
current CGTP leaders are not respecting the agreements made 
between the government and deceased CGTP leader Pedro Huillca 
Tecse. All the progress we made during the negotiations with him 
is lost. I do not understand the current union leaders' policy." 
  As for the observations made by the ILO to the Peruvian 
Government in the labor field, Antonioli said our country 
already has given a sound explanation about Peruvian workers' 
real situation and the labor policy implemented by the 
administration of President Alberto Fujimori. 
  "Our labor law has 86 articles and seven complementary, 
temporary, and final provisions. The ILO has observed 16 
articles and some clauses, which means that the rest of the law 
is correct. The articles that were questioned are exactly those 
we explained with foundation, clearly establishing their scope," 
Minister Antonioli said.

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said today in 
Phnom Penh that his country's diplomatic offensive seeks to 
convey the truth about the Caribbean Island, within the dynamic 
context of changes in the current world. 
  Speaking to local Phnom Penh reporters, Robaina said that 
the 
basic objective of his previous tours of Caribbean and African 
countries, and his current tour of Asian countries, is to 
explain the truth about what is being done in Cuba. In 
developing our foreign policy, we need to explain to our friends 
and to governments what we are doing in our country regarding 
the economic transformation process in which we are engulfed, 
Robaina said. 
  With these objectives, we could not ignore this region, 
which 
has achieved important economic results over the past few years. 
Their experience can be useful to us, Robaina added. 
  The Cuban foreign minister told the press that Cuba is open 
to foreign investments in the areas of petroleum, nickel, 
agriculture, tourism, biotechnology, and the pharmaceutical 
industry. He added that this process is difficult and complex 
because it is done under the tremendous pressure of the blockade 
imposed by Washington against Cuba for more than 30 years. There 
is still implacable persecution of all those willing to 
negotiate with Cuba. Today, of every 10 contacts we make, eight 
are suspended because of such threats. But by no means will we 
stop our direct contacts with various countries throughout the 
world, he said. 
  Robaina in Phnom Penh stressed the success achieved despite 
the economic, commercial, and financial blockade, and added: We 
are neither hell nor heaven, but a beautiful island, which 
defends its sovereignty, independence, and achievements.

<F P=106> [Live report from New Delhi via telephone, by special </F>
correspondent Rey Rodriguez] 
  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrived in 
New Delhi today on his tour through Southeast Asia. Robaina's 
visit is at the invitation of Salman Khursheed, minister of 
state for external affairs, who visited Cuba last November. On 
that occasion, Khursheed conveyed to his Cuban counterpart 
India's interest in entering spheres such as biotechnology, 
fishing, and the sugar industry. 
  This nation of over 800 million inhabitants has a high level 
of scientific-technical development and great trade, and it 
exerts a marked influence in the region. 
  Before arriving in India, Robaina made a 24-hour visit to 
Cambodia, where he was received by Cambodia's Foreign Affairs 
Minister, Prince Norodom Sirivut. During Robaina's visit, the 
two leaders agreed to put political and economic relations on 
the same level, and coincided in seeking new forms of 
cooperation for mutual benefit. Robaina arrived in Cambodia at a 
time when Cambodia is increasingly seeking to incorporate itself 
into the region as it tries to find a negotiated solution to the 
conflict in that nation -- through a program of national 
reconciliation signed in Paris last November. 
  Tomorrow the Cuban foreign minister will meet with his 
counterpart Dinesh Singh and with representatives of the Chamber 
of Commerce and Industry. He will also tour the Indira Gandhi 
Memorial. 
  On Saturday, Robaina will be in Malaysia, where he is 
expected to have meetings with important businessmen, after 
which he will leave for Vietnam, the last stop of this tour 
through Asia.

<F P=106> ["Our Opinion" station editorial by Orlando Contreras] </F>
  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina today will 
arrive in India as part of a visit to several Asian countries. 
As is well known, this tour began in Indonesia, the country 
leading the nonaligned movement. The Indonesian Government and 
the productive sectors in general have reaffirmed their 
willingness and desire to increase trade and cooperation with 
our country in several areas. 
  Robaina's trip through that region of ancient culture is 
still underway, so it is premature to make an assessment, either 
country by country or of the mission as a whole. I believe, 
however, that the objective of these visits has been achieved. 
  Cuba needs to make known to the world the true situation 
current in the country, and its new strategies to counteract the 
perverse blockade and the collapse of the European socialist 
bloc, particularly of the ex-Soviet Union. Our international 
relations also have an impact on the priorities of our economy 
within the context of principles. 
  Today I would like to underscore the importance of the Cuban 
foreign minister's visit to India. This Asian country is one of 
the most heavily populated nations on earth, a multinational, 
multiethnic, and pluricultural country, the industry of which is 
extremely versatile. 
  India and Cuba are linked by long-standing ties of 
friendship. As you are all well aware, both were founders of the 
nonaligned movement in 1961, and both countries demand the right 
to a dignified life for Third World nations, which implies 
international cooperation, trade without barriers, transfer of 
technology in an unrestricted manner, and respect for 
self-determination and national sovereignty. 
  Commander in Chief Fidel Castro had already visited this 
vast 
nation, the culture of which spans more than four milleniums, 
and which was responsible for one of the earliest literary 
creations of man. Its great forefathers and leading figures of 
the modern state, beginning with Gandhi; then Nehru; later, 
Nehru's daughter Indira; and finally, Rajiv Gandhi, have 
enhanced the policy of peace, mutual understanding, and demands 
for the rights of neglected peoples. 
  With all of these precedents, it is easy to assess the 
importance of this visit the Cuban foreign minister will begin 
within the next few hours to India, without minimizing, of 
course, the visits he already made to other countries of the 
region, and the visits he is still to make to other Asian 
countries, all of them heirs to ancestral cultures.

  [Text] The Argentine town of La Plata, capital of the 
Buenos Aires Province, and the municipality of Havana Vieja have 
decided to formally establish a mutual cooperation agreement. 
  As part of a visit to Cuba of an Argentine delegation from 
La 
Plata, an agreement was signed in Havana to declare Havana Vieja 
and La Plata twin sisters. The agreement was signed by Raul 
Joaquin Perez, chairman of the La Plata Town Council, and 
(Miguel Angel Brown), president of the Assembly of the People's 
Government in Havana Vieja. Both parties recognize the 
friendship ties between the two towns and promise to actively 
cooperate in the areas of tourism, preservation of their 
historical heritage, health, sports, and culture. 
  [Begin Perez recording] They have given us a great deal of 
material, including the laws that are in effect in Havana, the 
tax system prevailing in Havana, the coparticipation framework 
among companies, and others. Well, speaking of Cuba is speaking 
of tremendous development in the textile industry, for instance; 
and of course we know that, because of the special period, some 
important factories with qualified personnel have been closed. 
We believe that we also have a propitious field in this area 
because our city has a petrochemical industry that produces such 
raw materials as threads. [end recording] 
  La Plata is a town of 900 square km, with some 600,000 
inhabitants. Its economy is based on fruit, vegetable, and 
flower production, in addition to an important petrochemical 
plant and several large- and medium-sized industries.

  [Text] Cuban ambassador to Brazil Jorge Bolanos, who is 
ending his diplomatic mission in that country, has predicted 
that trade between Brazil and Cuba will take a giant step this 
year. He announced the visit within the next few months of 
several delegations to Cuba. He made these announcements during 
a dinner given for him in Sao Paulo by some 120 local 
businessmen who have businesses in Cuba. 
  In a news conference reference to relations between the two 
countries, Bolanos said that Brazil must hold the position it 
deserves in this stage of recovery and development of the Cuban 
economy. 
  The Brazilian businessmen presented Bolanos a plaque noting 
the outstanding historic events in bilateral economic ties.

  [Text] Through its position against the economic blockade 
of Cuba, Canada is showing its intention to adopt a policy more 
independent of that of the United States and one of greater 
rapprochement to Latin America, said Canadian Foreign Minister 
Andre Ouellet today. The minister stressed the need to 
strengthen the ties between Canada and Latin America, a region 
in which, in his opinion, the OAS can play a decisive role.

  [Text] Revolution Commander and Politburo member Juan 
Almeida Bosque, who is also chairman of the National Association 
of Veterans of the Revolution, has met with members of the 
secretariat of the Association of Cuban Revolution Veterans in 
Granma. Speaking in Bayamo, Almeida Bosque stressed the need to 
restore popular target-shooting practice and to encourage all 
the people to participate in this activity. 
  In a meeting with members of the Veterans secretariat, 
Almeida Bosque stressed the need to organize a movement for 
counseling children and young people to make target shooting a 
common practice if we want each Cuban to learn how to shoot and 
shoot well. 
  To achieve this, he recommended development through 
initiatives, contests, and other activities, but always with the 
objective of contributing to preparing the people for defense. 
  Accompanied by Division General Ramon Espinosa Martin, chief 
of the Eastern Army; Vice Admiral Aldo Santamaria Cuadrado; 
other chiefs and officers; and local Granma political leaders, 
Almeida Bosque expressed interest in current activities, in 
discipline, in patriotic-military work, and stressed as 
unavoidable the need for the association to be self-financed.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 
Havana radio and television in Spanish between 12 and 16 March. 
  Radio Reloj at 1504 GMT on 12 March reports that Matanzas 
Province is outstanding in controlling borers through biological 
means. In 1993, despite the nation's resource shortages, some 48 
million borer-eating flies were released to control the pests in 
78,000 caballerias. It is estimated that borers are responsible 
for losses of between 9,000 and 130,000 tons of sugar per year. 
  Radio Reloj at 1509 GMT on 12 March reports that the Eliseo 
Caamano Agriculture-Livestock Production Cooperative in 
Consolacion del Sur Municipality, Pinar del Rio Province, 
expects to harvest 5,000 quintals of tobacco during the current 
campaign, a record figure in the co-op's 15 years of existence. 
The co-op has harvested 250,000 poles of tobacco to date, almost 
50 percent of the expected harvest. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 12 March reports that Ciego de 
Avila Province has had the biggest white grapefruit harvest in 
history, 14,500 tons in the 1993-94 campaign. 
  In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that exploitation of a 
small gold mine in the Castellanos multimetallic deposit in 
Minas de Matahambre, Pinar del Rio Province, will begin next 
month. The engineer in charge of extraction and processing says 
the gold is in tiny particles that will have to be extracted 
from the soil. He says approximately one pound of gold, worth 
$6,000 on the world market, can be obtained from every 500 tons 
of soil. Putting the mine into operation will provide jobs for 
over 200 excess workers from Pinar del Rio's mining enterprise. 
Exploiting the mine has been made possible through an investment 
of approximately 3 million pesos. 
  Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 14 March reports that in three 
days of work members of the Antiaircraft Defense and 
Revolutionary Air Force reached 142 percent of potato picking, a 
great labor feat. In San Antonio de los Banos, Havana Province, 
250 DAAFAR members are supporting the food program on orders of 
the high command. Lieutenant Colonel (Juan Avelero), deputy 
chief of the troops, has said that in Havana 2,000 men from 
various Western Army units helping pick tomatoes will remain for 
some 30 days to work in the potato harvest. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 15 March reports that the 
Siguaney factory in Sancti Spiritus is producing a new variety 
of gray cement which has proven very resistant to salt water and 
good for many uses, including blocks. Specialists point out that 
its production allows the factory to save 10 kwh of electricity 
and 26 kg of oil per ton: in other words, 11 percent less than 
what was traditionally required. 
  Radio Reloj in its 2030 GMT newscast on 15 March reports the 
following: 
  "The Colombian subsidiary of the English hotel chain (Forte) 
has, at Cubanacan's request, taken over the administration and 
marketing of the (Las Yagrumas) Hotel in San Antonio de los 
Banos." Cubanacan president Abraham Maciques confirms: 
"Cubanacan has signed similar joint ventures -- which guarantee 
a market, experience, and technology -- with prestigious hotel 
groups from Spain, the Netherlands, Jamaica, Germany, and 
Canada." 
  In Sancti Spiritus Province since January, 300 caballerias 
of 
cane have been cultivated using oxen. The province's Basic 
Cooperative Production Units, agricultural-livestock 
cooperatives, credit and services cooperatives, and state 
organizations own over 1,600 teams of oxen. Sector workers 
intend to cultivate some 2,800 caballerias of land using ox 
teams, in addition to working on self- sufficiency plots and the 
planting, collecting, and transportation of cane. The Ministry 
of the Sugar Industry aims to have some 2,300 teams of oxen by 
the end of 1994. 
  The workers of the sugar industry's machine shops in Havana 
are carrying out two important tasks this year: manufacturing 
chains for cane and conveyor belts (esteras) for bagasse, in 
cooperation with a Spanish firm. They continue to support the 
production of spare parts. 
  The National Association of Small Farmers (ANAP) will this 
year put a plan into effect to motivate those agricultural 
producers most outstanding in fulfilling their plans for 
collection and sales to state organizations. This was reported 
at the ANAP provincial plenum in Matanzas, which analyzed 
production and collection management in the small farm sector. 
The plenum, held at the Alberto Delgado Cooperative in Perico 
Municipality, was presided over by ANAP President Orlando Lugo 
Fonte and attended by Agriculture Vice Minister Luis Gonzalez. 
  The first Guitart-Cayo Coco tourist complex, in the cays 
north of Ciego de Avila Province, has hosted close to 20,000 
foreign tourists during its nearly 10 months of operation. This 
complex opened in April 1993 to outstanding Ciego de Avila 
workers, received its first foreign visitors a month later, and 
was officially inaugurated on 12 November 1993. There are plans 
to build a second Guitart-Cubanacan tourist installation on Cayo 
Coco. 
  The workers of the Ramiro Santiago fish farm in Las Tunas 
are 
trying to produce 20 million tilapia larvae and 12 million fry 
in 1994, figures far greater than in 1993. In 1993, a little 
more than 1,000 tons of fish were produced there; in 1994, the 
farm expects to raise this figure to 1,600. Las Tunas' program 
designed to increase production to 8,000 tons in the next four 
years will provide each inhabitant of the province two pounds of 
freshwater fish per month. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 16 March reports that Cuba is 
going to cultivate sunflowers to produce fodder and sunflower 
oil. Lieutenant Colonel Gilberto Pena Martinez says a 
multidisciplinary group from the Ministry of the Interior is 
going to work with each province to begin planting in August and 
to begin developing the industry with a view to meeting 
approximately 50 percent of the ministry's fat needs.

  [Text] The Haitian internal opposition to the return of 
President Aristide, in facing the political blockade imposed as 
an attempt to solve the crisis, appears ready to move for real 
this time, following a congress held on 11 March in 
Port-au-Prince. Now the leaders of opposition parties will try 
to relaunch the mobilization this week. Rothschild Francois 
filed a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Francois] Mobilization, unity, and 
reconciliation are the watchwords of the coordination committee 
that issued from among the political parties at the Visa Lodge 
meeting. Those political formations, mostly hostile to President 
Aristide, deem the political vacuum in the Haitian executive 
dangerous and abnormal. Those parties, including the MDN 
[Mobilization For National Development], FRAPH [Revolutionary 
Front for Haitian Advancement and Progress], and RDR [Assembly 
of Democrats for the Republic] blame the state for the misery 
prevailing in the country. This situation could lead to a social 
explosion in Haiti, according to the analysis of those parties, 
grouped together within the coordination committee presided over 
by Attorney Gregoire Eugene. For this assembly of political 
leaders opposed to the return of President Aristide, 
mobilization is imperative right now in order to extract the 
country from the crisis. 
  [Eugene] Facing this imminent peril, it is urgent that the 
entire national population mobilize. Following the meeting at 
Visa Lodge on 11 March, it has been decided to launch a national 
mobilization under the motto: love, unity, reconciliation. A 
nine-member coordination committee has been established to 
assure coordination of this mobilization imposed by the 
realities of the difficult times we are experiencing. We make a 
point -- given the national peril -- of giving an essentially 
national character to the efforts for a solution to the crisis. 
  [Francois] The coordination committee intends to hold a news 
conference on Wednesday. In this meeting, which will be open to 
other political groups, more should come out regarding the 
strategy that the committee intends to follow to achieve this 
mobilization. 
  According to the president of the coordinating committee, 
based on the initiatives of these political formations from the 
opposition, the country must come out of the crisis. [end

  [Text] Senator Bernard Sansaricq is supporting the stance 
of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Countries of the 
United Nations opposing the idea of a possible reinforcement of 
the sanctions against Haiti. Sansaricq, president of the other 
Office of the Haitian Senate, thinks the Group of Latin American 
Countries should have also demanded the lifting of the 
international sanctions against Haiti. 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] [Sansaricq] They have seen that 
the embargo has yielded nothing. On the contrary, it has 
hardened the stance of some in Haiti who are really fighting for 
democracy and who have said that foreign countries do not have 
the right to interfere in our internal affairs and that we have 
definitively decided to pay the price -- no matter what it is. 
They have seen that an illegal and criminal embargo -- an 
embargo aimed at destroying the country, the country's economy, 
and the Haitian people -- has already caused 25,000 deaths in 
Haiti, not to mention children. We cannot imagine the 
destruction brought to the country's ecology. 
  There will be elections very soon in the Dominican Republic. 
The country's situation can affect the results of those 
elections. There are factors that show the other Latin American 
countries that this nonsense cannot continue. They must finally 
lift the embargo and let Haiti decide for itself on its own 
fate. Not only do I share their opinion but I think they should 
have gone further, they should have demanded the outright 
lifting of the embargo against Haiti. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Furthermore, Sen. Sansaricq has 
called on all sectors of the national life to participate in the 
formation of a new government. 
  [Sansaricq] Since I was [elected] president of the Senate, 
we 
have been ready and waiting for the other institutions which 
will accompany us in the process of establishing a nationalist 
government, a government that can lead the fate of the country, 
because we cannot remain in this deep confusion with the 
resigning Robert Malval government that is doing nothing, that 
is dismissing people from time to time even though it has no 
right to do so because it is a resigning government. 
  The Senate is ready; the Senate has always said it is ready. 
We are ready to do what has to be done so we can form a 
nationalist government in Haiti. We are open. We are open so we 
can reach a solution that will get the country out of the 
crisis. The Senate is open. The Senate is ready. [end recording]

  [Text] One can only sell what one owns. This is what 
Aristide spokesman Jean-Claude Martineau said to explain to 
public opinion that Jean-Bertrand Aristide has nothing to do 
with the Mole Saint-Nicolas thing, or the (Portortuga) affair. 
The Haitian president is not involved in this matter -- not 
closely nor even remotely -- nor is any other member of the 
government involved in this matter. However, perhaps the main 
person accused, Commerce Minister Louis Dejoie, is. The matter 
is still just a rumor, but it will be looked into, says 
Jean-Claude Martineau. 
  [Begin Martineau recording, in Creole] Something is being 
said discreetly throughout the country: The commerce minister 
has allegedly given a company a portion of Mole Saint-Nicolas. 
The rumor says that no other part of the government knows about 
it. Since this is a rumor, we will try to obtain information 
about it. 
  Meanwhile, however, President Aristide would like to inform 
the public that he has nothing to do with that matter. Should it 
be true, the minister alone must bear full responsibility for 
it. When one does not own land, one cannot sell that land. [end 
recording] 
  Let us recall that during a news conference by the Group of 
Democratic Parliamentarians [Groupe des Parlementaires 
Democrates, GPD], Deputy Samuel Madistin accused the minister of 
commerce of having signed a contract with the company 
(Portortuga S.A.) granting it a portion of Mole Saint-Nicolas. 
This contract allegedly gives the company exclusive rights to 
build an entertainment and leisure facility on land located in 
Mole Saint-Nicolas.

  [Text] The Justice Committee of the Chamber of Deputies is 
studying the bill on amnesty prepared by Deputy Evans Beaubrun. 
The document submitted to the committee members for analysis 
will then be presented to the assembly for a vote. 
  The author of this bill, Deputy Evans Beaubrun of Leogane, 
while acknowledging that the right to grant amnesty in political 
matters is exercised by the president of the Republic, believes 
that legislators have the right to legislate on all matters, 
including amnesty. 
  It should be noted that the chairman of the Justice 
Committee, Deputy Samuel Madistin, went underground after 
receiving threats. 
  Vice President Edmond Mirold tells us about the bill: 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] [Mirold] It is a bill that the 
Justice Committee is going to work on. Since the president of 
the deputies, Deputy Samuel Madistin, has not given any 
indication, I am going to try to get in touch with him as soon 
as possible to see whether we could work on the bill and submit 
an efficient work to the assembly for the deputies' vote. 
  [Reporter Jean] In view of the importance of this amnesty 
law, how long do you think it will take the Justice Committee to 
submit the bill to the assembly? 
  [Mirold] As I am not the chairman, I do not want to give any 
date. I will become the chairman, once I write to the chairman 
of the Justice Committee and he fails to answer. Then I will 
assume my responsibility as vice chairman, and I could give a 
date. Until I meet with President Madistin and he either gives 
me the green light to work or does not show up and I start 
working, I remain subject to his decision. 
  [Jean] What is your personal opinion, Deputy Mirold? 
  [Mirold] It appears to be a good work. However, I think that 
the committee will have to do a great deal of work on the text, 
taking into account the passions of the context in which the 
bill will be voted. The assembly will have a lot of work to do 
after the Justice Committee does its work. [end recording]

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] There has been a new resignation in the FNCD 
[National Front for Change and Democracy] parliamentary bloc. 
Deputy Evans Picault is pulling out of the camp of Aristide 
supporters. The deputy, disappointed with the behavior of his 
former allies and opponents, is considering turning his back on 
politics. In announcing his future withdrawal from political 
life, the deputy was not soft on the political sector, the 
international community, or the exiled president, whom he holds 
responsible for the failure of the democratic experience that 
began in December 1990. Edner Jean filed a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Jean] In his statement to Radio 
Metropole, 
Evans Picault left out no one, neither his former friends nor 
his opponents. I want to leave with a light heart and a clear 
conscience, he told us. In his farewell to FNCD, the deputy from 
Saint-Marc revealed his disgust with politics and his 
disappointments as a militant. I never thought I would reach 
such a decision, he said. But, facing the failure of FNCD in the 
management of the political crisis, Deputy Picault sees no 
alternative to turning his back on the Front under whose banner 
he was elected to the 45th Legislature. And before he closed the 
door, Picault, to avenge himself on his former leaders for 
having betrayed his political convictions, took time to rip off 
their masks. 
  [Picault, in Creole] The leaders themselves do not want 
Aristide to return. They are just playing politics; foreigners 
are leading those men. There is not one of them who does not 
have a foreigner behind him. I got involved in politics because 
I love my country and I am a young man. I see Haiti as a country 
with many problems, and I wanted to fight for democracy. 
  Then I realized that politics was a business. I told myself 
that it was out of the question for me to continue fighting in 
organizations that have no credibility or depth. Their speech is 
different from their actions. As a consequence, I cannot stay 
involved in such a thing. 
  The reason I am standing up today to announce officially 
that 
I am resigning from FNCD and Conacom [National Congress of 
Democratic Movements] is that I realize that those men are not 
democrats. How can one be part of the government of a person who 
is in exile, be fighting for his return, be a minister of his 
government, and sign something he did not sign? It is a scandal. 
It is not politics. He [not further identified] should have left 
his government first, then sign his crooked deal. 
  [Jean] Evans Picault is not, however, sweet toward President 
Aristide. In his statement, he put the former Saint-Jean Bosco 
priest on the bench of the accused, calling him an apprentice 
dictator. He wanted to fight everyone at the same time, while he 
had no concept of democracy, explains the deputy, who regrets 
that the people voted in Father Aristide. The people will pay 
dearly for their vote, exclaimed Evans Picault. 
  In addition, he condemned the embargo imposed on Haiti at 
the 
request of the president. 
  [Picault, in Creole] The first person to blame for the 
failure of democracy is Aristide. Because Aristide was not the 
person to vote in as president. Aristide lacked 
clear-headedness. When you are fighting for something, you must 
understand that the enemies you attack are more powerful than 
you. He did not use diplomacy to hold power. When he took power, 
he attacked everyone. He attacked the bourgeoisie, he attacked 
the macoutes. The macoutes are a force after 30 years of power. 
Who can overthrow the macoutes in this country? You can burn 
some little macoutes during popular upheavals but how can you 
burn up macoutes? I have never accepted this kind of thing. 
  Second point: Aristide thought that he could destroy the 
military institution with other institutions he was going to 
establish. He could have done it, with some reservations. The 
person whom you decide to attack already knows it; then you 
fail. He did not lead the struggle properly. Furthermore, 
Aristide did not have any political skill in his speeches. 
  [Jean] Deputy Picault added that Father Aristide has no 
intention of returning to Haiti; he did not see why many other 
lives must be sacrificed for a man who is enjoying comfort and 
luxury in Washington. The deputy from Saint-Marc, without regret 
or guilt, is turning a page in his life. After 14 years in 
active politics, Evans Picault hopes to complete his education 
in engineering, as soon as his mandate is over. To make sure he 
did not omit anything, he looks back on the past and looks at 
the country. 
  [Picault, in Creole] I do not see any hope for democracy in 
this country, because our enemies are very powerful. It is not 
those inside who are the most important, but those on the 
outside. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpt] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio today began an 
official two-day visit to Mexico amid agitation among public 
workers, despite an agreement the president himself signed with 
a group of government workers yesterday afternoon. The 
agreement between the government and the National Federation of 
Public Employees Unions, Fenasep, establishes wage increases of 
between 100 and 120 quetzales through a so-called emergency 
bonus program. The agreement also establishes Fenasep's 
inclusion on the Wage Policy Commission -- a strategy designed 
to bolster consumer protection and to make government services 
more efficient. 
  President de Leon Carpio referred to this agreement in a 
news 
conference at the airport this morning, minutes before leaving 
for Mexico. 
  [Begin De Leon recording] The government has nothing more to 
discuss in light of the fact that yesterday it signed an 
agreement that ends the strike, which was clearly illegal and 
even criminal in nature because it did not meet the legal 
requirements for declaring a strike. From this moment onward, 
the government declares that the problem has ended. Perhaps the 
most important point in yesterday's agreement, aside from the 
actual point of contention, is the pledge by both sides to make 
changes. 
  The agreement itself reads: The government of the Republic 
promises to guarantee the enforcement of the Consumer Protection 
Law. Both sides have agreed on the need to review the 
government's current organizational structure to make it more 
efficient and thereby offer an effective response to the needs 
of the Guatemalan people. In view of Fenasep's need to 
implement more consistent general policies, from this date 
onward -- in other words, yesterday -- Fenasep is joining the 
government team on the Wage Policy Commission. This is being 
done in an effort to establish a framework that will define wage 
policies on a continuous basis and not just when the need arises. 
  This means that the agreement that has been signed not only 
resolves this problem, but from this moment onward, both sides 
will sit at the negotiating table to review the state employment 
structure. If through these talks we see an opportunity to 
increase wages to bolster efficiency or because we encounter a 
reduction in the number of state workers, we can change wage 
policies at that time. This will be a result of the review 
process. 
  We can say with satisfaction that the strike ended today, 
just as the media has announced. Any further job action will be 
considered illegal. Just as illegal acts were controlled 
yesterday, some of which were carried out by criminals, the same 
holds true today under acting President Arturo Herbruger. As of 
today, all public administration should be working normally in 
light of the fact that the government has accepted the emergency 
bonus, whose cost can be covered without affecting the 
Guatemalan people. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Honduras yesterday officially signed in Geneva, 
Switzerland, the GATT membership protocol to become a 
contracting party after two years of difficult negotiations. 
  From Geneva, Economy and Commerce Minister Dalmer Urbizo 
Panting, after signing the GATT protocol, reported the ceremony 
was held in the presence of 26 GATT contracting countries. "For 
Honduras, the signing of this protocol represents a historical 
event of great importance, which concludes a long, intense, and 
sustained campaign to transform and strengthen the economy's 
external sector," Panting noted. 
  With the signing of the membership memorandum, it is now up 
to Congress to ratify Honduras' GATT membership. On 11 April, 
at the latest, the country will become a contracting party. 
  Additionally, Panting reported that he met with 
representatives of the Intellectual Property Office in Geneva, 
where techniques were established to create a similar office in 
Honduras. He added that the way in which this organization will 
cooperate with our country in different areas was analyzed in 
order to establish an adequate framework for international 
investments.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vice President Virgilio Godoy by </F>
unidentified reporters at the Radio Corporacion studios in 
Managua; date not given; from the "0900 Surprise" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Reporter] Dr. Godoy, thank you very much for 
accepting Radio Corporacion's invitation. We have many 
questions in the wake of Mr. Alexander Watson's visit. Certain 
political factions are very concerned over the way this 
gentleman has referred to the Nicaraguan situation. He said 
Nicaraguans must resolve their own problems. In an interview 
with us, Luis Sanchez Sancho [secretary general of the 
Nicaraguan Socialist Party] indicated that this gentleman 
apparently is obsessed with the Sandinists. This is very 
discomforting. How did your talks with Mr. Watson go? 
  [Godoy] I would say our conversation was quite ordinary. Of 
course, it was characterized by the simultaneous discussion of a 
number of problems. Specifically, the assistant secretary of 
state talked about what he and his government deem to be a 
special or key concern -- namely, that Nicaragua is giving no 
sign of resolving its problems or starting to resolve them, and 
that there is no evidence of any progress. Nevertheless, Watson 
did not give an opinion as to the reasons behind this delay in 
finding solutions. 
  We discussed various issues, many of which focused on 
economic matters, but finally, after a generally broad analysis, 
it was concluded by both Watson and those who accompanied him -- 
namely, Mr. Hamilton and Ambassador Maisto -- that political 
issues are at the heart of our crisis. This is because there is 
no other way to explain why Nicaragua has failed to show any 
growth, even though it has received more economic and financial 
aid than Panama and El Salvador combined within the same 
timeframe. Moreover, there are no signs of improvement on the 
horizon, because there is no evidence that this year will be any 
different from previous ones. 
  The idea that Nicaraguans should resolve their problems by 
themselves was again stressed, because there is a clear downward 
trend in international financial aid, especially aid coming from 
North America. Therefore, if we fail to take advantage of the 
aid being offered now, it will be even more difficult to find 
solutions in the future. 
  I told Mr. Watson that the U.S. decision of not meddling in 
Nicaragua's internal affairs was very appropriate. I hope, 
however, that this will prove to be true, because it is one 
thing to say the United States will not meddle, while it is 
doing just that in various forms. As I said, it is one thing to 
say: Solve your own problems, but what is advisable for you to 
do is such and such, while... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] That is one way of intervening. 
  [Godoy] What is their position then? This is their position 
on our efforts to resolve our own problems from a Nicaraguan 
vantage point, with Nicaraguan resources, and with Nicaraguan 
solutions. 
  I think we had a very lively conversation. Every possible 
solution and the need to find solutions for the country were 
discussed. We cannot figure out where to start because all of 
the options or paths that have been explored have virtually 
failed, including the path of dialogue, which was frustrated by 
an executive branch decision. 
  Moreover, the UNO [National Opposition Union] majority in 
the 
National Assembly was also broken by an executive branch 
decision. The executive branch is incompetent. It does not know 
how to, has not been able to, and has not wanted to efficiently 
manage those resources placed at its disposal. We are talking 
about several billions of dollars -- not about old cordobas 
[chancheros], but billions of dollars. The government even 
increased Nicaragua's debt. This government inherited a debt of 
about $12 billion, some $5 billion of which was forgiven, and 
yet we now owe about $13 billion. In other words, we will be 
heavily in debt by the time this government finishes its term, 
and, in turn, we will be less capable of correcting the 
situation. 
  We discussed all of these issues with Mr. Watson. We spoke 
with absolutely frankness. I told him that it is not only 
important for the United States to refrain from intervening, but 
that it is also important that it not view things solely from a 
U.S. perspective, because, for example, he mentioned to me his 
extreme concern over U.S. property that has not yet been 
returned. I told him: You are right, but Nicaraguans are not 
interested in U.S. property; we are interested in the return of 
the property of many thousands of Nicaraguans. This is part of 
the strife were are experiencing. This is what is behind the 
lack of trust in the country. I noted that this has caused the 
government to loose credibility very dramatically. Finally, the 
most disturbing result from all of this is that the country has 
come under an enormous cloak of juridical uncertainty. 
  Therefore, nobody wants, desires, or expects to invest 
here, because they think we do not have adequate conditions, 
considering that our government fails to deliver on its promises 
out of sympathy for or fear of the Sandinists, and I pointed 
this out to Mr. Watson. This is our reality. The country is 
adrift, and it cannot find a starting point for resolving its 
problems. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Godoy, was it brought up to you... [pauses] 
Did you bring up the issue of human rights in this country -- 
the murder of more than 250 Nicaraguan Resistance members and 
crimes that have never been solved, such as those involving 
Bermudez and Jean Paul? In fact, a report issued by the U.S. 
State Department was based on human rights violations in this 
country. 
  [Godoy] We did not touch on this directly, but it was 
indirectly discussed in the context of an exchange on the 
judicial branch's lack of credibility. In other words, our 
judicial system is not meeting the expectations of a true de 
jure state. In turn, this does not help people feel safe and 
secure. I said to him: If you asked your ambassador in Managua 
about the long lines of people at the consulate applying for 
visas to travel to the United States, you would certainly be 
told that people are again arriving there in the early hours of 
the morning and standing in long lines in an attempt to get a 
visa to go to the United States. Why is this? Because the 
country has failed to provide the conditions to keep people here. 
  We quickly reviewed this situation because not much can be 
done in one hour, which is how long our meeting lasted, but we 
did discuss all discussable issues. We also talked about the 
problems the government has created for itself. I told him 
there are black holes in the government that nobody can explain; 
nobody knows what has happened. 
  A case in point is Cornap [National Corporations of the 
Public Sector]. The government has spent three years 
privatizing it, but nobody knows what criteria was used, nobody 
knows the results of this privatization, and there is no 
reliable report; there is nothing. This is the only country 
that dishes out money in its privatization process. It is an 
extremely poor country, one of the poorest, and yet it dishes 
out millions of dollars to privatize. The buyer of a state-owned 
company or property not only gets the property for a song -- 
and, indeed, influence-peddlers are involved here -- but he also 
receives millions to start a new life. 
  All of these things fail to help clarify the situation in 
any 
way. As I told Romerito [not further identified], on 15 March, 
I think, they are about to implement the social mobilization 
plan to fire 15,000 state employees, because the size of the 
state must be reduced. Nevertheless, it happens that some are 
being fired while others are being hired. This government 
started with 11 ministries, but now there are 14 of them. There 
has been a permanent string of lies. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] What does Mr. Watson think about the Army? 
  [Godoy] He indicated to me that President Chamorro promised 
that General Humberto Ortega will leave the EPS [Sandinist 
People's Army] this year. Is this enough? No, it is not. This 
is what we have been saying for some time. In a way, the Army 
has become its own state; it is not within the state, but above 
the state. Such a situation would not be favorable anywhere in 
the universe. 
  There must be a review to ensure that -- if indeed this 
institution, which produces nothing more than expenses for the 
country, should continue to exist -- then it should be strictly 
subordinated to civilian power. It should be subordinated to 
civilian power, otherwise, the game will continue. We will 
pretend to be doing something that is not being done. This is a 
double standard that has created confusion in the country, which 
has taken away trust in it, and that has deprived the nation of 
juridical certainty. This has helped create the stagnation we 
have been facing for so many years. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Lucy Castillo from the "Extravision" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant secretary of state 
for inter-American affairs, is in Nicaragua to gather 
information, not to discuss issues that are strictly Nicaraguan 
internal affairs. This statement was made by National Assembly 
President Luis Humberto Guzman. Guzman explains Watson's visit 
by saying he is in Nicaragua on a fact-finding mission. 
  This morning, Watson met with the leaders of the political 
parties in parliament, with the exception of UNO's leaders, and 
with the president of the legislative branch. 
  Sergio Ramirez, the leader of the Sandinist National 
Liberation Front's [FSLN] legislative representation, 
characterized the U.S. State Department's report on human rights 
in Nicaragua as being biased. 
  [Begin Ramirez recording] I told him the human rights report 
looks like an expression of an ingrained antagonism I think 
should be expunged from the relations the United States 
maintains with the sector of Nicaraguan society represented by 
us Sandinists. In many ways, this report is anti-Sandinist and 
biased. [end recording] 
  Contradicting the human rights report, Watson reported in 
his 
speech at the U.S.-Nicaraguan Chamber of Commerce that the 
Clinton administration acknowledges the Sandinists comprise a 
legitimate Nicaraguan political force, which maintains all of 
the rights and responsibilities granted to every political party. 
  In response to a reporter's question, National Assembly 
President Luis Alberto Guzman said internal Nicaraguan affairs 
must only be discussed among Nicaraguans. 
  [Begin Guzman recording] We mentioned the constitutional 
reforms issue, but I insisted that we discuss these issues with 
the understanding that these are strictly Nicaraguan affairs. 
In no way did I request counsel or recommendations on what we 
should do in terms of such issues. These matters were discussed 
as a courtesy afforded to any foreign visitor, but I insisted 
that this would not be done in any way to solicit opinions or 
counsel on what we, the Nicaraguan people, should do. I truly 
understand that these are matters that concern us, the 
Nicaraguan people. [end recording] 
  This evening Watson met socially with various national 
political, social, and economic leaders.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] Yesterday, after meeting for seven hours, the 
Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN] Assembly called for 
immediately and radically changing the country's neoliberal 
economic course. The FSLN ratified the position that it "cannot 
endorse any agreement" with the characteristics of the Enhanced 
Structural Adjustment Facility [ESAF], a position that had 
already been presented to IMF Director Michael Camdessus. 
  The FSLN communique affirms that "the nation cannot resist 
an 
adjustment plan like the one being planned." The communique 
also backs the demands of ranchers, businessmen, industrialists, 
and producers who want policy changes in favor of production. 
  Originally convoked to discuss preparations for the FSLN 
Special Congress, the assembly dedicated a lot of time to 
analyzing the wave of massive evictions of humble families 
throughout the country and condemned the government and the 
Judicial Branch for the grave social consequences that these 
abuses will have. The assembly also supported the resistance 
that the Communal Movement has promoted against the evictions 
and urged the National Police not to lend themselves to unjust 
actions against townspeople. 
  The Sandinist Assembly stated its backing for the work the 
Sandinist bench at the National Assembly is carrying out in 
favor of the Legislative Branch's independence and rejected the 
report that the U.S. State Department drafted on the human 
rights situation in Nicaragua, considering the report to be 
"biased and meddlesome." 
  Regarding the organization of a special FSLN Congress 
session, the assembly confirmed that the session, which has been 
named Augusto Cesar Sandino -- for Sandinist Unity -- will be 
held on 20, 21, and 22 May. 
  The Sandinist Assembly authorized department organizations 
to 
elect, as guests to the FSLN National Congress, a number of 
militants equal to 30 percent of the delegates to that congress. 
These guests may speak but have no vote. Of them, 50 percent 
must be women, and 50 percent must be between 16 and 25 years 
old. 
  The FSLN will consult the National Council of Political 
Parties on the possibility of filling the vacancies left by 
deceased Congress members. 
  The document "vehemently asks that public debates between 
Sandinists be free of insults and personal caustic remarks" and 
urged party members to accept and abide by whatever decisions 
are adopted by the majority at the Congress. 
  Regarding electoral results in the Atlantic coast, the 
Sandinist Assembly accepted as valid complaints local Sandinists 
have filed because of the late delivery of material and economic 
support for their campaign. The Sandinist Assembly admitted 
that "the failure to adequately resolve political 
responsibilities in the Atlantic Coast" is an error of national 
FSLN organizations. The Sandinist Assembly especially 
acknowledged the work carried out under adverse conditions by 
the Sandinists on the coast, work that permitted the FSLN to 
emerge as "a decisive political force in both autonomous 
regions." The FSLN has backed the Atlantico Norte Sandinists' 
decision to convoke a coastal unity government tasked with 
struggling for full autonomy in the Atlantic Coast and extended 
an offer to the Atlantico Sur forces.

  [Text] El Chacal no longer wants to surrender his weapons. 
Yesterday, the 3-80 Northern Front [FN-3-80], headed by Jose 
Angel Talavera better known as El Chacal, decided to stop 
surrendering its weapons. El Chacal's decision was his response 
to the government minister's announcement that the government 
has limitations to granting the economic benefits the rebel 
leader is demanding. El Chacal is asking for 3 manzanas of land 
for each man who surrenders his weapons. The government, 
however, is offering a small piece of land where a house can be 
built. At present, El Chacal's forces consist of 250 men who 
have weapons ranging from AK rifles to surface-to-air missiles. 
Following the announcement on the suspension of the disbandment 
of El Chacal's forces, the government began a series of actions 
to maintain talks with the FN-3-80.

  [Text] Through Law No. 48 in the second half of the last 
century, Argentina decided there was no need to patent medical 
products because it was believed to go against public health 
then. That prohibition against patents did not prohibit a drug's 
inventor from registering the intellectual property under his 
name, but it did prohibit exclusive commercial exploitation. 
  This did not prevent, through the years, the installation in 
the country of many U.S. and European laboratories that included 
the main discoverers of new drugs. National laboratories 
appeared along with them that took advantage of or copied the 
formulas. 
  The status quo was accepted through the years but pressure 
increased recently to change Argentina into a country of 
"patents." In this regard, former U.S. Ambassador Terence Todman 
and former U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills warned Buenos 
Aires that it had to make drastic decisions in an area where 
there are many interests. In mid-1991, Foreign Minister Guido Di 
Tella publicly admitted that "without a medical patents law" 
there would be reprisals from the United States. 
  One year ago, early in 1993, the government sent a bill to 
Congress in support of patents. The bill did not succeed in the 
Chamber of Deputies' Industry Committee because it was 
conditioned on the United States making concessions on 
agricultural subsidies that hurt Argentina. The government 
withdrew the bill but it sent it back through the Senate. 
  Meanwhile, the national industry began to change its 
position. It was no longer "100 percent against patents." It 
admitted patents based on negotiations and agreement. 
  U.S. Ambassador James Cheek, who replaced Todman, said that 
when he arrived one of the main objectives of his diplomatic 
mission in Argentina was to get a patents law, and that he would 
not stop in this effort. The upcoming visit of U.S. Vice 
President Al Gore will add heat to that boiler. 
<H5>  Pressure </H5>
  U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor and President 
Carlos 
Menem met casually in Chile on 11 March, the day Eduardo Frei 
was inaugurated. 
  It was a "heavy" meeting without much preamble. Kantor urged 
Menem for the approval of a patents law. Kantor was only careful 
with one detail: To maintain the difference in rank with the 
Argentine president, he said "Clinton told me ..." 
  On 15 March, CLARIN had access to a note the U.S. 
pharmaceutical industry sent to Kantor demanding that sanctions 
be applied on Argentina for delaying the patents law. The note 
is dated 18 February. The Kantor-Menem meeting was on 12 March 
[date as published]. And the conclusion is obvious: The U.S. 
trade representative took into account the note sent by the U.S. 
pharmaceutical industry. 
<H5>  Super 301 </H5>
  The sanctions requested by the U.S. pharmaceutical industry 
against Argentina have a background in 1989, when that U.S. 
industry demanded the application of Resolution No. 301. 
  This regulation allows the White House, when its verifies 
"unfair competition" in countries that trade with the United 
States, to include them on the list of nations to be sanctioned. 
  The mechanism, recently refloated by President Bill Clinton 
to threaten Japan, emerged from the 1988 trade law (after 
persistent lobbying by protectionist and free trade interest). 
  Although former President Ronald Reagan accepted the 
decision 
it received a two-year grace period. 
  In 1990, "Super 301" was shelved, but due to the dispute 
with 
Japan, Clinton revived it and the U.S. pharmaceutical industry 
wants it used against Argentina.

Brazil expedite their support for the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT], and also praised the Argentine Government's 
efforts and constant willingness to send peacemaking forces to 
conflict regions. 
  Butrus-Ghali said that Argentina has become a leading 
country 
in Latin America and, despite his request, noted the efforts it 
has been making to ratify the nuclear weapon nonproliferation 
treaty. Menem, in turn, promised to hold talks with Brazil to 
this end. 
  This information was disclosed by Media Communications 
Secretary Raul Burzaco at the conclusion of the meeting held 
between Menem and Butrus-Ghali at Government House. 
  According to Burzaco, Menem and Butrus-Ghali never discussed 
the possibility of sending 200 Argentine servicemen stationed in 
Croatia to Bosnia. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Mar (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
and his Bolivian counterpart, Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada, today 
analyzed, among other subjects, the probable granting of 
Argentine credits for environmental sanitary projects on the 
common border area between the two countries for the purpose of 
preventing the spread of cholera, the situation of illegal 
Bolivian immigrants in Argentina, the struggle against drug 
trafficking, and the projections of Mercosur [Common Market of 
the South]. 
  Sanchez de Losada today arrived in Argentina on an official 
48-hour visit with the objective of signing an agreement on 
plant and animal sanitary controls and an agreement on 
investment promotion and guarantees. 
  President Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella received 
the Bolivian president at 1020 today in Metropolitan Airport's 
military section. 
  After the welcoming protocol, City Council President Juan 
Trilla, from the Radical Civic Union, gave the Bolivian chief of 
state the keys to the city. 
  During a brief news conference after the ceremony, Sanchez 
de 
Losada said one of the subjects he would discuss with Menem is 
the situation of some of his fellow countrymen living illegally 
in Argentina. 
  He added: "The control of drug trafficking is very 
important, 
and with the aid of Argentina and the international community we 
will be able to stop this problem." 
  As for the possibility that Bolivia will join Mercosur, the 
Bolivian president said: "We want to come close to Mercosur 
because we are part of the Amazon Basin," adding that "our 
future depends on exchange with the region's countries." 
  After making these statements, Sanchez de Losada departed 
for 
Alvear Palace Hotel, from where he headed to Casa Rosada, where 
he held his first working meeting with Menem. 
  After the meeting in Government House, the two presidents 
went to San Martin Palace, where Menem held a lunch in honor of 
his guest. 
  The Bolivian president had anticipated that during his visit 
to Argentina he would talk with President Menem about subjects 
like illegal immigrants, Mercosur, cholera, and the canalization 
of the Pilcomayo River. 
  Sanchez de Losada said Argentina is, for Bolivians, "almost 
a 
second fatherland; one is always very connected with this 
country and thousands of Bolivians currently live in Buenos 
Aires," which determines "a relation of vital importance for us." 
  When asked whether the subject of illegal Bolivian 
immigrants 
will be discussed, he said "that will be one of the subjects we 
will discuss" and added that they will also discuss the 
canalization of the Pilcomayo River, which is "one of Bolivia's 
major concerns." 
  "The Pilcomayo River is dwindling away and it is important 
for Paraguay, Bolivia, and Argentina," he said. 
  Regarding drug trafficking control, Sanchez de Losada said: 
"It is a very important subject, and we will speak about the 
Bolivian criteria to ask Argentina and the international 
community for help to put an end to this phenomenon, which is 
something we cannot stop." 
  He added that the future of Bolivia "depends a lot on what 
is 
going on in Argentina, on the possibility of increasing 
exchange, and on a rapprochement" between the two countries.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 15 Mar (NA) -- Japanese Deputy Foreign 
Minister Shozo Azuma today outlined a picture of diplomatic 
relations between his country and Latin American nations. He 
thoroughly praised the "gradual, sustained transit" to democracy 
and development, adding that he is confident these countries 
will in the short term establish strong ties with Pacific Basin 
and Asian nations. 
  During his visit to Congress, Azuma talked with NOTICIAS 
ARGENTINAS in perfect Spanish which, he said, he learned years 
ago during his stay in Mexico. 
  After meeting with Florencio Acenolaza, chairman of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, and with 
national Senators Juan Aguirre Lanari and Luis Leon in the 
Senate reading room, Azuma delivered a lecture on "Japanese 
policy in Latin America." 
  The Japanese diplomat said he "loved" Latin America. He said 
Argentina holds "the capital that is known as the most beautiful 
in Latin America, with good wine, good food, and the nicest and 
most sophisticated people." 
  During the day Azuma also met with President Carlos Menem, 
about whom he said that "we had a good talk; he met with us 
despite the fact that he was very busy." 
  He said he is confident that after the Argentine president's 
visit to Japan in December 1993 "political and economic 
relations between Japan and Argentina will be intensified." 
  Azuma gave particular praise to "the efforts to achieve 
democratization and to consolidate democracy under the excellent 
leadership of President Menem, and the results of political 
stability and the economic policy." 
  "I would also like to express our deepest respect for the 
attitude with which Argentina undertook the peacekeeping 
missions and a policy of nuclear non-proliferation," he added. 
  Azuma declined to give specific details of the commercial 
exchange with Argentina or of the support that his country has 
extended to Argentina in any area. However, he did so with 
respect to other Latin American nations in referring to the 
period of "the lost decade of the 1980's to the resurrection of 
the 1990's." 
  In his analysis, he emphasized the modifications made in the 
international arena with the end of the cold war and the 
East-West conflict. Upon referring to the Latin American and 
Caribbean nations, he said that in the current decade "they are 
engaged in dynamic movements like democratization, economic 
reforms, and the adoption of realistic diplomacies." 
  He said that in keeping with the new situation in Latin 
America, Japan hopes to "assure long-term stability, consolidate 
democracy and the market economy, and maintain and foment the 
international coordination system." 
  Azuma cleverly said that to attain such objectives Japan had 
adopted "policies that focus on the double `D' -- democracy and 
development -- supporting and promoting democracy in the region 
and cooperating with economic reforms based on the principles of 
the market economy." 
  Concerning Japanese cooperation with Latin American nations, 
Azuma said it is "substantial" in El Salvador, to which more 
than $200 million was given for the national reconstruction plan 
and for the democratization program which will end with the 
elections on 20 March. 
  He also said his country is supporting the Nicaraguan 
Government of Violeta Chamorro, which up to the end of 1992 has 
received economic and technical cooperation worth approximately 
$112 million. 
  In the case of Peru, he admitted that with the suspension of 
the Constitution by President Fujimori on 5 April 1992, the 
double "D" diplomatic policy "faced a dilemma," but "the reforms 
on which the Peruvian Government was working had decisive 
political and economic significance in the history of Peru, and 
gave extraordinary results, resolving many unprecedented 
difficulties." 
  While advocating the rapid return to democracy, Japan "did 
not miss the opportunity of cooperating in the fair and regular 
elections in November," Azuma said, adding that computers and a 
$1 million contribution were donated and observers sent as part 
of OAS delegations. 
  He praised the results of the Peruvian economic plan, and 
said that it has successfully reached a growth rate of 6.5 
percent, "which is the highest figure in Latin America." 
  Azuma admitted that in June 1993 the Japanese Government 
"temporarily" froze economic cooperation with Guatemala "until 
democracy was restored 10 days later under international 
pressure." 
  In Haiti, Japan enforced economic sanctions and demanded the 
return of democracy, and in April 1993 it gave $2.5 million to 
the United Nations to support the activities of the 
international mission of observers. Japan has also announced 
that if democracy returns to Haiti it will provide a $10 million 
financial contribution for refinancing the foreign debt. 
  Azuma finally expressed his desire that Latin American 
countries in the short term promote commercial and political 
ties with Asian and Pacific Basin countries.

<F P=106> [Article: "According to Labor: Privatization Plans Are </F>
Delaying Regional Development Projects"] 
  [Text] Railway and construction labor leaders fear that 
plans to privatize the state-owned ENFE [National Railway 
Enterprise] and ENDE [National Electricity Enterprise] companies 
will in effect nullify the two major projects on which the 
citizens of Cochabamba are counting, leaving the region 
frustrated and mired in a postponement of indefinite duration. 
  Alarm was voiced this weekend when construction labor 
leaders 
sought explanations for the government's repeated failures to 
advance and fund the Misicuni multiple project, which has been 
brought to a virtual halt, because the government considers the 
approximately $280 million cost of the investment impossible to 
finance through international institutions. 
  Construction labor leaders, who look to this project to 
provide jobs for their members, have begun to fear that the 
government's excuses for avoiding implementation of the Misicuni 
project are related to the government's plan to privatize ENDE. 
  "The government does not want the state-owned enterprises to 
incur bigger debts with the international institutions, because 
this could impede the auctioning or the public tender process 
with respect to the enterprises it is administering, such as 
ENDE," said COD [Departmental Workers Federation] leader Pedro 
Espinosa. 
  The Misicuni multiple project repeatedly has been declared a 
priority by different administrations, but none of them has 
succeeded in funding its implementation. 
  The first objective of the Misicuni project is to supply 
potable water to the population of Cochabamba, and to enable, as 
concomitant projects, the installation of a hydroelectric plant 
and the piping of the remainder of the Misicuni's waters to farm 
irrigation projects. 
  According to railway labor leaders, the government will take 
no action to obtain financing not only of the Misicuni project 
but of other projects as well, such as the Aiquile Santa Cruz 
railway interconnection project. 
  The ENFE is also part of the government's privatization 
plans, and the government therefore has very little interest in 
seeking financing for the railway project. 
  According to studies made by Sondotecnica of Brazil as 
consultants, the railway interconnection project would cost 
approximately $1 billion, although last year, a preliminary 
study by a Japanese mission in connection with a possible 
variant in the original design reduced the estimated cost to 
around $500 million. 
  "The government is gradually losing interest in pushing 
regional development projects, because it has other plans in 
mind, such as the privatization of state-owned enterprises; and 
seeking financing at this point in time would be prejudicial to 
its plans," said railway labor leader Erwin Carvallo. 
  Both officials indicated that other projects of regional 
interest are also in limbo, with little probability of 
implementation during the term of this administration. 
  "Its privatization policy is for the moment impeding any 
thought of financing the regional development projects," they 
said.

<F P=106> [Report by Carlos Santoyo from San Cristobal de Las Casas, </F>
Chiapas; from the "Acir Radio News" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] Indian and peasant organizations concluded a meeting 
in San Cristobal de Las Casas and announced an agreement to 
block roads, occupy government agency buildings related to 
agricultural and livestock production, and take over the Chamber 
of Deputies and congressional headquarters. Jorge Arturo Luna, 
a leader of the Independent Peasants Central Organization [CCI], 
reported that the peasant demand for greater participation in 
agricultural issues should be reinforced with enhanced grain 
crop yield and land tenure protection controls. Therefore, they 
say, Article 27 of the Constitution should be reformed. They 
added that Article 4 should also be changed to give Indian 
communities more rights and greater recognition of their worth 
and political participation nationwide. The peasant 
organizations announced that another national meeting will be 
held on 22 March in Mexico City. Agricultural and Indian 
organizations from all over the country will participate in this 
meeting. 
  The important thing now, though, is that the Catholic Church 
is said to be justifying the recent land invasions. We spoke 
with Father Joel Padron, parish priest of Simon Jovel, which is 
a community about three and one half hours away from San 
Cristobal de Las Casas. It is noteworthy that Fr. Joel Padron 
said that the hunger, poverty, and destitution among Indians and 
peasants is high and explained that this is why they are seeking 
some way to support their families. He added that the church 
has no part in the issue of land invasion or the armed movement 
of last January. He went on to say that the church is not to 
blame for the hunger and, especially, for the deaths of 
thousands of children, or for the indigence of thousands of 
Indians. Joel Padron also said that the church must also change 
is attitude, because it -- along with the political parties -- 
has been left behind by society in general and by a community 
that has organized itself to struggle in defense of its rights. 
  [Begin Padron recording] The civilian population is 
awakening 
with the events in Chiapas and claiming its rightful place. I 
believe the political parties must feel left behind by the 
civilian society. They have new challenges at every turn. How 
can they offer these discontented groups, who have been rejected 
for so long any truly dependable solutions? How can they 
respond to the civilian population? The community is capable of 
making a more constructive contribution to the peace process. I 
believe the civilian population, as such, which goes beyond any 
political party, does not respond to any specific group interest 
or any political interest. It is more interested in creating a 
new Mexico. [end recording] 
  He said that a new Chiapas should rise from the movement 
that 
began in January. It should become a new state where justice is 
pure; deprivation is left behind; peasants are given their 
rights, especially their right to speak out, because they were 
never allowed to do so. 
  Joel Padron added that one guarantee that must be secured in 
order to attain peace in this state is that the community in 
general be allowed to participate in the peace process. The 
church cannot remove itself from this process and must become a 
true promoter of peace, and never extricate itself. He 
responded to those critics who are calling for Monsignor Samuel 
Ruiz and himself to resign. Those demanding this are mistaken, 
because the church does not promote violence. Violence has 
appeared because of the hunger and poverty of thousands of 
people who are seeking some way to support their families.

<F P=106> [Report on Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio's </F>
official visit to Mexico City on 15 March; from the "24 Hours" 
newscast; passages within quotation marks are recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In the afternoon, President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio met with Mexican Government Secretary 
Jorge Carpizo and Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche. Later at 
a local hotel, he met with reporters and admitted that 
Guatemalan rebels could have provided guidance and weapons 
during the Chiapas conflict. 
  [De Leon] "Just today, we spoke with President Carlos 
Salinas 
de Gortari about the possible involvement of Guatemalans or 
other foreign nationals in the January events. As the defense 
minister has already said, we cannot deny that possibility." 
  During a dinner hosted by the Mexican leader and his wife to 
honor Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio and his 
coterie, President Salinas said economic development is a 
guarantee for peace. 
  [Salinas] "This is why it is important to maintain peace as 
an asset of unbreakable unity and a requirement for civilian 
coexistence. For Mexico and all Latin American countries, peace 
with justice is our most valuable heritage." 
  President De Leon Carpio was optimistic about signing a 
peace 
agreement thereby concluding three decades of war between the 
Guatemalan guerrillas and the Army. 
  [De Leon] "The conflict is such that it has hampered any 
possibility of growth and impaired all efforts of moving more 
swiftly toward sustained and sustainable development." 
  Mexican cabinet members and the Guatemalan delegation also 
attended the dinner offered by Mr. and Mrs. Salinas de Gortari 
in honor of the Guatemalan president and his wife, Maria Eugenia 
Morales de Leon Carpio.

  [Text] At a state dinner honoring Guatemalan President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
affirmed peace is essential in Mexico and all Latin America to 
ensure development, economic development, and civilized 
coexistence. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] There is no possibility of 
development without peace. That is why it is essential to 
protect peace as an unbreakable value of unity, as a requirement 
for civilized coexistence. [end recording] 
  Guatemala has experienced 30 years of violent confrontation, 
and Mexico experienced a social outburst in Chiapas State. The 
Mexican president said peace and social justice constitute the 
best legacy to future generations of the region. De Leon asked 
the Mexican people for their solidarity so his country can 
finish the peace and reconciliation process this year, a process 
under negotiation in our country. De Leon commented on the 
painful reality of underdevelopment, mainly among Indian groups. 
  [Begin De Leon recording] This way, it is clear a gap exists 
between Indian and ladino sectors, with the former experiencing 
the worst educational, economic, and political indexes. [end 
recording] 
  The anthems of the two countries set the tone of the 
official 
reception. In the National Palace central courtyard, the two 
presidents spoke in favor of giving a new boost to economic and 
political relations. 
  [Begin De Leon recording] We came to promote cultural, 
economic, and social cooperation, and to agree on the grounds 
for an equitable commerce accord. [end recording] 
  The two governments issued a joint communique pledging to 
make the fund for the development of Indian peoples operational 
soon.

  [Text] Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, 13 March -- Trade between 
Mexico and Canada surpassed 4 billion Canadian dollars in 1993. 
Ian Burchett, Canada's consul in Mexico City, said that the 
goal for 1994 is to even out the trade balance. 
  Currently, Canadian imports from Mexico are greater than its 
exports. However, Burchett noted that the interest showed by 
over 5,000 Canadian companies to do business with Mexicans 
within the framework of NAFTA will encourage Canadian exports. 
  Burchett told EL FINANCIERO NORESTE EMPRESARIAL that 
investors are conducting a huge advertising campaign in Mexico 
to increase their exports since Mexico stands out as Canada's 
leading commercial partner in Latin America. 
  Figures provided by the Canadian Consulate in Monterrey 
reveal that Canadian exports to Mexico from January to November 
1993 amounted to 714,254,000 Canadian dollars compared with 
710,298,000 million for the same period in 1992. For that same 
period, Canadian imports reached 3,289,591,000 Canadian dollars 
while they reached around 2,542,320,000 dollars during the same 
period in 1992. These figures reveal that the Canadian trade 
balance with Mexico has followed a positive trend. 
  In 1991, Canadian companies exported some 500 million 
dollars 
[as published] to Mexico while Canadian imports from Mexico were 
in the amount of 2,833,687,000 Canadian dollars. The Mexican 
market has been a priority for Canada, vis-a-vis other Latin 
American countries, even before implementation of NAFTA.

<F P=106> [Report by Zenon Escamilla and Georgina Solis] </F>
  [Text] While explaining his economic program yesterday in 
Nuevo Leon, Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta promised to seek new 
trade agreements with other regions, as well as to review and 
reform those circumstances that hinder national and foreign 
investment. 
  During a meeting with local businessmen and former ITESM 
[Monterrey Institute of Higher Technology] students, the PRI 
[Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate 
promised to consolidate economic stabilization and 
modernization, as well as to promote capital investment as a 
core goal of his economic program. 
  "The goal is to offer investors sufficient competitive 
conditions on an international level -- conditions that include 
favorable capital expenses, fiscal incentives, government 
regulations, infrastructure, and support in attracting human 
resources and technology." 
  In an address lasting more than 35 minutes, which was 
interrupted on nine separate occasions, Colosio Murrieta 
asserted that to achieve growth it is first necessary to 
consolidate macroeconomic stability while encouraging 
competition and microeconomic efficiency. 
  "I am deeply convinced we are at the dawn of a new phase of 
economic growth," Colosio Murrieta said. 
  According to the PRI presidential candidate, his program is 
designed to steer the economy in a steady, clear, and planned 
manner to achieve the fundamental economic development the 
country expects. 
  "I am determined to consolidate economic stabilization and 
modernization, and this will benefit every Mexican household, 
guarantee low inflation, preserve fiscal responsibility, and 
encourage structural changes." 
  He said his social program will face some of the most 
significant hurdles, because he is seeking to create more 
health, education, housing, and nutritional programs for the 
people, especially for Mexico's children and younger generation. 
  He called for sustained, shared, and balanced growth that 
will take into account environmental concerns before opening 
investment opportunities in Mexico. He also endorsed the 
promotion of domestic and foreign savings to spur investments. 
  Colosio also said he believes it is important to confront 
inequalities: "I have witnessed financial irresponsibility while 
millions of Mexicans were searching for productive employment. 
Financial irresponsibility is gone forever, never to return." 
  Participants in the event, which began at 1445, included Mr. 
Eugenio Garza Laguera, president of the ITESM Teaching and 
Higher Research Board of Directors, and his wife Eva Gonda de 
Garza Laguera. Also present were businessmen Alberto Santos de 
Hoyos, Eugenio Clariond Reyes, Javier Garza Sepulveda, Enrique 
Regules, and Alfonso Ramos, all of whom welcomed the PRI 
candidate. 
  At the start of his address, Colosio Murrieta stated that 
during his arrival in Monterrey he was reminded of his 
university years, and he fondly recalled Mr. Eugenio Garza Sada. 
He noted it was in Monterrey that he first seriously reflected 
on the economy. Nearly three decades later, he said, he can 
honestly say it was a privilege to study at ITESM. 
  Alfonso Ramos, one of the organizers of the event, said all 
of the participants pledged support for the PRI candidate. At 
the conclusion of the event, the PRI candidate received a small 
statue of a lamb -- the ITESM symbol.

  [Text] Paris -- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
considers negotiations with the Brazilian Government to be 
practically over, and it is only waiting for the arrival in 
Washington of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso to sign 
an agreement this week. The agreement will also permit the 
conclusion of negotiations over payment of the total $35 billion 
debt owed to private banks. 
  In addition, the conclusion of the longest and most 
difficult 
negotiations between the IMF and a Latin American country 
constitutes a green light from the IMF to open within the next 
few months a new phase in negotiations with the Paris Club. In 
Paris yesterday -- according to sources at the French Treasury, 
which is responsible for management of the Paris Club -- there 
was no doubt whatsoever as to the final success of the 
negotiations. The IMF directorate had already informally passed 
the information on to its European members. 
  Cardoso last week received a phone call from IMF Managing 
Director Michel Candessus, who gave assurances of the successful 
conclusion to the negotiations. The agreement, according to the 
same sources, also has strong political connotations, as has 
been disclosed in Europe -- Paris and London -- because the 
international financial community does not want to raise any 
obstacles to the second stage of the Cardoso plan, or even to 
the possible presidential candidacy of the finance minister. 
  This is not the first time that organs like the IMF and the 
Paris Club have adopted a position of this nature. They 
recently favored the Russian economic reforms of President Boris 
Yeltsin, who was politically threatened by Communists. 
  The second stage of the Cardoso plan was a major economic 
instrument in obtaining this favorable result, but the candidacy 
of Cardoso was also a major political factor. Since the plan 
was presented -- and even if some of the measures to fight 
inflation and the public deficit were not as drastic as might 
have been expected -- the prevailing trend has been to look for 
a solution leading to the rapid implementation of the program, 
evading possible obstacles that might jeopardize the minister's 
political position. This was prompted by concern over the 
probable victory of PT [Workers Party] candidate Luis Inacio 
Lula da Silva and a possible default on the foreign debt. 
  These sectors are alarmed about the position taken by the 
PT. 
The agreement with the IMF, therefore, is a major political 
victory for Cardoso, because it was obtained on the eve of his 
possibly stepping down to run for president. International 
financial circles expect that he will be replaced by someone who 
is well known and who is devoted to resolving domestic problems.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- The public sector will have a 
primary surplus equivalent to 4.5 percent of the GDP in 1994, or 
about $20.07 billion, including revenues and spending by 
federal, state, and municipal governments and the Social 
Security service. This information was released by Economic 
Policy Secretary Winston Fritsch. Shortly before leaving for 
Washington on 12 March, where he will prepare the final 
agreement between Brazil and the IMF, he reported that the 
surplus is the figure that was agreed upon with the mission that 
visited the country two weeks ago. After meeting Finance 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso on 16 March, IMF managing 
director Michel Camdessus should give the green light of 
approval for the Brazilian program, even before the IMF board 
makes a formal announcement. Camdessus should immediately notify 
the U.S. Treasury. Fristch expects that this will make the 
Treasury issue the bonds that will guarantee the foreign debt 
negotiations with foreign commercial banks, which will be 
concluded in April. Fristch said the primary surplus will be 
"strictly complied with" because the figures are "consistent and 
credible." 
  The surplus, he said, will be obtained thanks to the fiscal 
effort that reduced spending and capital costs, and increased 
revenues thanks to the fight against tax evasion. According to 
Fritsch, the program for the recovery of public utility rates 
was essential for arriving at this surplus of $20.07 billion 
because this recovery represented a significant improvement in 
the financial performance of state-run companies. 
  The program that Brazil will submit to the IMF presupposes 
that there will be currency stability, despite the fact that 
Fristch did not say when this stability will be accomplished. 
Fristch also referred to the evolution of inflation, exchange 
rates, interest, and spending that is burdened by interest. The 
surplus, he said, can become the basic source of funds for 
paying the interest owed by the government and for possible 
currency reserve increases.

<F P=106> [Article by Luiz Caversan] </F>
  [Text] Varig [Rio Grande do Sul Airline] -- the most 
important Brazilian airline, and the largest in South America -- 
yesterday announced it was suspending payments, for two months, 
on its "leasing" [preceding word in English] contract (rent with 
purchasing preference) on 50 of its planes. Varig President 
Rubel Thomas made the announcement in Rio de Janeiro. 
  Varig has grounded 80 of its planes, including Boeing and 
Mcdonnell-Douglas planes -- 50 of which are under "leasing" 
contracts. Thomas said the suspension of payments while 
contract periods and values are being renegotiated (which will 
be conducted by the Bankers Trust) is within the company's 
reorganization plan. The company has been accumulating losses 
since 1990. Last year it lost $380 million. 
  Varig pays $500 million for its planes annually. The 
two-month postponement will save $83 million. Thomas did not 
say exactly who the creditors are -- mentioning only that they 
are Japanese, Americans, and Europeans -- or how much it is owed 
to each. He said the payment due in March, which should have 
been deposited today, will not be made. 
  Thomas said the company has two types of "leasing" 
contracts: 
Operational contracts (with the manufacturer or its 
representative and includes a cash deposit), and financial 
contracts (the guarantee is the plane itself). Seventy percent 
of Varig's contracts are financial and 30 percent are 
operational (with deposits totaling $100 million). 
  Rubel Thomas said there are two reasons for "calling 
creditors for talks." He said the first is that currently 
"there is a large international offer of `leasing' contracts, 
and prices have dropped significantly. We are paying prices 
that were agreed when rates were much higher, and we need to 
renegotiate." 
  Second reason: In 1993 Varig had revenues of almost $2.5 
billion, of which only 19 percent, or $460 million, was 
available to cover investment costs. This is "insufficient to 
cover our investments," which total $500 million, Thomas said. 
  The Varig president said the company will delay payments for 
only two months. "Our domestic commitments will not be affected 
at all," Thomas said, adding that the 60 day period might even 
be reduced. "We want to conclude the negotiations as quickly as 
possible." 
  This type of maneuver is not common in Brazil, but Thomas 
stressed that difficulties have forced various foreign companies 
to renegotiate. He mentioned, among others, United Airlines, 
Continental, and SAS [Scandinavian Airlines System]. "Evergreen, 
for instance, is doing what we are doing now," he said. 
  "We will pay everything we owe and maintain all our 
commitments," Thomas stressed, recalling that during the 67 
years of Varig's existence the company "always honored its 
commitments." Thomas said: "Negotiations will be tough but 
necessary. I am convinced we are doing something serious and 
looking after the interests of shareholders and customers."

  [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso yesterday 
signed Resolution No. 118 allowing enterprises to issue bills, 
copies, and credit cards in URV's (real value units). The bills 
released by credit card enterprises may be issued in URV's. The 
Finance Ministry has warned that "there can be no price 
difference between the transactions made with credit cards and 
those made with checks or in cash." 
  Under the previous legislation, enterprises had to issue 
bills in real cruzeiros. "The resolution cancels the compulsory 
use of real cruzeiros in this type of document. Enterprises may 
use the URV, but they are not compelled to do so," Finance 
Ministry Economic Policy Secretariat member Roberto Padovani 
said. 
  State companies will not be allowed to collect utility rates 
through installments in URV's. Bills for electric power, water, 
telephone, stamps, mail services, and fuel purchases will 
continue to be issued in cruzeiros. 
  The copies, bills, and cards issued in URV's, even if valid 
for a period shorter than one month, will be paid in real 
cruzeiros by the URV value of the day on which the obligation 
comes due. Issuance in URV's will allow enterprises to exclude 
inflationary expectations from their transactions in 
installments. 
  Since no inflation is expected to grow in URV's, the most 
that enterprises can do is include a small interest rate in the 
sales in installments. It is as if it were the price in cash 
plus the interest. 
  Receipts issued by enterprises will continue to be in real 
cruzeiros. Merchandise prices will continue to be expressed in 
real cruzeiros. The only thing that changed is the possibility 
of including on a bill or copy the total value of the 
transaction in URV's. The receipts giving rise to a bill must 
be issued in real cruzeiros. 
<H5>  Impasse </H5>
  The lack of clear rules for the use of the URV made 
retailers 
and industrialists adopt opposing positions, while stores were 
half paralyzed. The day before yesterday the larger Sao Paulo 
supermarkets agreed on a deflation formula to orient the 
introduction of the URV. The proposal by retailers, which was 
formulated by Carrefour during a meeting that was also attended 
by representatives of the Pao de Acucar, Se, Eldorado, Peralta, 
and Tulha networks, is the following: Take the credit price set 
by suppliers in February, remove the 48 percent financial cost, 
and pay in 28 days, corrected by the URV. 
  With this formula, the March price list will have prices 
that 
will be 6 percent lower than the average of the last four-month 
period of 1993. 
  Industry representatives who yesterday talked with FOLHA -- 
and who asked not to be identified -- said that the proposal was 
"indecent." They argued that no one lends money for the 
industrial sector to finance its operational capital in URV's. 
According to their figures, the February financial cost 
remained below 48 percent. 
  Up until yesterday, the industrial and the retail sectors 
had 
ruled out the possibility of a supply shortage. Yet FOLHA 
learned that some products can be in short supply if 
negotiations are not resumed at their normal rate as of next 
week. 
  The decentralized stores of the Pao de Acucar network, which 
have reduced stocks, have already been authorized to restock 
from the deposits of the Brazilian Distribution Company, which 
supplies products to centralized management stores. Other 
supermarkets are making their purchases from wholesalers. 
  Carlos Eduardo Toro, of the Colgate-Palmolive company, 
believes that negotiations in URV will become feasible as soon 
as the government clarifies the taxation procedure. 
  "We already have a table for negotiating in URV's, but 
without clear rules on how taxes will be collected the table 
cannot be enforced," Toro said.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Casado] </F>
  [Text] Brazil has turned into an immense unfinished 
construction site. For example, there are 28 electric plants 
under construction with an average 10-year delay to begin 
operation. This includes cases of hydroelectric plants whose 
construction began 33 years ago, during the Juscelino Kubitschek 
administration, and are not even half finished. 
  One of the main reasons for the accumulation of the 
countless 
unfinished projects is the constant change of administrative 
direction as a result of the succession of governments in the 
presidency, states, and municipalities. 
  Recent research by the Secretariat of Planning and 
Coordination of the Presidency of the Republic (Seplan) 
determined the consequences of delays in 77 major infrastructure 
projects built in partnership with the World Bank and the 
Inter-American Development Bank. 
  They represent $21.6 billion in foreseen investments -- 
equivalent to two-thirds of the national hard currency reserves 
the country currently has. 
  Nearly half of the projects have been under construction for 
more than four years, and have cost $10.5 billion so far. Their 
costs also have doubled. 
  Most of the projects have not even gone further than plans 
on 
paper, and they already have $11.1 billion of contracted loans 
with the two aforementioned banks. Brazil is paying fines and 
interest for the delays. 
  Political interests weigh on the definition of the 
construction pace of public federal, state, or municipal 
infrastructure projects. 
  The projects were chosen based on electoral interests. They 
are funded based on the degree of influence the suppliers of 
equipment and services have on the government. The result is an 
unheard-of crumbling of unfinished projects. 
  Sao Paulo State has the largest "stock" of highway projects 
in Brazil: Two-thirds are at a standstill and cost $2.6 billion. 
  In northeastern Brazil, about 150 water reservoirs have been 
under construction for the past 12 years to provide water in 
regions where the drought is relentless. Last year, Congress 
incorporated an additional 95 reservoirs in the National 
Department of Drought Control (DNOCS) budget. 
  Three months ago, DNOCS told the National Accounting Office 
(TCU) that it totally ignores about 62 of the 197 projects it is 
financing. 
  A high price is being paid for the constant change of 
government direction on infrastructure projects. 
  That is what happened, for example, in the construction of 
one of the main hydroelectric plants in Sao Paulo State, the 
Tres Irmaos. It has been under construction for the past 10 
years and needs 60 percent more equipment to generate energy. It 
already has cost more than $2 billion. 
  Some plants have been under construction for more than two 
decades. That is the case of Cachoeira Dourada in Goias and 
Coaracy Nunes in Amapa. Construction started during the 
Kubitschek administration. According to the Seplan, these 
projects are not half-finished yet. 
  Pedra do Cavalo in Bahia has been under construction for 15 
years. The last of the general presidents, Joao Batista de 
Figueiredo, even visited it to "dedicate" the construction of 
the dam on the Paraguacu River. The dam is there. But it has not 
produced a single kilowatt yet. 
  There also exist projects that make progress only during 
election time. The Sao Paulo subway system is exemplary: The 
work sites of the 15 construction companies building this 
project worked feverishly a year ago before the elections for 
mayor. 
  Since then, the northern subway line has been paralyzed, 
waiting for more money for the engineering work and, mainly, for 
the trains ($120 million). 
  The Sao Paulo government has planned its inauguration for 
this year when elections for president, governors, senators, and 
deputies will be held. 
  In northeastern Brazil there is the case of a great 
irrigation project (Araras-Norte) on which $70 million was spent 
to send water to farmers in the interior of Ceara State in one 
of the regions most affected by the drought. Its construction 
has been paralyzed for the past five years. 
  Ninety-five percent of the projects were built. But $7 
million is necessary for their completion. The long delay has 
caused the loss of the irrigation canals before they ever sent a 
single drop of water to farmland in Araras-Norte. 
  During that period the federal government began 56 other 
water supply and irrigation projects in the northeast. They are 
all small projects, but large enough to maintain the political 
interests of the region as well as the highly profitable drought 
businesses where construction companies are building reservoirs 
overvalued by more than 300 percent, as verified by the TCU 
during its last audit of DNOCS contracts.

  [Text] In a joint declaration Paraguayan President Juan 
Carlos Wasmosy and Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada 
last night described the Pilcomayo River and the areas around it 
as a decisive factor in promoting integration among Argentina, 
Bolivia, and Paraguay, and decided to invite Argentine President 
Carlos Saul Menem to a meeting with a view to seeking formulas 
that would be instrumental in jointly undertaking mutually 
beneficial development projects. 
  Paraguay and Bolivia also stated that they are committed to 
fighting the drug trade, and agreed to hold permanent 
consultations between senior officers of their two countries. 
The Paraguayan Government supports "the search for a negotiated 
agreement" to provide Bolivia with an outlet to the Pacific 
Ocean. Sanchez de Lozada has characterized this goal as "an 
unrenounceable right of the Bolivian people." 
  In the joint declaration, which was signed at Lopez Palace, 
Wasmosy and Sanchez de Lozada attached special significance to 
the Pilcomayo River, but did not go into detail. They agreed, 
however, to invite President Menem to a joint meeting to 
undertake joint projects. They have not set any specific date 
for this meeting. They have also acknowledged that the abuse of 
and illegal trade in narcotics and dangerous substances are a 
serious threat to the health and well-being of all peoples, and 
noted that all nations must assume their share of responsibility 
in fighting this scourge at every level and in all of its forms. 
They reiterated their commitment to fighting the drug trade, 
and agreed to urgently implement bilateral actions. 
  To strengthen friendly relations and cooperation between 
their two countries, they have decided -- based on a proposal 
from the Bolivian Government -- to hold consultations between 
senior officers of their respective Armed Forces, through 
periodic meetings to be held at least once a year, alternating 
in Bolivia and Paraguay. 
  Regarding the gas pipeline, Wasmosy and Sanchez de Lozada 
emphasized the work of the energy technical commission that is 
studying the sale to Paraguay of Bolivian natural gas through 
the gas pipeline project, of liquefied gas, and of gasoline. 
They conveyed their desire to have the project implemented as 
soon as possible with the participation of the private sectors 
of both countries. 
  They also expressed their satisfaction over the progress and 
consolidation of the democratic system both in the world and 
within the region. They regard this as a guarantee for the full 
exercise of human rights and a necessary condition for achieving 
socioeconomic development. 
  They also mentioned the efforts made to find formulas that 
would enable Bolivia to gradually move closer to and join 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. 
  They agreed on the need to strengthen the Agreement on 
Coordination and Cooperation among Bolivia, Paraguay, and 
Uruguay (Urupabol), which was reactivated on 16 October 1993, 
and emphasized the consultations taking place among the three 
countries with a view to holding, as soon as possible, a meeting 
of their three foreign ministers. 
  Among other points, President Wasmosy informed his Bolivian 
counterpart that the Paraguayan Government is studying a project 
to build a dam in Bahia Negra to check the Paraguay River water 
flow. He noted that this project will generate a development 
process in vast areas in the region, will make the river 
navigable along its entire course, and will decrease ecological 
risks. 
  They also stated that it would be useful to improve customs 
monitoring at their common border. A customs office will be set 
up in General Garay. Sanchez de Lozada stated that the goal of 
obtaining a sovereign outlet to the Pacific Ocean is a 
fundamental topic in Bolivian foreign policy, and "an 
unrenounceable right of the Bolivian people." Wasmosy voiced 
his government's unwavering support in the search for a 
negotiated agreement on this issue.

  [Text] Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis Ramirez Boettner 
and his Bolivian counterpart Antonio Aranibar Quiroga yesterday 
ratified seven cooperation agreements, among which are one 
creating mechanisms for the recovery of stolen vehicles, and one 
for the supply of Bolivian natural gas to Paraguay. The 
documents were signed by the two foreign ministers during a 
ceremony attended by Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy 
and Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada at Government 
Palace. 
  The other cooperation agreements refer to the economy, 
natural resources, the environment, health, the duty free 
warehouse in Villeta, and tourism issues. 
  All these agreements were signed during the last visit 
President Wasmosy made to Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, some 
months ago. 
<H5>  Stolen Vehicles </H5>
  According to the agreement on the recovery of stolen 
vehicles, the two countries promise a smooth exchange of 
information between their respective police forces regarding the 
owners of the vehicles, the reports of theft to the police, and 
details of the stolen vehicles. 
  The accord also establishes the need for a document 
certifying that the vehicle has not been reported as stolen and 
listing the highways and checkpoints which the vehicle is 
authorized to use. 
  Other preventive measures mentioned in the agreement refer 
to 
constant patrolling, checking of vehicles, and the establishment 
of consultation offices in both countries in their respective 
police stations. 
<H3>  Establishment of Grounds for the Construction of a Gas 
Pipeline </H3>
  The agreement for the supply of Bolivian natural gas to 
Paraguay is partial, although of an "indefinite duration" and 
for a volume yet to be determined. 
  The two countries have agreed to authorize the construction 
and operation of a gas pipeline between the two countries, as 
well as for the transportation of gas within their own 
territories. 
  The purchase of gas will be made through operators who will 
be in charge of the negotiations and of establishing the price, 
deadlines, volume, and other pertinent details. Payments will 
be made in dollars. 
<H5>  Economic Cooperation </H5>
  The economic cooperation agreement is basically designed to 
step up economic and commercial relations through the 
elimination of non-tariff barriers on bilateral trade, and to 
promote the expansion and diversification of trade between the 
two countries. 
<H5>  Natural Resources </H5>
  As for the agreement referring to natural resources and 
environment, it provides for the exchange of technicians, 
professors, and experts for the drafting of joint programs as 
well as the exchange of information regarding methods and 
techniques. 
<H5>  Tourism Cooperation </H5>
  The tourism cooperation agreement, among other issues, 
provides for regional and subregional integration, the 
coordination of promotion events, the consolidation of 
integrated tourism circuits, the identification and 
consolidation of a land and river corridor between the two 
countries, as well as the promotion of integrated tourist 
circuits in the international markets. 
<H5>  Villeta Duty Free Warehouse </H5>
  The two ministers also signed an agreement for the exchange 
of reversal notes authorizing the rendering of services for 
cargo in transit, for Bolivian cargo in transit and to the 
Paraguayan market, and for Paraguayan cargo bound for Bolivia. 
The Bolivian Government has offered the Paraguayan Government a 
duty free warehouse and storage area in a site yet to be chosen, 
under the same terms granted by Paraguay to Bolivia. 
<H5>  Health </H5>
  The cooperation agreement in this field is designed to 
establish an exchange of knowledge and experience, to step up 
the training of human resources, establish an information 
service on the activities held on the border areas, and adopt 
regular notification mechanisms on illnesses that must be 
reported.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada </F>
by Stella Ruffinelli; from the "Coordinates" program; place not 
given -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Ruffinelli] You have said that 
consensus represents a basic element for strengthening our 
democratic processes. Before your election, you had to achieve 
a mini-consensus to guarantee your second attempt to become 
president. How do you view this now you are president? How can 
a consensus be achieved? 
  [Sanchez] Well, political dynamics, especially as we see it 
in Europe, involves opposition politics, that is, the 
opposition, the ruling party, and all that. 
  Nevertheless, there comes a time when a consensus must be 
reached, and many criticized me over this when I was in the 
opposition. 
  Through fraud and the fact that the second placed party 
voted 
for those placed third, if a majority vote is not achieved in 
Bolivia, you have to resort to Congress. It is almost 
impossible to achieve an absolute majority. 
  [Ruffinelli] You were elected by Congress. 
  [Sanchez] Yes, even though my election, my victory, was 
overwhelming -- I received 15 percent more than the second 
placed candidate. In a proportional representation vote system, 
it is impossible to receive more than 50 percent of the votes. 
Yet the Bolivian Constitution states that if you do not receive 
an absolute majority of the votes, you have to resort to 
Congress. 
  [Ruffinelli] Do you have the support of two thirds of the 
Senate? 
  [Sanchez] Yes. 
  [Ruffinelli] And a good portion or a significant portion of 
the Chamber of Deputies? 
  [Sanchez] We have an absolute majority in the Chamber of 
Deputies. A consensus is required when you draft significant 
measures to really transform society. Privatizations, the 
people's participation program, and education reform are 
revolutionary measures that the people eagerly want, but many 
people, especially the teachers, oppose it. When you design 
significant measures to transform society, a consensus is 
required. This does not mean it must be unanimous, but a 
consensus is essential because it is not enough to have a 
majority in Congress. All parties must decide that the time to 
reach an agreement has come. We will never agree on every 
measure because a government has to rule. These are significant 
measures which involve the changes and transformations required 
by current times -- because these are times of change -- and we 
must try to achieve a consensus. 
  [Ruffinelli] Emphasis has also been placed on the corruption 
issue and how to handle it. You have drug trafficking and other 
fairly difficult measures to solve. How are you handling the 
corruption issue? 
  [Sanchez] We believe the privatizations program will help to 
solve the corruption problem. Under a pluralist democratic 
process, we believe it is incompatible for the state to manage 
economic activities. If you manage state-owned enterprises 
well, you may not lose votes because you will be firing people 
and running the operation very efficiently. If you manage them 
poorly, if you start hiring your fellow party members, the 
enterprise will perform poorly and the services will be lousy. 
This is also bad. 
  We believe it is necessary to radically decentralize our 
country, to remove the state from economic activities, 
transferring them the private area. We must do it through 
privatizations in which the enterprises are not sold to foreign 
capital or directly to private capital, but in which the people 
themselves participate. 
  Second, with this participation of the people, certain roles 
will be transferred to the municipal governments and others to 
rural communities and urban neighborhoods. Like this we believe 
we will achieve the dynamics needed to exercise control. When 
the people control, there is no corruption. In a neighborhood 
or a small town, the people know exactly what is being done and 
who is doing it. We believe this mechanism of decentralization, 
through the people's participation in privatizations, will allow 
them to control. This is not merely a moral or personal 
problem, it is an institutional problem. 
  When there is excessive centralization, it is very difficult 
to control, regardless of the government's good intentions and 
efforts. 
  [Ruffinelli] I want to return to the trafficking issue, 
because it also is somewhat linked to what is happening here. 
Concerning the coca issue, you are, let's say, free to grow it, 
but not to process it. But the United States wants it 
eradicated. 
  [Sanchez] There are regions in Bolivia where coca was being 
grown before the arrival of the Spaniards. This coca, however, 
is very special. It is grown in high-altitude regions. This 
coca requires hard work. It is carefully grown, harvested, and 
dried. 
  There are other new regions where another type of coca is 
grown, a coca that is unsuitable for the traditional purpose of 
chewing or in typical Bolivian rites. This coca is used by 
traffickers. 
  We are now trying to control it and convince Bolivians to 
voluntarily replace coca with alternative development crops. It 
also involves paying them for each hectare they eradicate. It 
is not easy because it is not easy to find a crop that will 
really replace coca production. Nevertheless, we must wage this 
war because, thank God, the narco-guerrillas and drug cartels 
have not yet reached Bolivia. We are very scared because we had 
a military government that was totally at the service of drug 
trafficking. 
  [Ruffinelli] [Former Bolivian President Luis] Garcia Meza's 
detention in Brazil has probably created a little problem for 
your government. Even though it is a relief, it also represents 
a little problem. In Brazil, he said he did not govern alone. 
Coming from a former president, this is politically 
significant. What does this mean to you? 
  [Sanchez] We believe corruption cannot be concealed and, if 
he has something to say, I would be pleased to hear it. It is 
also necessary to be very careful about reports from a man 
sentenced by the Supreme Court to 30 years in prison, and who 
has been at large. 
  [Ruffinelli] But there still are pockets of authoritarianism 
and corruption that have not been removed from the Bolivian 
society. 
  [Sanchez] Obviously. There are many, but I want to tell you 
that my party, the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement, reached 
the government in 1985, through our leader and founder Victor 
Paz Estenssoro. We inherited a 23,400-percent hyperinflation ... 
  [Ruffinelli, interrupting] Was it your program or was it a 
program ...? 
  [Sanchez] Well now, a program ... [pauses] He transferred me 
from the Senate presidency to the Planning and Coordination 
Ministry, and we were able to curtail hyperinflation. 
  I have become president and there is hyper-corruption. I 
will not be able to totally wipe out corruption, because it has 
been imbued in humanity since Eve gave Adam an apple. This will 
not ... [pauses] We do not want hyper-corruption. We want 
single-digit corruption, controllable corruption in which 
coexistence is possible. 
  [Ruffinelli] You do not want it to become a standard. 
  [Sanchez] Correct. As I have just said, we do not want 
hyper-corruption. We do not want such serious corruption. Yet, 
it is not easy. As with hyperinflation and inflation, 
corruption must be reduced with very radical, clear, and 
unrelenting measures. By the time I leave the government, I 
hope to leave a country in which corruption has not entirely 
been wiped out, but where it has been reduced to a level that 
can be managed and controlled by the courts and society. 
  [Ruffinelli] President Sanchez de Lozada, there is a little 
point of common interest between our countries, that is, the 
issue of stolen cars and the concern over their legalization in 
your country. There was even one group who wanted to write a 
little letter on this issue and deliver it to you. Can you tell 
our audience, which is so interested in this issue, about this? 
  [Sanchez] I believe we will solve this point because we want 
all urban and rural municipal governments to responsibly 
participate in this municipalization program. When they see 
stolen vehicles, we want the municipal governments, not just the 
police and the courts ... [pauses] We will launch a campaign, 
with the people's assistance, because it is very harmful to 
Paraguay and is not benefiting us. We would like to resolve 
this point, and we are here to discuss ways to resolve this 
problem because it irritates, damages, and invalidates our 
efforts. [passage omitted]

  [Text] OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares will arrive 
in Buenos Aires at the highest point in the dispute over his 
succession. Two weeks before the elections of a new OAS 
secretary general, no diplomat dares make public his forecast of 
the election results. For the time being, the firm candidates 
are Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus Quesada and 
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria. The only clear indication is 
that the Colombian candidate has a heavyweight vote: that of the 
United States. 
  Argentina had promised to support the Costa Rican foreign 
minister. But two months ago President Carlos Menem informed 
Gaviria over the phone that if he presented his candidacy he 
could count on Argentine support. Following this change of 
decision, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella had to make another 
phone call to explain to his Costa Rican counterpart the reasons 
for the change. 
  According to Argentine ambassador to the OAS, Hernan Patino 
Mayer, Di Tella argued that the decision to support Gaviria's 
candidacy changed the whole panorama and forced a 
reconsideration of the former Argentine position. Argentina also 
toyed with the possibility of presenting an Argentine candidate: 
the former Radical Civic Union foreign minister, Dante Caputo. 
But Caputo's candidacy was never made official because the 
requisite was that he comply with his mission as UN and OAS 
mediator in restoring democracy in Haiti before the elections 
for secretary general. 
  The Colombian president, whose four-year mandate expires in 
August, has the support of nearly all the Latin American 
countries, except for Venezuela and Chile. He also has the 
support of the United States, Mexico, and Canada. 
  Venezuela has not promised its vote to any of these two firm 
candidates because it has not yet withdrawn the candidacy of its 
own foreign minister, Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas, the one with 
the least support so far. Most of the Central American and 
Caribbean countries have promised their support to the Costa 
Rican candidate. 
  Costa Rican diplomacy has established the current dispute 
with the current Colombian president on the terms of a 
confrontation between regions, that is, between small and large 
countries. Costa Rica points out that since the OAS' foundation 
there has never been a Central American or Caribbean secretary 
general. The first OAS secretary general was Alberto Lleras 
Camargo from Colombia. He was followed by Carlos Davila from 
Chile, Jose Mora from Uruguay, Galo Plaza from Ecuador, 
Alejandro Orfila from Argentina, and Joao Baena Soares from 
Brazil, who has been secretary general since 1984. 
  According to Ambassador Patino Mayer, the Costa Rican 
approach is incorrect because, he said, the secretary general is 
elected based on his background and never on the country he 
comes from. That is why, he added, Argentina favors President 
Gaviria, because he is a politician who has been very successful 
in the fight against drug trafficking with the arrest of Pablo 
Escobar Gaviria, he made progress in the field of human rights, 
and he is leaving the presidency following elections won by a 
candidate from his own political party. 
  "We think we have enough votes to win the elections," 
Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin Rubio said on 15 March. 
This belief is shared by the Argentine Foreign Ministry.

  [Text] Manaus (Brazil), 14 Mar (EFE) -- The Manaus Federal 
Police Superintendency reported today that the armed forces of 
Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Peru have been invited by 
Brazil to join a large operation to block the drug trafficking 
mafia operating in the Amazon River basin. 
  Superintendent Mauro Sposito said the plan was presented to 
those countries during the Sixth Military Exchange Meeting of 
the Armed Forces held in Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira last week. 
  Sposito said Venezuela already has confirmed its 
participation in the campaign that will be named the "Blocking 
Operation" [Operacion Bloqueo] and Colombia hinted that it also 
will support it. 
  The Manaus (capital of Amazonas State) police superintendent 
explained that the plan includes the establishment of an 
information network among the armed forces of the countries 
sharing the Amazon basin. 
  Sposito added that in Brazil the operation will cover all 
the 
federal organizations in Amazonas State and the national and 
multinational fuel distribution companies. Sposito said 200 
Federal Police officers will work exclusively on the operation. 
  Sposito also indicated that the "Blocking Operation" has the 
basic purpose of fighting drug trafficking at the Brazilian 
border with the other four countries. 
  Brazil also intends to be excluded from the list of 
countries 
used as transit routes by international drug traffickers. 
Sposito pointed out that Brazil and Venezuela have become the 
first countries on the cocaine route that starts in Colombia and 
ends in the United States and Europe. 
  Therefore, said Sposito, the Colombian Armed Forces' 
participation will be essential for the operation's success. 
  The "Blocking Operation" seeks to intercept the flow of 
cocaine on the Amazon River by integrating the Brazilian river 
police patrols in Tabatinga (at the Colombian border) with the 
Manaus police. 
  The operation also includes a follow-up by Brazil on actions 
against drug traffickers in Colombia. 
  Strict air traffic control in the Amazon region that 
includes 
the destruction of fuel supply networks and clandestine 
airfields, as well as the neutralization of the air space in the 
large Amazon basin, are the main aspects of the "Blocking 
Operation." 
  The operation also will include two radio centers, which 
began operating last November, in Tabatinga and Tefe (Amazonas 
State) to intercept the drug trafficking routes.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The New Inflation Rate"] </F>
  [Text] Inflation was 1.8 percent in February. This 
undoubtedly is positive news, because the trend of such an 
important economic indicator remained stable for the second 
consecutive month, even though it should be pointed out that a 
great effort must be made to lower the cost of living in order 
to attain the officially announced annual goal of a maximum 25 
percent. 
  In fact, the average cost of the family basket between 
September 1993 and February has not experienced major changes 
(only around 0.2 percent), no sudden variations, which 
represents a major stabilization achievement when taking into 
account that this was during a period when inflation grew 
significantly due to seasonal factors, such as the beginning of 
the school year and the fact that March is the deadline for tax 
payments. 
  All this is very positive because, despite a series of 
political factors such as the specific case of the "Cantuta 
Law," the economic and production agents basically show 
confidence in the government's economic model. 
  However, what we consider substantive warnings must be made. 
  First, inflation during the past two years has experienced 
an 
invariable percentage of about 2 percent per month. That, 
intrinsically speaking, is not bad for a national situation such 
as ours. It indicates, however, that one of the needs of the 
structural adjustment model is to invigorate the market's 
reaction, not only be expediting reforms but also by what is 
implicit: reactivate the market. 
  Through January, according to the INEI [National Institute 
of 
Statistics and Information Science], the GDP had grown 9.7 
percent; the mining industry accounts for a larger percentage of 
this growth, which needs to spread to the entire industrial 
sector. 
  This means, therefore, that this year emphasis must be 
placed 
on increasing competitiveness. The economic reactivation must 
spread to all productive sectors by two means: by the 
establishment of regulations allowing national industries to 
become fully competitive, not only at a national level, but also 
at a regional level, because one cannot forget that the 
reconversion must unavoidably be projected into large economies. 
  It also should be taken into account that inflation must be 
fought through tax collection. So that Peruvian enterprises can 
recover -- and, therefore, reduce their costs and the prices of 
goods and services -- it is not only necessary to lower the tax 
burden but also expand taxes and tariffs to more goods and 
services, thus avoiding illegal trade and contraband. 
  From another viewpoint, in order to make the struggle 
against 
inflation successful (and so, in turn, its monthly average 
drops) the Economy and Finance Ministry program must widen its 
scope so it channels the huge funds being received by the AFP 
[Pension Fund Administration Board] and the CTS [Severance Pay 
Fund] in a more rapid and effective manner so the financial and 
banking systems can make better and faster investments. 
  It should be pointed out, however, that the accumulation of 
resources is not always positive if it is not designed to 
accumulate international reserves. 
  The same goes for the funds being obtained through the 
privatization of public enterprises. For example, the money -- 
which up to a point was unexpected in the case of the sale of 
the CPT [Peruvian Telephone Company] and Entel [National 
Telecommunications Enterprise] -- must be earmarked for adequate 
and profitable social projects because if not, we may soon find 
that the foreign currency is converted into national currency 
with an eventual negative impact on the inflation rate. 
  An additional aspect is, precisely, that the monetary policy 
must continue to be administered with great care. We must not 
forget that 80 percent of the primary monetary supply is 
expressed and endorsed in dollars. And if the resources are not 
used with full guarantees and in a profitable manner in the 
short and medium term, we could be faced with inflation 
nourished by strictly monetary factors or by an exaggerated 
increase of expectations. 
  Moreover, and it is good to point out, although we are on a 
good footing, especially compared to the previous government, 
the essential thing in order to avoid a price increase and other 
concomitant factors is to avoid new political changes. 
  When political instability is generated -- 1994 is an 
electoral year -- the expectations of the productive and 
financial agents may become excessive and cause an increase in 
the cost of living that, under current circumstances, would be 
extremely negative. 
  Therefore, in sum, currently Peru is on the right path in 
its 
struggle against the inflation monster. However, what is 
worrisome is the fact that after four years of government, its 
economic model, which undoubtedly has its positive aspects, 
especially in the market liberalization, continues to follow an 
extremely slow pace that must not last much longer. 
  Regardless of the unchanged indicators for a few months, 
reforms must be implemented expeditiously, not only to attain 
the 25 percent inflation rate per year, but also to minimize or 
eliminate as soon as possible the social cost this will entail 
and the threat of recurring inflation. 
  The average inflation rate considered acceptable in Latin 
American countries is established, in acceptable and even 
optimum terms, at nine points per year. This must be our goal 
in the short term because, becasue we are drawing closer to the 
general elections, we must avoid the resurfacing of economic 
scourges of the past.

  [Text] Diplomatic relations between the Czech Republic and 
Peru were further consolidated with the recent signature of two 
bilateral agreements. This was stated by Czech Republic Vice 
President Jan Kalvoda, who has been in Peru since 15 March on an 
official visit. 
  One of the agreements signed will promote and guarantee 
investments, which will benefit financial exchange, especially 
for national development products. The other agreement 
eliminates the requirement for visas for diplomatic passports. 
  During a news conference, the Czech vice president pointed 
out the trade exchange with Peru, which he described as 
important and balanced.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Vaticano's Network"] </F>
  [Excerpts] In the purist Cali Cartel style, the web of the 
relationships of the organization headed by Vaticano covers 
every flank--financial, police, military, terrorist, judicial, 
and operational. 
  A comparison of information from various sources has made it 
possible to determine the table of organization that is detailed 
on these pages. It is very striking to see the levels of 
closeness since apparently even the agents of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) have been the subject of 
intelligence leaks pertaining precisely to the control 
operations carried out in Huallaga. 
  One of the brothers of Vaticano (so-called because he is the 
head of all of the "churches," or firms), namely Elias Chavez 
Penaherrera (aka Lan Chile), was the man in charge of the 
"payments" made to the military. This was because his work--the 
coordination of the receipt and dispatch of drugs by air--could 
only be carried out in this way. One of these payments may have 
been the gray automobile delivered to a general whose 
involvement in this relationship has been proven,, according to 
reliable information. Elias, who was formerly in charge of 
logistics in Campanilla, is now reported to have replaced his 
brother and to be in Cali. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  "I Know Nothing" </H5>
  The statement "I am his brother, but I know nothing," which 
was made by Manuel, the brother of Reynaldo Rodriguez Lopez, at 
the time of his arrest, has become famous. 
  Vaticano has said the following about his brothers: 
  "...Humberto lives in Campanilla, and he devotes his time to 
livestock breeding and music. He has a group called "La Banda 
del Caribe" (The Caribbean Band). Emilio lives in Campanilla, 
and is engaged in farming and livestock breeding. Berzabeth 
lives in Campanilla. She devotes herself to her housekeeping, 
and is married to a former policeman, Silverio Cardenas. Bertha 
lives in Lima and works in a grocery. Elias lives in Campanilla, 
but I do not know what he does." Where the others are concerned, 
he says that he has not seen them in a long time. 
  His sister Bertha, for her part, also said in her statement 
to the police that "I have not seen my brother for more than 10 
years now." 
  But her relationships were business ones, even more than 
family ones. Bertha (La Calena) was the general director of the 
organization, and she was apparently in charge of the process of 
laundering the money. The operations of "LR y Asociados" (LR and 
Associates) are being traced in an effort to prove this. 
  This business, which was established in March of 1992 by 
Mrs. 
Lucila Emetria Rivera de la Cruz, a housewife (55,100 shares), 
and her daughter, Claudia Luna Victoria Rivera, a student (2,900 
shares), was engaged in the construction of commercial centers 
in Lima. Vaticano has said that in May of 1991, he sold a plot 
of land measuring 1,100 square meters that he had purchased in 
Block 51 of the Benavides Extension, Surco, "to a woman whose 
name I do not remember." 
  This woman was none other than the mother-in-law of his 
sister Bertha. Mrs. Lucila Emetria is the mother of Marcos Ivan 
Luna Victoria Rivera, Bertha's common-law husband, who also 
lived at Bertha's minimarket and home complex at 3373 Avenida 
Aviacion. Her son was sentenced this week to 12 years in prison 
by the First Criminal Court of Callao for illegal trafficking in 
drugs. "La Calena" has told the police that she never realized 
she was living with a drug trafficker. 
<H5>  Figureheads </H5>
  Having set up their business in the commercial center they 
had built on the 1,100-meter plot in question, the mother and 
daughter hired a manager, Yuri Marcel Munoz Rivera. He too is 
one of Mrs. Lucila Emetria's sons, and, having been linked with 
Luna Victoria in this way might also have played other roles. 
  In the first place, it has been proven that he visited 
"Panama," Bertha's minimarket on Avenida Aviacion. In November 
of last year, he traveled to Trujillo. There he is reported to 
have collected money (the sum of $40,000 has been mentioned), 
which he brought back to Lima and delivered to his sister 
Terlinda. She made a trip to Iquitos, presumably to pay off 
Judge Jaime Cardenas Fonseca, the brother of "Mosca Loca" (Crazy 
Fly), for the release of Bertha. It was Vaticano, who met with 
Terlinda in Iquitos for purposes of coordination, who gave the 
order for the operation. 
  LR y Asociados SRL (LR and Associates, Ltd.) built the "Las 
Gardenias" commercial center on the plot of land purchased from 
Vaticano, and leased all of the shops. In this way, the property 
(land and buildings) was valued at more than $1 million. In 
1992, however, LR sold the entire complex to two men for a 
little more than $100,000. And the land alone had cost $65,000 
when they bought it from Demetrio. 
  It is suspected that this unusual sale was made as a means 
of 
laundering the money obtained from Huallaga. 
  A short time thereafter, the business purchased another plot 
of land two blocks farther along. On that plot, the company 
built the "53 Shopping Center," in which 79 shops have been 
offered for lease thus far. The sales manager chosen on this 
occasion was Elias Rojas Boltan. 
<H5>  The Polvos Rosados Trade Fair </H5>
  Terlinda's trip to Iquitos was not the only one she would 
make. She traveled to Arica, Chile, in May of 1993 (Vaticano 
said she left Peru via Tacna-Arica). And in November of that 
year, she made another trip to Medellin, Colombia, where she 
stayed at the Hotel Capitolio. 
  A number of telephone calls were made from her home, located 
in Unit A at 4660 Avenida Arequipa, in Miraflores, to Cali, 
Colombia. The calls were made to the "Holguines" development 
company, to Maria Escobar, to Jairo Frisneda Granada, and to 
Enrique Rocha. 
  The trip to Medellin was nothing unusual, although it is 
known that this was the headquarters of Escobar's cartel, and 
there were sometimes dealings between the two. Proof of this is 
the presence of Juan Chavez Penaherrera, one of the brothers, in 
that city from time to time "on business." 
  Terlinda also managed Booth 151 in Polvos Rosados. Although 
this seems to have happened infrequently, this trade fair also 
served as a meeting place for the members of the organization. 
It is known that Berzabeth, the other sister of Vaticano who was 
arrested, had some booths there. 
  In order to understand the operational plan of the 
commercial 
"facade" completely and to establish further links, a total of 
180 homes and offices throughout Lima, including those of a 
number of offices of aviation companies that make flights into 
the jungle, are being investigated.
