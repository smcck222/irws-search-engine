  [Text] Fedesarrollo [Foundation for Higher Education and 
Development] has sounded the alarm: Drug trafficking money is 
flooding Colombia. Money laundering is at the wholesale level 
here. The measures adopted to control money laundering equally 
affect legitimate businessmen. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] About $4 billion 
from drug trafficking reportedly arrives in the country each 
year. The most common method to introduce money is through 
construction, cars, and many consumption goods like food and 
presents. 
  [Fedesarrollo President Eduardo Lora] Almost every product 
can be imported by purchasing it abroad using foreign currency 
that was bought at very low exchange rates and used as money 
laundering mechanisms. 
  [Reporter] The National Superintendency of Banks and the 
National Customs and Tax Directorate are currently investigating 
some 5,300 violations of foreign exchange guidelines that 
businessmen, importers, and even banks have concocted. At least 
90 percent of them are supposedly involved in money laundering. 
  [Bank Superintendent Jose Elias Melo] Financial institutions 
are frequently involved in money laundering operations because 
they handle money. 
  [Lora] The attraction stems from the slowness of the 
devaluation process, which makes stashing money in Colombia more 
profitable than stashing it abroad. 
  [Reporter] Colombia lacks legislation to control money 
laundering. Meanwhile, measures to restrain lawful money, such 
as credit restrictions, affect drug traffickers and legitimate 
businessmen equally. [end recording]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 22 Mar (EFE) -- Today, Juan 
Maria Rendon, general manager of Colombian Petroleum Enterprise 
(Ecopetrol), said Colombia will not sell crude oil to Cuba 
unless the island pays with letters of credit as is customary in 
international negotiations of this type. The official said 
Ecopetrol "asks everyone who is interested in buying oil to 
guarantee their purchase with a letter of credit. We do that 
with all our customers." That "is what we have asked Cuba to do, 
and it has proposed an alternate payment method that is still 
unsatisfactory. Therefore, as long as they do not offer a letter 
of credit, there will be no deal," Rendon emphasized. 
  Colombian Energy and Mines Minister Guido Nule Amin 
announced 
in early February the sale of approximately 20,000 barrels of 
crude oil per day starting in June or July. According to the 
Colombian minister, the sale would provide one-third of the 
island's crude oil needs. 
  The general manager of Ecopetrol also explained that Cuba 
"is 
offering its main export product, sugar, as its guarantee 
through a three-party transaction with the company that buys 
from them. It offers to pay for the Colombian oil once it has 
sold the sugar." Obviously, Rendon emphasized, "what we want is 
a letter of credit and as of this moment we have not reached an 
agreement." 
  The announcement about the sale of crude oil to Fidel 
Castro's island caused Cuban exiles to protest in front of the 
Colombian consulate in Miami as well as announcing that 
Colombian products would be subject to sabotage and boycott. 
Moreover, the Ecopetrol manager ruled out the possibility that 
Colombia would refine crude oil in Cuba because, he said, the 
refineries on the island are too old.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  Samper Campaigns in Santander Department </H5>
  Campaigning in Santander--among the departments most 
affected 
by guerrilla violence, and where the candidate traveled 
accompanied by a doctor and an ambulance--Liberal Party 
Presidential hopeful Ernesto Samper focused on public order 
problems and social policy. 
  Speaking in San Vicente de Chucuri, Samper said he responded 
to his advisers' suggestion that he not visit this conflictive 
municipality by saying he would "prefer to renounce his 
candidacy" rather than refrain from visiting a particular area. 
Samper said "not one inch of ground" will be relinquished to 
those who perpetrate violence, according to EL TIEMPO. 
  During a campaign stop in Bucaramanga, the capital of 
Santander, Samper discussed his social policy emphasizing that 
"without jobs, there can be no peace." According to EL TIEMPO, 
the candidate's social program will focus on jobs, housing, and 
the problems facing Colombian women. 
  Samper described this policy as the second phase of the 
"apertura" [economic liberalization] program, saying that up to 
now the model has been "incomplete" because "the focus has been 
on economic reform, and people have been forgotten." Samper said: 
  "During the past five years an additional 2.5 million poor 
have appeared in Colombia. For this reason I've said it's now 
time to give `apertura' a heart because there is a direct 
relationship between social conditions and the prevailing 
violence," according to EL TIEMPO. 
  Samper repeated his promise to generate 1.5 million jobs and 
said he would accomplish this by promoting recovery of the 
agricultural sector, stimulating exports, restructuring 
industry, assisting very small business, making housing 
available, and implementing social programs. He also emphasized 
that women would receive more recognition in a future Samper 
administration. He reportedly said that, if he is elected, women 
would be better represented at the decision-making level of 
government, more attention would be given to the needs of poor 
women, and that mechanisms would be introduced to help working 
mothers. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO 19 Feb 94 p 8A; 20 Feb p 
7A) 
<H5>  Samper Visits Choco Department </H5>
  During a 24 February visit to Choco Department Ernesto 
Samper 
called for greater efforts to fight corruption and said he will 
do what is necessary to keep officials from "continuing to rob 
the department," according to a report in EL TIEMPO. He invited 
all members of Congress to join him in promising "to be vigilant 
in the proper management of public funds." Samper promised to 
"protect and promote respect for the rights" of the country's 8 
million blacks. Noting that the department is rich in terms of 
natural resources and biodiversity, Samper said he would like to 
see a center for the study of biodiversity established there. 
(Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO 26 Feb 94 p 3A) 
<H5>  Samper on Whirlwind Tour of 13 Cities </H5>
  In what was reportedly his most intensive campaign tour 
since 
launching his candidacy, Ernesto Samper visited 13 cities 
throughout the country just prior to the 13 March Liberal Party 
primary. 
  In Bogota, Samper addressed businessmen at a forum organized 
by his campaign and offered a three-pronged approach to 
developing the telecommunications sector. His program consists 
in supporting incipient regional enterprises, increasing 
cooperation between public and private sectors, and developing 
human resources. Samper said national and international 
telephone communications systems must be modernized, and 
declared that he favors restructuring the National 
Telecommunications Enterprise (Telecom) and giving it greater 
autonomy. 
  Samper stated that he would promote development of the 
nascent software industry through the creation of free-trade 
zones for technology and by making credit more accessible. 
  During a later address to members of several business 
associations in Cali, the candidate reportedly warned that, if 
the current exchange rate policy continues, in five years the 
only thing the country will be able to export will be petroleum. 
Samper predicted that his administration would be able to 
generate 350,000 jobs in small and medium enterprises and said 
he will make it easier for small business to obtain credit. 
  In addition to Bogota and Cali, Samper visited Medellin, 
Cucuta, Barranquilla, Pereira, Valledupur, and several smaller 
cities. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO 2 Mar 94 6A; 3 Mar p 3A) 
<H5>  Liberal Party Agricultural Commission Makes Recommendations </H5>
  The Liberal Party National Directorate's commission on 
agricultural matters has recommended to Liberal Party President, 
Julio Cesar Turbay, that the party develop a rigorous 
agricultural policy to promote the recovery of this sector. The 
recommendations, contained in a report presented to Turbay, 
reportedly stated that adjustments in macroeconomic policy and 
the "apertura" program must be made. According to the report, 
the exchange rate policy, which was initially aimed at fighting 
inflation, has had a negative impact on the agricultural sector 
by favoring imports over domestic products. The report 
recommended incentives and subsidies for certain producers 
selected on the "basis of efficiency and social equality." It 
further recommended providing facilities to provide cold storage 
during shipping from collection points to domestic and foreign 
ports. The commission report also stated that fixing tariffs on 
agricultural imports is in line with the constitutional mandate 
to provide adequate protection to domestic food production. 
(Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO 7 Mar 94 p 11A) 
<H5>  Pastrana Campaigns in Several Departments </H5>
  Conservative Party Presidential candidate Andres Pastrana 
said during a tour of at least eight municipalities in Cauca 
Department that, if elected, he would spend $2.55 billion on 
highway projects, including construction of 5,000 km of new 
roads, repairs on 9,000 km of existing roads, and maintenance of 
70,000 km of roads throughout the country. Among the projects 
directly benefiting the people of Cauca would be the 
construction of a highway from Popayan to the sea which would 
facilitate export of the department's agricultural produce 
within the framework of the "apertura" program. Pastrana also 
said preliminary studies on the feasilibity of building a 
hydroelectric plant in Micay looked favorable. 
  The candidate also pledged that a future Pastrana 
administration would promote the interests of children, women, 
and the family. He said he would decentralize the Family Welfare 
Institute so that it could obtain the necessary resources. 
Pastrana also said he would promote public housing and expand 
food programs aimed at children in the poorest regions of the 
country. He also promised to promote equal rights for women, 
saying that while the situation has improved, there is still 
"much discrimination." Pastrana was scheduled to visit Valle and 
Huila Departments after completing his tour of Cauca. 
  During later campaign stops in Cesar and La Guajira 
Departments, Pastrana said he is willing to conduct a dialogue 
with the guerrillas when they show a real desire for peace, but 
until then, the Armed Forces and the police must be strengthened 
so they can protect Colombians as the Constitution requires. 
Touching on the controversy surrounding accusations by 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff that Colombian bishops have 
had unauthorized contacts with the country's insurgents, 
Pastrana noted that the bishops are protected by an 
internationally recognized agreement which includes restrictions 
on investigating and prosecuting members of the church hierarchy. 
  Pastrana said he favors constructing irrigation systems to 
restore productivity to 25,000 hectares of land in several La 
Guajira municipalities. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO 24 Feb 94 
p 6A; 25 Feb 8A; 7 Mar 11A) 
<H5>  Pastrana Attends Anticorruption Conference in Ecuador </H5>
  Andres Pastrana traveled to Quito on 2 March to attend a 
meeting of Transparency International, an organization dedicated 
to fighting corruption. In his address, Pastrana reportedly 
asked all Latin American countries and the entire international 
community to take up the fight against corruption "immediately 
and with all possible force." Pastrana reportedly said this was 
the only way to prevent the destruction of the democratic 
system. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL ESPECTADOR 2 Mar 94 p 6A; 3 Mar p

<F P=106> [Interview with Galo Abril, planning secretary for the </F>
National Council on Development, by Teresa Herrera; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] The government expressed its optimism by 
guaranteeing Ecuadorans that 1994 will be "a very good year." 
Because of this the adoption of new economic measures was put 
aside, except for those still pending from 1993, such as an 
increase in the price of gas for domestic use and in telephone 
rates. 
  Nevertheless, other matters remain to be settled that 
involve 
the modernization of the state and privatization of its 
enterprises, the promulgation of new laws and regulations, and 
the announcement on the minimum salary of 66,000 sucres per 
month, that has not been changed since 1993. 
  "If there is not another decrease in the price of petroleum, 
or a landslide, or washouts, or floods, if these things do not 
happen, I would guarantee Ecuadoran society, Ecuador in general, 
that we will have a very good year in 1994," said Galo Abril, 
planning secretary for the National council on Development 
(CONADE). 
  Abril stated today in declarations to HOY that negotiations 
are under way with the IMF for "economic rehabilitation that 
will raise Ecuador's prestige in the eyes of international 
agencies, such as the commercial banks, among others." 
<H5>  The Interview </H5>
  The following is the interview of the planning secretary by 
this newspaper: 
  [Herrera] What are the prospects for this year? 
  [Abril] The fall in the price of crude on the international 
market caused a budget deficit that was bridged by the latest 
increase in gasoline prices, so that the goal of inflation of 
about 20 percent calculated for this year is being attained; we 
believe that economic growth initially forecast at three percent 
will be about 2.5 percent due to a drop in public investment; 
and in the foreign sector we estimate that there will be good 
progress in the balance of payments and therefore maintenance, 
with a slight increase, of international monetary reserves. That 
is to say, the originally planned goals will be reached, 
economic growth will be less than 3 percent, but not 
dramatically so. 
  [Herrera] Will the new prospects affect public investment? 
  [Abril] In the process of compensating for the decline in 
the 
price of petroleum, the government has tried to preserve those 
investments in infrastructure that support production, such as 
highways, local roads, irrigation systems, drainage, and others, 
that are fundamental for farming in particular and for the 
agricultural sector to be able to bring their products to 
market. It will try to improve their production with the purpose 
of encouraging employment in two ways: directly, with employees 
engaged in infrastructural projects, and by greater production 
through support to private activity. 
  These projects have great importance, in their turn, in all 
branches of the construction sector, in material supply 
activities as well as in lumber and metal manufacturing, among 
others. 
  In housing, the 1994 program exceeds 20,000 units, which in 
itself means job creation. Therefore, if spending is used 
rationally to improve the infrastructure--although there may be 
a small reduction in growth--the original goals and social 
responsiveness through job creation, will be achieved in 1994. 
  [Herrera] Why will the monetary reserves not grow? 
  [Abril] Growth of the monetary reserves depends on economic 
growth, but we absolutely do not believe that reserves will be 
less than $1.2 billion at the end of 1994. 
  [Herrera] Given these prospects, will Ecuador reinitiate 
payments to the creditor banks? 
  [Abril] We do not know. It depends on the foreign debt 
negotiations. 
  [Herrera] With the latest adjustments in gasoline prices, 
which seems to have been one of the IMF's demands, the way would 
be open. 
  [Abril] I would like someone to certify for me what the IMF 
demands. I do not know why everyone has that on their mind: the 
IMF demands. We are negotiating economic rehabilitation that 
will raise the country's prestige in the eyes of international 
agencies, among others the banks, but these are things that we 
are planning. 
  [Herrera] As a sovereign country? 
  [Abril] Correct. I have not seen any IMF mission here that 
is 
demanding anything from the government's economic team. These 
are our proposals about the best way to reach economic stability 
in the country, including an agreement with private banks. 
  It is a problem that should not puzzle anyone. The country 
must pay its debts, first, to all of the multilateral lending 
agencies, such as the World Bank, the IDB [Inter-American 
Development Bank], the Andean Development Corporation and 
European governments, which constitute the sources of support, 
in large part, for the nation's investment. 
  In addition, we have a problem dating back years. It is one 
of not negotiating with private banks, and it is blocking an 
important flow of private investment capital and affecting the 
country's development, but nobody is imposing anything. 
  [Herrera] If investment in the country has declined, is the 
British magazine THE ECONOMIST correct when it discusses this 
subject? 
  [Abril] For investment to take place in a country, certain 
elements are required that are generally based on a stable 
economy, and from that point of view this government has managed 
to create a perception of stability that is attractive for 
foreign investment. 
  Another factor is political stability, which means that the 
established rules of the game, whatever they may be, are 
maintained. But if what is happening in Ecuador is the case, 
that once a rule is established it is immediately changed by 
political or economic circumstances, then we lose credibility 
abroad, and this is very harmful to the country, but it is not 
necessarily the fault of the national government. 
  A third element that attracts foreign investment is labor 
productivity, comparative advantage, and the country's 
resources, but if labor in Ecuador has low productivity because 
of poor education, poor training, and low adaptability, then it 
is not attractive for companies in which technology is intensive 
and changes rapidly. 
  [Herrera] Is the lack of trained manpower the major problem? 
  [Abril] It is not desirable to come to a country where 
manpower cannot be trained and retrained when required. It is 
the great national problem and we are working on it very hard: 
the general secretary for planning and the Ministry of Education 
are working constantly to deal with this problem, and there is 
already concrete progress: we have adapted to modern 
circumstances with a new program to train human resources. 
  The situation will not change overnight. These are 
requirements that Ecuador fulfills in part, but sometimes it 
does not, and this is often due to political instability. 
  [Herrera] Although there may be political factors, why is 
there no progress in the process of modernization of the state, 
and why has the new leadership for CONAM [National Modernization 
Council] not been named, following the resignations of its 
president and director? 
  [Abril] The delay in passing the law obviously blocked 
progress in the process of state modernization, particularly the 
public sector and the turning over to the private sector of 
those areas it can manage efficiently. Once the law is 
passed--and it is not what was needed for a dynamic process of 
modernization because it still has important restrictions--we 
will go forward. 
  Everything possible is being done, such as the sale of 
financial assets of the National Financial Corporation, the 
Ecuadoran Bank for Housing. Shares in the Selva Alegre cement 
company are about to be issued. The Ecuadoran Aviation case is 
almost completed. 
  It is true that new leadership for CONAM has not been named 
to manage that institution, but there is a technical working 
group made up of officials from the Finance Ministry, CONADE and 
the Comptroller's Office that is moving ahead, preparing solid 
modernization programs. 
  [Herrera] The sale of shares in the Financial Corporation 
and 
the Ecuadoran Aviation case occurred before passage of the 
modernization law. When will the government definitively start 
the process? 
  [Abril] These matters are under constant study. While the 
law 
was under debate, all situations were studied in which 
privatization or conversion to a concession were feasible. 
  Programs are already in progress in the hydrocarbons sector, 
such as pipeline construction; in the electric energy sector, 
turning over new generating capacity in small power plants to 
private enterprise, as well as aeolian power (electricity 
generated by the wind), among others. 
  The state has not stood still. If one is unable to see a 
transfer to the private sector, it is because the definitive 
legal framework has not been created, but greater dynamism will 
be evident this year. 
  [Herrera] Will the government propose new laws and reforms? 
  [Abril] Certainly. We have several, such as the law on 
electric energy, the law on concessions, on telecommunications, 
on government contracts, reforms of the monetary system law, and 
agrarian reform. 
  There are a great number of changes in the laws that are 
already prepared and they are being discussed with various 
social sectors to seek consensus. 
<H5>  [Box, p 5A] </H5>
<H5>  On Investments and Salaries </H5>
  The central government's investments for 1994 declined to 
110 
billion sucres, following the dramatic fall in the price of 
petroleum on the world market to $10 per barrel. 
  Nevertheless, Galo Abril, planning secretary for CONADE, 
said 
that many of the projects in the investment program would not 
necessarily be halted, because they will be carried out with 
other sources of financing, such as the State Bank. 
  A reduction in investment will be in effect for some of the 
large companies, such as EMETEL [State-Owned Telecommunications 
Company], PETROECUADOR [Ecuadoran State Petroleum Enterprise], 
INECEL [Ecuadoran Institute for Electrification], among other 
autonomous agencies. 
  "The reductions are not such as to change the government's 
goals in the composition of current spending. Public investment 
remains in proportion to national income, about 8 percent of 
gross domestic product (GDP); in 1993 it was 7 percent," said 
Abril, reiterating that this was no reason to expect an economic 
debacle. 
  [Herrera] Will the price of gas increase? 
  [Abril] This is a matter of restructuring budgetary income 
and spending, the general subsidies that benefit everyone, to 
focus subsidies directly on the poor, and with the money saved 
carry out social and public works. We are working on that. 
  [Herrera] Is this the only measure still to be taken? 
  [Abril] Yes, it is within the budget deficit under study. If 
the deficit cannot be covered with an increase in the value 
added tax, another source will have to be found. Therefore, with 
the adjustable duty on the price of gasoline, if the price of 
crude rises on the international market, tax revenues will 
improve and fuel prices will go down. 
  [Herrera] And what do you have to say about salaries? 
  [Abril] Salaries will be reviewed in July, as the law 
provides. 
  [Herrera] Would these be salaries only, or the minimum wage? 
  [Abril] We do not know. At the moment, there will be a 
review. It depends on how different cost components evolve and 
other factors, whether to choose one of the two, or to adjust 
both.

  [Text] After the weekly meeting that Juan Carlos Wasmosy, 
in his role as commander in chief of the Armed Forces, had with 
the top-ranking commanders, Colonel Carlos Medina Monjagata, 
director of the Social Communications Center of the Military 
Forces, on 23 March announced that our country's Armed Forces 
will after all carry out the joint operation called "Strong 
Roads '94 South" ["Fuertes Caminos '94 Sur"] in San Pedro 
Department. The operation will be carried out by units of the 
Engineering Command, and within the same time span that had been 
announced for the operation with U.S. troops. Monjagata could 
not explain where the funds would come from. 
  "The commander in chief on 23 March ordered that this 
operation be carried out on the same date and in the same region 
by units of the Army's Engineering Command jointly with other 
military units," Monjagata said. 
  The officer stated that the operation that was planned by 
the 
Americans will be carried out, "but with units of our Armed 
Forces." In this respect we must recall that the Paraguayan 
Government did not grant permission to the U.S. Armed Forces to 
carry out the operation, and denied entry to 600 soldiers and 
technicians that were going to build eight schools, the same 
number of water tanks, and a health center, and improve the 
roads in San Pedro Department. 
  The government's argument for not letting in the U.S. troops 
was based on the fact that some of the conditions that had been 
requested by the Americans were out of order. 
  When asked, Monjagata could not say where the Armed Forces 
would get the funds and resources to carry out this operation, 
which will be called "Strong Roads '94 South." 
  "Presumably the commander in chief will know where to get 
these funds," Monjagata said, and added that he did not have 
that information. 
  He indicated that in his opinion the funds will be provided 
from the budget of the Armed Forces. 
  It is strange that Wasmosy has ordered that the Armed Forces 
participate in an operation that deals with construction work, 
which should be in the hands of private companies, and it is 
also strange that the origin of the funds to be used has not 
been specified.

  [Excerpts] Arturo Jara Avelli, president of the UIP 
[Paraguayan Industrial Union], reported that during the latest 
UIP executive board meeting the unanimous decision was made "to 
withdraw support for the government, as no results can be seen 
for this sector." 
  The UIP executive board will meet on 30 March to debate this 
issue as well as the country's economic situation and the 
government position in face of demands made by industrialists. 
  The rupture between the industrial sector and the government 
will lead within a short term to the withdrawal of its 
representatives in the Coordination Council for Social 
Development. This decision was conveyed yesterday to Industry 
and Commerce Minister Uvaldo Scavone, who also received the 
concerns of the industrialists. 
  Jara Avelli said: "Some of the problems we see in the 
current situation are an economic policy harmful to industry, 
the overvaluation of local currency that favors `dumping' by 
some countries into the Paraguayan economy, and the lack of 
support for this sector." [passage omitted] 
  According to Jara Avelli, the industrialists gave the 
government eight months time by keeping a "prudent silence, and 
the government should have at least shown the political will to 
solve the problems, but we did not see any such thing," and we 
therefore decided to withdraw our support. 
  He said: "Industry receives support in the electoral 
campaigns, and we saw within the economic program of President 
Juan Carlos Wasmosy an industrial development plan, but nothing 
of that plan has been fulfilled." 
  He added: "We realized the government's lack of a political 
will to change the economy of exploiting raw materials without 
added value, and of trying to solve the problem by importing 
subsidized finished products -- in other words a system that 
creates hunger among peasants and favors a privileged group of 
importers." 
  He concluded by saying: "The government must realize it 
cannot continue to put the industrial sector aside."

<F P=106> [Report by Mario Espinosa] </F>
  [Excerpts] The report and conclusions handed down by the 
Special Antinarcotics Force, FELCN, to the Constitution 
Commission of the Chamber of Deputies contain very serious 
charges. Although the report exempts former President Jaime Paz 
Zamora from any link to drug trafficking, it clearly indicates 
that Paz Zamora's closest assistants -- including Susana Seleme 
and Oscar Eid Franco -- have been linked to drug trafficking or 
have concealed this sort of crime. The report, which the FELCN 
handed to the congressional commission at 2300 last night, also 
contains a series of other names. 
  The report clearly establishes that there is evidence that 
Oscar Eid Franco, current Movement of the Revolutionary Left 
(MIR) president; former Interior Minister Guillermo Capobianco; 
Susana Seleme, former government palace private secretary; 
former Santa Cruz Mayor Rolando Arostegui; Carlos Valverde, 
former Santa Cruz Department intelligence chief; and other less 
important MIR leaders have been linked to drug trafficking. 
[passage omitted] 
  More than 10 MIR leaders are being charged with involvement 
in drug trafficking. The FELCN establishes three groups of 
allegedly guilty people. The first group is charged with links 
to drug trafficking gang responsible for processing, selling, 
and trafficking in cocaine. In the second group are included 
Oscar Eid, Susana Seleme, Carlos Valverde, and other MIR members 
who are charged with alleged dubious scheming and unlawful 
association with Chavarria. It is also said that they concealed 
drug trafficking crimes. The third group includes Guillermo 
Capobianco and Rolando Arostegui, MIR leaders who have had 
special privileges. In this regard the Constitution Commission 
members have stated that although they committed the same crimes 
as the aforementioned people, the crimes will be studied by a 
congressional commission. 
  Jaime Paz Zamora was not mentioned in this report sent to 
the 
Constitution Commission. [passage omitted] 
  The FELCN is also pressing charges against the Colombian 
Guido Arce; Elmer Saucedo, former national chief of the 
department of goods seized from drug traffickers; Army Colonel 
Jorge Velazquez, who was former President Jaime Paz Zamora's 
aide-de-camp and head of the aides-de-camp; and Fernando 
Canelas; in addition to Susana Seleme; Oscar Eid; Carlos 
Valverde; Guillermo Capobianco; and former Mayor Arostegui. All 
of them are MIR leaders or people closely related to the 
previous administration. We repeat that these people have all 
been mentioned in the report handed by the FELCN to the 
Constitution Commission. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Text" of Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle's state </F>
of the nation message to Congress in Montevideo on 15 March] 
  [Text] Mr. President of the national Congress, Gonzalo 
Aguirre Ramirez: 
  In compliance with Article 168, Clause 5, of the 
Constitution, the executive branch appears today before Congress 
to report on government actions since 15 March 1993. Details of 
executive branch activities, ministry by ministry, were 
delivered to the legislators today; that document forms part of 
this message. 
  It is with great satisfaction that I once again confirm the 
full enforcement of the Constitution and the state of law, as 
well as the full enjoyment and exercise of the people's rights. 
  This is the fourth and last time during this administration 
that the executive branch appears before legislators, who are 
the direct representatives of the people's sovereignty. This 
message has a special significance because, although this 
administration has almost one more year in power, our 
institutional rules do not establish a further appearance before 
the legislative branch, apart from that in March of each year. 
We reaffirm here what has been said many times: The government 
administration is a five-year term and although national 
elections are held during the fifth year, we hope it will also 
be a year of important achievements to show, among other things, 
that the health and strength of the democratic system not only 
relies on electoral events, but in the effective exercise of the 
constitutional rights of government in the search for solutions 
to national problems. 
  Honorable legislators: We believe it is necessary to deliver 
on this occasion -- the last established by the Constitution -- 
a balance of the government administration to date so that the 
people will understand what has been done over the year and 
learn about the real operation of the political system which 
they authorized through their votes. 
  Before getting down to details, it is necessary to recall 
the 
conditions under which government actions have been developed 
during this period. Prior to the elections, we who were elected 
to hold government functions through the votes of our fellow 
countrymen prepared a clearly defined line of action, both the 
objectives and the means to implement them. 
  We believe it is very important to recall this point because 
we believe the people need a clear understanding of why 
government action is required to strengthen the democratic 
system. 
  Honorable legislators, we were clear in our government 
proposal and we have tried to be consistent in fulfilling our 
promises. 
  The relationship among the forces that emerged from the 
elections should also be recalled. The results approved by the 
Electoral Court determined that within Congress no single party 
had the majority. This was known beforehand, it came as no 
surprise due to the relatively equal strength of the political 
forces. Being aware of this situation, we emphasized before and 
after the elections the need to reach political agreement to 
allow operational congressional majorities in order to have an 
effective government administration. 
  It is known that our country chose the law as the main 
government instrument. Our registries have about 17,000 laws. 
The most important issues, as well as those of lesser 
importance, have been resolved through the approval of legal 
rules, therefore their reform require decisions of equal 
juridical level. This is why the congressional majority is 
extremely important for us because while the executive branch is 
exclusively responsible for promulgating decrees, this is not as 
significant as in other countries. 
  This situation justifies the attempt to organize a 
political coalition, except in the case of a party that wants to 
obtain an absolute majority in both houses. Large sectors of 
society seek to amend the Constitution in an attempt to 
facilitate or even force political parties to achieve solutions 
by consensus and thus make political action more fluent and 
efficient. 
  The current Constitution does not forbid this, given that an 
agreement among parties or party sectors is enough to approve 
far-reaching laws. This is what we sought at the beginning of 
this administration, but we did not obtain the results we 
expected. Perhaps future governments should ask why -- and the 
answer probably is not in the Constitution -- we need to adopt 
congressional coalitions as a political practice. This is 
envisaged in our Constitution and leads to the formation of 
congressional blocs which in turn create relative participation 
in the cabinet. 
  We thought such coalitions would be even more feasible in 
light of the coincidences over the diagnosis and government 
solutions which the large political parties announced. 
Unfortunately this was not the case. This is the reason behind 
the delay in approving some laws designed to bring about changes 
and the rejection of others. 
  Relations between the executive and legislative branches 
developed within the framework of institutional normalcy and 
mutual respect which, notwithstanding the harshness we use when 
exerting our freedom of opinion, constitute a national 
characteristic. 
  During this congressional term the executive branch has sent 
414 draft bills to Congress. As stated before, not all bills 
were equally important. Their quantity does not thus allow us 
to measure the degree of efficiency of our relations. During 
this speech I will mention the ones I consider most important. 
  Congress has exerted its constitutional wisdom as 
comptroller 
-- as established in Articles 118 and 119 of the Constitution. 
Congress requested many reports and summoned ministers on 17 
occasions. The number of times executive branch officials were 
called to participate in congressional committee sessions 
increased considerably, almost to weekly summons, which prompted 
an intense relationship between the two branches and allowed 
congressmen to become fully acquainted with the opinion of the 
executive branch in many fields. 
  The executive branch exerted its right to veto 11 times, 
thus 
using the last resort of its institutional relationship with 
Congress. Of the 11 vetoes, six were withdrawn to solve 
differences of criteria on the matters involved. 
  We must point out the occasions on which the executive and 
legislative branches agreed on a subject allowed the approval of 
important and probably beneficial and necessary laws to attain 
national objectives. Among these we can mention the approval of 
the Treaty of Asuncion [creating the Common Market of the South, 
Mercosur]; the reform of the port system; the much needed fiscal 
adjustment; the public employees law; the creation of investment 
banks; the relative deregulation of the insurance market; the 
public enterprises law, which was later partially annulled 
through a plebiscite; the new financial intermediation law; and 
the creation of the Ministry of Housing, Territorial Order, and 
Environment, among others. 
  Since the beginning, the executive branch has established 
economic and social objectives whose partial or total 
accomplishment must be explained during this speech. 
  I will now expand on our goals and achievements in the 
economic field. 
  The executive branch set for itself the goal of creating -- 
as much as a government can -- a framework of conditions 
permitting and favoring stability and sustained growth within 
the economy. 
  For this it was necessary to face great difficulties, some 
of 
them long entrenched. 
  We had to face economic stagnation, low investment levels, 
and a protracted high inflation rate that threatened to run out 
of control. Our economy was still very closed and bore the 
burden of a large foreign debt and a costly and inefficient 
state apparatus, the financing of which had generated a strong 
fiscal deficit and negatively affected the public financial 
system. 
  It was necessary to attack many problems simultaneously and 
in some cases urgently. 
  This administration decided to face our fiscal deficit 
problem with determination. We are convinced that balanced 
public accounts are indispensable for economic stability and 
essential for achieving sustained growth. 
  When we assumed power on 1 March 1990, our public accounts 
showed a deficit of 8.7 percent of the GDP. This represented a 
6.7 percent deficit existing in December 1989 plus an additional 
2 percent that resulted from the constitutional reform on 
pensions adjustment. 
  With the help of the fiscal adjustment law, mentioned above, 
the government reduced that deficit to 1 percent of the GDP. 
Here we must note the rigidity of some budget items. The 
contribution of the General Revenue to the social security 
system clearly stands out. This assistance totalled $19.4 
million in 1990, $96.8 million in 1991, $171.2 million in 1992, 
and $282 million in 1993. 
  Just to mention these figures shows the unpostponable need 
to 
radically modify the national social security system, not only 
to strengthen it, but also to see that the burden is not so 
heavy on workers, the national productive apparatus, and the 
Treasury. If this were the case we could liberate resources to 
invest in other programs which would undoubtedly benefit the 
entire community. 
  The balance of public accounts, as well as the 
implementation 
of reliable and appropriate monetary and foreign exchange 
policies have contributed to a gradual drop in inflation, which 
is a scourge that affects our entire society but which hurts 
particularly those without fixed incomes. 
  At the start of this administration inflation was moving 
upward, with a hyperinflation trend. Following the 
implementation of some difficult measures inflation began to 
slow down and then to drop. Today, and without feeling 
self-satisfied, we can point out that inflation has dropped 
below an annual rate of 50 percent. In 1990 it was 129 percent. 
  Our economic stabilization was accompanied by a deepening of 
the economic opening that had been implemented during previous 
years, seeking a more efficient allocation of resources. This 
consisted of simultaneously implementing a double opening 
process: regional integration within the Mercosur process and 
unilateral global opening through a gradual reduction of tariffs 
and custom barriers. It is important to note that these measures 
were announced ahead of time so as to create confidence among 
economic agents at the time of making decisions. 
  This economic opening, together with the stabilization 
process, has favored investments and growth, a process of 
productive reconversion, and a general modernization of the 
country. One indication of these factors is that productivity 
has increased. 
  The importation of capital goods, which was encouraged by 
the 
government through tariff and tax reductions, doubled between 
1989 and 1993 -- rising from $156 million in 1989 to nearly $350 
million in 1993. Our entire transport system has been 
renovated, including buses, trucks, and automobiles. The 
importation of machinery and equipment rose from $138 million in 
1989 to nearly $300 million in 1993. 
  This modernization process also affected other areas. The 
use of computers and telecommunications equipment increased. 
Even in our homes there was a process of renewal and equipping 
with durable goods that is unprecedented in our recent history. 
The importation of durable consumer goods went from $78 million 
in 1989 to over $250 million in 1993. 
  The balance of trade, which was negative due to this import 
boom, and the negative effects of the low prices of some of our 
national primary export did not hide a continuous increase in 
nontraditional exports, which together grew by 20.5 [not further 
specified] between 1989 and 1993, despite a modest increase in 
1993. 
  The balance of payment is favorable and our external front, 
which is in line with the other macroeconomic variables, 
registers very positive indexes. We are talking about a 
positive balance in our balance of payments as a result of the 
entry of capital and tourism, which -- duly stimulated -- 
continues to grow. 
  We must also refer to what our country owes and what it 
used to owe. Our net public debt during this past term dropped 
considerably. It must be recalled that in 1989 it represented 
28.2 percent of the GDP. By the end of 1993 it had dropped to 
13.9 percent as result of refinancing, the increase in our 
international reserves, and the drop in demand for funds by 
public organs thanks to their streamlining. Net international 
banking system reserves -- including the Central Bank, the Bank 
of the Republic, and private banks -- amount to $2.962 billion. 
This is well up on the $1.768 billion registered at the end of 
1989. The net foreign reserves at the Central Bank are now 
balanced, compared with a $915 million deficit found in February 
1990. 
  Financial streamlining, stabilization, economic opening, 
investment promotion, and all the objectives to encourage 
economic growth -- which are indispensable for our society and 
transformation -- require the transformation of the state. 
  Under the heading of state reform, this administration 
promised to substantially modify that ancient institution. This 
field can be subdivided: it can either be changed either through 
a law or through an executive branch decree. The choice 
determines a different degree of importance within national life. 
  In the field of state participation, since the beginning of 
the century state industrial and commercial activities have been 
organized under their own clear, unique, profile, because that 
is how those who governed the country understood things. It is 
wrong to now criticize solutions which past governors applied as 
necessary and beneficial for the common good. It must 
nonetheless be said that despite the solutions implemented in 
the past, most political forces recognize this situation is a 
problem that must be solved. 
  Soon after the beginning of my mandate, this administration 
sent a draft bill to Congress attempting to coordinate 
practically all public activities by proposing a deep 
transformation. It was fully analyzed by Congress, which even 
sought outside opinions and counseling on different aspects. 
The first result of the work of Congress was the separation of 
one of the aspects the law wanted to reform: port activities. 
Congress turned it into a completely different entity. 
  The central theme was approved by Congress and became part 
of 
the Public Enterprises Law. The draft bill established in one 
of its chapters gives general norms for all public enterprises, 
introducing the gradual changes in them. Another chapter refers 
to other specific subjects like the public telecommunications 
company, the airline, and the fishing enterprise. The public 
debate before and after the approval of the law resulted in a 
plebiscite as a definite solution to the problem. This 
initiative, by will of the people was centered on partial 
aspects of the law which were abrogated by the end of 1992 by 
decision of the people. Where validity was maintained, given 
that the subjects were not included in the plebiscite, the 
executive branch proceeded to liquidate the ILPE [State Seal and 
Fishing Industry] and to implement a mechanism to draw private 
capital into PLUNA [Uruguayan National Airlines]. 
  The executive branch suggested that the funds raised from 
the 
implementation of the mentioned law should be invested in 
health, education, housing, or the capitalization of the Social 
Security Bank. This was done and the funds raised from the 
liquidation of ILPE -- which were small in face of the needs of 
the country -- were invested in education, implementing a real 
transformation in state patrimony. National assets were 
reassigned to more productive social objectives. 
  The Port System Reform Law passed by Congress and which was 
not subjected to the plebiscite, is currently fully enforced and 
the results of its application are evidently satisfactory. It 
must be pointed out that an important activity like the 
exploitation of our ports, has rendered the following results: 
  -- Productivity in cargo handling increased according -- 
based on the time the cargo spends on the dock -- by 300 percent 
for cargo, 200 percent for bulk cargo, and 88 percent for 
containers; 
  -- The average time a ship remains in the port of Montevideo 
has dropped from 12 hours in the roadstead to 0 hours [as 
published], and the time they remain in port has dropped from 78 
hours to 34 hours; 
  -- The volume of cargo moved in the Port of Montevideo in 
relation to the number of ANP [National Ports Administration] 
workers rose from 360 metric tons "per head" in 1990 to 1,100 
metric tons in 1993; 
  -- Port tariffs dropped 26 percent on imports, 33 percent on 
transshipment and traffic, and 10 percent on exports; 
  -- The number of ANP employees dropped from 4,400 to 2,400; 
  -- The total cost of stopping in Montevideo is 50 percent 
less for shipowners than any other nearby port; 
  -- The time ships remained docked has dropped by 40 percent; 
  -- The traffic of ships continues to increase by 2.5 percent 
per year: the number of containers has increased by 12 percent. 
  These details reveal the benefits of a reform like this for 
the entire community. Its prospects are even more promising if 
one considers there are more than 40 authorized trading 
enterprises [empresas de prestacion de servicios de mercaderia] 
in Montevideo and ports in the interior, most of which entail 
national capital. We have thus achieved the diversification of 
the market and encouraged national enterprises to participate. 
  The reduction of port employees through incentives and the 
natural reduction process was carried out without hardship to 
the workers involved. 
  Another significant chapter in this state reform was the 
approval of the law that eliminated insurance company 
monopolies. This law broadens the consumers' alternatives for a 
service as important as insurance. It will be fully in force by 
next May, according to Decree No. 530/93 
  The post of insurance superintendent will be created soon. 
It will handle this important activity of modern times. 
  But the impact of state activities on daily developments 
does 
not end with the great productive fields. Many times this 
impact is also felt in regulations and bureaucratic procedures 
that hinder and obstruct the activities of private individuals 
or enterprises. To free citizens of useless regulations and 
rules, the executive branch is creating the Plan to Deregulate 
Foreign Trade and Investments [Plan de Desregulacion del 
Comercio Exterior y las Inversiones] (Plades) and the Pronade 
[National Debureaucratization Program]. 
  Without going into details, it should be pointed out that by 
eliminating superfluous red tape, useless forms, unnecessary 
signatures, and purposeless sworn statements, Plades and Pronade 
-- whose implementation has demanded a minimum investment -- 
will save thousands of dollars, without mentioning the saving in 
time and energy. We also mention the great changes in the state 
purchasing system as well as the changes in administrative 
procedures through Decree No. 500, which was approved in 
December 1991. 
  There is still a lot to be done but there are many 
successful 
examples. A more efficient and cheaper port is a good example. 
An efficient ground service at Carrasco airport is another good 
example. We can also mention the importance of the elimination 
of inefficient activities such El Espinillar, ILPE, the National 
Printing Shop, and the personnel cuts in all public enterprises. 
  The results can be calculated in many ways. Everyone is 
aware of the impact of tariffs on our economy. It should be 
pointed out that between 1989 and 1993 the price of diesel fuel 
has dropped in real terms by 44.3 percent, fuel oil by 36 
percent, and electricity by 17.2 percent. In the case of phone 
tariffs, the real reduction averages 40 percent. 
  There is still a lot to be done in the state reform field 
and 
all political parties are aware of this. 
  Messrs. legislators: The results of the measures taken in 
the 
economic field are numerous, yet they represent a single result. 
In last year's message I pointed out that the government did 
not have enough power to drive society towards certain purposes; 
but it did and does have the power to create the necessary 
conditions for economic agents to grow. 
  We should all feel proud, without running the risk of being 
complacent, that the country has confronted the great 
difficulties and the deep-rooted changes a greater commercial 
opening demands, not only dodging the threat of economic 
recession like that currently affecting many countries, but 
resuming the path of growth. 
  Our output grew by almost 1 percent in 1990; by 2.9 percent 
in 1991; and by 7.4 percent in 1992. We estimate the percentage 
duly adjusted for last year amounts to 2.5 percent. 
  The same goes for investments: They grew by 22.3 percent in 
1991; by 9.9 percent in 1992, and by about 20 percent in 1993. 
This tendency, according to the behavior of some indicators, 
continues. 
  Unemployment indicators also show a positive tendency with 
historically low levels. Real salaries and family incomes have 
also increased. 
  Salaries in the private sector grew, in real terms, by 3.3 
percent last year, while public salaries grew almost by 8 
percent. The real family income grew in Montevideo: If it stood 
at 100 points in 1989 it reached 115.2 points in 1993.

  [Text] National Convergence [CN] supports Democratic 
Action's [AD] empowering bill proposal which gives special 
powers to the executive to sign into law a tax package presented 
at Congress. CN coordinator Jose Miguel Uzcategui said the party 
has already told the president their position. He also said, 
however, that CN legislation experts have studied the empowering 
bill proposed by AD and have found that financial and economic 
outlines, which should have been included in the proposal, are 
missing. He also said that analysts have been looking into past 
experiences with previous empowering laws, particularly those 
during former President Ramon J. Velasquez' time when he was 
forced to apply measures, like the value-added tax, on consumers. 
  [Begin Uzcategui recording] Additionally, we must discuss 
the 
temporary nature of the law. Three of the previous experiences 
lasted one year each and the last one lasted five months. We 
believe some decrees can be drafted and enacted in 30 days. This 
period of time, however, is too short for fiscal measures. [end 
recording] 
  Finally, Uzcategui said it is the president which must 
decide 
on an empowering bill, providing the president is familiar with 
the bill's definitive wording.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe by Francisco </F>
Fortuno in Mexico City on 24 March; from the "24 Hours" newscast 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Fortuno] Dr. Pedro Aspe, thank you very much for 
these few minutes. Sir, what can we expect in Mexican economic 
matters following the events of the last few hours? 
  [Aspe] Well, as we all know, following these unfortunate 
incidents, in which our friend Luis Donaldo Colosio was killed, 
the financial sector today joined the call made by the president 
of the Republic and did not operate today because of the 
national mourning. International markets, where transactions are 
constantly taking place, such as public debt transactions and 
the issuance of stocks at the New York Stock Exchange, were 
somewhat nervous at the beginning. There was a certain decrease 
in the amount of transactions. Throughout the day we saw a 
return to stability, and it was a pleasant surprise. This means 
that markets are much more mature. Banks and the Mexican Stock 
Exchange and so on will return to normal operations tomorrow. 
They will open their operations as any other day. The 
important thing to note is the enormous stability that is being 
observed despite the tragic events. We have bigger, more 
stable, and more mature markets. 
  [Fortuno] Sir, the reaction by the United States, especially 
by President Bill Clinton and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentzen, 
was to give complete support to Mexico. Could you explain this 
support? 
  [Aspe] Certainly. As you have seen, today the president of 
the United States, after talking to the president of Mexico, 
issued a series of very favorable statements for Mexican 
institutions. 
  As you know, Secretary Bentsen issued two statements. The 
first one conveyed his strong support for the implementation of 
President Salinas' economic policy. His second statement was an 
unexpected one. We have a mutual support agreement between the 
U.S. Treasury and the Mexican Finance Secretariat, and one 
between the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank and the Mexican Central 
Bank. For many years these mutual support agreements had been 
maintained in the range of $1 billion. In an unexpected action 
and following many talks and negotiations that we were finally 
able to speed up today, we agreed on increasing this credit line 
from $1 to $6 billion. In other words, there was a one-time 
600-percent increase. 
  Why is this important? What is truly important is that we 
have a good economic policy -- one without deficits -- a prudent 
monetary policy, and an autonomous Central Bank that will begin 
operating next 1 April. But in addition to this, it is 
important that we have sufficient international reserves, which 
fortunately we do. What we have today has been built up for 
many years. It is the result of the efforts of farmers and 
businessmen, as well as the government. We have large reserves. 
However, this mutual support agreement means that in addition 
to that level of reserves, we have an additional $6 billion to 
make the markets operate in an orderly manner by avoiding any 
volatile movements and to support the stabilization of the 
exchange markets, and needless to say, the economy as a whole. 
  I had the chance to talk with Secretary Bentsen yesterday 
and 
today, and this decision is truly flattering because it entails 
great trust and the idea that we are commercial partners with 
long-term plans. Also, in short-term troublesome times, it is 
mechanisms such as these that help us move closer to stability. 
However, we should not forget that true stability is achieved 
at home. We have been working on this stability, and this is 
why we will not have a fiscal deficit in 1994 because President 
Salinas is committed to turning over an economy with very low 
inflation, comparable to the international inflation level, an 
economy that is growing and recovering, and one that has 
reserves, order, vision, and direction. 
  [Fortuno] This is very clear, Mr. Secretary. Many thanks. 
We are very grateful. 
  [Aspe] Thank you. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Miguel Barcenas; from the "Upon Awakening" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe attended the ceremony 
held at Los Pinos official residence where the pact [for 
stability, competitiveness, and employment] was signed. We 
asked him how things are in the economic sector after Luis 
Donaldo Colosio's assassination. Aspe said clearly Mexico has 
the necessary economic stability to face the situation, and he 
announced economic and stock market activities will be resumed 
in our country today. He then explained clearly and in detail 
the $6-billion line of credit the U.S. Government has extended 
to Mexico. 
  [Begin recording] [Barcenas] Finance Secretary Aspe, what 
can 
we expect in Mexico's economic sector following the latest 
events? 
  [Aspe] As everyone knows, following the deplorable events 
which occurred yesterday and which resulted in the death of our 
friend, Luis Donaldo Colosio, today the financial sector 
endorsed the appeal issued by the president of the republic 
concerning a day of mourning, and it abstained from working. A 
certain nervousness prevailed earlier today, however, in 
international markets where constant operations are carried out, 
for example, public debt operations, the issuance of shares 
registered at the New York Stock Exchange and other types of 
documents, and this resulted in a downward trend. 
  We noticed a return to stability during the day, however, 
and 
this was a pleasant surprise, meaning the markets are much more 
serious and--why not say it--more mature. Banks, stock market 
firms, the Mexican stock market, foreign exchange houses, etc. 
will return to normalcy; they will open for business as any 
other day. The important thing to note about this is the 
enormous stability we noticed despite these tragic events. We 
truly have bigger, more serious, more stable, and more mature 
markets. 
  [Barcenas] The U.S. reaction, meaning President Bill Clinton 
and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, has been to support Mexico 
fully; could you explain what this support entails? 
  [Aspe] Yes, of course. You must have heard today the U.S. 
President issued a series of favorable statements concerning 
Mexican institutions after talking with the president of the 
republic. You know Secretary Bentsen issued two statements: 
One was a statement of support, enormous support, for the way 
President Salinas has handled economic policy; second, an 
unusual thing. We have a reciprocal support agreement between 
the two treasuries, meaning, the U.S. Treasury and the Mexican 
Finance Secretariat, as well as an agreement between the U.S. 
Federal Reserve Bank and our Central Bank of Mexico. 
  These reciprocal support agreements had involved $1 billion 
for many years. In an unusual act and following many talks and 
negotiations that we were able to expedite today, we received an 
increase in the line of reciprocal support, from $1 billion to 
$6 billion, a 600-percent sudden increase. Why is this 
important? It is important to have a good economic policy, not 
to have a deficit, to have a cautious monetary policy, and to 
have an autonomous central bank, which will begin operations in 
April; in addition, we must have ample international reserves, 
which we fortunately have. 
  This has been achieved throughout the years thanks to the 
efforts exerted by workers, peasants, businessmen, and--why not 
say it--the government. We have ample reserves, but the 
reciprocal support agreement means, in addition to the reserve 
levels, we have $600 billion so markets may operate in an 
orderly manner, to prevent any erratic movement, and to support 
the stabilization of foreign exchange markets and, of course, 
the economy as a whole. 
  I had the opportunity to talk with Secretary Bentsen 
yesterday and today, and it is truly something that pleases us, 
because it represents great trust, the idea that we are truly 
trade partners, that we are partners with long-term visions and 
mechanisms. This give us what is necessary to maintain 
stability at a time when we may face short-term turbulences. 
  We must not forget real stability is achieved at home, and 
this stability has been built progressively; hence, we will have 
no fiscal deficit this year. We will not have it because this 
is a pledge assumed by the president of the republic: To 
deliver an economy with a very low inflation, comparable with 
international inflation; a growing economy, which is being 
recovered; an economy with reserves; an economy with order, 
vision, and guidelines. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Statements by the signatories of the Stability, </F>
Competitiveness, and Employment Pact, PECE, including Mexican 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari; Labor Secretary Arsenio 
Farell; Fidel Valasquez, president of the Confederation of 
Mexican Workers; and Hugo Andres Araujo, secretary general of 
the National Peasant Confederation, following a meeting at Los 
Pinos Presidential Palace in Mexico City on 24 March -- live or 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Farrell] Mr. President: In view of the deplorable 
violence that took place yesterday in Tijuana, Baja California 
State and which led to the unfortunate death of Luis Donaldo 
Colosio Murrieta, presidential candidate for the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party [PRI], the signatories of the Stability, 
Competitiveness, and Employment Pact [PECE], in keeping with the 
sincere dismay of the Mexican people and in view of the need to 
redouble the efforts of all sectors to overcome this unhappy 
moment the nation is experiencing, have decided to reinforce the 
agreements currently in effect. 
  Whereas: 
  1. All Mexicans, above any legitimate aspiration and 
objective of each sector, give priority to social peace and are 
unwilling to allow it to be altered. We have much to do for the 
Mexico we want for ourselves and for our children within the 
pluralism and mutual respect that has always prevailed in this 
forum for concerted effort. The signatories of the PECE will 
forcefully defend the results we have achieved as peasants, 
workers, businessmen, and government representatives. With the 
strength of unity, we are going to redouble our efforts to 
achieve the goals we have set for ourselves. 
  2. The unity within the framework of the law in a climate of 
harmony and full respect for the freedoms established by our 
country's political Constitution is a fundamental and 
indispensable element for moving toward the consolidation of our 
economy, the strengthening of our national sovereignty, and the 
improvement of the quality of life of all Mexicans. 
  3. One of the most important achievements of these 
agreements is the Mexican people's increased confidence in the 
future of the nation's economy. Thanks to this increased level 
of confidence, the difficulties that inevitably arise from time 
to time and that could affect our economic activity have been 
overcome without any major disruption of the country's economy. 
Yesterday's tragic events, therefore, did not trigger any 
crises in Mexican financial instruments today. On the contrary, 
the exchange rate at banks and currency exchanges abroad, as 
well as at unregulated currency exchange agencies operating in 
the country, showed considerable stability throughout the day. 
Such was the case for stocks, bonds, and other instruments 
issued by Mexican agencies and offered on many markets abroad, 
especially in New York. 
  4. Mexico's economic policies over the last few years, of 
which this pact is an essential element, have warranted not only 
the confidence of the domestic public and praise from 
international financial market players, but they have also 
elicited support from international organizations and the 
authorities of friendly nations. One outstanding example of this 
is that the U.S. Government has stated today that it is willing 
to allow U.S. financial authorities to assist our country's 
economic leaders in controlling currency exchange markets. To 
this end, they have offered a substantial increase in reciprocal 
lines of credit from $1 billion to $6 billion. The U.S. 
Government has kept these lines in effect for many years to 
promote the good performance of currency markets in each country. 
  5. The consolidation of the means of production, economic 
stability, and the promotion of competitiveness and job creation 
continue to be the main purpose of the sectors that signed this 
agreement. In light of this, the labor, peasant and business 
organizations -- which represent the overwhelming majority of 
the country's productive force -- and the Federal Government 
have agreed: 
  1. To uphold all commitments signed on 3 October 1993 as 
ratified on 12 January 1994 and ensure full compliance with each 
and every agreement therein. 
  2. To express our strongest condemnation of violence and 
attempts to destabilize the institutions we have managed to 
build over several generations, thanks to the efforts of all 
Mexicans. 
  This agreement is signed at Los Pinos Presidential Residence 
on 24 March 1994 in the presence of the president of the United 
States of Mexico. Thank you. 
  [Valasquez] The labor movement, which the Labor Congress 
represents, has approved without further discussion the 
statements made by Arsenio Farell, labor and social welfare 
secretary. We [words indistinct] needed to ratify this pact 
because it guarantees us social peace among productive sectors. 
We also agree with the [word indistinct] condemnation made by 
the [word indistinct] assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio 
Murrieta, our presidential candidate and the presidential 
candidate of the PRI. 
  At times like these, it is impossible to say much, but we 
must condemn this crime and ask the government to work from now 
on against those who use violence as a method to solve their 
problems with other sectors. In cases like this, the labor 
movement wants no more tolerance for these criminals. They must 
be treated as they deserve to be treated: harshly. We must 
condemn their actions, and they must be punished as the law 
stipulates. Thank you. 
  [Luis German Carcova Garcia, president of the Business 
Coordinating Council] Mr. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, 
Mr. Fidel Valasquez Sanchez, Labor Congress president [as 
heard]; Deputy Hugo Andres Araujo, secretary general of the 
National Peasant Confederation; Messrs. Secretaries of State; 
Ladies and Gentlemen: The national business sector is deeply 
concerned and firmly condemns the tragic event of 23 March, 
which ended the life of a brilliant Mexican who was committed to 
his country. This event also symbolizes an attack against 
Mexico and its institutions. Violence, in all its forms, is 
always objectionable and will never be the path to solve 
problems and to meet the legitimate demands of the Mexican 
people. The breach of peace and social order, which are 
necessary conditions for guaranteeing the welfare of our people, 
is unacceptable under any circumstances. 
  Throughout the last few years, Mexicans have proven that 
through dialogue and consensus, we can overcome problems and 
difficult situations by reconciling different opinions and by 
always seeking the welfare of the nation as a whole. We have 
added and multiplied [as heard]. We cannot let events such as 
this, which has submerged Mexico in mourning, divide and 
diminish us. We Mexicans are committed to a plan that, with the 
strong leadership of President Salinas, has helped us overcome 
the deep macroeconomic imbalances that darkened our future. By 
overcoming them, we have been placed at the threshold of healthy 
and sustainable growth that will reverberate in a higher 
standard of living for all our compatriots. 
  We must not change the original plan. Our goal is very 
close. The latest events seem to indicate that there are forces 
interested in steering away from the course and making us turn 
back. This goes against all Mexicans. We will not be defeated. 
We Mexicans, united within the framework of consensus, will 
always be able to find answers peacefully and objectively, as we 
have in the last few years. The path we have traveled is 
already longer that the one we have yet to climb. We reiterate 
that together we will be able to move on. 
  We Mexican businessmen reiterate our commitment to the 
country, our belief that we chose the right path, and our 
commitment to work harmoniously with all sectors of society. We 
express our full support for the government and institutions 
headed by President Salinas. We emphatically reject the path of 
violence, the breach of peace, and lawlessness. We demand 
justice and strict law enforcement. Society demands it. The 
future of Mexico and of our children lies in the institutions, 
laws, unity, and intense and productive efforts of all Mexicans. 
Each of us, especially we businessmen, must be clear about what 
we are doing for Mexico. We must assume our responsibilities 
tactfully. Let us behave with perseverance and affection for 
our country. Let us defend those accomplishments that cost us 
so much work with the law on our side and with unity, 
equanimity, determination, energy, and intelligence. Thank you. 
  [Araujo] Mr. President: The country is going through a 
difficult time. The unfortunate incidents that occurred 
yesterday in Tijuana, where our friend and companion Luis 
Donaldo Colosio Murrieta was slain, attempt to sow discord and 
disunity among Mexicans. Our response must serve to strengthen 
the institutions of the country, to unite the productive 
sectors, as has been manifested here, and to reject provocation 
and violence. To ratify the pact is also a manifestation of 
agreement among producers, workers, businessmen, and the 
government. It clearly establishes before the country that the 
key sectors of our economy are disposed to persevering in our 
work to build a strong, growing economy, more equitably 
distributed and capable of facing the international market. 
  The diverse interests that are permanently expressed in this 
body are part of the intense reality that exists in our country. 
Through a concerted effort, we have shown that it is possible 
to harmonize different viewpoints so long as the general 
interest prevails over private interests. We see that calm and 
reason prevail in the face of difficulties. Let us maintain 
this trend. Let us strengthen calm and reason to prevent 
situations that hurt everyone but which have more of an impact 
on those with lower incomes because of their diminished capacity 
to fight in the face of crisis and instability. 
  As producers of the countryside -- cattlemen, rural property 
owners, farm owners -- let us assume fully the continuation of 
the pact, Mr. President. Our expectation is to build a more 
productive, profitable sector in keeping with national 
priorities. We flatly reject violence and its consequences of 
instability. We are not disposed to leaving to the forces of 
instability the future of our economy and, within it, of the 
Mexican countryside. In this overall concerted effort formula, 
the diverse sectors that come together in the course of our 
activities in the Mexican countryside reiterate our commitment 
to continue the necessary efforts to strengthen our relations 
and our productive association and to defend the rural sector in 
a climate of tolerance and mutual respect. 
  Mr. President, you have the total support of the country's 
agricultural and livestock sector, as well as of the rest of the 
members of this vast table of concerted action, without 
distinction. Today we understand that strengthening the 
instruments of economic concerted effort is indispensable, as is 
closing ranks around you. Your policy of national modernization, 
your proposal of democratic advancement, and your commitment to 
the poor people of Mexico demonstrates this. Let no one be 
deceived. We maintain a great capability to move forward as a 
nation within a framework of differences but with unity on 
fundamental aspects. Thank you very much. 
  [Salinas] Ladies and gentlemen: In view of the unacceptable 
violent act that led to the sad and outrageous death of Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, the representatives of laborers, peasants, 
businessmen, and the government are here today to ratify the 
main terms of the pact. 
  This reflects our full commitment to implement its terms on 
time and shows serenity, a vision of the future, and unity of 
the nation. This unity is based on giving priority to those 
things we value most: sovereignty, liberty, democracy, and 
justice in an atmosphere of legality and harmony. 
  When developments that are incompatible with our values and 
goals occur in the nation's life, Mexicans unite, strengthen the 
ties that bring us closer, and reject with a single voice any 
attempt to make us lose direction and divert our efforts and any 
idea that violence can discourage Mexico. Unity is the most 
powerful of our virtues, and legality represents the full 
validity of our Constitution, our single guiding principle for 
social life. 
  Today, you are ratifying the 3 October commitments to reduce 
inflation, to improve productivity and salaries, and to clearly 
speak out against violence in favor of law and national unity. 
The dedicated work of Mexicans is recognized abroad today. 
This work has allowed us to face the unexpected circumstances 
of life at home and abroad. This recognition is reflected in 
the support mentioned today in the financial area. 
  Also, and this is important, today Mexico joined one of the 
world's most important economic organizations, the OECD. 
Through it, our country will have a much greater presence in 
industrialized countries, especially in Europe. [applause] 
[five-second break in reception] that we will defend the efforts 
made and the opportunities created [three-second break in 
reception] legality that we will not allow impunity to take away 
our serenity. We must continue to advance. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, we will enforce the country's 
Constitution and law because that is the civil thing to do. We 
will comply with peace agreements, because peace and harmony are 
our strongest convictions. We will honor the pact because it is 
an instrument of our solidarity to progress with more justice. 
  We will remain true to ourselves despite the painful 
circumstances, because that is what is demanded by the justified 
indignation of Mexicans in the face of insults. Unity, 
consensus, and unrestricted respect for the law have helped us 
advance and achieve all our goals. Unity will continue to 
guarantee us a better future. That is why we must maintain and 
reaffirm our pride as Mexicans. Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [News conference by Diego Valades Rios, attorney general of </F>
the Federal District, with unidentified reporters at the 
Attorney General's Offices in Tijuana on 24 March; from "ACIR 
Radio News" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Valades] The Federal District Attorney General's 
Office announces that according to the investigation conducted 
so far, the multiple testimonies provided by eyewitnesses, and 
the evidence obtained, it has been confirmed that Mario Aburto 
Martinez was the person who killed Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta 
yesterday. 
  Mario Aburto Martinez fired two shots, one directly at the 
head and the other at the abdomen. The first shot was fatal. 
Both bullets exited the body. The shots were fired with a 
special Brazilian-made .38-caliber Taurus revolver. According 
to the expert's report, the weapon contained two unspent bullets 
and two spent caps. 
  Mario Aburto Martinez was arrested at the scene of the 
incident and brought to Attorney General's Office [PGR] 
installations in Tijuana to make his first statements. He 
admitted being the perpetrator of this crime, which has shaken 
the Mexican republic. His statements were made before the 
Federal District Attorney General's Office in the presence of 
Lawyer Xavier Carbajal, president of the Emilio Orra Baja Bar 
Association of Tijuana, and before Jose Luis Perez Canchola, 
human rights ombudsman of Baja California State, in compliance 
with the provisions of the Republic's Federal Constitution, 
thereby preserving the rights of the person responsible for this 
heinous crime. 
  Aburto Martinez's health condition was also certified upon 
entering the judicial installations because he had already been 
beaten by people near him after he carried out the attack. This 
may be confirmed by the various media that witnessed the 
incident. The attack was carried out following a political 
event at the Lomas Taurinas Neighborhood in this border city. 
  Also turned over to the Attorney General's Office were 
Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela and Jorge Antonio Sanchez Ortega, who 
may be released with legal conditions unless new elements arise 
that change their legal status. 
  The assassin will be remanded in the next few hours and 
taken 
to a maximum-security location. I came to this city on the 
express orders of President Carlos Salinas and I have directly 
coordinated the investigation. I was accompanied by Rene 
Gonzalez de la Vega and Alfonso Cabrera Morales, assistant 
prosecutors for preliminary investigations, and by other 
officials and experts dedicated to the investigation and the 
complete clarification of this regrettable crime. 
  Also working on the investigations was (Mario Fabio 
Beltrones), governor of Sonora State, where Colosio was born. 
  The incidents occurred as follows: At the conclusion of the 
public rally that was part of his election campaign, Luis 
Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, candidate for the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party [PRI], at 1710 stepped off the stage that 
had been constructed for the event in Lomas Taurinas and mingled 
with the people in attendance. He subsequently headed for his 
vehicle. After Colosio walked approximately 10 meters, Mario 
Aburto Martinez emerged from the crowd on Colosio's right-hand 
side. Martinez drew a revolver, placed it a few centimeters 
from Colosio's right temple, and pulled the trigger, causing the 
injury that took his life. After the bullet entered the right 
temple and exited through the left side, the victim spun around 
counterclockwise. As he was falling, the attacker fired his 
weapon again to produce a second wound in the abdominal region. 
The bullet entered [words indistinct] and left a wound on its 
way out near the right hypochondrium. 
  This account of the events was duly and completely confirmed 
by eyewitness testimonies, by the results of the autopsy and a 
forensic histology, and by a ballistic study that established 
the position of the victim and the attacker and the trajectory 
of the projectiles. 
  Mario Aburto Martinez was subdued by people who were around 
the victim, immediately arrested, and placed at the disposal of 
the Federal District Attorney General's Office. Based on this, 
it can undoubtedly be concluded that the two shots were fired by 
one person from one weapon whose cylinder contained two spent 
and two unspent cartridges. The former were next to each other. 
  Aburto Martinez underwent the sodium [word indistinct] test 
to determine whether he had fired a firearm. This test proved 
positive. In his initial statement, Aburto Martinez confessed 
to firing the two shots at Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta. He 
did so, as we said, in the circumstances already described in 
the presence of two people who represented him, local lawyers, 
and the president of the Human Rights Commission. 
  Mario Aburto Martinez, the 23-year-old perpetrator, is from 
Zamora, Michoacan. He has a primary school education and is an 
industrial mechanic. He said he has lived in Tijuana since he 
was 15 and has dedicated himself to working since that time. He 
confirmed that he was employed by Cameros Magneticos in Mesa de 
Otai and was domiciled in this city of Baja California. As for 
the weapon he used, he admitted acquiring it several weeks ago 
with the intention of using it for the incidents under 
investigation. He was arrested in the act and confessed to the 
crime with all the evidence against him. He will be remanded to 
the competent judicial authorities within the legally 
established time. 
  The case is not fully closed. There are still questions 
which, according to the law, must be taken to their final 
answers. The country requires it, and the citizens demand it. 
The instructions I have received from the president are 
specific in that sense. The contribution and participation of 
the legal authorities demand all their abilities and 
professionalism. All of society, for the benefit and 
tranquillity of all, expects clarity and stability. That is what 
it will receive as a result of the work of this institution in 
coordination with the competent governmental authorities of Baja 
California State. 
  The Federal District Attorney General's Office has had and 
will continue to have at all times the support and cooperation 
of the government authorities of Baja California State, to whom 
I publicly express my fullest recognition. Various state and 
municipal officials have actively participated in the 
clarification of this incident, thus affirming once more their 
previously demonstrated commitment to the cause of justice. 
  A distinguished Mexican was deprived of his life. Mexicans, 
however, will not be deprived of their determination to continue 
on the path of justice. Society demands justice, and there will 
be justice. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Valades] Allow me to speak, if you please. I am a serious 
government official, and I have given you the information. If 
you think that the person responsible for the crime and how the 
crime took place is not information, then I don't know what kind 
of information you want. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Valades] I want to add that this is a responsible process 
of 
information. The state authorities will not tolerate 
provocations of any kind. We do not practice an adventurous 
policy of information, and we will always strive to inform 
society with responsibility, objectivity, and impartiality. I 
have fulfilled my duty. I have announced it before you and will 
continue to do so. Good evening.

<F P=106> [Statement by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari on 24 </F>
March; place not given; from the "24 Hours" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] Ladies and Gentlemen: There is a general demand for 
justice in the face of the criminal act that ended the life of 
Luis Donaldo Colosio. I am committed to not allowing impunity. 
Yesterday I sent the Federal District attorney general to the 
scene of the incidents. He has conducted preliminary 
investigations and is ready to report the results to the 
competent authorities. I do not want any doubts, questions, or 
concerns to remain, so I have given instructions to the Attorney 
General of the Republic to create a special Deputy Attorney 
General's Office that will be in charge of thoroughly 
investigating the causes of this treacherous crime, fully and 
totally dedicating its time to this task. 
  In response to a request from Mrs. Diana Laura Riojas de 
Colosio and based on my own convictions, I have decided to 
appoint Miguel Montes Garcia for this important task of national 
interest. He will hold this post if the Permanent Commission of 
the Congress of the Union authorizes the request for leave he 
has made to the Supreme Court of Justice. 
  Miguel Montes is a outstanding jurist who is well known for 
his straightforward personality, his profound knowledge of the 
law, and his honesty. In carrying out his duties, Jurist Montes 
will have the support of the lawyers and expert investigators he 
may deem necessary to help him in this important mission. 
  The leadership of the Institutional Revolutionary Party 
[PRI] 
and the coordinators of Luis Donaldo Colosio's political 
campaign have endorsed this proposal. I will place at the 
disposal of the Deputy Attorney General's Office and Montes all 
the resources and necessary tools he may need to fulfill his 
responsibility of promoting justice and facing this inadmissible 
action for Luis Donaldo Colosio's family, the PRI, and all 
Mexicans. 
  The law will be enforced. Justice will be served.

  [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari issued an order 
stating that the national flag will fly at half mast on Friday 
[25 March] as a sign of national mourning. This means that the 
national mourning, which had been established for Thursday, will 
continue tomorrow. The order states that the measure is in 
keeping with the deep indignation and rejection with which 
Mexican society has rejected the assassination of Luis Donaldo 
Colosio, presidential candidate for the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party. 
  The order will be published in DIARIO OFFICIAL on Friday. 
The decision to prolong the national mourning until tomorrow, 
however, does not imply the suspension of labor duties. 
  The Finance and Public Credit Secretariat announced that all 
financial operations will resume tomorrow. This is important 
information bearing in mind that the national mourning will 
continue tomorrow. Financial sector operations will resume 
tomorrow. Banks and the Mexican Stock Exchange will resume 
their normal activities, according to the Mexican Bank 
Association.

<F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz Otero from Los Pinos Presidential </F>
Residence; from the "Panorama Newscast" -- live] 
  [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari returned a few 
minutes ago to the Los Pinos official residence. He was at the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] national headquarters, 
where he stood in an honor guard before Luis Donaldo Colosio's 
coffin. As we all know, he accompanied the body from the Mexico 
City international airport to the party's headquarters. The 
president was accompanied by his wife, Cecilia Ocheli de 
Salinas, and he was obviously dismayed. He told us he has lost 
his great friend and asked us to respect his sorrow. Let us 
listen to the recording. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] I have just stood in an honor 
guard 
before the body of Luis Donaldo Colosio. I went to the airport 
to pick up his widow, Diana Laura, and to pick him up. My wife 
and I accompanied her. Just a few minutes ago, we also 
accompanied her to her vehicle when she decided to leave. 
  I want to tell you that Mexico has lost a great man, and I 
have lost a great friend. I want to ask you to allow us to 
mourn him, and bid him farewell. Thank you. [end recording] 
  President Salinas' agenda today is private. Nonetheless, it 
is expected that at noon he will receive [Canadian] Prime 
Minister Jean Chretien, with whom he had to interrupt his 
discussions yesterday when the attack occurred which took the 
life of Luis Donaldo Colosio.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reactions within Mexico to the assassination of Luis Donaldo 
Colosio Murrieta, presidential candidate for the Mexican 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, which occurred on 23 
March in Tijuana, Baja California. 
  A report by Mabel Montoya indicates that the PRI's future 
has 
become uncertain following Colosio's assassination. According 
to the law, the party's National Executive Committee has the 
authority to hold another extraordinary convention to select a 
new candidate. Political analysts are saying it is too early to 
discuss this issue because the assassination has caused 
considerable consternation within the Mexican community and 
people are hesitant to mention possible candidates. The 
country's eight remaining parties have unanimously condemned the 
assassination and have suspended their campaigns until the 
situation normalizes. Meanwhile, Popular Socialist Party 
candidate Marcela Lombardo has accused the conservatives of 
promoting incidents like Colosio's assassination to hinder 
Mexico's "return to the path of the revolution." Mexican 
business representatives have pointed out that the assassination 
is the result of efforts to destabilize the country, and warn 
that it may disrupt Mexico's political life. Political 
commentators are saying that Colosio's death will have 
repercussions in every sphere of the country's political and 
economic life, affecting its stability and credibility. (Madrid 
EFE in Spanish 1635 GMT 24 Mar 94) 
  Economic analysts questioned by EFE say that Colosio's 
assassination does not pose a political or legal threat to 
NAFTA. They say, however, that it may slow down the flow of 
foreign investments, which is one of the main requirements of 
NAFTA. Our sources said the assassination will cause a panic in 
the stock market, which will stabilize once a new candidate is 
chosen. They add that if the PRI loses the elections, NAFTA 
will not be threatened by the opposition parties, which have 
said they will not annul it but will modify it. However, if 
instability increases, NAFTA opponents in the United States may 
request a revision of the agreement or even its annulment. Some 
experts believe the exchange rate may also decrease due to a 
lack of investments. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1922 GMT 24 Mar 94)

  [Text] Mexico City, 24 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- The Mexican 
Congress on 24 March approved a constitutional amendment to 
allow citizen participation in strengthening the autonomy and 
independence of electoral authorities. 
  The Senate agreed to modify Article 41 of the Constitution 
to 
promote greater independence of electoral bodies and to broaden 
citizen participation in the electoral process with an eye on 
federal elections scheduled for next August. The decision closed 
three days of special sessions called by the Permanent 
Commission, which is operating during the congressional recess 
between late December and 15 April, to examine and, as the case 
may be, approve electoral reforms. 
  On 23 March the Chamber of Deputies approved a bill to amend 
the electoral law that calls for a new structure for the 
electoral bodies and establishes new electoral crimes and 
stronger punishments for such crimes. 
  The amendments will go into effect after their publication 
in 
DIARIO OFICIAL and will be applied during the 21 August 
elections in which about 42 million Mexicans will elect a 
president and federal legislators.

  [Text] Amid rivers of human beings that inundated Felix 
Cuevas Avenue and the streets near the funeral home where a wake 
was held for the remains of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, 
Manuel Camacho Solis, peace and reconciliation commissioner for 
Chiapas, gave his condolences to the relatives of the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate. He captured the 
attention of political representatives and the media who were 
standing outside the funeral home. 
  Camacho Solis was asked about the incidents of violence in 
Tijuana, Baja California. He gave a brief message to the public. 
  [Begin Camacho Solis recording] I wanted to be present here 
publicly because my position has always been an open one. The 
things I have always wanted to do have always been open. I 
deeply regret what has happened. It is something very serious 
for the country's life. Before the eyes of the nation I want to 
make the following statement: Two days ago I said I did not seek 
to be president of the republic. After the incidents that have 
taken place, after this tremendous attack on the nation, I 
reiterate what I have already said. I do not aspire to be 
president of the republic. The fatherland is above everything 
and above everyone. [end recording] 
  [Hamburg DPA in Spanish at 2024 GMT on 24 March transmits a 
180-word report datelined Mexico City stating that "a crowd of 
Colosio's supporters today protested the presence of Manuel 
Camacho Solis, principal rival of the slain candidate for the 
Mexican ruling party's presidential nomination, when he appeared 
at the wake in a mortuary in this capital. 
  "Camacho, who declined to speak to reporters, arrived this 
morning in Mexico City from Tuxtla Gutierrez, capital of the 
southern state of Chiapas, where he had been flown in a military 
helicopter from San Cristobal de las Casas, seat of the peace 
negotiations with the Zapatist Indian organization."]

<F P=106> [By Theo Peters] </F>
  [Text] Mexico City, 24 Mar (DPA) -- Following the initial 
reaction of general dismay over the unexpected death of Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate of the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) of Mexico, intense 
speculation has emerged in local political circles as to whom 
will replace the assassinated ruling candidate. 
  Once the period of national mourning over Colosio's death 
has 
passed, the PRI national directorate will hold a meeting in the 
next few days to nominate a new candidate for the 21 August 
presidential elections. 
  According to an unwritten rule in the Mexican political 
system, the outgoing president, in this case Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari, has the prerogative of personally choosing or, as it is 
popularly known, "hand picking" the candidate who will replace 
him as president. 
  The names of two PRI politicians were mentioned in the 
beginning from among the possible candidates. The PRI 
politicians along with four other contenders lost the nomination 
to Luis Donaldo Colosio on 28 November: former Mexico City 
Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis and former Education Secretary 
Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon. 
  The other initial contenders, including Finance Minister 
Pedro Aspe, may not run for office because the Constitution 
specifies that a candidate cannot occupy a government post in 
the six months preceding the elections. 
  Surprisingly, Camacho Solis excluded himself as a possible 
candidate on Thursday when he emphatically declared that he does 
not aspire to become president of Mexico after attending the 
vigil for the assassinated candidate at a mortuary in the 
Mexican capital. 
  Camacho Solis, former mayor, foreign minister, and current 
peace commissioner in Chiapas thus reiterated what he said on 
Tuesday before Colosio's murder when he publicly denied any 
aspirations as a presidential candidate, thus ending extensive 
speculation in that regard. 
  Nevertheless, Colosio's unexpected death revived rumors of 
the subsequent appointment of Camacho Solis as the PRI's 
substitute candidate. His rivalry with the murdered candidate, 
however, increased the ruling party members' rejection of the 
peace commissioner following the murder. 
  Given Camacho Solis' self-exclusion, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce 
de 
Leon now appears the most serious contender for the position 
left open by Colosio. Zedillo was the murdered PRI candidate's 
campaign manager. 
  Considered a "dark horse" in the PRI convention in November, 
the 42-year-old Zedillo is known as a brilliant public official 
who is extremely competent in economic matters. He holds a 
doctorate from Yale University in the United States. 
  Salinas de Gortari appointed Zedillo programing and budget 
minister on 1 December 1988, a post at which he successfully 
transformed the budget deficit into a surplus and substantially 
increased government social expenditures. 
  After his appointment as education minister in January 1992, 
Zedillo became the center of a national controversy that forced 
him to withdraw two new history text books after broad circles 
rejected the revision of sensitive passages on Mexico's history 
and present situation. 
  Although Zedillo has a great deal in his favor to be chosen 
the new PRI candidate, the scarce popularity of this timid, 
introverted man seems to work against his aspirations. His very 
discreet public conduct has contributed to the enigma 
surrounding his personality.

  [Text] Nuevo Laredo, 22 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Mexican customs 
today refused a U.S. request for the return of two pickups 
loaded with humanitarian aid for Cuba that were detained in 
Nuevo Laredo on the Texas border. 
  The vehicles belong to the U.S. organization Pastors for 
Peace, which advocates the lifting of the blockade imposed by 
the United States on Cuba 33 years ago. 
  Israel Garza Salinas, a spokesman for customs in Nuevo 
Laredo, which is located in Mexico's northeastern Tamaulipas 
State, said the pickups were detained because they lacked and 
their owners have already initiated the process for their 
recovery. [sentence as received] 
  The pickups are loaded with $2,000 worth of books, 
typewriters, computers, medicine, and a parabolic antenna. They 
will be shipped to Cuba from the port of Tampico, Tamaulipas. 
  The cargo is part of the humanitarian aid which, earlier 
this 
month, the U.S. authorities prevented the pastors from sending 
to Mexico for later shipment to Cuba. 
  Garza said the U.S. authorities allege that the cargo of 
both 
vehicles was taken to Mexico secretly in violation of a U.S. law 
banning the shipment of strategic material to Cuba. 
  He said the Mexican authorities granted facilities so 
Pastors 
for Peace could bring the two pickups into Mexico on condition 
that they would request permits to do so and would pay a 
symbolic tariff. 
  On 9 March the Pastors for Peace caravan crossed into Mexico 
with 68 vehicles and 140 tons of humanitarian aid for Cuba.

  [Text] We have just received Bulletin No. 32 from the 
National Defense Secretariat denying reports that a significant 
mobilization of troops is taking place in the Chiapas region. 
The National Defense Secretariat also confirmed its unalterable 
and absolute determination to honor President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari's orders. 
  The bulletin also says the Mexican Army will not seek to 
negatively influence the peace and reconciliation process taking 
place in Chiapas for any reason whatsoever. The bulletin 
proceeds to explain that the troops movement taking place in 
Chiapas is mostly intended to relieve the units in Chiapas and 
at the same time give the soldiers who have been stationed in 
the region for a long time some rest. 
  In addition, the bulletin emphasizes that the land 
mobilizations have mainly been to resupply the troops with food 
and equipment. This, the bulletin indicates, has nothing to do 
with the cease-fire or the agreement to discontinue all 
hostilities during the time the negotiation period agreed on in 
Altos de Chiapas is in effect.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Manuel Alvarado] </F>
  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas -- Using advanced 
systems, the Mexican Army's Military Intelligence has been 
monitoring the talks between the Zapatist National Liberation 
Army [EZLN] and Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis since 21 
February. Although the monitoring started on 1 January, it was 
increased on 21 February. The Army has continued to intercept 
and record EZLN short-wave radio communications in the jungle, 
the mountains, and the city. 
  Communications were intercepted and the exact position of 
the 
EZLN delegates and Subcommander Marcos at the cathedral during 
the peace talks were pinpointed with laser sound-wave emission 
and reception systems, high-sensitivity microphones, and a 
satellite. Using this same system, Military Intelligence 
monitored the EZLN delegates' private conversations, their 
plans, and decisions. 
  A high-ranking Mexican Army officer, who asked to remain 
unnamed for security reasons, confirmed these monitoring 
actions. "Not even Camacho himself is aware that we know 
everything he said. We know everything. What the Zapatists 
thought is the only thing we still do not know," he said. The 
officer said that Military Intelligence installed a 
sound-tracking system using high communications technology 
imported from the United States. 
  With the aid of a map of the Cathedral of Peace and a laser 
system, the Army pinpointed the living quarters of the EZLN 
delegates and Subcommander Marcos, as well as the dining and 
meeting areas. "Sound waves reached us via a laser that was 
inside the Cathedral. The laser beam captured sounds, words, 
phrases, and entire conversations, and relayed them back to us," 
he said. 
  During an interview with the officer, he detailed the 
Military Intelligence's tracking and monitoring systems. The 
Cathedral of Peace was the monitoring target. That is where 
negotiations were held beginning on 21 February between Peace 
Commissioner Camacho, 18 EZLN delegates, Subcommander Marcos, 
and mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz. 
  By tracking the Cathedral by satellite, Military 
Intelligence 
located the living areas, the delegates, Subcommander Marcos, as 
well as the security personnel. The officer added that there are 
still temporary military "bases" in San Cristobal de las Casas 
and the 31st Military Zone. He said there are boards with radio 
communication sets, scanners, and telephones at these bases. 
Other boards hold laser beam systems, parabolic antennas, 
monitoring and reading systems, and microphone recording systems 
called "small birds," which read sounds from inside the 
Cathedral. 
  Four Military Intelligence members work 24-hour shifts at 
each base. They wear earphones and are in constant 
communications with the main base. The information is gathered 
with the high-sensitivity systems. The military prepares a daily 
report on the conversations monitored and sends it to the 7th 
Military Region in Tuxtla Gutierrez. The same report is sent to 
National Defense Secretary Antonio Riviera Bazan. 
  The monitors receive sound waves at the monitoring stations, 
the location of which the officer failed to mention. "The 
systems currently in use and during the talks include very 
sophisticated microphones planted in the outer walls of the 
Cathedral of Peace. They are very well concealed. They pick up 
information through the walls," he said. "The only way we could 
not listen would be if the walls were covered with lead. The 
laser beam could not penetrate them then and magnetic waves 
could not pass through." 
  The Mexican Army's actions are carried out clandestinely. A 
cease-fire and the suspension of military actions were agreed 
upon by the EZLN and the commissioner to begin the negotiations. 
<H5>  Espionage Activities </H5>
  In addition to espionage activities aimed at taping private 
conversations and negotiations between the delegates and 
Subcommander Marcos, they also scan EZLN communications in the 
jungle and mountains and from there to the Zapatist 
communications center in San Cristobal de las Casas. 
  Even before 1 January, the EZLN had been using a short-wave 
radio system of clandestine radio communications. Military 
Intelligence intercepted these EZLN classified conversations. 
They currently have a file with cassettes including 
conversations revealing their codes, locations, and activities. 
EL NORTE was able to obtain some of the cassettes taped by the 
military. Officially, these activities "do not take place", just 
like these cassettes "do not exist." The cassettes procured by 
EL NORTE were forwarded, along with others, to the 7th Military 
Region. Each of the cassettes are numbered and carry the date 
when they were taped. Approximately three cassettes carrying 
Zapatist conversations are taped daily. 
<H5>  Taped Messages </H5>
  Some of the taped messages say: "Copy... we must go to the 
watch tower... pending the saints and check on the men with the 
large hats" [Copiado ... hay que ir al mirador... pendiente de 
los santos y checar a los sombrerudos]. Some of the cassettes 
examined by EL NORTE's correspondent includes several codes 
indicating the names of bases, leaders, and information 
exchanges as well as cattle rustling activities and even the 18 
February arrangements to transport the Zapatist delegates to the 
cathedral. Most of the messages are either in tzeltal or tzotzil 
[Indian dialects], with a few in Spanish. 
  Some of the conversations taped include events like the 
CNDH's [National Human Rights Committee] visit to several 
Zapatist regions, the presence of reporters, and some EZLN 
activities. There are also talks on changing clandestine 
communications channels and cattle rustling activities. 
  These are some EZLN conversations taped by Military 
Intelligence and transcribed by EL NORTE: 
  1. "They were beaten up or something like that, over. I 
am being asked if they can go ahead with the preparation of the 
record even if it is for its sake, over... 
  2. Affirmative, but together with the CNDH. 
  1. Copy... 
  2. Together with a copy, and send that bastard with the 
milk because they left and the only thing you know about is the 
presence of the federales. 
  1. Send the big ears over there. If possible, try to 
brand them. At the house of the big hats, there are cots, 
refrigerators. Take all you need since you can use them. I do 
not know how many can come over here either. 
  2. I do not know, copy. 
  1. Come on Thursday. Well, if you can make it on Friday, 
it is to stay. 
  2. Buffalo says to go to crab [cangrejo]. They had the 
contract. We were the only ones to fail, but he knows why. I am 
going to send someone to represent me. You are going to have a 
talk with the contractor and he is going to tell you what he 
needs. 
  2. Copy. 
  1. If you know that the number of the base, try to get it 
out of him. 
  2. If you are hungry just get a hold of a big ears. There 
are salt bags there, use them. 
  Codes -- big ears mean cattle, buffalo is the EZLN leader, 
Zapatist soldiers are known as workers, and maseca which means 
base -- are part of the communications system. According to the 
taped conversations, the Zapatist bases are identified by names 
of saints and EZLN operations are coordinated by contractors. 
<H5>  Marcos: We Were Already Aware </H5>
  At one of the EZLN camps located in the jungle, Subcommander 
Marcos pointed out that they were already aware of Military 
Intelligence surveillance. "We knew we were being taped and 
spied on during the dialogue and that is why we took some 
precautions. We, as well as the mediator, were aware they were 
taping our conversations and everything else we said in private 
with the commissioner," the subcommander said. "We are also 
aware that intercepting our communications right now is contrary 
to the cease-fire and contrary to what they say is a search for 
peace." As a result of the eavesdropping, the subcommander 
indicated that they began to modify their codes as well as 
taking other measures.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas -- With a high-technology 
system, alleged members of Mexican Army Military Intelligence 
have spied since 21 February on the dialogue between the 
guerrillas and Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis. 
  Although their spying activities were initiated on 1 
January, 
they were reinforced as of 1 February. They have been 
intercepting and copying the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation 
Army] messages in the jungle, the mountains, and the city 
through short wave radio. By using laser systems in the sending 
and receiving of sound waves, high sensitivity microphones, and 
satellites they were able to detect the messages and the exact 
location of the Zapatist delegation and "subcommander Marcos" 
within the cathedral during the peace dialogue. 
  With this same system military intelligence reportedly had 
knowledge of the guerrilla delegates' private conversations, 
their plans, and agreements. A Mexican Army officer, who 
requested to remain anonymous for security reasons, confirmed 
the spy actions. Not even Camacho knows that we know everything 
he said. We know everything. The only thing we do not know is 
what the Zapatists were thinking, he said. 
  He explained that Military Intelligence used communications 
technology imported from the United States and Asia and 
installed a sound tracking system. With the help of a Peace 
Cathedral blueprint, and with the use of a laser, the 
dormitories of the EZLN delegates of the "subcommander Marcos" 
as well as the dining and meeting areas were located. 
  The sound waves reached us through a laser that was sent to 
the interior of the cathedral. The laser is sent and it returns, 
picking up sounds, words, sentences, and whole conversations, 
the officer added. 
  The espionage's objective was the cathedral where the 
negotiations between Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis, the 18 
guerrilla delegates, and Bishop Samuel Ruiz were held. The 
officer explained that on military bases there are desks with 
communication radios, scanners, and telephones. Parabolic 
antennas as well as reading monitors, and microphone recording 
equipment -- called "little birds" ["pajaritos"] -- that read 
the sounds inside the cathedral are located on other bases. 
  Four Military Intelligence members are engaged in 24-hour 
shifts at each base. They carry earphones and maintain constant 
communication with the main base. With the highly sensitive 
systems they collect information. Military personnel write up 
daily reports on the conversations. These are subsequently sent 
to the 7th Military Region located in Tuxtla Gutierrez. The 
same information is sent to National Defense Secretary Antonio 
Riviello Bazan. In espionage houses, not identified by the 
officer, monitors receive the sound waves. 
  "The system used during the dialogue currently includes very 
sophisticated microphones that are placed in the exterior walls 
of the Peace Cathedral. These are well hidden and they are able 
to receive information through the walls," the informer added. 
Besides the espionage activity, the guerrillas' communications 
in the jungle and in the mountains are being monitored.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Monsignor Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de 
las Casas, today attended a social medicine congress in 
Guadalajara and discussed the situation in Chiapas. 
  The military conflict in Chiapas has not ended. The fact 
that a cease-fire was achieved and a first round of talks has 
started does not mean the Zapatist National Liberation Army 
[EZLN] will lay down its weapons. They expect the agreements 
will be signed, it was stated in Guadalajara by Msgr. Ruiz, who 
added that the war is still on. 
  [Begin Ruiz recording] Perhaps it is believed the war has 
ended so it is not visualized. There is a war, there is a 
cease-fire, and there was a mutual determination -- although not 
in writing yet -- to gather forces where they are right now, 
without subsequent mobilization. A dialogue has started but no 
peace accords have been signed yet. However, this has been 
forgotten in the country. [end recording] 
  He said the Chiapas conflict is the shortest war in the 
world 
and the one which resulted in a dialogue the fastest. Msgr. 
Samuel Ruiz arrived in Guadalajara for the Sixth Latin American 
Congress on Social Medicine, during which he questioned the 
health aid given to socialist countries like Cuba.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Carlos Salinas at a ceremony to mark </F>
the 56th anniversary of the Mexican Government's expropriation 
of the oil industry; at Pemex, Mexican Petroleum, Headquarters 
in Mexico City on 18 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] Fellow oilmen, ladies, and gentlemen: The oil 
industry was expropriated 56 years ago. That was an action of 
national dignity that brings pride to all the Mexicans. It 
reminds us of the many efforts men and women have made to 
strengthen the fatherland and to turn oil into a tool for the 
development and well-being of all Mexicans. This is why this 
moment is very significant. It allows us to renew our 
nationalist convictions and to ratify our commitment to the 
country. 
  The nationalization of the oil industry by Lazaro Cardenas 
del Rio was a sovereign and just measure. The nation could not 
allow foreigners to ignore the state's supremacy. This is why 
it was a sovereign move. The state cannot tolerate disregard 
for the constitutional mandate that gives it exclusive ownership 
over this resource for the benefit of all Mexicans. This is why 
it was a just action. 
  These past few years have been years of changes to 
strengthen 
the country in the face of new international challenges and in 
the face of shortages and setbacks that have mounted through the 
years. 
  The national oil industry has been changing also, and it is 
being strengthened through the sovereignty and justice of the 
nation. This is happening because in today's highly competitive 
world only an efficient and modern industry capable of facing 
the uncertainty of international oil markets can continue to 
serve as an engine for the economy, a keystone of the 
government, and a confirmation that state control can serve the 
nation. 
  This was a just action. We are moving away from an 
inefficient and bureaucratic oil industry that benefited a few 
and that was in hands of a few. Now, this is an industry in 
which workers and management join together for the benefit of 
all Mexicans. 
  This explains the great efforts to enhance productivity and 
the support given to the states and regions in which the 
industry operates. This explains the sector's extraordinary 
contribution to public finances which, in turn, produces more 
for the needy. This explains the commitment to protect the 
environment -- a commitment that this enterprise has decidedly 
assumed. 
  Mexico has been in the position of having to defend its 
sovereignty on many occasions throughout history. This has 
allowed us to strengthen our integrity and has turned it into a 
fundamental element, thereby allowing us to be independent among 
the nations of the world, to stand firm before the world, and to 
reject any kind of meddling in our domestic affairs. 
  In the face of new ways of challenging sovereignty, we 
reevaluate and renew our nationalist will. 
  Today's modern exercise of sovereignty demands the defense 
of 
territorial integrity. It also demands more contact with other 
nations to defend our positions and to promote our projects in 
the face of heightened competition from other nations. This is 
why it is important to participate in world affairs in an 
increasingly active way. 
  This is why we must participate more efficiently in the 
marketplace to open new opportunities that benefit our homeland 
and make it stronger to enable it to be heard. This means to 
present, both within and outside the country, initiatives that 
can contribute to attaining national goals, thereby creating 
better opportunities for developing our homeland. This is 
precisely what happened in 1938, when oil was expropriated. In 
our time, we are defending sovereignty by working to strengthen 
and stabilize our economy; advancing in an agreement to improve 
democracy; and in particular, promoting social and legal justice 
throughout the territory of the nation. 
  We are doing this in a number of ways. One of them is by 
building enterprises such as this one -- modern and efficient 
enterprises that can accept renovations and make deep changes to 
meet new competitiveness and productivity requirements. We are 
diversifying production to compete in local and foreign markets 
with a great many more quality products at lower prices. Let us 
keep in mind that a decade ago, oil comprised more than 
two-thirds of Mexico's exports. Today, however, more than 80 
percent of our exports are manufactured products. This does not 
mean that we should stop supporting a product as important as 
oil, but, rather, we should further stimulate this industry and, 
at the same time, initiate other productive activities, 
diversifying them to create more jobs and to ensure higher 
income for the population. Because we have done this, low 
global oil prices have not had a greater impact on the country's 
finances. 
  Pemex [Mexican Petroleum] has been modernized. Its 
structures have been transformed to make them more efficient. 
Pemex has established a more consistent pricing policy, has 
increased production, and has embraced full respect for the 
environment. At the same time, Pemex contributes to regional 
development by decentralizing its activities toward various 
areas of the country. Pemex has increased production in all 
areas by lowering operational costs by 30 percent in five years 
and by turning out greater quality products, such as unleaded 
gasoline, which already represents nearly half its sales, and 
new diesel fuel with a lower sulfur content. Subsidiary 
organizations work efficiently and resolve the problems they 
encounter. Marked progress has been made in the debt 
amortization program, and the investment program, as has been 
noted, is being financed with its own resources. For the third 
year in a row, the total production of liquid hydrocarbons was 
higher than the level reached in 1982. 
  In this context, I wish to acknowledge the great effort of 
the oil workers and technicians who work in this enterprise, all 
of whom have shown willingness to talk and remain united in 
carrying out the necessary changes that enable Pemex to continue 
to serve the nation and all Mexicans. The workers' efforts and 
solidarity have made it possible for us to take additional steps 
toward new and greater productivity and efficiency. For this, 
the efficient leadership of Carlos Romero de Champs, secretary 
general of their union, has been very important. [applause] I 
also wish to congratulate the Pemex staff, particularly its 
director general, because they have intelligently faced the need 
for changes that today already show results in terms of the 
strengthening of Pemex. For this reason, I hereby give special 
recognition to the honest, responsible, and efficient labors of 
Francisco Rojas Gutierrez. [applause] 
  What we have done at Pemex underscores what a great national 
enterprise it is, and this shows we want it to continue to be a 
great national enterprise. The strengthening of Pemex is 
equivalent to ensuring its continued existence as a Mexican 
enterprise and as a state enterprise at the people's service. 
To have not transformed it as we did would have been equivalent 
to letting it weaken and, consequently, taking the chance of 
allowing Pemex to become the prey of private interests, whether 
local or foreign. Quite the contrary, to consolidate its 
restructuring, to make the enterprise more efficient and 
productive, to raise its reserves and its level of production, 
to improve its dealerships and marketing, to protect the 
environment with cleaner products, and to work united in Pemex 
and for all Mexicans is equivalent to guaranteeing that this 
enterprise will continued to exist and, in turn, continue to 
benefit Mexicans. 
  The best justification of the 1938 nationalization is to 
enable Pemex to remain as a state enterprise in the hands of the 
Mexican people; it is one of the world's strong and great 
enterprises. Friends, oil belongs to the Mexican people and 
exists for your benefit. This has been my commitment since I 
was sworn in as president, and this will be my standard of 
conduct to the last day of my administration. Throughout the 
changes experienced by Pemex, even in the free trade agreements 
we have signed with other countries, oil has always remained as 
a nonnegotiable property of the nation -- a property exclusively 
managed by the state for the good of all Mexicans. We have made 
good on our promises. Pemex is an example of a reinforced state 
enterprise. Oil is a strategic resource for our nation, and it 
will continue to remain the exclusive property of the Mexican 
people. 
  Pemex is now a stronger company that assures its future 
capacity as a state-run company. I reiterate, sovereignty and 
justice are invariably intertwined in the nation's collective 
conscious, and all government efforts have been shaped by this 
binary relationship that marks our Constitution and fully 
commits our willingness. 
  Pemex is now a stronger company and has a greater capacity 
to 
meet domestic as well as foreign challenges. Pemex is now a 
stronger company and more committed to development and to the 
well- being of all Mexicans. Pemex recommits itself to the 
future and the benefit of future generations. The government's 
responsibility to Pemex is fulfilled if it establishes 
conditions that guarantee Pemex's permanency as a state company. 
  We have constantly worked to meet this responsibility by way 
of our actions, and the actions we have undertaken are evidence 
of this. Currently, Pemex is stronger because it is more 
productive and efficient. It is guaranteeing the nation's 
energy supply, strengthening public finances for social 
expenses, increasing its reserves and investments, and 
restructuring its activities. Overseas, Pemex's strength is 
growing, and at no time will we ever agree to any international 
negotiations that attempt to subject Pemex's decisions to the 
will of anyone except the will of the Mexican people. [applause] 
  Yes, we have worked to strengthen Pemex with political 
actions and decisions. The strengthening of Pemex is the best 
way to guarantee that it will remain a state company. An 
unproductive and weak Pemex, or one subjected to foreign 
decisions, would be the best pretext for anyone who seeks to 
harm it. This is why we strengthened it. This is why, I 
reiterate, Pemex will continue under the ownership and control 
of the Mexican people. On this anniversary of the expropriation 
of the oil industry, we reaffirm that we will strive to 
invigorate Pemex, and with this commitment, we reiterate our 
nationalist vocation and our commitment to a stronger 
sovereignty. We will continue supporting Pemex with actions; it 
is an important state enterprise -- the pride of all Mexicans. 
[applause]

  [Excerpts] Mobilization continues and spreads against the 
French food aid to schools in Port-au-Prince and in the 
provinces. Following political lines, members of the Haitian 
Parliament openly oppose the arrival of the French ship. A group 
of senators led by Bernard Sansaricq stands against the arrival 
of the French ship. 
  On 23 March, demonstrators -- FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for 
the Promotion and Progress of Haiti] militants and those of the 
Capois La Mort, the same militants who thwarted the MINUHA 
[United Nations Mission in Haiti] on 11 October 1993 -- camped 
for two hours in front of the French Embassy in Port-au-Prince. 
One day before the scheduled arrival of the ship bearing food 
aid, tension seems to have moved up a notch. Rothschild Francois 
reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Francois] A demonstration was held in 
front of the French Embassy. Demonstrators were carrying 
placards denouncing Paris' attitude in the Haitian crisis: 
Democracy, Yes! France's food, No! [passage omitted]. 
  Other reactions include that of Serge Gilles, president of 
the Jean Xavier Foundation, who favors the arrival of the French 
food aid. Gilles says, however, that the international 
organizations must think in the future of purchasing those 
products in Haiti in order not to change the Haitian 
population's food habits. 
  [Gilles, in Creole] One can not turn up his nose at 50,000 
meals, but I understand the people who have reservations. 
However, I must be realistic because children are dying. There 
is no food. It is not the kind of aid that we would choose to 
receive, but we find it. Let us give it to the children, and let 
us talk with the people so that they change their aid if they 
give money. We do not need the money. They can set up an 
organization which can buy rice, beans, and oil here. It will be 
better for the Haitian people, for the Haitian nation. 
  The solution lies in lifting the embargo, in international 
cooperation that must resume immediately, in the appointment of 
a prime minister, in the installation of a government with an 
emergency program. That is where the solution lies. Until we 
agree on a solution so that the embargo is lifted and 
international cooperation resumes rapidly, if we can distribute 
the 50,000 meals, let us do so. 
  [Francois] The Senate office of Senator Sansaricq 
categorically opposes the landing of the French humanitarian aid 
ship. In a statement to Radio Metropole, Sen. Sansaricq took the 
opportunity to criticize the French policy in Haiti. Sen. 
Sansaricq announces that the Senate members will be present at 
the Port-au-Prince harbor to prevent the landing of the French 
ship. 
  [Sansaricq] It is unacceptable. The senators will be at the 
Port-au-Prince harbor on 25 March, and we will take all 
necessary measures to prevent the landing of this ship. It is an 
insult to the nation. It is an insult to the Haitian people. It 
is an insult to our intelligence that France, which has imposed 
an embargo on us for 30 months, now buys food from Guadeloupe to 
distribute in Haiti. Twenty thousand have died in Haiti. It is a 
real affront. The Senate strongly stands against it, and we will 
be there personally to prevent the landing of this ship. We will 
hold Philippe Seltz personally responsible for any scratch 
inflicted on a senator. We will be there with all the necessary 
strength in order to oppose the landing of this ship. [end

  [Text] Guatemala City, 22 Mar (Notimex) -- National Police 
sources disclosed today that approximately 3,000 Guatemalan 
union members have closed off the highway over the "Melendez" 
bridge leading to the Mexican border in the western department 
of San Marcos. Actions initiated about a month ago at the "El 
Carmen" and "Tecun Uman" border passes are part of a demand for 
a 40 percent wage increase or the granting of a 300 quetzals 
(more or less $50) monthly bond. 
  The takeover caused long car lines, which had to wait for 
the 
highway to the Mexican border to be cleared. The National Police 
(PN) also reported that security at the "La Aurora" airport had 
been increased given a possible takeover by state workers, who 
have threatened to take futher steps. Terminal Director Colonel 
Elfidio Diaz Solis stated that only passengers carrying travel 
documents as well as passports are being allowed to enter the 
airport. 
  Last week, at least 300 public employees blocked all entries 
and exits to the airport for more than five hours, which caused 
considerable discomfort to foreign and national tourists. Five 
weeks ago, almost two months ago, the National Federation of 
State Workers Unions (FENASTEG) began measures pressuring for a 
40 percent wage increase. So far, the government has said it is 
unable to approve the wage increase because of insufficient 
funds. Union workers have rejected these claims with their own 
evaluations indicating that the government does have sufficient 
financial resources.

  [Text] The presidential spokesman has denied that President 
Itamar Franco intends to declare a state of national defense in 
the country. He reported that the president met last night with 
congressional party leaders, but the national defense issue was 
not even mentioned. 
  President Franco never considered resorting to the 
constitutional instrument of declaring a state of national 
defense to solve the political crisis with Congress and the 
Federal Supreme Court [STF]. This was stated by Presidential 
Spokesman Fernando Costa, who added that reports indicating that 
the state of defense decree is supposedly already lying on the 
president's desk are false. The situation in the country is 
entirely normal, he added. 
  The subject was not even mentioned during the meeting held 
last night in Planalto Palace between President Franco and 13 
party leaders. 
  The party leaders guaranteed President Franco that they 
would 
not attend the congressional session today to approve 
Provisional Measure No. 434 on the conversion of salaries into 
Real Value Units [URV's]. 
  Last night President Franco ordered Fernando Costa to inform 
the media that the government makes no agreements with the STF, 
that the president of the Republic will not disrespect the law 
and the Constitution, and that the day for converting public 
employees' salaries into URV's is the 30th of each month, and 
not 20th as the STF wants.

  [Text] In a speech with which he closed the World 
Entrepreneurs' Meeting at the Carrera hotel, Chilean Foreign 
Minister Carlos Figueroa said Chile must preserve the universal 
direction of the development of its exports. He said that "we 
are not for the division of the world into huge commercial 
blocs," and that, consequently, this trend should not be 
fomented. 
  According to Figueroa, experience shows that markets are 
subject to "up and down cycles," and that no clear, marked trend 
has emerged in either direction so far. 
  In this regard, he recalled that the universalist strategy 
defined for the development of the export sector, in addition to 
being more efficient from an economic point of view, has the 
advantage of reducing the country's economic vulnerability. In 
this regard, he noted that the fight against protectionism is 
one of the axes of Chilean foreign policy. 
  Figueroa said the emphasis on unilateral economic 
liberalization "made us more competitive and played a decisive 
role in our joining the international community." He said, 
however, this policy does not exclude supplementary efforts to 
open new markets. 
<H5>  Diplomacy for Development </H5>
  In another speech he delivered on 14 March, Figueroa 
outlined 
his portfolio's role in this phase. He emphasized that Chilean 
foreign policy should attach priority "to diplomacy for 
development." The foreign minister said this policy provides for 
external action, which is not undertaken because of "mere 
goodwill" but "as a function of Chilean interest." 
  He added that foreign policy must accompany the country's 
development process, emphasizing that the internationalization 
of the economy calls for the Foreign Ministry's support in 
coordination with the other ministries. "It would be absurd and 
even self-defeating if we demand a monopoly of the country's 
external action." 
<H5>  Agreements </H5>
  In another speech during the entrepreneurs' meeting, 
Figueroa 
reiterated that Chile's unilateral strategy should be 
supplemented with "progress in multilateral and bilateral 
negotiations." He said that even though the Uruguay GATT talks 
has been a significant step forward, "we are not fully satisfied 
with its results." 
  In this regard, he emphasized that the policy of "multiple 
insertion" that the Foreign Ministry is proposing will have a 
priority area in Latin America and will seek to develop close 
ties with Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and "take 
advantage of the potential of existing agreements." 
  Figueroa added that for the same reason, they 
"enthusiastically welcome" the U.S. Administration's interest in 
negotiating a free trade agreement. 
  He also emphasized that Chile became an APEC (Economic 
Cooperation in Pacific Asia) member this year, highlighting that 
it is one of the most innovative aspects of Chilean foreign 
policy. He also mentioned Chile's interest in strengthening its 
relations with the European Union. 
  Finally, he underlined the role that Chile can play as a 
supplier of services and as the entryway to Latin American 
markets, based on "the network of our relations with our 
neighbors and our free trade agreements," also highlighting the 
role as a port of access to the Pacific Ocean that Chile can 
play with respect to other Latin American economies.

<F P=106> [Report by Laura Yakovsky; from "The Voz Andes Newscast"] </F>
  [Excerpts] For years the position had been talked about. 
Many Latin American countries promoted its creation, and, at 
last, during the International Conference on Human Rights held 
in Vienna the necessary conditions were present. However, the 
creation of the position of human rights high commissioner was 
delayed a few more months. The Vienna Declaration entrusted 
this task to the General Assembly. Some countries had 
misgivings, but then something crucial happened. A work group 
was created to dispel these misgivings, and its presidency was 
bestowed on Ecuadoran Ambassador Jose Ayala Lasso. Thanks to 
the diplomatic endeavors of the Ecuadoran representative an 
agreement was quickly reached by all governments. On 20 December 
1993 the General Assembly created the position of high 
commissioner for human rights. On 14 February 1994 Ambassador 
Ayala Lasso's efforts were rewarded with his appointment to the 
position. [passage omitted] 
  Ayala is described by Emilio Cardenas, Argentine ambassador 
to the United Nations, who has no doubts that the Ecuadoran 
diplomat is the ideal person for the position. 
  [Begin Cardenas recording] There are issues that develop on 
the international scene that are complex. At the same time their 
histories are not always well known or taken into account. In 
my opinion, these attributes of Ayala Lasso represent to all of 
us not only a source of pride, but also the hope that a person 
with his qualities will be the man who, for the first time, will 
adequately perform in the position of human rights high 
commissioner. [end recording] 
  The human rights high commissioner must be well versed on 
the 
topic and must have an impeccable reputation and a deep 
understanding of different cultures in order to perform his 
duties impartially, objectively, and efficiently. The 
resolution creating the high commissioner's position establishes 
that the high commissioner must have knowledge of all human 
rights issues in the civilian, political, cultural, and economic 
spheres. He also must respect each states' sovereignty, keeping 
cultural differences in mind, and must abide by the principle 
that human rights are universal and that all governments must 
help guarantee them. 
  [Begin Ayala recording] This is a very important decision 
taken by the United Nations, and it fulfills almost 50 years of 
aspirations. In my opinion, it fundamentally consists of 
creating a kind of spokesman for humanity's conscience, whose 
objective will be to contribute, through dialogue and concerted 
action, to the progress of human rights worldwide. [end 
recording] [passage omitted] 
  Ambassador Ayala Lasso has been Ecuador's UN representative 
since 1989. Formerly, he was ambassador to Peru, Belgium, 
Luxembourg, and the EEC, as well as the Ecuadoran foreign 
minister in 1977. He was also an international law professor at 
the Central University of Ecuador and has published articles on 
international issues in various newspapers. Ayala Lasso is a 
lawyer and economist and has several university degrees.

  [Text] La Paz, 24 Mar (EFE) -- Former Bolivian President 
Jaime Paz Zamora and his party, the Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left (MIR), protected Isaac "Oso" Chavarria, who 
is considered Bolivia's top drug trafficker, and allowed him to 
intervene in the government, according to a police report 
submitted to Congress. 
  The main MIR leaders today said the Special Antinarcotics 
Force (FELCN) report is "a conspiracy" to destroy the party and 
the possibilities of Paz Zamora's presidential candidacy in 1997. 
  Paz Zamora ended his isolation at his ranch in El Picacho in 
the city of Tarija, in southern Bolivia, and arrived in La Paz 
on 24 March to meet MIR leaders. 
  The FELCN report includes a list of chronologically arranged 
events from 1978 to 1994 that proves the relations and meetings 
the MIR leadership held with Chavarria and another group of drug 
traffickers, in some cases for delivering money, and in others 
for analyzing "how President Paz Zamora could help them." 
  Some 10 traffickers agreed to surrender under the so-called 
"repentance decree," with which the government guaranteed that 
they would not be extradited to the United States, and are now 
jailed in Bolivian prisons. 
  The FELCN report, which the Chamber of Deputies 
Constitutional Committee has evaluated since 23 March, surprised 
several circles because of the magnitude of the network that 
operated within the Patriotic Accord government, which was 
headed by Paz Zamora. 
  Isaac "Oso" Chavarria, who was arrested by the FELCN on 25 
January, "used the methods of an `intelligence' agent to foment 
`narco-influence' [narcoinfluencia] within the `leadership' 
(executive board) of the MIR," the report says, adding that 
Chavarria used his training as a former Bolivian Army captain. 
  The report adds that "Chavarria turned the fear of MIR 
leaders into an instrument for blackmail," forcing them to 
commit illegal actions to protect him "from FELCN efforts" to 
capture him. 
  Paz Zamora's sisters Rosario and Edith, and his private 
secretary Susana Seleme, along with acting MIR leader Oscar Eid, 
and Lieutenant Colonel Jorge "Coco" Velasquez -- the government 
house security chief, are mentioned in the report as the 
"liaisons" between the president and Chavarria. 
  The FELCN report says Chavarria tried to influence Paz 
Zamora 
-- through aide-de-camp Velasquez -- for the designation of 
high-ranking officers. The report mentioned the designation of 
Colonel Faustino Rico Toro as FELCN chief as one of the examples 
that reflected the alleged trafficker's intention to create a 
"narcostructure" [narcoestructura]. 
  Rico Toro, who was arrested in Cochabamba on 22 March and 
arrived on 24 March in La Paz, has been -- according to FELCN -- 
Chavarria's partner for 11 years. In 1983 he bought an apartment 
Rico Toro owned in Biscayne Bay, Florida, southeastern United 
States, and a house in the La Paz residential neighborhood of 
Irpavi. 
  In February 1991, Edith Paz Zamora and Lt. Col. Velasquez 
"arranged a meeting between Chavarria and the president at 
Edith's house in Obrajes (a residential La Paz neighborhood) to 
discuss possible replacements within FELCN, including the 
designation of Col. Rico Toro as commander," FELCN states in its 
report, which is attached to five case folders on the event. 
  The Constitutional Committee has asked FELCN to suspend all 
actions against MIR leaders until the conclusion of the 
congressional investigation.

<F P=106> [Article by "special correspondent" Gladys Bernal Barzola] </F>
  [Text] Atalaya-Ucayali, 16 Mar -- The president of the 
Republic, Alberto Fujimori, admitted here the existence of ties 
between some bad Armed Forces elements and drug trafficking, and 
noted that the courts of law and military courts must not allow 
these crimes to remain unpunished. 
  The president said: "It is not that there are alleged ties. 
There actually are ties. Therefore, the Military Court Supreme 
Council has punished many of the elements involved." 
  Concerning the case involving drug trafficker Demetrio 
Chavez 
Penaherrera [alias "Vaticano"], the president indicated that the 
courts of law have opened proceedings to investigate the 
existence of any ties the drug trade might have with police and 
the military. 
  Celebrating the opening of another proceeding in the 
military 
courts, the president noted that, had this proceeding not been 
opened, the drug trafficker called "Vaticano" suddenly might 
have been released. 
  After his activities in Atalaya-Ucayali, Fujimori 
emphasized: 
"We will be drastic and inexorable. To this end, however, it is 
necessary for the courts of law and the military courts to work 
in coordination to guarantee that serious crimes like these will 
not remain unpunished." Fujimori was accompanied by Japanese 
Vice Foreign Minister Shozo Azuma [name as published] and other 
Japanese Government officials who delivered a number of 
donations to families afflicted by natural disasters throughout 
our country. 
  Moving on, Fujimori noted that the circulation of an Army 
document stating that the media are engaged in a campaign to 
discredit the Army is part of the freedom in our country. 
  Fujimori stressed: "Everyone in our country, without 
exception, has a right to voice his or her opinion. Since there 
is freedom of the press, there is also freedom of expression for 
the people and the institutions." 
  In Fujimori's opinion: "This freedom of expression would not 
be allowed in any other country." He mentioned some examples of 
impersonation, involving people or institutions, that would 
warrant lawsuits in other countries. 
  Fujimori noted: "These cases do not happen here because 
there is full freedom of the press and freedom of expression." 
  Within this context, Fujimori was asked about the habeas 
data 
right [by which a citizen can ask a government to supply all 
personal data it has on him or her] included in the 
Constitution, a right that has been described by various 
segments as a threat to freedom of the press. 
  Fujimori stressed: "I agree with championing freedom of the 
press and freedom of expression. The way this habeas data right 
will be regulated, I am sure it will guarantee these freedoms. 
Therefore, those remarks about the existence of threats to these 
freedoms are groundless." 
  Moving on, President Fujimori announced that the draft of a 
letter of intent scheduled for signature with the IMF one and 
one-half months ago did not deserve his or the Council of 
Ministers' approval because it changed some of the government's 
goals that had been duly established. 
  These goals include investments in the social field 
involving 
infrastructure improvements in education, health, highways, and 
so on. 
  Fujimori noted: "I am sure the IMF will understand our 
goals. The economic stabilization and pacification goals are 
maintained. Nevertheless, a social program is required. We 
already have explained this social program to (IMF managing 
director) Michel Camdessus, who supports it, but we want it 
mentioned in the letter of intent." 
  Another issue discussed by the president involved the 
reorganization of the National Police, especially Dincote 
[National Counterterrorism Directorate], and the recent 
terrorist actions that elicited criticism in the sense that the 
government had lowered its guard, which was ruled out by the 
president. 
  Fujimori said: "This government actually has an effective 
antiterrorist strategy. The attacks do not represent a Shining 
Path revival or an ability to recover. Rather, they represent a 
weakness that we will use to our advantage within the same 
strategy." 
  Fujimori admitted that the police are experiencing an 
adjustment process, but explained that it represents an 
adjustment to a new situation in order to enhance effectiveness. 
  Fujimori stressed: "In this field, we will not lower our 
guard an inch. The change of commands has been criticized, but 
the National Police have been strengthened and organized to such 
an extent that they fulfill their duties under any command." 
  The presidential entourage landed at Atalaya airport, 
changing their initial course to a location in the Andean 
mountain range because of weather problems. 
  In Atalaya, Fujimori visited some hamlets and then went by 
helicopter to the San Jose de Cutivireni base where about 1,400 
Ashaninkas, rescued by a religious mission from the Shining 
Path, have been living since 1991. 
  Of the 1,400 Ashaninkas, of whom 350 are children, 465 
presented themselves voluntarily and 200 recently sought shelter 
under the Repentance Law.

<F P=106> [Report by Lusiana Colomine; all quotation marks as </F>
published] 
  [Text] Hilarion Cardozo, president of the Social Christian 
Party (Copei), yesterday made a dramatic appeal to the nation to 
rally around Rafael Caldera's government, claiming that there 
will certainly be designs to speed up a forceful solution -- in 
other words, a coup d'etat in Venezuela. 
  At a time when the country is apparently calm -- a calm fed 
by expectations created by the new government's search for a 
positive change in the course of the economy -- Cardozo openly 
reestablished fears of a rebellion or a popular uprising. In 
his opinion, "a democratic consensus was not restored" in the 5 
December elections because Caldera won the elections by a narrow 
margin. 
  "I hereby declare with unwelcome dread that President 
Caldera's democratic election, coming within the framework of a 
de jure state, is not a point of unity among all Venezuelans 
because there are still unsavory people who insist on continuing 
the crisis in the country. For this reason, I urge the 
government to make great efforts toward reorganizing democracy." 
  Cardozo's position can be summed up in three possible 
scenarios that could threaten the nation's peace: a 
self-inflicted coup, a rightist coup, or a leftist coup, without 
forgetting the possibility of agitation by subversive groups. 
  "I think all three of these elements are at work. Certain 
economic and social sectors, as well as Venezuelan capitalists, 
are trying to persuade the 27 November coupists into 
perpetrating what they describe as a civic-military coup. In 
addition, the people who had struggled in the Army as a military 
movement, who later became a political group, and who have now 
split into two factions with the separation of Chavez and 
Cardenas favor an insurrectional coup staged by a group of 
former guerrillas. There are some who say it is best to 
militarily support the president-elect to reinforce the 
government in this way." 
  Would President Caldera support a self-inflicted coup? 
  I do not think Caldera would. I know him very well. I 
received very good advice from him all my life. He used to tell 
me: Freedom and justice can be attained only through the law. 
Because of his age, and because of his experience, I do not 
think he believes such an action would agree with the law. 
  Cardozo thinks the possibility of a coup will become clearer 
when the coupists who have been acquitted leave San Carlos 
prison, "because many rebels want to participate in politics, 
but we do not know whether they want to do this by way of 
democracy or subversion." 
  According to Cardozo, the best political consensus ever 
attained in Venezuela's democratic history occurred in 1961 when 
the Constitution was drafted. A similar consensus should now 
bring together the government "to reinforce democracy." 
Cardozo also spoke firmly about "subversive techniques." "A 
coup is not the only way. There are subversion and dislocation 
techniques. There are psychological techniques to create 
conflicts and confrontations with one another. There are 
demoralization techniques. The government must be aware of 
this." 
  Cardozo says the government and Congress must act. He says 
democracy cannot work if the population upholding it is not 
incorporated into it. The government must aim its actions at 
resolving problems, such as the high cost of living; 
joblessness; lack of housing, health, and education; and 
personal safety. Only in this way can the people defend 
democracy. 
  "I want to tell you that the worst possible deal is to 
gamble 
on Caldera's failure, because the hope aroused by this 
government is based on him being a trustworthy man who maintains 
a clear social awareness. If this crumbles, and if this hope is 
turned into disappointment, those who benefit will not be the 
system's parties but those who believe that the only solution is 
one of a rebellious or military nature." 
  Cardozo voiced an already general concern, prevailing 
confusion. "If there are doubts along the way, it is because no 
one is clearly showing the way." In turn, he issued an appeal 
to Caldera, who must reach an understanding with all sectors of 
the country to restore the people's faith in democracy. 
  "The unification of the political, economic, and social 
sectors is required if we are to seek understanding. If this 
escapes Caldera's hands and a fight to the death is unleashed 
among the violent sectors to see who can protest more violently 
in the streets, chaos and national confrontation will be so 
great that they will be difficult to check." 
  Cardozo's news conference only lacked the musical background 
of the first movement of "Carmina Burana" by Carl Orff, because 
he finished his remarks with nearly biblical remarks reminiscent 
of an apocalyptic finale. Although he did not mention the 
"Antichrist," from his remarks, it is evident he is among us. 
This is why Cardozo advocated what he called "an alliance for 
good" for the sole purpose of making it possible for the 
government to meet the economic challenges at hand.

<F P=106> [By Herold Jean-Francois] </F>
  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 24 Mar (EFE) -- Members of the 
right-wing groups Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and 
Progress of Haiti (FRAPH) and Capois La Mort protested today in 
front of the French Embassy in Port-au-Prince the arrival this 
Friday in Haiti of a French ship with some 500 tons of food. 
  France Pierre, who is responsible for the group Capois La 
Mort (name of an independence hero), said that along with the 
food destined for some 50,000 students "there will also be 
French troops arriving to invade the country." 
  Emmanuel Constant, leader of FRAPH, said there were plans to 
conduct demonstrations to prevent the ship's arrival because, in 
his opinion, the expiration dates on the food sent by the French 
Government has elapsed and "will kill the children." 
  The French Embassy in Haiti, however, said the food destined 
for public and private school students is in good condition and 
that they will come with a certificate to prove the quality of 
the products purchased on Guadeloupe. In a communique published 
on Wednesday, the French mission added that the food shipment is 
part of the traditional assistance that several countries have 
been providing to Haiti. 
  Despite the information given by the French Embassy, 
right-wing groups continue to voice their opposition to the 
ship's arrival. Constant even accused the French Government on 
Monday of being "cynical because it is creating hunger in the 
country as a supporter of the economic embargo against Haiti but 
is now giving alms to clean its conscience." 
  According to Constant, the real solution is to lift the 
embargo so that Haitians "can satisfy their economic needs." 
Senator Bernard Sansaricq, president of one of the two boards 
of directors of the Senate, said that 13 senators will show up 
at the Port-au-Prince wharf on Friday to prevent the French 
humanitarian aid from being unloaded. "It is an insult to the 
nation, the people, and our intelligence that France, after 
imposing on us a 30-month embargo which has killed 20,000 
children, is now sending us food," said Sansaricq. He added that 
the group of senators has the means to prevent the unloading of 
the food. Sansaricq blamed Philippe Seltz, in charge of French 
affairs in Haiti, for what may happen to the senators who will 
show up at the wharf to protest. 
  Meanwhile, Serge Gilles, leader of the Nationalistic 
Progressive Revolutionary Party of Haiti (Panpra), said that 
even though this type of aid is not the most advisable thing it 
must be accepted to save the children. Gilles suggested that 
from now on the food someone may wish to donate should be 
purchased in Haiti. 
  The arrival of the ship with the food has been supported by 
Reynold Georges, leader of the Alliance for the Liberation of 
Haiti (Alah). Georges, who has supported the position of FRAPH 
and other right-wing organizations close to the military, said 
it is necessary to receive the aid to prevent the deaths of 
children. 
  Stanley Schrager, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Puerto 
Rico [as received], said it is difficult to understand the 
groups that do not accept humanitarian aid in the country. 
Schrager said that France wants to participate in the aid given 
to Haiti and feels that the gesture should be appreciated.

  [Excerpts] After a week of inactivity, the senators from 
the opposition and those elected on 18 January 1993 returned to 
the parliament to hold sessions in the Senate. The resumption of 
sessions on 22 March was a reply of sorts to the warning in the 
statements made by the U.S. ambassador in Port-au-Prince. 
William Lacy Swing had hoped for a normalization of the Senate 
with the presidency of Firmin Jean-Louis. But such was not the 
case. Edner Jean reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Jean] The warning from the U.S. Embassy 
clicked in the Senate -- but in a sense opposite to that 
Ambassador Swing had perhaps hoped for. The office led by 
Senator Bernard Sansaricq had not held sessions for three weeks, 
giving priority to the negotiations of the Alliance [for 
Parliamentarya Cohesion] which was trying to put an end to the 
internal divergence. 
  The first effect of the U.S. Embassy press release was the 
cessation of those talks. Alliance senators, divided on the 
question of the two offices, had to go back to their camp, which 
led Dejean Belizaire, president of this political bloc, to say 
that the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion owes its existence 
only to the firm determination of its members. He deplores what 
he calls the brutal interference of the U.S. Embassy in Senate 
affairs. 
  [Belizaire] If the international community has good reason 
to 
satisfy the whims of President Aristide and those of the 
legislators close to him and encourages them to violate the 
Governors Island accord, the New York pact, and the 
Constitution, the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion owes its 
existence only to the firm determination of its members to 
defend the Constitution and to promote an ideal of peace, 
justice, and democracy worthy of our ancestors' struggle to make 
Haiti into a modern state, independent and sovereign. The 
Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion deplores the brutal 
interference of the U.S. ambassador in the Senate's affairs. 
[end recording] 
  [Jean] Besides those protests from the president of the 
Alliance, the senators elected on 18 January, the main target of 
Mr. Swing's statements, reiterated that they had returned to the 
parliament to stay. Proof of their determination: In response to 
the Embassy's press release, they oppose a draft resolution 
severely castigating the office led by Firmin Jean-Louis. Let us 
listen to Romel Manigat: 
  [Manigat] The senators are setting a dangerous precedent, 
meaning the lack of respect for the decisions made by the 
majority, and are introducing a subversive parliamentary 
practice which consists of having recourse to foreign 
interference in order to influence the legal decisions of a 
legitimate power of a sovereign state each time the petty 
interests of a minority are threatened. Considering that Senator 
Firmin Jean-Louis, Julio Larossiliere, and Yvon Gislain failed 
in their constitutional oath provided in Article 109; 
considering that it is necessary to reinforce discipline in the 
Senate and to protect the Haitian nation's superior interests, I 
am requesting, if it please the honorable members of the Senate 
Discipline and Ethics Committee, that you propose to the 
senators a draft resolution requesting the application of the 4 
March 1994 resolution suspending the senators judged guilty for 
a four-month period with loss of their salary. [end recording] 
  [Jean] Another consequence of the press release from the 
U.S. 
Embassy is to remind the Bernard Sansaricq office that it had a 
government to dismiss and another to constitute as soon as 
possible. On that side, the senators from GARD [Action Group for 
the Recovery and Defense of National Sovereignty] and of the 
Alliance are mixing speed with haste. They do not agree on the 
best ways to achieve their goal. 
  [Unidentified senator] Starting 22 March, Prime Minister 
Robert Malval's resigning government is no longer authorized to 
deal with the day-to-day matters of the Haitian state. 
  Article 2. The day-to-day matters of the Haitian state will 
from now on be dealt with by the directors general of the 
various ministries of the first rank below the resigning prime 
minister and under the control of the legislative power. 
[passage omitted]. 
  [Jean] All things considered, despite the firm statements 
and 
the unreserved support of the Americans to the office led by 
Firmin Jean-Louis, the control of the Senate of the Republic 
seems to have definitively escaped the normalized office. In any 
case, the contested senators elected on 18 January proved on 22 
March their firm determination to challenge the international 
community, which was expecting a regularization of the situation 
in the Senate in order to vote on the legislators' plan. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Port Tortuga officials have spent nearly $200,000 on 
the project, not $0.5 million as announced by the commerce 
minister, according to Mole Saint-Nicolas Deputy Elie Plancher, 
who questions the benefits that the Haitian state can derive 
from the project that is not a bad investment on the whole. 
  [Begin Plancher recording, in Creole] In 1991, Aristide's 
Commerce and Industry Minister Jean-Francois Chamblain gave his 
theoretical consent to the project. This clearly means the first 
works should have normally begun, should have been in process. 
The communal commission gave its support to the project. On 9 
July, there was an authorization regarding the first step. This 
means the project could have started. But we can say, despite 
all those expenses made in this area by Port Tortuga S.A., there 
is not yet any legal document authorizing Port Tortuga to 
function properly in this area. So far, I am telling you, there 
is no agreement. The Haitian state has not given its 
authorization in a definitive manner for the start of the 
project. [end recording] 
  It should be noted that the Port Tortuga S.A. matter was an 
oustanding issue during the departure of [Commerce and Industry 
Minister] Saidel Laine in August 1993. In his memorandum on the 
occasion of his departure, Dr. Laine pointed out that his 
successor should contact several officials, such as those of the 
National Office [of Tourism], the management of juridical 
affairs, and the consultants to the minister's office. We 
learned from a source close to the former commerce minister that 
no decision was made before Laine's departure. 
  Furthermore, we learned that the Port Tortuga S.A. issue was 
discussed in the Council of Ministers on several occasions and 
was rejected each time.

  [Excerpts] The Commerce and Industry Commission of the 
lower chamber heard resigning Commerce [and Industry] Minister 
Louis Dejoie II on 23 March. It has never been a question of a 
sale, but only a lease contract between the Haitian state and 
officials of Port Tortuga S.A., said Minister Dejoie. I have 
never granted a portion of the national territory to any foreign 
company, Dejoie said at the conclusion of his conversation with 
the Commerce and Industry Commission of the lower chamber. 
  The commerce [and industry] minister was responding to the 
convening of the commission about the Port Tortuga matter on 23 
March. The PAIN [National Agricultural and Industrial Party] 
leader demanded a meeting in camera as he refused to provide 
explanations to the deputies in the presence of journalists. The 
Port Tortuga matter is nothing but a lease contract binding the 
Haitian State and the officials of that company for the 
exploitation of a portion of Mole Saint-Nicolas, according to 
Louis Dejoie: 
  [Begin recording] [Dejoie] There has never been a sale of 
land, either by Minister Dejoie nor the preceding [commerce] 
ministers, to a foreign company at any time. [passage omitted] 
  No contract has actually been signed between the Haitian 
state and Port Tortuga S.A. A draft contract was sent to 
[Minister of Finances and Economy] Rey -- who is also a party to 
this project -- for her signature. She has not signed. She did 
not want to sign -- (?according to) a letter I received from her 
-- [prior to] certain formalities. [passage omitted] 
  "I have signed no contract." [passage omitted] This is a 
draft contract between the Haitian state and a company called 
Port Tortuga for the exploitation of something touristic. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Louis Dejoie II says he is waiting 
for apologies from the head of state if [Aristide] really asked 
him to put an end to illegal activities. The PAIN leader pointed 
out that he has never received any request from President 
Aristide about Port Tortuga S.A. 
  [Dejoie] [Passage omitted] "I do not really know whether 
President Aristide made such a statement. But if he did," which 
counters even all that I have said here -- and everybody has 
evidence that Dejoie (?could) never sell or alienate a tiny plot 
of land -- I am waiting for retractions from the president of 
the Republic. 
  [Unidentified journalist] "So, he has not asked you (?to do) 
anything?" 
  [Dejoie] "He has not asked me (?to do) anything. I have 
received nothing from the president. Neither would he dare ask 
me for something like that when I have done nothing contrary to 
the law." What I can tell you is that I believe in the honesty 
of the president of the Republic, who would not say such things 
if he did not have information. "In my opinion, leaflets saying 
that Dejoie has done this and that have been sent out." 
  [Journalist] "Will you give up the project?" 
  [Dejoie] No, the project cannot be given up. "The government 
has resigned. A new government has to be established and take 
care of it." [end recording]

  [Text] Yesterday, Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) 
President Enrique Iglesias and President Violeta Chamorro signed 
a $39.6 million credit for the agriculture sector and small- and 
medium-scale industry. 
  Following a tight agenda and after opening the plenary 
session of the IDB's Eighth Central America, Belize, and Panama 
Governors Meeting, Iglesias went to the presidential palace 
where he stated the Nicaraguan economic program must be made 
flexible to adjust to the nation's needs. Iglesias was referring 
to the upcoming signing of the so-called ESAF [Enhanced 
Structural Adjustment Facility] with the IMF. The agriculture 
sector will receive $16 million to increase the production of 
basic agricultural products for local consumption and exports. 
  Microindustry businessmen will be granted $23.6 million from 
the loan. Shortly after signing the loan, Iglesias said: "These 
credits are part of our conviction that Nicaragua's development 
is on the right road." He said: "I believe the most difficult 
part of the adjustment process is behind; it is very important 
that organizations like ours support the nation's development 
now." 
  Iglesias emphasized that our people have gone through many 
years of adjustments; now the true battle for production and 
growth starts. He indicated that the IDB believes it is possible 
to realize a development program in Nicaragua. This financial 
institution has approved approximately $400 million in credits 
in the past three years. 
  Economy Minister Pablo Pereira reported that the program to 
support small-scale industry is being transformed from a simple 
ministry program to a mixed institute in which private and 
public sectors as well as the banks will participate. 
  Foreign Cooperation Minister Erwin Kruger said this week was 
outstanding after prestigious personalities in the financial and 
political sector concluded their visits here. Yesterday, Kruger 
signed an exchange of notes with Kuniji Suzuki, charge d'affairs 
of the Japanese Embassy, for an $8.5 million donation to 
purchase agriculture and industrial supplies. 
  The IDB president continued his agenda today by holding a 
work meeting with the Economic Cabinet. He also met with 
ministers of the social sector: Health, Social Action, and 
Emergency Social Funds. A group of advisers and Joel Riley, IDB 
representative in Nicaragua, accompany Iglesias at these 
meetings. At the meeting with the economic and social team, all 
matters relating to the loans the IDB approved for the next four 
years are being discussed. Yesterday, Iglesias met with 
Legislative Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman and 
Sandinist National Liberation Front leaders.

  [Text] Managua, 22 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- The Nicaraguan 
Government has approved a "presence and control" program along 
the southern border with Costa Rica, which includes the creation 
of new police, immigration, and customs offices following a 
series of minor incidents, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto 
Leal said today. 
  The "vital" measures are aimed at "reaffirming our 
sovereignty and presence" on the San Juan River, a Nicaraguan 
waterway that marks the boundary with Costa Rica, the Nicaraguan 
foreign minister added. "We have had our backs to the river for 
decades," the Nicaraguan foreign minister said. 
  In mid-March Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus 
questioned the Nicaraguan authorities about the charging of a 
toll in the village of La Trinidad, where the Sarapiqui River 
meets the San Juan River. 
  Leal said the Nicaraguan authorities will continue to charge 
citizens of third countries, who sail on the San Juan River, 
five dollars per tourist card as in the case of tourists who are 
transported on motorboats operated by Costa Rican agencies. 
Ernesto Leal added that Costa Ricans who identify themselves as 
such will not be charged for sailing on the river in compliance 
with the border treaty signed between both countries on 15 April 
1858. The treaty gave Nicaragua the exclusive right to exercise 
full control over the waters of the San Juan River from its head 
waters at Lake Nicaragua to its mouth on the Atlantic Ocean, 
Leal said. "This means Nicaragua exercises full sovereignty and 
jurisdiction over the river from source to mouth, Leal said. 
  In addition, the border treaty grants Costa Rica the right 
in 
perpetuity to free navigation on the river for trade purposes 
from its mouth on the Atlantic up to a point 3 miles below 
Castillo Viejo. "Nicaragua respects Costa Rica's rights and 
will continue to respect them," according to Leal, but he noted 
that the treaty explicitly excludes tourism and "that is why 
these types of services (rendered by Costa Rica) are not covered 
by the treaty." 
  The minister said that the new police stations will be 
installed in El Papaturro, El Castillo, El Delta, and Sarapiqui, 
and that there will also be new immigration offices in the 
aforementioned locations as well as in San Juan del Norte. The 
office at the mouth of the Sarapiqui River will be reinforced. 
The project's initial phase includes a tourist information 
program throughout the entire San Juan River area in addition to 
fishing and hunting controls to preserve the region's natural 
resources along that waterway. 
  Leal added that a bill is being drafted prohibiting 
foreigners from purchasing lands in the border regions, which 
will soon be submitted to the Nicaraguan National Assembly. "We 
are also going to have a substantial presence in the area with 
health and education programs at the border," according to Leal, 
who also said a border landmark plan will be implemented between 
boundary markers 13 and 14 along the border with Costa Rica.

  [Text] Mexico City, 24 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Canadian Prime 
Minister Jean Chretien told the Mexican Congress today Mexico 
has the capability to overcome the blow stemming from the murder 
of the presidential candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary 
Party [PRI]. 
  Referring to Luis Donaldo Colosio's murder before members of 
the six congressional political parties, Chretien said: "I am 
sure they (Mexicans) will bear this tragedy and will continue to 
advance in democracy." 
  Chretien addressed Congress following a one-hour meeting 
with 
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari that was held this 
morning at Los Pinos Presidential Residence in Mexico City. 
  Chretien underscored in his speech: "In moments such as 
these, we are all brothers and sisters, and I am confident this 
tragedy will bring us even closer and that Mexico will continue 
to fight to defend its democratic values." 
  Minutes before, in his welcome speech to Chretien, PRI 
Senator Silvia Hernandez said with a weak voice and tears in her 
eyes that, unfortunately, he "came at a time of national sorrow 
which under other circumstances would have been a time for 
celebration." 
  Hernandez conveyed the respect Mexicans feel for Canada due 
to its democratic and multicultural background and for being a 
nation that has always offered its support to developing 
countries, showing its concern for the respect of human rights 
and the environment. 
  At the end of his speech, members of the various parties 
asked Chretien questions regarding NAFTA, the situation of 
Indians in Canada, and Quebec's separatist movement. 
  Regarding NAFTA, Chretien explained it substantially 
improves 
the bilateral agreement Canada had with the United States and it 
will help improve living standards in North America. 
  He said he is convinced of the advantages free trade 
entails, 
recalling the Canadian economy has been able to rank among the 
seven most developed economies in the world because its export 
sector is the leading source in job creation. 
  Chretien said Canada is the main exporter per capita in the 
world, clarifying the NAFTA members (Canada, the United States, 
and Mexico) must still work on the definition of subsidies and 
dumping to establish more clear rules and a more just trade. 
  Regarding the situation of Canadian Indians, he said the 
solution has been and should be "cultural diversity in unity" so 
that instead of trying to westernize the Indian peoples, "they 
prefer to guarantee them their autonomy." 
  In this sense, Chretien said Quebec's separatist movement 
has 
always existed, and although it might be legitimate, he is 
confident people in Quebec prefer to remain members of the 
Canadian federation. 
  Chretien began today a three-day official visit to Mexico 
where he had planned to attend a dinner in his honor offered by 
President Salinas de Gortari. 
  The event was canceled, however, due to the attempt against 
Colosio Murrieta, who was shot in the head and abdomen following 
a political meeting in the northwestern city of Tijuana. 
  Three hours after the attack, Colosio Murrieta, 44, died in 
Tijuana General Hospital despite the efforts of a team of 
doctors to save his life.

  [Text] At the invitation of the Communist Party of Cuba a 
delegation of the Social Democratic Party from northern Hessen, 
Germany, is visiting Cuba. They have held extensive meetings to 
become familiarized with current situation in Cuba. (Ernest 
Whasthle), member of the presidency of the committee of the 
party and senator of the Federal German Parliament, gave his 
opinion on the blockade that for more than three decades the 
United States has imposed on Cuba: 
  [Begin (Whasthle) recording in German with 
passage-by-passage 
translation into Spanish] Our delegation agrees that this 
embargo should be eliminated in the interest of the Cuban 
people, and we will do everything we can to contribute to the 
lifting of the U.S. embargo. However, we must stress that we do 
not have enough pull to influence the decisions made by the U.S. 
Government. 
  However, I can say that we agree with the many groups, some 
of which are in the United States, that think the embargo should 
be eliminated. [end recording] 
  The Social Democratic Party delegation from northern Hessen 
visited Santiago de Cuba Province where they held meetings and 
talks to strengthen future relations. 
  [Begin (Whasthle) recording in German with 
passage-by-passage translation into Spanish] We selected 
Santiago de Cuba for our meetings for a definite reason. This 
region and ours have similar structures. We have conducted a 
very broad and constructive political dialogue. This dialogue 
should be continued at the provincial level. We also expect that 
our visit serves to encourage the Social Democratic Party to 
establish ties at a higher level. [end recording] 
  During their stay, the delegation visited several 
institutions and economic and social centers of interest, which 
will allow them to have a panoramic view of the current Cuban 
situation.

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Juan Carlos Roque Garcia </F>
and guest Osvaldo Rodriguez from the weekly JUVENTUD REBELDE -- 
live] 
  [Text] [Roque] Osvaldo Rodriguez from JUVENTUD REBELDE is 
here with us to determine who has the money, or who has that 
excess currency. 
  [Rodriguez] Look, it is rather difficult to talk about who 
has the money, because everyone says: Well, who has it, because 
I do not have it. And there are those who even question whether 
there is an excess of currency. I believe some colleagues are 
still thinking that this issue of the 14 salaries, or the 14 
months of pay cannot be true, that there must be an error. 
  However, when you make an analysis of the bank 
accounts....[pauses] I recently had access to some data, to some 
research made by some banks and some economic research centers, 
and they said that 10 percent of those people having savings 
accounts accrue almost 60 percent of all the money saved by 
savings account owners in the People's Savings Bank. If we 
analyze the fact that the money can be kept by society in the 
same manner, we are saying that approximately 10 percent of the 
active population, 10 percent of the people who are actively 
working, must have accrued that high percentage of money. 
  [Roque] But this is only a supposition. 
  [Rodriguez] A supposition in the case of the money on the 
street, but there are precise data about the money kept in the 
bank. I believe that... 
  [Roque, interrupting] Are you trying to establish a parallel 
line between the number of people who have money in the bank and 
those who might have that excess money on the street? 
  [Rodriguez] Yes, I base this on the argument used by the 
economists as well. I agree with them in this point: If you 
analyze that 10 percent of the people with savings accounts have 
60 percent of all the money, and that the remaining 90 percent 
of savers have only 40 percent of the money, well then we can 
transfer that to the remaining money which is circulating 
outside and we can say, not categorically, but we can logically 
say that 10 percent of the working people have most of the money 
which is circulating today. 
  [Roque] You said you would delve deeper into this subject. 
  [Rodriguez] Yes. Let us delve deeper. I believe that in 
order 
to reach certain conclusions regarding the highly complex issue 
of who has the excess currency... [pauses] because we cannot 
know since we cannot conduct a door to door search because that 
would be a violation of everyone's right to keep money at home. 
Thus we have to conduct an anlysis in an effort to get an 
approximation of the truth. 
  For example, underground market prices... 
  [Roque, interrupting] The black market, so that everyone 
understands clearly. 
  [Rodriguez] What happens is that according to economists, 
the 
term black market does not encompass everything. The black 
market is only that part of the market based on illegal 
merchandise. However, when you and I exchange our rations of 
cigarettes or rum, that is also the underground economy and this 
we are seeing more of this. When I render a service and charge 
you a lot, that is the underground economy. It is not precisely 
the black market. Thus, the term underground economy is broader. 
  [Roque] I am glad you clarified this because in a recent 
program we were left with doubts about the underground economy 
and the black market. 
  [Rodriguez] The black market falls within the underground 
economy. 
  [Roque] Let us return to our subject. 
  [Rodriguez] When we analyze the underground economy and its 
prices, undoubtely it is clear that most people participating in 
the underground economy have gone from purely buyers to sellers. 
Why, if this did not happen before, is it taking place now? When 
you speak with the people you hear: I have to sell something in 
order to buy something. 
  The high prices are not set by the money in circulation 
money 
or the lack of supply alone, but because there are people with 
plenty of money capable of affording that merchandise because 
they have money in abundance. You and I, perhaps, who live off 
our salaries alone, who do not have another source of income but 
our slaries, find it hard to fully participate in that market 
because that is a market which has become smaller. 
  [Roque] The truth be told, we frequently have no choice but 
to access that market. 
  [Rodriguez] We have to because, as everyone knows, the 
official market does not guarantee all the basic needs of the 
Cuban family nowadays. Therefore, we have to access that 
informal, underground economy to meet a number of needs, 
merchandise as well as services. 
  [Roque] Particularly, essential needs. 
  [Rodriguez] The most necessary. For example, food. That is 
one of the things for which most people have to access that 
market. However, when you access this market you are not in a 
position to do this at any price because you are not well off. 
Undoubtedly, there is someone who sets the prices. That someone 
is the people who have a lot of money. 
  In a study....[pauses] There are several studies on the 
underground economy; this has not escaped study by specialists. 
They have studied the underground economy thoroughly in terms of 
research and polls. Although there is no data, because is it 
highly difficult to determine the percentage of merchandise 
moved, there are estimates. It is known that at the same level 
that the national economy experienced a shortage of supplies, 
the underground economy experienced the same crisis, in the same 
proportion. The movement of merchandise within the underground 
economy for 1992 was estimated at 15 billion pesos. This does 
not mean 15 billion in the hands of the underground economy but 
that the same peso that you give someone is given to someone 
else and the money circulates. 
  [Roque] What should be understood clearly is that the 
phenomenon of the underground economy is not a trait of the 
special period alone. It is something that has been there all 
along and it happens in other societies. Capitalism also has an 
underground economy. 
  [Rodriguez] Capitalism is the seed. The origin of the 
underground economy origin lies in capitalism. 
  When you analyze the underground economy and the way it 
operates in a capitalist country, and the way it operates in our 
country, the characteristics are very different. 
  [Roque] Well, I think we are moving away from the objective 
we have set for today, which is to learn who has the excess 
currency. 
  [Rodriguez] I want to return to that part when we got into 
the disquisitions about the way the underground economy 
operates. We must clearly understand that the merchandise 
circulating within the underground economy comes from the state 
companies or from the state stores. 
  [Roque] And this is caused by the lack of control and leads 
to theft, etc. 
  [Rodriguez] Of course, theft is fostered by the lack of 
control, and this lack of economic control is what gives an 
injection of merchandise to the underground economy. Many people 
often ask: And if that merchandise is found in the black market, 
why is it not controlled and returned to the state stores? 
  I think this is a question asked by everyone, even by the 
company directors. They ask: Well, what happened to my 
merchandise? It was taken from my store. Well, when you make an 
inventory at the end of the year, it is reported as a loss, and 
often not even as loss because it involves products not yet paid 
for, and this is what unleashes all these problems we are 
experiencing in our own homes. 
  [Roque] It is time now to arrive at a conclusion on this 
subject. 
  [Rodriguez] Well, to conclude this idea, it is obvious that 
a 
small group of citizens have most of that excess of currency, 
more than 11 billion pesos -- well, it was 11 billion by 
December. We are now deep into 1994, and perhaps it must have 
already increased to almost 12 billion, or perhaps to 11.5 or 
11.6 billion, because I have no idea of the rate of increase in 
the excess currency. But it is known that only a small number of 
citizens have it. It is known that this small group of citizens 
are today called money hoarders [macetas]. We know that these 
people are the ones who are today affecting the tranquillity and 
the development of this society. But the workers in the 
workplaces are loudly demanding firm action against these 
people. I believe that when action is taken against them, and 
when measures are adopted to make a financial balance, when 
there is control, and when production supplies the markets 
again, then we will talk about other subjects, but no longer 
about excess currency or who has the money, or what problems are 
there to increase the black market. 
  [Roque] I am happy that you concluded your statement in this 
manner, but I want to make it clear to you that there is more 
need to make people aware of this problem, and that they must be 
willing to solve it. 
  [Rodriguez] Of course. I think we must say that this will 
not 
be solved by collecting all the money, because money is not a 
problem in itself, but something that serves to barter, a means 
of barter, but it is nothing materially important. 
  [Roque] I want to thank Osvaldo Rodriguez for being with us 
to answer this question: Who has the excess currency?

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Carlos Santana Ojeda and </F>
guest Renato Recio from TRABAJADORES newspaper; monitored in 
progress -- live] 
  [Text] [Recio] ...First of all, the workers understood 
clearly that cost is a basic factor in measuring efficiency. 
They realized that if we do not discuss and control costs, if an 
economic analysis on the basis of costs is not conducted, the 
goal of increasing profitability and reducing losses and state 
subsidies to enterprises is not feasible. What has to be done 
first is to identify and measure our expenses. These expenses, 
material and labor, are reflected in the cost. This concern you 
said the workers have, which is true, is being expressed even as 
a mandate. Nowadays, there is a trend which I believe is very 
healthy: The workers are demanding of the management that a cost 
system, even a minimal one, be established and made known, 
especially where the expenses are incurred -- the workshop, 
department, shift, and the smallest unit. This is based on the 
concept that those who can do the most to reduce costs are those 
who incur the expense. 
  I believe that it is very important to analyze a phenomenon 
typical of our economy in the last few decades. I dare to 
advance the following opinion: In general, we in Cuba have 
underestimated the importance of the financial elements of the 
economy. 
  By this I mean the following: We have worked above all on 
the 
basis of material balance. We have balanced consumption values 
and material values in terms of their productive function. 
However, we have frequently dismissed the importance of 
financial factors and, above all, the problem of determining, 
controlling, and reducing costs. 
  [Santana] Yes, there have been other priorities. As you 
said, 
material production has been a priority. However, material 
production per se has not had a quality, a use value. Despite 
these concerns, it has not always had an appropriate use value. 
  [Recio] There are things we cannot separate at this time. I 
have used this chemical image: If you separate hydrogen from 
oxygen, you no longer have water. Likewise, if you separate the 
material value of things, in terms of their utilitarian and 
social value, and take away the financial element reflected by 
that value, then you are simply canceling the entire quality of 
the economy. 
  [Santana] Of course. You were referring to cost as a 
financial factor. I think we need to speak next of the elements 
comprising cost because I think that is very interesting. It is 
something not frequently discussed. Many people are surprised to 
find that there is not a single cost, but many. The issue of 
cost has been discussed by the workers on the recently concluded 
process of Parliaments in the Workplaces. 
  [Recio] First of all, I do not believe this process has 
concluded. I insist on the idea I have stressed before: This is 
only the beginning of the process. We have to maintain 
everywhere that style of frank language, open discussion, and 
realistic analysis of the economic problems at each workplace. I 
believe the union movement is committed to maintain that work 
style and method. Therefore, I do not speak of its conclusion. I 
said that it is only beginning. 
  [Santana] Therefore, it is a process that has completed its 
first round, its first phase. You were saying that there are 
many ways of expressing cost and that there are several 
components to cost. 
  [Recio] I prefer to mention the two main elements: salary 
costs and material costs. Those resulting from the work force 
expenses and those from the consumption of raw material, energy, 
etc. Most workers are aware that this is expressed in the 
phrase: Cost per peso of consumer goods production. 
  What is happening today in Cuba -- highly affected by 
economic decline -- is that the cost per peso of consumer goods 
production exceeds the peso. This is no good. In order to 
produce a peso you have to spend more than a peso in resources. 
  [Santana] There is the fact that 69 percent of Cuba's 
enterprises are unprofitable. 
  [Recio] That means that in those enterprises it costs over a 
peso to produce a peso's worth of goods. Expressed in this 
manner, one can see that if this situation were to be sustained 
for long, life would become almost unaffordable because you are 
consuming more in production than you are producing. This is in 
financial terms. It is good to explain this here. It can be 
expressed in financial terms. However, the list of material 
expenses is unending. Thus, no one can express it in terms that 
consuming such and such things produces such and such a thing. 
Therefore, the financial, monetary, cost expression is the 
shorter and more objective way to determine whether one is 
expending more or less in production than the value of the goods 
produced. I believe that should be constantly the focus of the 
Cuban workers, as owners of the means of production. 
  [Santana] You also mentioned the cost of salaries. You spoke 
of material expenses. Undoubtedly, the large personnel roster in 
almost every workplace in Cuba cannot continue to exist if we 
want 69 percent of the enterprises to become profitable. It is 
clear that excessive salary cost is an unjustified expense of 
production. I believe this is under discussion today. Many think 
they can solve their problems by reducing the number of workers. 
I believe that is part of the problem. You said this was one of 
the elements of cost but not all of it. There are other 
elements, such as material costs, and many others such as 
efficient production, maximum use of the machinery, compliance 
with all the technological requirements, etc. I believe this is 
an element that has to be stressed. 
  [Recio] All this, obviously, promotes cost reduction or, if 
improperly done, increased costs. I want to warn about something 
which is my opinion. We should not exaggerate the importance of 
the salary factor in our highly elevated costs. I believe that 
inflated rosters at the workplaces have very negative 
consequences for productivity and work organization. However, 
not always, everywhere, does the main factor determining 
elevated costs lie in salaries. I believe this always requires a 
casuistic analysis, an analysis place by place in order to 
reflect in situ what portion of the costs is determined by 
personnel salaries and what portion results from poor use of 
material resources. I believe we have to insist on this idea in 
order to avoid confusion. We also make extremely poor use of the 
material elements consumed in the productive process. 
  We do not have to go far. We are once again linking finances 
and production: The problem discussed recently -- the lack of 
payment among enterprises -- also contributes to the pilfering 
of resources, which results in cost increases as a result of 
unfulfilled material consumption. I believe this also deserves 
analysis. 
  [Santana] You were speaking of something very important: 
payment among enterprises. 
  [Recio] I believe that in the previous National Assembly 
session this issue was highlighted. This is very interesting 
because it is unthinkable that there are enterprises subsidized 
by the state whose failure to charge other enterprises for 
production is also being subsidized. There are also enterprises 
that refuse to pay. I have spoken with many managers who tell 
me, yes, they try to collect but their counterparts do not want 
to pay. Within this there is a whole bureaucratic apparatus, the 
bank, etc., which complicates payment. I believe this issue is 
very interesting. In no other system is it acceptable that you 
deliver a product and are not paid for it by the receiving 
enterprise. As you said, this is the main tool of those who 
steal and pilfer, since there are no controls. 
  [Santana] Also a tool of those who are inefficient and 
negligent. 
  [Recio] All I have to add is that this absurd, truly absurd 
situation of those selling goods not getting paid, and those 
purchasing not paying, takes place only because of the break we 
had -- which was intensified at the beginning of the special 
period -- between the financial and production factors of 
production. Fortunately, we are undergoing the process of a new 
mentality, of rethinking economic logic and rationale. The 
struggle for efficiency has become an essential element to save 
the fatherland, nation, socialism, and its accomplishments. 
  I believe that all -- workers, administration workers, 
managers, political organizations, and people in general -- have 
to get involved with the issue of cost. 
  [Santana] Yes, I believe it is very important that all 
workers get involved in this problem. I believe it is essential 
to the Cuban people, not only in production but also in terms of 
state finances where we should try to make costs a constant 
concern. 
  [Recio] That sector speaks primarily of expenses because 
they 
have no production. They do get a profit, in general, for 
production. However, in health as well as in education and 
culture, we have seen a willingness to reduce costs, to measure 
how much is expended on primary level education and how much on 
each disease treated at hospitals. 
  I believe that all these concerns and interests may result 
in 
an improvement in the Cuban economy.

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" Program with host Carlos Santana Ojeda and </F>
guest Eloy Concepcion from TRABAJADORES newspaper -- live] 
  [Text] [Santana] This is "Straight Talk" on Radio Rebelde, 
today with Eloy Concepcion, a reporter from the newspaper 
TRABAJADORES. Today we are going to talk about the embezzlement 
and theft of agricultural products in Havana Province. 
  Eloy, I recently read a commentary you had written in the 
TRABAJADORES newspaper in which you talked about this topic, and 
you pointed out some interesting facts. You said that 
approximately 30 percent of Havana Province's agricultural 
production was stolen or embezzled. I am thinking of last year's 
production and that must be equivalent to 1 quintal of 
agricultural products per citizen in Havana City. That means 
that the average four-person family did not receive 
approximately 400 pounds per capita. That is for a four-person 
family nucleus. 
  Most likely, many of them had to buy these products from 
these same thieves and unscrupulous speculators on the black 
market and at the black market prices. If to this we add the 
fact that last year approximately 1 million people from Havana 
participated in agricultural tasks in Havana, we can say that 
they have stolen twice from us, because besides stealing the 
product that corresponds to us they stole the work we did. 
  Eloy, I would like to hear your opinion on this matter. 
  [Concepcion] Yes, this is a situation that besides being 
caused through theft is caused through embezzlement and 
misappropriation. It is a spider web and a complex network that 
has a present effect, which affects the people and the country's 
economy. It has a future effect in that it creates an atmosphere 
of social indiscipline, it undermines values that correspond to 
our society and, therefore, it has a double negative effect. 
  With regard to agriculture and the problems of theft, 
embezzlement, and misappropriation of agricultural products in 
Havana, we reached a point at which we needed to stop it dead in 
its tracks -- to use words that are understandable. We had to 
take measures that were a bit drastic and which have not been 
accepted by the perpetrators of those crimes or by those who 
allowed or have been allowing these immoral acts to happen. 
  In contrast, from information I have gathered during visits 
I 
made in the last few days, there is general acceptance among the 
population in the two provinces: in Havana and Havana City. 
  [Santana] Nevertheless, you pointed out in your report that 
for some irresponsible and undisciplined people the measures 
taken have been bothersome. 
  [Concepcion] Yes, logically. What was happening here was the 
following -- let me see if I can paint a picture for you so that 
the listeners can understand where the problem lies. The problem 
begins with the lack of control and demand by the administrative 
leaders of the enterprises. Some of these have been accustomed 
to being very generous with state resources. 
  There is a key element here -- and later on I will talk more 
about the theft of products -- which is an exchange between 
enterprises and organizations from Havana Province and Havana 
City Province, which has created the philosophy of you scratch 
my back and I will scratch yours. In other words, one enterprise 
has welding rods and other resources that the agricultural 
enterprise, the farm, or the Basic Cooperative Production Units 
[UBPC] lacks. In exchange for these products that belong to the 
state which are diverted from the capital to that enterprise, 
that enterprise, which produces tubers and vegetables, gives 
this enterprise, which provided those resources, agricultural 
products. 
  [Santana] Eloy, you were talking about a very interesting 
subject, the small-time peddler relationship among companies, a 
relationship which basically is that policy of you scratch my 
back and I will scratch yours. I think this emerged some time 
ago during those big meetings among businessmen in Havana 
Province and in Havana City. This is a sort of a barter, a sort 
of liberty adopted by some directors, which if they did this for 
their companies' benefit, they would be more efficient, but by 
doing this they are only showing that they are small-time 
peddlers [mercachifles], and not businessmen, and much less 
socialist businessmen. 
  [Concepcion] Yes, and you know that over the past few years 
there has been a process of change in the treatment of man. All 
companies and organizations have been worried -- and they are 
right -- about giving better service to their workers in their 
cafeterias, and I think they have been classified as quality 
cafeterias, and there are organizations which are examples 
nationwide. 
  But we must say the following: Most of these organizations 
and companies from the capital and nationwide have been given 
some self-consumption plots. And many of the self-consumption 
ploys of those organizations are a bit abandoned. 
  What happens is that one organization or company asks 
another 
agricultural company to provide a truck load of tubers for its 
cafeterias -- and this is good -- but in practice what is 
happening is that the truck load of tubers is not used just to 
feed the workers, but many of those products are sent elsewhere 
to feed the pigs, because it is easier to raise pigs than to 
produce vegetables and tubers in those self-consumption plots 
they have, it is easier than working, I would say. 
  [Santana] Is this the embezzlement you were talking about? 
  [Concepcion] Yes. Then they give better service to the 
workers at the cost of others. That is, you will probably find 
cafeterias giving good service but when you eat there you will 
realize that what is consumed there is not produced by that 
company or organization. So, good service is given to the men at 
the cost of other workers who produce, or at the cost of a 
product that should have been sent to the people and was not 
sent because of that unauthorized appropriation. 
  [Santana] I think this is very interesting because people 
always talk about theft, and those who steal or swipe those 
agricultural products are always condemned. But you are 
mentioning something new that has not yet been publicly 
mentioned, or at least I have not heard it yet. This is an 
interesting element because state companies obviously have an 
influence on the fact that not enough food is reaching the 
neighborhood markets. 
  Of course the worker is happy when in his cafeteria he can 
receive all those products, but of course the businessmen and 
the people who are involved in this type of embezzlement must be 
punished and sentenced severely. 
  [Concepcion] The problem is that we have developed a bad 
habit, and we have had this bad habit not only during the 
revolutionary process but long before that, when people used to 
violate the country's rules and laws. There are rules about what 
companies, what organizations, and what cafeterias should 
receive these products on a priority basis, but through the 
established channels, that is, through the official channels. 
But what happens is that this has become a regular practice, 
that everyone is going to the fields to look for products for 
their cafeterias, and they do this together. Thus, a false 
relationship of partnership and friendship has been created -- a 
false concept of interentrepreneurial or interorganizational 
relations that violates the government-established regulations 
-- and therefore rules must be established. 
  [Santana] The people will undoubtedly agree -- the workers 
in charge of production who see this type of misappropriation 
which Eloi mentioned. You were going to speak of theft. I 
believe this is also something very important and irritating. 
  [Concepcion] Yes. That is a situation we had and still have 
in certain cases in Havana and towns of the two provinces, as 
well as nationwide. I do not want to limit it to Havana. This is 
a national problem, not a problem of Havana City and Havana 
Province alone. It is annoying not being able to get a product 
in your local market, for example plantains, garlic, or 
agricultural products in general, and have a neighbor sell it to 
you at elevated prices -- a head of garlic for eight pesos, etc. 
This exhausts the resources of the people who have to endure 
this problem. 
  The state and government have the responsibility of stopping 
this dead in its tracks, to take measures which might seem 
drastic but are nothing more than what is necessary to put an 
end to the romp and social indiscipline that has been corrupting 
en masse the people who directly or indirectly had no choice but 
to participate in it due to the situation we are experiencing. 
  There are people who, logically, disagree with these 
measures. When you can establish order, those who prefer 
disorder are not pleased. Certain organizations and enterprises 
which were involved in this romp do not support the measures. 
This is also the case with transportation drivers who have 
directly or indirectly participated in this romp. Therefore, the 
blatant theft....[pauses] There is the case of the 4,000 heads 
of garlic on (Moscovits) cars in Matanzas, as a matter of the 
fact, one of the actions taken was the confiscation of those 
cars. 
  This was creating an unbearable situation, and the people 
have been demanding that drastic measures be taken to put an end 
to it. This does not mean that this is going to solve the 
problem. These measures are being taken because in the next two 
months at least 3 million quintals of potatoes and other crops 
will be harvested in Havana Province. The goal of these measures 
during these two months is to avoid and halt the theft and 
ensure that the products reach the people and the cold storage 
facilities and that the truck does not drive around leaving 
sacks of products on the way, stealing and supporting a black 
market that is impoverishing the people. The state has the 
responsibility to take whatever measures are needed to solve 
this. 
  [Santana] I believe that we also have to stress that there 
cannot be extremes because we usually either fall short or 
overshoot the mark. We have to avoid extremes with relatives or 
friends of farmers returning home, not because they went to buy 
from the farmer, and bring back home a small amount of 
agricultural goods. 
  [Concepcion] The problem does not lie with the bicycle 
riders 
or friends who go to the farm to get a bag of products. This is 
not a problem of small bags or bicycle riders. Many of them 
might be involved in this as a business, but these measures are 
not for these people. There might be certain injustices as is 
logical. These measures are aimed at the agricultural profiteers 
who have inundated Havana with products in an undertaking which 
is already an unbearable problem. 
  [Concepcion] They do this on a large scale. I believe that 
what you say is true. This is not aimed at people getting a bag 
of products. It is aimed at large-scale profiteers.

  [Text] Havana, 23 Mar (EFE) -- The Cuban Government 
approved a law whereby stiff fines, ranging from 500 to 1,500 
pesos (the same amount in dollars at the official exchange rate) 
will be imposed on persons authorized for self-employment who 
violate official regulations. 
  More than 141,000 persons, 4 percent of the 3.5 million 
Cuban 
workers, currently work independently on the island, protected 
by a law that was approved in September and increased to 136 the 
number of self-employment categories. 
  The new law, announced on Sunday, establishes a fine of 
1,500 
pesos for persons who engage in an activity that is not legally 
authorized, and 1,200 pesos for persons who do not have a 
certificate that accredits them as independent workers. A 
Cuban's average salary is approximately 150 pesos per month. A 
1,200-pesos fine will be imposed on persons acting as 
intermediaries to provide services or sponsor the sale of 
products manufactured by a self- employed person, whether 
legally authorized or not. 
  Likewise, Cubans who take advantage of the market conditions 
to sell or offer services at clearly exorbitant prices can also 
be sanctioned by the law. 
  Also, a fine of 600 pesos will be imposed on persons who 
violate health regulations; and a 1,200-pesos fine to whoever 
"hides, denies, or forges information that is officially 
requested by the appropriate authorities, or whoever 
intentionally obstructs the authorities' actions. 
  According to statistics from the Labor Research Institute, 
more than 141,000 Cubans are self-employed, including 
electricians, masons, carpenters, photographers, electric 
appliance repairmen, masseurs, and craftsmen. Persons who want 
to work independently must obtain a permit from the State Labor 
and Social Security Committee, and are required to pay a tax to 
the State Finance Committee, based on the type of activity they 
carry out. In order to obtain self-employment authorization, a 
person has to be retired, a housewife, or be registered under 
the subsidy system due to a reorganization or paralysis of 
activities. Professionals in active service and directorate 
board members are excluded. 
  Cuban economic authorities have affirmed on more than one 
occasion that self-employment is necessary given the lack of 
full-time jobs and the state's inability to provide certain 
services. Since the authorization of self-employment jobs 
increased, handicraft street vendors, bicycle parking 
attendants, and automobile washers, and other articles have 
proliferated throughout the island. In most cases they offer 
their services and products in dollars.

  [Text] A group of the state security fighters have been 
promoted to the immediate upper rank at a ceremony held in 
Santiago de Cuba Province on the occasion of the 35th 
anniversary of the foundation of that organization, which is 
subordinate to the Interior Ministry. Reporter Carlos Sanabria 
Marrero will give us further details from that province: 
  [Begin recording] [Sanabria] The activities carried out at 
the Interior Ministry building were summed up by Esteban Lazo 
Hernandez, Politburo member and first secretary of the Cuban 
Communist Party in that province. 
  [Lazo] I want to wholeheartedly congratulate you for this 
35th anniversary, and also for what you are doing, for the work 
you are doing for security, and for the awareness of working 
efficiently, and for the things that are still to be done, 
because I know that you will continue working with that same 
awareness to overcome problems and to be increasingly better 
every day. I hope to celebrate many anniversaries here with you 
along with the history of this glorious and everlasting Cuban 
revolution, placing symbollically on the hearts of each of you 
that medal which symbolizes the heroes of the difficult war, the 
heroes of the war that decides the fate of a nation. Fatherland 
or death! We will win! [end recording]

  [Text] Yesterday, Politburo member Jose Ramon Machado 
Ventura toured several Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC] 
in Granma Province. Machado was accompanied by Alfredo Enriquez 
Pina, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in Granma 
Province. During his tour, Machado Ventura stressed that the 
UBPC's were created because of the need to increase production. 
  [Begin Machado recording] If this does not go well, we will 
have very serious problems throughout the country. From there we 
must care for them and work with them in discussions if there is 
any indication that there may be problems. [Words indistinct] 
the stability that will guarantee and satisfy the needs of the 
cooperative, the worker, and his family. That is a guarantee 
that will keep the people here. 
  Other problems will follow: better quality, higher yields. 
All this will follow, but this year we must organize ourselves. 
We cannot begin next year with new ideas or new interpretations. 
If there is anything to interpret, move, or change, it should be 
done now, during these next months. That is why I am visiting 
you. We are trying to do this now so that later on no one gets 
off track. 
  This is not to sell plantains along the road. We sell the 
plantains on the road, we get so much, and we sell the rest. 
That is not the way. You are here to produce more because by 
selling plantains on the road maybe with half of the production 
you get more because it is sold at 10 times the price, yet we 
must focus on producing more. When we talk about earning more, 
we want you to earn more, but based on your production, not 
because your product was sold at a higher price, rather because 
you produced more. [end recording] 
  These were statements by Politburo member Jose Ramon Machado 
Ventura in Granma on the UBPC's, after visiting several of these 
collectives in this eastern province.

  [Text] The assessment of the emulation program shows that 
Camaguey's sugarcane workers are giving their all. The harvest 
workers have put a poor start behind them and, dismissing 
difficulties, are fulfilling the trust placed in them. This is 
the reason Camaguey was selected the winner in the eighth 
regional emulation period with results surpassing those of Las 
Tunas and Holguin Provinces. In sugar produced, they are second, 
nationwide; in sugarcane grinding, yield, transportation, 
planting, soil preparation, and power provided to the national 
electric system, the region is the vanguard. This is very 
encouraging and, in the opinion of specialists, denotes 
efficiency and stability, even though there is still much to do. 
  The emulation assessment was chaired by Jose A. Naranjo, 
chief of the commander in chief's coordination and support 
staff, and Politburo members Nelson Torres, Sugar Minister, and 
Julian Rizo Alvarez, first secretary of the Communist Party of 
Cuba in Camaguey Province, in addition to the first secretaries 
of Las Tunas and Holguin Provinces. 
  It became evident in the analysis that an extraordinary 
effort is required in the next 40 days in order to meet the 
unalterable commitment of the three provinces decisive to Cuba's 
sugar program. It was stressed that the doctrine of fulfilling 
daily tasks is not only beautiful but essential, now more than 
ever.

  [Text] Guantanamo, Santiago de Cuba, and Granma Provinces 
have a good chance of fulfilling their respective sugar 
production plans during the current harvest if they continue 
working with the same impetus in facing the difficulties 
preventing higher yields and industrial efficiency. This was the 
conclusion of the sugarcane harvest assessment meeting held on 
25 March in Santiago de Cuba in the presence of Sugar Industry 
Minister Nelson Torres; Jose A. Naranjo, head of the commander 
in chief's Coordination and Support Staff; and Esteban Lazo and 
Juan Carlos Robinson, respectively first secretaries of the 
Communist Party of Cuba in Santiago de Cuba and Guantanamo 
Provinces. 
  At this meeting, it was proposed that the easternmost 
provinces exchange moral and material support to ensure that the 
current goals are met -- particularly supporting Granma, which 
will be reporting to the National Assembly of the People's 
Government in July and therefore has to meet all its goals. 
  The eastern region was proclaimed the best in Cuba in the 
last 20 days; and within this area, Guantanamo is in first

this meeting at the Heredia Theater, the Salvador Rosales Mill 
from Songo-La Maya Municipality received the Union of Young 
Communists' Setting the Pace banner for surpassing its grinding 
potential for the past 40 days.

  [Text] In Havana, a plenum of the national committee of the 
National Association of Innovators and Efficiency Experts [ANIR] 
is evaluating ANIR's role in defense, the sugar harvest, and the 
food program. 
  Politburo member Maria de los Angeles Garcia stressed that, 
in addition to their continuous efforts to find solutions to the 
nation's other problems, ANIR members should look upon 
preserving equipment, machinery, tools, and other resources -- 
many of which are not being used because of the lack of spare 
parts -- as a challenge. As regards ANIR's participation in the 
sugar harvest, the plenum agreed on the need to expedite the 
recyling and production of spare parts needed to operate 
combines, compressors, and boilers at the sugar mills, as well 
as to use animal-powered equipment more efficiently.

  [Text] Jorge Rogabruna, vice director of hygiene and 
epidemiology in Havana City Province, said that the law that 
prohibits the rearing of pigs in the central municipalities of 
the capital and in apartment buildings and city neighborhoods 
remains valid. He stated that in Centro Habana, Habana Vieja, 
Cerro, Plaza de la Revolucion, Playa, and Diez de Octubre the 
rearing of those animals is prohibited and that it is not 
authorized in urban localities of other municipalities in Havana 
City with large concentrations of people. Rogabruna said that 
there are control mechanisms at the zone and municipal levels 
through the people's councils which send commissions to visit 
the owners of the animals and warn them of the infraction they 
commit by keeping those animals.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 
Havana radio and television in Spanish between 22 and 25 March. 
  Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 22 March reports that the 
Matanzas 
sugar industry has fulfilled the sugarcane planting plan for 
March 10 days early. The number of caballerias scheduled to be 
planted in March was 390, but 458 caballerias have been planted. 
Thus, the plan has been surpassed by 17 percent. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 22 March reports that thanks to 
the help of workers from Santiago de Cuba in harvesting 
approximately 17 caballerias planted in plantains, Ciego de 
Avila Province will send 200,000 quintals of plantains to the 
markets of Santiago de Cuba Province this year. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 22 March reports the following: 
  Tourism sector workers in Varadero have donated to the 
public 
health sector more than $17,000 made in tips during February. 
  A solidarity group from northern Italy has made a donation 
to 
Cuba valued at more than $15,000. The donation, which includes 
medicine, powdered milk, soap, and disinfectants, is earmarked 
for polyclinics in Camaguey Province. 
  The German airline LTU announced that it will increase 
tourist flights to Cuba in 1994. LTU is one of the biggest 
airline companies in the world dedicated to tourism. Cuba is one 
of the LTU's most important long distance stops. The company 
markets over 850 rooms at the Tuxpan and Bella Costa Hotels in 
Varadero and at the Carisol and Los Corales complexes in 
Santiago de Cuba. 
  Armando Puello, president of the Dominican Republic's 
tourism 
association, highlighted the increased links between Dominican 
companies and the tourist hub of Santiago de Cuba. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 23 March reports that after six 
years of work, the Cubanacan Travel Agency on 22 March was 
introduced in Havana City as Fantastico, the new name with which 
it will operate as of this date. According to Fausto Garcia 
Diez, manager of this agency which is subordinate to the 
Cubanacan Corporation, the agency aspires to receive no less 
than 300,000 tourists and to collect $11 million in 1994. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 24 March reports that 51 
foreign 
and 184 national companies are participating in the commercial 
fair running from 22 to 27 March at the Convention Palace in 
Havana. The fair seeks to increase the flow of currency in our 
economy and to show the results of joint ventures with foreign 
companies in the spheres of foods, containers, packing, 
refrigeration, and printing equipment. The presence of 
businessmen from 12 countries, among them Brazil, Mexico, and 
Spain, reflects solidarity with Cuba. 
  In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that Cuba has one of 
the lowest fertility rates in the world, despite the fact that 
it has one of the highest wedding rates in Latin America. 
Moreover, the report adds, the prominent Cuban jurist Holga Mesa 
has said that for every 10 births, there are nine abortions in 
Cuba. 
  Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 24 March reports that 
because 20 caballerias of tomatoes in the Caujery Valley are 
infected with white blight, the Guantanamo Province tomato 
harvest will be 60,000 quintals less than projected. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 25 March reports that rice, 
cane, and other crops in Sancti Spiritus Province this year will 
receive some 70,000 tons of organic fertilizers known as 
bioearth [bio-tierra] to replace the imported chemical products. 
It adds that the country must produce at least 1 million tons of 
bioearth to be used on agricultural land to reduce the demand 
for industrial fertilizers. Bioearth is a mixture of ash, 
vegetable waste, and microorganisms which increase the amount of 
potassium, phosphorous, and silica in the soil.

  [Excerpts] Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and 
Progress of Haiti, FRAPH, have called on ministers from the 
resigning government to refrain from going to their offices. 
This is their ultimatum. FRAPH is threatening to dislodge the 
ministers of the resigning Malval government. As of 28 March, 
the ministers are no longer to go to their offices. 
  FRAPH has harshly criticized the management of the resigning 
government. During a news conference held by FRAPH leaders on 24 
March, the most virulent criticism was aimed at the ministers of 
health, agriculture, and education. [passage omitted]. 
  [Begin recording] [Emmanuel Constant, in Creole] We are 
asking that all the current ministers of Malval's resigning 
government stop going to work, as the parliament directed. We 
are very serious about this. We are asking all the ministers not 
to go to work on 28 March. 
  [Louis Jodel Chambelin] If they do not obey, the Haitian 
people will come and remove them. And I hope that the next 
government arrests all the directors general and the ministers, 
so they can explain what they did with the Haitian people's 
money [applause] [end recording] 
  Those were FRAPH leaders Emmanuel Constant and Louis Jodel 
Chambelain.

  [Excerpts] Charge d'Affaires Philippe Seltz is very 
confident about unloading 530 tons of food products. He went to 
the Haitian parliament on 24 March to dispel any of the 
deputies' suspicions about the quality of the food products 
which will be distributed to 50,000 children. The following is a 
report by Daly Valet. 
  [Begin recording] [Valet] "During this meeting with the 
deputies, French Charge Philippe Seltz guaranteed that the food 
products that will be transported by the French ship will meet 
all humanitarian and sanitary regulations. 
Seltz said he hopes the ship will be able to unload at the 
Port-au-Prince wharf because, in his opinion, the French 
Government wants to help the Haitian people through the crisis 
they have been experiencing since 30 September 1991." 
  [Seltz] I spoke with the president of the Chamber of 
Deputies 
and several parliamentarians. We exchanged general views on 
questions regarding, among other things, this ship. Obviously, I 
hope that there will be no problem relating to its arrival. 
  [Unidentified journalist] Nevertheless, the ship will arrive 
and will also be unloaded? 
  [Seltz] I hope so. 
  [Valet] "Seltz also discussed political issues with the 
deputies. Concerning the parliamentary plan that was passed by 
the Chamber of Deputies, the French diplomat did not say whether 
the French Government supports the plan or not. He just said 
that the French Government remains committed to the Governors 
Island agreement. According to him, all points in this agreement 
must be respected." 
  [Seltz] ...the traditional position of France and the rest 
of 
the international community. 
  [Journalist] What is it? What position? 
  [Seltz] The implementation of all points of the Governors 
Island agreement and the New York pact. 
  [Journalist] You are against this plan? Are you against the 
plan of the parliamentarians? 
  [Seltz] No, I have not said that at all. I tell you that I 
favor the implementation [pauses] that France favors the 
implementation of all the points of the Governors Island 
agreement just like other countries have always said. 
  [Journalist] How do you interpret the American's position? 
  [Seltz] The same way. 
  [Journalist] And the Americans' position on the 
parliamentarians' plan? 
  [Seltz] That can be a first step. 
  [Journalist] Toward what? 
  [Seltz] Toward the implementation of the Governors Island 
agreement. [passage omitted] 
  [Valet] "Seltz visited the Chamber of Deputies diplomatic 
lounge to explain about the French ship's arrival in Haiti, the 
ship that is carrying humanitarian aid. Remember that Chamber of 
Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde has already come out 
against the arrival of this ship. According to the deputy, 
France is a hypocrite, a deceiver. Daly Valet for Signal FM."

  [Text] Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] sources have 
revealed with the assistance of the National Civilian Police 
[PNC], the Usulutan Departmental Electoral Board was able to 
recover the Jucuapa ballot boxes which party poll 
representatives were retaining. 
  Riot agents entered the "Saul Flores" Coed Urban School 
where 
members of the municipal electoral board were holding the boxes. 
  Reports have indicated militants of the Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front, Unity Movement, and Democratic 
Convergence have tried to keep the boxes from the PNC members, 
who succeeded in their objective without any major incidents. 
  Representatives of the above parties did not allow TSE 
delegates to remove the ballot boxes on 20 March, claiming 
"fraud" was committed in the elections and that they should have 
been held in Jucuapa. 
  The disgruntled party representatives warned if the TSE does 
not cancel the Jucuapa elections, the political parties that 
participated in the elections in that region "will adopt a 
municipal government elected by consensus." 
  TSE Magistrate Dr. Jaime Romero Ventura has told EL DIARIO 
DE 
HOY "today (yesterday) at 0800 in the morning, all the voting 
material from Jucuapa reached the TSE." 
  Romero added "because the vote counting could not take place 
in Jucuapa, they are doing it here in the hotel (Presidente)... 
but all (the information from) from Usulutan Department is 
indeed at TSE installations."

<F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] A group of Democrats in the U.S. House of 
Representatives who observed the elections in El Salvador today 
called for the retention of U.S. economic aid until anomalies in 
the voters' registration lists are overcome. 
  Representatives from New York, Illinois, and California 
reported in the United States that they witnessed the courage 
and perseverance of Salvadorans, as well as widespread confusion 
and irregularities in the elections. The observers' spokesman 
said that the problems in electoral registries must be corrected 
by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] so that the run-off 
election, scheduled for 24 April, can be clean and credible. In 
addition, the group asked that the United States link the 
delivery of $55 million in economic aid to the correction of 
errors detected in the electoral registries. 
  Such a request prompted diverse reactions among the 
presidential candidates who headed Sunday's election results: 
Armando Calderon Sol noted that the request lacks any basis. 
Meanwhile, Ruben Zamora said that it was a normal reaction in 
view of the expectations placed on the electoral process. 
  The discontent of certain U.S. legislators, who observed the 
number of errors that marred Sunday's elections, became evident 
today, when they asked that the economic aid to El Salvador be 
retained until the anomalies in the electoral registry are 
corrected. 
  The presidential candidates interpreted this petition 
differently: 
  [Begin recording] [Zamora] Everyone was told that this was 
the election of the century, and yet, 47 percent of the people 
could not vote. Locally, this was frustrating to many people. 
But, internationally, it was also disappointing for many people 
and thus, they are reacting. 
  [Calderon Sol] I think that this lacks any basis. I do not 
know the gentlemen who made this request, but when they hear 
what the United Nations and the international community said, I 
think they will change their minds completely. [end recording] 
  The two candidates met with TSE magistrates on Wednesday. At 
the meeting they explained their points of view with regard to 
Sunday's elections and their proposals for the correction of 
irregularities to speed up the final count. 
  [Begin recording] [Zamora] There are problems that, 
obviously, cannot be solved in one month, such as the 
approximately 300,000 people without voter registration cards. 
However, we can again begin a period to issue cards. But there 
is also the problem of what to do so people can find their names 
on the lists. [end recording] 
  [Calderon Sol] I think that we should be pleased that the 
TSE 
has taken the attitude of welcoming our help and to show a will 
to overcome the problems. [end recording] 
  The candidates trust that the TSE will correct the mistakes 
made on Sunday so that the run-off election can be carried out 
normally. They also suggested that a new period to obtain 
voters' registration cards be established.

  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas State, 27 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- 
Chiapas State Governor Javier Lopez Moreno has denied the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army's (EZLN) "state of alert" is 
disrupting the peace process in the region. In remarks to the 
local press, he added the state government, which he heads, and 
the federal government will continue their steadfast efforts to 
promote and reach peace. 
  The EZLN, the governor has said, has respected the 
cease-fire. Bishop Manuel Ruiz, mediator of the Chiapas 
conflict, said on 26 March in San Cristobal de las Casas, the 
site of the peace talks between the EZLN and the federal 
government, the Zapatists' decision to halt the consultations 
and declare a state of alert responds to the country's 
prevailing situation. He added the date for the second peace 
talks has not been set yet. 
  The Zapatists, according to the communique issued 25 March 
and carried by the local and foreign media, came in the wake of 
the murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate of 
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, on 23 March.

<F P=106> ["Special news bulletin" by Juan Carlos Antollo] </F>
  [Text] Today peace mediator Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San 
Cristobal de las Casas, reacted to the latest events in Mexico. 
He read a communique which states: 
  Regarding the assessment of the situation outlined in the 
10-point communique issued by the EZLN (Zapatist National 
Liberation Army] on 24 March 1994, I consider it appropriate to 
present the mediator's views on the communique. 
  1. We understand the EZLN communique does not announce a 
break in the peace talks or an end to the cease-fire. On the 
contrary, the EZLN expressed its determination to maintain the 
cease-fire in keeping with its communique dated 12 January 1994. 
  2. We do not view the contents of the EZLN communique as 
a break in the dialogue but, rather, as a notification of an 
interruption in the consultation process, the second stage of 
which was to be held in the jungle. Regarding the text of the 
government's commitments and the next step for the dialogue, a 
path toward peace must be sought. 
  3. While denouncing hostile actions, which indeed could 
become possible in the wake of the grave attack on Luis Donaldo 
Colosio Murrieta, the EZLN made public its determination to 
declare a state of maximum alert in light of a possible 
confrontation. 
  [Begin Ruiz recording] After stating these points, we 
believe 
it is necessary to make a general appeal, considering the 
gravity of the situation, in order not to block those avenues 
leading toward peace. The exceptional circumstances we are 
experiencing demand we all seek the truth to guide our freedom 
[as heard]. 
  False or distorted reports, ill-intentioned rumors, and 
slanderous attacks weaken the foundations of an atmosphere of 
understanding and good faith which is indispensable to 
engendering the birth of the new country we all desire. [end 
recording] 
  Bishop Samuel Ruiz made the aforementioned clarification 
because here in San Cristobal there are rumors that attacks are 
under way in various areas of Chiapas. These rumors were 
immediately denied, particularly after confirmation was sought 
in Ocosingo. 
  The San Cristobal bishop called on the media to act 
responsibly, because some media sources have reported unfounded 
rumors that have lead nowhere. 
  [Begin Ruiz recording] We all trust that the in-depth 
investigation regarding the events leading to the assassination 
of Luis Donaldo Colosio be objective, persuasive, and in 
accordance with the law. We hope that this will not become a 
pretext that might enable military thinking and its high social 
and human costs to once again prevail over rational dialogue and 
political negotiations. [end recording] 
  In the end, Samuel Ruiz said that at this time, society, 
social organizations, and mediation efforts must serve the path 
of peace and dialogue, adding that these efforts should again be 
reaffirmed and redirected toward their proper ends. He 
concluded that at this point in time, there is indeed a state of 
alert, but that this could be terminated quickly if we can hold 
a new dialogue to attain a long-awaited peace in Chiapas.

  [Text] Mexico City, 26 Mar (EFE) -- Manuel Camacho Solis, 
the commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, 
reported in a press release today, Saturday, that the Mexican 
Government and Army support the political negotiations and the 
peace process in resolving the armed conflict. 
  Camacho replied to charges made by the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army (EZLN) that the government was preparing an 
imminent attack against EZLN positions and had bombed an area 
close to the southern city of Comitan, approximately 1,200 km 
from Mexico City. 
  Camacho said he had sent a confidential communique to the 
EZLN on its main military concerns to clarify the current 
situation in the Chiapas conflict zone. 
  The peace commissioner asserted that despite the tense 
situation in Chiapas over the past weeks, both the Mexican Army 
and the EZLN had respected the truce and had complied with the 
agreed upon cease-fire. 
  The document signed by Manuel Camacho stated: "The dialogue 
and political negotiations halted the war and opened 
possibilities for an agreement, and this continues to be the 
only way to find a dignified peace in Chiapas." 
  The murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential 
candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI), 
prompted a situation of political uncertainty regarding the 
peace process and presidential succession. The EZLN said the 
PRI candidate's murder was a cowardly act and announced that its 
forces would be on red alert to counter an imminent attack from 
government forces, which it accused of increasing their military 
presence and preparing a military offensive. 
  The Zapatists accused the hard-line sectors and supporters 
of 
the military for the bloodshed in the country, Colosio's murder, 
and attempts to annul all peaceful efforts to democratize Mexico.

Subcommander Marcos from the "mountains of southeastern Mexico" 
on 24 March; all uppercase words in postscript published in

  [Text] To the national weekly PROCESO; to the national 
newspaper LA JORNADA; to the national newspaper EL FINANCIERO; 
to the local SCLC [San Cristobal de las Casas] newspaper TIEMPO; 
to the national and international press: 
  24 March 1994 
  Gentlemen: They... Why did they have to do this? Whom are 
they punishing with this attack? If they are trying to justify 
military action against us or against our flag, would it not 
have been better for them to have killed one of us? In this 
way, the country would have bled less than with this infamy we 
are now enduring. Did this man hurt anyone? Who was frightened 
by his dissension from the very group that attempted to keep 
itself in power through him? Who has gained by the shedding of 
his blood? Where were those who protected him? Who was the 
benefactor of that "pacifist" whose hand once again opened the 
heavy door of war? Does this make sense? Is it logical to 
blame the crime on peace in order to deny the possibility of 
peace? What will come next? How many more assassinations will 
follow before we can establish democracy, freedom, and justice? 
  We clearly understand the message this crime writes across 
the sky of the nation. Is it necessary for us to spill more of 
our blood? Well... we knew it, but he did not. Come. We are 
here, where we were born and where we grew up, where we have the 
great heart that supports us, where history and our dead reside. 
We are out here, in the mountains of southeastern Mexico... 
come and get us... we know how to greet each one of you and 
grant you your just desserts... both good and evil... 
  Beware. Nothing is safe anymore, much less the hope for 
peace. Okay. 
  From the mountains of southeastern Mexico 
  [Signed] Insurgent Subcommander Marcos 
  P.S. -- FOR THOSE NO ONE SEES 
  Greetings, fellow Zapatist moles [topos]. We have sparkled 
thanks to your patient and clandestine work. The black night of 
infamy is upon us once again. The end of our era is coming. We 
promise to shine brightly until we outshine the sun before 
vanishing into thin air. Until the last hour we will embrace 
the clandestine side that supported our gleaming INTERIOR light 
that filtered through us to radiate this bit of history. We are 
at the front, like those who came before us. We will honor the 
dignity of our dead... Brethren moles, we are nearing the end of 
our path... It will then be your turn, dear moles. Do not 
forget what is represented by the steps we have taken. We were 
sincere in determining whether another door would open to our 
dim light. We must now learn a lesson from this lamentable 
tale. Never forget the word that made us great, even if it was 
only for a moment: ALL FOR ALL, NOTHING FOR US. Goodbye armed 
moles; have your flag ready and prepare yourselves and those who 
shall follow you. It is now your turn to cover your faces, 
erase your names, renege from your past, prepare your tender 
fury, and prepare your weapons, because peace is vanishing as 
rapidly as it came. Permit us, my faraway moles, as one final 
salute, to send you our left hand on the temple and also... [as 
published] 
  A GIFT AND A POLITICAL CLASS 
  A section of the moon... /but in reality it is not one/ but 
two sections:/ the section of the dark side of the moon/ and the 
section of the bright side of the moon. /And here, what one must 
understand/ is that the section of the moon that shines /does so 
because there is a dark side./ It is the dark side of the moon 
/that makes the bright side/ of the moon possible. The same 
holds true for us. /If we are to become the dark side of the 
moon/ it does not mean that we have been cheapened /but that we 
are ready/ to be the dark side /which makes it possible for all 
to see the moon/ (and in the end, /the dark side is more 
valuable/ because it shines for other eras /and because to see 
it/ one must learn to fly at extreme heights). 
  Moreover, this is how /there can be a few people prepared/ 
to 
suffer so that others do not suffer /and to die/ in order that 
others may live, and this is so /because of boots [botas], moon, 
etc./ period. [sentence as published] 
  Okay, my venerable moles, we shall meet again under the 
earth... 
  [Signed] Subcommander Marcos

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Manuel Alvarado] </F>
  [Text] Lacandona Jungle, (APRO) [expansion unknown] -- 
Subcommander Marcos, spokesperson for the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army [EZLN], said that the only ones to gain from the 
murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio [Mexican Institutional 
Revolutionay Party, PRI, presidential candidate] are those 
pressure groups that are opposed to peace. Monsignor Samuel 
Ruiz, the bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, warned of the 
danger of destabilization. 
  In an interview on the night of 23 March on the outskirts of 
a town in the Lacandona Jungle, Marcos said that "at the 
beginning Colosio was a sure thing to be elected for Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari's position. However, he began to change his 
discourse and his line of action. The ruling pressure groups who 
have always opposed the peace talks in Chiapas are the ones who 
gain from this action. The EZLN loses, mediator Samuel Ruiz 
loses, and peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis loses." 
  He explained that the country now faces a crisis, not only 
within the PRI campaign but also within all the other parties, 
which will now have to redefine their strategies. Marcos said 
the upcoming political changes were the result of the 1 January 
armed uprising. He said the Colosio he saw on the campaign trail 
was always wise in addressing the EZLN. "He never spoke of us as 
criminals. As I see it, he had begun to steer away from the 
Salinas strategies. He was trying to draft his own ideas and to 
recognize that there are in fact very deep social problems. The 
Zapatists had seen the face of Salinas de Gortari in the PRI 
presidential candidate -- the same economic plan with the same 
political ties and similar social cost," Marcos said. "But he 
had tried to change that. We do not know what will happen now 
that he has died."

  [Text] Mario Aburto Martinez, who assassinated Luis Donaldo 
Colosio Murrieta, had maintained ties with several armed groups 
in various Mexican states, according to his testimony before the 
attorney general moments after murdering the PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] candidate. Aburto refused, however, to 
name the armed groups and the regions in which they operate or 
to say whether he acted alone or if the assassination was part 
of a plot. He also denied belonging in the past or at present to 
any political party or religious sect.

<F P=106> [Report by Francisco Mendoza from Tijuana, Baja California; </F>
from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] 
  [Text] The possibility that more than one person took part 
in the attack against Luis Donaldo Colosio was strongly 
suggested today by Jose Luis Perez Canchola, the Baja California 
human rights attorney general, who was present when Mario Aburto 
Martinez was interrogated for approximately two hours. 
  The local ZETA weekly magazine has reported that the FBI 
believes that Aburto could be part of a left-wing political 
group. The publication added that someone had shouted "kill 
him!" just seconds before the first shot rang out. If this is 
true, it confirms Perez Canchola's statements that another 
person was in on the crime and was at the site of the 
assassination. 
  The Attorney General's Office has confirmed that the DEA and 
FBI are helping with the criminal investigation and have started 
to check on several of Aburto's relatives in California. I will 
now play the tape [previous word in English] with Perez 
Canchola's statements. Here it is: 
  [Begin recording] [Perez] We were all present and heard this 
man's statements [words indistinct] so calmly and with an 
complete control of his nerves. He spoke with a firm voice when 
he answered [words indistinct]. Furthermore, he was extremely 
adamant in his refusal to answer most of the questions that were 
asked. 
  Because of the gravity of this event, the strong supposition 
has emerged that this was an act organized by more than one 
person. It would have taken a very extraordinary person to 
carry out this action single-handedly. It had to be carried out 
by someone with a great deal of education and training, as he 
himself has stated. 
  It is evident from his statements that he organized the act. 
He bought a weapon with which, over a period of time, he 
conducted target practice in a field -- a field he did not 
identify in his testimony. He specifically told us that his 
intention was to wound candidate Colosio to call the media's 
attention to pacifism and to enable him to talk publicly about 
pacifism. [words indistinct] his statements. He said that 
after being pushed and in the process of [words indistinct]. 
You [reporters] were there and know what happened, right? 
  I must say that while giving general facts and other scant 
details about this action, he answered with a great deal of 
serenity. He was asked about the possibility of being part of a 
group, and he was questioned on his preparations in carrying out 
this action. He refused to reply to any of these questions. 
[words indistinct] but he always refused to reply. He even 
refused to sign the testimony documents. 
  I have to say that I only saw him appear nervous once. I 
noticed this because I saw his eyes widen and look incredulously 
at the person. This was when they informed him that candidate 
Colosio had died. He started to mumble something, but he fell 
silent and immediately resumed his position of refusing to 
answer any question. 
  This is what I perceived about him. He is a young person, 23 
years old, who has the apperance of a worker. He showed a great 
deal of self-confidence during the entire time I was with him. 
To have done what he did, it seems to me that any person would 
show signs of anxiety, but he was extremely calm. I saw him 
walk briskly from one office to another. It appears he prepared 
himself psychologically for some time to do what he did. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Why do you think he acted like this? 
Do you think he is aligned with an organization or that he acted 
with a friend or was encouraged by someone else? 
  [Perez] I agreed to talk to you only about what I saw at the 
meeting [words indistinct] the rest is speculation. I have only 
dared think... [pauses] the magnitude of this criminal act and 
his conduct have led me to believe that more than one person was 
involved. [end recording]

  [Text] Mexico City, 26 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Police in Mexico 
today denied reports that the person presented to the media as 
the alleged killer of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo 
Colosio is not the same individual originally arrested. 
  Attorney General Diego Valadez Rios said in a news release 
that the person being held, Mario Aburto Martinez, 23, 
"authorized" prison officials to shave off his moustache, which 
he was wearing in the first photographs that were released. 
  The attorney general, who is in charge of prosecuting 
federal 
offenses, stressed: "Let there be no impression that there has 
been any kind of switch or some sort of cover-up." 
  Privately owned television stations have broadcast footage 
of 
Aburto's arrest. At the time of his arrest, just after he had 
shot Colosio, presidential candidate for the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI), he was wearing a moustache. 
  On Friday, authorities presented an individual to the media 
they identified as Aburto. The man was behind bullet-proof 
glass at the Almoloya High Security Prison in Juarez, Mexico 
State, close to the Mexican capital. 
  The murder occurred just as Colosio was leaving a campaign 
rally in the northwestern city of Tijuana, Baja California, near 
the U.S. border. 
  Valadez said the investigations into the Colosio murder were 
being handled with the utmost clarity, honesty, seriousness, 
impartiality, and respect for the law and the press to maintain 
public trust in the law enforcement institutions. 
  Fingerprint records and all of the material regarding the 
investigation have been made available to the proper authorities 
and to the press to avoid speculation. 
  A second person, Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, was arrested in 
connection with the incident, but he was released later. 
  Valadez said that the suspect made his initial statement 
yesterday before the Mexico State First District Judge, during 
which he reaffirmed his original confession. 
  He added that there has been significant progress regarding 
information about the suspect's rearing and current lifestyle. 
Valadez reported that investigators have interviewed Aburto's 
family and other witnesses, and he denied that there is any 
other person in custody.

  [Text] Newspapers are insisting there are still many holes 
in the investigation into Luis Donaldo Colosio's slaying. It 
has been said that two men may have killed Colosio. The bullets 
that killed PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential 
candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio may have been fired by two 
attackers, Mario Aburto Martinez and Jose Antonio Sanchez 
Ortega, because paraffin tests conducted on both men turned out 
positive. Tijuana Judicial Police Commander Jorge Alvarez 
Barrieri made this announcement. 
  However, the Attorney General's Office has stated that Mario 
Aburto Martinez is the only assassin and that he has confessed 
to firing two shots. The press also reported that 17 people at 
one time or another had owned the gun with which Colosio was 
killed on the tragic evening of 23 March in Tijuana, Baja 
California. 
  There has also been speculation about statements made by 
Mario Aburto Martinez after he was arrested following Colosio's 
killing. According to Jose Luis Perez Canchola, Baja California 
human rights ombudsman who was present during the questioning, 
it is very unlikely the killer acted alone. It was also said 
that Mario Aburto Martinez is refusing to answer questions 
concerning which armed groups he may have belonged to, or 
whether he acted alone or whether the attack was part of a 
conspiracy. 
  I must remind listeners that these are not official 
statements by the Attorney General's Office. I am just 
reporting what has been said aside from official statements from 
the Attorney General's Office. 
  It has been reported that Mario Aburto Martinez said in his 
deposition that he purchased the .38-caliber gun in California 
to injure Luis Donaldo Colosio, to attract the media's 
attention, and to explain his pacifist ideas before the national 
and international press, as well as to disclose information he 
has on armed groups in different areas of Mexico. None of the 
aforementioned statements is official. 
  It was also mentioned that Mario Aburto Martinez may have 
belonged to a political group. His girlfriend said he spent 
four weeks in Chiapas. It was also confirmed that he was 
influenced by the sect known as the Jehovah's Witnesses. It has 
also been learned that residents of Zamora, Michoacan, have been 
angered by this situation, because Zamora, Michoacan, is the 
hometown of Mario Aburto Martinez, who has confessed to having 
fired on and killing Luis Donaldo Colosio.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Armenta] </F>
  [Text] [Armenta] The Congressional Permanent Commission 
opened a special meeting at 2330 today. 
  [Announcer] It started late, right? 
  [Armenta] Yes, the meeting started 30 minutes behind 
schedule. The legislators are currently debating whether to give 
Supreme Court Justice Miguel Montes a temporary authority to 
conduct an investigation that will clarify Luis Donaldo 
Colosio's murder. A few minutes ago, PRD [Party of the 
Democratic Revolution] Senator Porfirio Munoz Ledo said his 
party will vote against appointing Miguel Montes as special 
deputy prosecutor in the Colosio murder case, because his 
appointment was made unilaterally and because it does not 
guarantee an impartial investigation. 
  [Begin Munoz recording] We do not believe a decision such as 
the one presented today before the Permanent Commission will 
favor the clarification of this case, and it is even less likely 
to satisfy the desire of Mexican citizens, political forces, and 
the entire country to have clear, honest, and truthful 
proceedings. Therefore, we will openly vote against this 
proposal. [end recording] 
  Nevertheless, PAN [National Action Party] and PRI 
[Institutional Revolutionary Party] legislators have announced 
that they will vote in favor of Miguel Montes' appointment, 
because the country urgently needs to clarify Luis Donaldo 
Colosio's murder and Justice Montes has shown professional 
proficiency in this area. 
  The Permanent Commission will also discuss and, perhaps 
approve, the appointments of Miguel Mancera Aguayo as governor 
of the Banco de Mexico board and Guillermo Prieto Fortun, Ariel 
Buira Siera, Jesus Marco Jacaman, and Francisco Gil Diaz as 
deputy governors. 
  [Announcer] Jose Luis, it had been constantly rumored that 
this special meeting could also call a special session of 
Congress to modify the Article 72, Paragraph 6 of the 
Constitution. This is the section that includes requirements 
for running for public office. For example, state secretaries 
who want to run for a federal post currently must resign six 
months before Election Day. If this section is reformed, it 
would allow cabinet members to be considered in the selection 
process for a candidate to replace Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
However, this issue will not be discussed, right? 
  [Armenta] No, the issue will not be discussed at this 
meeting. This rumor started yesterday when Maria de los Angeles 
Moreno, the president of the Permanent Commission, called for a 
special meeting but did not specify the meeting's agenda. The 
points to be debated at this special meeting were not revealed 
until today.

<F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz] </F>
  [Text] Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo McGregor said at 
noon today that Luis Donaldo Colosio's assassination must not, 
indeed cannot, inhibit the Mexican people's resolve to express 
their sovereign will in the upcoming elections. He gave 
assurances that the electoral process will continue under the 
guiding principles of legality, impartiality, security, and 
objectivity. This important statement to the news media, 
especially after the tragic events we have experienced, means 
that the people who are in charge of domestic policy are 
ensuring stability and that the conditions are given to continue 
the electoral process leading up to the election of the 
Republic's next president and congress. 
  Dr. Carpizo urged the political parties to assume the pledge 
the moment demands. He said that according to the law problems 
should not lead to undesirable confrontations, the results of 
which affect everyone. Differences should be settled through 
dialogue and reason and within the framework of the law. Dr. 
Carpizo explained that the Mexican people are opposed to 
impunity and are demanding justice and security. 
  [Begin Carpizo recording] Let us close a tragic page of our 
history and cling to the hope of a better fatherland, one that 
is firm in its convictions and zealous about its pledge of 
loyalty to the most noble human ideals. The time has come to 
prove that Mexico's values are firm, that it possesses the 
necessary maturity to function cohesively and with absolute 
respect for the law, and that it can behave in a manner that is 
consistent with its convictions concerning the preservation of 
peace and the democratic institutions that guarantee our social 
coexistence. All of this, of course, within the de jure state 
that governs us. [end recording] 
  Mexico, Dr. Carpizo added, is a strong country and will 
unquestionably emerge from this tragedy as a stronger country. 
  I also spoke with Federal District Attorney General Diego 
Valades, who held a private meeting with Government Secretary 
Carpizo. During an interview this afternoon, Valades told us 
that the authorities will take all the time that is necessary to 
resolve Colosio's assassination. He added that there is no 
threat of instability in Mexico. 
  [Begin Valades recording] The country is lining up and ought 
to line up behind a progressive awareness of unity. Moreover, 
and this is very important, we Mexicans should have confidence 
in ourselves. The tragic and regrettable events you referred to 
have certainly been a source of worry for the community, but we 
Mexicans should not lose our self-esteem. That would be the 
worst thing for us to lose. [end recording] 
  Valades concluded that at 1700 this afternoon the Attorney 
General's Office will release a statement on the progress that 
has been made in the investigation of the assassination.

<F P=106> [Report by Ricardo Aleman Aleman and Oscar Camacho Guzman] </F>
  [Text] The PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] should 
choose its new presidential candidate by Sunday at the latest, 
according to sources of the PRI National Executive Committee. 
Inside the party the names mentioned as possible successors for 
Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta are Fernando Ortiz Arana, Ernesto 
Zedillo Ponce de Leon, Fernando Gutierrez Barrios or 
"possibility another former governor." 
  The same sources recognized that the two days of national 
mourning -- Thursday and Friday -- in memory of the former PRI 
presidential candidate "in addition to being justified, served 
the federal government by giving it time to maneuver in the face 
of a possible destabilization of the financial markets." 
  The PRI has not decided yet how the new presidential 
candidate will be chosen, but "it is clear" that the decision 
will not be prolonged past this coming Sunday. The reason for 
this is that both the PRI and the government would be running a 
big risk if they do not contain as soon as possible the emotions 
unleashed by the assassination of Colosio Murrieta. The 
credibility of the PRI ranking leadership could be undermined, 
and there should be security in the economic sphere to avert a 
financial disaster. 
  In the meantime, in the Chamber of Deputies a general 
comment 
heard among legislators and leaders was that following the 
assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio serious tensions have 
arisen between the federal government and old PRI members, some 
of whom belong to the National Political Council. Several 
leaders said the reason is because in the PRI political ranks 
they are demanding that it not be the president, as the foremost 
PRI leader, who chooses the new candidate. They are demanding 
this to avoid "an erroneous decision," which might cause more 
friction and internal breaks. The stalwart PRI political class 
demands a part in the designation of the new candidate. 
  Senator Humberto Lugo Gil spoke yesterday about the 
mechanisms that would have to be followed. He contends that the 
new election should be carried out in keeping with the statutes. 
It would require that the National Executive Committee convoke 
the Political Council in order to issue a call for the 
registration of candidates. The senator for Hidalgo denied that 
the announcement would be made in a surprise manner between 
Thursday and Friday night. He said that the period of national 
mourning should be observed first out of respect for the memory 
of Colosio. 
  According to the sources of the Executive Committee, the PRI 
machinery will be in motion again tonight, once the leadership 
sectors have attended the funeral for Luis Donaldo Colosio 
Murrieta in his native hometown of Magdalena de Kino, Sonora. In 
other words, they will conduct a meeting of the Political 
Council, which would have to meet on Saturday to announce a call 
for the registration of presidential hopefuls, if the tradition 
is to be followed. Otherwise, according to its statutes, the 
council is empowered to designate a presidential candidate, 
  At the same time, results were obtained of an assessment 
made 
among PRI deputies regarding the possibility of resorting to 
constitutional reforms to give the PRI a broader margin of 
maneuver in view of the situation surrounding the wake for Luis 
Donaldo Colosio Murrieta. 
  For the time being, the PRI has ruled out "forcing the 
Constitution" and promoting amendments to eliminate the 
requisite established in Article 82 of the Constitution that 
persons who aspire to being presidential candidates must resign 
six months before the elections. 
  It was also considered unadvisable to change the date of 
the scheduled 21 August elections. In this respect, Maria de 
los Angeles Moreno, president of the Grand Commission of the 
Chamber of Deputies, said in an interview that the elections 
"should be held on the date established by law." 
  The PRI legislator appealed "for calm, peace, prudence, and 
unity, because times of crisis and confusion are when we most 
need prudence and when we must rally around the president of the 
republic." 
  Regarding the presidential hopefuls within the PRI, Fernando 
Ortiz Arana has a good chance, because he would represent a 
unifying force among those groups that voiced opposition to the 
presidential candidacy. He is considered to be one of the most 
politically experienced politicians, but he is also criticized 
for lacking experience as a businessman and because he has no 
connections to the financial and economic communities. 
  Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon is said to be the "natural 
replacement" for Colosio. In fact, as a coordinator of past PRI 
political campaigns, the party's unwritten rules would naturally 
tend to select him to replace Colosio. Important factions 
within the PRI, however, believe "he has not matured" and that 
his nomination "might signify maintaining the status quo of the 
political system." 
  Regarding Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, former Veracruz 
governor and former government secretary, there are those who 
believe he could play a decisive role in enforcing internal 
party discipline and, above all else, in overcoming the 
nationwide unrest that is following in the wake the Indian armed 
uprising, the kidnapping of Alfredo Harp Helu, and the 
assassination of Colosio Murrieta.

<F P=106> ["Special report" by the Radio ACIR Network News Department] </F>
  [Text] [Station announcer] Since early this morning at the 
headquarters of the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], 
there has been considerable activity among members of the 
National Executive Committee. At noon, Fernando Ortiz Arana, 
president of the National Executive Committee of the PRI, 
arrived at PRI headquarters after spending most of the morning 
at the Los Pinos Presidential Residence. 
  Again, I want to stress that there is a great deal of 
activity at PRI headquarters. Let us go now to PRI 
headquarters, where we have Rosie Ahuactzin Vasquez standing by. 
Rosie, good afternoon. 
  [Ahuactzin] Thank you, and good afternoon to you. Given the 
anxiety here at PRI headquarters, Fernando Ortiz Arana, 
president of the PRI National Executive Committee, has issued a 
news release. This news release says: The PRI continues to 
remain loyal to the democratic and libertarian ideology endorsed 
by the party, as well as to remain loyal to President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari, who serves as the guardian of the nation's 
faith, justice, and the de jure state. 
  Fernando Ortiz Arana said the PRI National Executive 
Committee has disavowed -- and this should be stressed -- any 
expression of support in favor of any candidate until the PRI 
establishes the internal procedures for conducting this 
unprecedented process. 
  For the PRI, as well as for all of Mexico, the president of 
the PRI National Executive Committee added that these days are a 
time of mourning and reflection, and, therefore, in due time an 
internal process based on the party's bylaws will be initiated 
to select the new candidate. 
  Ortiz Arana also stressed that the party remains united 
behind the ideological and political program proposed by Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, because his colors were the same as those of 
the PRI. Fernando Ortiz Arana reiterated that on behalf of the 
PRI National Executive Committee, no member or official of the 
party is authorized to make statements on the election of 
possible presidential candidates. He expressed this process 
must conform to existing bylaws. 
  This is what the news release issued by the PRI said. In 
short, it indicates that we will have to wait a little longer 
before a new presidential candidate is selected. I must repeat, 
however, there is a great deal of activity within the PRI 
offices. There are even three mobile television units here. 
There are also a large number of foreign reporters and, of 
course, domestic journalists. 
  [Station announcer] Could you please repeat the basic points 
of this news release just issued by Fernando Ortiz Arana, 
president of the PRI National Executive Committee, warning PRI 
forces and leaders not to publicly endorse any individual? The 
news release also said the PRI National Executive Committee, in 
keeping with the party's statutes, will in due time report the 
name of the candidate who will replace Luis Donaldo Colosio on 
the PRI ticket, correct? 
  [Ahuactzin] Fernando Ortiz Arana's news release says we are 
in a time of mourning; at least nine days of mourning will be 
observed. He said the party disavows any expression of support 
in favor of any individual until the PRI, in accordance with its 
bylaws, establishes the procedure for conducting this internal 
process, which is unprecedented. He also spoke of the need to 
maintain loyalty toward the democratic and libertarian ideology 
of the party, as well as to remain loyal to President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari. 
  Not long ago here in the press room, a news conference was 
held by the so-called Democracy 2000 group, which reiterated its 
support for Luis Donaldo Colosio to be replaced by Fernando 
Ortiz Arana. The news release indicates Fernando Ortiz Arana is 
very upset with this news conference by Democracy 2000. He said 
this group's position has been renounced, adding that no 
endorsement should be made until the members of the Political 
Council meet to determine the process for selecting the new 
candidate. 
  In addition, Mario Moya Palencia, who was appointed 
secretary 
of the PRI Ideology Commission by Luis Donaldo Colosio, has 
stated that the party is in no hurry to select a new 
presidential candidate. He explained that everything must be 
done in accordance with the party's statutes and within the 
framework of the law in an effort to avoid divisions within the 
party.

  [Editorial Report] Monterrey EL NORTE (Foreign Edition) in 
Spanish on page 16A of its 25 March edition carries a 300-word 
item highlighting the results of a survey on people's views in 
the wake of the 23 March assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, 
presidential candidate for the Mexican Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI). 
  The item, published under the heading "Opinion Concerning 
the 
Attack," comprises four pie charts and four graphs that show the 
results of the survey, which questioned an unidentified number 
of Monterrey and Mexico City citizens on issues ranging from the 
possibility of rescheduling the presidential elections to who 
should replace Colosio on the PRI presidential ticket. 
  Most citizens polled in Monterrey and Mexico City believe 
that the date for the scheduled 21 August elections should not 
be changed and that there likely is a covert mastermind behind 
the crime. Of the citizens polled in Mexico City, 54 percent 
responded by saying the date of the elections should not be 
changed, while 51 percent of Monterrey citizens opposed changing 
the date of the elections. Of those polled in Mexico City, some 
15 percent believe opposition parties are behind Colosio's 
killing, followed by fellow PRI members (11 percent); Manuel 
Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in 
Chiapas (9 percent); the government (9 percent); Party of the 
Democratic Revolution candidate Cuahutemoc Cardenas (3 percent); 
the Zapatist National Liberation Army (1 percent); drug 
traffickers (1 percent); and foreigners (1 percent). Also, 39 
percent of those polled in both Mexico City and Monterrey said 
they believe the motive behind the killing was political. 
  Meanwhile, 20 percent of those polled in Mexico City said 
the 
killing will bring about more violence and will destabilize the 
country. Regarding people's preferences to replace Colosio, 36 
percent of those polled in Mexico City said they favor Manuel 
Camacho Solis, who was followed by Pedro Aspe Armella (4 
percent), Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon (6 percent), Fernando 
Ortiz Arana (5 percent), Jaime Serra Puche (2 percent), Jorge 
Carpizo (6 percent), and Fernando Gutierrez Barrios (2 percent).

  [Text] Mexico City, 26 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Mexico City Mayor 
Manuel Aguilera Gomez today announced that additional steps are 
being taken to bolster security for presidential candidates 
while they campaign in the capital. The additional measures are 
designed to help guarantee the candidates' personal safety. 
  "There will be more (police) units at the political events 
they (the candidates) attend," Aguilera told reporters. "Some 
have accepted this, but others, such as Diego Fernandez de 
Cevallos, the presidential candidate of the conservative 
National Action Party, oppose the move. I believe it would be 
desirable if they all would agree to accept the additional 
security." 
  The move was ordered in the wake of the assassination of 
Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate of the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI) who was killed at a political event in 
Tijuana in northern Mexico on Wednesday. All eight opposition 
candidates participating in the presidential elections scheduled 
for 21 August have condemned Colosio's murder.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Armenta; from the "ACIR Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Today Gonzalo Altamirano Dimas, National Action 
Party [PAN] deputy and president of this political institution 
in the Federal District, said no one should bet on the worsening 
of economic and political problems. He pointed out that even 
though the Mexican Stock Market has seen a decrease in the 
number of transactions, this is a natural phenomenon because of 
the recent assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, PRI, presidential candidate]. In an 
interview, Gonzalo Altamirano Dimas said stability in the 
Mexican Stock Market will depend on immediate actions by the 
government. 
  [Begin Altamirano recording] The interests of the country 
should prevail over other interests no matter how legitimate 
they may be. We want the death of Colosio to be cleared up and 
explained. We join the demand that exists. We want an in-depth 
investigation. Those responsible should be arrested and 
punished with the full weight of the law. We also believe the 
1994 election process should be clean and legitimate. I believe 
it all goes together. Whoever wants to bet against this 
situation would be sowing uncertainty and possibly violence in 
the country. We do not want that. [end recording] 
  Gonzalo Altamirano Dimas, president of the PAN in the 
capital, also said the PRI should have a new presidential 
candidate soon because he will have to conduct an intense 
campaign as the opposition is already getting the citizens' 
support. 
  In addition, deputies from the Party of the Democratic 
Revolution [PRD] rejected all kinds of violence and sent their 
condolences to the relatives of Luis Donaldo Colosio. In a news 
conference, the PRD deputies demanded a thorough investigation 
of the PRI candidate's assassination and demanded that those 
found guilty be punished. PRD Deputy Alejandro Encinas said the 
commission that will investigate the attack on Luis Donaldo 
Colosio has begun to operate and will be in Tijuana on Saturday 
to meet with the high-ranking federal authorities. The PRD 
deputy said the area where the attack took place will be studied 
and a detailed report will be drafted that will be submitted on 
Monday to the Congressional Permanent Commission, which will 
also hold sessions on that day. That is all we have for now.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Sarmiento from the Chamber of Deputies </F>
in Mexico City] 
  [Text] No one should speculate, so that the economic and 
political problems in the country do not worsen. This statement 
was made by Gonzalo Altamirano Dimas, a deputy from the National 
Action Party [PAN] and party president in the Federal District. 
He added that although the Mexican Stock Exchange [BMV] has 
experienced some drops, this is something natural due to the 
recent murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio. In an interview, Gonzalo 
Altamirano Dimas said that the stability of the BMV will depend 
on immediate actions by the authorities. 
  [Begin Altamirano Dimas recording] We must be prudent, the 
country's interests must prevail over all other interests, 
regardless of how legitimate these may be. The death of Mr. 
Colosio must be cleared up. We join this clamor for a thorough 
investigation and that the persons responsible for the attack be 
arrested and punished with the full weight of the law. [end 
recording] 
  Meanwhile, the parliamentary group of the Party of the 
Democratic Revolution [PRD] has also rejected all ties with 
violence. In a news conference, the PRD wing at the Chamber of 
Deputies sent condolences to the family of Luis Donaldo Colosio 
Murrieta. The party demanded a thorough investigation and 
clarification of the presidential candidate's murder. 
  PRD Deputy Alejandro Encinas announced the commission to 
investigate the attack on Luis Donaldo Colosio has begun to work 
and will be in Tijuana early Saturday morning to meet with the 
highest federal authorities, study the area where Colosio was 
killed, and prepare a detailed report that will be presented on

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The Mexican financial sector 
has asked investors to remain calm and to trust the country's 
economic plan. Interviewed separately, Manuel Robleda, Antonio 
del Valle, and Roberto Hernandez have agreed Mexico's economic 
program is more viable now than ever. 
  Robleda, president of the Mexican Stock Market, has 
explained 
Mexican negotiable documents for sale on international markets 
over the past two days have received reactions which although 
not favorable were not negative; thus, he said, investors should 
maintain their usual calm. 
  Meanwhile, Antonio del Valle, director of the (?Premio 
International Group), has said this is not the time to 
speculate, but rather to work for the economy's success. 
  Roberto Hernandez, president of the Mexican Association of 
Banks, has urged everyone to remain calm, because Mexico's 
economic stability is real; thus, he said, investments should be 
made in pesos. [passage omitted] 
  Interviewed after the second confirmation of the economic 
pact, Hernandez, who is also a National Bank of Mexico board 
member, said Mexico's induction into the OECD clearly proves 
Mexico is considered a first world country.

<F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Mexican private sector has guaranteed that the 
violent events that led to the death of Luis Donaldo Colosio 
will not change the economic course of the nation nor will they 
provoke flight of capital or depreciation of the peso. The 
reason for this is because Mexico has solid instruments for 
confronting possible alterations in the financial markets. 
  [Begin unidentified entrepreneur recording] We feel that we 
have a solid project, particularly if we all defend it. [end 
recording] 
  The entrepreneur pointed out that an emergency plan is not 
needed, nor any additional measures other than the ones agreed 
upon in the current agreement. Nonetheless, he warned that we 
must be very cautious and not allow strange forces to manipulate 
us and alter the economic and political program or even lead to 
destabilization. 
  [Begin Antonio Sanchez Diaz de Rivera, president of Mexican 
Employers Confederation, recording] Some are trying to attain 
that destabilization. Nonetheless, if all sectors are united 
and there is social unity, and if authorities and society act 
jointly to prevent it, we will definitely prevent it. [end 
recording] 
  In matters of politics, the businessmen pointed out that 
although the death of the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary 
Party] presidential candidate will somewhat tarnish the 
electoral process, they ruled out the possibility that the 
elections be postponed beyond 21 August. 
  [Begin Ricardo Dajer Nahum, president of Confederation of 
National Chambers of Commerce, recording] I think the elections 
must be held on 21 August. I feel we cannot allow the 
objectives of those who have provoked a series of events -- that 
we denounced in a certain way last week -- to be attained. [end 
recording] 
  As for the financial markets that remain closed on Thursday 
as a sign of mourning, Manuel Robleda, leader of the Mexican 
Stock Market, urged investors to be prudent, as it was observed 
in the foreign market that Mexican Government debt titles 
registered a moderate drop. 
  Throughout the financial institutions, the polled 
businessmen 
said they were determined to continue working for the benefit of 
the economic project. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified businessman] The economy 
must 
remain at the same level it is now. It must maintain the same 
standards of living we have and continue working as usual. 
  [Second unidentified businessman] There will not be any 
movements that will change our country's way of living. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Jose Prado from the "This Sunday" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Permanent Commission of Congress has approved 
those Banco de Mexico officials who will lead the institution in 
its new autonomous era. The general director of the Board of 
Governors is Miguel Mancera Aguayo and the deputy governors are 
Guillermo Prieto Fortun, Ariel Buira Siera, Jesus Marco Jacaman, 
and Francisco Gil Diaz. 
  In leaving the Permanent Commission conference room, newsmen 
asked Mancera Aguayo whether the nation was facing the risk of 
an economic crisis. He answered: 
  [Begin Mancera recording] Nothing of the sort. The economy 
is 
very firm. The country has strong reserves and the markets are 
calm following yesterday's transactions. [end recording] 
  Mr. Mancera refused to disclose the exact amount of Banco de 
Mexico's international reserves. He said this information is 
reported every four months, and added that it is not an 
appropriate time now to release this information. He did say, 
however, that the bank has attained its highest level of 
international reserves ever. 
  Mancera also commented on the Institutional Revolutionary 
Party's [PRI] political situation and its impact on the economy. 
  [Begin Mancera recording] The prompt designation of a new 
PRI 
presidential candidate is very desirable. Political calm greatly 
contributes to economic stability. [end recording] 
  The Permanent Commission of Congress will resume its 
sessions 
Monday.

  [Editorial report] The following is a compilation of 
reactions to the assassination of Institutional Revolutionary 
Party (PRI) presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta 
on 23 March in Tijuana, Baja California. 
  Today, Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon expressed 
deep sorrow for Colosio's murder to Mexican President Salinas. 
Calderon said the assassination will "obviously" have 
repercussions on the Mexican elections, and added that problems 
in Mexico and all countries should be resolved through dialogue. 
(Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1559 GMT 24 Mar 94) 
  Today, Salvadoran news media extensively covered Colosio's 
assassination. Foreign Ministry sources informed ACAN-EFE that 
the government has not issued an official statement concerning 
the assassination yet. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1530 GMT 24 
Mar 94) 
  Guatemalan political leaders expressed regret and 
condemnation of Colosio's assassination. National Congress 
President Vinicio Villar, a Christian Democrat, said social 
differences should be resolved through dialogue and not with 
weapons. The Union of the National Center (UCN) issued a 
communique expressing regret for Colosio's death and compared it 
to the 1993 murder of UCN presidential candidate Jorge Carpio 
Nicolle. A number of newspapers also carried front-page reports 
of the incident. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1453 GMT 24 Mar 94) 
  Today, the Nicaraguan Government condemned Colosio's 
assassination "in the strongest of terms." An official message 
released by the Social Communications Directorate of the 
Nicaraguan Presidency said that "actions like these, in addition 
to being strongly rejected by the Nicaraguan Government, 
constitute a flagrant violation of the basic principle of the 
right to life." Meanwhile, Tomas Borge, a member of the 
Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN) directorate, 
described the murder as "abominable," adding that Colosio was "a 
man with progressive views who stressed the need for profound 
democratic changes in Mexico." Bayardo Arce, another FSLN 
leader, also condemned Colosio's death, characterizing it as a 
loss for Mexico and the entire world. The tragic event has been 
widely covered by Nicaraguan newspapers. (Panama City ACAN in 
Spanish 1517 GMT 24 Mar 94) 
  Today by telephone, Panamanian President Guillermo Endara 
extended his condolences for Colosio's death to his Mexican 
counterpart Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Colosio's family. 
Endara also issued a statement to ACAN-EFE which read: "May this 
painful incident in Mexico serve as a lesson to every nation, in 
the sense that the ballot is the only valid means of settling 
political differences." (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1500 GMT 24 
Mar 94) 
  Today, Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate of 
Panama's Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), rejected 
Colosio's assassination and said it may be part of a plan to 
destabilize the Mexican state. Perez, a personal friend of 
Colosio's, said that unless the law is changed, the PRI may be 
without a candidate which is absurd because PRI has won every 
election. The PRD candidate said Mexico may be on the path to 
destabilization following the assassination of "an extraordinary 
man who would definitely have been an excellent president for 
the Mexican people." (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1606 GMT 24 
Mar 94)

democratic sectors."

expressions of regret and sorrow."

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of Mexico 
City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish reporting on domestic and 
foreign reaction to the 23 March assassination in Tijuana, Baja 
California, of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, presidential 
candidate for the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI. 
  Radio ACIR at 0544 GMT on 24 March carries a two-minute 
report on a communique issued by the Revolutionary Workers 
Party, PRT, regretting the attack on Luis Donaldo Colosio 
Murrieta and pointing out that although "this action might open 
a period of grave political uncertainty, it should not be cause 
for a repressive atmosphere of political persecution." The PRT 
urges a thorough investigation of the attack, and calls on the 
citizens to remain calm. 
  At 0549 GMT on 24 March, Radio ACIR reports that Canadian 
Prime Minister Jean Chretien said: "In spite of the attack 
against Colosio, Mexico should not stop the changes and reforms 
it has carried out." "This is the price of democracy, the price 
of seeking the people and being close to the people. I cannot 
find words to express the shock of this terrible tragedy," 
Chretien concluded. 
  Radio ACIR carries a one-minute report at 0603 GMT on 24 
March on a communique issued on 23 March by the Mexican Senate 
expressing condolences to the Colosio family over the 
"regrettable" death of Luis Donaldo Colosio. In the communique, 
the Senate adds that "the nation has lost a politician committed 
to freedom, democracy, social justice, and the sovereignty of 
Mexico." 
  At 0628 GMT on 24 March, Radio ACIR reports that the 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front from El Salvador has 
sent condolences, expressing "the strongest rejection of this 
criminal action that will not tarnish the democratic ideals of 
the Mexican people." 
  Mexico City ACIR Network in Spanish at 1457 GMT on 24 March 
carries a live report by Luis Carlos Santoyo from San Cristobal 
de las Casas, Chiapas State. Santoyo reports that the death of 
Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta has been "shocking" to the people 
in San Cristobal de las Casas. The report adds that peace 
commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis first made a statement then 
withdrew to the hotel where he remained throughout the night 
while "security measures were increased." Radio ACIR adds that 
Camacho Solis "looks sad and, to a certain extent, insecure. He 
is very worried about what is happening. He said he did not 
want to make any statements because these are not moments to 
talk about other matters. He said that he feels very sad and 
will go to Mexico City to express his sympathy to Colosio's 
family and the country's political family," the report concluded. 
  Radio ACIR adds at 1551 GMT on 24 March that Honduran 
President Carlos Roberto Reina "deplored" the murder of Colosio, 
and that Reina had telephoned the Mexican ambassador in 
Tegucigalpa to express "the solidarity of the people and 
government of Honduras."

<F P=106> [Report by Jaime Guerrero from the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] On 24 March the 24 countries that make up the OECD 
unanimously agreed to invite Mexico to join the organization. 
The formal induction will take place on 14 April. President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari said that within that organization 
Mexico will enhance its presence in the industrialized 
countries, particularly in Europe's markets. The president made 
these remarks at the ceremony during which the Stability, 
Competitiveness and Employment Pact [PECE] was signed. 
  This was a very timely moment for the private sector, 
laborers, peasants, and government to confirm their economic 
alliance through PECE. At Los Pinos [presidential palace], the 
country's productive sectors totally rejected violence and 
repudiated the assassination of PRI [Institutional Revolutionary 
Party] candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. They totally rejected 
violence and President Carlos Salinas categorically stated that 
Mexico will not stray from its course. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] We unanimously reject every 
attempt 
to make us lose our course, to distract our efforts, to believe 
that a violent offense can discourage Mexico. [end recording] 
  The president called for unity, saying that the peace 
agreements will be fulfilled and adding that only concerted 
efforts and full observance of the law will ensure a better 
future for the Mexican people. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] Today we have confirmed that we 
will defend the efforts made and the opportunities that have 
been created. We will work arm in arm to defend the law; we 
will not allow impunity to deprive us of the serenity that will 
allow us to move forward. [end recording] 
  Participants in the meeting dismissed the possibility that 
the tragic event in Tijuana has destabilized the Mexican 
currency. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] Yesterday's tragic 
event has not translated today into a crisis in the Mexican 
financial market. [end recording] 
  The labor sector proposed less tolerance of violence.

  [Text] Mexico has sufficient foreign exchange reserves to 
confront a possible turbulence in the foreign exchange market, 
which has been strengthened by the $6 billion of support from 
the U.S. Treasury through the "reciprocal support agreements" 
established between the two nations, Pedro Aspe Armella, finance 
and public credit secretary, stated yesterday. 
  These lines of support were increased 500 percent after 
President Bill Clinton issued instructions to U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to bolster President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari's monetary and economic policy. 
  The finance secretary explained that the transactions 
revolving around Mexican foreign debt shares abroad experienced 
quite a drop when stock market operations opened in New York and 
London. This drop, however, was attenuated during the course of 
the day, in what was interpreted as a sign of confidence in the 
country's prompt stabilization. He said he felt conditions are 
right for national financial market operations to resume today 
after having been closed yesterday because of the decree 
declaring a national day of mourning. The stock market, banks, 
and money-exchange offices will observe regular hours today. 
  The Mexican official explained that the reciprocal support 
agreements allow for granting lines of credit up to $1 billion, 
but that Secretary Bentsen advised him that this had now been 
increased to $6 billion. 
  Aspe Armella noted that this aid strengthens the country's 
international foreign exchange reserves, which he regarded as 
"sufficient." He said "real stability is obtained at home" and 
noted that this year there will not be any fiscal deficit, 
according to the directives issued by President Salinas de 
Gortari aimed at ending his administration with an economy that 
is "growing, with solid reserves, order, vision, and direction." 
  Analysts of Salomon Brothers, one of the five most important 
brokerage firms of the world, anticipated that they will 
recommend that U.S. and Mexican investors "not overturn the 
Mexican market" on account of the assassination of Luis Donaldo 
Colosio, PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential 
candidate. 
  They noted that in the coming days the Mexican Stock Market 
will experience "hectic days" with a low tendency, which will 
annul the progress achieved in the past two days. 
  The offices of Standard and Poor's and Duff and Pheps in 
Mexico called an urgent meeting of their analysts to study the 
country's current situation so they will be able to orient 
investors' criteria in the coming days. 
<H5>  Adequate Reserves To Avoid Speculation </H5>
  After meeting with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
yesterday, Miguel Mancero Aguayo, the general director of the 
Bank of Mexico, and Roberto Hernandez, the president of the 
Banamex [National Bank of Mexico] Accival [not further 
identified] Group, said the level of foreign exchange at the 
Central Bank is adequate and will avoid any speculation or 
disproportionate increase in dollars in the country. Interviewed 
at the official Los Pinos residence, both officials maintained 
that the country has the necessary stability. This stability is 
supported by its foreign exchange reserves and the certainty 
created by the ratification of the Stability, Competitiveness 
and Employment Pact (PECE). 
  Roberto Hernandez asserted that rumors about an over demand 
for dollars are baseless and only seek to trigger speculation. 
The country's reserves are sufficiently strong to allow it to 
react to any factor that attempts to destabilize our economy. 
There are no real conditions that can weaken our currency, he 
said. 
  When he spoke, Miguel Mancera Aguayo, who will be the first 
governor of the Bank of Mexico as of 1 April, said they are 
preparing an evaluation on the country's level of reserves to 
guarantee greater stability. In this way, he said, if there is 
a disproportionate demand for dollars today, Friday, we will 
have the necessary support to avoid abrupt movements that could 
hinder the country's economic growth. 
  Furthermore, both officials stated that the Bill Clinton 
administration had begun a program yesterday to support any 
abrupt movement of foreign exchange in the country. Roberto 
Hernandez stated: "At this time, I would make a call to maintain 
our tranquility and objectivity with what is happening in the 
country. The advances and achievements are there and are 
supported by our economy. There is no reason to be concerned." 
  They noted that there is a financial backing of up to $6 
billion that will allow banking operations in the entire country 
to be carried out regularly today. Finally, Roberto Hernandez 
noted that Mexico's entry into OECD is recognition of the 
advances made by Carlos Salinas de Gortari in the area of 
economic policy.

<F P=106> [Report by Jaime Hernandez] </F>
  [Text] Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien yesterday 
began an official three-day visit to Mexico to talk with 
President Carlos Salinas and other Mexican officials on how to 
stimulate bilateral trade in the framework of NAFTA. 
  On landing at the Mexico City International Airport, 
Chretien 
said that Mexico becomes more and more important for Canada. 
"It is truly a pleasure for me to have arrived in Mexico for my 
first official visit, from which I expect good results for both 
countries," he said. 
  According to a Foreign Relations Secretariat report, 
bilateral trade between Canada and the United States amounts to 
$3 billion annually and will soon total $5 billion. The 
document says that, in the framework of NAFTA, the delegates in 
charge of debating antidumping and subsidies as related to the 
agreements between Mexico, United States, and Canada are 
expected to determine the corresponding codes prior to 31 
December 1995. 
  The document adds that in the next five years the three 
countries will spend approximately $30 million in a three-nation 
program to improve the qualification of human resources in 
Mexico and the technical level of the country's universities and 
industries. "Through an enterprise council, the private 
initiative will participate in the creation of training 
standards." 
  In addition, Canada wishes to explore the possibility of 
creating a technical and scientific cooperation sub-group in the 
Mexico-Canada Ministerial Commission, similar to a sub-group 
recently established between Mexico and the United States. 
  The sub-group would attend to matters related to scientific 
exchange programs between the two countries, human resources 
follow-up, technology transfer, and environment protection and 
improvement programs. The two countries approved the creation 
of the sub-group, which is expected to meet at the next 
Ministerial Commission's session, according to the Foreign 
Relations Secretariat. 
  It has also been reported that a new proposal for a 
memorandum of understanding on fishing cooperation that the 
Canadian Ministry of Fisheries and Oceans presented to the 
Mexican Fisheries Secretariat is still being negotiated. 
  According to bilateral agreements, Mexican inspectors at 
Canada's request would travel to eastern Canadian provinces in 
the first week of April 1994 to conduct phytopathological 
inspections of apple orchards. 
  The Canadian Government's request to lift the current 
tariffs 
on wheat and barley exports to that country is also being 
studied. Several enterprises consider the possibility of 
investing in energy and mining. The enterprise Canada World 
Construction will spend 300 million new pesos to mine granite 
and limestone in Izucar de Matamoros. Campbell Resources will 
prospect for and mine gold. 
  In this first visit, the prime minister will attend the 
closing of the industrial and services exposition, Canada 
Expo-94, where more than 450 enterprises are represented and 
which is Canada's largest commercial venture abroad. 
  President Salinas reportedly had dinner with Chretien 
yesterday. The prime minister today is scheduled to meet with 
Salinas at the Los Pinos official residence. Chretien will meet 
with Mexican congress members and offer a reception at the Banco 
General de Canada. He will also meet with Mexico City Mayor 
Manuel Aguilera Gomez, will stand at attention at the Homeland's 
Altar, and hold a news conference at the Canadian Embassy.

  In a news conference held at the Canadian Embassy, Chretien 
has said no final decision has been made on the presence of 
Canadian observers in the federal elections. The prime 
minister, who has already departed, has said he is not offering 
Mexico any special assistance for the time being, because 
Mexico's financial market is stable.

  [Text] Mexico City, 25 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Canadian Prime 
Minister Jean Chretien today congratulated Mexico on its entry 
into the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD). He announced that he asked the business sector in his 
country to carry on with their investment plans for Mexico. 
  During a news conference at the Canadian Embassy in Mexico 
City at the end of his three-day visit, Chretien said: "Mexico's 
entry into the OECD is a sign of the country's progress, which 
has been recognized by the organization's member countries as 
well as other nations." He announced that he had called upon 
members of the Canadian business sector to continue with their 
investments in Mexico because there is economic and political 
stability, despite the murder of the government's presidential 
candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
  Chretien indicated that he made the appeal during a meeting 
this morning with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. He told the 
entrepreneurs to remain calm and to continue with their 
investment plans for Mexico "in order to contribute to the 
growth of the economy and democracy." He made a similar appeal 
to the exhibiters at Canada Expo 94, which is the largest 
commercial exhibition ever organized for a foreign country. 
There are about 430 companies participating in the event, which 
opened on Monday in Mexico City. He said that Mexico is a stable 
country and that "what has impressed me the most is that the 
authorities and the people have remained calm following the 
tragic death of Colosio, and no violence has occurred despite 
the deep consternation." 
  He denied that his country had granted financial aid to 
Mexico, but stressed that he is willing to do so if Mexico 
requests it. 
  Regarding the upcoming general election in Mexico, currently 
set for 21 August, Chretien said that if Mexico requests 
observers or assistance Canada will respond. 
  Chretien said that his first official visit to Canada had 
been successful. He reported progress regarding the talks with 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to define the concepts of 
subsidies and dumping within the NAFTA framework. "Mexico and 
Canada are not strong enough to face the United States alone," 
he said, "therefore we need more countries to join NAFTA to 
balance out the situation." 
  He reported that he had expressed his will to President 
Salinas to resolve the Canadian trade balance deficit with 
Mexico, which is approximately $1.5 billion. He also offered to 
open an office for the state-owned Mexican Petroleum in Calgary, 
Alberta, to sell its services and technology. Chretien made 
other proposals, such as a firm agreement under which the 
Canadian Cameco Corporation would sell uranium to Mexico for its 
nuclear power plant in Laguna Verde, Veracruz, in addition to 
the fuel is now supplies. 
  Chretien left Mexico City just after midday to go to a 
Caribbean beach resort for a two-day rest with his wife.

<F P=106> [Report by Miryam Hazan Bejar: "Nonbank Banks Face Funding </F>
Problems and Regulatory Disparities"] 
  [Text] As part of the process of opening up the financial 
sector and amidst the serious risks resulting from the 
regulatory disparities that are still prevalent, the nonbank 
banks [previous two words in English] or limited purpose 
financial corporations [sociedades financieras de objeto 
limitado -- SOFOL] are beginning to operate in Mexico, but with 
funding problems because the commercial banks lack confidence in 
them and also because they lack the banks' ability to accrue 
funds. 
  Of the 13 institutions authorized by the Secretariat of 
Finance and Public Credit (SHCP), at present only one 
(Independencia) is operating, but it has encountered serious 
difficulties in acquiring funds because the SOFOL's are not 
recognized in financial legislation. 
  Another serious problem, which could become the source of 
many conflicts in the future, is that existing general 
regulations do not specify the SOFOL's capitalization indexes, 
which further increases the distrust that other lending 
institutions have toward them. 
  Furthermore, the only way to guarantee the long-term 
credibility of these institutions is through their operations 
and internal structure, because even though they are regulated 
by the National Banking Commission (CNB) and by the SHCP, Mexico 
has no insurance or legal guarantee to prevent these new 
organizations from perpetrating frauds, which commonly occur in 
the United States, where they have existed for years. 
  Nevertheless, although their levels of trustworthiness have 
not even been established, these new institutions are already 
encountering funding problems due to the lack of information 
that exists concerning them. "That is one of our biggest 
problems," explained Jose Luis Rion, director of Independencia 
and president of the Mexican Association of Limited Purpose 
Financial Corporations (AMSFOL), which was created on 2 March 
during the seminar "New Financial Institutions in Mexico," 
sponsored by the Training Institute. 
  According to Rion, the nonbank banks will have a difficult 
time acquiring, within the short term, options that will lead to 
legislation through which they can acquire funds by issuing 
negotiable documents or obtaining credit from other national and 
foreign financial institutions, and he explained that in 
Independencia's case "we have financed ourselves solely with our 
resources and we know that we are going to suffer losses during 
the first two years." 
  Despite these initial prospects, the nonbank banks promise 
to 
become highly profitable institutions in our country, which is 
why many investors are asking themselves: What are these new 
institutions really all about? 
  David Harris, a member of the Dechert, Price, and Rhoads law 
firm and an expert on the subject of nonbank banks in the United 
States, explained that in the strictest sense of the word a 
nonbank bank is a bank because it has the same powers and 
privileges that a bank has, with the sole exception that it 
limits its activities to a sector and a specific function. This 
explains the origins of the term nonbank bank or bank that is 
not a bank. 
  He continued: Due to the ease with which they escaped the 
Bank Holding Company Law of 1956, which imposed significant 
regulations and many prohibitions on the owners of true banks, 
in the early eighties, following the widespread emergence of 
institutions that acquired the status of nonbank banks in the 
United States, Congress decided in 1987 to prohibit the creation 
of new nonbank banks and concurrently added several new 
restrictions to those that already existed by reducing certain 
status benefits. 
  According to David Harris, one of the U.S. Government's 
greatest concerns regarding the nonbank banks is how these 
institutions use credit based on the idea that the deposits they 
obtain must be protected. In fact, this has proven to be of 
much concern because in the United States these intermediary 
organizations have perpetrated many frauds due to the 
difficulties they have encountered in obtaining legislation 
because they are difficult to define. Nevertheless, Harris said 
that these organizations have become decisive factors in the 
competitiveness of many U.S. companies. 
  Harris said that Mexico is now beginning to experience what 
the United States has experienced for many years: the opening of 
its financial system to new intermediary organizations like 
these. Therefore, the U.S. experience in this area should be 
taken into consideration so that Mexico can make the best of it. 
  Perhaps the most important nonbank bank in the world is 
General Electric Capital, a branch of the General Electric (GE) 
company. According to James Paulsfood, who is in charge of 
Capital's retail businesses and credit cards in Mexico, his 
organization has provided considerable financial support to the 
SOFOL's. He says that thanks to this, Capital's active capital 
has increased considerably. 
  In view of these prospects, these new financial institutions 
constitute a great opportunity for Mexico to support the 
productivity of national companies as long as they manage to 
make the new financial institutions trustworthy for the public 
that is to use them and for the credit institutions that are to 
help fund them.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 25 Mar (DPA) -- Honduran President 
Carlos Roberto Reina ordered the Armed Forces High Command to 
contribute to the restoration of public order, which has been 
altered by different actions in the last few days. Honduras has 
been adversely affected by a series of incidents aimed at 
pressuring the government and which concern the population in 
general. 
  The actions that have been carried out range from strikes in 
the processing industry areas (assembly plants), cement 
industries, high schools, and freight transportation to multiple 
cases of trespassing, especially in the capital of the Republic. 
As for the labor strikes, especially those in the two cement 
plants operating in the country, the situation is creating a 
crisis in the construction industry and immediately generating 
unemployment for more than 100,000 workers. 
  The trespassing into the city's communal and private lands 
obstructs its orderly growth and creates difficulties for local 
authorities, who are in charge of urban development policies and 
who face the problem of being unable to evict the invaders 
because they do not have a police force. 
  The strikes at the high schools are due to the student's 
rejection of compulsory military service just as the Armed 
Forces would like to maintain it. 
  Likewise, the constant increase in family basket prices is 
the focal point of constant demonstrations by the various mass 
organizations, who conduct protest marches in front of the 
Economy Ministry and the downtown streets of Tegucigalpa. The 
military, however, views these events with indifference and even 
though several of these events have led to violence, the public 
security forces have not taken any action. 
  The attitude of the Honduran Army is considered by the 
different sectors of society to be a pressure mechanism to avoid 
the reforms announced by President Carlos Roberto Reina aimed at 
turning compulsory military service into voluntary service. 
Likewise, the military officers' budget has been adversely 
affected because it will be reduced by 10 percent this year. 
  In view of all these incidents which could create situations 
of anarchy in Honduran society, President Carlos Roberto Reina 
ordered the Armed Forces today to cooperate in maintaining 
public order. Adolfo Facusse, the top Honduran business leader, 
and Tegucigalpa Mayor Roberto Acosta said that if the Armed 
Forces do not want to take any action in view of the situation 
experienced in the country, the existence of certain posts makes 
no sense "and are good for nothing," according to Mayor Acosta. 
  The top military hierarchy said their reason for not 
interfering in the different actions being carried out in the 
country is they do not want to show a lack of respect for the 
human rights policy, which is a priority for the current 
Honduran Government. 
  Police Chief Colonel Mario Hung Pacheco said the military 
officers are learning to coexist with "the new policy of respect 
for human rights" and that is why they have to be very careful 
in their actions. He pointed out that they will only intervene 
in those actions where their presence is requested through a 
judicial order or at the explicit request of the president of 
the Republic.

  [Text] Danli -- Following the meeting held yesterday at the 
110th Military Brigade, Honduran and Nicaraguan Army chiefs from 
the area concluded that it is necessary to join forces to 
control the armed groups that operate in the border area. 
  According to a military source, from October to March the 
following incidents were registered: 
  On 20 October -- according to information received from 
Nicaragua -- "El Chacal" [Jose Angel Talavera] entered Honduran 
territory through the Arenales sector with 20 armed men. At the 
same time, 59 adults and 77 minors entered the country as 
refugees. 
  On 24 January four armed men dressed in military uniforms 
entered Honduran territory. They belonged to the demobilized 
contra groups under the command of "Comandante Gringo" [not 
further identified] and carried AK-47, M-16, and FALK rifles. 
They were on their way from Wambalato to Banco Grande. They 
disembarked from four boats at Boca de Yamales. 
  On 10 January 10 individuals, some in civilian dress and 
some 
in military uniforms, were located in La Laguna sector. On that 
same day at El Tablazo a group of eight recontras were 
discovered. 
  On 29 January in La Joya sector three criminals armed with 
AK-47's fired at Gerardo Oliva. On that same day Ignacio 
Rodriguez' farm was assaulted in the PLIZ [not further 
identified] sector by six contras. These individuals stole a 
marine motor valued at 22,000 lempiras, a 3.57 caliber gun, and 
cash. In addition, Rodriguez received threats saying he would be 
killed if he went to the authorities. 
  On 3 March a merchandise distributing truck was assaulted 
and 
the occupants were robbed of 60,000 lempiras. It was learned 
that the assailants were Nicaraguans Dennis Calix, David 
Padilla, Santiago Diaz, and Arsenio Moreno and Honduran Nelson 
Quinonez. 
  Among the list of those victimized are Natividad Eduardo 
Durate and Rigoberto Lagos. Lagos was kidnapped; he paid a 
70,000-lempira ranson. Meanwhile, Pedro Herrera was murdered in 
Guanito community by two individuals wearing military uniforms.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Francisco J. Gurdian M.] </F>
  [Text] With great concern we have seen in the agricultural 
loan tables published by the BND [National Development Bank] 
that the projected disbursements for the 1994-95 season are 
insufficient. 
  I say with great concern, for the amounts listed for each 
item really lack any logic and agricultural meaning. Let us take 
a closer look at this. 
  For sesame, for example, the amount to be financed will be 
477 cordobas per manzana (according to the table published). 
Based on my personal evaluation, the actual production cost will 
be no less than 1,200 cordobas per manzana (I am, of course, 
speaking merely of operating costs). 
  This leaves a balance of 723 cordobas per manzana which the 
grower will have to make up; I do not know where the grower will 
get that money from. The bank, in this case, will only be 
providing 39 percent of the costs that will have to be financed. 
  Then, of course, only 39 percent of the seed's potential is 
going to be produced. That is, if all goes well. It is much more 
likely that production will be less than that percentage. This 
is especially disturbing as those amounts are less than last 
year's, despite the 20 percent devaluation and the constant 
slippages we are experiencing at the present time. 
  The same thing is happening with coffee, sorghum, rice, 
corn, 
etc. 
  This will inevitably mean that the grower will not be able 
to 
pay off his debts to the financial system. Naturally the 
producer, because of all the above, will not be able to repay 
his past unpaid loans that have been restructured or deferred. 
  And, what amounts to the same thing, the high interest 
rates, 
the dollarized credits, and the inadequate amount of these 
loans, will all combine to generate a major liquidity crisis 
that will cause great distress to Nicaragua's heavily indebted 
producers. 
  I have the impression that attempts are being made to 
finance 
more areas while reducing the total amounts to be financed for 
all crops. This is truly cause for much concern. 
  That is why things are going badly in Nicaragua, very badly. 
We have declines in productivity and increases in production 
costs, due primarily to insufficient credit. 
  I will venture to say that the agricultural technology 
tables 
that the bank uses to calculate its financing are far removed 
from reality, and from what is actually needed to produce a good 
crop. 
  And there is something even more serious: the limited funds 
they have planned to disburse will be subject to availability. 
This means that they will approve loans whose actual 
disbursement is not guaranteed. The available bank funds will be 
subject to the funds it has recovered, realizing in advance that 
those recoveries are going to be low, precisely because past 
credit was insufficient to reach points of equilibrium in 
production. 
  In other words, when the producer comes in to apply for a 
loan disbursement to meet some urgent and essential need, it is 
possible that payment will not be made because at that moment 
the bank does not have funds available, thus causing irreparable 
damage to the harvest. 
  Recently in ADAL [Association of Leon Cotton Growers] and 
ANPROSOR [National Association of Sorghum Producers] we 
conducted agricultural experiments designed, among other things, 
to measure the relation between input and productivity. It is 
quite interesting that we found that the best harvests, and 
consequently, the best earnings, were produced by applying 
agricultural technology tables that are different from the ones 
used by the bank. In these experiments, the correct amounts were 
applied in order to produce good crops. 
  It was possible to determine that with adequate 
fertilization 
levels, greater than those estimated, with that alone, sorghum 
production could be increased by 20 quintals per manzana. 
Obviously, the production cost of each quintal of sorghum then 
becomes cheaper. It was proved that the marginal cost of using 
more fertilizer was a very worthwhile investment: it gives us 
the opportunity to sell at low local prices or to export, 
generating sufficient earnings for us to pay off our bank loans 
and be left with a profit. 
  After those experiments, which were repeated many times over 
on farms in different areas, using appropriate statistical 
analyses and good experimental designs, we were able to conclude 
that the best deal the bank can make is to finance production 
costs correctly and in sufficient amounts. 
  And by a better deal for the bank, I mean that its portfolio 
of loan payments in arrears, of refinancing, deferred payments, 
or loan restructurings will be reduced to tolerable levels, like 
those in a country with a normal economy. 
  It seems reasonable, then, that if we want to create a real 
economic renewal and to improve our people's standard of living, 
we should use the valid scientific results that are being 
generated in Nicaragua in order to adjust the necessary 
financing correctly. Let us not deceive ourselves. At the 
present time, the agricultural credit system is making mistakes 
that bring about unpredictable consequences in political, 
social, and economic matters.

<F P=106> [Report by Maria Elena Barrios on an interview with </F>
Panamanian President Guillermo Endara by an unidentified 
reporter on the 27 March OAS secretary general elections; in 
Panama City on 27 March; from the "RPC News" newscast] 
  [Text] With 20 votes in his favor, Colombian President 
Cesar Gaviria today was elected to replace Brazilian Joao 
Clemente Baena Soares as OAS secretary general. Despite 
diplomatic efforts by Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus 
to secure the post for Central America, Niehaus obtained only 14 
votes, including one from Panama. For our country, however, 
this was a very difficult decision, because both candidates 
hailed from neighboring countries with which we maintain good 
relations -- Colombia and Costa Rica. 
  In statements to RPC Radio, Panamanian President Guillermo 
Endara voiced his belief that Gaviria will do a good job and 
that the OAS will assume a new role under his leadership. 
  [Begin recording] [Endara] Although we were committed to 
Costa Rica, I am certain President Gaviria will prove to be a 
historic OAS secretary general. I think the time during which 
the OAS was a dormant, inactive organization has ended. We will 
now see a new OAS with Gaviria as secretary general. We will 
see a dynamic OAS -- an OAS that will promote democracy in the 
hemisphere, one that will promote liberty. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, as for Panama, what expectations 
does the Panamanian Government have in the wake of the Colombian 
President's election? 
  [Endara] President Gaviria reiterated to me -- in fact, he 
has told me repeatedly since he began his bid for the post of 
secretary general -- that regardless of how Panama voted, he 
wanted to have Panama's support, much like Panama would want to 
have his support. I told him that if he was indeed elected, 
Panama would support him not only during my presidency, but that 
I am certain any and all of the seven presidential candidates 
will also support him. I told him I could guarantee this 
support, because we will have a four-month transition period 
during which I hope to maintain good relations with the winner 
of the Panamanian elections. I also told him I am sure we will 
agree that the new president should support Gaviria at the OAS. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, do you think the support the 
United 
States gave the Colombian president's candidacy was the decisive 
factor in today's vote? 
  [Endara] No, no, no. I honestly do not think so. Our vote 
is an example. Although the United States lobbied strongly 
through diplomatic channels, I think President Gaviria has 
merits of his own and qualities that make him an excellent 
candidate. Gaviria, in my opinion, would have won even without 
U.S. backing. [end recording] 
  Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, 47, will probably assume 
the post of OAS secretary general in August.

National Air Service (SAN) with future attacks on their 
aircraft, according to reports issued yesterday. 
  A police source who declined to be identified has revealed 
that the alleged guerrillas informed SAN personnel "if they 
continue to overfly those areas where they had their narcotics 
plantations, they would execute artillery attacks against their 
aircraft." 
  The insurgents threatened to down every helicopter that 
overflew the region and gave a 48-hour deadline to cease those 
incursions. "The Colombian Army in the area where crops are 
located is warned, and so their lives would be endangered." 
  During recent weeks, several SAN airplanes carrying video 
equipment and Panamanian police have overflown the inhospitable 
jungle of Darien Province, where they have detected coca and 
poppy plantations covering an immense number of hectares. 
  Once the report about the alleged guerrillas was confirmed, 
Panamanian police made a new incursion with the aid of the U.S. 
Army, the result of which is unknown. 
  It seems in the next few hours the air operations will be 
intensified in those regions to reach the sites where the rebel 
groups and drug traffickers are guarding the plantations. 
  Until now and unofficially speaking, it is believed the 
guerrillas belong to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia 
(FARC), which protects the drug traffickers' million-dollar 
plantations for hefty sums of money. 
  A report indicated that after announcing their intentions 
the 
FARC rebels may stage an attack against Panamanian aircraft, 
because the report stated the rebels are protected with 
sophisticated weapons of war. 
  In February 1993 a contingent of Panamanian police, with the 
backing of the U.S. Army and DEA officials, destroyed coca and 
marijuana plantations on 90 hectares located in the remote 
Darien Jungle on the border with Colombia. 
  The operation, called "Frontera Libre," was conducted to 
rescue three U.S. "New Tribe" missionaries whom the rebels had 
kidnapped. Several drug traffickers and undocumented aliens were 
arrested during that operation. 
  According to preliminary reports by the Panamanian police, 
the new poppy and coca plantations are scattered in strategic 
jungle areas between Darien and Colombia, making access to them 
difficult. 
  Opium is the plant from which heroine is extracted. It is 
one of the world's deadliest drugs and to date has killed 
thousands of people in the different countries where it is 
consumed.

  [Text] The Supreme Court of Justice, in a plenary session, 
has studied the case of drug trafficker (Jacobo Lerner 
Zimmerman) in detail. Chief Magistrate Arturo Hoyos believes 
that keeping him in jail is the right decision. 
  [Begin Hoyos recording] The habeas corpus we reviewed refers 
to crimes (Mr. Lerner Zimmerman) is accused of committing in the 
Republic of Panama. Regarding said accusations, the Supreme 
Court finds that there is sufficient evidence to hold this 
person in connection with these drug-related crimes against the 
public. [end recording] 
  It is noteworthy that (Jacobo Lerner Zimmerman), a Colombian 
citizen involved in drug trafficking, is wanted by the United 
States for the same crime. The Supreme Court, however, has 
already denied an extradition request. 
  [Begin Hoyos recording] There is a ruling by the Criminal 
Court that denies the extradition request, and that ruling must 
be executed. [end recording] 
  In view of this Supreme Court decision, (Jacobo Lerner 
Zimmerman) will have to spend a long time in jail unless he 
escapes, which is not uncommon in the country's jails among 
people connected with drug trafficking.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 23 Mar (NA) -- Enrique Gorriaran 
Merlo, a former leader of the People's Revolutionary Movement 
(ERP) and current member of the All for the Fatherland Movement 
(MTP), has charged that a campaign "orchestrated by the 
government and spread by the media, and in one way or another 
answers to it" is being waged against him. 
  Gorriaran sent a letter -- signed by "Enrique H. Gorriaran" 
and dated 14 March -- to MTP leaders to request a leave. In it, 
he denounced reports that connect him to the super gang, the 
holdup of an armored car, and the planting of bombs at automatic 
teller machines 
  The letter says: "In my particular case, they have managed 
to convince those who believe whatever people say to think that 
I am either crazy or a criminal, and many others, who only 
believe part of these reports, to doubt that I am a 
revolutionary and to suspect that I belong to an intelligence 
service." 
  Gorriaran asserted that this campaign against him has 
intensified since the La Tablada events when a subversive group 
assaulted the barracks and were bloodily quelled. 
  He complained that "many books that together add up to some 
2,000 pages have been written since then to cater to 300,000 
readers interested in politics, and this is without taking into 
account hundreds of newspaper articles read by millions of 
people." 
  The former ERP member alleged that, as a MTP member, "this 
campaign seeks to damage the development of the political 
organization" of this political movement. 
  "These ill-intentioned reports are seeking to cast a slur on 
the memory of an entire generation of fighters from the 60's and 
70's who have either died or been reported missing in order to 
belittle their examples of dignity and their libertarian 
sacrifices." 
  To that effect, he pointed out that he could not let more 
time pass "without responding to these and other infamies," and 
he considered it "his duty" to devote some time "to reply to 
accusations that have been circulating." 
  To conclude, Gorriaran asked to be relieved of his party 
affiliation for a time "due to the limitations of being 
underground." This suspension will "depend on the time I take 
to draft and order my testimony." 
  The request was accepted at a plenary session of the MTP, 
which "reiterated its trust in the revolutionary example that 
Comrade Gorriaran has been giving throughout all these years of 
militancy." 
  "Gorriaran went underground in January 1988 when a sector of 
Raul Alfonsin's administration accused him of being one of the 
promoters of the raid on the 3d Infantry Regiment headquartered 
at La Tablada, during which more than 20 people died, including 
MTP leader Jorge Banos."

  [Excerpts] La Paz, 26 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Bolivian President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada swore in his new cabinet today, 
thereby ending the ministerial crisis plaguing the first eight 
months of his administration. This will allow Congress to 
approve several projects presented by the Executive Branch. 
  The president told the new members of his cabinet: "The 
stage 
for creativity has ended. Now another stage can begin; one of 
practical and specific actions." 
  Sanchez de Lozada made changes in his 10-member cabinet 
after 
five ministers resigned. He also created a minister at large, 
thereby putting an end to what he believes is the first stage of 
his administration, which was inaugurated on 6 August 1993. 
  The Bolivian leader affirmed that this change was necessary 
because it comes at a vital and significant time for the 
country. Sanchez de Lozada is trying to get Congress to approve 
several draft laws regarding capitalization, popular 
participation, and education reform. [passage omitted] 
  Leaders of the four political parties that comprise the 
ruling coalition were present at the ceremony. They said the 
new cabinet will carry out the changes and programs set forth 
over the past seven months. 
  Max Fernandez, a leader of the Solidarity Civic Unity, who 
is said to be responsible for the cabinet crisis, said, "the 
time has come for the president to receive the conditional 
support of the ruling coalition to demonstrate that changes have 
finally come for the Bolivian people." Fernandez demanded a 
greater say within the Executive Branch in exchange for votes to 
approve the laws Sanchez de Lozada has presented to Congress.

  [Text] La Paz, 26 Mar (EFE) -- Former Bolivian President 
Jaime Paz Zamora announced his withdrawal from politics today. 
The announcement came after a police investigation linking him 
to drug-trafficking activities. 
  In a televised address to the nation, Paz Zamora said during 
his term in office (1989-93) "there was no crime, but there were 
errors," in reference to his relations with Isac Chavarria, 
alias Oso, allegedly Bolivia's most notorious drug trafficker. 
  Paz Zamora appeared spiritless on the television screen. He 
stood as he delivered dramatically his statement at the side of 
a crucifix. 
  The Special Force for the Struggle Against Drug Trafficking 
[Fuerza Especial de Luchas Contra el Narcotrafico--FELCN] 
revealed this week there are indications that during his 
presidential administration, Paz Zamora received and obeyed 
instructions from Chavarria to appoint officers in the Armed 
Forces and the government. 
  FELCN also delivered to a parliamentary commission a report 
indicating relatives of the former president as well as 
distinguished members of the social democratic Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left [MIR], Paz Zamora's party, gave protection to 
the drug trafficker. 
  Among the accused are Susana Seleme, Paz Zamora's secretary 
when he was president, and MIR leader Oscar Eid. 
  Colonel Faustino Rico Toro, who in 1991 was appointed 
commander in chief of the antidrug struggle, was arrested on 22 
March. The U.S. Government asked the Bolivian Government for 
his extradition on drug-trafficking charges on 23 March. 
  In announcing his withdrawal from politics, Paz Zamora, 
current vice president of Socialist International, acknowledged 
implicitly his relations with Chavarria but said he always acted 
in "good faith, close to naivete." 
  Several MIR leaders and relatives of the former president 
have admitted an old friendship united Chavarria and Paz Zamora 
who appear together in various old pictures the media have 
published. 
  Although he admitted his "mistakes," Paz Zamora said today 
he 
is astonished by certain people's "intention to treat 
maliciously" his personal relations, referring to his relations 
with Chavarria, who is in La Paz' maximum security prison. 
  The president said the charges against him "have not been 
proved" and accused his accusers of "tarnishing my family's 
honor." 
  The former president said he is concerned only with "the 
international impact" the charges against him and his party may 
have. He said "an effort is being made now to deny the results 
of the antidrug struggle" that his government waged, a struggle 
that has been acknowledged by the international community, he 
claimed. 
  Since handing the Presidency over to Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada following the 6 June 1993 elections, Paz Zamora has 
secluded himself in his private residence in the town of Tarija, 
on the border with Argentina. 
  He made his only public appearance today since then. It came 
several months after the first reports of the drug-trafficking 
charges against his party, charges that in the past few days 
have centered on him.

  [Text] La Paz, 28 Mar (EFE) -- The Bolivian Government 
today denied statements by former Bolivian President Jaime Paz 
Zamora, who claimed investigations into his alleged ties with 
drug-trafficking activities had "political designs" and were 
"malicious" in nature. 
  The Special Force for the Struggle Against Drug Trafficking 
[Fuerza Especial de Lucha Contra el Narcotrafico -- FELCN] has 
disclosed evidence indicating that Paz Zamora received and 
obeyed instructions from alleged drug trafficker Isaac "Oso" 
Echevarria. The FELCN also reported the alleged ties of several 
leaders of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) with 
drug-trafficking activities during Paz Zamora's administration 
(1989-93). 
  In a short communique, the Ministry of Social Communications 
said, "The FELCN investigations against several MIR leaders are 
not political in nature and, instead, result from the law's 
mandate." 
  In a message to the nation broadcast Saturday night, Paz 
Zamora asserted, "it seems this case is being given perverse 
treatment." He also said that the charges against him were 
"ill-intentioned" and attempted "to cause political damage and 
slander the dignity of the people." 
  The government, however, said, "actions have to be carried 
out in the future by the Judicial Branch and, in some cases, by 
the Legislative Branch," to clarify the charges. Regarding Paz 
Zamora's "irrevocable resignation" announcement saying that he 
would withdraw from politics, the Social Communications Ministry 
said this is Paz Zamora's "personal decision" and that the 
people will be the ones to assess judge it.

  [Text] Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] sources have 
revealed with the assistance of the National Civilian Police 
[PNC], the Usulutan Departmental Electoral Board was able to 
recover the Jucuapa ballot boxes which party poll 
representatives were retaining. 
  Riot agents entered the "Saul Flores" Coed Urban School 
where 
members of the municipal electoral board were holding the boxes. 
  Reports have indicated militants of the Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front, Unity Movement, and Democratic 
Convergence have tried to keep the boxes from the PNC members, 
who succeeded in their objective without any major incidents. 
  Representatives of the above parties did not allow TSE 
delegates to remove the ballot boxes on 20 March, claiming 
"fraud" was committed in the elections and that they should have 
been held in Jucuapa. 
  The disgruntled party representatives warned if the TSE does 
not cancel the Jucuapa elections, the political parties that 
participated in the elections in that region "will adopt a 
municipal government elected by consensus." 
  TSE Magistrate Dr. Jaime Romero Ventura has told EL DIARIO 
DE 
HOY "today (yesterday) at 0800 in the morning, all the voting 
material from Jucuapa reached the TSE." 
  Romero added "because the vote counting could not take place 
in Jucuapa, they are doing it here in the hotel (Presidente)... 
but all (the information from) from Usulutan Department is 
indeed at TSE installations."

<F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] A group of Democrats in the U.S. House of 
Representatives who observed the elections in El Salvador today 
called for the retention of U.S. economic aid until anomalies in 
the voters' registration lists are overcome. 
  Representatives from New York, Illinois, and California 
reported in the United States that they witnessed the courage 
and perseverance of Salvadorans, as well as widespread confusion 
and irregularities in the elections. The observers' spokesman 
said that the problems in electoral registries must be corrected 
by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] so that the run-off 
election, scheduled for 24 April, can be clean and credible. In 
addition, the group asked that the United States link the 
delivery of $55 million in economic aid to the correction of 
errors detected in the electoral registries. 
  Such a request prompted diverse reactions among the 
presidential candidates who headed Sunday's election results: 
Armando Calderon Sol noted that the request lacks any basis. 
Meanwhile, Ruben Zamora said that it was a normal reaction in 
view of the expectations placed on the electoral process. 
  The discontent of certain U.S. legislators, who observed the 
number of errors that marred Sunday's elections, became evident 
today, when they asked that the economic aid to El Salvador be 
retained until the anomalies in the electoral registry are 
corrected. 
  The presidential candidates interpreted this petition 
differently: 
  [Begin recording] [Zamora] Everyone was told that this was 
the election of the century, and yet, 47 percent of the people 
could not vote. Locally, this was frustrating to many people. 
But, internationally, it was also disappointing for many people 
and thus, they are reacting. 
  [Calderon Sol] I think that this lacks any basis. I do not 
know the gentlemen who made this request, but when they hear 
what the United Nations and the international community said, I 
think they will change their minds completely. [end recording] 
  The two candidates met with TSE magistrates on Wednesday. At 
the meeting they explained their points of view with regard to 
Sunday's elections and their proposals for the correction of 
irregularities to speed up the final count. 
  [Begin recording] [Zamora] There are problems that, 
obviously, cannot be solved in one month, such as the 
approximately 300,000 people without voter registration cards. 
However, we can again begin a period to issue cards. But there 
is also the problem of what to do so people can find their names 
on the lists. [end recording] 
  [Calderon Sol] I think that we should be pleased that the 
TSE 
has taken the attitude of welcoming our help and to show a will 
to overcome the problems. [end recording] 
  The candidates trust that the TSE will correct the mistakes 
made on Sunday so that the run-off election can be carried out 
normally. They also suggested that a new period to obtain 
voters' registration cards be established.

that Chile will become much more active in its trade 
negotiations with other countries and that it will adopt a firm 
stance regarding protectionism in keeping with the position of 
the GATT Uruguay Round talks, whose agreement will be signed 
next month. 
  Aninat said the administration will place special emphasis 
on 
the access of Chilean agroindustrial products in the European 
Union, Pacific Asia, and the Northern hemisphere.

<F P=106> [Article from the "Environment and Development" column by </F>
Lilia Duery A.] 
  [Text] Simple, comprehensive, integrating, realistic, and 
feasible are some of the words that describe the Basic 
Environment Law (No. 19300). This law that took 14 months to be 
approved by Congress was implemented on 9 March after its 
publication in the official gazette. 
  In the opinion of the law's authors, the instruments that 
outline the future of Chile's environmental actions are inspired 
in an integrating approach capable of granting, without going 
into details, key and generic guidelines for all national 
environmental problems. In other words, the easiest path was 
chosen, taking into account that with rules at hand it is easier 
to solve problems and progressively tackle each of the 
situations the country must face in this field. This will be 
done through the respective regulations that will be implemented 
over time. 
  The basic law is divided into 94 articles in addition to 
three transitory articles. It consists, basically, of a series 
of definitions and principles regarding its importance, in 
administration and institutional instruments that will allow its 
implementation, and in a system to define responsibility for 
damaging the environment. 
  This new law includes (discarding the idea of codifying in a 
single text the various important regulations in force regarding 
the environment in Chile) two main instruments that will make 
its implementation feasible. National Environment Commission 
(Conama) executive secretary Rafael Asenjo referred to these 
instruments: 
<H5>  Key Instruments </H5>
  The main instrument is the System for the Assessment of the 
Impact on the Environment [Sistema de Evaluacion de Impacto 
Ambiental -- SEIA] that, according to Asenjo, in addition to its 
preventive nature regarding Chilean production activities, deals 
with the international competition demanded in sustainable 
development. It includes procedures for the establishment of 
standards for emissions, quality, and environmental terms, 
giving the productive sector (either public or private) full 
autonomy to choose its own technology to attain these goals. 
  It also includes prevention or decontamination plans, 
whatever is needed, that can resort to market instruments such 
as a "permit for negotiable emissions." Here again, the law 
grants business people the freedom to reach agreements among 
themselves for the fulfillment of environment quality standards 
for a specific area. Rafael Asenjo said: "Once rules for the 
use of this mechanism have been defined, we believe it will 
greatly contribute to a progressive, gradual, and sustained 
reduction of pollution levels." 
  This chapter also includes plans for the handling of natural 
resources, the improvement of the National Wild Areas System 
protected by the state, and the citizenry's participation, 
especially regarding their right to be kept informed on 
environment-related studies. 
<H5>  New Public Service </H5>
  The second instrument of the law is of an institutional 
nature. In fact, Conama ceases to be an advisory commission to 
become a public service, with legal status and its own 
patrimony. Its main role will be to integrate and coordinate 
the environmental activities of all sectors of the public 
administration that have any say in the matter. The executive 
council formed by 10 ministers and the Conama executive director 
also is created. 
  This organization, in turn, will operate in a decentralized 
manner through respective regional environment commissions 
(Coremas) and will act as a horizontal structure at the 
government level that will be supervised by the president of the 
Republic through the ministry secretary general of the 
presidency, a privileged interlocutor between the government and 
the community. Moreover, Conama will be in charge of revising 
and periodically (every five years) updating the regulations 
issued regarding various subjects. In this case, surveillance 
will be absolutely by sectors, except in the case of complaints, 
in which case this service is in charge of making sure the law 
is respected. In this regard, it should be pointed out that 
people may approach the city halls authorized to hear the 
complaint and channel it to the respective Corema or the main 
office if necessary, under threat of a court ruling if it fails 
to do so. 
<H5>  Regional Model </H5>
  In one way or another, this law contains and expresses the 
principles "whoever contaminates pays" (in other words, whoever 
contaminates must include in his costs what it will cost to 
decontaminate), as well as the "gradualism" and "realism" 
principles. 
  Rafael Asenjo said: "This is the result of having explicitly 
tackled the subject from an integrative and comprehensive 
viewpoint for the first time in Chilean law." Therefore, he 
added, when we start to apply the law "we will take a necessary 
quantitative step forward in our country's environmental 
activities." 
  In this sense, Asenjo believes that there is a more 
optimistic future for Chile, noting that the laws dictated 
during the past years by the Latin American countries have not 
followed this model. He commented that despite the huge 
economic and human resources they have earmarked, their 
environmental problems have not been reduced. "We believe the 
reason for this failure in the region has been the attempt to 
solve everything at once with the same law and having created a 
fully sectorial institutional scheme that has lead nowhere and 
caused the various ministries to compete with each other," 
Asenjo commented. 
  Specific regulations are necessary now to start applying the 
environment law.

  [Text] In remarks to journalists President Alberto Fujimori 
has expressed his sorrow over the assassination of the Mexican 
ruling party's presidential candidate, Luis Colosio. 
  The president also stressed that his administration supports 
Peruvian Ambassador to Ecuador Eduardo Ponce, trusting that the 
events that have developed in that nation will not damage 
bilateral relations. 
  [Begin recording] [Fujimori] Really, this is a regrettable 
criminal action. We, as Peruvians, as friends of the Mexicans, 
express our condolences, our deep sorrow, over the assassination 
of the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] candidate. We 
also hope that this despicable action will be investigated and 
that, in this painful situation, Mexico will be able to resolve 
it.

  [Second unidentified reporter, interrupting] Will your 
administration decide to recall our country's ambassador to 
Ecuador following all the problems caused by a poll? 
  [Fujimori] Relations between Peru and Ecuador have always 
been maintained, and are being maintained, at the best possible 
level. There have been some circumstantial events that could be 
misinterpreted, but which do not detract from this high level of 
trust between Peru and Ecuador. I believe Peruvian-Ecuadoran 
friendship and fraternity go beyond any such circumstantial 
events. 
  This represents a denial of recent reports that Peru will 
recall its ambassador. Our relations are being handled 
smoothly. There is direct communication at the Foreign 
Ministry's top levels. He has not been recalled. I deny that 
Ambassador Ponce has been recalled. 
  I am sure that, on the Ecuadoran side, there will be a good 
spirit of understanding of these situations that must not 
tarnish our relationship. Therefore, all possible efforts, as 
our policy has been... [end recording, in progress]

<F P=106> [Article by Victor Andres Ponce -- part one of three] </F>
  [Text] The Supreme Court has 18 justices distributed in two 
civil courts and two criminal courts. Regarding the higher 
courts, there are 249 judges distributed in 20 superior courts. 
  According to experts, the most urgent problems of judicial 
reform are not at those levels. In fact, according to the new 
charter and the Judicial Branch Organic Law, the Supreme Court 
will have less work because it will no longer be the last resort 
but only a court of cassation. In other words, it will review 
the request of the party that the process follows the 
established rules without making judgment on the sentences. The 
superior courts (court of appeal) will now become the last 
resort. 
  A judicial branch executive council source said the appeals 
court does not require so many courts, but rather a high 
specialization of verdicts. Therefore, the main problem at this 
level would be the judges' qualification and specialization. 
  Anyway, there is a deficit in solving cases. In 1993, Lima's 
civil courts did not resolve 25 percent of the cases. Regarding 
criminal courts, only 10 percent of the cases were unresolved. 
  Also, according to the requests received by the Executive 
Council for the creation of courts and appeal courts that were 
not fulfilled, there is a shortage of 25 to 30 percent of judges 
in the entire country. 
<H5>  Shortage of Judges </H5>
  It is at the lower court level where the shortage of judges 
and the judicial system's bad organization are clearly seen. 
According to figures provided by the judicial branch personnel 
directorate, there are 563 lower court judges at the national 
level among the civil, penal, juvenile, labor, and mixed courts. 
According to studies by the Inter-American Development Agency 
(AID) in coordination with Catholic University based on an 
agreement with the judicial branch, if the existence of 184 
provinces in the country is taken into account, and 381 civil, 
penal, and mixed courts, it can be said that there is an average 
of two lower courts per province (the main demand for justices 
is in the criminal and civil courts). 
<H5>  Is There a Shortage of Criminal Judges? </H5>
  Of the 381 judges, 187 are criminal judges. If we take as a 
point of reference the number of inmates who have not received 
sentences yet, we would conclude that the number of judges is 
highly insufficient. In the penitentiaries, 75 percent of the 
inmates are not sentenced. Sometimes they wait several years 
before they are found innocent. Only 25 percent of the cases are 
resolved. 
  But there are exceptions: In the Arequipa judicial district, 
unsentenced inmates reach 50 percent. An investigation should be 
made to find out why it is more efficient. 
  In a Catholic University poll of Lima criminal judges, the 
majority said they had from 100 to 2,000 cases, with an average 
of 550. In answer to a question on how many cases were 
appropriate for efficient work, an average of 250 was given. 
  If a comparison is made of this alleged ideal number of 
cases 
per judge with the average number of cases for each judge, the 
conclusion is that the number of criminal judges in the lower 
courts should be at least doubled. 
  The difference found by the poll is also the result of the 
shift of judges on duty that can lead to corruption, because one 
filing a lawsuit can choose "his judge." The experts' proposal 
is to assign a fixed number of judges per shift. This could be 
changed according to the process' complexity. 
<H5>  Effects of Penal Legislation </H5>
  There are factors other than the number of judges. One of 
them is indiscriminate laws. For example, Congressman Cesar 
Fernandez Arce maintains that the antidrug trafficking law does 
not establish any difference between a drug "pusher" and the 
chief of a drug trafficking gang, consequently crowding prisons 
in the jungle region. This is why the judicial branch Executive 
Council has decided to present draft bills reforming the 
antidrug law and to apply the new Penal Procedural Law in order 
to reduce the amount of defendants by 75 percent in the whole 
country. 
<H5>  Effects of Informatics </H5>
  The executive branch has implemented a pilot program in the 
Second Lima Penal Court with the help of U.S. organization AID 
and the judicial branch. 
  The contrasts were evident the day we visited that 
courthouse: Unlike other courthouses, there was no crowding of 
people and there were no mountains of files on the tables. 
  A secretary informed us that the proceedings' 
computerization 
has expedited the work because files, decisions, and proceedings 
are in a computer file. However, the secretary added, given the 
lack of trained administrative personnel, the secretaries (of 
which there are two in each court) are the ones responsible for 
feeding the files into computers, a procedure that overloads 
them with work. 
  The computerized service's results are nonetheless evident 
because the average number of sentences issued by Lima courts 
during 1993 -- according to the Lima Appellate Court -- was 18 
per month. In the case of the Second Lima Penal Court it was 36. 
This result shows that the procedures' computerization can 
double a judge's productivity. 
<H5>  Effects of the New Procedural Law </H5>
  The new Penal Procedural Law takes effect 20 May if its 
implementation is not suspended again for the fourth time. The 
main new provision established by this new law is that an 
inquiry's commencement and procedures, besides the indictment 
procedures, must be made by the District Attorney's Office. 
  The courts must determine the acquittal or not of the 
defendants and issue sentences. In other words, the penal courts 
would be relieved of long inquiries and will pass sentences. 
  According to the current law procedure, in cases of oral 
trials a penal court commences an inquiry and presents its 
findings to an upper penal court (second instance). In case of 
petty crimes, summary trials -- in which the same judge carries 
out the investigations and issues a sentence -- are held. 
  "It is, therefore, very different to hear an average of 550 
trials under the current Penal Procedural Law than to hear them 
under the new law under which the inquiry is already completed," 
states legal expert Carlos Rivera from the Institute for the 
Defense of Law. 
  The Judicial Branch Inquiry Center presided over by Roberto 
Alvarez believes the number of judges in Lima is enough to apply 
the new Penal Procedural Law. 
  "The problems, however, will be transferred to the district 
attorney," Rivera states. It has been learned that the 
postponement in implementing the new Penal Procedural Law is due 
to the prosecutors' inability to carry out the new procedural 
duties. 
  "If the new law were applied all of a sudden all the cases 
would be delayed because reorganization takes time," Rivera said. 
<H5>  Attorney General's Office Will Need More Prosecutors </H5>
  The question now is whether the public prosecutor offices 
are 
either prepared or if they have enough personnel to carry out 
the inquiries. 
  Under the current system the Attorney General's Office must 
present the charges in defense of the interests of society. In 
order to comply with this objective, there exist almost 700 
public prosecutors assigned according to the amount of lower and 
upper courts (mainly penal courts) in the judicial branch. 
  Each penal court has one provincial prosecutor. 
  In the case of upper penal courts, there are appellate court 
prosecutors, who in turn have assistant prosecutors. 
  On top are Supreme Court prosecutors, who are organized 
according to Supreme Court sections. There are five sections 
(two penal, two civilian, and one constitutional court); 
therefore, there are five supreme prosecutors. 
<H5>  Fiscal Attorney Influences? </H5>
  Generally speaking, the Attorney General's Office never had 
problems fulfilling its duty of raising formal charges because 
it never conducted investigations. In the Peruvian tradition, 
the majority of crimes handled by the Attorney General's Office 
have previously been investigated by police precincts or 
stations. Moreover, attorneys usually do not probe the 
investigation or contradict what is reported by police. 
  But what will happen when the Attorney General's Office is 
assigned to conduct the pre-trial inquest as it should be? 
  If we take into account that according to the aforementioned 
report, 75 percent of penal cases are neglected and (if the 
procedural law codes are not computerized and amended), it is 
obvious that the Attorney General's Office will be unable to 
meet the demand with its current personnel. 
  To clarify this statement we also must take into account the 
time needed to conduct a pre-trial inquest with the current 
penal judges and compare the working conditions of the 
provincial attorney general's offices with that of the courts. 
  If we take into account that according to Apoyo the 
indictment procedure currently conducted by the Attorney 
General's Office takes an average of 80 days and the pre-trial 
inquest conducted by penal court judges takes an average of 286 
days, we will have an idea of the number of new provincial 
attorney generals that must be appointed so they can fulfill 
their new duties. 
<H5>  Working Conditions in Attorney General's Office </H5>
  It is the provincial attorney general's offices -- which are 
associated with the first instance courts -- that will be in 
charge of conducting future pre-trial inquests. 
  Each provincial attorney general's office has three 
"technical experts" (who are generally either law students or 
law school graduates) and an administrative worker who is in 
charge of the dispatches. 
  If we compare the personnel assigned to a provincial 
attorney 
general's office with that of a penal court -- which has one 
judge, four counselors, and two administrative secretaries -- 
the differences are obvious. It is not only a quantitative but 
also qualitative difference because the majority of courts 
secretaries are lawyers and assist the judges with their 
professional expertise. 
  There is no need to explain that because of the current 
number of attorney generals, the infrastructure, and the 
personnel on hand, the penal courts will take far more than the 
286 days they currently take for summary proceedings, and this 
will weaken the penal justice situation even further. 
  This is such an obvious fact that the enforcement of the new 
Penal Procedure Law has been postponed three times solely for 
this reason. 
  Experts assert that to assume its new responsibilities, the 
Attorney General's Office needs to increase the number of 
attorneys, improve its infrastructure, and increase its 
personnel. An Attorney General's office member said: "Each 
provincial attorney general must have at least three attorneys." 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  Should the situation remain the same, that is, if the 
current 
Penal Procedure Law continues to be enforced and the courts are 
not computerized, it is obvious that in Lima alone the number of 
judges should double. If the ideal number of cases per judge is 
250, this conclusion is obvious. 
  With the new Penal Procedure Law and computerized courts, 
the 
processes are expedited and judges will double their production. 
A judicial branch Executive Council member said: "If this is 
the case, we will be forced to reduce the number of judges." 
The problem, however, does not disappear. It is simply 
transferred to the attorneys. 
  As for the Attorney General's Office, by reviewing the 
current figures, it can be concluded that the enforcement of the 
new Penal Procedure Law will only be feasible if the number of 
provincial attorneys is increased threefold. Moreover, each 
attorney must have an assistant who must be a law school 
graduate. The number of assistants needed may be reduced by 
half if the attorneys' offices are computerized.

  [Excerpt] If President Alberto Fujimori's government does 
not amend regulations that harm the Peruvian workers by June, 
the U.S. Department of Commerce will eliminate the preferential 
tax system for non-traditional goods which will represent a loss 
of $300 million for Peru. 
  This announcement was made by Teodulo Hernandez, secretary 
general of the CGTP [General Confederation of Peruvian Workers]. 
He said the U.S. Department of Commerce has suspended until June 
the implementation of sanctions against Peru for systematically 
violating 16 workers' rights recognized by the International 
Labor Organization [ILO]. 
  Hernandez said that the implementation of sanctions was 
postponed at his request, in his capacity as highest 
representative of the Peruvian labor union, to the U.S. 
Department of Commerce in Washington. 
  Hernandez said: "We have given President Alberto Fujimori's 
government time (104 days) to eliminate the articles of the 
labor law that violate the Peruvian workers' rights and 
liberties." 
  Moreover, he demanded the resignation of Labor Minister 
Augusto Antonioli and of Ricardo Marcerano, CCD [Democratic 
Constituent Congress] Labor and Social Security Commission 
president, who are regarded as responsible for the possible 
sanction. 
  Hernandez recalled that in June 1992 the CGTP and other 
Peruvian labor unions reported the systematic violation of 
workers' rights in Peru to the ILO. 
  The labor union leader said: "The final ILO report 
questioned 
16 articles of the labor law. Moreover, the American Federation 
of Labor of the United States acknowledged this report and 
submitted it to the U.S. Department of Commerce." 
  Hernandez explained that, in his capacity as CGTP leader, he 
and other leaders visited Washington between 9 and 11 March to 
explain to the U.S. authorities the current situation of the 
Peruvian workers as a result of the laws enacted by Fujimori's 
government. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article from the "Farewell to Arms" column by Carlos Tapia: </F>
"The Armed Forces and Drug Trafficking] 
  [Text] According to drug experts, 600 metric tons of 
cocaine base currently are manufactured in Peru. Less than 5 
percent of this immense amount of drug was seized and destroyed 
in 1993 despite the Armed Forces joining the fight to eradicate 
this scourge. 
  Powerful international market forces have consolidated a 
demand that pressures -- in the face of the lack of real and 
competitive alternatives, besides many other factors -- humble 
coca-producing peasants who have gradually become cocaine base 
producers. 
  Given the business' illegal characteristic, the "firms" and 
organized gangs that stock cocaine base and transport it either 
domestically or abroad are the ones that obtain the greatest 
percentage of the "added value." This is so because the risk of 
transporting this particular kind of merchandise to Colombian 
laboratories where it is transformed into cocaine hydrochloride 
is very big. 
  This business requires armed groups for protection and for 
administering an efficient and modern corruption network at all 
levels. The latter is much more important than the former to 
ensure the business' success. That is why new "clandestine" 
airports are opened as soon as others are closed down. 
  The solution to this problem has social aspects and 
presupposes very large financial investments. It also requires 
efficient and intelligent police repression. But no matter how 
you look at it, there is no justification for military 
intervention in drug enforcement. 
  If the power of drug trafficking to finance terrorism has 
been clearly established, it is senseless to allow -- now under 
the current situation of subversion -- the Armed Forces to 
assume the main responsibility for fighting this scourge in the 
drug trafficking zones. 
  The risks are very big and the consequences very serious. 
Once I heard a high-ranking Army officer commissioned to the 
Huallaga Front say: "...my officers go out with very high 
morale; they are willing to confront the subversives and fight 
under the most difficult conditions, but I am not sure they can 
resist an envelope with $10,000." 
  The case is that if a battalion officer engages in criminal 
actions, he is interested in involving other soldiers to ensure 
their silence and avoid sanctions. A wrongly understood 
comradeship could end in complicity. 
  Those who do not accept such complicity can be the object of 
arbitrary sanctions or persecution by other officers involved in 
drug trafficking. There are also many other honest officers who 
do not accept getting involved but prefer to remain silent in 
order to avoid problems. 
  The case of "Vaticano" has negatively affected the Armed 
Forces' image, especially the Army. Why must the Armed Forces 
continue doing a job that strictly pertains to the police? Would 
it not be better to look for another Ketin Vidal [police officer 
who arrested Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman] to fight drug 
trafficking?

  [Text] According to Joint Command information, between June 
1992 and February 1994 the Armed Forces and National Police 
[PNP] arrested a total of 7,667 members of the Shining Path [SL] 
and Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Forces [MRTA]. 
  The number of SL and MRTA terrorists arrested between June 
1992 and December 1993 amounts to 6,300, which shows the 
effectiveness of the anti-terrorist strategy implemented by the 
government because in only 18 months the security forces 
arrested more terrorists than during the previous 12 years: 
Between 1980 and 1991 a total of 5,403 terrorists were arrested. 
  So far this year, during January and February, the number of 
arrested SL and MRTA terrorists amounts to 1,367. 
  Moreover, according to statistics from the Special 
Prosecutor 
for Terrorist Crimes, 4,099 terrorists have benefited from the 
repentance law (Decree Law No. 25499), promulgated in May 1992. 
  The new anti-terrorist law, which has been in force for more 
than 18 months, has allowed the trial of 1,104 terrorists, a 
significant number compared to the 1981-1992 period during which 
576 rulings for terrorist crimes were passed down. 
  The military court has sentenced 451 terrorists for treason, 
of which 288 were sentenced to life imprisonment. Civil courts 
sentenced 653 individuals for terrorist actions, 19 of whom were 
sentenced to life imprisonment. 
  The Armed Forces Joint Command disclosed that during the 
past 
14 years 26,000 Peruvians died as a result of terrorist actions. 
Of this total, 2,075 were members of the Armed Forces and PNP. 
  The number of terrorist actions dropped noticeably in 1993. 
Only 1,306 terrorist actions were registered last year while 
2,049 were registered in 1992. 
  According to official reports, the harsh blows struck by the 
security forces against the Shining Path have caused it to 
reduce its activities throughout the country. 
  In view of the effectiveness of the military and police 
operations, the terrorist groups' morale is quite affected and 
this has brought confusion and uncertainty to their actions. 
This has resulted in many desertions as well as a considerable 
number of terrorists who have repented. 
  Currently there is a leadership struggle in the SL, and its 
committees lack coordination, which has prompted many SL members 
to perpetrate common crimes and get involved in drug trafficking. 
  The crisis affecting the SL is worsened by the arrest of its 
central committee members as well as the neutralization of its 
propaganda apparatus abroad. 
  The MRTA's situation is similar. Eighty percent of its 
leadership is being held under arrest in high-security prisons 
while 85 percent of the so-called Popular Revolutionary Army has 
been fully dismantled. 
  The MRTA also has serious organization and leadership 
problems as well as logistic and economic difficulties that have 
prompted an incredible number of its members to defect. Many of 
its members have deserted and are now stealing, carrying out 
holdups, or are involved with drug traffickers. 
  Currently, MRTA's actions are only sporadic and isolated 
because of the lack of coordination between its regional 
committees. MRTA's morale is also very low and its members 
benefit greatly from the repentance law.

  [Excerpt] Ivan Dibos, deputy mayor of the municipality of 
Lima, on 16 March warned of the lack of economic resources 
needed to pay the salaries of the municipality's employees and 
for public sanitation services in Cercado District. 
  He added that this problem must be resolved by the central 
government, taking into account that it affects the public and 
that the problem was created by the government when it 
implemented Legislative Decree No. 776, which pruned the 
municipality's tax benefits. 
  Dibos indicated that this month (March) it will be very 
difficult to cover the employees' payroll, which amounts to some 
4.5 million new soles. 
  He stated that the estimated deficit amounts to 60 million 
new soles per annum. "The problem is very serious, and we do 
not have the resources needed to pay employees' salaries," he 
said. [passage omitted]

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Peru monitored through 24 
March. 
  Eurobonds have become a good alternative for Peruvian 
companies that need to obtain financing without paying the high 
interest rates charged by the local financial system. Companies 
must pay those who buy the bonds an average interest rate of 8 
to 10 percent per year to obtain the disbursement almost 
immediately. The Arias Group's La Poderosa mine was the first 
company to issue Eurobonds. It obtained a 10.75 percent profit 
in one year from the sale of $6 million worth of Eurobonds 
issued in December 1993. The Rodriguez Banda Group's Gloria 
company and the Tele2000 company will issue $40 million each in 
Eurobonds in March. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 9 Mar 94 p A24) 
  National Mining Association President Roque Benavides Ganoza 
expects the mining sector to attract $7 billion in investment in 
the next five years. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 12 Mar 94 p A26) 
  After six years, the French Government has decided to renew 
trade guarantees for Peruvian exports to France. The French 
Insurance Company for Foreign Trade has guaranteed short-term 
exports valued at approximately $3.5 million, which could grow 
to $9.5 million in 1995. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 11 Mar 94 p 
A24) 
  A Mining and Energy Ministry source reported that gold 
production increased 12 percent in 1993, after the Yanacocha 
mining processing plant began operation. Production totalled 
57,603 troy ounces in January, 6 percent more than in the same 
month last year. (Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish 11 Mar 94 B1) 
  The Central Reserve Bank's net international reserves 
reached 
a record $3.46 billion through 18 February, an increase of $260 
million compared with the previous week. (Lima EL PERUANO in 
Spanish 11 Mar 94 p B2) 
  On 15 March, the Mining and Energy Ministry reported that 
average oil production was 130,763 barrels per day in the 
January-February period, higher than the same months in 1993 
when it was 123,440 barrels. The ministry expects average oil 
production in 1994 to be 132,000 barrels per day. (Lima EL 
PERUANO in Spanish 16 Mar 94 p B3) 
  The Andean Development Corporation approved credits of up 
$140 million for Peru. They will be used to implement programs 
for small enterprises and highway development projects. (Lima EL 
COMERCIO in Spanish 16 Mar 94 p 1) 
  Japan granted Peru a $21 million loan to finance health 
programs. It also will donate equipment worth $180,000 for 
people affected by floods. (Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish 16 Mar 94 
p 1) 
  During the 15 March congressional session, Economy Minister 
Jorge Camet, Agriculture Minister Absalon Vasquez, and 
representatives of the Democratic Constituent Congress 
Agriculture Committee declared that the agricultural sector has 
been in a state of emergency for approximately two years in the 
wake of floods and plagues affecting the countryside. (Lima EL 
PERUANO in Spanish 16 Mar 94 p B1) 
  Peruvian and Chilean entrepreneurs formed a joint venture 
for 
the exclusive commercialization of Volkswagen cars in Peru with 
an $18 million investment. The Chilean economic group Matisse 
will provide 40 percent of the capital and the Peruvian 
investors 60 percent. (Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish 17 Mar 94 p B2)

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Colombian elections 
scheduled for 29 May. 
  Conservative Party presidential hopeful Juan Diego Jaramillo 
has given up his presidential aspirations. Jaramillo has 
acknowledged most Conservative Party members support the 
candidacy of Andres Pastrana, though he has reiterated he will 
not endorse Pastrana. Jaramillo has concluded he recently 
declined an offer by candidate Miguel Maza Marquez to become his 
running mate. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 19 Mar 
94 p 7A) 
  Upon analyzing the results of the Liberal Party, PL, 
presidential primary election, opposition presidential candidate 
Andres Pastrana said on 14 March that one of his campaign's main 
objectives will be to lure 52 percent of PL members who did not 
vote for Samper. He said Samper was unable to garner 50 percent 
of the vote, because his program is incoherent. Pastrana 
concluded he will also concentrate on seeking the support of 
youths, who appear indifferent regarding the election. (Santa 
Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 15 Mar 94 p 11A) 
  Pastrana highlighted the differences on 20 March between his 
proposal and that of PL candidate Ernesto Samper to build a 
subway in Santa Fe de Bogota. On touring the capital, Pastrana 
said while he will build the subway by granting a concession to 
private companies, Samper will fund construction via new taxes 
and the privatization of public companies. (Santa Fe de Bogota 
Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 0130 GMT 21 Mar 94) 
  Pastrana cited the need on 21 March to strengthen the Army 
and called on guerrillas to demonstrate a genuine desire for 
peace. Speaking at a rally in Florencia, capital of Caqueta 
Department, Pastrana said if guerrillas do not show their 
determination to attain peace, "the Armed Forces will be forced 
to enforce the state's obligation of guaranteeing Colombians' 
lives and property, as established by the Constitution." 
Pastrana pledged to offer credits to peasants to make them 
private entrepreneurs. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision 
Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 0130 GMT 22 Mar 94) 
  Luis Fernando Ramirez, Conservative Party vice presidential 
candidate, has challenged his colleague, Humberto de La Calle, 
to a public debate to discuss ideas and the government program. 
(Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 
0130 GMT 21 Mar 94) 
  Samuel Moreno Rojas, representative of the National People's 
Alliance, has said he will endorse Ernesto Samper in his bid for 
the presidency. Moreno has said Samper's political platform is 
fully committed to social investments. He has concluded Cusiana 
oil resources must be invested in the infrastructure to be able 
to better compete in international markets. Moreno Rojas called 
for the reactivation of the economy in the countryside. (Santa 
Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 25 Mar 
94) 
  The 19 April Movement Democratic Alliance, AD/M-19, 
presidential candidate Antonio Navarro Wolff has chosen Indian 
Jesus Enrique Pinacue as his running mate. AD/M-19 suffered a 
setback on 18 March, however, after Representative Gustavo Petro 
resigned from the party, announcing he will not support Navarro 
in the presidential election. Petro said the results of the 
legislative election reflect the party's inability to 
differentiate itself from traditional parties. (Santa Fe de 
Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 19 Mar 94 p 8A) 
  Navarro Wolff said in Barranquilla on 20 March his running 
mate is the best alternative for Colombians. Meanwhile, vice 
presidential candidate Jesus Enrique Pinacue has said he favors 
the resumption of talks with the guerrillas. (Santa Fe de 
Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 0130 GMT 21 Mar 
94) 
  Eighteen candidates have reportedly registered to run for 
president in the upcoming May elections. Among the most 
prominent candidates are: Ernesto Samper Pizano; Andres 
Pastrana; Enrique Parejo; Antonio Navarro Wolff; Miguel Maza 
Marquez; Gloria Gaytan; Regina Betancur de Liska; Oscar Rojas 
Mazo; Jose Antonio Cortez; and Guillermo Aleman. (Santa Fe de 
Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 1800 GMT 19 Mar

<F P=106> [Commentary by Enrique Santos Calderon: "What Do They Want?" </F>
  [Text] Kidnappings of incumbent or would-be legislators and 
of their spouses or relatives; taking mayors and councilmen 
hostage; selective assassinations of regional political leaders; 
bombings of political headquarters...Besides their customary 
destruction of the nation's assets and violence against law 
enforcement, the guerrillas are now bent on "making their 
presence felt" in the elections. 
  And what a way of doing it: by killing, kidnapping, and 
setting fires. It is ultimately a pitiful cry of political 
powerlessness. It is a clumsy, brutal attempt to show that they 
have not yet become criminals through and through, that they 
still have something to do with politics. This is why they are 
going about disrupting the elections. 
  But what is it that they want? This is something that no one 
has been able to figure out. Aside from their by now timeworn 
platform of cliches and generic slogans (against militarism, 
Yankee imperialism, the oligarchy, multinational oil 
corporations, foreign capital, privatization, etc.) we have not 
heard a single proposal that would suggest to us that they have 
a specific, viable, credible agenda for Colombian society. 
  Their pathetic lack of ideas and suggestions came to the 
fore 
during the long months of talks in Caracas and Tlaxcala, where 
the Guerrilla Coordinator failed to offer a single proposal that 
would set the stage for serious negotiations. It is also true 
that the 1991 constitutional reform left them without major 
arguments. Their petrified discourse about the closed, cliquish 
nature of Colombian democracy was laid to rest by the many 
political guarantees, social rights, and minority protections 
that the new constitution established. 
  But unlike the M-19, EPL [Popular Liberation Army], PRT 
[Revolutionary Workers Party], CRS, Quintin Lame, and other 
armed groups with some political vision, the FARC [Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia] and the ELN [Army of National 
Liberation] never understood or even wanted to understand the 
profound institutional change and democratic opening that the 
Constitutional Convention represented. 
  History passed them by. They were left without arguments or 
proposals. But they held on to their weapons and to the cool 
millions that they make from kidnapping and extortion. And now 
they want to make themselves felt in the election campaign in 
order to demonstrate that they still count, that they are still 
interested in politics. And there they are, engaged in the only 
thing that they know how to do. 
  There is talk that the guerrillas are conducting their 
kidnapping campaign to soften up the political class and build a 
future negotiating base. But this brings us back to the same 
point: To negotiate what? On what conditions and with what 
proposals? 
  The guerrillas in Central America undertook negotiations. 
They had suggestions and proposals and showed that they were 
indeed interested in putting down their weapons and were not 
addicted to violence or corrupted by money. 
  In Mexico, the emergence of the so-called Zapatist 
Liberation 
Army might make the ELN and FARC believe that the armed struggle 
is indeed still valid. But the emergence of this group was due 
to the specific conditions of backwardness and oppression 
besetting the Indians in Mexico's poorest province, and it is 
striking a responsive cord nationwide by questioning a political 
system (one that is indeed closed and cliquish) in which the 
same party has held power since the days of Emiliano Zapata. 
  Commander Marcos, who has turned out to be something of a 
poet as well, has already declared that the talks with the 
government "are on the right track" and has expressed his desire 
to arrive at a just solution and lay down his arms. 
  He is thus not trying to perpetuate the armed struggle or 
turn it into a profession or lifestyle, as the Colombian 
guerrillas are, by all indications. Unable to accept the rule of 
law, set their weapons aside, and embrace the dynamic, changing 
realities of a country that has left them behind, the FARC and 
ELN want to show that they still count for something by 
disrupting the elections as much as they can. 
  They are not going to succeed in preventing elections from 
being held anywhere in the country, except in some isolated 
village. They have neither the military might nor the political 
credibility to do so. This does not mean that they cannot create 
serious disruptions, as they are in fact doing with their rash 
of political kidnappings. 
  There is no way, though, to guarantee that the State can 
protect the thousands of congressional hopefuls, nor can the 
Armed Forces prevent the guerrillas from blowing up checkpoints 
or staging ambushes. An attack on a toll station guarded by 
women is hardly a show of military might, as General Adrada 
rightly pointed out in recent days. 
  But there are likely strategic targets that could be better 
protected. Electric power plants, for example, or communication 
pylons like the one that they blew up on Monday in Cerro de 
Guasca, cutting off contact with that region of Cundinamarca. 
  If the past election campaign was marked by the atrocities 
of 
the narcoterrorists, with a macabre death toll of three 
presidential candidates, this campaign will bear the stigma of 
guerrilla violence. 
  This seems to be the tragic fate of a country with a 
democracy that is permanently under fire. But nothing lasts 
forever. Colombia has already put the nightmare of 
narcoterrorism behind it. And although it may take somewhat 
longer, Colombia will also cast off the yoke that the guerrilla 
criminals are endeavoring to impose on it.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Andres Pastrana, Conservative Party </F>
presidential candidate] 
  [Text] Dear Editor: 
  A short time ago, the president referred to the discussion 
of 
alternatives for managing the income from the Cusiana reserves 
as "the debate of the decade." I think the term is appropriate, 
and I agree with EL TIEMPO on the need for the presidential 
candidates to take a stand on this issue, which, in the coming 
years, will have an impact on the Colombian economy exceeded by 
few other issues. 
  In my case it is easy, because when I prepared the economic 
program that I have submitted to Colombians for their 
consideration, I examined the matter carefully, from the point 
of view of its implications for the balance of payments and the 
budget, and of course its social ramifications. Since I have 
decided not to make any promises I am not capable of fulfilling 
for the country, in preparing the social investment and 
infrastructure programs we were especially careful to 
incorporate a realistic projection of tax revenues, which would 
not have been possible without expressly considering the 
strategy for managing Cusiana revenues. 
  This is a complex issue, and it would be absurd to try to 
cover all of it in a commentary of reasonable length. But 
Colombians know that in this, as in all matters, the crux is 
that the person who aspires to set the course of the country in 
the future must have mental clarity and the ability to put 
together top-flight technical teams. There are a few points that 
I would like to emphasize regarding Cusiana at this initial 
juncture. 
  Above all, Colombia's economy is already of a size that the 
additional revenues that can be expected from an oil boom like 
Cusiana are shocking only to those whose natural tendency is to 
see a problem behind every solution. The total net 
foreign-exchange income from Cusiana will depend a great deal on 
the volatile price of petroleum, but it is unlikely that the 
figure will exceed $3.5 billion a year in 1997. By that time, if 
Colombians decide in 1994 to stay the course set by President 
Gaviria's government, we will have a country with an annual 
production of about $75 billion, and with annual two-way trade 
amounting to some $25 billion per year. 
  Although in that case Cusiana will not be too big for the 
country, the income from the exploitation of our subsoil will 
provide us with a magnificent opportunity to accelerate our 
growth even further and to make the final leap toward 
development, toward a much more just society than the one we 
have now. Obviously, that will require careful management, 
especially in terms of the quantity and quality of public 
spending by the nation and by the territorial entities. There 
are examples of many countries that regressed and even collapsed 
because of a mismanaged oil boom. 
  I know that many Colombians are concerned about the 
possibility that, as a result of the abundance of dollars 
flowing in from the sale of Cusiana oil, there will be a huge 
revaluation of the peso that will make the situation intolerable 
for exporters and for those who compete with imports. Few 
people, however, are yet aware that this unfortunate outcome 
would be almost certain in an economy more closed than the 
current one, which is what some candidates are still dreaming of. 
  To be sure, Cusiana will increase our supply of dollars, but 
the schemes some have put forth to "safeguard" or freeze the 
funds would make sense only as very temporary mechanisms. A 
country like Colombia that has so many needs and so many great 
possibilities should aspire to have a president who will take 
the lead and make sure that these additional resources will be 
used properly in his administration; not a president who, like 
the negligent and wicked slave in Matthew's parable, would 
merely bury in a vault the talents that the Lord gave him. 
  Naturally, the economy has a limited absorptive capacity in 
the short term, and any spending beyond that level would only 
lead to inflation or wasted resources. For this reason, it is 
not enough to try to invest these resources well; the great 
challenge lies in modernizing the entities that are to carry out 
the investments, developing efficient mechanisms such as 
concessions for construction projects, and fighting corruption 
head-on. 
  The only way that these resources can be used properly 
without requiring us to give up other Colombian exports, out of 
fear of a foreign-exchange bottleneck, is to implement a broad 
program to stimulate private investment for agricultural and 
industrial modernization, complemented by a realistic 
infrastructure investment plan. This, of course, would include 
the social infrastructure, represented by the great education 
and potable water program that I have proposed to the country.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Document of the Summit in Cuba"] </F>
  [Text] The presence and meeting of guerrilla leaders in 
Havana, including the participation of Bishop Nel Beltran, 
during the Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Summit for 
Solidarity and Self-Determination of the Peoples, not only 
emerged as a revelation from the accounts of witnesses to a 
ranking state official, it is also set forth in writing in an 
intelligence report. 
  EL TIEMPO obtained this document as the last piece of 
confirmation of its information sources, who met with ranking 
officials and consulted firsthand sources. Contrary to what the 
sources said, the document does not mention Ivan Marquez as 
having participated in the summit, but does confirm other 
reports already published by this newspaper. 
  The original source of the intelligence document is 
precisely 
a ranking, reliable official in the state secret service. "This 
is what military intelligence knows about the summit in Cuba," 
the source told EL TIEMPO. This is why this paper attributed 
the document to the Armed Forces intelligence service. 
  Yesterday, however, in a fax sent at 1011 to EL TIEMPO, 
Brigadier General Fernando Tapias Stamelin, chief of the D-2 
Intelligence Department of the Armed Forces, explained that the 
document had not been issued by the military intelligence 
service. 
  On Friday, during a brief talk with journalists, Army 
Commander General Hernan Jose Guzman said the report "did not 
emanate from military intelligence." EL TIEMPO published the 
letter from General Tapias and a copy of each page of the report 
today: 
  Doctor Hernando Santos 
  Director, Newspaper EL TIEMPO 
  Santa Fe de Bogota. 
  Page 31 of the respective 18 March 1994 edition of the 
newspaper EL TIEMPO, in a four-column report entitled "Military 
Intelligence Knew About the Summit," mentioned a restricted 
three-page report, which allegedly emanated from military 
intelligence. According to the article "the details of the 
unique summit appeared one by one, and, of course, there was 
mention of the presence and participation of Monsignor Nel 
Beltran in the Havana summit. In five paragraphs and two 
subparagraphs, the military intelligence services briefly 
mentioned how much they knew about the participants in the 
meeting. 
  After the Army, Navy, and Air Force intelligence 
directorates, which comprise military intelligence, were 
consulted, all affirmed that the document cited in the article 
does not coincide with any report issued by the aforementioned 
agencies and, therefore, could not have been released to any 
journalist. 
  Yours truly, 
  [signed] Brig. Gen. Fernando Tapias Stamelin 
  Chief of the D2 Intelligence Department of the Armed Forces 
  [The following report appears alongside the previous 
letter, enclosed in box format, with the word RESTRICTED at the 
top and bottom of each of the three pages of the report]

<H3>  Latin American and Caribbean Meeting for Solidarity, 
Self-Determination, and Life of the Peoples, held in Havana 
(Cuba) between 26 and 28 January 1994. </H3>
  Havana (Cuba) PCC [Communist Party of Colombia], FARC 
[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia], ELN [Army of National 
Liberation], and the EPL [Popular Liberation Army] -- The 
"Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Summit for Solidarity and 
Self-Determination and Life of the Peoples," which was attended 
by PCC members and subversives of the FARC, ELN, and EPL was 
also attended by insurgents from 35 Central and South American 
countries, including members of the Mexican Zapatist movement, 
the Salvador Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, and the 
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement of Peru. Those in attendance 
included: 
  1. ALBERTO GUTIERREZ BERMUDEZ -- Alleged head of a FARC 
column, who read a communique by the Colombian subversive groups 
at the meeting. He has been living in Havana for two months in 
Apartment No. 2, Building D-3, Zone-7 Alamar in eastern Havana. 
Other subversives of the ELN and EPL also live in this 
building. Together with other individuals from Central and 
South America they receive subversive training at the 
international aid camp "El Caimito" located in the vicinity of 
Havana. 
  2. IVAN ROMERO and JORGE ORTEGA -- Members of the Central 
Committee of the PCC and officials of the CUT [United Workers 
Confederation] who cooperate with the FARC, supplying it 
information on security organizations and persons who can be 
kidnapped in the middle Magdalena region and Santander. 
  3. HERNANDO VILLATE -- Physician, sergeant-at-arms of the 
PCC, who in his speech criticized the Colombian Government with 
regard to human rights violations. 
  [Page 2] 
  4. JAIME CAICEDO TURRIACO -- PCC president. 
  5. LUIS EFRAIN VILLAMIL -- PCC member. 
  6. ALBERTO SANGUINO -- Colombian worker youth. 
  7. CAMILO CASTELLANOS -- representative of the Cinep 
[Center for Research and Public Education]. 
  8. MARIO GIRALDO VELEZ -- for the Trotskiyite Posada 
Communist Party. 
  9. HERNAN DARIO CARDONA -- president of the Community 
Federation. 
  10. ALFONSO ROMAN -- of the Socialist Renewal Movement. 
  11. TERESA QUINONES -- of the International Women's 
League for Peace and Liberty (IMPAL). 
  This meeting carried out a campaign to discredit Colombia, 
basing itself on the alleged abuses and violations of human 
rights by Colombian authorities. To this end, members of the 
"Group of Peoples Organizations of the Dominican Republic" 
collected signatures among the participants, denouncing tortures 
and mistreatment to which Dominican prisoners are allegedly 
subjected to in Colombia. Apparently AIDA ABELLA coordinated 
training for the members with the FARC. 
  [Page 3] 
  The Colombian subversives who travel to Cuba do not use 
visas. They board a plane in Caracas or Cancun, using the Viasa 
or Adeco airlines, on the Buenos Aires-Caracas-Cancun-Havana 
route. They enter Cuba with a "tourist card" given to them by 
the Caribbean representatives, Asisturis or Asertur, of which 
RICARDO BALLESTEROS ALFONSO and JOAQUIN AMARIS AMARIS, PCC 
members, are co- owners. This is how GUILLERMO LEON SAENZ 
VARGAS (alias Alfonso Cano) of the FARC and LEONEL PARDEO of the 
EPL traveled to Havana on 25 January to meet on 26 January with 
Father Nel Beltran, FIDEL CASTRO, and other unidentified persons 
with the intention of defining a strategy to exert pressure 
through organizations such as Amnesty International and human 
rights organizations so that the national government will 
establish a dialogue with the guerrillas, based on a bilateral 
cease-fire.

<F P=106> [From the "NTC News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The newspaper EL TIEMPO today admitted that Father 
Nel Beltran was not in Cuba, and the people of Sincelejo are 
glad that their parish priest's name has been cleared. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] As for the 
accusations leveled by certain media against the church, as well 
as a campaign to discredit it, Monsignor Nel Beltran Santamaria 
today said he forgives his enemies, adding that he does not 
harbor any feelings of bitterness, resentment, or revenge. 
  [Beltran] Let us seek the truth. I especially urge the 
media to seek the truth. Let us speak the truth. Truth will 
make us free. Truth is light. Death is only present in 
darkness. 
  [Reporter] The bishop today said at the public square in 
Sincelejo that never before in his long career as bishop had he 
had enemies within or outside the church. The monsignor urged 
his parishioners to pray for those who accused him of having 
participated in a guerrilla summit. Evil is not stronger than 
good, monsignor added. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff today 
clarified his office's position regarding the case of the bishop 
being in Cuba: 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] De Greiff said this morning 
that 
his office has never been deceived. He explained that the 
Prosecutor General's Office has evidence -- evidence that 
includes testimonies and documents -- which proves a church 
representative was involved in a guerrilla summit in Havana, 
Cuba. 
  [De Greiff] Whether I should recant is not an issue here. 
The Prosecutor General's Office cannot base its opinion on 
anything but the evidence it has. As I told you, we have such 
evidence. Nevertheless, the evidence countering this evidence is 
respectable. We will have to compare their evidence to ours. As 
for the case of the bishop, we have decided that this not our 
responsibility. [end recording] 
  De Greiff also said his evidence will have to be compared 
with the evidence of other investigative organizations to 
determine which is genuine. Meanwhile, the Prosecutor General's 
Office said Bishop Nel Beltran is not the person in question, as 
has been claimed from the very beginning. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] Is it necessarily Nel Beltran? 
  [De Greiff] Not necessarily. One piece of evidence involves 
a priest. Like I said, this is only one piece of evidence. The 
integrity of this evidence has yet to be determined. [end 
recording] 
  After comparing all of the evidence, the Prosecutor 
General's 
Office will present documents to the Ecclesiastical Tribunal, 
the organization in charge of investigating church 
representatives. [end recording]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 22 Mar (DPA) -- Juan Maria 
Rendon, president of the Colombian Petroleum Enterprise 
[Ecopetrol], today disclosed that the announced daily sale of 
between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil to Havana is in doubt 
because of Havana's failure to offer payment guarantees. 
  The official said negotiations on the oil sales stalled 
after 
Cuba proposed to make its payments contingent on its sugar 
sales, something that could represent problems for Colombia if 
Cuba encounters problems in its sugar trade. Rendon said the 
Colombian Government is demanding the oil sales be backed by 
letters of credit from major international banks, something 
Havana apparently has not considered. 
  The announcement on the sale of oil produced serious 
protests 
among Cubans exiles in Miami, whose most radical sectors have 
proposed boycotting Colombian products exported to Florida. 
  Meanwhile, Colombian political sectors have asked the 
Gaviria 
administration to reconsider its diplomatic relations with Cuba 
after the media disclosed the holding of a "summit" in Havana in 
which several guerrilla leaders and a Catholic bishop allegedly 
participated. According to media reports, it appears the 
meeting took place between 23 and 28 January with the presumed 
consent of Fidel Castro's government. This is why the Colombian 
Government asked for an explanation of the matter in a 
diplomatic note signed by Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin. The 
Cuban Government denied that such a "summit" was ever held. In 
turn, Colombian Government Minister Fabio Villegas said, "we 
have to believe" Cuba, and he ruled out the possibility of 
breaking relations. 
  Diplomatic relations between Santa Fe de Bogota and Havana 
were reestablished in October after having been suspended for 12 
years. Former President Julio Cesar Turbay (1978-82) broke off 
relations after intelligence reports indicated Colombian 
guerrillas had been trained in Cuba.

  [Text] Caracas, 26 Mar (DPA) -- President Rafael Caldera 
made official on Saturday, 26 March, the release of the main 
leader of the 4 February 1992 coup attempt, Lieutenant Colonel 
Hugo Chavez, who during the early morning hours of today also 
requested his discharge from active duty, Radio Caracas Radio 
(RCR) confirmed today. 
  Chavez, regarded as the ideologue of a movement of midlevel 
officers who in 1992 executed two attempts to overthrow then 
President Carlos Andres Perez, was released after two years in 
jail when the president dropped the charges on the condition the 
officers more deeply involved in the coup attempts do not return 
to the Armed Forces. 
  According to RCR, the lieutenant colonel and other officers 
will create a new political organization that will be based on 
the military movement of the nationalist inspiration Chavez 
created within the Armed Forces and which received the public's 
support.

  [Excerpts] Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez Frias, leader of 
the 4 February 1994 military uprising against the government of 
Carlos Andres Perez, will reorganize the 200 Revolutionary 
Bolivarian Movement [MBR-200], making it a political 
organization that will participate in civilian life. He made

President Rafael Caldera signed the resolution that pardoned 
him. [video shows wide shots of a rally and various supporters 
welcoming Chavez's release] 
  [Begin recording of unidentified supporter] Honor and glory 
to the courage of our commander Hugo Chavez Frias! [end 
recording] 
  From early this morning, scores of friends, relatives, and 
supporters awaited Chavez's release at the Defense Ministry in 
Los Proceres. Chavez, as you will remember, was being held at 
the military hospital. At about 0700 he was transferred to the 
Defense Ministry to proceed with his release in accordance with 
the presidential decree granting his pardon. [passage omitted] 
  When he left Fort Tiuna, Chavez tried to hold a news 
conference, but this was impossible because of the 
uncontrollable crowd. [video shows wide shots of pro-Chavez 
rally and supporters wearing berets, waving flags, and 
brandishing portraits of Chavez; video cuts to wide shots of

This time, emotions overcame reason. He announced a news 
conference would be held tomorrow at the Caracas Athenaeum to 
explain the terms under which he will introduce his 
revolutionary movement into the Venezuelan political arena. He 
also is expected to explain his position vis-a-vis the 
government after being pardoned and resigning from the Army. 
  [Begin Chavez recording] The MBR-200 is going to charge into 
the streets and take over political power in Venezuela. The 
military generation, which chose the road of sacrifice and was 
forged at the military installations of Fort Tiuna, will show 
Venezuelan politicians how to lead a nation and how to restore 
its true destiny. [end recording] 
  Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez Frias has several appointments tomorrow 
in Caracas. He will lay a wreath at the grave of Simon Bolivar 
at the National Pantheon. Early next week, he is expected to 
travel to his native Barinas, where he will be welcomed with 
full honors.

  [Text] Caracas, 27 Mar (DPA) -- After spending two years in 
prison for a 1992 coup attempt, Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez 
(retired) today held a news conference while surrounded by 
thousands of "Bolivarian" supporters. During the news 
conference, Chavez did not rule out the possibility of an armed 
struggle, and he called for profound changes in Venezuela, 
including an constituent assembly and economic reforms. 
  With the support of mid-level officers, the ideologue of the 
so-called 200 Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement (MBR-200) 
organized the first coup attempt against former President Carlos 
Andres Perez on 4 February 1992. Today, however, Chavez harshly 
criticized the government of President Rafael Caldera for his 
"improvised plans" to combat the crisis facing the nation, and 
he insisted on the need for "structural reform." 
  Chavez stressed his organization is political in nature, but 
in discussing the group's goal "to seize power," he did not rule 
out the possibility of an armed struggle. Any path, whether by 
way of armed conflict or elections, remains valid, and the 
choice depends on the people, he said, describing himself as a 
"soldier of the people." 
  Chavez added, "We hope for the peaceful path, but we expect 
profound changes." He also noted he did not regret the events 
of February 1992, adding that only "the sovereign" people can 
decide whether or not he stages a rebellion. 
  The news conference, which was attended by a large number of 
reporters, was held in a concert hall, while hundreds of people 
waited in the streets to greet him. Chavez indicated that one 
solution to keep "the people from taking up arms" would be to 
summon a national constituent assembly, and he went on to 
criticize the "politicos" and leaders of the traditional 
political parties. 
  Regarding former President Perez, who is now accused of 
alleged misappropriation of public funds, Chavez was skeptical 
that the Supreme Court would issue a warrant for his arrest, 
adding that he knew of "under the table" agreements by 
Democratic Action and the Social Christian Party to exonerate 
Perez. 
  Chavez, who has benefited from what President Caldera has 
described as "pacification," said peace within the Armed Forces 
can only by achieved through the release of those individuals 
involved in the two coup attempts of 1992 (4 February and 27 
November). 
  He demanded more jobs and respect for the thousands of 
soldiers involved in or accused of being involved in the two 
coups, many of whom have joined the MBR-200, an organization 
that seeks to create a "great national front." 
  Chavez reiterated he struck no deal with President Caldera 
in 
exchange for his release, and instead he criticized the economic 
policies being implemented by the government that took office on 
2 February. 
  "I hope President Caldera confronts the difficult situation 
in our country in a firm and forceful way," Chavez said as he 
answered more than 20 questions posed by reporters from domestic 
and foreign news media. 
  [Caracas Radio Rumbos Network in Spanish at 1836 GMT on 27 
March carries a two-minute report that includes recorded remarks 
made by Chavez to supporters after his 27 March news conference 
had concluded. In the recording, Chavez says: "One cannot talk 
of retirement. Nobody is retiring here, because true soldiers 
never retire. We are now walking hand-in-hand with the people, 
and we are here to appear before the country and to summon unity 
around the strategic goal of transformation."]

  [Text] Within the framework of the pacification policy 
being promoted by President Rafael Caldera, 34 Venezuelan 
soldiers who had sought refuge in Peru returned to the country

Chavez 
Frias, in his second day of freedom following 26 months in 
prison, placed a wreath at the National Pantheon and later held 
a news conference at the Caracas Athenaeum. Jose Marcano filed 
this report. 
  [Begin recording] [Marcano] Commander Chavez greeted the 
crowd gathered at the gate of the National Pantheon before 
heading to the Caracas Athenaeum, where he answered all 
questions posed by domestic and foreign reporters. 
  Chavez answered the simplest to the most complex questions 
with poise and self-control. In terms of economics, he only 
made a brief analysis and criticized the eight plans implemented 
by the democratic administrations. According to Chavez, the 
Sosa economic plan does not offer alternatives for employment 
and investment. Politics is Chavez's priority at this time, but 
he said he must first resurrect Bolivarian ideology and the 
commitment to obtain power. 
  For the time being, Chavez said he will push for the 
convening of a constituent assembly, taking advantage of the 
fact the 4 February events are still fresh in people's minds. 
This, he said, would be the best way to enter the political 
scene. 
  Chavez explained he made no promises to Dr. Caldera's 
Government in exchange for his presidential pardon. He admitted 
there are differences among the members of the 200 Revolutionary 
Bolivarian Movement, and he said he will work to unify it and 
turn it into a political movement that defends the interests of 
the people, without creating a [word indistinct] structure. 
  [Chavez] We are ready to assist the government as much as 
possible. The only thing we can do is to make recommendations. 
For example, when we stand up and call for a constituent 
assembly, we are making a recommendation. I ask the government 
of Dr. Caldera to heed this recommendation. Instead of giving 
Congress constituent powers, as I believe some sectors and even 
the president himself have suggested, we believe this would be a 
mistake because those responsible for the national crisis have 
become entrenched in Congress. 
  Are we going to give them more constituent powers so they 
can 
finish destroying what we have left of our fatherland? No. Let 
us call the people to a constituent assembly. This is a 
recommendation we are making to the government. We hope the 
government heeds our call. If the government wants to talk to 
us, we are ready to talk to the government. [end recording] 
  Commander Chavez today presided over various activities in 
the western part of the capital. Tomorrow he will visit Sabana 
Grande Boulevard and Chacaito, and in the evening he will leave 
for his home state of Barinas, where he will meet with his 
fellow citizens.

  [Text] Caracas, 27 Mar (DPA) -- A group of 34 Venezuelan 
soldiers, including 24 officers, arrived today in Maracay, 130 
km from Caracas, after having remained in Peru for more than a 
year. The soldiers will now have to face legal proceedings in 
connection with their participation in an attempted coup that 
took place on 27 November 1992. 
  The coupists arrived on board a Venezuelan Air Force (FAV) 
Hercules C-130 aircraft accompanied by Colonel Luis Betancourt 
Infante, who accompanied them under orders from the Ministry of 
Defense. Meanwhile, 16 soldiers still remain in Peru, including 
General Francisco Visconti, one of the leading participants in 
the attempt to overthrow former President Carlos Andres Perez. 
  The group of soldiers (24 officers and 10 subordinates) 
arrived at a military base, were taken to the Air Force Academy 
Headquarters, and will later be transferred by helicopter to the 
Army General Command in Caracas. From there they will be driven 
(later tonight) to the division in charge of military personnel 
awaiting trial at the San Carlos Garrison, also located in 
Caracas. 
  After appearing before a military court, the group of 
soldiers will most likely be released under the authority of a 
presidential pardon. This "pacification," as it has been 
called, was one of the campaign promises of President Rafael 
Caldera. 
  Yesterday, for example, Lt. Colonel Hugo Chavez, leader of 
the 4 February 1992 coup was released along with 14 other 
officers. Still pending is the situation surrounding those 
military officers remaining in Lima, including Gen. Visconti, 
who participated in the second 1992 coup attempt to topple 
Perez, which took place on 27 November.

  [Text] The Venezuelan Senate condemns the statements made 
by U.S. Congresswoman Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, who 
criticized the government of her country for exporting [as 
heard] Venezuelan oil, which, according to her, does not meet 
with environmental regulations that are applied to U.S. gasoline. 
  Antonio Ledezma, second vice president of the Senate, said 
he 
learned about the statements made by the U.S. representative 
through the national media. In this regard, he pointed out that 
it is in poor taste for the U.S. Congress to criticize its 
government for purchasing the black liquid since the United 
States has been purchasing Venezuelan oil for many years, even 
when modern technology did not exist. 
  [Begin recording] [Ledezma] Our gasoline is a good product, 
as tests and experts confirm. It contains less toxic elements, 
even less than the percentage that will permitted in 1995 and 
1997. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What do you believe is behind this 
attitude of the U.S. Congress? 
  [Ledezma] It is not an attitude of the U.S. Congress. On 
behalf of Venezuela and on behalf of the Venezuelan Congress, I 
am going to condemn the statements made by this congresswoman, 
Representative Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, who has said that 
our oil is dirty. [end recording] 
  Finally, Senator Antonio Ledezma announced that the Senate 
will approve additional credit to help the Government of the 
Federal District face the current hospital crisis.

the granting of special powers to President Rafael Caldera via

  [Begin Roosen recording] Given the principles that regulate 
us, we believe the Special Powers Law is inappropriate. We urge 
Congress to delegate duties and to work as it did with special

held. At this forum, during which more than 500 participants 
are expected, the reestablishment of suspended economic 
guarantees will be discussed. 
  In conclusion, Roosen has said he agrees with lowering 
interest rates, because Venezuela will go from being a 
bondholder economy to a productive economy.

  [Text] The "24 Hours Newscast" consulted some Central 
American foreign ministries -- that allegedly support Bernd 
Niehaus [Costa Rican foreign minister] -- on the candidate for 
whom they intend to vote in the election for secretary general 
of the Organization of American States. Some of the Central 
American officials charged that they are being pressured by the 
United States to change their vote. 
  The first country consulted was Costa Rica, home of Foreign 
Minister Niehaus -- President Cesar Gaviria's closest rival. 
Here they are already claiming victory. 
  [Begin recording] [Jose Joaquin Chaberry, unidentified Costa 
Rican official] We are certain we will win. We are very certain 
of this. We have reiterated this during the past months and the 
past days.... 
  [Unidentified reporter, interrupting] But do you believe 
pressure is being exerted? 
  [Chaberry] I repeat Foreign Minister Niehaus' words: If 
there 
is pressure, we will report it. [end recording] 
  El Salvador maintains its position to support Niehaus, 
although Deputy Foreign Minister Rafael Alfaro said they are 
being pressured to favor President Cesar Gaviria. 
  [Begin recording] [Alfaro] We continue, nevertheless, with 
our firm support for Foreign Minister Niehaus. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Deputy Foreign Minister, is it true that 
there 
has been pressure on the part of the U.S. Government on the 
Central American nations? 
  [Alfaro] During a meeting we held several days ago in Mexico 
City, an English-speaking nation said it had been directly 
pressured by other nations interested in garnering support for 
President Cesar Gaviria's candidacy.... [end recording] 
  Honduras, a nation recently visited by President Cesar 
Gaviria, expressed a great deal of liking for him, but it 
supports Niehaus because a prior commitment had already been 
made with him. 
  [Begin recording] [Protocol Director Ricardo Alonso Florez] 
We believe that in the first round the Central American nations 
will vote for the Costa Rican candidate, because he is Central 
American. Eventually, if there is a runoff election, a different 
decision could be made. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Our America Commentary" by Manolo Ortega; from the </F>
"Evening Information Review" program] 
  [Text] More than 200 million Latin Americans live in 
poverty, and the fact that nearly half of the region's 
population lives under this condition has become the main 
concern of leaders, presidents, and experts, and it is also the 
main topic of any and all summits held within the region. 
Nevertheless, there are indications this issue could be 
downgraded in the next hemispheric summit convened by U.S. 
President William Clinton, which, according to him, must review 
inter-American relations in the post-Cold War era. 
  Despite the fact that the summit is filled with injustice 
from the start because of the deliberate exclusion of Cuba, U.S. 
Vice President Albert Gore, during his quick tour of Bolivia, 
Argentina, and Brazil, took time to hold an equally quick 
meeting with several of the likely participants at the 
hemispheric summit to issue propaganda about the forum. 
  Most likely, poverty will be one topic discussed at the 
summit. What cannot be certain, however, is whether participants 
will find the formula to eradicate this distressing problem 
because most of the region's presidents are unrelentingly 
applying neoliberal economic programs imposed on them by 
international banks, which have been a main creator of poverty, 
deprivation, and violence. 
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli has said 
poverty represents a new scourge within society, because it 
poses security threats that cannot be fought with armies. He 
stressed poverty is connected with hunger, terrorism, drug 
trafficking, violence, and deprivation. 
  Aside from other personalities who have called attention to 
poverty, such as the current OAS Secretary General Joao Baena 
Soares, everyone is fully aware that there is a close 
relationship between poverty and social violence. Nevertheless, 
no one seems ready to tackle the problem. 
  Meanwhile, there are many bright individuals in Latin 
America 
who have not only realized that poverty is a national security 
risk but who have called attention to the need for the region to 
set up a new economic, political, and cultural integration 
system as the only means of salvation in the face of an 
increasingly competitive and isolationist world. Gradually, 
strong integration programs, such as Mercosur [Common Market of 
the South], the Andean Pact, and other treaties involving Latin 
American and Caribbean nations, are being implemented. These 
pacts are aimed at devising strategies to offset the ominous 
effects of structural adjustment programs. 
  When the connection between poverty and violence is 
discussed, the danger this poses to the stability of democratic 
governments is also mentioned. This is particularly true when 
one understands that 50 percent of the 200 million youngsters 
under the age of 18 in Latin America are excluded from adequate 
social, economic, and cultural benefits. In turn, this 
undermines social equality and justice, which form the 
groundwork of democracy. Therefore, the only way to avoid 
allowing poverty to cause social catastrophe in Latin America is 
by expediting integration, cooperation, and solidarity among our 
peoples. The results may not be immediate, but in time they 
will resolve the problems faced by the majority.

<F P=106> ["Our Opinion" Commentary by Orlando Contreras] </F>
  [Text] Elections will be held in Washington tomorrow, 27 
March, to choose a new OAS secretary general to replace Brazil's 
Joao Baena Soares, undoubtedly one of the most outstanding 
secretaries general of the OAS, an organization which has lost 
much of its prestige. 
  The candidates are current Colombian President Cesar 
Gaviria, 
who will conclude his presidential term by the middle of the 
year, and Bernd Niehaus, foreign minister of the outgoing Costa 
Rican Government. 
  Over the past few decades, the OAS has stood on the 
sidelines 
of the main Latin American and Caribbean problems. It has been 
used as an instrument of the successive U.S. Administrations 
against Cuba, and after a brief period when it seemed to have 
regained the path of respect for self-determination and for the 
legitimate governments of each nation, it yielded again to U.S. 
pressure and aligned itself with the one-sided idea of presuming 
the traditional representative democracy to be the sole legal 
system. 
  However, OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares in public 
remarks has reaffirmed that Cuba should not be absent from this 
organization. 
  The elections that will be held tomorrow have prompted the 
emergence of contradictions within the organization. Costa Rica, 
which has maintained a policy too tied to Washington in the 
recent past, has had some disputes with the United States over 
the issue of expropriations and over the seizure of a U.S. 
fishing boat within Costa Rican jurisdictional waters. Now it is 
directly accusing Washington of pressuring countries which have 
promised to support Niehaus. 
  Niehaus himself had said that it is a battle of a group of 
small countries against the large and strong countries. He 
recalled -- quoting his words -- that if we are to say that the 
OAS's task is to defend democracy, how can it be that its 
secretary general is elected in an antidemocratic manner, 
disregarding the free will of the majority, using the mechanism 
of pressure? 
  U.S. pressure was precisely what led the OAS to a total loss 
of credibility. Absent from the main conflicts on the continent, 
because of U.S. pressure, it is no surprise to anyone that the 
OAS today is engulfed in this type of difficulty when it is 
choosing a new secretary general, giving heed to denunciations 
made by Niehaus, who had also supported the U.S. policy of 
exclusion and alignment.

<F P=106> [By Ramon Melenciano] </F>
  [Text] Santo Domingo, 26 Mar (EFE) -- Although the 
Dominican Republic has officially voiced support for Costa 
Rica's candidate for the post of OAS secretary general, today, 
just one day before the elections, it is still unknown how the 
Dominican Government will vote. 
  Dominican Republic President Joaquin Balaguer has expressed 
a 
need for the regional organization to be reorganized to enable 
it to fulfill its duty of being the guardian of Latin American 
democracy. This position corresponds with the one proposed by 
the group of nations supporting the candidacy of Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria. Balaguer also stated that, together 
with Argentina President Carlos Menen, he is participating in 
Latin American efforts to restore the prestige of the OAS. 
  Previously, Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral and 
Foreign Ministry officials had told EFE that the Dominican 
Republic would support Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd 
Niehaus. The support was based on the fact that Costa Rica is a 
small country, as well as on an agreed rotation for 
representatives from all OAS countries to occupy the post of 
secretary general. 
  Ambassador Kemil Dipp Gomez, who heads the United Nations 
and 
OAS Department at the Dominican Republic's Foreign Ministry, 
said the Dominican Republic would maintain its support for Costa 
Rica even if there was a possibility that Niehaus could be 
replaced by Oscar Arias, former Costa Rican president and Nobel 
Peace Prize laureate. Niehaus is running against Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria, who has the support of the United 
States, Mexico, and Brazil. 
  In January and March 1994, Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi 
Sanin visited the Dominican Republic in an effort to obtain the 
government's support for Gaviria's candidacy. On both 
occasions, however, Dominican Republic diplomatic officials 
reiterated their country's preference for a representative from 
a small country, such as Costa Rica, to occupy the post of OAS 
secretary general. Therefore, Balaguer's statements have 
confused international diplomats as to which of the two 
candidates, Gaviria or Niehaus, will receive the Dominican 
Republic's support. 
  According to a source within the Dominican Republic Foreign 
Ministry, there are two international policy issues that could 
force the government to withdraw its support for Costa Rica in 
favor of Colombia. The first is that the United States, the 
country that has the most political influence and economic 
relations with the Dominican Republic, supports Gaviria. At 
this time, the Dominicans are promoting bilateral agreements 
with the United States, which, according to the source, could 
sway the Dominican Republic's vote in favor of Gaviria. 
  The other factor is that the Dominican Republic and Colombia 
are negotiating the possible release of four Dominicans jailed 
in Santa Fe de Bogota in connection with an alleged plot against 
the Colombian Government. Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi 
Sanin de Rubio proposed to President Balaguer in her two visits 
that Colombia might agree to allow the Dominicans to serve their 
sentences in their own country if they are convicted, but only 
if the Dominican Republic Government agreed to a 
prisoner-exchange program. Balaguer is being pressured by 
relatives and educational, cultural, and political organizations 
to expedite the release of the Dominicans. 
  After voicing its support for the Costa Rican candidacy for 
more than four months, a change in the Dominican Republic's 
position would be interpreted as meaning that U.S. pressure or 
President Balaguer's interest in obtaining the release of his 
imprisoned citizens prompted the turnaround.

<F P=106> [Communique "to the Mexican people, the peoples and </F>
governments of the world, and the national and international 
media" issued by the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary 
Committee-General Command of the Zapatista National Liberation 
Army (EZLN) on 24 March; place not given; from the "ACIR Radio 
News" newscast -- read by Juan Carlos Santoyo, special 
correspondent in Chiapas] 
  [Text] The Clandestine Indian Revolutionary 
Committee-General Command of the EZLN addresses you to denounce 
the following: 
  1. In the evening of 23 March 1994, we learned by way of a 
radio broadcast of the cowardly assassination of Mr. Luis 
Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, presidential candidate of the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI]. 
  2. The EZLN again explicitly condemns the use of 
terrorism to achieve any end. 
  3. The EZLN deeply deplores the fact that the government 
cannot resolve its internal problems without bloodying the 
people. Federal government hardliners who prefer military 
options hatched and carried out this provocation to annul any 
peaceful attempt at democratizing the country's political life. 
  4. The EZLN notes that Mr. Colosio Murrieta always 
referred to its movement with prudence and respect. His last 
statements indicated he had a clear commitment to compete on 
equal terms with other political forces in the nation. He 
recognized the fact that great injustices exist in the nation, 
and he noted the great distance between the current regime's 
words and the implementation of its economic and social 
policies. Those people whose raunchy voices decry the hope of 
peace, justice, and dignity -- a hope born in the dialogue in 
San Cristobal de las Casas -- have now chosen to sacrifice Mr. 
Colosio Murrieta to signal the disruption of a peaceful 
transition to liberty, democracy, and justice. 
  5. The EZLN knows that this crime which has rocked the 
country is merely a prelude to a large-scale military offensive 
by the federal government against our positions and forces and 
that it marks the beginning of a dirty war against all of those 
honest people who, through different paths, struggle under our 
same banner of peace and dignity. By arguing that it is 
necessary to reinforce the regime to avert actions such as the 
assassination of Mr. Colosio, they attempt to give a political 
and ideological basis to their indiscriminate repression and to 
destroy the cease-fire and, consequently, the dialogue for peace. 
  6. There are clear warning signals that the government is 
preparing an attempt to impose a military solution in the 
Chiapas conflict. On 19 March 1994, the EZLN denounced that 
earlier in the day government aircraft bombed near Comitan and 
Altamirano on the Mendoza highway. Approximately four 
incendiary bombs were dropped by these aircraft, starting fires 
and releasing unusual gases, which makes one think that a dirty 
war has been initiated. 
  7. The EZLN has shown proof of its sincere inclination to 
achieve a just and dignified peace. The government, however, 
has responded with lies, kidnappings, disappearances, threats, 
and bombings. Now, with this barbarous slaying of a public 
figure, its troops are preparing to break the cease-fire. Our 
forces, which are now in the process of holding consultations 
within their communities, have decided on the following step in 
the dialogue for peace and reconciliation: We are now obliged 
to suspend these consultations [ahora nos vemos obligados a 
suspender las consultas] and to prepare ourselves to defend our 
cause and our banner -- the banner of democracy, liberty, and 
justice. 
  8. The EZLN is on red alert. Our troops -- up to our 
last man -- stand ready to defend Zapatist territory. The entry 
points have been mined and our combatants are girding for an 
attack by the government. The uncontrolled access to newsmen, 
which had been part of our policy not to hide anything from the 
eyes of our people, has been canceled. In view of the imminent 
government attack, only the access of war correspondents, duly 
accredited by the EZLN's General Command, will be permitted. 
Any person unknown to our forces who enters our territory will 
be apprehended and thoroughly interrogated. Warning banners are 
waving throughout our territory. The trenches of the Zapatists 
will now be open to all of those who want democracy, justice, 
and liberty. 
  9. Our just struggle is afoot. We are still prepared to 
follow the path of peace. Those who do not want peace are 
trying to return war to Mexican territory -- a war being 
promoted by bad government and its servants. 
  10. The EZLN reiterates to the entire world its 
commitment to respect the cease-fire, not to impede the peaceful 
development of the upcoming elections, and not to stage 
offensive military actions against government forces anywhere 
within national territory under the conditions established in 
our communique of 12 January 1994. If we are attacked, however, 
our forces will defend to the last man the justness of our 
aspirations as Mexicans. If our patriotic history demands more 
bloodshed or that more of our combatants die in the struggle for 
a true peace -- a peace with justice and dignity -- we will not 
hesitate to pay the price. With dignity and courage, the 
faceless will defend the ground in which our dead are buried. 
We will never again return to a land that shames us. We will 
never speak again without showing respect for our words. We 
will continue walking the path of the highest truth, even though 
this may mean death for many of those who defend Zapatism. 
  [Signed] Subcommander Marcos

communique datelined 24 March which the rebel group leadership 
in Chiapas State has been circulating. The communique states 
government airplanes released strange gases and bombed areas 
near the Comitan-Altamirano highway, causing serious fires, at 
dawn on 19 March 1994. The SDN hereby informs the public of the 
following: 
  1. The Secretariat of Defense flatly denies airplanes have 
bombed the area of conflict, because Army and Air Force troops 
have not fired a single shot since 12 January, when the 
president of the Republic ordered a unilateral cease-fire. 
  2. The SDN hereby confirms the pledge made in Press 
Bulletin No. 32 issued on 23 March to the effect troop movement 
in the area of conflict has been strictly administrative. 
  3. The SDN once again offers assurances it will not 
execute actions that may hinder the government's resolve to find 
a peaceful solution to the conflict.

<F P=106> [Proposal issued by the Sandinist National Liberation Front, </F>
FSLN, in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the 
assassination of General Augusto C. Sandino, in Managua, in 
February 1994 -- first paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] To all Sandinists, to all Nicaraguans: Never before 
has Nicaragua experienced such a tragic situation of poverty, 
social exclusion, unemployment, lack of opportunity, the 
plundering of our natural resources, a crisis in moral values, 
corruption, abuse, hopelessness, and lack of a future for young 
people. This crisis, which affects all of society, has created a 
feeling of distrust of the government, public institutions, the 
political parties, and many of their leaders. The Sandinist 
National Liberation Front [FSLN] is by no means exempt from this 
crisis, and we need to recognize this problem if we want to be 
part of its solution. 
  I. The FSLN, as a matter of historic necessity, was born as 
an armed organization to overthrow the Somozist dictatorship. 
After lengthy years of heroic action, dedication, and 
deprivation, it managed to unleash a triumphant insurrectional 
movement that won the support and sympathy of the immense 
majority of the population. Through that heroism, the consensus 
of the majority of the people, the justice of their demands, and 
a broad policy of alliances, we came into power in 1979. 
  II. Since its origin, Sandinism's raison d'etre 
has been the creation of a new society formed of new men and 
women, with new ideals and values, capable of forging, with 
everyone working together, a nation of solidarity, a nation 
without oppression, without egotism, without discrimination or 
exclusionary policies, and in control of its own independence 
and sovereignty. Thousands of Nicaragua's best sons and 
daughters gave their lives for those ideals and values of 
Sandino and Fonseca. 
  III. To carry out its program of deep social 
transformations, 
and given the historic need to promote for the first time the 
interests of the dispossessed masses of the people--the party, 
the state, mass organizations, the armed forces, and the 
security forces were integrated into a single organization of 
power. This system of power also has its ideological foundation 
based on concepts that were new at that time; the FSLN believed 
in its historic destiny as a single vanguard party. 
  IV. Guided by that concept, and in circumstances shaped by 
the war, a style of vertical behavior was created in the party, 
and in the party's behavior in relation to society. That is how 
we acquired the style of an exclusive political group with 
closed membership ranks. 
  V. The sense of social solidarity, of popular mobilizations 
for just causes, the defense of our sovereignty, are values that 
Sandinism nurtured in society. In this way, we brought about 
transformations in Nicaragua's social and economic structures 
despite the aggression sponsored by the Reagan administration, 
which left our economy in ruins. 
  But we also made some grave mistakes in political concepts 
and action that we did not recognize in time. These errors 
reduced the people's support and approval, divided society, led 
to armed clashes, and finally caused us to lose power. 
  VI. The 1990's election defeat left Sandinism without any 
defined sense of direction because its transforming program, 
based upon total power, was no longer possible. Today we are 
still faced with an identity crisis and the lack of a persuasive 
political program with coherent leadership. 
  VII. We should take pride in the fact that our most 
important 
historic legacy is economic and social democracy, whose 
foundation is the transformation of agrarian land ownership, and 
at the same time, representative and participatory democracy. We 
were able to fully and convincingly demonstrate our respect for 
the popular vote when we turned over the government after free 
and honest elections were held. Denying that heritage would mean 
denying our very selves. 
  Based upon the foregoing considerations, it is now becoming 
necessary for the FSLN to accept a new vision of the history of 
Nicaragua and of the contemporary world, so that it will be 
capable of facing the nation's grave social and economic 
problems with lucidity and of taking effective action to defend 
the interests of the vast majority of the people. 
  We Sandinists must dismiss from our minds and hearts all 
those forms of erroneous behavior in which we engaged while we 
held power, and which the people rejected, so that we will not 
repeat them. And we must propose to our party and to society a 
new program, with new options, new democratic forms of 
organization and new forms of popular civic struggle, without 
fear of changes, transformations, and renewal. 
  Therefore, while looking ahead to the FSLN Extraordinary 
Congress, we now offer to the Sandinists and to the people of 
Nicaragua the following proposals for the new Statutes and 
Program: 
  1. Our party must be open, participatory, and creative, with 
flexible structures capable of bringing people together and 
uniting them, and not excluding or dividing. We need to return 
once more to being the party through which the majority of the 
Nicaraguan people, no matter what their economic and social 
status, will feel that they are represented. All closed, 
sectarian, exclusive, and discriminatory attitudes need to be 
rooted out forever from Sandinism, for such attitudes separate 
us from the masses of the people. 
  The requirements for party membership must not be used to 
close doors, but rather to open them, and there must be a single 
class of membership in the FSLN. 
  2. Many Sandinists and sympathizers with Sandinism have 
moved 
away from the party. If we want to win the masses back to us 
once again, we must first learn to motivate all Sandinists so 
they will come back to our ranks. This includes the unemployed, 
who are the most numerous group, and all the others who in rural 
areas and in cities are creating their own way of living both 
through their own initiative and hard work, no matter what their 
occupation, area of interest, profession, or economic and social 
status. 
  3. We must have a party that is truly democratic at all 
levels, with broad areas available for participation, debate, 
and discussion. A party in which elected leaders answer for 
their actions to the people who elected them; a party with a new 
leadership capable of handling the challenges of transformation 
that Sandinism wants. A leadership with new styles, without 
one-man rule systems of any type, that respects the decisions 
made in local organs, and is constantly in touch with the grass 
roots. 
  4. No one wants another war in our country, nor do they want 
violence. Today we Sandinists cannot promote, tolerate, justify, 
or excuse any sort of methods of armed or violent struggle in 
Nicaragua, nor can we be lukewarm in condemning those methods. 
There are many forms of civic struggle and popular mobilization 
that can be used to defend the interests of the majority of the 
people within the framework of our political Constitution and of 
the laws. 
  5. Our political behavior must be based on strict 
consistency 
between what we say and what we do. We cannot go around saying 
one thing and then, behind the scenes, doing something else. Nor 
can we hope to win back the trust of the masses by simply 
changing what we say. Our political speech must always be 
accompanied by consistent political behavior. 
  6. We cannot put off working to find national solutions that 
will lay the groundwork for finding a way to overcome the 
economic and social crisis, which is the common aspiration 
shared by all the Nicaraguan people. In dealing with the 
economic crisis, our critical positions and our alternative 
proposals must be serious, well articulated, and viable. 
  7. The FSLN has legitimate spheres of influence which it 
must 
learn to use to defend the interests of the majority of the 
people: the media, parliament, public opinion forums, municipal 
and regional governments, business associations, unions, 
producers' organizations, and community and social groups. 
  Sandinism must be prepared to work with everybody in the 
fields, in communities, in neighborhoods, in the regions, and in 
cities, in promoting and defending our mutual interests, even 
with those whom in the past we fought during the war. 
  8. A political party's legitimate and necessary aspiration 
is 
to obtain power, and our most important task is to expand and 
recover the consensus of the majority of the people so that we 
can be elected to office. We must remember clearly that we can 
only carry out our political, economic, and social program from 
inside the government. 
  It would be absurd to condemn ourselves to the role of a 
party destined to fight eternally to change things while 
remaining outside in the opposition. In that way a party remains 
locked in frustration and demagoguery. 
  9. The only Sandinism possible is democratic Sandinism. We 
cannot be true to our ideals of economic transformation and 
profound social change without a deep and irreversible 
commitment to democracy. 
  10. Sandinism should carry with pride the banner of honesty 
demonstrated during our exercise of government, honesty which 
promotes nothing but the consequence of the ethical concepts we 
have always championed and defended. We need to reject as 
immoral and contrary to our principles any form of illicit 
enrichment, or any shady deals and acts of corruption, both 
inside and outside our ranks. 
  11. We Sandinists need to keep alive our revolutionary ideal 
of a just and democratic society, a society of solidarity, in 
which no one is humiliated or discriminated against. We need to 
stand firm against all forms of economic and social oppression. 
We need to keep ourselves on the side of a participatory and 
open economic system, in which the poorest and most dispossessed 
are given extra help, and the campesinos are given legal and 
economic guarantees ensuring their rights to land. There will 
never be a Sandinism that defends monopolies, oligarchies (old 
or new), powerful economic groups, whether the old ones or new 
improvised versions, or any form of return to the past of 
economic oppression, no matter who its proponents may be. 
  12. We should proclaim single-mindedly our respect for 
private property and all other legitimate forms of property: 
communal, associative, and cooperative. And we need to state 
clearly our rejection, both now and in the future, of any form 
of confiscation. Economic initiative, whether individual or 
collective, is vital for our national development. 
  13. Neoliberalism is contrary to the social rights and 
interests of the vast majority of the people, who are asked by 
neoliberalism to sacrifice for the benefit of a few of the more 
privileged. We must be forthright in rejecting the dogma of 
neoliberalism, which people have been trying to impose on us 
from outside. The present government has been unable to defend 
Nicaragua's interests from these external impositions by 
international financial organizations. 
  Financial and economic adjustments must fit our real 
situation and should promote production and jobs instead of 
causing stagnation. And just as the dogma that everything should 
be in the hands of the state did not work, a dogma which says 
that everything should be privatized, including public services, 
cannot work. 
  14. We Sandinists should foster the ability of every social 
group, every business association, every union, every community 
organization, every youth and women's group to encourage and 
defend their own common interests, with full independence and 
freedom. This is what participatory democracy means. Democracy 
can only be truly effective when it expands the arenas available 
for popular participation. It is Sandinism's duty to promote the 
role and participation of women in transforming society, while 
respecting the ideas and autonomy of their organizations. 
  15. We need to continue to extend the Atlantic Coast 
Autonomy 
process within the spirit of national unity, and to seek the 
immediate implementation of the autonomy law and the inclusion 
of the functions of autonomous governments as an integral part 
of the constitutional reforms that will have to be debated and 
passed in the National Assembly. 
  16. Today, there is a world of new international relations 
after the end of the Cold War, a world marked by great abysses 
between rich and poor countries, with Nicaragua being one of the 
poor nations. It is our place to work to achieve a just 
international economic order. 
  17. Sandinism, whether in the opposition or in the 
government, cannot harbor undying hostility toward any country. 
Our relations with the United States must be relations of mutual 
respect, but without ever forgetting our tradition as a nation 
that has placed its dignity and sovereignty above all else. 
  This is our message of hope and life. We want to share with 
everyone our aspiration for a prosperous and just Nicaragua, 
without more wars, without poverty, without exclusion, in which 
all Nicaraguans, on a footing of equality no matter what their 
political or religious beliefs or their economic and social 
status, will have the right to live free from fear and to work 
in peace, sure of their lives, of the lives of their families, 
and of their property. 
  We Sandinists, without excluding anyone, must help to create 
an awareness of the future, in a country that really does have a 
future. Our spiritual and material potential, now and in the 
future, is immense. We must turn to the task of helping millions 
of Nicaraguans, especially young people, to recover faith and 
hope in the future. 
  To achieve these desires, which are just and necessary, and 
to take on the challenge of winning the 1996 elections, we must 
at all cost preserve the unity of Sandinism, which is our most 
valued treasure.

<F P=106> [By Luis Enrique Vasquez] </F>
  [Excerpts] Panama City, 27 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Panamanian 
President Guillermo Endara said here today that, with his 
Colombian colleague Cesar Gaviria in the post of OAS secretary 
general, the organization will wake up and become more dynamic 
for the benefit of all people on the continent. 
  "Under the leadership of President Gaviria, we will have a 
new OAS -- one as dynamic as its new secretary general," Endara 
told NOTIMEX in an interview. Endara added that the people of 
the continent will have "a great servant" in Gaviria, who is 
known for his great abilities and charm. 
  Endara said: "The days of the OAS being a somewhat sleepy 
organization have ended. We will truly see a new OAS. I 
congratulate President Gaviria and offer him Panama's full 
support during his tenure." 
  In the past, Panamanian politicians and journalists have 
criticized the American organization for having maintained "an 
extremely submissive" position toward the regime of General 
Manuel Antonio Noriega. In 1989, the Civic Democratic 
Opposition Alliance (ADOC) asked the OAS to issue a resolution 
condemning the Noriega regime and recognizing Endara's triumph 
in the May general elections; this, however, never occurred. 
[passage omitted on Gaviria's biographical data, background 
material on the OAS election] 
  Although Panama's vote was committed to Niehaus last year, 
Endara said Gavira was a "great candidate" to occupy the post. 
"President Gaviria is very suitable for this post," the 
Panamanian president told NOTIMEX over the telephone from his 
presidential residence, where he is resting today. 
  Endara said he urged Niehaus to not feel discouraged by his 
failure to win the post of OAS secretary general, and he also 
urged him to offer his support to Gaviria. 
  "I hope this defeat will not discourage him from continuing 
his great efforts for the sake of the entire continent," Endara 
added.

  [Excerpts] Santiago, 26 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- The Chilean 
Foreign Ministry today denied being pressured by the United 
States or the Rio Group to withdraw its support for Costa Rica 
during Sunday's election of an OAS secretary general. 
  The Foreign Ministry reiterated in a communique Chile will 
vote for the Costa Rican candidate, Foreign Minister Bernd 
Niehaus, in tomorrow's elections to appoint the successor of 
Brazilian Joao Baena Soares. [passage omitted] 
  Representatives for member countries will have to choose 
between Colombian President Cesar Gaviria or Costa Rican Foreign 
Minister Bernd Niehaus, because Venezuela withdrew its candidacy 
this week. [passage omitted] 
  "We have not come under pressure; all we have received are 
the views of several Rio Group foreign ministers," said Chilean 
Foreign Minister Figueroa, who on the afternoon of 25 March 
traveled to the U.S. capital. 
  Figueroa said Chile will "honor" the written pledge signed 
by 
former President Patricio Aylwin and support the Costa Rican 
foreign minister. 
  He said President Eduardo Frei hopes the next OAS secretary 
general will concentrate on resolving the continent's internal 
problems and play an active role in the United States' relations 
with other continents.

  [Text] The presidential campaign of Ernesto Samper and 
Humberto de la Calle is contending that the choice of Luis 
Fernando Ramirez as Andres Pastrana's running mate has taken 
away, once and for all, any banner of pluralism Pastrana wanted 
to give his campaign. 
  Fernando Botero, Samper's campaign manager, believes 
Pastrana 
offered the vice presidency to several Liberals in what he 
called a "cunning electoral maneuver," but none of them were 
willing to side with him. 
  Meanwhile, Humberto de la Calle Lombana, Liberal vice 
presidential candidate, said Ramirez is a young and intelligent 
man, but an absolutely beatable candidate. 
  Samper's official position on the Pastrana-Ramirez slate was 
outlined on 19 March -- the same day the Conservative ticket was 
announced -- through a statement issued by Samper's campaign 
manager. 
  According to the Liberals, the choice of Ramirez should 
generate three reactions from the public. First, Pastrana's 
decision "signifies his own explicit acknowledgment of the huge 
failure of the supraparty strategy he announced with much hoopla 
the day he was nominated." 
  The statement added: "Second, Colombians must be fully aware 
that, by law, Ramirez is unqualified to be a vice presidential 
candidate or, under the very remote chance of a Conservative 
victory in the 8 May elections, to occupy the vice presidency or 
the presidency of the Republic. Without belittling Ramirez's 
personal and professional qualifications, it is more than 
obvious that he was until yesterday a government minister, and 
this obviously makes him ineligible to run for the vice 
presidency." 
  The Samperist viewpoint contends that Colombians now have 
two 
alternatives which radically oppose one another. 
  One alternative is the Liberal ticket which, according to 
Samper, "represents a serious and experienced team that is 
deeply committed to the people and social capitalism." 
  The other one is "the inexperienced Conservative 
Pastrana-Ramirez ticket, which exemplifies fruitless, 
uncontrolled capitalism in the current electoral process." 
  Its conclusion is that "all of this proves that Pastrana is 
unable [biche] to assume the serious responsibilities demanded 
by the Colombian presidency." 
  Ernesto Samper's campaign also asserts that the difficulties 
Andres Pastrana encountered when trying to find a running mate 
convey a lack of leadership and reduce his chances of winning. 
It notes that Pastrana offered the nomination to "many 
Conservative [as published] members," but was unable to get a 
positive answer. 
  Another source said: "The truth is that Pastrana offered 
this 
candidacy to many prominent Liberals, but none would commit to 
this cunning electoral maneuver of hiding a wolf -- a 
Conservative candidacy -- in the sheep's clothes of a Liberal 
vice president." 
  In the eyes of Samper's team, this is the last nail in what 
it calls "the coffin of supraparty sophism that Conservatives 
tried to use to deceive public opinion, which today is 
completely aware of the foundations of the Samper and Pastrana 
candidacies."

  [Text] Caracas, 26 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Today, upon being 
released from prison, Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez, leader of 
the February 1992 coup attempt, announced he will form a 
political organization with rebel officers. The organization 
will be called the 2000 Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement 
[Movimiento Revolucionario Bolivariano 2000 -- a play on the 
name of Chavez's military movement, the 200 Revolutionary 
Bolivarian Movement, which emerged during the 4 February 1992 
coup attempt]. Chavez and 14 lower-ranking officers of the 
Venezuelan Army were released today. They were pardoned by 
President Rafael Caldera who is seeking reconciliation within 
the Armed Forces after the two 1992 coup attempts. 
  Dozens of supporters were waiting for Chavez when he was 
released at the military hospital were he had been held. He 
called on them to search for "the structural changes needed by 
the country" by forming a "wide national front." The Bolivarian 
Movement emerged after the 4 February 1992 military coup attempt 
against then-President Carlos Andres Perez on the grounds that 
Perez's economic adjustment policies were hurting the people. 
Meanwhile, thousands of other supporters gathered outside the 
San Carlos de Caracas military garrison to receive the 14 
officres who participated with Chavez in the coup against Perez, 
whom they accused of being "corrupt and a traitor." 
  Meanwhile, in Peru, General Francisco Visconti, one of the 
leaders of the 27 November 1992 military uprising, announced 
that at least 25 officers who took asylum in that country would 
return to Venezuela to surrender to military justice tomorrow, 
Sunday. With the release of Chavez and the 14 officers, the 
number of people granted presidential pardons, which are part of 
President Rafael Caldera's so-called "pacification policy," has 
risen to 60. With the exception of Gen. Visconti and the 46 
officers who took asylum in Peru, practically all of the leaders 
of the two coup attempts carried out two years ago have been 
released.

<F P=106> [From the "TV Today" newscast; passages within quotation </F>
marks recorded] 
  [Text] This evening, President Cesar Gaviria reportedly has 
the votes he needs to be elected OAS secretary general. 
Nevertheless, diplomatic sources do not believe President 
Gaviria will attain the needed absolute majority of votes during 
the first round of balloting by the OAS foreign ministers. 
  Tomorrow in Washington, 34 OAS member-nations will elect the 
seventh OAS secretary general. Colombian President Cesar 
Gaviria and Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus are the 
strongest candidates to replace Brazilian Joao Baena Soares as 
secretary general. 
  [Soares] "The most important thing for me is to complete my 
term in office by following the principles I established for 
myself from the very beginning." 
  On the eve of the elections, President Gaviria seems to be 
leading. Gaviria has the support of 16 countries, three more 
than his closest opponent -- Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus. 
  [Niehaus] "There are no blocs, and there are no secret 
commitments. We are only committed to ensuring respect for the 
OAS Charter." 
  To win the election, a candidate must receive an absolute 
majority of all votes cast -- in other words, 18 votes to keep 
the election from going to a second round. 
  [Former Colombian Foreign Minister Augusto Ramirez Ocampo] 
"If logic prevails, President Gaviria will win. Gaviria is a 
president, whereas Niehaus is a foreign minister. Gaviria also 
has the support of the largest countries on the continent." 
  Whoever the winner is, he will face the great challenge of 
reviving what many international analysts have described as a 
moribund organization. 
  [Analyst Diego Uribe Vargas, identified by caption] 
"Whenever 
it can, the United States disregards inter-American laws and 
principles, beginning with nonintervention, which is the first 
and foremost rule." 
  Experts say the new secretary general must bolster the OAS 
profile, making it stronger in the face of the U.S. Government. 
Many believe the OAS is excellent in theory, but that does not 
work in practice. 
  [Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin] "The new secretary 
general must have the discipline and commitment to work for 
everyone while excluding no one, especially those that need help 
the most." 
  This evening the Colombian foreign minister was working hard 
to ensure the votes of two undecided countries to lock up the 18 
votes needed by President Gaviria.

<F P=106> [Speech by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria from Narino </F>
Presidential Palace in Santa Fe de Bogota marking his election 
as OAS secretary general; broadcast in progress--live] 
  [Text] ...it has been confirmed a Colombian has been 
elected to the post of OAS secretary general. The ideals of 
Bolivar, Jefferson, Marti, Juarez, Morazan, San Martin, and all 
those who fought to make America a great nation compel us to see 
this commitment as the continuation of our liberator's task. In 
addition, we see it as a recognition of the common identity and 
joint ideals of all Americans. They also compel us to receive 
it as an expression of friendship for and trust in a modern and 
renewed Colombia, something that fills us with pride and 
gratitude. 
  The community of American nations has considered the 
modernization of our institutions, renewal of our social, 
economic, and commercial structure, and expansion of political 
and civil rights; in sum, the commitment and effort to put 
Colombia in step with the times. With the support of all, we 
will devote ourselves to the task of starting a new era in 
hemispheric relations. 
  You can rest assured that since we accepted the nomination, 
we clearly understood what would entail the challenge of 
redesigning the future of the inter-American system. We have an 
unyielding and firm commitment to integration. We wish peace, 
democracy, protection of human rights, justice, and liberty. We 
hope for the expansion of commerce and economic welfare. These 
aspirations will undoubtedly strengthen the American union and 
will be put at the service of the unavoidable and collective 
destiny of all our peoples. 
  My commitment. Under current circumstances it is to serve 
the continent. The time has come in which the OAS has ahead of 
it the responsibility of setting new paths within the context of 
a changing world, which is demanding the articulation of new 
international relations, more egalitarian, with more solidarity 
and a higher awareness of the capacities and needs of every 
region. 
  This is one of those rare moments in history in which we are 
called to respond with courage and creativity to a great 
opportunity. The Cold War is over. It is not sufficient to 
talk of a new world order; in fact, this is unavoidable. Our 
challenge is to mold it so that the initial euphoria, which has 
vanished now, will generate hope and a clear path instead of 
yielding to uncertainty and confusion. 
  I will promote an integrating OAS that joins, unites, 
complements, and turns into the catalytic agent that joins the 
processes and initiatives of economic liberation and commercial 
integration the hemisphere is experiencing. 
  The Bolivarian dream of unity should also be reflected in 
the 
creation of a great free trade zone that links the immense 
territories from Alaska to Patagonia and shows the world the 
greatness of an America that supports itself in its untold 
resources and its multiethnic and multicultural nature. From 
that prostrate America with an outstretched hand that regretted 
its own destiny, we have witnessed a birth, a new and second 
opportunity, a new hemisphere that is demanding solidarity and 
cooperation, equitable commerce, and development and struggles 
against poverty for the sake of equality and dignity. 
  A conjunction of interests has been born, filled with 
autonomy and values, proud of itself and assured of its future, 
which is already holding fluid and dynamic talks with the 
European Union, the Asia of the Pacific Basin, Africa, and other 
world regions. They, the Americas and the Caribbean, recognize 
the virtues of mutual cooperation, the need to take 
everywhere--on islands and the mainland--the progress and 
benefits of new and productive alliances for development. 
  The new OAS will preserve, defend, and reinforce the 
prevalence of human rights, democracy and its freedoms, while 
respecting the identity, aspirations, and path chosen by each 
people who will have in the OAS an unconditional ally in the 
defense of their institutions. Today more than ever, our 
countries are legitimizing their institutions, reaffirming their 
democracies, and proclaiming new constitutions which reiterate 
the American ideal of freedom, justice, and equality. 
  We plan to transform the OAS into a major forum in which 
every nation, especially those truly in need, will be able to 
discuss their cultures, achievements, and concerns, as well as 
their living conditions, in such a way that it will enrich 
cooperation agreements with our hemisphere. This will enable us 
to advance together as one, without differences or disputes. 
Our primary concern lies in coming closer together with each 
passing day and moving toward equitable and dignified standards 
of living for all of our brothers in the Americas. 
  Our natural resources -- including the Latin American 
environment that stretches from the tundra, across seas and 
rivers, all the way to the pampa -- are entitled to our best 
efforts to ensure their protection and conservation. It is our 
responsibility to our children and history to exhaust all means 
possible to prevent deterioration or uncontrolled exploitation. 
  In terms of my predecessor Joao Baena Soares, in the name of 
the three Americas and the Caribbean, I would like to 
acknowledge his relentless efforts over the past 10 years to 
uphold this organization's leadership and to transform it into a 
forum committed to consultation, overcoming difficult situations 
created by new and fragile democracies. All of these efforts 
required a man of his temperament and his knowledge. 
  To my opponent, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, 
as well as to all of the other candidates -- of which I must 
mention Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas 
and Mr. Carlos Iturralde from Bolivia -- I would like to express 
my appreciation for their taking part in this outstanding and 
first-rate debate, which will undoubtedly enrich our future 
ideas. The final vote shows a willingness to unite and to move 
in a direction which, I dare say, demands we head toward action 
and renewal. 
  To my Colombian compatriots, I urge all of you to continue 
providing your support, because this new phase of the OAS 
represents both a victory and a commitment for us, as both 
Colombians and as Americans. Our Foreign Relations Ministry 
headed by Minister Noemi Sanin Rubio, who has conducted her 
duties with professionalism, devotion, and patriotism, deserves 
a warm acknowledgement from all of Colombia. Our diplomatic 
corps in Washington, the Americas, the Caribbean, and throughout 
the world, as well as all of those officials working abroad for 
the good of Colombia, have performed in a praiseworthy manner. 
Thanks to all of these people, our country will accept this 
honorable appointment which the president will receive once the 
constitutional regulations governing this matter are met and his 
mandate concludes on 7 August 1994 -- the date up until which I 
will direct Colombian's destiny as part of my official duties. 
  Alberto Lleras Camargo, the first OAS secretary general, 
interpreted the organization's commitment to integration, 
democracy, and progress with these words: We intend to transform 
the hemisphere into man's worthy sanctuary, employing his best 
attributes, and defending his liberty. This is our commitment 
also, just as it was yesterday, and just as it will continue to 
be tomorrow. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Victor Alarcon, Caracol Colombian </F>
correspondent in Washington, DC, by unidentified reporter in 
Santa Fe de Bogota--live relay] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Victor Alarcon is our special 
correspondent. What happened with the speech by Costa Rican 
Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus? In Colombia, we are interested 
in learning the reaction. What happened? 
  [Alarcon] We are reporters, not diplomats; so we have to say 
the speech by the Nicaraguan foreign minister was rude. 
  [Reporter] Nicaraguan or Costa Rican? 
  [Alarcon] Pardon me, Costa Rican. 
  [Reporter] Niehaus. 
  [Alarcon] Mr. Niehaus. Pardon me. 
  [Reporter] That is fine. 
  [Alarcon] The speech was rude and arrogant. It was 
prompted, perhaps, by the agony of defeat. He called those 
countries colonies of an imperialist, namely, the United States. 
He said the best thing would be for the United States to 
handpick the new OAS secretary general. He withdrew irately 
from the hall, where the session continues. 
  The Argentine foreign minister spoke next to ask the 
assembly 
not to pay attention to the Costa Rican foreign minister's 
remarks, which were uttered in the agony of defeat. Those in 
attendance took that advice more seriously than Niehaus' 
statements. 
  The assembly continues. We will enter the assembly to be 
close to Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin, to carry her first 
reaction, given the fact she handled this campaign. She was 
truly the architect of the campaign of Cesar Gaviria Trujillo, 
who was elected the new OAS secretary general this morning.

  [Text] Washington, D.C., 27 Mar (DPA) -- Costa Rican 
Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus today angrily condemned the OAS 
members who reneged on their promise to back his bid for 
election as new OAS secretary general. Colombian President 
Cesar Gaviria won the election. 
  Niehaus said: Costa Rica "views as very worrisome the little 
respect that certain member states have demonstrated in these 
elections to acquired commitments." 
  He said: "Costa Rica on several opportunities listed the 
expressed backing it had, backing which was formalized in line 
with the most strict norms of diplomacy. At the polls there 
were some who simply discarded their word and honor, however, 
without showing Costa Rica the most elemental consideration of 
saying they were going to withdraw their support." 
  In leaving OAS Headquarters, Niehaus said until the last 
minute he had written promises of support from 21 countries, but 
received the votes of only 14. The original coalition included 
the six Central American countries, the 13 Caribbean 
English-speaking countries, and four South American countries. 
  Ecuador and Antigua and Barbuda, which had promised to 
support Niehaus, publicly announced before the voting they were 
going to back Gaviria, but because the voting was secret it was 
not possible to establish what other countries concealingly 
changed their votes at the moment of voting. 
  Niehaus accused the United States, not mentioning the 
country 
by name, due to its pro-Gaviria campaign. Niehaus accused it of 
"exerting pressure and resorting to all sorts of mechanisms and 
antics to force others into changing their votes." 
  He complained: "If this continues to be the OAS norm, it 
seems it would be better to forget formalisms and just allow the 
country at issue to continue to directly appoint the heads of 
all the posts. At least in this way we would be saving time, 
effort, rhetoric, and poetry about the respect accorded to 
states' sovereignty." 
  Niehaus said reproachingly: "We must always remember, 
however, a colony-type attitude by the weak is worse than an 
imperialist attitude by the powerful."

<F P=106> [By Maria Luisa Azpiazu] </F>
  [Excerpts] Washington, 27 Mar (EFE) -- Costa Rican Foreign 
Minister Bernd Niehaus, who ran against Colombian President 
Cesar Gaviria for the post of OAS secretary general, today 
struck a discordant note in an assembly which, in the end, 
congratulated itself for choosing "the best candidate." 
  Niehaus, who in fact congratulated Gaviria, who defeated him 
20-14 in a secret vote, delivered one of the most resentful 
speeches heard at the OAS within the past few years. 
  According to what EFE could confirm in the hallways, 
although 
the speech did not diminish the organization's satisfaction over 
Gaviria's election, it took everyone by surprise, given the 
harshness of its vocabulary and the severity of its criticism, 
which at times teetered on being incredulously undiplomatic. 
  Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin termed Niehaus' 
speech 
"an emotional reaction," while, for instance, her Ecuadoran 
colleague, Diego Paredes, considered it "unfair and hardly 
elegant" and "a bad end to a good campaign." 
  Meanwhile, Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella 
disputed 
many of Niehaus remarks, recalling that "in a democracy, one 
must learn how to lose." Di Tella said he believed that 
Niehaus' criticism about being discriminated against "was 
extremely harsh and cannot be accepted." Even so, Di Tella 
stressed, "one must not place great importance on statements 
made in the din of defeat." 
  According to one South American diplomat who asked to remain 
anonymous, Niehaus "did not keep anything to himself, and, in 
his attempt to shake the structures, no one escaped his 
admonishment unscathed." 
  According to Niehaus, what occurred today "creates deep 
doubts over the alleged right every state has to aspire to posts 
within the inter-American system." 
  In his opinion, small countries "are denied access to the 
post of secretary general." He affirmed that in the OAS "large 
countries are first-class members, and, although they are fewer, 
they feel they should impose their will and criteria on 
countries they deem second-class members." This "hurts the 
system," Niehaus continued. 
  Later, Niehaus accused some OAS member-nations of showing 
"little respect" for the "commitments made" and, despite having 
promised to support Costa Rica, "they did not honor their word 
and integrity, without even having the consideration to advise 
the Costa Rican Government they would withdraw their support." 
  Within this context, the Costa Rican foreign minister 
assured 
that within the OAS "it will be difficult to ever again believe 
in a vote commitment." He added, "It is ironic that the OAS 
dispatches electoral observers to every corner of the 
hemisphere, and yet, within its own internal elections, it 
cannot guarantee that ethics and respect for prior commitments 
are observed." 
  Moreover, Niehaus went beyond simply criticizing OAS 
member-states in general, and, while referring to the United 
States without naming it, he contended it was "inadmissible and 
regrettable" that there are countries that "disregard the most 
basic respect for foreign decisions, devoting themselves to 
exerting pressure and resorting to all kinds of mechanisms and 
nuances to force others to swing their votes." [passage omitted] 
  Niehaus walked out of the room before the special assembly 
presided over by Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa 
concluded. 
  [Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish at 2219 GMT on 27 March 
carries a 350-word report on the reaction of Costa Rican 
officials to Cesar Gaviria's 27 March election as OAS general 
secretary. Niehaus is quoted as saying in his speech that he 
wants to "ask OAS member-nations to reflect seriously on some of 
the issues that have come up in this election and what they 
might signify for the future of the Inter-American system." He 
says that the large member-nations of the OAS feel "it is their 
duty to impose their will and criteria on those nations they 
regard as second-class." NOTIMEX also says Niehaus "deplored 
the fact that some countries `cast their votes overboard,' 
alluding to those nations that initially voiced support for him 
but later withdrew this support when it came time to vote."]

  [Text] Washington, 27 Mar (EFE) -- Shortly after Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria was elected to the post of OAS secretary 
general today, Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin declared 
that now the election is over, "We are a single America, working 
united." 
  In statements to EFE, Sanin emphasized the "profound" 
importance of every country that took part in the vote. She 
stressed that, for Colombia, "there is no difference between 
those who voted for or voted against us." 
  In the Colombian foreign minister's opinion, we are now "an 
entire hemisphere working united, in solidarity, for the most 
noble of causes -- the defense of democracy, the fight against 
poverty, and the safeguarding of all opportunities that arise, 
including those opportunities to promote free trade." 
  Sanin said that after she advised President Gaviria of the 
result of the election -- 20-14 in favor of Gaviria over his 
opponent, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus -- the 
president asked her to express to his "gratitude and 
recognition" to all parties, as well as to convey his "highest 
praise to Joao Clemente Baena Soares for his performance in the 
post." 
  The foreign minister, however, was more ambiguous when 
discussing the post-election speech delivered today by Foreign 
Minister Niehaus -- a very emotional speech that criticized some 
of the proceedings which, in his opinion, discriminated against 
the small countries. Foreign Minister Sanin limited herself to 
merely saying that this speech appeared to be "an emotional 
reaction."

<F P=106> [Report by Jesus Garzon from the "TV Today" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Cesar Gaviria's election as OAS secretary 
general did not come easily. There were dramatic moments that 
jeopardized it throughout the process. Foreign Minister Noemi 
Sanin had to use all of her strengths to win the OAS Secretariat 
General for Colombia: 
  [Begin Sanin recording] There was a time when Foreign 
Minister Niehaus was leading. There was tension all the time. 
We, however, remained confident we would win, and finally, we 
garnered an absolute majority. [end recording] 
  The days leading up to the election also featured dramatic 
moments that were witnessed by many, from President Gaviria at 
Narino Palace to the Colombian delegation in Washington headed 
by Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin. 
  [Begin Sanin recording] We contained our anxiety while we 
confronted challenging moments over the past few days. We held 
countless talks on a daily basis. There were concerns, 
questions, and ideas; there were... [pauses] We had to outline 
our policies on countless occasions. [end recording] 
  Now that Gaviria has been elected, the question is whether 
he, as the new OAS secretary general, will work to lift the 
suspension that this organization imposed on Cuba in 1962 
because of its political system. 
  [Begin Sanin recording] Colombia's current policy toward 
Cuba 
is sovereign and independent and is solely in keeping with 
Colombia's interests. President Gaviria's OAS policy should not 
follow Colombian policy but a policy common to the 34 nations 
that comprise the organization. [end recording]

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports from regional sources on reaction from various Latin 
American officials and politicians to the 27 March election of 
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo as OAS secretary 
general. 
<H5>  Colombia </H5>
  Several Colombian presidential candidates have commented on 
President Cesar Gaviria's election to the post of OAS secretary 
general. AD/M-19 (19 April Movement Democratic Alliance) 
presidential candidate Antonio Navarro Wolff said he hopes 
Gaviria will act "independently and will actually serve as an 
OAS secretary instead of U.S. State Department secretary." 
Meanwhile, presidential candidate Enrique Parejo noted that the 
president's responsibility as head of the nation's foreign 
policy was inconsistent with his role of promoting his own 
candidacy as OAS secretary general. Presidential hopeful Miguel 
Maza Marquez congratulated Gaviria on his election victory, but 
he warned that regional "pro-integration policy" could be 
adveresly affected by Gaviria's election. (Santa Fe de Bogota 
Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 1800 GMT 27 Mar 94) 
  Ernesto Samper, Liberal Party presidential candidate, today 
said in Santa Fe de Bogota that the OAS member-states' support 
for President Gaviria could help rid Colombia of an image 
tainted by violence and drug trafficking. Samper explained: 
"With this election, the countries have recognized Colombia's 
ability to lead on a hemispheric level." Samper noted Gaviria 
"will do an excellent job to strengthen the OAS." Meanwhile, 
Conservative Party Presidential Candidate Andres Pastrana Arango 
said the results of the OAS election represent "a recognition of 
Colombia's value within regional political processes." (Mexico 
City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1836 GMT 27 Mar 94) 
<H5>  El Salvador </H5>
  Salvadoran leftist and rightist groups today called the 
election of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria as OAS secretary 
general "positive." Joaquin Villalobos, one of the main leaders 
of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), said 
the election of the Colombian president "is a positive sign." 
He said Gaviria's election "established the need for Central 
America to continue moving down the path of intergration to 
defend its interests as a united region." Meanwhile, ARENA 
(National Republican Alliance) Deputy Rene Figueroa told NOTIMEX 
that Gaviria's election will bring "new brilliance and dynamism 
to the OAS." He predicted that, under a Gaviria administration, 
relations with the United States will be more cordial. (Mexico 
City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2237 GMT 27 Mar 94) 
<H5>  Guatemala </H5>
  Jose Luis Chea, secretary general of Guatemala's Democratic 
Union, today said the election of Colombian President Cesar 
Gaviria as OAS secretary general demonstrates that large 
countries, such as the United States, continue to impose their 
will on the OAS. Chea, former president of the Group of 77, 
told ACAN-EFE that Gaviria's election demonstrates that "only 
large countries are permitted to hold the post of OAS secretary 
general." He concluded by saying the election only proves the 
United States is maintaining its influence over the OAS. 
(Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1646 GMT 27 Mar 94) 
<H5>  Nicaragua </H5>
  Nicaraguan Deputy Foreign Minister Jose Pallais said Central 
America has once again had its hopes of guiding the OAS dashed. 
He said, "We are very pleased with the outcome, although 
Central America will continue to aspire to this post, despite 
the fact that this end could not be accomplished at this time." 
Meanwhile, Sandinist Carlos Tunnermann, Nicaragua's former 
ambassador to the OAS, told ACAN-EFE that Cesar Gaviria "will 
inject" dynamism, prestige, and experience into the OAS. 
Commenting on the defeat of Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd 
Niehaus, Tunnerman said, "the time will come" when Central 
America "will have a candidate that will receive the support" of 
the other countries in the hemisphere. (Panama City ACAN in 
Spanish 1855 GMT 27 Mar 94) 
<H5>  Central America </H5>
  Commenting on the election of Colombian President Cesar 
Gaviria as OAS secretary general, Danilo Roca, member of the 
Political Commission of the Central American Parliament, has 
declared that the United States supported Gaviria to pay him 
back for killing Pablo Escobar and waging a successful war on 
drugs. Roca also contended that Costa Rican Foreign Minister 
Bernd Niehaus' defeat resulted from Costa Rica wavering in its 
integrationist policy. Meanwhile, the Labor and Popular Action 
Union of Guatemala called on the OAS to become a mechanism that 
will contribute to creating a new international community based 
on peace, solidarity, and development. Former Guatemalan 
President Vinicio Cerezo expressed his "satisfaction" with 
Gaviria's election. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2250 GMT 27

  [Text] Brasilia -- The 12 Latin American and Caribbean 
countries that are Rio Group members are negotiating a joint 
strategy for multilateral meetings. The main objective is to 
agree on a position for the Summit of the Americas, due to be 
held in December in Miami (United States). According to 
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, the Rio Group foreign 
ministers should agree on common topics about commerce in the 
hemisphere, good management practices, the preservation of 
democracy, and social and environmental matters. The decision 
was announced on 22 March after the Rio Group countries' foreign 
ministers met for two days in Brasilia. 
  Amorim and Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa Serrano 
took advantage of the meeting to sign an agreement for 
reciprocal protection and promotion of investments. Under the 
terms of the document, the two countries will permit the mutual 
free transfer of remittances. The agreement, however, includes 
reservations on six topics -- which were raised by Brazil -- to 
encourage Brazilian investment and restrict Chilean investment. 
  The foreign ministers also began the preparatory work for 
the 
Rio Group summit, scheduled for September in Rio de Janeiro. 
Celso Amorim said the Latin American diplomats also will seek a 
common position for a meeting with the European Union scheduled 
for 22 and 23 April in Sao Paulo. According to Amorim, Latin 
American countries will make joint exchange proposals to Russia, 
China, Japan, and other Asian countries.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Al Gore's Visit"] </F>
  [Text] Relations between Argentina and the United States 
gained new momentum following the U.S. vice president's brief 
visit to Buenos Aires on the second leg of his tour of three 
South American countries. Al Gore's praises of the Argentine 
economic policy before his arrival -- reiterated upon his 
departure -- coincide with a growing degree of understanding in 
other areas, like cooperation between the United States and 
Argentina in operations undertaken by the international 
community. 
  These bonds between the two countries enable them to openly 
discuss matters of common interest. Gore raised two issues that 
the Reagan and Bush Republican administrations already had 
deemed a priority, namely the law on patents -- strictly 
speaking, on intellectual property -- and the fight against 
drugs. 
  With regard to patents, Gore reiterated what U.S. Trade 
Representative Michael Kantor stated not long ago -- that 
Washington gives top priority to the passing of a law that 
guarantees foreign pharmaceutical companies' rights to the 
patents they have obtained for their medicines. As for drug 
enforcement -- which will be one of the main agenda items at the 
summit of the Americas' heads of state in Miami this year -- the 
United States continues to uphold the advisability of Latin 
American armed forces playing some role in this area. 
  President Carlos Menem conceded that a delay in the 
enactment 
of the patents law may be a stumbling block in bilateral 
relations. He commented on the possibility -- previously 
mentioned by Kantor -- of Argentina being included on a list of 
countries liable for economic sanctions. This could happen if 
considerable progress has not been made in this respect by 30 
April. Menem also referred to another possible negative 
consequence in the future, namely, the indefinite postponement 
of Argentina's joining NAFTA, whose only current signatories are 
the United States, Canada, and Mexico. 
  It would be totally erroneous to interpret the tone of these 
warnings as proof of a misunderstanding between both countries. 
The Patents Bill already has been submitted to Congress and 
even though some of its points -- which to some extent affect 
local vested interests -- have been met with opposition, there 
is no reason to doubt it will be approved. Argentina's stance 
-- like other countries in the hemisphere -- on the struggle 
against drug trafficking is different from that of the United 
States as far as the Armed Forces' possible role in this area, 
but both countries are totally of one mind with regard to the 
final objectives and the coordination of efforts. 
  The U.S. vice president's visit enabled the Argentine 
Government to once again protest -- and quite understandably so 
-- U.S. subsidies for their agricultural exports. Once again, 
the answer was that Washington has no intention whatsoever of 
damaging "legitimate" exporters like Argentina and that 
subsidies are a response to EC practices. Obviously, this 
position does not satisfy Argentina at all, but it spells out 
the policy furthered by the United States, which also contends 
that the issue of subsidies to farmers must be discussed within 
the framework of GATT negotiations and cannot be settled 
bilaterally. 
  The wide coverage given to the differences over these 
questions clouded what -- at least in speeches -- constituted 
the reason for the vice president's visit: the arrangement of 
the December presidential summit in Miami and his presentation 
at the World Conference on Telecommunications Development. 
Gore's presentation on a future "information superhighway," 
which will link data banks in the entire hemisphere, conjured up 
visions of a not far-off future on which they are working 
unstintingly. It would be wise to pay attention to this project 
and get ready for what will seemingly mark the beginning of a 
new era, in which communications developments will impose a new 
rhythm to relations between nations in the Americas.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Oscar Raul Cardoso; copyright CLARIN] </F>
  [Text] Without the dark clouds that during most of this 
century represented the most constant characteristic of 
Argentine-U.S. relations, the brief visit to Argentina that U.S. 
Vice President Albert (Al) Gore yesterday began paying should be 
like a diplomatic minuet, with reciprocal, delicate praise and 
assurances. Though this prediction might seem a self-fulfilling 
prophecy, unless there are unforeseen factors, it would be a 
mistake to believe that relations with the United States are 
totally devoid of major question marks. In fewer than five 
years the big disagreements have disappeared, at least for the 
foreseeable future, after the Carlos Menem government explicitly 
decided to abandon successive policies (neutrality in 
international conflicts, nuclear and missile development, 
objections to the world's economic order, and so forth) -- 
policies upon which Argentina has historically built the various 
levels of its relative independence. 
  Yet while the overestimated ghost of Condor-2, or the 
threat, 
which has never been quite serious, of a nuclear proliferating 
Argentina, or of a country in default with the international 
financial system, have faded in the strange post-cold war 
atmosphere, there are at least three areas in which the two 
countries can disagree. 
  -- International trade is today the most sensitive area. 
Through its efforts to adjust its economy to the demands of 
capitalism, Argentina has become the country in the hemisphere 
that is most strongly committed to the neoliberal model. In 
order to make this bitter medicine easier to swallow, Argentina 
bet strongly on the still unfulfilled promises of having access 
to productive investment, and of a free and rational economic 
order with a minimum level of equitability. Based on Menem's 
interpretation of the international situation, the two phenomena 
should occur under the leadership of the United States, the only 
superpower that survived the old order after the collapse of the 
socialist alternative. The U.S. power, however, is concentrated 
in the military sector, while its economic power has been 
fragmented and has been transferred from the states to the 
corporations, which are ruled by the ideology of big, fast 
profits. Old certainties, like the ones provided by the Bretton 
Woods system, have disappeared. In a recently published article 
Godman Sachs International Vice President Robert Hormats said 
that the truth is that the industrialized countries have not yet 
made the strategic decision to incorporate the 3 billion 
inhabitants of Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Asia into an 
authentically open global economy and an authentically open 
international financial system. The administration of Bill 
Clinton last year attached strategic priority to the commercial 
issue by implementing the North American Free Trade Agreement 
with Canada and Mexico (NAFTA) and by signing the GATT accord. 
But after attaining both objectives the Clinton administration 
has remained on guard, lying in wait for conflict, threatening 
Japan with the legislation known as Super 301, which contains 
all the arbitrariness imaginable, as well as the political 
weapons for a hot commercial war. 
  -- Also regarding the economy, the United States still has, 
with respect to Argentina and also to other countries of the 
region, additional demands concerning rules for the increasingly 
critical and intangible intellectual property market (in 
Argentina, this situation is now being reflected by the 
pharmaceutical patents law), and for corruption. The problem of 
corruption has worsened in modern democracies, because it is a 
feature that opposes the concept of justice in the 
sociopolitical system of competitive equality that the market 
should provide. The U.S. case itself is highly illustrative. 
Clinton, who adopted the fight against state corruption as an 
electoral campaign banner and also as a U.S. foreign policy 
priority, is today, along with his influential first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, under the public suspicion of illegal 
acquisition of political funds. Even though no specific charges 
have yet been pressed, the matter is being investigated by a 
special prosecutor, and will soon be investigated by Congress. 
At any rate, the Republican opposition seems to have proven -- 
beyond all reasonable doubt -- that Clinton engaged in 
maneuvering to cover up the scandal that has been christened 
Whitewater. 
  -- The problem of drug trafficking and its criminal 
consequences, such as the laundering of money in the enriched 
Latin American financial markets, is another matter that has yet 
to be harmonized by the two countries.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of interview with Economy Minister Domingo </F>
Cavallo by Silvia Pisani and Eduardo De Simone in his office at 
the Economy Ministry; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [LA NACION] You usually say there is pressure 
against you within the government. 
  [Cavallo] This pressure are gradually decreasing. I believe 
the government is becoming increasingly consistent. It has 
learned to work more as a team, to show more solidarity. 
  [LA NACION] Yet the impression remains that someone is 
interested in pitting you against the president, more to affect 
your image than to destabilize your policies. 
  [Cavallo] Not from within the government. The problem in 
Argentina is that press informers and journalists are used as 
instruments in the political struggle. [passage omitted] 
  [LA NACION] Do you believe a political struggle is at the 
root of the problem? 
  [Cavallo] Undoubtedly, I repeat: I am not attacking the 
media. I have a very good opinion of CLARIN and LA NACION 
newspapers. I mention them because they are undoubtedly the 
prestigious and independent media. But I ask myself: Why is the 
press used to lie? 
  [LA NACION] And what is your answer? 
  [Cavallo] It stirs up the system. It makes the solution of 
any problem and the balance of conflictive interests more 
difficult. It can be compared with inflation within the 
economy. It disturbs everything. I am aware this type of 
conflict exists in any nation. When the system of communications 
enables citizens to be informed in a sincere way, it resembles a 
stabilized economy. It is more honest. [passage omitted] 
  [LA NACION] If the president is reelected, will you be his 
economy minister? 
  [Cavallo] I cannot answer that. Only the president can 
answer that. I have demonstrated my vocation to work with him. 
  [LA NACION] And then? 
  [Cavallo] I can say that unless the president fires me, I 
will not abandon him. Those who believe I may leave, slamming 
the door, or threaten to leave are mistaken. This is at odds 
with my personal behavior. I feel extremely responsible as 
Menem's economy minister and I will not jeopardize the success 
of my task over petty or insignificant personal differences that 
I may have to endure. 
  [LA NACION] How is Brazil's proposal applicable to the 
integration of the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and the 
entry into NAFTA? 
  [Cavallo] It is a very intelligent proposal. If we merely 
stick with Mercosur and do not join larger free trade zones or 
negotiate broader free trade agreements, we will be at a 
disadvantage, for example, with Mexico. 
  Brazil's proposal has a significant practical meaning: We 
can 
negotiate free trade agreements using the methods agreed upon 
with other countries. 
  [LA NACION] Would this include a strategy to join NAFTA if 
we 
are unilaterally eligible? 
  [Cavallo] We must always agree on methods of negotiation 
with 
our Mercosur partners. At least, I imagine each country will 
inform its partners. 
  [LA NACION] What will be Argentina's strategy toward NAFTA? 
  [Cavallo] I will not comment on this issue. I may have my 
opinion, but the government must decide. It requires 
negotiation and an exchange of information with the other 
Mercosur partners. 
  [LA NACION] How do you view [Brazilian Finance] Minister 
[Fernando Henrique] Cardoso's economic program? 
  [Cavallo] I concur with it. I believe it represents the best 
way for Brazil to achieve, in the short term, a certain degree 
of stability of its economy and fully regain its growth rate. 
  [LA NACION] Cardoso proposed zero inflation by the end of 
the 
year. Is this possible? 
  [Cavallo] Of course it is possible. In December 1991, after 
just eight months of implementing its economic program, 
Argentina achieved a 0.4-percent inflation rate, that's nearly 
zero inflation. If Argentina achieved this, why not Brazil? 
  It must also be borne in mind that Brazil has achieved 
significant progress in fiscal matters. 
  [Passage omitted] [LA NACION] Will the UCR [Radical Civic 
Union] continue to be the main opposition force? 
  [Cavallo] I believe the UCR will continue to be the main 
opposition party despite its crisis. The UCR's great problem is 
that, following its wise stance on the constitutional reform 
issue, it must explain its change of position. 
  I believe the UCR will overcome this situation. I believe 
Argentina will basically be a bipartisan country with rotating 
governments. One of the parties, namely the Justicialist Party 
[PJ] of the future, will have a more social-Christian, a more 
liberal approach in economic matters. The other party, namely 
the UCR, will have a more social-democratic approach. 
  [LA NACION] What will be the term for this rotation? 
  [Cavallo] Well, Argentina has struck lucky. The UCR, which 
is truly conservative and has great resistance to change, will 
again govern our country when changes are no longer necessary 
because we will already have the appropriate rules and be 
functioning well in political, economic, and social fields. So, 
there is nothing better than a conservative stance like that of 
the UCR to keep things functioning well. Right now a courageous 
party like the PJ, with someone like Menem -- who has a 
straightforward relationship with the people -- is required. 
  Yet when great changes are no longer required, just marginal 
touch-ups, it will probably be time for a more conservative 
force with greater reluctance toward changes and risks -- like 
the UCR. [passage omitted] 
  [LA NACION] There is talk of impending measures to reduce 
costs and encourage exports. What is the plan? 
  [Cavallo] We announced the most significant measures at the 
very beginning and complemented them in early 1991. Since then, 
we merely implemented the announced policies. 
  By 1 March, most agricultural, livestock, industrial, 
mining, 
and construction sectors and part of the tourism sector will 
have received their full tax deductions on payrolls. 
  Within the next few days we will announce details of the car 
imports system for the next five years. This system was devised 
in 1991. It will run for eight years, until 1999 when the 
general rules and regulations will be implemented. We announced 
the import quotas for 1991, 1992, and 1993. We will now 
announce the quotas as of this year. 
  We must accurately determine the repercussions of those car 
companies that did not balance their imports -- under the 
special 2- percent tariff -- with their exports of finished 
vehicles or parts, within the first three years as specified. 
  [LA NACION] The problems are there. What will be done about 
them? 
  [Cavallo] There will be a deficit in compensation 
accumulated 
until mid-1993. This problem has been stopped because we 
authorize the car companies to import under the 2-percent tariff 
only on the basis of their real exports for the preceding month. 
The problem lies in reconciling excessive imports under the 
2-percent tariff against accumulated exports which, in 
principle, the companies are allowed to use in their calculation 
until the end of the year. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Eduardo Barcelona] </F>
  [Text] The government has taken another step to involve the 
Armed Forces in internal intelligence activities, a move that is 
prohibited by the Defense Law. During the second week of March 
there was a secret meeting at the headquarters of the Joint 
Staff that was headed by Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf with 
the participation of the intelligence chiefs of the Armed 
Forces. The social situation was evaluated during the meeting. 
  General Mario Diaz and Hugo Anzorregui, the chief of 
Argentine spies, also participated in the meeting. 
  Secretary General of the Presidency Eduardo Bauza met in his 
office on 7 March with Ruckauf and Defense Minister Oscar 
Camilion. During the meeting, Bauza expressed the president's 
wish for the military to cooperate in the vigilance of the 
country's social aspects following what is known, after the 
events in Santiago del Estero Province and in Mexico, as the 
Chiapas effect. 
  A high ranking Defense Ministry source confirmed to LA 
NACION 
that the meetings did take place, although he made it clear that 
they were not official meetings in which the Armed Forces were 
asked to step in and help in a matter that is banned for them. 
He said that the only subject discussed was "an evaluation of 
the social sector in case the cooperation of the intelligence 
forces becomes necessary. The military provide effective 
logistic support. The military did not report, they listened," 
the official stressed. 
  During the meeting at the headquarters of the Joint Staff, 
for example, an evaluation was made of the type of shield and 
tear gas that the Federal Police used during the 100th march of 
the pensioners in Plaza de Mayo. 
  The first effective blow this year by Menem occurred when he 
called an urgent meeting of the military chiefs at the Olivos 
Residence. The meeting was held on 12 January when the effect 
of Chiapas was still being felt. 
  The four chiefs of the Armed Forces and Ministers Camilion, 
Ruckauf, and Guido Di Tella participated in that meeting. 
  Two days later it was learned that the government had set 
aside 40 million pesos for the purchase of war materiel for the 
police of the provinces and for the Border Guard. 
  On 17 January, Ruckauf announced the creation of a rapid 
deployment force in response to the dangers of a social uprising. 
  Radical Deputy Antonio Berhongaray on 18 March requested 
that 
Camilion and Ruckauf be summoned before the body for questioning 
"regarding the orders that the executive branch has given the 
military intelligence organizations regarding their tasks."

  [Text] Through a document signed on 18 March by Foreign 
Minister Guido Di Tella and his Bolivian counterpart, Antonio 
Aranibar, shortly before Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada ended the visit he paid to Argentina at President Carlos 
Menem's invitation, Argentina and Bolivia agreed to partially 
deregulate the trade of hydrocarbons and their byproducts. 
  In addition, the chiefs of state asked their advisers to 
conduct a two-month study of an agreement authorizing the two 
countries' goods to freely cross their common border, without 
paying customs fees. These goods are to be used in competitive 
manufacturing plants in Bolivia, to be sold in the two 
countries' markets, and to be exported to third countries. 
  This is stated in the long joint declaration that should 
have 
been released on 17 March, but was only released the following 
day. 
  It is stated in the declaration that Bolivia will supply to 
Argentina gas under equal conditions as the gas that is produced 
here, and a binational commission will be created to study the 
situation of Bolivian immigrants. This commission will recommend 
urgent solutions to the problem. 
  It has been learned that Argentina will deem this commission 
a pilot experiment in solving the problems of foreigners 
immigrating from neighboring countries. 
  The agreement on oil establishes overall and reciprocal 
deregulation of import tariffs on crude oil and gas (from 
Bolivia) and oil byproducts (from Argentina) as mentioned in an 
attached list.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with President Gonzalo Sanchez de </F>
Lozada by Roberto Solans on 18 March; place not given] 
  [Text] [Solans] You have said the coca crop, drug 
trafficking, and misery make Bolivia a time bomb. What is your 
strategy to defuse it? 
  [Sanchez] We want to achieve significant growth levels, 
comparable with those of Chile and Argentina through 
capitalization, but with a significant social component. 
  Then comes the people's participation program that makes our 
representative democracy a participative one through the use of 
a great asset of ours; a strong understanding of the community. 
Do not forget that two thirds of our population are Indian 
groups that, unlike western societies, favor the community 
rather than the individual. 
  Taking advantage of this, we want to create a society 
capable 
of achieving significant employment and high social justice 
levels. 
  We are seeking to restore exports. In trade terms, Bolivia 
lost about 90 percent over the past 14 years. We are currently 
exporting drugs and people. 
  [Solans] The agreements that you have just signed with the 
Argentine Government seem to be aimed at achieving this goal ... 
  [Sanchez] They promote investments by both nations [Bolivia 
and Argentina] in my country to establish a raw-material 
processing industry (the processing of national raw materials in 
another country and the purchase of the finished products) that 
will allow us to export lines in which Argentina is no longer 
competitive as a consequence of its high labor costs. This way 
we will export products and not people. 
  This step, along with an increased access to the U.S. 
markets, about which we will ask U.S. Vice President Al Gore 
when he visits La Paz within a few days, should allow us to 
voluntarily eradicate coca crops. 
  [Solans] Is Mercosur [Common Market of the South] one of 
Bolivia's goals? 
  [Sanchez] We are part of the River Plate system and we want 
to be closer because Argentina and Brazil are our great markets. 
We note that Mercosur's dynamics involves expansion, but there 
should me much more opening and honesty. 
  With tariff lists that have more exceptions than uses, I 
believe the honest approach has been neglected. 
  If we are allowed access, NAFTA may lead us into a dynamic 
situation. Bolivia wants to become a bridge between Mercosur 
and the Andean market. 
  [Solans] Concerning your talks with the Argentine 
Government, 
did you receive any response on the immigrants who do not have 
any legal papers? 
  [Sanchez] We talked about establishing a new period for 
Bolivians who already are here to gain legal status. We also 
talked about enforcing new restrictions on the border and making 
entry into Argentina more difficult. 
  Bolivia wants to give more jobs to Bolivians and this is the 
goal of the free trade agreement between the two countries. We 
are attempting to create a relationship similar to the one 
existing between the United States and Mexico. 
  Deploying more guards on the border is no solution because 
barriers vanish with a little corruption. The solution is to 
create jobs in Bolivia and gain access to the Argentine market. 
  [Solans] And the gas sales to our country? 
  [Sanchez] Significant progress has been achieved. We have 
reached agreement on an indefinite, free access in both 
directions of gas and hydrocarbon by-products. We are very 
content with having defined this market. 
  A three-year contract has also been signed in which a price 
list has been established for gas because Argentina is paying 
less than we should receive. The United States, with a 
deregulated economy, is paying almost double. We understand 
that the Argentine economic process does not permit any 
traumatic cost-of-living surges and we will have to follow up on 
this. We trust there will be a gas market here for Bolivia and 
that there will be a market in Bolivia for certain Argentine oil 
by-products. 
  [Solans] What reaction might stem from the Bolivian Armed 
Forces over the impending extradition of former General [Luis] 
Garcia Meza? 
  [Sanchez] None, we believe. We are enforcing a sentence. 
The institutions are not corrupt -- men are. 
  The trial lasted seven years. He has been a fugitive for 
five years. He was discharged from the Armed Forces. It has 
been clearly established in Bolivia that this does not represent 
an attack against an institution, but against a man who has 
seriously damaged it. 
  [Solans] Do the lower echelons also understand it this way? 
  [Sanchez] I believe so. At one time it was clear that a 
group of officers were the culprits. As time went by there has 
been a natural renewal within the Armed Forces and now it is 
understood that this case belongs to the past and justice must 
be meted out. 
  [Solans] And in the political circles? 
  [Sanchez] We don't know. Some people are fearful of what 
Garcia Meza might say. I believe this is not the case, that 
everything was disclosed at the proper time and that, despite 
speculations by the press, there will be nothing new. I believe 
satisfaction prevails because impunity has been punished, 
something that is not usual in our countries. 
  [Solans] Is it true, as some political circles in La Paz 
claim, there are officials in your government who closely 
cooperated with Garcia Meza's regime? 
  [Sanchez] No. Thank God I have no one who was linked to 
drug trafficking or Garcia Meza. Our party was not involved, 
while other parties, for various reasons, were involved in Gen. 
Garcia Meza's project. 
  [Solans] Which ones? 
  [Sanchez] General Hugo Banzer's Nationalist Democratic 
Action. Nevertheless, they moved away when they realized the 
nature of that government.

<F P=106> [Article by Marcia Carmo] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- Determined to ensure that the rules of 
the economic stabilization plan are respected, President Itamar 
Franco yesterday warned that he will not authorize the release 
of funds to "pay illegal salary increases" for the judicial and 
legislative branches. In an exclusive interview with JORNAL DO 
BRASIL, Itamar recognized that the salary dispute among the 
three branches marks the "most worrisome crisis" of his 
administration, clearly establishing that there is confrontation 
among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches -- the 
latter two having approved wage increases that contradict that 
established by Provisional Measure 434 which created the URV 
[Real Value Unit]. 
  "The Chamber of Deputies decision to reject the veto was 
extremely stupid and greatly insensitive," President Itamar 
said. "The judicial branch decision was illegal because it goes 
against the Provisional Measure [PM]." The president said this 
the day after presiding over a tense cabinet meeting, which 
lasted three and a half hours at Planalto Palace. It was 
attended by 14 ministers, including the military ministers. "The 
balance among the three branches has been harmed," the president 
said, recalling the harsh official note he released after the 
meeting. "The current concern is not over the military, but 
over the country," the president said, in an almost hoarse tone 
which is a reminder of his recent flu. 
  President Itamar says the people cannot once again lose the 
chance of defeating inflation due to isolated decisions like 
that of the judicial branch, which would affect the government 
budget and the executive branch's determination to implement the 
salary equity law among the three government branches. This is 
why the president confessed to some friends that this is a 
serious institutional crisis. 
  The president will fight to the bitter end with the judicial 
and legislative branches -- which still requires the Senate to 
approve or reject the presidential veto on the wage increase for 
deputies and senators. That is why yesterday morning he 
announced that he will not release funds for such increases. A 
Government House adviser recalled that Itamar has received 
letters suggesting authoritarian measures and the bringing 
forward of elections. 
  The Federal Supreme Court [STF] decided to convert the 
judicial branch salaries into URV's based on the values valid on 
the 20th of the previous three months instead of on the last 
day. The Federal Administration Secretariat has announced that 
this calculation increases the value of their salaries by 10.9 
percent. 
  The executive branch considers this conversion illegal since 
PM No. 434 clearly establishes that the conversion of public 
employees' salaries must be made based on the URV of the 30th of 
each month. For this reason, President Itamar considers the STF 
administrative decision illegal. The STF says Article No. 186 
of the Constitution establishes that budget allocations for the 
executive and legislative branches must be made on the 20th of 
each month. The issue, according to the president, is that 
salaries are not paid on the 20th.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Having heard the statement of President 
Itamar Franco, Federal Supreme Court [STF] Chairman Luiz Octavio 
Gallotti said he will not argue with him. Gallotti insisted 
that the STF decision to convert wages into URV's on the 20th of 
each month has a constitutional foundation and is strictly under 
the jurisdiction of the STF. 
  "Through the unanimous decision of its members, the STF made 
an administrative decision based on the Constitution. This 
subject exclusively concerns the STF. The STF chairman does not 
want contention with representatives of other government 
branches that are just as independent and who ought to seek 
harmony and not confrontation, seeking respect for the 
constitutional rule of independency and harmony among the 
branches. To obey the Constitution is the best way to preserve 
the credibility of the institutions," Gallotti said. 
  Senate President Humberto Lucena (PMDB-PB) [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party -- Paraiba] and Chamber of Deputies 
President Inocencio de Oliveira (PFL-PE) [Liberal Front Party -- 
Pernambuco] could not be found yesterday. Lucena yesterday 
accompanied Paraiba Governor Ronaldo Cunha Lima to dedicate 
several public works in different municipalities in Campina 
Grande region. Inocencio spent the day on his farms in 
Pernambuco and Maranhao, transferring cattle from Serra Talhada, 
Pernambuco, to the interior of Maranhao.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The 1994 federal budget has become the 
motive of a war between Congress and the executive branch. The 
Joint Budget Committee has released a note of "clarification to 
the nation" in which it denounces the government as the branch 
"exclusively" responsible for the lack of a budget law, directly 
harming the health, education, transport, and agriculture 
sectors. 
  The note is signed by the representatives of eight parties, 
in addition to the committee's president and rapporteur, Senator 
Raimundo Lira (PFL-PB) [Liberal Front Party-Paraiba State] and 
Deputy Marcelo Barbieri (PMDB-SP) [Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party-Sao Paulo State]. Of the country's main parties, only the 
representatives of the PFL and PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party] did not sign the note of criticism. According to one 
congressman, the note was due to the "hasty attitude" of the 
rapporteur. 
  Barbieri stated that the motive behind the note was the 
"overall lack of satisfaction" on the part of the public 
administration with the "penury" of the resources that are 
released by the Treasury. "There are several sectors that are 
functioning precariously, and they visit Congress to complain 
about the lack of funds. The note is to make it clear to the 
government that it has not submitted its proposals for study and 
voting," Barbieri said. According to the deputy, the government 
is "clearly not interested" in approving the budget. "It is 
very easy for the government to constrict resources, but in the 
end it will be even more expensive with an increase in epidemics 
and the closing of hospitals," he said. 
  In Rio de Janeiro, where he spent the day visiting the BNDES 
[National Bank for Economic and Social Development], Planning 
Minister Beni Veras dictated to his adviser an answer for the 
committee. He guarantees that the vital sectors will have their 
resources guaranteed through Provisional Measure No. 441, which 
grants one-twelfth per month of the funds for the sectors 
pertaining to personnel, social charges, pension benefits, 
educational books, scholarships, and the payment of the public 
debt. He also states that the payments to hospitals that have 
an agreement with Inamps [National Institute for Social Security 
Medical Assistance] was attended to through opening an 
extraordinary 232 billion cruzeiro line of credit, in accordance 
with Provisional Measure No. 447 that was signed on 12 March by 
Deputy Inocencio de Oliveira, when he was acting president. 
  The authors of the Joint Committee's note obtained on 17 
March the signatures of the leaders of the main political 
parties, with the exception of the PSDB, for urgent voting on 
Provisional Measure No. 441. 
  Deputy Joao Paulo (PT-MG) [Workers Party-Minas Gerais State] 
believes that the government acts in an "illegal and 
disrespectful" way in order to "belittle" Congress. "The 
provisional measure has an article that allows for the 
readjustment of the first budget project up to a month before 
the resources are released. With this article in hand, a budget 
is not needed," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Carmen Kozak] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- The numerous internal and external 
difficulties that the constitutional revision has faced in 
Congress have led to a unanimous opinion: The revision is done 
for. "This Congress is not concerned about changing anything, 
and certainly not about carrying out a revision," fired general 
coordinator Deputy Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party -- Rio Grande do Sul]. The few legislators 
present during the meeting, including the assistant 
coordinators, agreed. Only PFL [Liberal Front Party] leader 
Luis Eduardo Magalhaes (BA) [Bahia] is continuing his attempts 
to inject the process with some vitality. He admits his 
limitations, and that he is alone: "We still have a chance if 
we bring forward the date for voting on the chapter on economic 
order." "This is not a revision; it is a comedy," says an 
important PFL leader. 
  The five months of impasse in the discussions and voting on 
just about everything have created new casualties in the 
pro-revision group. The PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] 
and the PMDB have said publicly that it is impossible to 
continue working with such great internal disagreement. The PL 
[Liberal Party], following the example of the PTB (Brazilian 
Labor Party], decided to join the group of obstructionist 
legislators, and announced that it would only vote on the 
chapter on economic order. Important PPR [Progressive Renewal 
Party] leaders prefer not to say openly that they no longer 
believe in the revision. "We have not thrown in the towel yet, 
as we want changes in the chapter on economic order, but we know 
it is not enough," regrets an experienced PPR legislator. 
  It took the leaders of parties promoting the revision two 
weeks to realize that the reform is definitively at risk. 
Yesterday they realized that the situation was practically 
irreversible. Out of 12 proposals only two were approved in the 
two required sessions, and only one in the first session. "We 
lost all the important votes. One example is the non-compulsory 
vote. Do you need any more proof that Congress does not want 
structural changes?" said assistant coordinator Gustavo Krause 
(PFL-PE) [PFL-Pernambuco]. "I do not care if I lose. What is 
important is to show who is who in this house," Jobim and 
Magalhaes said. 
  The issue that weighed most heavily in this failure to 
produce results was the difficulty in negotiating an amendment 
to facilitate the trial of legislators involved in common 
crimes. Last night legislators were unable to make any progress 
in the discussions on this issue, despite the fact that there 
are 450 congressmen in their third term. "Those who are not 
prepared to compromise and discuss internal matters cannot 
discuss more important matters," PSDB leader Deputy Arthur da 
Tavola (RJ) [Rio de Janeiro] said. 
  "I cannot see any light at the end of the tunnel. The 
revision is dead," regrets Deputy Jose Genoino (PT-SP) [Workers 
Party -- Sao Paulo] who supported all coordinator's proposals. 
"Those against the revision will pay a very high price for not 
allowing the approval of structural reforms that are essential 
for the country," said a PT follower who supported PT 
participation in the revision process. 
  "We threw jobs and health care improvement through the 
window," complains one of the most dedicated legislators. "I 
cannot take the initiative, but why can't Congress have the 
courage to publicly admit that the conditions are no longer 
appropriate for continuing the revision process?" Jobim asked 
Magalhaes.

<F P=106> [Article by Celson Franco: "Military Most Active Lobbyists </F>
in Revision Process"] 
  [Text] Brasilia--The Armed Forces have put together the 
best organized and most active lobby for the constitutional 
revision process. Officers have traded their uniforms for 
business suits and are scouring the corridors and offices of 
Congress in small groups in an attempt to convince all 
congressmen, regardless of ideological coloring, of the 
correctness of their proposals. Their chief proposal, embodied 
in a constitutional amendment submitted by Deputy Adylson Motta 
(PPR [Progressive Renewal Party], Rio Grande do Sul), removes 
them from the category of public servants and promotes them to 
that of "servants of the state." The immediate objective of that 
proposal is to solve the problem of pay. 
  "One purpose, obviously, is to give the military a merited 
raise," says Motta. "The Constitution was written in a 
revanchist era, and the military were punished as a result." 
  Actually, the military wanted to be recognized as "servants 
of the fatherland." In the explanatory statement accompanying 
his amendment, Motta listed characteristics supposedly 
distinguishing the military from other public employees: "strong 
professional ethics imposing irreproachable moral conduct" and 
"unconditional compliance with the obligation to do one's duty 
and sacrifice one's own life in defense of the fatherland." But 
the expression "servants of the fatherland" was changed to 
"servants of the state." Some congressmen, especially in the PT 
[Workers Party], considered "fatherland" to be an exaggeration 
and demanded its withdrawal as a condition for negotiating the 
amendment. 
  Equality before the law--The basic proposal is found in 
Subparagraph 12: "Compensation for the military on the active 
roster, in the reserve, or in retirement is regulated by a 
separate law." Motta's amendment is supplemented by another 
bill, this one submitted by Deputy Prisco Viana (PPR, Bahia) and 
stipulating, in Paragraph X, that "the general revision of pay 
for civilian and military public servants will take place on the 
same day, except in the case of legal pay adjustments initiated 
by the president of the republic and intended to implement the 
equality before the law that is dealt with in Article 39 of the 
Constitution." 
  The target of military lobbyists is the Emergency Social 
Fund, which is vital to the administration's economic plan. 
Article 74 of the amendment establishing that fund prohibits the 
granting of differentiated pay increases to the military, and 
according to the military, that makes it impossible to achieve 
the pay equality before the law that the Constitution calls for. 
"Establishing the same standards for civilians and military is 
illogical," says Deputy Francisco Rodrigues (PTB [Brazilian 
Labor Party], Rondonia). He reports that over the past few days, 
congressional advisers to the military ministries have been 
stepping up their contacts with deputies and senators in an 
attempt to persuade them to eliminate Article 74 from the fund 
bill. 
  Military lobbyists are not confining themselves to the pay 
issue. For example, they do not approve of the establishment of 
a Ministry of Defense. And they do not want to lose their status 
as guarantors of law and order, which Deputy Jose Genoino (PT, 
Sao Paulo), wants to take away. Supporters of a redefinition of 
the constitutional role of the Armed Forces argue that calling 
them guardians of order is what gave the military the pretext 
for the coups recorded in our history. 
  Fearing internationalization of the Amazon Region, the 
military are also preparing amendments affecting the Indian 
reservations. They recognize the Indians' rights over the areas 
they occupy, but make an exception in the case of border lands. 
"The native peoples have no notion of what a geographic border 
dictated by nationality or state boundaries is," claims Senator 
Irapuan Costa, Jr. (PP [Progressive Party], Goias). 
  IPVA--The military even want to amend the article allowing 
the authorities to protect assets with historical or cultural 
value and thus "eliminate the power of one authority over the 
property of another." In this case, the object is to protect 
military property, which is the target of what they call an 
"abuse of authority," especially on the part of mayors. Another 
amendment is concerned with collection of the IPVA [tax on 
ownership of automotive vehicles]. Some municipalities, basing 
their action on Article 155 of the Constitution, have decided to 
apply the IPVA to aircraft, ships, and tanks. 
<H5>  No More Right To Intervene </H5>
  The military do not want to lose the role of guardians of 
law 
and order that is assigned to them by Article 142 of the 
Constitution--that being perhaps the article most targeted by 
left-wing congressmen, especially those in the PT. Deputy Jose 
Genoino (PT, Sao Paulo), for example, says that the Armed Forces 
ought to restrict themselves to national defense and the 
guaranteeing of constitutional powers. Fear exists in the Left 
that in keeping with the tradition of coups that extends from 
the proclamation of the republic until 1964, the military will 
again invoke their role as defenders of law and order to 
legitimize their interventions. 
  Genoino, who was a guerrilla fighter for the PCdoB 
[Communist 
Party of Brazil] in the 1970's and now debates with his former 
enemies in Congress, knows how important the amendment placing 
the military in the special category of "servants of the state" 
is to the Armed Forces. And he wants to trade his support on 
that point for withdrawal of the provision giving the military 
responsibility for guaranteeing law and order. "They are going 
to have to negotiate," Genoino says. 
  Maybe so, but not now. According the military lobby's plan, 
the first step was to prepare the amendments in which it was 
interested. The next step was to select congressmen to sponsor 
the proposals. The military are currently in the persuasion 
phase: they are discussing their proposals with representatives 
of all the parties. There are over 30 amendments affecting the 
military, but not all of them have military support. Examples 
are the amendment abolishing compulsory military service and the 
one establishing the Ministry of Defense.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The Brazilian Government is developing a 
cellular phone project, using Brazilian satellites, which as of 
1998 will enable telephone contact between anywhere in Brazil 
and some Central American countries. This information was 
announced yesterday by Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications 
Inc.] President Adyr da Silva during a briefing before the 
National Defense Committee of the Chamber of Deputies. 
  This Brazilian project seeks to resist an onslaught by 
foreign companies, especially that by Motorola, which is casting 
its net wide in search of partners for its $4-billion 
megaproject called Iridium, which seeks to surround the earth 
with a network of telephone communications satellites. Brazil 
was not impressed with Iridium because of its high cost and the 
impossibility of having a say in its development. Therefore, it 
sought its own alternative. 
  This project, which has been called Eco-8, will only cost 
$265 million and will consist of an uplink to eight satellites 
orbiting the equator at a height of 2,000 km. It will enable 
telephone communications from any point of the country. 
Explaining that this technology will permit communications even 
in non-cost-effective regions, Da Silva noted: "This is no 
dream; it is our objective." 
  Beside telephone communications, the satellite network will 
make possible communications by fax, location by radio, 
telemetry, border control, and rural telephony, among other 
things. The technology to develop this project is almost 
entirely available on the Brazilian market and the domestic 
industry has the know-how to manufacture the equipment. Even 
the launching of the satellites can be achieved with a domestic 
rocket from the Alcantara Base in Maranhao State. 
  The only problem is the range of the Brazilian rocket, since 
it is still unable to reach a height of 2,000 km. Da Silva said 
that if this is not possible by then, the satellites can be put 
into a lower orbit, although this will leave 25 percent of the 
territory without coverage. The domestic satellites 
manufactured by the National Institute of Space Research (INPE) 
will be used to test some of the systems of the Eco-8 project.

  [Editorial Report] Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in 
Portuguese on 18 March publishes on page 4 a 700-word 
unattributed article on the results of a survey showing current 
voting preferences for the different presidential candidates. 
  The article notes that the Brazilian Public Opinion and 
Statistics Institute, Ibope, interviewed 2,000 voters throughout 
the country between 18 and 22 February. According to the 
results of this poll, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva leads the pack 
with 29 percent of the votes; Paulo Maluf and Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso come in tied for second with 11 percent of the votes 
each; Leonel Brizola and Antonio Carlos Magalhaes are third with 
8 percent each; and Orestes Quercia and Alvaro Dias come in 
fourth with 4 percent of the votes. 
  The article also notes that Lula "has well-distributed 
support, in cities and rural areas, in the north and south, and 
among rich and poor." 
  The article also points out that Lula has a high rejection 
rate, while Cardoso has the lowest rejection rate among all 
presidential candidates, "which will become very important in 
the runoff election."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Marcelo Pontes: "Lula's Attempt To Isolate PT </F>
Radicals"] 
  [Text] Luis Inacio Lula da Silva has a very peculiar 
formula for escaping the moorings of the orthodox PT [Workers 
Party] bureaucracy and its radical ideas. "I feel that we must 
come up with a government program that is not `principlist,'" 
says Lula. 
  The dictionary does not record the jargon used in PT 
assemblies, but Lula provides the translation: "It is right for 
a party to defend its principles, but in economics, the right 
program is the one that is feasible." 
  A better translation is that Lula will defend the PT's right 
to keep its dogmas but that when the time comes to formulate a 
government program, the party will not be able to prevent him 
from adapting those principles to the realities of the country 
and those facing someone who needs to expand his range of 
alliances in connection with the election of a president of the 
republic. 
  In other words, it does the PT no good to put its ideal--its 
dream of a revolutionary rupture--down on paper because if it 
does come to power, it will do so not by force but by the free 
will of the voters. The party must come down to the real world 
and propose a government program that can actually be carried 
out with the broadest possible support from society. 
  The foreign debt is a good example. The PT's outline of a 
government program claims that when Lula becomes president, he 
will decree a moratorium. The majority of the party's leaders 
may even be conscientiously convinced that that is the best way 
to deal with all foreign debt owed by Third-World countries. But 
they will be demonstrating political blindness if they try to 
impose that formula in the conditions now prevailing in Brazil, 
which is making an effort to come to terms with the 
international financial community. 
  Lula even says that "the foreign debt cannot be looked at 
today the way it was in 1980, when there was an oil crisis and 
interest rates rose from 6 to 21 percent." And he adds a basic 
economic fact for consideration by the PT's orthodox members: 
"There is a commercial debt, and Brazil must pay it." 
  The treatment Lula is imagining for the foreign debt is 
political and, therefore, much broader than a simple choice 
between the two solutions of pay or no pay. He recognizes that 
every $1 billion leaving the country and going to creditors is 
money taken away from the fight against poverty. But instead of 
refusing to pay, he is thinking about uniting Brazil and the 
debtor countries in a bloc that will negotiate with the creditor 
countries. "You are going to argue using the political strength 
you have," Lula says. 
  He feels that if they unite, the Third-World countries will 
be strong enough to persuade their creditors to reduce their 
debts. "Didn't they reduce Poland's debt by 50 percent? Why 
don't they do the same for the other countries?" 
<H5>  Magnifying Glass </H5>
  Lula likes to say that the PT's internal disagreements are 
viewed with a magnifying glass. "The problems are smaller than 
they are depicted as being," he says. 
  According to him, the uproar over the government program 
arose because a draft program had been made public even before 
it was reviewed by the party's Executive Committee. The 
Executive Committee is scheduled to meet on the 17th to approve 
the program. 
  The program will then be distributed for broad debate until 
the PT holds its national meeting on 30 April and 1 May, when 
Lula's candidacy will be made official. At the same time, Lula 
wants to open the program up for debate with the other parties. 
  Concerning the disagreements with the PT's federal bloc in 
Congress, Lula says that the Executive Committee has not been as 
hard on the bloc as has been reported. He points out that the 
Executive Committee authorized the bloc to vote for the 
Emergency Social Fund which Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
needed so badly. 
  "The problem is that in constitutional revision, people are 
just going through the motions. There are important things that 
the bloc should be participating in, but the conservatives have 
set a steamroller going to approve everything they want. There 
is no way that the bloc is going to support that and pretend 
that it is democracy," Lula says. 
<H5>  Stalled </H5>
  On the day when the Executive Committee meets to approve the 
PT's government program, Lula will start another of his 
caravans. He will tour Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and 
Parana through 4 March. 
  Like everyone, he feels that the presidential race is sort 
of 
confused. "The fact that Quercia is a candidate again proves 
that the Right has not yet found someone. If it cannot find 
someone, it will do what it did with Collor: choose one to be 
anti-Lula," says Lula. 
  The PT candidate does not believe that Antonio Britto will 
be 
the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] candidate. 
"Getting elected requires a little professionalism. The big 
professional in the PMDB is Quercia, who controls the party 
machinery and a lot of money," he says. 
  Lula practically rules out the possibility of an arrangement 
with the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]: "They are 
expecting Fernando Henrique's star to rise. His economic plan 
may actually work out two or three months from now, but it will 
not make up for the losses it is causing." 
  To those who belittle his chance of winning the presidential 
election on the grounds that he has stalled in the public 
opinion polls, Lula responds with a smile: "Comical. I am at 30 
percent. It is more likely that I will reach 50 percent than 
that the runner-up will reach 30 percent. They only say that 
Lula has stalled at 30 percent. No one is saying that Brizola 
has stalled at 7 percent, Maluf at 12 percent, and Sarney at 10 
percent."

<F P=106> [Article by Dora Kramer: "Britto Repeating Collor's Growth"] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia--A comparison of the paths followed by 
Fernando Collor and Antonio Britto--in terms of their 
performance in pre-election polls--emerged last week as a strong 
argument by those who feel that the former minister of social 
security will be the candidate capable of charming Brazilians 
over 16 years of age on 3 October. The man in charge of the 
polls that guided Collor after the end of 1988, political 
scientist Marco Antonio Coimbra of the Vox Populi Institute, 
supports that argument to some degree and believes that the 
major similarity between the two is "the personification of 
something new." 
  The argument that Britto is now repeating the rising curve 
shown by the Collor "phenomenon" at the start of 1989 and that 
this could indicate to political parties interested in a 
candidate in the center that the path "lies that way" is 
supported by Deputies Miro Teixeira and Gustavo Krause--both 
above suspicion in theory. They do not belong to the PMDB 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], nor do they belong to the 
same trend of political opinion. 
  Even so, on different days during this week of tension 
between the executive and legislative branches precisely on the 
issue of the presidential race, the two men circulated through 
various congressional circles with the same message. "This is a 
unique opportunity that Britto cannot let slip," said Krause. 
"No doubt about it, the phenomenon is the same; the percentage 
curves are very similar," Miro agreed. 
  Far from Brasilia in Belo Horizonte, a calm Coimbra has been 
working intensely since the middle of last year on polls 
concerned with this race. He is coming up with technical 
analyses which, if they do not support the view held by the 
congressmen, at least do not overthrow it completely. In 
Coimbra's opinion, the close similarity between Britto and 
Collor lies in their identification with the idea of renewal. 
"Despite the frustration with Collor, who also represented 
renewal, the voters still prefer someone who strikes them as 
being less tainted by old political vices," he said, and he then 
presented the figures that are beginning to be used to point up 
not the similarities but the differences. At the start of 1989, 
the polls showed that 50 percent of the voters would choose the 
candidate whose image indicated a lack of ties with the old 
power structures--in other words, someone new. 
  Now--"perhaps a little because of fear of the disappointment 
caused by Collor"--there has been a change unfavorable to 
Britto. The winning profile is no longer that of the squeaky 
clean. First of all, the voters are saying that they prefer a 
candidate "with labor--union--ties." Score one for Lula. Second, 
however, there is still a desire for something new. And that is 
where Britto's rise in popularity comes in, although with a 
difference compared to Collor. The poll respondents feel that 
unlike Collor, who had been a deputy, mayor, and governor, the 
former minister lacks any other experience in government. 
Coimbra interprets this to mean that they like Britto very much. 
But that they think he should run at some future time. 
  But one fact is causing the pendulum to swing back in 
Britto's favor. Out of 50 politicians whose names were presented 
to respondents with the request that they assign them a score of 
from 1 to 10, Britto scored highest. He received a 7, and with 
the exception of Jaime Lerner, who got a 5, all the others 
scored a rousing 1, 2, or 3. 
  Getting back the comparison between Britto and Collor, 
Coimbra recalls that at the start of 1989, Collor's standing 
with the voters was more or less what Britto's is now. It 
hovered around 6 or 7 percent, whereas the former minister now 
stands at around 8 percent. But Collor was known to only 12 
percent of the voters, whereas Britto is known to 50 percent. 
Since the other candidates--Lula, Maluf, Brizola, and Quercia, 
for example--are known to 95 percent of the voters, Coimbra's 
conclusion is that like Collor, "Britto has room to grow." Less 
room than Collor had, but much more than any of the other 
current candidates. 
  As far as differences are concerned, Coimbra introduces 
another element, this one unfavorable to Britto. "Collor entered 
the race with the image of leader, savior of the fatherland, and 
fighter in all areas. Not Britto. The voters know that he solved 
an extremely important problem in the Ministry of Social 
Welfare, but only one. This means that he still has the image of 
a specialist, and that is not good in a paternalistic country, 
where the voters want the candidate to solve not one but all the 
problems in their lives." 
  But Coimbra draws attention to one basic fact. "Over 50 
percent of the voters do not know anything about this election. 
They have no idea of the date on which it will be held or even 
that it will cover three levels of government." This, he says, 
indicates two things. The first is that in Brazil, every 
election is a surprise from the standpoint of rules. The second 
is that the game is still very much in its beginning stages and 
that the voters are very apprehensive, distrustful, and 
uncertain as to who they will vote for.

  [Text] The Cuban Government and Rio de Janeiro State 
University (UERJ) have signed an agreement to develop joint 
technological projects in the areas of bioceramics, industrial 
automation, oil technology, and informatics. The result of the 
programs will then be commercialized and the profits divided 
among the participants. 
  The initiative to sign the agreement came from the 
Brazilians. The negotiations began last February with the visit 
of UERJ Rector Hesio Cordeiro and Paulo Jorge Paes Leme, 
director of the Polytechnic Institute, to Havana. 
  Cuban Minister of Higher Education Fernando Vecino Alegret 
was in Rio de Janeiro yesterday to coordinate with Hesio 
Cordeiro the details for signing the agreement. Cordeiro will 
return to Cuba on 20 March to sign the final terms of the 
agreement.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 17 
March. 
  Despite high inflation rates and the uncertainty created by 
the government, the Brazilian economy is making progress. Last 
year the GDP rose 4.5 percent, and the industrial sector grew 
15.5 percent with the creation of 497,204 new companies compared 
with 1992. Of this total, 28,801 were created in Rio de Janeiro, 
7,000 more than in the previous year. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO 
BRASIL in Portuguese 20 Feb 94 p 26) 
  The Inter-American Development Bank granted a $350 million 
loan that will be used in a project designed to clean up 
Guanabara Bay. This project will improve the quality of life of 
7.3 million people living in the area. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO 
BRASIL in Portuguese 10 Mar 94 p 15) 
  With 223 votes for, 42 against, and five abstentions, the 
Chamber of Deputies on 9 March approved a draft bill authorizing 
the government to pay a debt of the defunct Sugar and Alcohol 
Institute, IAA, to U.S. and British creditors. This debt is the 
result of a sugar sale contract that IAA failed to comply with 
under former President Jose Sarney's administration. (Rio de 
Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 10 Mar 94 Economic 
Section p 10) 
  Planning Minister Beni Veras, Education Minister Murilio 
Hingel, and acting Finance Minister Clovis Carvalho on 18 March 
signed a $160 million agreement with the World Bank. The funds 
will be used to implement anti-AIDS programs. (Rio de Janeiro 
JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 19 Mar 94 p 16)

  [Text] New Delhi, 18 Mar (PL) -- During a visit to this 
city, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina today delivered to 
Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao a message from 
President Fidel Castro. 
  During the meeting, the prime minister showed interest in 
Cuba's current situation and said relations between the two 
peoples will always be special, despite the difficulties the two 
countries are facing. Rao said he will support any bilateral 
initiatives to reinforce ties, and he thanked Robaina for Cuba's 
donation to the Mahastra earthquake victims in September. 
  Robaina said he felt compelled to visit India during his 
tour 
of the continent, because India is a country that has maintained 
historic friendly ties with Cuba. 
  In terms of international affairs, the two leaders agreed on 
the need to keep working to reinforce the Nonaligned Movement 
and to attain greater cooperation among developing countries. 
  At the end of the meeting, the Cuban foreign minister held a 
news conference at which he said his country opposes any form of 
interference in India's internal affairs, and he expressed 
support for India's position on the Kashmir issue. He also 
underlined India's role in the Nonaligned Movement and the fact 
that India's opinion and position are highly regarded among the 
member-states. 
  Robaina, who arrived in New Delhi on Thursday, has met with 
India's top leaders on numerous occasions. 
  Robaina's talks with Rao were preceded by an official 
meeting 
between the Indian and Cuban delegations studying economic, 
scientific, and technical cooperation between the two countries. 
  The host delegation was headed by Salman Khursheed, minister 
of state for external affairs, and included the ministers of 
health, agriculture, commerce, fisheries, food, and science and 
technology. 
  The two sides agreed on the need to increase bilateral trade 
because both countries intend to make large investments in 
various areas of their respective economies. 
  Trade between Havana and New Delhi fell 50 percent following 
the collapse of the socialist bloc with which both nations 
traded actively. 
  Currently, India is conducting a children's immunization 
program for which the nation needs anti-meningococcal vaccines 
produced in Cuba. 
  India also showed interest in agriculture, specifically 
Cuba's experiences in tobacco and apiculture. 
  During the talks, the two sides agreed to conduct exchanges 
and transfer technology on the manufacture of reinforced ships 
[barcos de ferrocemento] and other specific areas. 
  Minister Khursheed said a business delegation will soon be 
created to explore in Havana the possibility of future 
cooperation in a number of areas. Robaina said these talks are 
designed to determine what Cuba would need or might offer in 
terms of possible future investments. 
  During his 48-hour stay in New Delhi, Robaina talked with 
groups in solidarity with Cuba, as well as leaders of several 
political parties. He also met with more than 60 businessmen at 
the Chamber of Commerce and Industries of India. 
  Robaina leaves for Malaysia on an official visit tomorrow. 
He will later travel to Vietnam, the last stage of his tour 
through Asia.

  [Text] Hanoi, 21 Mar (PL) -- Vietnamese Foreign Affairs 
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam today stressed that Cuban Roberto 
Robaina's visit is a new development in the consolidation of 
bilateral ties. 
  Minutes before the Cuban foreign relations minister arrived 
at the Protocol House of the Vietnamese Government, Cam told 
PRENSA LATINA that the traditional ties of friendship and 
cooperation between the Caribbean island and the Indochinese 
nation received a major boost in the past 18 months. 
  The usually phlegmatic chief of Vietnamese diplomacy 
displayed a big smile and gave Robaina a strong embrace upon his 
arrival at Noi Bai Airport from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
  We know that your Asian tour has been exhausting, but we are 
happy to have you here and are convinced that your stay in 
Vietnam will further strengthen our bilateral ties in all areas, 
Cam told Robaina. 
  Meanwhile, Robaina emphasized that visiting Vietnam was not 
only an inescapable duty but an enormous pleasure, because it 
involves an undying friendship and a mutual desire to further 
advance collaboration and exchange in the economic, commercial, 
and scientific-technical areas, as well as in all possible areas. 
  He pointed out that as a reflection of its indestructible 
ties with the Asian nation, Cuba has in recent times felt the 
love and solidarity from it through specific and very 
significant actions. 
  Afterward, Robaina, accompanied by adviser Carlos Amores and 
Cuban Ambassador to Vietnam Tania Maceira, started official 
talks with his counterpart, Nguyen Manh Cam. 
  The visitor will also be greeted by Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet, who visited Havana last July and is among the main 
promoters of the expansion of ties between the two nations. 
  Tommorrow, the Cuban delegation will lay a wreath at the 
mausoleum of national hero Ho Chi Minh and will hold a number of 
meetings with Dau Ngoc Xuan, president of the State Committee 
for Cooperation and Investments, and with Nguyen Cong Tan and Le 
Van Triet, ministers of agriculture and food industry and of 
commerce, respectively. 
  Robaina, a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of 
Cuba, will meet with leaders of Vietnamese political and mass 
organizations, which have promoted campaigns of solidarity with 
the island in recent times to collect rice and school supplies. 
  The Cuban leader will also meet with Hong Ha, chief of the 
Foreign Affairs Commission and secretary of the Communist Party 
of Vietnam (CPV). On the same day Robaina will meet with CPV 
Secretary General Do Muoi. 
  The visiting foreign minister will grant a news conference 
before departing for Ho Chi Minh City on 23 March. In the 
southern capital city, the delegation will meet with Vo Tran 
Tri, CPV first secretary in that province, and Pham Chanh Truc, 
vice president of that city's Parliament. 
  In Ho Chi Minh City Robaina will end his Asian tour that 
started on 8 March and included Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, 
Myanmar, Cambodia, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam.

<F P=106> [Report by Rey Rodriguez -- all quotations marks as received] </F>
  [Text] Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, 23 Mar (PL) -- Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina said today that Cuba is immersed in a 
necessary process to change and that it requires the people's 
involvement so they feel they are participating in it. 
  In a meeting with Vo Tran Chin, member of the Politburo of 
the Vietnamese Communist Party (PCU) and its first secretary in 
this city, Robaina said that changes being implemented in his 
country are carried out under strong pressures, a permanent 
threat, and a pitiless blockade by the United States. 
  During the last stretch of his official tour covering eight 
countries of Asia and Southeast Asia, the Cuban foreign minister 
indicated that there are some risks that must be taken in every 
transformation process. "It would be much worse to engage in 
mistakes because we did not implement the needed changes," he 
added. 
  In commenting on the impact on Cuba of a possible lifting of 
the U.S. economic blockade, Robaina emphasized that such a step 
would entail a new type of challenge "which would not be 
strictly related to problems of food and welfare, but to issues 
related to morals, values, and principles." 
  The Cuban Communist Party [PCC] Politburo member stressed 
that Cuba is quite clear as to its final objective and will 
never back away from what it has accomplished so far. "In the 
economic sphere we are implementing many changes and there are 
still many more to be taken," he stated. 
  In addition, we want to receive firsthand input from a 
brother country such as Vietnam to which we are united not only 
through economic ties, but as result of a historical, timely, 
and open relationship," he added. 
  In expanding on the issue, Robaina commented that Cuba is 
about to start a process of recovery that depends on endeavor 
and work, without having to depend on one single commercial 
partner, by diversifying its economy as well as its foreign 
relations. 
  "Cuba is asking from the world what it professes for the 
world, understanding and respect," he declared. 
  The head of the Cuban diplomacy stressed that if there is 
something that gets his attention with respect to Vietnam's 
experiences, it is the manner in which the CPV controls and 
directs the renovation process. 
  On other hand, Vo Tran Chin commented that currently there 
are many aspects both countries can exchange in order to 
overcome the prevailing situation. 
  Before concluding his stay in this city, the Cuban 
delegation 
will meet tomorrow with leaders of the southern city and will 
tour sites of economic interest.

<F P=106> [Report by Fausto Triana] </F>
  [Text] Hanoi, 23 Mar (PL) -- Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina described his tour to eight Asian countries as 
successful and said Cuba will practice an offensive diplomacy in 
the future "because we are tired of being placed on the 
defendant's bench." 
  Robaina spoke to PRENSA LATINA after holding a news 
conference here today. He emphasized that his visit to Vietnam 
ends what was announced as a diplomatic offensive in several 
regions of the world to explain to several governments the truth 
about Cuba and to study economic experiences. 
  Our tours to the Caribbean and several Latin American 
countries in the past months and our tour to Asia now have given 
our interlocutors a broad vision of the process that is taking 
place in Cuba within a climate of respect and understanding, he 
explained. 
  Robaina indicated that in those contacts, Cuba was allowed 
to 
explain its current situation in its own words and was able to 
say things that are generally omitted by the big international 
media sources. 
  We are a country open to dialogue and willing to negotiate 
everything except our independence, sovereignty, and basic 
revolutionary achievements. We are willing to do so without any 
preconditions but based on the respect due to us for the place 
we have won in the world, he sentenced. 
  Cuba is not the hell it is said to be or the paradise it 
wants to be and, thus, does not have to be placed on the 
defendant's bench. From this moment on, we will coin the phrase 
offensive diplomacy as part of our legitimate aspiration to 
consolidate and expand our country's international relations, he 
added. 
  Robaina, who is probably the world's youngest foreign 
minister (38 years), said 1994 would be a year of very arduous 
work that would include a new tour to Latin America. The tour, 
which is to start in April, will include visits to Peru, 
Ecuador, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. 
  His project also includes a visit to the Middle East in the 
near future. However, before this, he will host an encounter 
called "The Nation and Emigration" to which members of the Cuban 
community abroad have been invited. 
  The meeting, scheduled to be held on 22, 23, and 24 April in 
Havana, will be attended by Cuban citizens who reside in the 
United States, Spain, Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina, the 
Caribbean, and other countries. 
  The Cuban foreign minister remarked the purpose of the 
meeting was to normalize ties between Cuba and its community 
abroad as all other nations do. "All the Cubans of goodwill who 
want to talk to their fatherland are invited. Only 
aggressiveness and hysteria have not been called," he added. 
  Going back to his tour of Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Burma, 
Cambodia, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam, which he started on 8 
March, Robaina emphasized the importance of exchanging ideas and 
of analyzing very valuable economic experiences in one of the 
world's most flourishing areas. 
  He highlighted that Vietnam had been one of the most 
important points in his tour due to the traditional bilateral 
ties of friendship and cooperation and reiterated that Cuba 
applauds and studies with particular attention, the economic 
process started by Hanoi eight years ago. 
  At his farewell, Robaina confessed to Deputy Foreign 
Minister 
Le Mai that he was impressed with the progress made by this 
Indo-Chinese country since he last visited it in 1990. He 
reiterated his government's gratitude to the Vietnamese 
Government and people for their concrete actions of solidarity 
with the Cubans. 
  Accompanied by Ambassador Tania Maceira and adviser Carlos 
Amores, among other officials, Robaina traveled to the southern 
Ho Chi Minh city where he will end his tour to Southern and 
Southeastern Asia tomorrow.

  [Text] Hanoi, 22 Mar (PL) -- Commerce Minister Le Van Triet 
confirmed today, that Vietnam will send 100,000 tons of rice to 
Cuba during 1994, as part of the cooperation and commercial 
exchange agreement signed between the two countries. 
  According to diplomatic sources, during a meeting with 
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, the Vietnamese minister 
expressed optimism for Cuba's economic renovation process and 
emphasized that his country understood the importance of 
complying with the commercial agreement agreed for the current 
year. 
  Robaina also met with Nguyen Cong Tan, the minister of 
agriculture and food industry. Both officials expressed their 
satisfaction with the increasing climate of cooperation between 
their countries to further mutually advantageous goals. 
  Cong Tan, who is also the president of the Joint 
Vietnam-Cuba 
Intergovernment Commission, said he endorsed the boosting of 
cooperation not only in agriculture, but also in the fields of 
construction, health, education, science, biotechnology, and 
marine transportation, among others. 
  On the second day of his official visit to Vietnam, the 
Cuban 
foreign minister attended a meeting with Nguyen Mai, the vice 
president of the State Cooperation and Investment Committee. 
  Mai agreed with Robaina on the need to consolidate programs 
to establish joint ventures between their countries in the 
construction and other areas prior to exploring other sectors. 
[sentence as received] 
  On the last leg of his tour to South and Southeastern Asia, 
the Cuban foreign minister was received by Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet yesterday and held official talks with his colleague Nguyen 
Manh Cam. 
  Robaina, who is to meet with Do Muoi, the secretary general 
of the Vietnamese Communist Party, will hold a news conference 
tomorrow to summarize his Asian tour which also included 
Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Burma, Cambodia, India, and Malaysia.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Fausto Triana: "Roberto Robaina, A </F>
Young and Impromptu Diplomat"] 
  [Text] At 38, Roberto Robaina is one of the youngest 
foreign ministers of the world. This is not a symbolic fact. 
Robaina, Cuba's foreign minister, is a frontrunner. He speaks in 
a fresh language and has a very personal style he calls 
"impromptu diplomacy." 
  Playing with words and exhibiting his permanent good sense 
of 
humor, Robaina says he is not a "career diplomat." He was 
appointed to the post approximately a year ago at a time of very 
serious economic difficulties in Cuba. 
  Since then he has tested his capabilities, "immediately 
aware 
of the importance of a duty by which we open the world's doors 
to become part of a new international political format, in 
particular, to tell our truth in our own voice." 
  I followed him through Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and 
Vietnam, 
and finally, in what was supposed to be a relaxing interview but 
what became a maze of ideas by an interlocutor impressively 
ready for a dialogue. 
  Discussing many matters at the end of his tour through eight 
Asian countries was the reward he gave me for my tenacious 
effort to secure an exclusive interview for PRENSA LATINA. 
  Cuba's economic crisis looked to me as the best option for 
the first question. 
  [Robaina] It is true the situation is still difficult and 
that it will take big efforts to find adequate solutions to our 
project, but I am pleased to say the worst is over. The crisis 
hit rock bottom and we are now in a launch phase. We see the 
light at the end of the tunnel. We are moving with greater 
security. 
  [Triana] In this new light, what economic options does the 
Cuban Government have? 
  [Robaina] A group of measures have been adopted and other 
measures are being discussed to revitalize the economy without 
renouncing the fundamental achievements of the Revolution. 
Openings to foreign investments have developed, our foreign 
relations have been diversified, and we continue developing, in 
spite of the huge pressure from the U.S. blockade, which also 
boycotts every effort Cuba makes to initiate negotiations and 
pressures those who want to invest in our island. 
  [Triana] Is there any change of attitude in the current U.S. 
Administration with regard to Cuba? 
  [Robaina] The United States is now using a less aggressive 
language, but we know that internal mechanisms will keep 
Washington from changing its attitude toward our country even if 
it has this intention. Therefore we do not see, for example, any 
surprise lifting of the embargo. We are prepared to negotiate, 
as we have often said, on the basis of respect for our 
independence and sovereignty, and the right our 35-year-old 
Revolution gave us to speak out. 
  [Triana] Ever since you became foreign minister, you have 
worked on a very intense diplomatic offensive throughout the 
world. What is the object of this policy? 
  [Robaina] To explain the truth of our plan, to listen to the 
economic experiences of many other countries that have had 
successful results in that field, and to explore all the 
cooperation possibilities. Latin America and the Caribbean are a 
priority. This is the setting from which we were removed and the 
setting we are recovering. We are talking now in terms of a 
diplomatic offensive because we are tired of sitting on the 
defendant's bench. 
  [Triana] What does your tour through Indonesia, Thailand, 
Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam mean? 
  [Robaina] In this region of the world, there have been 
significant economic transformations, and we are interested in 
analyzing and learning from them to apply in Cuba whatever may 
be applicable. We want to directly report on our openings to 
foreign investments and announce our aspirations to have 
mutually beneficial cooperation and exchanges in all possible 
fields. 
  [Triana] Any comment on your Asian tour? 
  [Robaina] It was successful because we found respect and 
understanding, unanimous condemnation of the U.S. blockade 
against Cuba, and the possibilities of economic cooperation. 
Vietnam deserves special mention. This is a dear country that 
after going through big sacrifices and challenges was able to 
build a road to development without renouncing its socialist 
principles. 
  We applaud what Vietnam is doing and its achievements 
encourage us tremendously. We also celebrate the end of the 
economic embargo to which it was unjustly subjected by the 
United States. We are closely following the Vietnamese process 
and once again thank this heroic people for their specific 
solidarity with Cuba and their decision to comply with this 
year's trade agreement. 
  [Triana] You return to Havana and almost immediately begin 
another tour through Latin America including Peru, Argentina, 
Uruguay, and Paraguay, after the 22-24 April meeting with 
representatives of the Cuban community abroad, and this is 
followed by a tour of Arabian countries. Is it your youth which 
allows you to tackle so many tasks in a row? 
  [Robaina] Fortunately, in Cuba we work with a group spirit. 
It is a great responsibility to be foreign minister right now, 
and success mostly depends on the officials who accompany me. We 
have a large group that is very well prepared, technically 
speaking, and personally speaking, since I am young I am 
compelled to try to represent the new generations as best I can. 
  [Triana] The international media said the call for "The 
Nation and the Immigrant Community" meeting in Cuba is an 
audacious step taken by the island's government. What is the 
purpose of that meeting? 
  [Robaina] We invited Cubans who live in the United States, 
Spain, Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina, the Caribbean, and other 
places and who are willing to participate in a dialogue with 
their homeland. We did not invite hysteria or aggressiveness, 
but some of those who were not invited to the meeting hastened 
to reject an invitation that was not extended. Our goal is to 
normalize relations with the Cuban community abroad, as is done 
by all countries in the world. 
  [Triana] People in Cuba and abroad talk about Robaina's 
youth. You greatly impressed your Cambodian counterpart, Prince 
Norodom Sirivuth, during your Far East tour. In Cambodia like in 
the rest of the countries he visited, the head of Havana's 
diplomacy made an unusual request for this kind of trip: a 
bicycle. The Cambodian prince was so enthusiastic that he went 
an early morning ride through Phnom Penh with the Cuban envoy. 
"In barely 24 hours, we got to know each other so well that I 
felt duty bound to visit Havana this year," Sirivuth commented. 
  [Robaina] The most important news in my country is not a 
young minister, but the essential role young Cubans have in the 
country's economic, political, and social development. In other 
words, the place they have earned. As far as I am concerned, my 
goal is to constantly hold consultations on a wider scale with 
the people I represent. 
  [Triana] What advise would you give your generation? 
  [Robaina] I do not believe I am in a position to give 
advise. 
I believe each generation has to face -- in its place and under 
its own conditions -- the role it has to play. Nevertheless, if 
you insist on asking that question, I would tell the young 
people: The most important thing is not to resign yourself to 
what has been done. New generations should not settle for what 
has been done and they should not talk only about history and 
what was done; they should make their own history, a 
contemporary history. 
  [Triana] How can you possibly take on so many tasks and 
still 
have time for the family? 
  [Robaina] It requires a personal effort to find time during 
the day so I can, for example, take time in the morning to get 
my son ready to go to school or to take him bicycle riding on 
the weekend, and talk with him. My family has its own 
responsibilities. A housewife's tasks are as difficult as a 
minister's tasks in Cuba.

<F P=106> [Report by Ilsa Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 21 Mar (PL) -- A Cuban Foreign Ministry 
official stated today that Cuba expects the Non-Aligned Movement 
[NAM] mid-summit [intercumbre], scheduled to be held in Cairo in 
May, will give continuity to the excellent work being done by 
Indonesia, which currently heads the movement. 
  The actions carried out by Indonesia in the NAM presidency, 
dashed the doubts on the movement's validity following the end 
of the East-West confrontation, Eumelio Caballero, chief of the 
Cuban Foreign Ministry Multilateral Affairs Directorate, told 
PRENSA LATINA. 
  The diplomat pointed out that there is an increasing 
awareness of the revitalization of the NAM and of the need for 
those countries -- which represent four-fifths of the people in 
the world -- to continue their efforts to attain space in the 
new world order. 
  He highlighted the active participation of the NAM countries 
in the United Nations and underscored that the movement 
participates in every UN group working to revitalize and 
democratize that important world organization. 
  After a period of inactivity during Yugoslavia's presidency 
(1989-1992), the interests of the NAM countries reappears at a 
time when a unipolar world is trying to ignore the rights of 
Third World countries, he added. 
  Although the East-West confrontation has disappeared, 
Caballero said, the movement has its own agenda which includes 
both the promotion of North-South economic talks and the 
reduction of political conflicts. 
  The ministers meeting in Cairo has on its agenda a [word 
indistinct] summit in Jakarta, held in September 1992, and will 
decide the city where the next NAM summit is to be held. 
  Nicaragua had requested to organize the 11th summit but, at 
the meeting in the Indonesian capital, pleaded economic and 
political problems and still has to confirm whether it maintains 
those plans. 
  Regarding the next NAM headquarters, Caballero said it was 
important to elect a president that is able to continue the 
active and efficient work done by Indonesia. 
  The Cuban diplomat also referred to the meeting of the 
so-called group of the president's friends, which was held in 
Jakarta last February. This initiative had positive results, 
because it allowed an important number of NAM member countries 
to exchange ideas on problems that will be broached at the 
ministers meeting in Cairo, he said.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 27 Mar (PL) -- Today, Colombian 
newspaper EL TIEMPO amended a report in which it linked the 
Cuban Government as well as a Colombian bishop to an alleged 
guerrilla summit. The newspaper also issued apologies to 
Havana, the prelate, and its readership. 
  After comparing and determining the credibility and 
authenticity of its source that prompted reports on an alleged 
trip to Cuba by Bishop Nel Beltran and a guerrilla summit being 
held on the island, EL TIEMPO decided to retract the report and 
apologize to the bishop and the Cuban Government. 
  The two-page apology published in Section 1 of the newspaper 
says, "it was the victim of an ill-intentioned machination, the 
intellectual origins and objectives of which have yet to be 
determined." 
  The newspaper was referring to evidence alleging that a 
Colombian guerrilla summit took place in Cuba in January in 
which Beltran participated. Reports on the alleged summit were 
published several days running, beginning on 10 March. 
  With respect to the summit, Prosecutor General Gustavo de 
Greiff also said he possessed "irrefutable evidence," which EL 
TIEMPO itself indicated "contributed to the disinformation." 
  The newspaper acknowledges the falsity of the reports, 
"despite the apparent accuracy of the information handed over by 
the initial source, confirmation by a reliable second source, 
and a state security agency's intelligence report that had been 
disclosed by a high-ranking government official." 
  EL TIEMPO also claims it relied on "an endorsement from the 
Prosecutor General's Office." 
  It adds: "By not contacting Bishop Nel Beltran, regardless 
of 
how difficult it may have been, Chief Editor Francisco Santos 
authorized the publication of the report without first 
subjecting it to essential screening to determine its accuracy." 
  The apology also indicates that "the aggressiveness in what 
is known in journalistic circles as `fast breaking news' 
prompted this newspaper, its chief editor, and, in particular, 
its Legal Editor Edgar Torres to make erroneous decisions that 
ultimately led to the publication of false reports and 
subsequent recurrent reports on the same issue, which today we 
proceed to rectify." 
  The Santa Fe de Bogota paper adds: "This, however, does not 
excuse the mistake, because by way of professional and sincere 
screening, as well as by meeting with those individuals 
mentioned in the report, we would have unmasked the source and 
avoided publishing misleading reports." 
  The Cuban Government, its embassy in Santa Fe de Bogota, and 
some of the highest-ranking Colombian authorities had repeatedly 
denied the disclosures. 
  Nevertheless, in light of certain evidence gathered by the 
Prosecutor General's Office, the Colombian Government decided to 
request an explanation from the Cuban Government. 
  Sources hostile to Cuba tried to take advantage of the 
election campaign in Colombia and even suggested breaking off 
diplomatic relations with Cuba, which were fully restored in 
October. 
  In explaining the incident, EL TIEMPO claims its source was 
a 
person who had been a former guerrilla member, an associate of 
Pablo Escobar (the slain chief of the Medellin drug cartel), and 
had served as an informant for state intelligence services. It 
adds that this source has now admitted he manipulated the 
newspaper, the Prosecutor General's Office, and the Colombian 
Government. 
  EL TIEMPO notes that as a result of the incident, the legal 
editor has presented his letter of resignation and the 
newspaper's Board of Directors is reviewing possible 
disciplinary measures. 
  Meanwhile, the chief editor also presented his resignation, 
and EL TIEMPO says that in due time it will disclose its 
decision on the matter. 
  In summarizing its correction, which it describes as 
significant and unusual, EL TIEMPO points out that "the big 
question now is who manipulated the former guerrilla, and who is 
the person or persons who masterminded this -- the real 
intellectual mastermind behind this manipulation of information?"

  [Text] Bogota, 20 Mar (PL) -- Today, the newspaper EL 
TIEMPO said the Colombian Government is "absolutely silent... 
about Fidel Castro's reply," while EL ESPECTADOR published a 
poll that favors maintaining relations with Cuba. On Friday, EL 
TIEMPO published a report quoting a denial by the head of 
military intelligence, statements by the Cuban ambassador, and 
Caracol's version of an alleged telephone call from the Cuban 
president to [Colombian] Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin. 
  EL TIEMPO has been publishing reports, without any evidence, 
of an alleged meeting in Havana of Colombian guerrilla leaders 
and Bishop Nel Beltran, which both the Cuban Government and the 
bishop have denied. 
  EL ESPECTADOR newspaper's front page headline read "Nel On 
Fantasy Island." An article, covered on an inside page, reports 
the Disney Reservation Center in Florida confirmed that 
Monsignor Beltran stayed there between 24-25 January. 
  This newspaper also publishes on its front page a poll taken 
by the National Consulting Center, which shows that most of the 
440 people asked favor maintaining diplomatic relations with 
Cuba even if it turns out that the guerrilla summit in Havana 
was held. Of the people polled, 51 percent replied that 
diplomatic ties should not be severed, 30 percent said yes they 
should, and 19 percent said they did not know.

<F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 18 Mar (PL) -- Cuban analysts today 
positively assessed the fact that the U.S. Congress has started 
debating proposals by legislators who are demanding the repeal 
of the Torricelli Law and who are calling for free trade with 
Cuba. 
  In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Rafael Hernandez, department 
head for the Center for American Studies, said the presentation 
and discussion of a draft bill by a group of congressmen headed 
by Representative Charles Rangel is important because this will 
enable Washington to measure the political cost of its policy 
toward Cuba. 
  Hernandez added that whether or not the repeal is approved, 
this discussion shows there is political interest in ending the 
blockade against Cuba both within and outside the U.S. Congress . 
  Hernandez explained that even within the U.S. Administration 
itself there are groups that have different ideas on the 
subject, and he stressed that because a group within Congress 
has adopted this position, greater support could be given to 
those arguing in favor of normalizing relations with Havana. 
  All this makes the U.S. national outlook more complex and 
varied, especially on the official governmental level, he said. 
  Writer and journalist Nicanor Leon Cotayo argued that what 
is 
taking place in Congress is symbolic of the growing U.S. 
awareness of the need to review the blockade policy. 
  He recalled that Rangel's proposal is not the only one, 
noting that others have tried to introduce modifications on bans 
preventing U.S. citizens from traveling to Cuba and that there 
have been calls for making current limits on medicinal exports 
more flexible. 
  Leon Cotayo said one cannot disregard an increasingly 
growing 
sentiment among important sectors of U.S. society regarding this 
issue. 
  Leon Cotayo also mentioned the importance of the debate as a 
message to the White House -- a message that indicates the 
blockade strategy is increasingly being questioned in the United 
States. 
  The Cuban writer described the congressional discussions 
that 
began the previous day as being significant in terms of the 
process of growing opposition to the blockade, which is felt in 
the heart of U.S. society. 
  This makes one think, he concluded, that even if the lifting 
of the embargo is not around the corner, we see on the other 
hand that it is not so far away. 
  Evelio Barrios, vice director for the Center for American 
Studies, said it is impossible for the U.S. Government to 
continue to ignore the political cost the blockade has on its 
international image. 
  He said: What is most important is that this will permit the 
assessment of a new consensus being created within Congress on 
the issue, even though I do not expect any changes in the 
official position in the immediate future. 
  Barrios also recalled that two UN votes favorable to Cuba 
opposed Washington's punitive measures, that editorials in 
influential U.S. newspapers have been critical of the blockade, 
and that several prominent people have denounced the blockade. 
  Moreover, the United States sees the serious international 
problems it has caused itself by implementing the Torricelli Law 
and by trying to destroy Cuba's economy.

  [Text] Havana, 21 Mar (PL) -- The weekly TRABAJADORES today 
reported that rejection of the U.S. economic blockade on Cuba is 
increasing in the United States, but at the same time, it is 
meeting resistance from unknown major forces in official and 
unofficial circles. 
  The mouthpiece of the Cuban Workers Federation (CTC) carried 
an article signed by writer and journalist Nicanor Lomplcotayt, 
an expert on U.S. issues, stating that the end of the siege of 
the island is neither in sight nor as distant as the most 
pessimists predicted. 
  Since Washington lifted the blockade against Vietnam, a 
country in which it lost over 60,000 soldiers during the imposed 
war in the 1960's, many ask if now the White House will end the 
blockade it has implemented against Cuba for over 30 years, the 
article comments. 
  It added that, when resuming the increasingly longer list of 
those who oppose the blockade, the Miami newspaper EL NUEVO 
HERALD said in its 7 March edition: 
  "From religious and humanitarian organizations to 
conservative editorialists, and from civil rights groups to 
business managers, the different critics of the trade embargo 
assert it is a Cold War relic which affects U.S. businesses or 
contributes to the island's poverty." 
  The situation is compounded by the start of the House of 
Representatives debates on the issue. Regardless of the 
results, it proves the extent of the internal criticism that 
this behavior has earned. In addition to other signs of 
international rejection, the UN Assembly General has issued two 
resolutions expressing its disapproval, TRABAJADORES emphasized. 
  If the decision to lift the embargo against Vietnam proves 
the U.S. businessmen's realism managed to displace the dogmatism 
and mental anachronism of a group of officials and congressmen, 
in Cuba's case I believe they could very well play a crucial 
role, Leon Cotayo said.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Nicanor Leon Cotayo: "Is the Embargo </F>
Against Cuba About To End?"] 
  [Text] Havana -- Now that Washington has lifted the embargo 
on Vietnam, where the United States lost nearly 60,000 men 
during the war imposed on that Asian nation, many people have 
wondered whether the White House will terminate the more than 
30-year-old U.S. blockade against Cuba. 
  I believe the end of the embargo is neither in sight nor in 
the future, as the most pessimistic might think. 
  The rejection of this ineffective and hostile posture toward 
Cuba has increased considerably. Concurrently, this U.S. 
position meets the determined resistance of important forces 
both in and outside government circles. 
  Summing up the opinions of the increasingly large number of 
those who oppose the embargo, the Miami newspaper the NEW HERALD 
reported on 7 March: "From religious and humanitarian 
organizations to conservative editors and from civil rights 
groups to business managers the various groups that criticize 
the commercial embargo say it is a Cold War relic that harms 
U.S. business or contributes to poverty on the island." 
  To this must be added the beginning of the embargo debates 
in 
the House of Representatives. Apart from the final results, the 
internal pressure has reached a point where, in addition to many 
expressions of international repudiation, two UN resolutions 
have been issued on the issue. 
  To all this could be added the powerful movement the 
organization Pastors for Peace coordinates in the United States 
against the embargo. An increasing number of U.S. church people 
are participating in this crusade, which picks up followers in 
other countries and Europe as well. 
  The fact the most influential U.S. newspapers, including THE 
WALL STREET JOURNAL, have criticized the embargo as the best way 
to deal with Cuba is another very meaningful indication of the 
trend which will prevail gradually and "step by step" [previous 
three words in English] in the United States. 
  If, with the lifting of the blockade against Vietnam, the 
realism and levelheadedness of U.S. businessmen has managed to 
do away with the dogmatism and anachronism of a group of 
officials and legislators, I believe, concerning Cuba's, they 
would not be too far away from playing a significant role. 
  That is, of course, if they are not forced to arrive too 
late 
to an event where businessmen from the American and European 
continents, among other areas, are already operating legally in 
places open to them. 
  All which has been said up to here must still confront tough 
opponents, which include, among other elements, electoral 
interests which, in their attempt to win the 1996 elections in 
Florida, have tied the Cuban policy to the dictates of the 
extreme rightist sectors in Miami; a Congress that faces 
elections in November and is extremely cautious of its actions; 
and even an overloaded official agenda which has not made the 
Cuban issue a priority. 
  To this we have to add, as an ingredient we cannot possibly 
ignore, the complicated situation triggered by the so-called 
White Water scandal in the current Democratic administration. 
  In my opinion, boosted by the most rightist sector of the 
U.S. political and business scenario with which President 
William Clinton has had disagreements since last year, this 
process will tend to favor, at least for the time being, those 
in Washington who advocate a conservative government position.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Jesus Bermudez Cutino, division </F>
general and military chief of the Intelligence Directorate of 
the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba, 
entitled; "Where Once There Was Fire, Only Ashes Remain"] 
  [Text] Havana [no date as received] -- This wise and 
sometimes amusing saying undoubtedly includes the complex and no 
less interesting world of international relations. If anyone 
has any doubts about that, he just needs to look at current 
relations between the United States and the Russian Federation. 
  Everything seems to indicate that the western pretext of the 
so-called "Soviet danger" is tending to change its name to the 
"Russian danger." Must there always be some sort of threat? 
  Defense Secretary William Perry said on 14 March that there 
could develop in Russia an "authoritarian, militarist, and 
imperialist nation hostile toward the West." In such a 
situation, "we might see the birth of a new version of the Cold 
War." Perry added that his country should therefore have a 
"strategy for protection." 
  According to the 6 February edition of THE WASHINGTON POST, 
British Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said before the 
conference on security policy in Munich, Germany that "the most 
probable threat to European security" is the potential danger 
that Russia might try to recover control over the territories of 
the "former Soviet empire." Has anyone ever said that is one of 
Russia's intentions? 
  Rifkind said such signals come not only from nationalist 
leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy but also from Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and other "moderate" officials. Are 
they real signals or are they unfounded fears leading to a 
search for pretexts for doing what they do in practice? 
  Following the Clinton-Boris Yeltsin summit in Moscow last 
January, both sides agreed on the need to move on to new stages 
of cooperation, including a U.S. promise to grant the Russian 
Government relatively modest assistance of $2.5 billion. 
  New obstacles to relations emerged suddenly. One of them was 
the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, with the ultimatum announced 
by NATO, led by the United States, to initiate air attacks on 
Serb positions if they did not withdraw their artillery. The 
carrot comes before the stick; it was always that way. 
  Later a Russian initiative gave an important boost to a 
solution to the controversy, at least temporarily, to avoid 
further air attacks. Russia achieved a victory with this 
measure. 
  Then something emerged by chance as if pulled out of a 
magician's sleeve: the famous case of alleged spy Aldrich Ames, 
a CIA official accused of working for special Soviet services 
since 1985 and later for similar Russian agencies. Was it 
discovered now or was it saved for the proper moment? Tempers 
flared. 
  It seems unreal that the friendship reached after so much 
"sacrifice" in the Cold War years (some people are already 
speaking of a "Cold Peace") [words indistinct]. It is not known 
how many they may have stored away in the drawer for a proper 
moment. A Russian general said he was surprised by the U.S. 
reaction, arguing that the CIA does worse things in Moscow. 
  But let's not fool ourselves. These are not fortuitous 
incidents. It is just that the huge propaganda machinery is 
cranked up when the system needs it. (That is how freedom of 
the press works in that country). 
  At least that is how the directors of the Russian agency 
ITAR-TASS think. A recent dispatch stated: "...attempts to 
give a political character (to the case) have shown once again 
that the intelligence service is a policy tool that can be 
efficiently used at the appropriate moment." 
  Perhaps at another time the Ames case would not have had 
such 
an effect. It seems it was necessary now, especially when one 
keeps in mind that the current administration has been accused 
by quite a few "hawks" of being [words indistinct]. 
  That is not the case if we are really objective. The fact 
that Bill Clinton was opposed to the war in Vietnam in the 
1960's (as many people were), the fact that he was in favor of 
lifting the ban on homosexuals in the military, and the fact 
that he is maintaining an image of almost total dedication to 
domestic issues does not mean that he, as commander in chief of 
the U.S. Armed Forces, is not taking "strong" measures for his 
country's defense. 
  Only in this sense can we interpret the activities that 
continue to be periodically conducted by the U.S. Armed Forces 
both inside the continental United States and abroad. 
  According to reliable sources, even though they have pledged 
not to aim their powerful rockets at Russian territory, the 
country's strategic forces periodically conduct massive 
deployments of planes and perform tests of nuclear attacks "on 
powers abroad." They are not exactly doing this to test air 
attacks on Canada, their NATO ally. 
  Some of these "superbombers" head south of Florida as if 
familiarizing themselves with the theater of operations near 
Cuba. Is this part of U.S. defense? 
  They are also deploying their strategic defense systems 
against the nuclear arsenal supposedly launched from Russia. 
Apparently their friendship is not solid enough. 
  The U.S. Navy maintains at its air and naval station in Key 
West, Florida, an "aggressor" squadron of TA-4 and F-16N 
bombers, which have red stars drawn on their vertical 
stabilizers. The stars identify the Russian planes, which they 
imitate. These "aggressors" are used to train U.S. pilots in a 
realistic environment, and there is no doubt that they are being 
trained to fight a well-defined adversary. It seems that not 
only ashes remain. 
  Another example is the existence of units called "opposition 
forces" in training sites at Ft. Irwin, California, and Ft. 
Polk, Louisiana, which have foreign weapons, especially of 
Russian origin. Those units employ the tactics and uniforms of 
that country. 
  The Americans are also trying to exert a direct influence on 
the Russian armed forces. To achieve this they are encouraging 
the implementation of joint maneuvers in the Black Sea, the 
Mediterranean, and the Baltic Sea, as well as visits by B-52 
bombers, the same ones that conduct attack exercises on Russian 
territory, among other activities. 
  These are only a few examples that show that the popular 
saying may also be applied in this case. There were many years 
of intense fire...and some ashes, and perhaps a few fires had to 
remain. Fortunately, for the moment, there are not many...

<F P=106> [By Dihur G. Tchamlesso] </F>
  [Text] With an impressive bureaucracy that includes 22,000 
members, an ultra-sensitive budget totaling nearly $30 billion 
annually, and operating methods usually described as sinister 
and ruthless, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has a 
future role that evokes distrust and uncertainty today. 
  "The CIA's worst of times" is the concise description used 
recently by Wolf Blitzer, a CNN correspondent attached to the 
White House and an expert on defense issues. This is how Wolf 
summarized the low spirits prevailing at the United States' 
foremost intelligence service during an interview last night 
with James Woolsey, director of the so-called "company," who was 
notably vague and elusive when answering questions on the CIA's 
real mission. 
  Can President Bill Clinton trust the classified reports 
prepared daily by the intelligence community especially "now 
when the CIA seems to have lost its soul and is trying to find 
explanations to justify its existence?" Blitzer asked Woolsey. 
  No clear reply came from the top Langley official, who is 
still somewhat confused by the disclosures associated with the 
Aldrich Ames case. Ames, a "mole" or double agent, provided 
extremely sensitive information to Moscow for 10 consecutive 
years prior to and following the Soviet Union's fall. 
  Blitzer says the arrest of Ames and his wife, Maria del 
Rosario Casas, has sparked a scandal and also opened a page that 
reveals not only the fissures and moral decay within the CIA but 
also, from the operational viewpoint, the level of decline in 
internal security control mechanisms, which Woolsey must 
reevaluate. 
  This couple's activities are something of a curiosity, 
because they are now being attributed to "motives of profit" as 
the result of receiving $2,500,000 for selling classified 
information first to the Soviet Union and then to Russia. Ames 
and his wife met and were married in 1985 in Mexico City, where 
both were diplomats. Some time later, Aldrich Ames was 
appointed chief of counterintelligence in the Soviet Union and 
Eastern Europe. 
  He presided over the agency's much coveted and feared 
division located in the lower section of the CIA's Virginia 
executive building. The entrance hall of this building leads to 
a mural lined with 50 stars, each representing agents killed in 
action in enemy territory, according to Woolsey's explanations. 
Most likely the files can attest to a greater number of agents 
killed. 
  According to the charges filed against Ames by a special FBI 
commission, he is suspected of having provided Moscow with the 
names and identities of 10 CIA agents infiltrated into the then 
Soviet KGB; moreover it is believed they were all executed for 
high treason. 
  Certain experts believe Ames is now being used as a 
"scapegoat," because he provides the U.S. intelligence community 
with a reason to implement a witch-hunt with the self-evident 
goal of somehow justifying the predicaments through which it has 
gone, its lack of clear direction, as well as interagency 
rivalries. 
  Now more than ever, the CIA is confronting fierce 
competition 
from other U.S. intelligence services, which include the Defense 
Intelligence Agency (DIA), the FBI, the National Security 
Council, which is attached to the Presidency, and the State 
Department's External Operations Unit. 
  Woolsey seeks to establish more cooperation between these 
agencies, an objective which, according to some analysts, is 
difficult to accomplish. 
  The CIA was created, supposedly, to gather information 
abroad, though it tends to invade the privacy of certain 
individuals' homes. What will it do now in the absence of 
concrete adversaries? 
  In the past, the agency ordered the assassination of foreign 
world leaders and well-known figures, in addition to conspiring 
to topple "hostile" governments. 
  With the end of an open East-West confrontation, the 
"company" lacks a concrete perspective of its real mission. It 
is walking blindly behind confusing and unpredictable objectives 
and goals, such as regional tensions developing in different 
geographical areas. 
  Democrat Oklahoma Senator David Boren, chairman of the 
Senate 
Select Intelligence Committee, said recently it is time to 
define this agency's role. 
  The agency's greatest problem is it mistakenly targets 
numerous objectives, which include drug trafficking, nuclear 
proliferation, or transshipments of missile technology, 
activities which it purports to control, as proclaimed by 
President Clinton himself, in an attempt to redefine the role of 
U.S. espionage. 
  Another objective on which it focuses includes stressing 
intelligence gathering on the latest technological, industrial, 
and economical trends, even from some of the country's own 
Western allies. 
  Before the collapse of the European socialist system, 
Washington assigned 65 percent of the CIA's budget to 
clandestine operations in the USSR and its Eastern allies. It 
presently earmarks 40 percent of the same budget to the same 
purpose.

  [Text] San Jose, 26 Mar (PL) -- Costa Rican citizens today 
forced military personnel from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
to suspend road-repair work in the province of Alajuela. 
  According to a U.S. military spokesman, the work was 
suspended because of protests by residents of Legua de Pital, 
who blocked roads and demanded drains be built to avoid floods 
in the rainy season. The residents also warned that if troops 
continue their work without changing their construction 
techniques, they will organize more demonstrations to stop work 
by the Army Engineers. 
  Meanwhile, a communique issued by the U.S. Embassy in San 
Jose noted that U.S. soldiers will be remodeling and repairing 
several schools in the area over the next few days. The 
soldiers have been in the country since mid-January, 
participating in the annual "Caminos de Paz 1994" maneuvers.

  [Text] San Jose, 27 Mar (PL) -- Vice President German 
Serrano Pinto expressed regret today over the pressure exerted 
against several Central American and Caribbean small states to 
vote in favor of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo for 
OAS secretary general. 
  In remarks made to a Costa Rican radio station from 
Washington where he headed his country's delegation at the 
voting, Serrano Pinto cited his sadness over the coercive 
methods applied against the members of the continental 
organization by a nation he declined to identify. 
  Costa Rica's government officials have not commented 
officially about the outcome of the election, which handed 
victory to the Colombian president with 20 votes cast for him 
and 14 for the Costa Rican candidate, Foreign Minister Bernd 
Niehaus. 
  As Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon charged a few 
days ago, the United States resorted to pressuring the Caribbean 
and Central American states to hand the election to Gaviria, as 
that country regards Gaviria as "a candidate of hemispheric 
projection."

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Maria Elena Gil: "To Be Or Not To Be </F>
Caribbean; That is the Question"] 
  [Text] The delegations from potential Association of 
Caribbean States, AEC, member countries present at the 
constituent technical meeting in Jamaica in mid-March clearly 
illustrate the interests and hesitations that characterize this 
dissimilar group. 
  Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia were there in a clear 
expression of the Group of Three's [G-3] firm intention to 
expand its sphere of commercial influence to the Caribbean. 
  The Caribbean Common Market, Caricom, sponsor of the idea, 
presided over the meeting of experts and drafted the AEC 
charter, which is scheduled to be signed by heads of state and 
government in Barbados next July. 
  Cuba and the Dominican Republic, which have long been trying 
to join Caricom, sent high-level delegations headed by deputy 
ministers and expressed their special interest in expediting 
their integration with the English-speaking Antillean states and 
the rest of the Caribbean Basin member countries. 
  In addition, the disparity between the insular Caribbean 
states and the so-called Latin American intermediate powers, 
represented by the G-3, the powerful members in the future AEC, 
could only be offset by maintaining indefinitely the current 
protective approach by these powers in their relationship with 
the Antilleans. 
  The Jamaica meeting defined terms such as categories of 
participation, membership, goals, main bodies, decisionmaking 
bodies, and financing, all key elements in starting the 
organization, which will include some 38 territories. 
  One of the most intensely debated points was the degree of 
participation in AEC, where relatively developed countries share 
membership with countries barely out of metropolitan tutelage, a 
few of which still are colonial possessions. 
  Apart from the structural differences among the members, 
there persists a consensus on the need to create the AEC as soon 
as possible as a general protection measure against the 
difficult times ahead that will result from large economic and 
commercial blocs. 
  Cuba's participation in AEC, something to which the United 
States objects, was supported by a tacit consensus among the 
participating experts at the Jamaica meeting. Caricom and G-3 
leaders, however, had already made a political decision about 
Cuba's participation as early as 1992. 
  Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Ramon Sanchez Parodi said in 
Kingston: "Cuba believes it has the duty and obligation to 
fully support the efforts to create the AEC in light of Cuba's 
cultural, geographic, historic, and economic ties with the area 
countries." 
  In addition, Mexico, through its delegate Ambassador Luis 
Ortiz Monasterio, said it intends to support this effort and to 
strive to eliminate any obstacles that could hinder the creation 
of the AEC. 
  In the opinion of the experts drafting the document to 
create 
the AEC, another meeting might be necessary before the proposal 
is approved at the ministerial level. Once that stage is 
complete, the presidents of the member countries will officially 
create the AEC during the 15th Caricom summit in Barbados in 
July. 
  This organization, devoted to stimulating cooperation and 
commercial, cultural, economic, educational, and environmental 
exchange, as well as political consensus among its member 
countries, will for the first time begin to paint the dissimilar 
faces of the countries looking toward the coasts of this sea or 
immersed in its waters with the emerald shade of the Caribbean.

<F P=106> [By Nancy Zamora] </F>
  [Text] Madrid, 24 Mar (PL) -- Carlos Lage, vice president 
of the Cuban Council of State, has described as positive his 
working visit that concluded today in this capital city. During 
the visit he met with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and other 
high-ranking members of the Spanish Government. 
  Likewise, in exclusive statements to PRENSA LATINA, Lage 
expressed his satisfaction with the current state of relations 
between Cuba and Spain. 
  The high-ranking Cuban official explained the meeting with 
Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, which lasted an hour and 
a half, allowed him to provide an in-depth depiction of Cuba's 
current situation and the measures implemented on the island as 
well as to analyze bilateral relations. 
  It was also an opportunity to evaluate Spanish investment 
opportunities and perspectives in Cuba and the possibility of 
expanding bilateral cooperation in various fields. 
  During his four-day stay, Lage carried out a very tight 
agenda, which included meetings with Foreign Minister Javier 
Solana, Economy and Finance Minister Pedro Solbes, and Commerce 
and Tourism Minister Javier Gomez Navarro, as well as with Jose 
Luis Dicenta, secretary of state for cooperation. 
  Lage also met with Carlos Solchaga, president of the Spanish 
Socialist Workers Party parliamentary bloc and former economy 
minister. The Cuban official also met with Rafael Portaencasa, 
rector of the Madrid Polytechnic University. 
  We appreciate these meetings and working sessions giving us 
the opportunity to explain the our efforts and how difficult it 
is for us to progress amid U.S. pressures against other 
governments and investors, Lage stated. 
  Likewise, these contacts, he added, allow us to enlighten 
Spanish authorities on the expected Cuban successes in the near 
future in certain fields. 
  According to Lage, this exchange of ideas and opinions is 
also useful, because it offers the opportunity to provide more 
information abroad about the country's progression. 
  Lage explained his visit to Madrid follows a visit by Jose 
Luis Rodriguez, Cuban minister president of the State Committee 
for Finance, who met with representatives of Spain's financial 
institutions last week to discuss technical issues. 
  He said talks with financial institutions from Spain and 
other nations have been taking place for several months now, 
because Cuba is confronting a totally new situation in which it 
must adopt economic measures. In this respect, Cuba is ready to 
assimilate experiences and knowledge from other nations. 
  We are aware conditions are different, because, first of 
all, 
in our case they are occurring within a socialist context; 
second, because Cuba's economic adaptation is taking place amid 
the U.S. economic blockade, the Council of State vice president 
explained. 
  In expressing an opinion on the results of his agenda during 
the past days, Lage said it allowed an interesting exchange of 
ideas with the leaders of the Spanish Government, which, in his 
opinion, is important in many ways. 
  In this respect, he cited, among other aspects, the 
magnitude 
of economic exchange, bilateral cooperation, the possibility of 
expanding the historic closeness between Cuba and Spain, and the 
affinity as well as affection between both countries. 
  Finally, Lage said this contact with the Madrid Government 
is 
not an isolated occurrence, rather, something that will continue 
to ensure greater dialogue and economic exchange between Cuba 
and Spain.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reactions to the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, 
presidential candidate for the Mexican Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, PRI, on 23 March in Tijuana, Baja 
California. 
  The Colombian Government and several presidential candidates 
today rejected the assassination of PRI presidential candidate 
Luis Donaldo Colosio. It has been disclosed that President 
Cesar Gaviria spoke with his Mexican counterpart Salinas de 
Gortari by telephone to express his condolences and to support 
the Mexican Government and people. Dissident liberal candidate 
Enrique Parejo said the assassination proves once again the 
serious threat politicians face when they appear at public 
rallies. Liberal Party candidate Ernesto Samper, who met with 
Colosio a few weeks ago, regretted the assassination and said 
that such violence is the result of "savage capitalism." 
Conservative Party candidate Andres Pastrana also regretted 
Colosio's death. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1636 GMT 24 Mar 94) 
  Lorenzo Menendez, an expert in Mexican affairs at the Cuban 
Foreign Ministry, today told PRENSA LATINA that Colosio's 
assassination caused shock on the island. He extended his 
sympathy to the Mexican Government and people and to the Colosio 
family as well. Such an objectionable action fills us with 
indignation, Menendez said. The news media widely covered the 
tragic event. (Havana PRENSA LATINA 1813 GMT 24 Mar 94) 
  The Nationalist Republican Alliance, Arena, the ruling party 
in El Salvador, today released a communique condemning Colosio's 
assassination and expressing solidarity with Mexican President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Arena repudiated the "cowardly 
assassination perpetrated by antidemocratic forces." Meanwhile, 
Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate of the left-wing Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front, National Revolutionary 
Movement, and Democratic Convergence coalition, at a news 
conference expressed condolences to the Colosio family and the 
Mexican Government and people. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1706 
GMT 24 Mar 94) 
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Burelli Rivas today 
deplored Colosio's assassination and disclosed that he had 
officially contacted his Mexican counterpart to express sadness 
over the incident. Colosio's assassination was widely covered 
by Venezuelan news media today. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1639 GMT 
24 Mar 94)

<F P=106> [Article signed KVB: "Group Occupies Surinamese Power </F>
Station and Takes Staff Hostage"; as released by The Hague ANP 
database] 
  [Text] Paramaribo, 21 Mar (ANP) -- For some hours now, the 
members of a group calling itself the "Suriname Liberation 
Front" have been occupying the Afobaka power station in 
Suriname. They have taken hostage approximately 30 staff 
members of the bauxite company Suralco, who were keeping the 
power station operational. 
  The occupiers are demanding the resignation of the Venetiaan 
government. Their ultimatum will run out on Tuesday at 10 
o'clock local time. The authorities in Paramaribo have not yet 
reacted to the occupation. 
  The power supply could be cut off at any time, informed 
Suralco. The company supplies power to the Suriname energy 
company which provides Paramaribo with electricity. According 
to an anonymous spokesman for the group, a seven-mile stretch of 
the road to the dam has been mined. The dam is located on Lake 
Brokopondo, approximately 100 km from the Surinamese capital. 
  In a telephone call made to a radio station in Paramaribo, 
one of the Suralco staff members among the hostages said that 
the occupiers were demanding "the decentralization of power and 
means of exercising power" and the resignation of the Venetiaan 
government. "If any weapons are pulled out, then the state will 
be responsible for the consequences," said the hostage. 
  The "Suriname Liberation Front" is complaining about 
"economic abuses" and the bad situation regarding education and 
health care. The group wants the activities of the Canadian 
Golden Star company to be reviewed. Golden Star recently 
concluded a contract with the Surinamese Government for gold 
prospection in the area to the East of the dam.

<F P=106> [Article signed JWI: "Surinamese Government Rejects </F>
Ultimatum of Occupiers"; as released by The Hague ANP Database] 
  [Text] Paramaribo/The Hague, 23 Mar (ANP) -- The Surinamese 
Government does not plan to make any concessions to the 
occupiers of the Afobaka hydroelectric power station. President 
Venetiaan said Wednesday evening in a speech to the National 
Assembly (Parliament) that "the government and the Surinamese 
people cannot allow themselves to be blackmailed." 
  On Wednesday afternoon, the occupiers of the hydroelectric 
power station issued a fresh ultimatum to the government in 
Paramaribo, with a final deadline that will run out at 0300 GMT 
on Thursday morning (midnight in Suriname). An anonymous 
commander in chief of the Suriname Liberation Front (SLF) 
declared that President Venetiaan must send his ministers back 
home. If Venetiaan does not do so, then "Paramaribo will 
experience further problems," the spokesman for the occupiers 
said. "We cannot tolerate such useless discussions while the 
population is fighting its way through the problems of the 
economic crisis," he said. 
  However, Venetiaan let it be known that he would not accede 
to any of the demands made by the occupiers. The president 
opted for a dialogue with those responsible for the action and 
said he wanted to resolve the matter "quickly without a great 
show." However, he did not rule out the use of force. 
  "The Netherlands would take any Surinamese request for 
assistance seriously," Netherlands Foreign Minister Kooijmans 
said while speaking in Prague in reaction to the events in 
Suriname. 
  Paramaribo is still struggling with a limited power supply. 
On Wednesday, the SLF shut down three of the six turbines at 
the Afobaka hydroelectric power station, causing the 200,000 
inhabitants of the Surinamese capital to lose three-fourths of 
their electricity.

  [Text] Paramaribo/The Hague, 24 Mar (ANP) -- Official 
sources in Paramaribo (Suriname) reported that the Suralco 
Mining Company workers who were being held hostage were freed on 
Thursday morning during a military operation near the Afobaka 
Dam. There were no casualties. 
  On Monday, members of the Suriname Liberation Front (SLF) 
seized the Afobaka Hydroelectric Dam and held 30 workers 
hostage. They demanded the resignation of the Venetiaan 
government. After the ultimatum had expired, they shut down 
some of the turbines supplying electricity, causing the 
Surinamese capital to suffer a partial power cuts. 
  On Thursday morning, Stanley Rensch, chairman of the Human 
Rights Committee Moiwama '86, responsible for the negotiations 
between the SLF and the government, said that some of the rebels 
had been arrested and others had fled. 
  Rensch confirmed that there had been no bloodshed during the 
Army operation. He added that he talked with one of the former 
hostages, who said that all of the former hostages were fine. 
The human rights activist said he was satisfied with the way 
the operation had been carried out.

  [Text] Montevideo, March 19 (CTK) -- Czech Deputy Prime 
Minister Jan Kalvoda, currently on an official visit to Uruguay, 
met last night with Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle, 
chairman of the Senate and Uruguayan Vice-President Gonzalo 
Aguirro Ramirez, and Supreme Court President Luis Alberto 
Torello. 
  At his meeting with Lacalle, Kalvoda mainly discussed 
economy 
and trade. 
  Lacalle said that Uruguay counted on commercial and 
political 
aid by the Czech Republic, Stanislav Hlavacek, Czech Ambassador 
to Uruguay, told CTK after the meeting. He said that Lacalle 
had expressed his hope that the signing of a Czech-Uruguayan 
trade agreement, scheduled for this summer, might contribute to 
the development of relations between the two countries. The 
signing of a cultural agreement is also expected, Hlavacek said. 
  Torello informed Kalvoda on principles of the independent 
Uruguayan justice system introduced after the abolition of the 
Justice Ministry at the beginning of the 1980s. He said the 
former ministry was strongly influenced by the executive power, 
while the present Court of Justice is fully independent of both 
the president and parliament, Hlavacek said. 
  He said that the discussion between Kalvoda and Ramirez 
focused on the Uruguayan Constitution. 
  Today Kalvoda and other members of the Czech delegation are 
to attend the inauguration ceremony of Irena Mayer, honorary 
consul of the Czech Republic in Maldonado.

  [Text] Sao Paulo (Brazil), 26 Mar (EFE) -- It was disclosed 
today in Sao Paulo that Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso will announce on 29 March his decision to 
resign as minister in order to participate in the October 
general elections as a candidate for the Presidency. A report 
appearing in the newspaper FOLHA DE SAO PAULO discloses that 
Cardoso has already advised President Itamar Franco of his 
intention to participate in the elections. The report adds that 
the minister has told Franco he would use the weekend to hold 
final consultations with his family. 
  Cardoso's decision was confirmed by Pedro Simon, Senate 
government spokesman, who believes the minister will be a strong 
contender. "If today, Cardoso is obtaining a 12-percent 
popularity rating at the polls with the inflation rate at 40 
percent, then most surely, when inflation falls to 12 percent, 
Cardoso will receive a rating close to 40 percent," Simon has 
said. 
  Simon also disclosed that Franco, who discussed the issue 
with Cardoso on 24 March, has promised the finance minister that 
his resignation would not entail changes in the current cabinet 
or the country's economic program. 
  The minister is the mastermind behind the economic 
adjustment 
program, which has been being gradually implemented since this 
past December and which entered its second phase three weeks ago 
with the introduction of a new economic modifier, the real value 
unit (URV). 
  With this program, which is scheduled to be completed in a 
month when the real, a new monetary unit on par with the U.S. 
dollar, enters into circulation, Brazil is seeking to balance 
its public finances, which currently have a $22.10-billion 
deficit. The program also seeks to cut the inflation rate, which 
surpasses 40 percent monthly. 
  "Whatever decision I may make, it will be based on my 
conviction that it is best for the economic program as well as 
for the country," Cardoso told "FOLHA DE SAO PAULO." 
  A commentary that appeared in the same newspaper states 
Cardoso will officially present his resignation on 29 March and 
that the minister will be replaced by Pedro Malan, president of 
the Central Bank of Brazil. The report adds Malan will in turn 
be replaced by Public Debt Negotiator Persio Arida. 
  Cardoso's candidacy is being promoted by the country's 
business sector as well as by leaders of several political 
groups interested in offsetting the presidential aspirations 
momentum of Luis Ignacio "Lula" da Silva, head of the socialist 
Labor Party. For the past year now, da Silva has led public 
opinion polls with a 30-percent preference, and he stands out as 
Franco's most likely successor during the general elections 
scheduled for 3 October.

  [Text] Brasilia -- On 24 March, General Gilberto Serra, 
chief of the Army Ministry Social Communications Center, said it 
is not incumbent upon the Armed Forces to resolve the crisis 
that erupted between the three branches of government. He chose 
to describe the crisis as "a slight disagreement." According to 
Gen. Serra, the atmosphere prevailing in the country merits 
concern but is not serious. The Army spokesman added that Army 
Minister Zenildo de Lucena would have rescheduled the Army High 
Command meeting, which began on 24 March, if the situation in 
the country were truly serious. Gen. Serra said: Had there been 
grave concern, the Army minister would have ordered his 
commanders to stay with their units, and he would have 
rescheduled the High Command meeting, which was scheduled last 
year. 
  The spokesman added that the military ministers believe they 
have already discharged their duty by meeting with President 
Itamar Franco last week to alert him to the atmosphere of 
dissatisfaction in the nation caused by Congress' and the 
Federal Supreme Court's decision to increase their salaries. 
Serra said: They created a group of public servants who, unlike 
the rest of the people, are not affected by the Real Value Unit 
(URV). 
  Serra characterized the meeting requested by the military 
ministers as " preventive action." He said the problem existing 
between the branches of government is of a political nature and 
that it may be solved at any moment through dialogue. He added: 
It is not incumbent upon the Army or the Armed Forces to resolve 
anything. The use of the Armed Forces to defend law and order is 
an exclusive power of the president of the Republic. The 
ministers already have said all that had to be said. The time 
has come to let things calm down. 
  The first day of the Army High Command meeting was devoted 
to 
discussing the list of officers eligible for promotion. Only 
today will Gen. Zenildo de Lucena attend the meeting with the 
eight regional military commanders; Gen. Benedito Leonel, the 
Army chief of staff; and the Army department chiefs. Lucena will 
discuss the national situation and announce the promotion of 20 
generals.

  [Text] Today in Rio de Janeiro, Bishop Luciano Mendes, 
president of the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops, said 
that President Itamar Franco is handling the crisis with the 
judicial branch correctly. According to Mendes, the president 
has been showing goodwill and he is seeking to reach an 
agreement that does not harm the Brazilian people: 
  [Begin Mendes recording] Our expectation is that in such a 
moment [words indistinct] generalized and reach a situation in 
which the Federal Supreme Court, STF, would accept indications 
about the collective agreement renewal date for payment of 
salaries to its personnel; would give up interpreting the 
provisional measure text as if it called for moving up the date 
to convert salaries into the Real Value Unit, URV; and the 
president would see his proposal accepted, as he expected. It is 
expected of the president, however, that he recognizes the STF's 
autonomy and authority. [end recording] 
  Despite disagreements between these government branches, 
Mendes believes the two institutions will be strengthened by the 
crisis and that democracy in our country will become more 
consolidated.

  [Text] Brasilia -- On 23 March, President Itamar Franco 
rejected for the third time an agreement that would have put an 
end to the crisis among the three government branches over the 
conversion of salaries into URV's [Real Value Unit]. The 
agreement, which was negotiated all day on 23 March with the 
active participation of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso [FHC], was officially attacked by Federal Supreme Court 
[STF] representatives, party leaders in Congress, and Attorney 
General Aristides Junqueira. The agreement also depended on 
President Itamar Franco's approval. At the beginning of the 
evening the president said: "No." 
  For the sixth consecutive day, Brasilia awakes to an 
impasse. 
The government would have lost nothing with the agreement 
negotiated 23 March. It established that the conversion of 
salaries for Congress and STF employees would be made on the 
30th of each month, without the additional 10.94 percent. This 
was exactly what the government wanted. 
  All the government had to do was reedit the MP [provisional 
measure], which creates the URV with some changes clearly 
establishing that the salaries of all public employees should be 
converted on the 30th of each month. The change meant admitting 
an executive branch mistake. The STF, which converted its 
salaries on the 20th, would have to retreat from its position, 
but it could argue that it proceeded correctly and that the 
mistake was made in the original MP. Thus, the judicial branch's 
autonomy would have been preserved and the issue would have been 
solved without any more problems. 
<H5>  Meeting </H5>
  The proposal to reach an agreement was made the morning of 
23 
March in the home of Attorney General Aristides Junqueira. The 
meeting held there was attended by Ministers Cardoso (Finance), 
Mario Cesar Flores (Strategic Affairs), STF Justices Sepulveda 
Pertence and Paulo Brossard, and Deputies Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS) 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do Sul], 
Sigmaringa Seixas (PSDB-DF) [Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party-Federal District], and Jose Genoino (PT-SP) [Workers 
Party-Sao Paulo]. 
  The agreement was founded on a basic fact: The crisis could 
develop into an institutional confrontation, threatening the 
development of the democratic system. Everyone present at the 
meeting presented solutions. FHC said he also favored the 
agreement, but that it depended on a decision by the president 
of the Republic. 
  The meeting began at 0930 with the arrival of FHC. Soon 
afterward, Jobim, Flores, and the two justices who had met 
earlier arrived to discuss the situation. The rest of the 
participants arrived soon after. 
  At around 1900, when Congress considered an agreement 
certain, Minister Cardoso announced that President Franco did 
not accept the solution. According to the minister, the 
government will wait for a STF decision on the legality of 
converting salaries on the 20th. Franco did not want to admit 
that the PM was written incorrectly. 
  Consequences of the crisis are unpredictable. So far, the 
conversion of judicial branch salaries was based on an STF 
administrative decision disregarding the executive branch, which 
imposed a cut in workers' salaries. The administrative decision 
may become a court ruling based on suits presented 23 March by 
the judicial branch labor unions and may become a preliminary 
court ruling. With this new situation, instead of disregarding a 
mere STF administrative decision, the executive branch would be 
disregarding a court ruling, thus establishing an open 
confrontation between the two government branches.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Casado] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- The democratic process has really been 
shaken in Brazil. This is the basic and consensual analysis 
conclusion diplomats from industrialized countries sent to 
Washington, Paris, London, and Bonn in the last 48 hours. They 
stated that the institutional crisis -- apparently prompted by a 
minor administrative issue (salaries) -- served to consolidate 
the return of the Armed Forces to the decision-making focal 
point of the political power. 
  There is the possibility of extreme military intervention: a 
coup entailing the closure of Congress and the Federal Supreme 
Court, which are the targets of the executive branch. The 
analysts noted that this possibility is part of the scenario, 
albeit remote. 
  One fact considered most relevant in all reports sent abroad 
was the comment by Admiral Arnaldo Leite, chief of the Armed 
Forces Joint Staff, who said the highest judicial court had 
adopted an "illegal" administrative decision: It converted its 
payroll into URV's [Real Value Units] on the day it paid its 
personnel. 
  Information collected at Congress, the presidency of the 
Republic, Itamaraty, and military units, show that diplomats 
have been trying since the beginning of the week to evaluate the 
course of the crisis under the perspective of elections and the 
constitutional reform. They are unable to answer questions that 
are being discussed in Congress, like: Although part of the 
military is willing to stage a coup with the discreet support of 
some important civilians, would a "strong" government have any 
legitimacy following an armed intervention? 
  Apparently, the military chiefs are more intent on exerting 
governmental tutelage -- like betting on the future 
(presidential succession) -- than on trying to establish the 
conditions for a dictatorship based on a model instituted 30 
years ago. The domestic and international scenario, apparently, 
would not look favorable on them under either possibility. They 
could lack legitimacy at home. A poll conducted in Sao Paulo by 
Toledo and Associates was published yesterday by O ESTADO. It 
shows that only 1.1 percent of those interviewed believe 
"military action" is necessary to solve the crisis. 
  The main international obstacle to intensifying military 
intervention in Brazilian politics would be the U.S. 
Government's alleged desire to prevent nationalist movements in 
the Southern Hemisphere from taking power because they could 
eventually oppose the development of U.S. strategic interests in 
emerging Latin American economies. 
  At the beginning of the week -- with the crisis in full 
swing 
-- U.S. Vice President Al Gore visited President Itamar Franco 
to confirm his government's Another issue shared by foreign 
analysts and Brazilian congressmen -- to which no one has yet 
found an answer -- is as follows: If the hypothesis of a coup is 
unrealistic, what possibility is there for Brazil to make its 
democratic process logical and functional during the closing 
stages of the Franco administration with a strong military 
presence at the epicenter of political decisions? 
  Also highlighted among the common points of the evaluation 
by foreign embassies in Brasilia as well as Congress was the 
level of frustration felt by middle-ranking military officers 
who were aroused by demonstrations of force by the Army, Navy, 
and Aeronautics commanders last week, and which was publicly 
endorsed by the president of the Republic. 
  The consensual conclusion is that the "coup" -- in other 
words, military intervention in the political decisions process 
-- tends to become consolidated in the day-to-day routine under 
President Franco's sponsorship. This domestic atmosphere would 
be favorable because we are witnessing a virtual dismantling of 
the institutions. 
  Itamar Franco -- The president's feeling has been in keeping 
with that of the military. He recently became irritated by the 
legislative and judicial branches' decision to raise their own 
salaries. He believes this is the most serious crisis his 
government has experienced so far, but promises to continue to 
abide by "the law and the Constitution." 
  Octavio Gallotti -- The STF [Supreme Federal Court] 
president 
has changed his habit of talking little. He issues daily 
official declarations and upheld the court justices' decision to 
convert their salaries into URV's on 20 March. He shows little 
desire to negotiate, insisting that the "STF abides by the law" 
and upholds the autonomy of the judicial branch. 
  Fernando Henrique Cardoso -- After negotiating the 
provisional measure to create the URV with the STF, the minister 
was taken by surprise by the crisis. Like Itamar, he canceled 
transfering funds to cover the salary increases. The more 
difficult. 
  Inocencio Oliveira -- The president of the Chamber of 
Deputies has become the mediator in the crisis. He failed in his 
first attempt to overcome the impasse between the executive and 
legislative branches, proposing that the salaries of the public 
servants be transformed into URV's on 25 March. He promised to 
annul the session during which the deputies approved the salary 
increase. 
  Humberto Lucena -- The Senate president changed his mind 
after trying to get the vote on the salary increase for 
legislators included in the order of the day. He has 
participated in meetings to overcome the crisis and asked 
President Itamar to become involved in the negotiations. He 
still criticizes Itamar and Cardoso. 
  Ivan Serpa -- The Navy minister has become the spokesman of 
the military unrest. He called the legislative and judicial 
branches salary increase "immoral." He believes the government 
must not yield to "pressure" or it will become the "slave" of 
other branches.

  [Excerpt] Brasilia -- Deputy Genebaldo Correia (PMDB-BA 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Bahia State]), who the 
Budget CPA [Congressional Investigating Committee] has charged 
with corruption, resigned his congressional mandate on 21 March 
to avoid being dismissed, and thereby, losing his political 
rights for three years. 
  Correia's resignation nullifies a procedure, involving 17 
congressmen incriminated by the CPI, to strip him of his 
congressional mandate. The Chamber of Deputies Constitution and 
Justice Committee (CCJ) has handled the procedure. Genebaldo 
delivered a speech, marked by emotion, in a quiet voice. He was 
unable to prevent shedding a few tears. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Three deputies resigned this morning to avoid being 
stripped of their political rights and from being prohibited to 
run for the next elections. They are accused by the budget CPI 
[Congressional Investigative Committee] of embezzlement and 
malfeasance in office. 
  While the defense witnesses for Deputy Cid Carvalho were 
testifying before the Constitution and Justice Committee, 
Carvalho presented his resignation to the committee. He said he 
resigned because he cannot defend himself against the budget CPI 
accusations. 
  [Begin recording] [Carvalho] I am ready to be processed 
under 
a common civil court, under which I will be tried anyway. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Does this mean the end of your 
political career? 
  [Carvalho] Yes. [end recording] 
  This was the first resignation of the morning. Later the 
plenary hall was informed that two other deputies charged with 
the same crimes also presented their resignation. They are 
Deputies Manoel Moreira from the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic 
Movement] Sao Paulo, and Joao Alves, who was expelled from the 
PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] of Bahia. 
  The three deputies resigned two months after the budget CPI 
decided to judge them. The final CPI report accuses the three 
of embezzlement and malfeasance in office. This is why it 
requested that they be stripped of their political rights for 
lack of decorum. By resigning, the deputies avoid undergoing a 
political trial and a sentence forbidding them to run for 
elections for three years. 
  The Constitution and Justice Committee which met today to 
approve the stripping of political rights of Deputy Joao Alves 
was taken by surprise by his decision. Committee rapporteur 
Deputy Moroni Torgan was this morning trying to make the 
committee members vote on the issue by alleging that the 
resignation is irrevocable only when it is published in the 
congressional bulletin, which has yet not happened. 
  [Begin Deputy Thomaz Nono, president of the Constitution and 
Justice Committee recording] I have listened to the committee. 
As I said before, our action is merely political. The only 
thing the Chamber of Deputies can do is to strip him of his 
political rights. When a deputy resigns like this, even though 
he may deny it, in practice he is really confessing his guilt 
and loosing his mandate which is the political sentence that the 
Chamber of Deputies would have imposed on him. [end recording]

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 24 
March. 
  The Brazilian Petroleum Corporation broke a production 
record 
in February with average production of 702,833 barrels of oil 
per day. The company attributed the increase to operational 
efficiency improvements in Rio de Janeiro's ocean oil platform. 
(Brasilia Voz do Brazil Network in Portuguese 2200 GMT 18 Mar 94) 
  Last year Brazil sold iron ore to 35 countries, of which 
Japan, Germany, South Korea, France, Italy, and the PRC 
purchased 65.4 percent of the 111.861 million metric tons 
produced. Japan was the leading purchaser with 28.329 million 
metric tons, 1.681 million more than in 1992. (Sao Paulo GAZETA 
MERCANTIL in Portuguese 18 Mar 94 p 15) 
  According to Brazilian Institute of Geography and 
Statistics, 
IBGE, estimates released on 18 March, the 1993 GDP totaled 44.87 
trillion real cruzeiros in current value. The economy grew 4.96 
percent. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 19 Mar 94 
Section 1 p 10) 
  The IBGE and the Getulio Vargas Foundation projected a 42.24 
percent inflation rate for March. The consumer price index, IPC, 
was 40.9 percent on 17 March. The IPC for those who earn up to 
eight minimum salaries in Sao Paulo was 45.08 percent, 2.45 
percentage points higher in just one week. The IPC for Rio de 
Janeiro was 43.68 percent, 2.07 percentage points higher. (Sao 
Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 19 Mar 94 Section 2 p 1) 
  The Brazilian Iron and Steel Institute reported that 
Brazilian steel production was 1.964 million metric tons in 
February, a daily average of 70,000 metric tons more than in 
January. Production increased 4.7 percent compared with February 
1992. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 19 Mar 94 p 10) 
  Brazil's trade exchange with Common Market of the South, 
Mercosur, member countries totaled $8.73 billion in 1993, an 
increase of 37.56 percent compared with 1992's $6.35 billion. 
Brazilian exports to Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay were $5.4 
billion; imports were $3.3 billion. The trade balance with 
Mercosur was 11.64 percent more than in 1992. (Sao Paulo GAZETA 
MERCANTIL in Portuguese 21 Mar 94 p 5) 
  The Brazilian trade surplus in February was $726 million: 
Exports totaled $2.778 billion and imports $2.052 billion. The 
Industry, Commerce and Tourism Ministry reported that this is a 
record surplus for February. (Brasilia Voz do Brasil Network in 
Portuguese 2200 GMT 22 Mar 94) 
  Industrial production grew 9.8 percent in January compared 
with the same month last year. It registered the highest 
production level since February 1987, barely 5.2 percent lower 
than the record rate registered in that month. Cumulative 
industrial production grew 14.8 percent from September to 
January. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 22 Mar 
94 p B10) 
  Stock markets dropped because of the crisis between the 
executive, legislative, and judicial branches and high interest 
rates. They decreased 6.19 percent in Sao Paulo and 4.56 percent 
in Rio de Janeiro. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in 
Portuguese 22 Mar 94 p B1)

<F P=106> [Report by Sandra Sato] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- Agriculture Minister Sinval Guazzelli 
announced yesterday that Brazil will have a record grain harvest 
of 73.6 million tonnes in 1994. The estimated production was 
calculated by the National Supply Company (Conab). The minister 
said the record harvest will provoke a drop in grains prices, 
particularly beans, in the next 45 days. Beans were marked as 
the villain in the FHC2 [Fernando Henrique Cardoso 2] Plan 
because prices tripled following the creation of the Real Value 
Unit (URV). Bean prices will "probably drop" again, the minister 
said. 
  Guazzelli said the high price of beans followed a lack of 
rain in bean-producing regions like Irece, Bahia. It is now 
raining in the northeast and the Ministry of Agriculture is 
anticipating that farmers will harvest 1.3 million tonnes during 
this period of "partial harvest." This represents a 66-percent 
increase compared to the same period in 1993. 
  Corn and soybean will help to make the 1993/1994 harvest the 
best in Brazilian history. The minister said corn production is 
up by 2.5 million tonnes and soybean by 1.5 million tonnes. 
Conab figures show rice production is also up by 7.7 percent 
compared with last year, to 10.6 million tonnes. 
  The current record was set in 1990 when total grains 
production reached 71.5 million tonnes. The following two 
harvests fell below 60 million tonnes. Last year production 
reached 68 million tonnes. The numbers announced yesterday are 
only estimates, but the minister trusts the figures. "The 
harvest could even be larger because Conab calculations are very 
conservative," the minister quipped. He added that the country 
has the potential for even larger harvests. 
  While farmers produce their rice, beans, corn, and soybean, 
the government is responsible for ensuring proper storage 
conditions. Last year Conab withdrew the authorization of 
several grain stores due to administration irregularities and 
technical problems. 
  The minister said he does not anticipate any problems 
because 
some grain stores that lost their credentials have corrected the 
problems and again offer their services to Conab. Guazzelli 
figures he will need $2 billion to guarantee the 
commercialization of the record harvest.

<F P=106> [Article: "Every Man for Himself"] </F>
  [Text] Itamar's friends are going their own ways, and 
the Minas Gerais group is coming apart. 
  The "Cheesebread Republic" is no longer the same. The debate 
on the economic plan in Congress has broken up the Juiz de Fora 
group and shown who is holding the ball now: Minister of Finance 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The president's friends from Juiz de 
Fora no longer meet around the chief's desk late every afternoon 
for cheesebread and a bit of chitchat. Itamar is enthusiastic 
about his minister of finance's performance in getting the plan 
approved and has caused his friends to lose the influence they 
once exercised on government decisions. They still have power, 
but they no longer act as a bloc. Each one has started tending 
his own garden. Minister Henrique Hargreaves, the leader of the 
"Republic of Juiz de Fora," is back in command of the Civilian 
Household (see the end of this article). His sister Ruth 
Hargreaves manages the presidential temper with patient work 
that pleases the president. Physician Saulo Moreira is waiting 
resignedly for the administration to come to an end. Attorney 
Jose de Castro, the president of Telerj, wanders around Brasilia 
acting like someone uninformed, although in fact he is much 
better informed than ever. And Minister Mauro Durante is 
worrying about the future. 
  The collapse of the Juiz de Fora group coincided with 
Fernando Henrique's ballet for getting the plan approved. Two 
weeks ago, Itamar was in his office talking to his old friend 
Raul Belem, leader of the PP [Progressive Party] in the Chamber 
of Deputies, and former Minister of Finance Eliseu Resende. At 
one point, Belem ventured a comment: "Itamar, just look at how 
things are. Inflation is rising steadily, interest rates are way 
up there, and Fernando Henrique has the support of the media and 
prestige in Congress." Then, looking to the side, he added: "If 
only it had been that way with you, eh, Eliseu?" The former 
minister was realistic: "Oh, I was at the end of my rope, Raul," 
Eliseu said. A pleased president chimed in: "You are right. 
Fernando is incredible. Incredible. He is very competent." So 
far, Itamar's friends have not shown signs of envying Fernando 
Henrique his power. "We all know our limitations now," says 
Minister of Planning Alexis Stepanenko, a member of the Juiz de 
Fora group by adoption. "That's good because we can do a better 
job with the work before us." Senator Pedro Simon, the 
government leader, has noticed the change in the president's 
conversations. "He is talking to more people," Simon says. 
  Dull life--Now that the Republic of Juiz de Fora has fallen 
apart, some of Itamar's friends have lost interest in power, and 
others are tending to their duties in the corridors of the 
palace. Spokesman Francisco Baker is leaving the administration 
at the end of this month to work as adviser to the IMF in 
Washington, where he will earn $5,000 per month. Physician Saulo 
Moreira, in charge of the policy for reducing the price of 
medicines, is counting the days until this administration ends. 
"I'm going crazy waiting to get out of this" is the scornful 
phrase frequently repeated around the palace. Former 
presidential adviser Thales de Souza Ramos, an anesthesiologist, 
no longer has a guaranteed seat at Planalto Palace. Immediately 
after Itamar took office, Thales spent a long period in Brasilia 
and then was asked to return on several occasions. Now he almost 
never leaves Minas Gerais, and he rarely meets with Itamar. "I 
would rather keep on drinking beer with friends in Juiz de Fora 
than put up with that boring life in Brasilia," he once 
commented. 
  Among those who are still active, special adviser Ruth 
Hargreaves has seen her influence grow. A friend and confidante 
of Itamar's, she keeps the chief in a good mood. On Wednesday 
the 2d, when Congress failed to approve the Emergency Social 
Fund, Itamar was furious. Ruth immediately went into action to 
calm him down. "Don't worry," she said. "I've heard that the 
PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] is going to vote for 
it." Playing coy, attorney Jose de Castro let it be known that 
he was not informed. But he was. Last week he landed in Brasilia 
and followed a well-informed agenda with absolute discretion. He 
talked to the president, held a secret meeting with Sao Paulo 
Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, and held a lengthy 
conversation with Minister Fernando Henrique about the 
introduction of the URV [expansion not given]. Minister Mauro 
Durante is another presidential friend whose influence with the 
president has increased recently as he has filled the vacuum 
left by the departure of Hargreaves. But he is worried about his 
future means of livelihood. "All it will take is a stroke of the 
pen by Lula, and I will no longer have a means of supporting my 
family," the minister confided to a friend. Durante, an attorney 
from Embrapa who was hired under the CLT [Consolidated Labor 
Laws], can be fired by the administration at any time. "We need 
to start thinking about the future," the minister was told by 
his friend Osiris Lopes Filho, whom he had appointed to the 
Federal Tax Office. One adviser at Planalto Palace says: "Itamar 
may arrange a lifetime position for him, perhaps by appointing 
him to a vacant judgeship, before this administration ends." 
  Astral: Itamar himself already regards the current phase of 
his administration as being the last. "I am absolutely convinced 
that this administration will end on 3 October," he told a 
friend during a conversation at the end of January. "From then 
on, the country will have two presidents, and my job will be to 
manage the transition." In view of Fernando Henrique's 
popularity, some of Itamar's friends are concerned about showing 
who possesses the presidential sash. They want the president to 
do more traveling around the country and be seen with the 
people. Itamar is scheduled to spend Carnival in an improvised 
theater box on Marques de Sapucai Street in Rio de Janeiro, from 
where he will watch the Mangueira parade. Then he plans to visit 
Rio Grande do Sul and Sao Paulo. Minister Elcio Alvares had 
another idea. He is organizing a dinner with the president for 
the ministers, since Itamar has abandoned tedious routine 
business. The president currently meets with ministers only when 
something specific needs to be dealt with. "In practice, the 
economy is now being run by Fernando Henrique's team, not the 
president, who works with the minister to formulate general 
guidelines," says one of the ministers. According to another 
adviser, Itamar has finally acquired the notion of limits. "More 
than just learning what a president can do, he has realized what 
he will not be able to do, with the result that he is free of 
the anxiety that existed at the beginning." 
  While his Juiz de Fora friends scatter and others try to 
make 
him look more like a president, Itamar Franco has started living 
on an astral plane. He leaves his office earlier than before: at 
around 2030 rather than 2300 as formerly. He has stopped eating 
with advisers at Planalto Palace and now leaves every day to 
have lunch at home: at Alvorada Palace. He no longer becomes 
irritated at criticism of the government while watching the news 
on television, and he has even started calling his former 
girlfriend, Lisle Lucena, again. Pleased with the approval of 
Fernando Henrique's second economic plan, Itamar is happy with a 
poll whose results will soon be released. It shows that the 
figures on his first year in Planalto Palace are much better 
than Collor's. But inflation, which has doubled under his 
administration, is the most negative feature of his 
administration (see the table). 
  The only episode to spoil the president's good mood last 
week 
was a health problem. According to an announcement by Carlos 
Alberto Oliveira Faria, Planalto Palace's official physician, 
Itamar suffered food poisoning after eating a chicken potpie at 
Alvorada Palace. The person who brought the potpie to the 
president's table claims that the tidbit was in perfect 
condition and very tasty besides. At around 1030 on Sunday, the 
president went out to read the newspapers beside the swimming 
pool at Alvorada Palace and went to sleep in the sun for an 
hour. He ended up with heatstroke.

<H5>  "I've Come Back a Changed Man" </H5>
  Minister Henrique Hargreaves, one of the generals in the 
Republic of Juiz de Fora, is back in the administration. 
Hargreaves left the Civilian Household 101 days ago after being 
accused of involvement in the Congress budget scandal. Since 
nothing against him was proven, Hargreaves took office again 
before a single witness last Tuesday. The minister stationed 
himself beside the bed of President Itamar Franco, who was 
recuperating in Alvorada Palace, and signed the book making him 
chief of the Civilian Household. Soul cleansed, he postponed the 
ceremony until later, when a party held in Planalto Palace 
included the popping of 14 bottles of French champagne. "I would 
not say that I was depressed because of my departure. My feeling 
was one of bitterness," Hargreaves said. 
  At 57 years of age, married, and with two children, the 
minister, who was once a sergeant in the Army, resented his 
forced removal from power. After being accustomed to meeting up 
to 40 congressmen in his office every day and answering an equal 
number of telephone calls, Hargreaves suddenly found himself 
alone and being visited only by a few friends. One of them was 
President Itamar himself, who telephoned Hargreaves a few times 
and visited him on five occasions. During one of those visits, 
Hargreaves was invited to return to the administration. He 
accepted immediately. During his hibernation, he had gone on a 
diet and lost five kilograms, which he has now duly regained, 
and even contacted future clients with a view to reopening his 
law office in Brasilia. 
  Arrogant--Hargreaves always retained a thread of hope that 
he 
would return to power. Mainly because Itamar, besides showing 
him friendly support, never actually installed his successor, 
Tarcisio Cunha. "It was a good time for me to engage in some 
self-criticism," the minister says. "I feel that I made a lot of 
mistakes; I was quite arrogant, but I have come back a changed 
man." All that remains is to convince his opponents. Last week, 
a direct adviser to the president was already spreading venom 
over the minister's return. He said that during his first period 
in Planalto Palace, Hargreaves had been one of the ministers 
making the most use of government jets, mainly on Fridays.

<F P=106> [Article by Fatima Belchior: "Country's Reserves up 5.5 </F>
Percent, Guarantee Supply for 16 Years"] 
  [Text] Rio de Janeiro--Brazil ended 1993 with proven oil 
reserves of 3.8 billion barrels, a volume 5.5 percent higher 
than the 3.6 billion barrels estimated by Petrobras at the end 
of 1992. Natural gas reserves rose from 136.7 billion to 137 
billion cubic meters, an increase of only 0.2 percent. 
  By reaching the level of 3.8 billion barrels (a figure 
representing what it will be possible to produce), Brazil is 
guaranteed a petroleum supply for 16 years if no more is 
discovered and if it continues to extract an average of 700,000 
barrels per day, as it is doing today. 
  If that conservative scenario holds up, the figures are 
quite 
comfortable compared to those in other countries. Although 
worldwide reserves (1 trillion barrels) are sufficient for 43 
years, their distribution is less comfortable for some 
countries. The United Kingdom has enough petroleum for 5.9 
years' worth of consumption, and the United States has enough 
for 9.8 years, according to Dimas Jose Simoes, deputy 
superintendent of operations in the Petrobras Department of 
Exploration. 
  The fact is that petroleum reserves are concentrated in a 
small group of countries. Ninety percent of the world's 
petroleum reserves are owned by only 12 countries (most of them 
in the Middle East). Brazil, which possesses 0.4 percent of the 
total, is in 20th place. And 54.1 percent of the world's natural 
gas reserves, which total 138 trillion cubic meters, is in the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (the former Soviet Union) and 
Iran. In this case, Brazil occupies a modest 40th place. 
  Petrobras's plans for increasing Brazilian petroleum 
reserves 
call for investments on the order of $700 million annually in 
1994 and 1995, according to Celso Lucchesi, the firm's 
superintendent of exploration. Petrobras expects to add 350 
million barrels per year through 1997. 
  In 1992, for example, when the proven reserves in 234 
countries rose by 2 billion barrels, Brazil added 830 million, 
or over half the worldwide volume [as published]. This was 
achieved thanks mainly to Petrobras investments beginning in the 
mid-1980's in the deep waters of the Campos Basin, where the 
company discovered the giant Marlim, Albacora, and Barracuda 
fields. In 1992, when worldwide investments in exploration 
totaled $11.6 billion, Petrobras invested $680 million, the 
equivalent of about 6 percent of that total. 
<H5>  Potential </H5>
  According to Simoes, the 3.8 billion barrels of proven 
reserves may increase to 8.8 billion. The difference between the 
two figures (5 billion barrels) represents petroleum that has 
been discovered but whose volume has not been verified, a 
process that will require additional exploration investments 
beyond those already made. 
  Petrobras also has a third figure reflecting "petroleum 
potential": 18 billion barrels of oil equivalent (including, in 
this case, petroleum and natural gas).

<F P=106> [Interview with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria by </F>
unidentified reporter; place and date not given; from "The News" 
newscast -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] How does a Pereira native, who began his 
political career as a Pereira alderman, feel when he becomes the 
OAS secretary general in Washington? 
  [Gaviria] Many things have happened throughout these years. 
All I can say is that I truly did not prepare myself to be a 
diplomat nor am I an expert in that area. I believe that what 
has happened recently is that the world's agenda has changed 
significantly. As a result, people like me, who are interested 
in economic matters, have begun to stand out in the current 
world. 
  [Reporter] You are leaving the Narino Palace to assume the 
position of OAS secretary general in Washington. Is it possible 
that you will be coming back from the OAS to the Colombian 
Presidency? 
  [Gaviria] [laughs] I am not thinking of that now. It is very 
difficult to think about my life five years from now. In any 
event, I am not thinking of my political future in Colombia or 
anything similar. 
  [Reporter] Do you know that yesterday, when people were 
leaving the OAS headquarters, many Colombians who were carrying 
the flag and singing the national anthem asked Noemi or rather 
called on Noemi Sanin to be a presidential candidate? 
  [Gaviria] The truth is that yesterday's victory is 
basically a victory for Noemi and the Colombian Foreign 
Ministry. There is no doubt about that. This is why I am 
somewhat bothered by references to pressure from other countries 
and the United States. Yesterday's victory was a victory earned 
by Noemi and the Colombian Foreign Ministry, as well as a 
victory earned through her hard work and the way in which she 
toured this continent so many times, making telephone calls, 
working, calling, explaining our positions. 
  [Reporter] Do you see her as a person with the ability to be 
a presidential candidate? 
  [Gaviria] She has the ability to become anything she wants. 
If this hemisphere can recognize her ability and her great 
victory, it is obvious that Noemi has the ability to be 
president and many other things. 
  [Reporter] The United States invaded Grenada and nothing 
happened. It invaded Panama and nothing happened. You will 
have reached the OAS secretary general's office with the basic 
support of the United States. Will you be able to stand up to 
the United States the day the United States again attempts 
something like this? 
  [Gaviria] These things happened because of actions -- 
actions 
that the Latin Americans have rejected and do not agree with, 
such as the actions you have mentioned -- but they also occurred 
because of our lack of action. Both sides are to blame. 
  We have overlooked some of the problems that have occurred 
on 
this continent. We left them alone, as if they were the United 
States' problems, and we ended up with the worst possible 
solutions. Yes, these things happened, but the Latin American 
countries are also to blame, because we viewed these problems 
with a degree of indifference. Today, on this continent, the 
defense of democracy is everyone's responsibility. We all have 
to work to defend democracy on this continent. 
  [Reporter] Does this mean we will no longer see U.S. 
unilateral shows of strength? 
  [Gaviria] I think unilateral actions are totally 
undesirable, 
and I believe that in today's post-Cold War period, no one is 
thinking about unilateral actions. The actions of the United 
Nations itself are the best demonstration that everyone is 
thinking about multilateral actions, but, in order to take 
multilateral actions, all of the countries involved must have a 
willingness to act. In Latin America, we must build on this 
will. 
  [Reporter] Let us return to personal questions. Do you 
imagine groups of people from Pereira will now be going to 
Washington? 
  [Gaviria, laughing] I do not think so. I think they must be 
happy as many other people in Colombia are, but I do not think 
they are going... 
  [Reporter, interrupts] The editorial in Pereira's LA TARDE 
newspaper reads: Pereira, we are going [words indistinct]. 
  [Gaviria, laughing] They are probably happier in my 
hometown. 
  [Reporter] The people here in Colombia felt your victory was 
Colombia's victory. Do you realize that? They did not feel it 
was a victory for Gaviria but a victory for the country. 
  [Gaviria] That is right, and, in a number of ways, I believe 
it should be viewed this way. Because we experienced the 
problems of violence, guerrillas, and drug trafficking in recent 
years, we began to feel uneasy. Within this same period of 
time, however, we made progress in our international policy, 
particularly in our effort to sell Colombia as a country that is 
modernizing, that is changing, that is promoting political and 
economic change. There is a general recognition of this 
attitude and a recognition of Colombia's independent thinking on 
a number international issues. 
  [Reporter] Are you not going to miss the people, the 
country, 
and the food? 
  [Gaviria] I will miss them. Of course, I do not think I will 
miss the problems of the presidency. [laughs] I hope no one will 
escape, and I hope the lights will not go out on me. [sentence 
as heard]

  [Text] Speaking to this station, Costa Rican 
President-elect Jose Maria Figueres offered to cooperate with 
President Cesar Gaviria as the new OAS secretary general and 
said that Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus' reaction 
is purely personal. 
  [Begin recording] [Figueres] I congratulate President 
Gaviria 
and tell him that Costa Rica and other Latin American OAS member 
countries will always be willing to support worthwhile causes in 
Latin America. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Do you think the United States had 
its hand in the election? 
  [Figueres] There was a democratic process in which every 
country voted for the person it regarded as the best to 
consolidate leadership at the OAS. Therefore, I congratulate 
President Gaviria for his victory. 
  [Reporter] Your opinion on Foreign Minister Niehaus' remarks 
on the behavior of other countries' foreign ministers and the 
United States? 
  [Figueres] I am sure that Foreign Minister Niehaus spoke 
from 
a personal viewpoint and that his position does not represent 
the Costa Rican Government's position, let alone that of the 
government that will assume office on 8 May. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by William Cespedes from Washington, DC; from the </F>
"Radio Reloj Newscast"] 
  [Text] Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus was hurt 
after his hopes to become OAS secretary general were dashed. 
Niehaus said the Inter-American system had committed another 
injustice against Costa Rica. The pressures exerted against the 
small countries were the main element that kept Costa Rica's 
40-year-old hope of becoming OAS secretary general from coming 
true. In 1954, former Costa Rican President Otilio Ulate Blanco 
was also defeated when he ran for the post of OAS secretary 
general. On this occasion, the excuse was the OAS needed a 
former president, and the big countries, headed by the United 
States, nominated Colombian President Cesar Gaviria. 
  Foreign Minister Niehaus said the attitude assumed by some 
of 
the small countries in light of those pressures was the main 
element of the defeat. 
  [Begin Niehaus recording] We did have a big problem with 
four 
Caribbean banana-producing countries. This problem has been 
present for some time, but it was used within the last few days 
to separate us and break the vote. We have had a very clear 
position regarding the banana issue. We are working on this, 
and, as far as I know, an agreement was reached in Brussels. 
This was done, however, without disregarding our national 
interests. Our country was interested in promoting my 
candidacy, but it could not do it at the cost of other 
interests. On different occasions I told the banana-producing 
countries our position was one of finding solutions that would 
not affect the Caribbean or our interests; we talked based on 
this issue. 
  Surprisingly enough, since 25 March, when the last 
successful 
contacts were made, these countries started talking about the 
Central American position. They started saying not only Costa 
Rica but other Central American countries were against them. 
What each country does is its own business. We cannot meddle 
in what Guatemala, Panama, or Honduras do about this. This 
began to sound like excuses, but they never told us they were 
going to break the commitment; this happened only today. 
  Yesterday during the Caribbean Common Market-Central America 
meeting support for Costa Rica was reiterated, but those four 
countries said nothing. Those countries are St. Lucia, St. 
Vincent, Grenada, and Dominica. Those countries remained 
silent, so I asked them if they authorized me to tell the press 
everything was all right and that nothing had changed. One of 
them, St. Lucia, said he had not talked about this. I told him 
I was not talking about a specific problem, rather, the vote, 
and he said yes. I then met with you and told you all was fine, 
but there was an underlying problem. 
  Last night I was told a meeting was going to be held and 
very 
faithful and serious countries, countries firm to their 
commitment, such as Jamaica, Trinidad-Tobago, Barbados, and 
Bahamas, said they would do all in their power to fix the 
situation. 
  Shortly before the voting began the St. Lucian ambassador 
came to see me and said there were four countries that were not 
happy with Costa Rica's banana policy. I told him I did not 
know why they were unhappy, because the Costa Rican president 
had been quite clear about this situation. Well, he said, let's 
wait and see what happens. At no time did we say--and this is 
all rumor--Guyana would not support me; quite the contrary, 
yesterday the foreign minister clearly told me he would support 
me. Today he told me he was told to vote against. Well. 
  There was one Central American dissident. I do not want to 
mention the name because I do not wish to harm bilateral 
relations. [end recording] 
  These were statements by Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus at 
the Costa Rican Embassy in Washington after studying the results 
of the election in which he was defeated by Colombian President 
Cesar Gaviria. According to versions heard throughout the 
diplomatic media in Washington, DC, Panama was the Central 
American country that at the last minute changed its vote and 
supported Colombia, as did the four Caribbean countries Foreign 
Minister Niehaus mentioned. 
  This closes another chapter in Costa Rica's hopes to hold 
the 
highest office at the OAS. 
  [Panama City ACAN in Spanish at 1719 GMT on 28 March cites 
San Jose LA NACION as reporting: "Panama broke its promise to 
Costa Rica and voted for Colombian President Cesar Gaviria for 
OAS secretary general." The ACAN report adds "Dominica, 
Ecuador, Grenada, Guyana, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and the 
Grenadines changed their vote at the last minute, thus enabling 
President Gaviria's victory.]"

  [Text] Cuban Consul General to Chile Humberto Hernandez has 
stressed the development of mutual economic and commercial ties 
between Cuba and Chile, notwithstanding the lack of full 
diplomatic relations. In an interview granted to the Chilean 
newspaper LA EPOCA, Hernandez said that since the restoration of 
consular ties two years ago, Chilean businessmen have expressed 
increasing interest in investing capital in the Caribbean island. 
  The Cuban consul to Chile explained that Chileans are 
already 
investing in citrus production and that there are good prospects 
for tourism and companies to supply various products to the 
Caribbean nation. Concerning the reestablishment of full 
diplomatic ties at ambassadorial level, Hernandez insisted that 
the Cuban Government maintains a stance of absolute patience, 
waiting for the Chileans to take the first step.

<F P=106> ["First of a series of interviews" with Lieutenant Colonel </F>
(Octavio Geronez) of the Havana Province Ministry of the 
Interior Office by police reporter Alemany; place and date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Alemany] In Havana Province, a number of measures 
have been taken by Interior Office police to guarantee that 
agricultural products harvested this year will reach the 
population and to avoid their being diverted or stolen by 
unscrupulous people. In this struggle against those who 
illegally get their hands on foodstuffs earmarked for the 
population, the Unified Vigilance and Protection System [SUVP] 
forces play a fundamental role, Lieutenant Colonel (Octavio 
Geronez) of the Havana Province Ministry of the Interior 
[Minint] Office stressed. 
  [(Geronez)] We have formulated a joint plan this year. SUVP 
forces play a fundamental role in this plan, from the community 
level to the provincial level. The objective is to have all the 
products being harvested in Havana Province reach their 
fundamental destinations, either to cold-storage facilities or 
directly to the population for consumption. 
  [Alemany] It has been pointed out that according to 
calculations made in the past, almost 30 percent of the 
agricultural products harvested in Havana Province have gone 
into the underground economy. For that reason, these 
agricultural products did not reach the consumer through the 
local produce markets [agromercados y placitas]. 
  [(Geronez]) The plan we have formulated covers particular 
times or places, basically, from the time the product is 
harvested in the fields to the time the product arrives at the 
cold-storage facility or the product-concentrating site [mercado 
concentrador]. 
  For the moment, SUVP groups have been activated at places 
dealing with the fields, that is to say where the product is 
harvested, taken out of the ground, SUVP groups belonging to the 
miscellaneous crops enterprise, the Basic Cooperative Production 
Units [UBPC], or the community, that is, all SUVP groups that, 
through residency or organization, have anything to do with 
watching over and protecting the product in the fields. That 
vigilance is maintained 24 hours a day until the product is 
loaded onto trucks. They have to guarantee the vigilance and 
protection of those products at the site with their personnel 
and resources and with the methodological help of the comrades 
from the Ministry of Interior. Thieves must not be allowed to go 
there and carry things off and then go and do all the wheeling 
and dealing that they do with these products. 
  [Alemany] Lt. Col. (Geronez) also said that during these 
months of harvesting tubers, vegetables and other products in 
Havana Province, strict controls have been established, among 
these, establishing fixed routes for the trucks. 
  [(Geronez)] Once the product is loaded onto the truck or 
trucks, a set of measures has been taken, measures that cover 
the vehicles' entire travel itinerary, all the way to the 
cold-storage facility or the product-concentrating site. The 
basic elements of the measures are that basic fixed routes are 
established for the trucks to follow. 
  Because of the number of product-producing municipalities we 
have, we have established five basic fixed routes in the 
province. We have given each of these fixed routes a particular 
identification. This identification appears on the documentation 
that every truck carries. For every itinerary, we have chosen a 
color and a number, and this color and number appear on the 
documentation that the driver carries. This permits the 
checkpoints that we have set up to quickly determine when a 
truck is not following the proper itinerary, is off the fixed 
route it should be following. And, precisely, when a truck is 
found to be out of its fixed route, an investigation is 
conducted by the police, to determine the reasons, the causes, 
to see why the truck is deviating from its set route. 
  [Alemany] The second part of this interview with Lt. Col. 
(Octavio Geronez) will be given tomorrow on Radio Progreso's 
"First Thing in the Morning" program, at this same time. This is 
reporter Alemany, on the "First Thing in the Morning" program.

  [Text] Western Army territory is the first military 
community protected from a possible air attack. Today was an 
unusual Sunday for the inhabitants of the Silvio Caro community 
in Bahia Honda Municipality. At mid-morning, an air raid drill 
broke the people's routine and daily chores. Without panic, well 
disciplined, and well organized, each citizen occupied his or 
her place in the people's tunnels. Students and the children 
from a childcare center also demonstrated their preparation and 
knowledge, finding safe shelter in a few minutes. 
  Silvio Caro, with 2,000 inhabitants, is the first military 
community declared protected against a possible enemy air raid. 
In an act of revolutionary reaffirmation, the Western Army 
community staged an emulation action. Division General Nestor 
Lopez Cuba [rank as heard], head of the Political Board of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces, congratulated the inhabitants of 
Silvio Caro and asked them to keep up their efforts toward 
readiness preparation.

  [Text] Havana, 28 Mar (DPA) -- An article published today 
in the TRABAJADORES weekly newspaper indicates that the much 
awaited extraordinary session of the National Assembly of the 
People's Government [ANPP] may not adopt all of the 
controversial measures proposed to clean up the internal 
financial situation and the budget deficits. Entitled "To Be 
Hasty Could Be Disastrous, But Inertia Would Be Fatal," the 
article by Deputy Lazaro Barredo argued that just because there 
are discussions "does not mean we have to adopt all of the 
measures." The session is scheduled for an undetermined date in 
April. Barredo said that it would be better to define basic 
policies for dealing with the various economic phenomenon based 
on specific action. The government can then make the proper 
decisions. 
  The National Committee of the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC] 
will carry out an "in-depth assessment" of the proposals and 
recommendations drafted by the union's chapters in nearly 80,000 
meetings. The CTC will present its conclusions regarding the 
adjustment plan for cleaning up the island's economy. 
  Through the "Parliaments in the Workplace," the Cuban 
Government promoted social consensus in an attempt to keep the 
effects of the economic adjustment measures to a minimum during 
this fourth year of the so-called Special Period. The measures 
being considered include a new taxation system, the end of 
subsidies for consumer goods and services, price increases, and 
a reduction in the size of the government apparatus with the 
resulting increase in unemployment. 
  Since the disappearance of the USSR and the Socialist 
regimes 
in Eastern Europe, with which it carried out 85 percent of its 
commercial trading activity, Cuba has been experiencing a strong 
recession. This is worsened by an increase in the U.S. trade 
embargo. 
  Regarding the more significant issues of the policies to be 
chartered by the ANPP, Barredo believes that although these 
decisions cannot be postponed for very much longer, the 
legislature should neither build false expectations or address 
the matter lightly. The former vice president of the Union of 
Cuban Journalists and current member of the ANPP said that "if 
the measures were capable of immediately solving the difficult 
situation which we have been thrown into, they would have been 
adopted a long time ago." Therefore, he added, it would be 
extremely naive to believe that by discussing and adopting 
decisions made by the ANPP, the country's problems will 
disappear like magic. 
  Besides the partly paralyzed state of industry and the drop 
in agricultural production levels, Cuba faces a budget deficit 
of over $4.2 billion. There is also an excess of currency of 
over $11 billion circulating in the economy. The measures are 
more closely related to the labor situation, more specifically, 
the possible closure of approximately 69 percent of the 
country's enterprises due to inefficiency and the expense caused 
by Cuban workers, who are accustomed to receiving constant 
subsidies from the state. According to Barredo, almost 11 
million Cubans are faced with a dilemma without precedent 
anywhere in the world: how to solve the budget deficit and the 
excess currency problem while upholding the decision to continue 
with free social services, such as education and health. 
  The essay recognizes that the island is facing a necessary 
reorganization process. The process will necessarily and 
inevitably affect the habits, customs, and way of thinking of 
the country's inhabitants. Barredo flat out said that it is 
impossible, under the present conditions, to expect to work on 
the country's economic recovery without getting the domestic 
cash flow situation under control and within manageable limits 
first. "Everything must be carefully studied. It is clear that 
hurrying such important issues could be disastrous, but inertia 
would be fatal." The deputy offered his "personal opinion" in 
an article that covers almost half of the weekly publication's 
center page."

president of the National Assembly of the People's Government 
and Politburo member, has said that one of the clearest 
conclusions of the Parliaments in the Workplaces is that workers 
want to save socialism. Alarcon participated in the conclusion 
of the parliament assemblies in Villa Clara, which concludes 
this process at the provincial level. 
  Speaking to deputies and union leaders in Villa Clara, 
Alarcon de Quesada said that Villa Clara workers agree on the 
need to preserve the achievements of the Revolution and reject 
the IMF formula. Let no one think that capitalist formulas will 
solve the problems of the great majority of the population, he 
said. Alarcon de Quesada went on to say that after four years of 
the special period, there are signs of economic recovery.

  [Text] At the meeting concluding the workers parliaments 
process in Ciego de Avila, Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of 
the Cuban Workers Federation, said that workers parliaments are 
a solid step toward achieving economic efficiency. 
  The development of these parliaments was in keeping with one 
of the principles proposed in that process: to think up measures 
and to act immediately. That is what was discussed in the 
summary of the workers parliament process. The tasks 
implemented, which have already solved specific problems in 
economic and services fields and which were presented to and 
debated by the workers, were also discussed at the meeting. 
  For example, the La Cuba Miscellaneous Crops Enterprise was 
highlighted. In the first two months of this year, the 
enterprise's plantain harvest increased by 18,000 quintals. This 
was achieved with a 135,000-peso reduction in labor costs 
because of the measures adopted by enterprise workers. Similar 
cases can be found in sugar harvest, construction, and services 
activities. 
  Approximately 96,000 workers participated in the parliaments 
that were held at the various work centers of Ciego de Avila 
Province. In these parliaments, ideas to improve economic 
efficiency, restructure domestic finances, and improve 
discipline at the work centers were presented. 
  Meanwhile, at the meeting concluding the workers parliament 
process in Camaguey Province, participants reached the consensus 
that the continuation of the workers parliaments will depend on 
the attention given to the aspects and problems presented at 
each work center. 
  The reduction of agricultural and sugar industry subsidies, 
greater control of resources, discipline, efficient use of the 
work force, and, above all, the need to efficiently produce more 
were topics that were reiterated during the 3,919 workers 
parliaments in Camaguey Province. In evaluating the process of 
the workers parliaments, Pedro Ross said: 
  [Begin Ross recording] We can say that we are satisfied with 
this process, which is now beginning. There are some who say 
that the process has terminated, that is not the case. This 
process is the beginning of a much longer and moire important 
process of following up on the ideas presented by the workers.

  [Text] Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban 
Workers Federation [CTC], chaired the workers parliaments 
summary meeting in Las Tunas Province. The language of 
efficiency was spoken at the work centers in Las Tunas and 
results can already be seen in many of those centers, which are 
directly linked to proposals made by the workers during the 
parliaments. This was demonstrated during the analysis at the 
meeting summarizing the workers parliaments process in the 
province. 
  The Ministry of Agriculture [Minag], for example, has 
increased the personnel directly involved in production by 10 
percent. Minag also hopes to reduce its losses during 1994. 
According to a preliminary analysis, only 14 of its 306 Basic 
Cooperative Production Units [UBPC] will be unprofitable. On 
this, Pedro Ross Leal said: 
  [Begin Ross Leal recording] Because if we are not more 
efficient with the resources we have, we have not solved any 
problem. That is where measures must be taken. [end recording] 
  Approximately 117,000 workers participated in the 2,577 
parliaments held in Las Tunas. Some of the ideas proposed were: 
increasing administrative demands; not subsidizing unprofitable 
enterprises; increasing the creation of UBPC; changing currency; 
and confiscating money and properties obtained through shady 
sources. 
  At the conclusion of the analysis of the workers parliaments 
in Las Tunas, Pedro Ross gave the provincial CTC the banner 
declaring it foremost in the country in the financing of the 
Territorial Troops Militia.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Miguel de la Guardia; from the "Commenting on </F>
the News" section of the "Evening Information Review" newscast] 
  [Text] The elaborate discussions of the economic measures 
that Cuba plans to apply to pull out of the deep crisis produced 
by the collapse of the socialist camp have concluded. The crisis 
has been augmented by the tightening of the economic blockade 
the United States has exerted on Cuba for the past 32 years. 
More than 80,000 workers' meetings were held throughout the 
country to discuss and debate the main economic measures the 
revolutionary government will gradually and in a timely manner 
impose to heal the nation's finances and bring normalcy to the 
people. 
  It cannot be said that even the most humble workers of the 
cities and the countryside discussed the measures because in 
Cuba there are no humble or forsaken workers. In Cuba, workers 
are the most important citizens, the main factor of society. It 
is also true that in Cuba they represent the absolute majority 
of society, a society of workers. Because of this, workers have 
the right to fully participate in the adoption of decisions that 
could affect them, and they fully exercise this right. 
  At the workers' meetings, which were called the Workers 
Parliament, they discussed regulations, taxes, savings, and 
losses and earnings, just as executives interested in having a 
profitable, productive, efficient, and dynamic enterprise do. 
This is what is needed at this critical moment and this will be 
the basis of the country's social and economic life. 
  The Cuban leaders already have in their hands the ideas, 
suggestions, and observations provided by the workers and this 
will be, undoubtedly, an important contribution to the work to 
be carried out in the next few days by the National Assembly of 
the People's Government which will draft laws defining the steps 
that will be adopted to pull out of the current crisis and 
embark on a true economic takeoff. 
  The people already know that the measures that have been 
discussed and announced will mean severe adjustments and 
corrections that will impose sacrifices on the citizens, but the 
people also know that the revolutionary leadership that led them 
to social levels almost unique in the world because it thinks 
about the people and work for the people, will know how to lead 
them based on their most legitimate interests and aspirations. 
All Cubans know that these are not demagogic promises because 
the revolution has demonstrated its stature without ever lying 
to the people, without hiding difficulties and sacrifices, 
always speaking the truth. 
  The recently concluded Workers Parliament process has 
demonstrated the solid unity of the Cuban people at the side of 
the revolutionary leadership, and this is the best guarantee of 
success for any endeavor. There have been many difficulties and 
difficulties will continue. The road ahead is long and 
difficult, but the Cuban people will know how to overcome the 
current problems and victory will be, as always, everybody's 
victory.

  [Text] An editorial carried today in the weekly 
TRABAJADORES says the Parliament in the Workplace assemblies 
have not only strengthened the unions but also buttressed the 
administration, and political and ideological work has also been 
reinforced. The line our population is defending is that of 
finding solutions within socialism, within the social justice 
and equality that the work of the Revolution guarantees. 
  Administrations at the level of centers, enterprises, 
branches, and ministries made a noteworthy contribution to the 
parliament in the workplace assemblies. In a majority of cases, 
they provided serious information and elements that contributed 
to the quality of the analyses made. 
  For its part, the workers movement is obliged to think about 
how to get this method, this work style, to take permanent root 
within its union organizations. The main thing is that 
ideological influence, organizational work, or a thrust toward 
defense or cultural development cannot even be conceived if the 
unions do not participate in solving the economy's real problems. 
  There is no room for pessimism. What we are doing, including 
these Parliament in the Workplace assemblies, is our own victory 
alternative. An editorial carried in today's, 28 March, edition 
of the weekly TRABAJADORES says the initial step has been taken.

  [Text] Politburo member Alfredo Hondal Gonzalez, first 
secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] in Ciego de Avila 
Province, called for efficiency in the sugar industry during a 
plenum of that organization in Ciego de Avila. Hondal added that 
there are real possibilities of being able to meet the assigned 
sugar plan; to accomplish this, the industry must grind 
efficiently, now that the harvest is in its most productive 
period. The plenum also reviewed the results obtained in 1993 
regarding defense, production by local industries, recreation, 
and tourism. 
  With regard to defense, the party plenum highlighted the 
need to increase political work, with the help of party cadres, 
and to boost the work of declaring zones defense-ready in the 
second stage.

  [Text] More than 509 km of telephone lines have already 
been installed in the mountainous areas of Granma Province, 
where 17 percent of Granma's population is congregated. An 
important element of the province's mountainous areas is that in 
1993, approximately 1,700 people moved to areas of the Sierra 
Maestra; so far this year, 300 more people have moved into the 
area. 
  As part of the development of the Turquino plan, the whole 
province is covered by the family doctor plan and education and 
health centers for the population have already been guaranteed. 
The mountainous areas make up 25 percent of Granma's provincial 
territory, of which an area of approximately 900 km has been 
electrified.

  [Text] We have learned that the Galis Bay allegedly left 
Haiti today at noon bound for the Dominican Republic. The Galis 
Bay, a French humanitarian aid ship carrying 530 tons of food, 
arrived offshore on 25 March but could not dock, sources say, 
because National Port Administration [APN] officials refused to 
grant permission. Several people, notably members of the 
Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti, 
have been demonstrating in front of APN offices since 25 March 
to protest the arrival of this ship.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for 
the Promotion and Progress of Haiti] intends to rally a great 
number of people in front of the Port-au-Prince wharf today to 
oppose the unloading of cargo from the French ship. With the 
arrival of this French humanitarian ship, the political 
organization of Constant-Chambelain sees an attempt to turn the 
Republic of Haiti into another Somalia. They made this claim 
during a news conference on 24 March. Rothschild Francois filed 
a report: 
  [Francois] We do not want this charity that France wants to 
throw at us like a bone thrown at an animal after a beating. 
That is the way the FRAPH leader recalled the organization's 
opposition to the arrival of the French humanitarian ship, Galis 
Bay, on 25 March in Port-au-Prince. Emmanuel Constant compared 
this humanitarian aid with an attempt to Somaliize Haiti. It is 
a sop for the Haitian people, asserted the top leader of FRAPH. 
For Constant, it is out of question for the population to accept 
those food products from the French Government. FRAPH attacked 
France's policy toward Haiti. Paris has always demanded a total 
blockade against Haiti, which leads Emmanuel Constant to say 
that France is the leader of the international conspiracy 
against Haiti. 
  In order to make the arrival of the French ship a failure, 
FRAPH intends to put all its weight in the balance. Thus, FRAPH 
is calling for a rally in front of the APN [National Harbor 
Authorities] on 25 March. Emmanuel Constant asserted that FRAPH 
is ready to repeat 1804 [the rebellion against France] by 
preventing the arrival of the French humanitarian aid ship, 
Galis Bay. 
  [Begin recording in Creole] [Constant] Tomorrow we will hold 
a huge demonstration to show the international community that we 
do not want the ship to dock. We want another negotiation. We 
do not want this kind of aid. It is a situation different from 
the Harlan County and is more serious because we do not know 
what is on the ship. The French Government has suddenly decided 
to send food for children. I believe that it is a national 
matter and we are counting on the patriotism of every Haitian so 
that the demonstration is even stronger that the one on the 
arrival of the Harlan County. 
  [Francois] What if the ship docks anyway, despite the 
demonstration? 
  [Constant] The 1804 events were not in vain. We will repeat 
it. I would be ready to accept it. We do not agree, however, to 
accept the shipment from the country that is sending it. This 
is a country in distress indeed. It is due to the embargo, not 
a hurricane. Thus, we should not all of a sudden receive the 
prepositioned disaster relief supplies stocked in Guadeloupe. 
For the past three years, they should have said no to the 
embargo, just like other countries, who are trying to help. 
Brazil is helping us as well as other countries. I do not see 
why they do not realize that the embargo is killing the 
children. That is where the problem lies. We do not want them 
to give us fish. We want to learn how to fish. [end recording] 
  [Francois] FRAPH has announced that it has sent a letter to 
the National Harbor Authorities asking the institution to refuse 
all access to the French humanitarian ship, an initiative 
supported by other political groups. FRAPH also announced the 
start of a large solidarity campaign in favor of the deprived 
people in Haiti, an operation consisting in collecting food aid 
to benefit the deprived. FRAPH indicated two places for 
stocking those food products: at the National Radio station and 
the National Television Station. The leaders of the 
organization hope for the support of members of all social 
classes in the framework of this solidarity movement.

  [Text] If no public and official demonstrations are 
scheduled to take place in Port-au-Prince on the occasion of 29 
March, the U.S. Embassy intends to gather a certain number of 
Haitian personalities and guests for the commemoration of the 
seventh anniversary of the Haitian Constitution. It should be 
pointed out that Senator Bernard Sansaricq has publicly refused 
an invitation by Ambassador William Lacy Swing to participate in 
the 29 March reception. The parliamentarian, who has reproached 
the U.S. Embassy for its interference in Haitian internal 
affairs, has declared that he is in solidarity with the 
contested 18 January 1993 senators. 
  [Begin Sansaric recording] It is with good grace and with an 
immense pleasure that we, senators of the Republic, are able to 
answer this nice invitation. Unfortunately, today everything 
regarding the schemes of the U.S. Government's representatives 
in Haiti seems to reveal their firm determination to work toward 
destroying cohesion between the authentic sons of the Haitian 
homeland. Insofar as a foreign diplomatic representation 
supposedly persists in encouraging us (?to move toward) the path 
of discord on particular and international questions regarding 
the sovereignty of our institutions, we remain sorry to be 
compelled to refuse the honor of this invitation, even though it 
is nice. [end recording]

  [Text] FRAPH, the Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and 
Progress of Haiti protested the U.S. Embassy's initiative to 
organize a ceremony to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the 
ratification of the Haitian Constitution. FRAPH reminds the 
American Embassy that the Haitian Constitution remains a Haitian 
matter. 
  [Begin Emmanuel Constant recording] Given the irresponsible 
behavior of some of our politicians, the U.S. ambassador thought 
it was useful to remind the Haitian political sector, all ot 
them together, that there is a Constitution in Haiti and that 
our country's fundamental law provides very clearly in Article 
1: Haiti is an indivisible, sovereign, independent, democratic, 
and social republic. FRAPH is making a point in referring to the 
tactlessness of reminding all foreigners who are not subtly 
interfering in our internal matters that Haiti's law formally 
prohibits interference. FRAPH urges the Haitian people to be 
more vigilant to safeguard the higher interests of the nation. 
  Therefore, since it is a matter of commemorating the seventh 
anniversary of the vote on our constitution, we invite all 
foreign personalities to carefully read our fundamental law, 
particularly Article 19. As for Haitians who intend to respond 
to this invitation, we tell them that the Haitian nation will 
finally know who are the real stateless persons and who are the 
real collaborators. [end recording].

Malval's government. They have been summoned not to go to their

Constant would be held personally responsible for any attacks in 
which a member of the government might be the victim, with all

signed by interim Prime Minister Robert Malval concludes by 
saying the prime

the other exchanges cannot function either. 
  [Reporter Francois] What kind of problems did exchange 
number 45 have? 
[Spokesman] It is a secret that no one in the telephone company 
has the same difficulties as everyone else because of the 
electricity problem in the country. It is a power problem due 
to the rapid decay of the company's generators, which are by 
definition some spare generators now working an average of 
almost 24 hours a day. Therefore the generators get worn out 
very quickly and break down easily. We had a problem with the 
generator which caused exchange number 45 to break down. This 
caused the other exchanges to break down. As soon as the 
problem was identified, the technicians spent the night working. 
  The service was reestablished as quickly as possible and is 
working now at almost 100 per cent. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] The general manager of the telephone company, 
Mr. 
Pierre Lissade revealed other difficulties that the company is 
currently facing: fuel problems, difficulties in purchasing 
spare parts. Let us listen to Mr. Pierre Lissade: 
  [Begin Lissade recording] We do not just have problems with 
the exchanges. We also have repairs because we are in the rainy 
season. The repair work has increased. If we maintain the 
exchanges without keeping up the repair work, the customers will 
not pay. We are already struggling to make the service 
acceptable since we have great difficulties getting spare parts 
and we have a saturation of the exchanges. We are struggling, 
however, to maintain acceptable service. We have about $90 
million frozen and we must live with the means that we have.

  [Text] The power problem is getting more and more annoying. 
Those who are complaining that they cannot enjoy the service of 
Electricity of Haiti [EDH] are numerous. The fortunes of 
commerce, media, and other institutions are at their lowest ebb, 
waiting for God's help. On that score, we met on 22 March with 
Reynald Delerme, manager and owner of [television station] PVS 
Antenne 16, who did not conceal his concerns given this acute 
crisis. 
  [Begin recording] [Delerme] "There are two ways for us to 
operate: Either we accept being forcesd to slowly stop because 
no more resources are possible or we cope with the situation the 
way it is and decide to work around the situation. As for us, we 
have adopted the second option. When there is power, we work; 
when there is no power, we do not work. 
  [Unidentified reporter] "But EDH has been announcing for a 
few days that there will be power in about two months. This was 
implied. We have noted that there is no power at all anywhere. 
Personally, I am amazed to see Port-au-Prince experiencing 
blackouts. How have you been getting along for these 15 days? 
Have you used a generator? Or have you had some power? 
  [Delerme] "No, as I told you, in Boutiliers [the mountain 
where Port-au-Prince FM radio and television stations maintain 
their transmitters], the power is on at least three or four 
times a week except for last week when it was actually out for 
five or six days. But in general, we manage to work three or 
four times a week. Now, if the power is on at 0600, we work at 
0600; if it is on at 0900, we work at 0900. This is how we have 
managed to work because we are not willing to work any other 
way. To function another way.... [pauses] For the time being, a 
gallon of fuel oil costs $15 to 16. This means the expense has 
increased about 800% and there is no way to impose an 
additional 800% fee on the businessmen for their 
advertisements." [end recording]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 28 Mar (NA) -- Foreign Minister Guido 
Di Tella today admitted that the U.S. Government "is exerting 
pressure" to ensure passage of the law on pharmaceuticals 
patents. He pointed out, however, that "no law is promulgated to 
please that country." 
  In remarks to the Continental radio station, Di Tella said 
the Argentine Government "sent the draft bill to Congress two 
years ago because Argentine interests called for this 
procedure." He added: "A law is not promulgated to please the 
United States." 
  "This is not done in exchange for something. We cannot 
attract high technology or investors without having a law to 
protect patents. It is in Argentina's interest to sanction this 
law," he emphasized. 
  He also said: "A group of enterprises is waiting for the 
patents law to be approved to decide whether or not to invest in 
Argentina." He added: "This law goes beyond the pharmaceuticals 
issue." 
  Di Tella said Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's election 
to 
the OAS secretariat general "resulted from a phone call made by 
President Carlos Menem." 
  Di Tella asserted that Argentine support "determined" the 
Colombian president's decision to run as a candidate. 
  "We could not campaign in his favor unless he presented his 
candidacy. This is what he did and the results were very good," 
Di Tella said referring to Gaviria's elections as the new OAS 
secretary general. 
  The foreign minister explained that the "OAS has progressed 
very much in the last 10 years." He pointed out that the 
organization "helped several countries leave behind undemocratic 
situations." He added: "UN cooperation has been very effective." 
  Di Tella concluded by saying: "We need an OAS working side 
by side with the United Nations. With Gaviria's presence, the 
OAS will be in a more important position to participate in 
discussions about the economy of the region."

  [Text] The Argentine military kept their eyes peeled for 
every gesture that former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 
made during her five-day visit to Chile. What is more, they 
tried to send "all the signals possible" in order that their 
Chilean colleagues might understand that, from this side of the 
Andes mountain chain, "nobody approves of the shows of 
affection" that the Chilean military -- and especially General 
Augusto Pinochet, the Army commander in chief -- have lavished 
on the former Iron Lady. 
  Even what the Argentine military labeled an "accident" made 
the sparks fly. It took place on Saturday, 19 March, on the 
very same day that Thatcher arrived on Chilean soil, when it 
came to the knowledge of several members of the military that 
the plane aboard which the former prime minister was flying to 
Chile -- it was coming from Brazil -- had violated Argentine 
airspace. 
  Thatcher was traveling aboard a Lear jet aircraft belonging 
to the Chilean Aeronautical Directorate. 
  The Argentine military simplified the equation, and 
concluded 
that for them it was a military airplane transporting the 
victorious party in the Malvinas war. And to make matters 
worse, they were sure that the Chileans had not requested 
permission to overfly Argentine territory. 
  Soon afterwards a new piece of information called this 
statement into question. According to another military report, 
the Air Regions Command had given the plane the "okay" to 
overfly our territory. 
  It was already too late. The "day Thatcher passed by 
Argentina" triggered off a sort of symbolic revenge. The 
Chilean Embassy observed the day of the Air Force on Monday 21 
March. By tradition, the chiefs of staff of each of the three 
branches of the Armed Forces attend this ceremony. 
  As a result of a "talked out decision" -- as a military 
source consulted by CLARIN termed it -- Lieutenant General 
Martin Balza, the Army chief of staff, Admiral Enrique Molina 
Pico, the Navy chief of staff, and Brigadier General Juan 
Paulik, the Air Force chief of staff, agreed to "boycott" the 
banquet. 
  The chiefs of staff sent representatives having the rank of 
colonel (or equivalent), a position that is three ranks below 
the topmost rank of each branch. 
<H5>  Difficult Relations </H5>
  President Carlos Menem yesterday underscored "the excellent 
relations" existing between Argentina and the United Kingdom. 
  The military seemingly share the president's view. Despite 
this, Thatcher's trip to Chile showed them that what they call 
the "Chilean military buildup" is the most bitter pill for them 
to swallow. With very little trouble the Argentine military are 
able to quickly enumerate all the military equipment purchased 
by the Chileans over the last two months: 
  -- 40 Storm vehicles with anti-tank armament capability, 
from Israel. 
  -- two ships for transporting troops, with a capacity for 
300 men each, from the United States. 
  -- six CASA freighter planes, with a capacity of 24 men 
each, from Spain. 
  And it is said that they are contemplating the purchase of: 
  -- two frigates from Great Britain. 
  -- 20 Mirage aircraft from Belgium. 
  -- New uniforms for the entire Armed Forces personnel that 
cannot be detected by infrared equipment. 
  According to the Argentine military, the above list proves 
that the "regional balance" is a concept of the past. From this 
utterance, there is only a short step to demanding of the 
government a speedy reequipping of the Armed Forces.

<F P=106> [Article by Omar Baez] </F>
  [Text] Under close monitoring by Presidential Secretary 
Eduardo Bauza, Manuel Mondino, National Commission for Atomic 
Energy [CNEA] chairman, and Energy Secretary Carlos Bastos have 
begun the path toward the restructuring and privatization of the 
CNEA. 
  The meeting was held 22 March at Eduardo Bauza's office. 
CNEA Chairman Mondino and Bastos agreed on the main aspects. 
They defined three essential points: 
  -- The state will create an institution that will regulate 
the granting of licenses for operation of the new power plants, 
the enforcement of safeguard clauses for operational safety, the 
implementation of basic research, and the fulfillment of 
international agreements on the subject. 
  -- One (or several) corporations will be created for the 
operation of the nuclear plants and for the implementation of 
the other productive activities currently performed by CNEA. At 
the beginning the corporations will be totally state-owned, but 
the Economy Ministry is studying how to privatize them. The 
model in which Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo's team is most 
deeply interested is that used with YPF [Government Oil 
Deposits]. 
  -- The state will be held responsible for nuclear damage and 
for the resolution of the problems caused by radioactive waste 
and the dismantling of closed plants. The financing of these 
activities will be made on the basis of fees, while private 
enterprises operating the plants will designate the state as the 
beneficiary of specific insurance policies. 
  Mondino's CNEA so far monopolizes all nuclear activities, 
concerning both research and development and the generation of 
energy. A commission made of members of the Energy Secretariat 
(Ministry of Economy) and of the CNEA will now evaluate the 
various alternatives for structuring and organizing the 
entrepreneurial sector. 
  The commission has one year to complete the restructuring 
work. Thus far the only decision is that the nuclear plants and 
CNEA productive activities will be regulated by the legislation 
applying to the private sector, and that they will have private 
capital, in competition with the other enterprises that generate 
and sell power on the market. 
  It still remains to be decided whether a corporation will 
run 
the entire business, or whether there will be several 
corporations that will take care of individual plants and 
activities. For example, it is possible to rapidly call for 
offers for selling nuclear fuel. The CNEA has already contacted 
foreign enterprises that are interested in buying fuel, and some 
of them might buy it. 
  Other matters concerning this uncertain situation have to do 
with whether there will be anyone willing to operate the 
Atucha-1 or Embalse plants, which are 12 and 20 years old 
respectively. Won't privatization of nuclear fuel as a separate 
business make the rest of the deal unattractive? Or to what 
extent will possible buyers want the state as their local 
"partner" with the CNEA men who are now running the plants? The 
answers to these questions will determine the method for 
transfer to the private sector. 
  Yet it is certain that the next nuclear plants for which 
licenses will be granted will have fully private capital and 
that, sooner or later, the private sector will buy part of the 
shares of the plants that are operating. 
  This point, on which the two officials agreed, seems 
useless, 
because no nuclear plants are now being built in the world 
(except for Atucha-2). Yet according to the projections of the 
businessmen of the sector, the nuclear business will flourish in 
the first years of the next century. And they want to have a 
free path at that time. 
  Another important fact is that construction of Atucha-2 will 
be completed in two years, with national budget funds. 
  The meeting on 22 March closed a harsh phase in which the 
Economy Ministry and the CNEA confronted each other over 
leadership of the sector. It was a dispute over control of a 
budget allocation of more than $1 billion; Cavallo had almost 
not even had a chance to learn how this was allocated. At the 
same time the leadership of the only productive activity that 
had not sunk with the shipwreck of the state was at stake.

  [Text] A Foreign Trade Ministry study indicated that the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) poses a risk to the 
integration of Colombia with Mexico. The study also indicates 
that NAFTA, of which Mexico is a part, will cause difficulties 
for Colombians exports to access the Mexican market because the 
Mexican doors will swing open for very competitive U.S. products. 
  Should the agreement within the Group of Three (G-3), made 
up 
of Colombia, Venezuela, and Mexico, not materialize, the 
situation will worsen because our country will even lack 
preferential access to the Mexican market. This is why the 
study states that "the G-3 will have no value whatsoever unless 
it is reinforced by the incorporation of Colombia into NAFTA" 
and by the subsequent establishment of a Latin American economic 
bloc. 
  The costs of excluding Colombia from NAFTA will be huge, not 
only because the advantages of having access to one of the 
world's largest markets would be lost, but because foreign 
investors would prefer to conduct businesses in Mexico, not in 
Colombia. According to the study, more than half of the capital 
flows allocated to Latin American investments in the next few 
years will go to Mexico because of the preferential access that 
businessmen and exporters will have to enter the U.S. market. 
  Preliminary estimates indicate that Mexican exports to the 
United States will increase by an additional 15 percent 
annually; the Mexican economy will grow by an additional 11 
percent; and real salaries will increase by 16 percent. The 
study also reveals that products of the chemical and publishing 
industries will be the Colombian products most hurt by Mexican 
preferences for the United States because of the differing NAFTA 
and G-3 schedules 3 to lift customs duties. 
  The report indicates that "the message is clear for Colombia 
if we consider that the NAFTA inclusion conditions are 
relatively flexible. Second, the integration agreement reached 
so far must be included within the most ambitious plan, whose 
ultimate goal is hemispheric integration." Colombia recently 
asked to join NAFTA. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
said Colombia will probably be included on the list of countries 
that want to join NAFTA. The list will be officially submitted 
to President Bill Clinton on 1 May.

<F P=106> [Interview with presidential candidate Ruben Zamora of the </F>
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, Democratic 
Convergence, and National Revolutionary Movement coalition by 
Mauricio Funes at the station's studios in San Salvador on 22 
March during the "Up to Date" newscast -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Funes] Good morning, viewers. Welcome to "Up to 
Date's" interview segment. As we announced on our newscast this 
morning, we have with us today Dr. Ruben Zamora, presidential 
candidate for the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front], CD [Democratic Convergence], MNR [National Revolutionary 
Movement] coalition. Welcome, Doctor. 
  [Zamora] Good morning, Mauricio, and good morning to 
everyone 
watching and listening to us this morning. 
  [Funes] This is the first interview I have given following 
Sunday's elections, and it is the first comprehensive interview 
with one of the two candidates who will definitely compete in a 
runoff election, judging by the results which, although they 
have not been declared final by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal 
[TSE], show a trend that will be difficult to change because 
they reflect over 75 percent of the votes counted nationwide. 
  As of last night, the TSE's figures gave 49.20 percent of 
the 
vote to ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance]; 25.73 percent 
to the coalition; and 15.95 percent to the Christian Democratic 
Party. In your opinion, Doctor, what do these results mean? 
  [Zamora] The first implication, Mauricio, is that the 
strategy we established a year and a half ago when we initiated 
this process is working. We said at the outset that a coalition 
of progressive democratic forces had to be formed that would 
allow us to move ahead and win first or second place, then move 
on to a runoff election. We have accomplished those things and 
we will now implement the second part of our strategy, which is 
to broaden this coalition of forces so we will win the 
presidency in the runoff. [passage omitted] 
  [Funes] It came to our attention yesterday that the Chamber 
of Commerce president said it is unfortunate that El Salvador 
must hold another election for just a few points. If ARENA had 
won a simple majority of the vote, it would unquestionably have 
won the elections in the first round. Do you agree with that 
party's view that it is an unnecessary effort and expense to 
hold a runoff election? 
  [Zamora] I do not think so. Perhaps the Chamber of Commerce 
president did not use the right words about a runoff election. I 
believe just the opposite is true. Elections are a democratic 
exercise by the people. They are an opportunity for the 
Salvadoran people. We should welcome every opportunity the 
people have to express their will and choose a government. That 
is the essence of democracy. The very thought that elections are 
somehow unfortunate could be very dangerous and end democracy in 
the country. I would say that we must hold the runoff elections 
with the attitude that they are an opportunity to broaden our 
political knowledge and the information given to the people and 
to truly try to involve more Salvadorans in the decision. 
  You must remember that 49 percent is percentage data, but 
half of the population has not voted. In other words, 49 percent 
in terms of the voting population is less than one-fourth of the 
Salvadoran electorate, and it might not be a good idea to 
believe that an election should be decided by less than 
one-fourth of the people who should be making the decision. It 
is to our advantage to have another opportunity to correct all 
the serious deficiencies of the first election so we can broaden 
the spectrum and allow more Salvadorans to decide their future. 
  [Funes] The distribution of support demonstrated in the 
presidential elections was practically predicted by the public 
opinion polls. All polls indicated that ARENA was the top force, 
followed by the leftist coalition and the Christian Democratic 
Party [PDC] in third place, approximately six months ago. They 
did not, however, predict the percentages and the way they would 
change. For example, the UCA's [Central American University] 
Public Opinion Institute gave the coalition a certain percentage 
that was way below the ARENA figure. Do you think the 49.20 
percent is a solid ARENA vote? 
  [Zamora] It is not a solid ARENA vote because I think the 
polls were showing something different. I think a lot can be 
attributed to the occasional vote, due in part to the fear 
instilled in voters by a campaign carried out toward the end. In 
fact, it was a campaign held on a day when campaigning was no 
longer allowed. Certain media, like EL DIARIO DE HOY, continued 
a harsh campaign against us. I believe it was outside the 
boundaries permitted by law or that it bent the law over 
backwards. All of this had some impact, and that is one of the 
things that we want changed in the runoff elections. In other 
words, we do not want the kind of campaign where a party 
officially shows one face but then pays a front organization to 
do the dirty work, the derogatory campaigning against another 
party. 
  I think all these elements had some influence, but I also 
insist that there was a large number of new voters who we feel 
supported us but who could not find their names on the list, 
their numbers did not match, their names were misspelled, that 
another person had already voted there, or people whose names 
simply did not appear on the lists. 
  [Funes] Dr. Zamora, no one can deny that the left has won a 
political victory by the fact that there was no clear winner in 
the first round of elections, thus forcing ARENA to go to a 
second round. What will be the practical impact, from the 
standpoint of political pragmatism, of going to a second round 
when, if you add up the percentages, regardless of the efforts 
made by the leftist coalition, the percentages received by the 
PDC and other political parties would still not come close to 
the 49.20 percent received by ARENA in the first round. 
  [Zamora] We must keep something in mind: The results of one 
election will not necessarily be the results of the next 
election. We are witnessing that throughout Latin America. 
Second, our strategy is not only to add other parties -- we will 
obviously try to do that -- but to guarantee that the large 
number of voters who were unable to vote in the first round will 
be able to do so in the second round. The runoff election will 
be an opportunity to see that our electoral system is not so 
exclusive. It will become an open electoral system that will 
allow people to vote instead of a system to prevent people from 
voting. Our hopes and efforts lie in the affluence of new voters 
as they are the ones who will create a new scene next month. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Funes] I want to analyze some of the irregularities 
observed yesterday. I heard Onusal [UN Observers for El 
Salvador] Chief Augusto Ramirez Ocampo say that, generally 
speaking, the elections were acceptable. Despite the fact that 
there were some irregularities, when the elections are 
considered acceptable, when missions from different countries 
and international organizations finally reach the opinion that 
the elections were acceptable, any irregularity they may have 
detected simply becomes a logistical problem, some of which are 
considered normal and others simply the product of an 
organization that is still new. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal 
was created in the wake of the peace agreements. I would like to 
discuss the possible impact of the irregularities that prompted 
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front to hold a news 
conference on the same day of the elections but which at the 
same time led Onusal to state that the elections were generally 
acceptable. 
  [Zamora] I believe that is where part of the problem lies. 
If 
the option is between acceptable elections and fraudulent 
elections, obviously the elections were not fraudulent. No one 
has characterized them as such. We would not term an election 
fraudulent in which we have become the country's second 
political force with people participating for the first time in 
the country's history. This must be given due consideration. 
The problem is not whether the elections were fraudulent or 
acceptable. The problem is, as the United Nations pointed out -- 
and I think it is the correct term and share it -- that the 
elections were held in adequate conditions of liberty, 
competition, and security despite the serious organizational and 
purity deficiencies noted beforehand. In other words, what these 
organizations had the first time around were serious 
deficiencies; not simple, but serious. Such deficiencies can be 
corrected. That is the important thing, Mauricio. 
  I think we must face the problem with a positive attitude. 
These are things that can be corrected, so let us correct them 
for the good of the Salvadoran people. We have a great 
opportunity to do it now; so let us do it. I think everything is 
directed at that goal. We must recognize one thing: There were 
no complaints of general fraud in the '91 elections. There were 
complaints of local fraud. Now the problem is centered on the 
serious deficiencies of our electoral process. Such deficiencies 
can be corrected. 
  In essence, the deficiencies impeded people from 
participating. Let us look, for instance, at the 200,000 people 
who could have legally participated. Our count here in El 
Salvador shows that 10 percent of the people did not participate 
because they did not appear on the register because of problems 
such as a lack of a voter registration card and so forth. Okay, 
200,000 people can totally change the percentages. In fact, they 
could have changed the percentages in the primary and could 
still change them in the runoff elections. It could have been 
the case. I think, however, their participation would have 
reduced ARENA's percentage and increased ours. That is my 
observation. Right now we cannot say, but we can say that those 
problems must be corrected quickly. [passage omitted] 
  [Funes] One objection that persisted and which surfaced 
publicly during the campaign by the Liberty and Democracy 
Institute [ILYD] was the FMLN's past. Do you think that if this 
is not handled properly, no matter how civilly the FMLN conducts 
itself these days, if it is continuously brought up, it will 
make a large sector of the population afraid? 
  [Zamora] Yes. In fact, that is something we must look at in 
the runoff election. I do not think it is right for ARENA to 
promote this type of propaganda, through the ILYD, which is paid 
by ARENA. It has its station announcers, and we know that the 
ILYD and ARENA make their advertisements at the same place. They 
are sort of name borrowers. We have seen them campaigning 
wearing an ILYD sweatshirt, and when they get into the truck, 
they are wearing an ARENA sweatshirt underneath. In that sense, 
they are ARENA supporters. I do not think it is right for them 
to do that. If ARENA wants to campaign that way, they should do 
it and we will respond appropriately. If ARENA wants us to 
debate the impact of the war, what it meant, what each person 
did for the war to take place, we can discuss it in the runoff 
elections. We have told Dr. Calderon Sol time and again that we 
are interested in a lofty debate, an in-depth debate on the 
country's problems. 
  One of these problems is our past, which we must discuss 
face 
to face with the people. The ARENA gentlemen, however, totally 
reject a debate. They do not want to show their faces. They hide 
behind an institute that continued to do what they were doing 
despite a warning from the TSE to stop. We do want the TSE to 
adopt a clearer and more energetic attitude against the low, 
dirty, and illegal campaigning by this so-called institute 
before the runoff elections. 
  [Funes] Aside from the legality or illegality of this type 
of campaigning, I am talking about what is being said. 
Organizations that support the FMLN or organizations that could 
be on the left always drag out reports on the past war or 
resurrect the death squad activities. The death squad topic was 
somehow in the political debate when the secret documents were 
declassified. The position, then, should be that either both 
forces should forget about discussing the past and stop delving 
into it, or if one drags out reports on death squad activities, 
then the other drags out the report on the war, or vice versa. 
  [Zamora] That is exactly what we have tried to avoid. It 
would not have cost us anything to get copies or facsimiles or 
whatever of the documents released by the State Department, the 
Pentagon, and the CIA, but we wanted to avoid that. We did not 
think it conducive to focus on for our people. It would have 
turned the past into a battlefield instead of a field of 
experience. Mauricio, we want to move on. We must look back, but 
we should do it without slinging mud at one another. We must 
take a serious look at the past. That is what we want. I am 
personally opposed to engaging in that type of propaganda which 
is so common in our country. One is either a terrorist or a 
death squad member. That sort of thing does not educate our 
people. It causes us to regress. I am convinced that, rather 
than winning or losing an election, the important thing is to 
move forward. Democracy in our country can only be cemented on 
firm foundations. I do not think it is a firm foundation to 
insult one another. On the contrary, that would be the worst 
basis upon which to try to develop democracy. I insist that we 
must ask ourselves whether what we are doing for the country is 
good or bad. Another way is to have an in-depth discussion of 
the war in a serious manner, with arguments. I am ready to 
engage in such a discussion at any moment with Dr. Armando 
Calderon Sol so we can clear things up. 
  [Funes] I think fears about a lack of guarantees are 
fundamental. No matter how much one appeals for an electoral 
process in which the voters vote for certain projects, one often 
wonders whether the candidate he chooses is in a position to 
resolve the country's problems? I think that in this case it is 
asking for more than voters are able to give, considering 
traditions and past elections when people were afraid so they 
asked for guarantees. I understand there are fundamental sectors 
of the country, such as the private sector, that ask for 
guarantees. The armed institution asks for guarantees. The 
social sectors and the labor sectors also have certain fears, 
and certain candidates ask for guarantees. This is something 
that might be relevant in the runoff election. 
  In that sense, there is the case of the Armed Forces. I 
spoke 
with the defense minister the other day and asked him what the 
victory of one party or another could mean for the Armed Forces, 
but basically what a leftist party would mean. He insisted that 
there is some fear in view of the past. It is a reasonable fear 
because the parties are asked to consider the armed institution 
as something permanent, as a key organization in the country's 
development. How would you face such fears in light of what the 
Armed Forces' role might be? 
  [Zamora] I think that the only way to handle fear, 
personally, socially, or collectively, is face to face. In other 
words, we have to recognize that the Armed Forces and its 
officers are concerned about the triumph of a coalition that is 
formed in part by a component that the Armed Forces faced 
militarily for several years. I think we must confront our fears 
by making things clear. My view of what the next five years 
should entail for the Armed Forces is to complete what has been 
called the demilitarization process. The first two years have 
been what we might call the negative part of the process: 
purging, downsizing, separating policemen and Armed Forces 
members, redistributing the constitutional role assigned to the 
Armed Forces, and so on. Now comes what I would call the 
positive part. In my opinion, it must be based on two 
fundamental pillars, the first being recognition that the Armed 
Forces is a legitimate institution in this country. Its 
existence and function are provided for in the Constitution. It 
is the government's job, in this case the president's job, to 
make sure that the people accept the institution's legitimacy. 
  That is the fundamental pillar upon which relations will be 
rebuilt. Equally fundamental is recognition that the armed 
institution's policy must be subordinate to the decisions of the 
power elected by the people, in this case the civilian power. 
The armed institution must be totally isolated from party 
politics. Based on those two premises, we must rebuild the 
relationship between civilians and military personnel to make it 
a modern relationship in which civilian-military relations will 
no longer be a problem. It should be a nonissue like relations 
between lawyers and nonlawyers. No one worries about that 
situation. We must reach that point when society accepts a 
military career as a valid profession with a valid role in 
society. 
  [Funes] Have the two parties that faced each other and led 
the war matured? For instance, I have heard officers say they 
are afraid that a majority in the Legislative Assembly could 
vote for a constitutional amendment to eliminate the armed 
institution. Such a proposal was on the agenda some years ago. 
  [Zamora] Regardless of whether the parties have matured, I 
look at it this way. We are on the path to building maturity. I 
do not think we not achieved it yet. If we had, the problem 
would have been resolved. We are in the process of resolving it. 
It will be a difficult process, but I think we are clear about 
what we are aiming for and what must be resolved. As for 
eliminating the Armed Forces by a constitutional amendment, I 
think that is totally senseless. A constitutional amendment in 
this period has to be made by consensus. It is not a question of 
majority. It would be the most serious mistake if a majority, 
because it is a majority, were to introduce a constitutional 
amendment that is opposed by another important part of the 
country. Why? Because it would destroy what we have achieved in 
this country, which was to change the Constitution by consensus 
among everyone. This heightens the awareness of the need for 
consensus in our society. We must not abandon this. There can be 
constitutional amendments here so long as they are approved by 
consensus. Even if we had a majority to pass it, if a sector of 
society or a part of the Legislative Assembly opposes it, I 
think we have to forget about the majority because that is the 
new style of government that we propose. [passage omitted] 
  [Funes] I want to close with this question. Yesterday a CNN 
reporter asked you -- the interview was broadcast yesterday -- 
if there was any difficulty going from the right to the left. 
That is a topic I have tried to explore in the past few days 
prior to the elections in terms of governability. Will the 
coalition you represent be able to create the conditions for 
governability? 
  [Zamora] That is precisely the point. If we talk about of 
moving from right to left, we are going it about it the wrong 
way because the country is not moving from right to left. There 
is a fundamental historical fact: The right and the left sat 
down and signed peace agreements. This puts the center of the 
dispute in our country not between right and left but between 
those who want to progress toward the new things that will 
emerge from the peace agreements and those who would like to 
return to the past. I think that is where the problem of the 
primary elections lies. The electoral struggle dealt with the 
path from the left to the right. I disagree with that approach 
because it leads to a false polarization in the country. If 
there is going to be a polarization in the country, it must be a 
polarization in the new terms. The interest is not in whether 
there is going to be a government of the right or of the left 
because there will not be a leftist government in El Salvador. 
It will be a government of the past or the future. ARENA 
represents a government of the past that says: I am in command 
and you will obey. We represent a government of the future born 
from the spirit of the agreements. We are all going to work 
together and seek a national consensus to take the country 
forward without exclusions. This, for me, is the real and 
central point that we must explain clearly during the runoff 
elections, because I think it will help clarify the country's 
real situation. 
  [Funes] We thank you for your visit this morning, Dr. 
Zamora.

  [Text] After long hours of waiting and lengthy discussions 
with members of the departmental electoral boards, at 
approximately 1900 last night, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal 
(TSE) reported the official results of the presidential election 
in La Paz Department. According to TSE President Luis Arturo 
Zaldivar, the results widely favored the governing Nationalist 
Republican Alliance Party, which obtained 35,081 valid votes. 
The leftist coalition of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front, Democratic Convergence, and the National Revolutionary 
Movement obtained 12,409 votes, and the Christian Democratic 
Party obtained 12,557. 
  The remaining political organizations obtained the following 
votes: Authentic Christian Movement, 462 votes; Unity Movement, 
1,505 votes; National Conciliation Party, 5,820 votes; and the 
National Solidarity Movement, 542 votes. According to the report 
provided by the departmental boards, the total number of votes 
contested was 256; 4,280 were annulled for several reasons; and 
1,903 voters abstained. 
  The TSE president said those were the first official results 
he could provide because the departmental boards discuss every 
case to reach an agreement. He said, however, he had personally 
asked the board members to speed up the counting process so as 
to give the people the final results of the presidential 
election this afternoon. He added once the vote-counting process 
ends and the TSE reports those results, the tribunal will 
immediately proceed to make the legal call for the second round 
of the presidential election, in accordance with the 
Constitution and electoral law.

  [Text] While the signing of an overall agreement on human 
rights with immediate verification between the General Command 
of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity [URNG], the 
Guatemalan Government, and the Army is imminent, the two sides 
continue discussing the final text of the document, according to 
a CERIGUA dispatch. 
  Luis Becker, a member of the URGN's Political-Diplomatic 
Commission, said the document's signing will mark a new phase in 
the country's social and political life, where daily practice 
will determine whether it is possible to reduce the gap between 
the proposals on human rights and the devastating reality the 
country has faced. 
  Becker did not give any details of the agreement, but he 
described it as a positive step and a victory for the Guatemalan 
people, as well as a victory for all sectors that have struggled 
to maintain the values and principles of real democracy.

  [Text] On 23 March, the Guatemalan National Revolutionary 
Unity [URNG] issued a seven-point statement discussing the 
national situation from its perspective. At first, it says that 
the circumstances that existed at the time President de Leon 
Carpio began his mandate no longer prevail and that the people's 
expectations have once again been sneered at because, as in the 
past, the military and economic powers still dominate the 
country's fate. 
  The URNG claims that the government's partiality is evinced 
by comparing the prompt solution given to the demands of fuel 
carriers and the owners of urban transportation vehicles with 
the police and Army suppression on residents of Santa Lucia 
Cotzulmaguapa, Escuintla. The indifference shown regarding the 
murder of a religious leader in San Lucas Toliman, Solola, and 
the manner in which the government deals with the demands of 
state employees are other examples. 
  The URNG also refers to the support the president has given 
the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols [PAC], and his willingness to 
serve military interests through rewards and salary increases 
denied others. It stresses the lack of resources in hospitals 
and the violent removal of people that invade lands, which very 
much follow the pattern set by predecessors Cerezo and Serrano. 
  The URNG points out that the attack on the San Juan River, 
at 
the 20-km marker of the Atlantic Highway, was perpetrated by the 
military itself, thus reflecting the existing division in the 
Army which was confirmed by General Quilo Ayuso in his statement. 
  The URNG indicates that the current crisis of 
ungovernability 
actually seeks to trigger social explosions, like the one in 
Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa, to prolong and increase suppression 
and to impose a state of exception. The possibility of a coup 
d'etat, however, should not be discarded. Last, it warns PAC's 
not to lend themselves to the suppression of popular demands 
because if they do, as has happened until now, they will be 
attacked by the guerrillas to break, in this manner, the truce 
declared with them.

  [Text] New Government Minister Danilo Parrinello Blanco, a 
lawyer, will implement an emergency plan in the next two months 
which seeks to solve security problems in three specific areas: 
drug trafficking, kidnapping, and the permanent crime which 
affects the masses. When asked about his first activities as a 
member of the security cabinet, Parrinello Blanco outlined his 
emergency plan and emphasized that we cannot expect a miracle, 
meaning Guatemala cannot become the safest place in the world in 
24 hours. He clearly said he will be strict, but he will abide 
by the law. He added that under his leadership, he and the 
security forces will respect human rights and work with honesty 
and without arrogance, disrespect, or abuse. 
  Nevertheless, he said that although no miracles are 
expected, 
he is sure his emergency plan will make it possible to stabilize 
the country's security sector in two months. He explained that 
this entails orienting all crime prevention measures in three 
specific areas. The areas to attack are kidnapping, drug 
trafficking, and the crime that is now part of the citizens' 
daily lives -- attacks on bus passengers and pedestrians, for 
example. 
  Minister Parrinello Blanco said that although violence and 
crime affect all Guatemalans, they mainly afflict the poorest 
people. The majority of them take to the streets and only 
protect themselves by making the sign of the cross and putting 
themselves in God's hands. I am interested in establishing 
conditions that protect everyone, particularly the people who 
worry about traveling by public transportation or walking to the 
bus stop or those who are being mugged at this moment. 
  He insisted that his main goal is to improve conditions for 
everyone's safety but special emphasis will be given to the 
masses who carry their bimonthly pay or the money to buy the 
children's medicine or food in their pockets. Generally 
speaking, Minister Parrinello Blanco said he intends to act 
firmly so the state may guarantee the life and assets of all 
citizens. He also said he will act "with honesty and integrity, 
and without disrespect, abuse, or arrogance. We will be strict, 
but we will abide by the law," he insisted.

  [Text] Ironically, Armed Forces Commander Luis Alonso 
Discua has voiced opposition to President Carlos Roberto Reina's 
proposal to convert our military service into a voluntary one. 
Discua Elvir said the term voluntary can only be used to refer 
to going to the movies. The military commander also talked about 
the Armed Forces' ability to assist the public prosecutor in 
locating missing people. [passage indistinct] 
  Referring to the Armed Forces' budget, he noted it had been 
significantly reduced and now amounts to approximately $33 
million. Asked about Honduran Ondina Cea, who fled Iran because 
her father-in-law kept her in captivity, and the possibility of 
Iranian terrorists in Honduras, the officer said he did not have 
information on these matters. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Today, the 
Honduran's lawyer [words indistinct] charged there could be 
Iranian terrorists here. 
  [Discua] Yes, as I have already told you, I do not have any 
information on this. You have caught me a bit off guard. I did 
not get any information on this when I arrived. We will take the 
necessary measures once we have the appropriate information.

  [Text] According to President Reina's private secretary

and educational military service does not represent the military 
institution's position. This is how the president's office has 
reacted to General Discua's saying he did not know why this type 
of military service was being proposed if young people do not 
even want to go to the movies voluntarily. 
  [Begin secretary recording] Any opinion which differs from 
that of the commission, which will study this issue, will have 
to be taken to the Bipartite Government-Armed Forces Commission 
so it can reach an agreement. [end recording] 
  The conflicting statements clearly show, however, at the 
very 
minimum there is a lack of clear communication between the heads 
of the executive branch and Armed Forces. 
  [Begin secretary recording] Especially if they say how the 
country will stand on an issue which is of general interest, 
particularly for young people; this is easily resolved, however.

  [Text] Managua, 28 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the Nicaraguan 
Government ruled out any changes in relations between the "big 
and small" countries of the Americas following the dispute 
within the OAS over the election of its secretary general. The 
election of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria as OAS secretary 
general took place after reports that there was friction between 
the countries that supported the candidacy of Costa Rican 
Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus and those who supported the South 
American president. "Although Nicaragua maintained its support 
for the Costa Rican foreign minister, Gaviria's election will 
not alter relations," said a spokesman for the Nicaraguan 
Foreign Ministry. 
  North and South American countries supported the candidacy 
of 
the Colombian president, while Niehaus had the support of 
Central America and the Caribbean countries. According to the 
Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gaviria "is a very skillful and 
capable person because of his position." Gaviria will be leaving 
his post on 7 August when he turns it over to the president 
elected on 29 May in Colombia. 
  Today, the Nicaraguan press, on its front pages, emphasized 
the election of Gaviria as well as the frustration of Niehaus, 
who harshly criticized the United States for exerting pressure 
on countries that had committed their votes. Analysts had 
forecast that the battle over the secretary generalship of the 
hemispheric organization was a battle between the "large and 
small countries" of the Americas, and that no representative of 
Central America had ever occupied the post of OAS secretary 
general.

  [Text] As far back as 2,500 years ago, political 
philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, Thomas 
Hobbes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Jefferson, 
James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Karl 
Marx devoted their thoughts to issues on ethics, sovereignty, 
social engagement, human rights, governmental corruption, the 
balance between liberty and order, and others. Only Niccolo 
Machiavelli was concerned about the art of government as it is 
and not as it should be. He specifically called attention to an 
overpowering phenomenon, the offspring of power, which he 
labeled the "foolishness of the leader," that is, the 
self-destructive mechanism that makes a leader fail, beginning 
at a specific critical point in time, because his commitment to 
power weakens him at a rate directly proportional to his 
performance. 
  General Humberto Ortega has always been a remarkable 
Nicaraguan, both politically and militarily, and his presence 
became more meaningful even during the revolutionary transition. 
Beginning with the "Camilo Ortega of the Gringos [as 
published]," however, he began walking a path toward his own 
foolishness, which has now culminated with his voluntary 
appearance before the Military Prosecutor's Office, which he 
commands. In addition, he voluntarily waived a very significant 
part of his military authority "directly linked to military 
jurisdiction." 
  The consequences of his foolishness were overwhelming and 
imminent: He was arrested. Although it was a "precautionary" 
arrest, he lacks the right, as is done with potential offenders, 
to leave his house, city, and country. Is this the self-destruct 
principle? We do not know for certain yet, but we are wondering. 
<H5>  Helms' Geniegate </H5>
  How did Gen. Ortega allow himself to get involved in this 
case by behaving in an manner contrary to reason, contrary to 
the nation's best interests, contrary to his irreproachable 
behavior, and contrary to a clear analysis of the situation? He 
said he did it in the name of ethics and morality, but in this 
case, these issues should never have arisen. The general was 
definitely aware that the "Genie Case," at least in terms of the 
form it assumed after being mishandled, had nothing to do with 
the sad incident that shortened the life of young Jean Paul 
Genie. Gen. Ortega knows, as every prudent person in Nicaragua 
knows, that this case is being manipulated from the United 
States by those who, as a letter stated, "have attempted to 
subject to their whims the dignity and pride of Nicaraguans for 
more than a century. [no closing quotation marks as published] 
  Bringing Gen. Ortega to court must have made the Jesse 
Helmses of the world lose sleep. I am sure of this. A couple of 
months ago, a prominent U.S. Embassy spokesman in Nicaragua told 
me that North Americans would accept many things from the 
Chamorro administration; they would not accept, however, that 
Lenin Cerna stay in the country and that the Genie case go 
unpunished, not because of the case in itself, but because it 
was the most direct way to fatally hurt Gen. Ortega, just as 
Watergate hurt Richard Nixon. 
  U.S. strategists must now be "surprised" by Ortega's 
foolishness in facilitating the plot they devised to destroy 
him. As of this moment, Gen. Ortega is indeed under house arrest 
for a crime he did not commit. We do not know what will happen 
tomorrow because the Nicaraguan Week of Wailing began after the 
Judases of Camdessus, Alexander Watson, and Inter-American 
Development Bank President Enrique Iglesias left. Iglesias 
promised to lend $500 million to finance three years of 
development in Nicaragua, and the black box of the ESAF 
[Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility] is still pending. 
<H5>  A Plan To Destroy </H5>
  Judases! It is ridiculous that millions and millions of 
dollars that belong to Nicaraguans, according to a resolution by 
the International Court at The Hague, remain frozen in the 
vaults of the U.S. Treasury to ensure that the vaults of our 
Central Bank remain criminally empty, thereby leaving the 
Chamorro government vulnerable to all sorts of blackmail. 
  Indeed, the Week of Wailing has begun. Anything can happen 
because the enemies are awake, and they are sending no flowers. 
Regardless of what happens, however, they can be sure about one 
thing: All of Latin America is behind Gen. Ortega and his 
foolishness. Regardless of the consequences of Gen. Ortega's 
foolishness, Latin America is supporting him by firmly waving 
the Bolivarian flag of independence, self-determination, 
democracy, and development with social justice. Latin America is 
committed to Gen. Ortega because of everything he was as well as 
everything he was not.

<F P=106> [Commentary by dismissed JS Deputy Coordinator Violeta </F>
Delgado; for related reporting on this issue see FBIS-LAT-94-038 
pp 19, 20] 
  [Text] In the national committee during the 1993 evaluation 
session for JS [Sandinist Youth] activities, we decided, based 
on the need to define new strategies and political actions that 
would enable us to achieve greater success in 1994, to increase 
our involvement in the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation 
Front] Extraordinary Congress and our work in middle education. 
  On 3 and 4 February three working committees were formed to 
prepare reports on these issues for the National Council, taking 
into consideration the grass-roots discussions held in each 
department. Thus a consensus agenda was approved, and the 
National Council session was scheduled for 19 February. 
  However, suddenly a devious maneuver took place, an ambush 
prepared by some small departmental groups, led by the Managua 
delegation, which persuaded the National Council not to discuss 
the points on the agenda, but only one point: the internal 
strengthening of the JS. 
  The National Council was persuaded to discuss issues that 
Managua had been working on for the last eight months. A 
document different from the agenda document was presented, 
prepared by the Managua general secretary, using biased 
arguments that had nothing to do with what the national 
committee had approved for presentation to the council. 
  In the discussion it was said that the JS coordinator and 
deputy coordinator should be removed; the discussion on how we 
should now be preparing for our work with Nicaraguan youth was 
simply ignored. 
<H5>  Ambushing Unity </H5>
  There was a vote. The Chinandega departmental 
committee--which had only five of its 19 comrades present, and 
because of financial problems had been forced to make a 
selection of its delegates--also fell into the ambush that had 
been prepared, and withdrew in protest, as did the delegations 
from Granada and Leon. 
  This has created a definite division in Sandinist Youth, a 
division brought about by the National Council, even though we 
have been strong advocates of remaining open-minded and not 
taking positions on the different currents of opinion in the 
FSLN. 
  We have been promoting a JS leadership that works to 
strengthen the party, without trying to back or strengthen 
individual personalities in the front, but rather the party as a 
whole. 
  In the vote, 45 voted for the partial removal of the 
national 
committee--this included the coordinator and deputy 
coordinator--and 34 were opposed to this action. It was 
suggested that the secretary for international relations be left 
in place so as not to disrupt work in this area. 
  The consequences for JS are now sadly negative: there has 
been an obvious polarization. For example, Bluefields and Esteli 
were not present and Nueva Segovia and Rivas were opposed to the 
results of that vote. The Matagalpa delegation's vote was 
divided, and only Managua voted unanimously. 
  According to the bylaws, the only thing the National Council 
can do, once 70 percent of its members are in agreement, is to 
convene an Extraordinary National Assembly to choose new 
national officers. 
  This is going to have a negative impact on our international 
relations, as we serve as the vice president for youth in the IS 
[Socialist International] and in COPPAL [Permanent Conference of 
Latin American Political Parties]. Damage has already been done 
both to JS and to the FSLN itself. 
<H5>  Seeking a Mature and Honest Solution </H5>
  The saddest thing is that in order to bring Sandinist Youth 
into line with a particular position in relation to currents of 
opinion in the FSLN, they had to get rid of those of us who 
thought and who continue to think that JS should be broad and 
openminded, and that instead of taking positions, it should help 
create consensus within the party. 
  This action has been instigated by a group that proposed 
that 
Sandinist Youth be defined and guided on the basis of a position 
in the FSLN. It would not have happened if the general 
coordination of JS had already taken one position or another 
among the FSLN currents of opinion. 
  JS should not ignore the debate, but it should try to focus 
the debate within the confines determined by the FSLN's organic 
roots, without trying to create a position of dominance for a 
specific current of opinion. Unfortunately, this has already 
created a clear division among youth. 
  The only solution that I see now is for each departmental 
committee of Sandinist Youth to discuss this situation with its 
grass-roots members, and with the national leaders who were 
disregarded, because in no department was there any discussion 
with the grass-roots members about a decision that emanated from 
the Sixth National Assembly of Sandinist Youth held in November 
1992. 
  The grass-roots members are the only ones who can decide on 
new Sandinist Youth officers. I appeal to all JS members to 
demand their right to decide in such an important situation. It 
is up to the members of JS to seek a political solution that is 
viable, acceptable, mature, and honest.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Fernando Naranjo, foreign </F>
minister-designate in the government of President-elect Jose 
Maria Figueres Olsen, by Jose Alberto Briceno; place and date 
not given -- part two of two] 
  [Text] The turmoil the country has experienced in its 
relations with the United States since last year will apparently 
come to an end on 8 May, when Jose Maria Figueres takes office. 
According to Figueres' Foreign Minister-designate Fernando 
Naranjo, one of his main tasks will be to improve the 
deteriorated relations. 
  "We have viewed with concern a deterioration of relations 
with the United States. This country is definitely our main 
economic partner and has been our political ally for many 
decades," Naranjo highlighted in an interview with LA REPUBLICA, 
in which he explained the main goals of his tenure. 
  The future foreign minister said in a decisive manner: "We 
do not like the cooling of diplomatic relations between the two 
nations, and we deem it necessary that we will be able to talk 
with the United States as friends and to overcome any 
differences. This will permit us to have a close and respectful 
relationship." 
  Since last year, a series of differences have cooled 
relations with the United States. However, according to 
experts, the situation started when the administration of 
President Calderon Fournier endorsed former U.S. President 
George Bush in the election won by Democrat Bill Clinton. 
<H5>  Moment of Tension </H5>
  Tensions soared in February of last year, when the United 
States threatened to block a package of credits from the 
Inter-American Development Bank because of delays in settling 
land expropriation payments for U.S. citizens, particularly 
those related to the Santa Elena Farm. 
  Additionally, in July 1993, the U.S. Commerce Department 
ruled it would process a suit filed against the Costa Rican 
Government over alleged labor rights violations. 
  The litigation was suspended because of a visit to 
Washington, D.C., by Presidency Minister Rolando Lacle, during 
which he pledged to fulfill a series of demands presented by the 
powerful AFL-CIO. 
  This year, the threat of economic reprisals continues 
because 
of the legal dispute involving cellular telephones and the 
Millicom Corp., as well as the resumption of the lawsuit by 
national unions over alleged noncompliance with proposed 
legislation. 
  Anticipating a scenario that could turn critical for the 
national economy, Naranjo stressed: "We are going to work with 
different ministries. If there is a labor problem, the Foreign 
Ministry will work with the Labor Ministry. If there is a 
commercial problem, we will work with the Foreign Trade 
Ministry. Also, we will analyze any problem concerning 
intellectual property rights with the Ministry of Justice or the 
Ministry of the Presidency." 
  Naranjo added: "We are not trying to replace other 
ministries, but these coordination efforts must be led by the 
Foreign Ministry." 
  The strategy to be implemented with the United States will 
be 
one of improving political ties, because "people settle their 
differences by talking to each other. If one speaks and makes 
proposals, there will be an understanding, while if no 
discussion is held and one's arguments are not explained, there 
will be disagreement and relations between the nations will tend 
to deteriorate," Naranjo asserted. 
  Naranjo said that along with improved relations with the 
North Americans, he will promote a national dialogue on the 
impact of Costa Rica's possible integration into NAFTA. 
  He said: "We have to think seriously about whether or not we 
should join the trade agreement, because it would mean seriously 
reforming the environment, labor laws, and the property system." 
  He added: "I have the impression that some people are 
nonchalantly recommending we join NAFTA without thinking about 
the cost of doing this. This is why I think there should be a 
national consultation. Only after we have discussed this matter 
with every sector can we engage in suitable negotiations." 
  Naranjo said he personally believes it will be good for the 
country to join NAFTA because it would offer guarantees to 
investors and open new markets. "The question is when and how 
this should be done," the economist said. 
  Naranjo said the next government will make "great efforts" 
to 
strengthen its economic and commercial ties with Central America 
but will remain opposed to a political union. 
  He said: "In the face of the challenges ahead, a small 
country such as Costa Rica can do very little by itself. We 
believe that there is strength in unity and that we must push to 
secure regional agreements on important issues, such as the 
marketing of bananas and coffee, as well as trade relations with 
Europe and NAFTA." 
  The idea is, he said, "to consolidate Central American 
positions" on these issues by way of trade talks being held with 
other Latin American countries, such as Colombia and Venezuela. 
  Regarding the rejection of political integration on the 
isthmus, Naranjo said it should not be sought until there is a 
national agreement on it, something that does not exist now. 
  According to experts, Central American resentment toward 
Costa Rica derives from the current government's decision to 
separately initiate international efforts toward agreements, 
such as a trade pact with Mexico and the United States. 
  At the past summit of Central American presidents in 
Guatemala City, it was decided, as a conciliatory measure, that 
those nations participating in regional integration efforts must 
inform the other countries in the region whenever they initiate 
trade talks with countries outside the region. 
  The future Costa Rican administration will seek the 
formation 
of a bloc to discuss financial and economic issues of interest 
to 30 million Central Americans.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Briceno] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus has demanded the 
Nicaraguan Government stop collecting tolls in La Trinidad, 
across from the mouth of the Sarapiqui River, on the San Juan 
River, because that zone is protected by provisions of the Canas 
Jerez Treaty. 
  The Sarapiqui River flows into the San Juan River, and 
according to treaty stipulations Costa Rica has the right of 
free commercial navigation. 
  Niehaus said the government has contacted Nicaraguan 
authorities at that location but has yet to receive a 
satisfactory answer. 
  The minister sent a note to Nicaraguan Ambassador Alfonso 
Robelo stating, according to information available to the 
government, a toll is being collected. 
  Niehaus has said he instructed "all Costa Rican authorities 
at the border area to try before Nicaraguan authorities to solve 
this problem while ensuring full respect for Article 6 of the 
Canas Jerez Treaty." 
  The Costa Rican Foreign Ministry has stated the constant 
problems stemming from the use of the San Juan River were 
discussed by the bilateral technical group of a cooperation 
agreement signed by the two governments during a meeting in San 
Jose on 14 January. 
  The ministry has added no satisfactory answer has been 
received, although misunderstandings had apparently been cleared. 
  Niehaus contacted his Nicaraguan counterpart, Ernesto Leal, 
this week to voice his concern over this problem, but Leal told 
him Nicaragua is charging no toll along the waters of the San 
Juan River, which are shared between both countries. 
  Relations with Nicaragua have been tense this week; in fact, 
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo has denounced the fact Costa 
Rica's Agrarian Development Institute (IDA) is distributing land 
to peasants in Nicaraguan territory.

<F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] According to Ruben Dario Carles, presidential 
candidate for the Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement, 
National Renewal Movement, and the Civic Renewal Party, Panama 
should suspend debt negotiations with private banks. Professor 
Carles has said that although the government has stopped trying 
to reach an agreement on the foreign debt with commercial banks, 
these efforts will now limit the financial actions of the new 
government. Therefore, the next president, whoever he may be, 
and his team will have played no role in those negotiations. For 
this reason, he hopes these negotiations are suspended 
immediately. 
  [Begin recording] [Carles] Despite the goodwill and great 
effort made by the negotiatiors -- and I admit that the work 
done so far by Delia Cardenas, planning and economic policy 
minister, is very commendable -- I feel it would be advisable to 
immediately suspend those talks. 
  [Reporter] Why? 
  [Carles] The country is not in any condition to take on the 
responsibility of paying 3 billion balboas and to obtain, if 
possible, a special consideration or adjustment. I think we can 
achieve our goal of being in a better position later. [end

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections 
scheduled for 8 May 1994. 
  Ernesto Perez Balladares, Democratic Revolutionary Party 
(PRD) presidential candidate, toured Arraijan District on 17 
March where the various communities 
greeted him. When asked about the foreign debt issue, he said 
"the debt was used for great works during President Torrijos' 
time, but the current government has handled it irresponsibly." 
(Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 17 
March 94) 
  While touring the corregimiento of Calidonia on 23 March, 
Perez Balladares said the other presidential candidates who are 
trying to unite the political force to undermine his 
presidential candidacy in the 8 May elections "will fail." Perez 
Balladares said his opponents were once united against Noriega, 
but now nothing is holding them together. (Panama City LA 
ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 24 March 94 p A1) 
  Ruben Dario Carles, Change 94 presidential candidate, has 
visited a mining company which is seeking to exploit gold 
deposits in Canazas, Veraguas Province. Carles then told the 
community he requested the company pay just salaries and conduct 
reforestation programs. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in 
Spanish 2300 GMT 17 Mar 94) 
  Carles has vowed to defend the continuity of democracy and 
reduce energy rates. At a rally in Tole, Chiriqui Province, 
Carles promised he will revise energy rates. Carles said: "We 
must reduce energy rates; energy service is too expensive and 
inefficient." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 
2300 GMT 21 March 94) 
  Carles is reportedly recovering from an accident he had on 
22 
March and therefore is limiting his political activities. 
Carles and a group of supporters fell from a balcony, and he 
reportedly twisted his ankle. Although his health was not 
endangered, Carles was advised to rest until his swollen ankle 
improves. Regarding this mishap, Carles concluded: "We have 
talked with other candidates to adopt appropriate measures to 
prevent people from continuing to live in old, rundown homes." 
(Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 23 
March 94) 
  Carles has requested the national government "to immediately 
suspend the renegotiation of the foreign debt with international 
banks, as it is unadvisable and extemporaneous," adding the 
government "should concentrate all of its efforts until 
September on attaining free elections which will pave the way 
for the new president and his team." (Panama City LA PRENSA in 
Spanish 24 March 94 p 2A) 
  Should she win the 8 May elections, Mireya Moscoso de 
Gruber, 
Arnulfista Party (PA) presidential candidate, has promised she 
would revise the minimum wage. De Gruber announced her intention 
after visiting several communities throughout the country where 
she found there is economic stagnation due to an increase in 
basic market products. De Gruber said: "Our government program 
establishes, after assuming the Presidency on 1 September, that 
we will conduct an in-depth and prompt study on the minimum 
wage. We must increase the minimum wage." (Panama City Circuito 
RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 17 March 94) 
  In statements to the newscast "Telemetro Reports," de Gruber 
has admitted that political forces have become polarized between 
the PRD and the PA. Given this situation, de Gruber reiterated 
her call to all political parties to form one single political 
coalition behind the PA so as to confront the PRD. De Gruber 
asked other candidates to decline their candidacies in her 
favor. Regarding electoral violence, de Gruber has said she 
hopes violence could be averted. (Panama City Telemetro 
Television Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 21 March 94) 
  The Solidarity Party will not heed other parties' call to 
form a civic alliance, Solidarity Party presidential candidate 
Samuel Lewis Galindo has warned. Members of the National 
Consensus Alliance, comprised by the Solidarity and National 
Unity Mission, have visited the Central Avenue area. Lewis 
Galindo said he does not favor a civic alliance. Galindo said: 
"The people are beginning to realize that in the fights between 
the candidates, we are the only ones who can attain the 
requisite national unity to fight poverty." (Panama City 
Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 23 March 94) 
  Carlos Anel Cordero, Political Capsule columnist, reports 
Eduardo Vallarino, presidential candidate for the Christian 
Democratic Party, PDC, has addressed the National Federation of 
Business and Professional Women where he said the PDC government 
will insist on a more active role by women in administrative 
functions. Cordero adds all presidential candidates, except for 
the PA's Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, recently attended a meeting 
with the civic clubs during which they committed themselves to 
promote, respect, and strengthen civic values and morals. 
(Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 19 March 94 p 3A) 
  A 500-word article by Marco Julio de Obaldia states the PRD 
has one-third of the people's vote, "and this will be evident on 
8 May." De Obaldia writes "these votes were cultivated 
throughout 21 years," and most of the voters feel "they cannot 
go wrong by voting for the PRD." In conclusion, the writer urges 
the people to forget voting for the party of their choice, 
rather, to vote for the civic candidate who has "the greatest 
chance of winning," the only way to defeat the PRD candidate.

  [Text] Former President Jaime Paz Zamora has announced his 
definitive withdrawal from political life and his party 
leadership. Paz Zamora was distressed by the numerous 
accusations that he permitted the creation of a drug trafficking 
network within his administration and that many of the leaders 
of his party participated in it. Jaime Paz Zamora sent the media 
a recorded message in which he said he did not commit any 
crimes, he only made mistakes in good faith. 
  [Begin recording] [Paz Zamora] My dear fellow countrymen, 
from the day of my last speech during the inauguration on 6 
August of 1993... 
  [Unidentified reporter, interrupting] Paz's face was 
slimmer. 
The dramatic moment showed on the former president. He is 
obviously affected by the drama afflicting his party and many 
important MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] leaders. 
Jaime Paz Zamora faced the camera sure that millions of citizens 
would hear his definitive decision to withdraw from political 
life. He was overwhelmed by the accusations made by the Special 
Antinarcotics Force [FELCN] that he permitted the alleged 
coverup of drug trafficking activities during his government and 
that some of the leaders of his party had direct participation 
in it. 
  He was firm at the beginning of his message and had a 
hopeless look at the end. The former president used his farewell 
speech to try to instill hope in citizens who today have major 
doubts about his performance as head of state. 
  [Paz Zamora] I want to give my version of the latest reports 
linking us with drug trafficking that have shocked the country. 
The first thing I want to say on this matter, with all clarity 
and firmness, is that we never committed any crime. But just as 
clearly I must recognize, dear fellow countrymen, that there 
were mistakes, lack of prudence, or incorrect appreciation of 
situations and behavior. I also must admit to maintaining 
relations with some people in a good faith that was close to 
naivete. 
  [Reporter] Jaime Paz Zamora later said that it seems there 
are too many ill-intentioned attitudes. It seems that it is not 
important to seek the truth but to inflict political damage, he 
added. I cannot permit, he said, that by tarnishing my dignity 
as a former president that the issue will continue tarnishing my 
country's dignity. 
  [Paz Zamora] Dear fellow countrymen, listen to me well. With 
the same love and respect I always had for you, with calm and 
firmness, I want to announce that I have made the undeclinable 
decision to withdraw from the party leadership and national 
political activities. You have known me for many years. I have 
always acted in good faith, with good will, in all matters and 
with all people. I have acted under the guidance of moral 
principles that I learned from my family and the Bolivian 
people. Achievements have a prize; mistakes produce consequences 
that must be admitted with honor and dignity. 
  [Reporter] This is what Jaime Paz Zamora said on 26 March. 
He 
did not want to answer questions. This is why he sent the 
recorded message to the most important radio and television 
stations and newspapers. The man who founded MIR on 7 September 
1971, who for many years was an active and charismatic leader, 
who was almost killed during an attack because he was an alleged 
nuisance to the 1980 dictatorship, the man who on 6 August 1989 
was sworn in as president of the Republic, was thus withdrawing 
from political life. He assured and admitted to the people that 
he had made mistakes but did not commit any crime. [end

  [Excerpt] Sucre -- The decision of former President Jaime 
Paz Zamora to withdraw from political activities has caused 
surprise in the city. Paz Zamora admitted making mistakes but 
not commiting crimes during his government. 
  The news hit Movement of the Revolutionary Left [MIR] 
followers the hardest. They took the news in silence. The 
possibility of a meeting of party leaders to analyze the issue 
here has not been ruled out. The population, meanwhile, 
compares Jaime Paz Zamora with a captain who abandoned ship 
without clarifying the accusations against his party. 
  Chuquisaca Peasant Leader Octavio Flores said he was 
surprised because politicians involved in trafficking are not 
tried based on Law 1008. Bolivian jails contain many peasants 
who were involved in drug production out of need and now are 
serving sentences of up to 15 years. On the other hand, the 
trafficking kingpins have laws of repentance or are able to hide 
behind political activities. [passage omitted]

  [Text] La Paz, 28 Mar (EFE) -- Former Bolivian President 
Jaime Paz Zamora's "irrevocable" resignation from political life 
over his and his party's alleged involvement in trafficking has 
surprised Bolivian political circles. 
  Senate President Juan Carlos Duran, the top leader of the 
ruling Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR), said Paz 
Zamora's decision to withdraw from political life is personal. 
  Duran said the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) must 
now weigh the situation and define its political future. 
  Miguel Urioste, acting president of the social democratic 
Free Bolivia Movement (MBL) -- which is allied to the MNR -- 
said the time is not right "to prey on a fallen man" because 
this would hurt the image of Bolivian democracy, adding that 
"history will judge what has happened." 
  Deputy Ricardo Paz Ballivian, of the opposition Conscience 
of 
the Fatherland (Condepa), regretted Paz Zamora's decision, 
adding that the former president was "deeply affected" by 
accusations against him and his family. 
  "A party is an institution that cannot disappear because it 
is an alternative for the Bolivian people," said Paz Ballivan 
regarding the MIR -- the party he founded -- and its future. 
  Deputy Jerjes Justiniano, of the leftist Democratic 
Socialism 
Alternative (ASD), said Paz Zamora is a "scapegoat" for things 
done by some MIR leaders, adding that "institutions are not bad, 
only the men leading them are bad." 
  Jorge Landivar Roca, head of the Nationalist Democratic 
Action (ADN) -- a former MIR ally and member of the ruling 
coalition that governed the country between 1989 and 1993 -- 
said Paz Zamora's recognition of mistakes during his presidency 
was an act of "courage." 
  Current MIR President Oscar Eid -- who is also involved in 
the trafficking report -- said his party will not discuss its 
immediate future until the investigations on the alleged 
"narco-links" are concluded. 
  Eid said that when undisputable MIR leader Paz Zamora 
resigned, the party lost its main "orientation." Eid added: 
"Our former leader recognized his mistakes with dignity and 
courage. Just as achievements receive praise, errors have a 
cost." 
  MIR bloc leader Carlos Borth said party followers are 
disoriented and paralyzed by their leader's resignation and the 
accusations against various MIR leaders. 
  Borth said he will ask for an emergency meeting to analyze 
Eid's possible separation and to form a new executive board. 
  During the week MIR leaders testified before the Justice and 
Judicial Police Committee of the Bolivian Congress, the body 
responsible for investigating the alleged "narco-links." 
  Paz Zamora is considered to have the most important 
international career of the past years. He issued a dramatic 
message on 26 March ending his political career under the burden 
of accusations linking him with drug trafficking.

  [Text] Government and coca growers representatives have 
signed an agreement to end the tense situation in the Chapare 
tropical region. The five-article document ratifies the two 
parties' desire to fight trafficking and to prevent the 
eradication of plantations. It confirms that the government will 
continue to look for and destroy laboratories but without 
destroying coca plantations. 
  Article 4 is the most controversial: It specifies that the 
government and coca-growers leaders will implement Articles 10, 
14 and 24 of Law 1008. The government is committed to implement 
alternative development programs. 
  It has also been agreed that mixed commissions will be 
created to deal with issues related to coca-leaf production. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Are you happy with 
the agreement? 
  [Unidentified coca growers leader] We believe there is an 
agreement, but we will only be happy when the terms of the 
agreement are complied with. [end recording] 
  The coca growers believe this agreement represents victory 
for them because the government has promised not to forcefully 
eradicate the sacred leaf. 
  [Begin unidentified coca growers leader recording] Forceful 
eradication without an alternative crop cannot flourish. [end 
recording] 
  The government believes the agreement will ensure peace and 
the implementation of alternative development in the 
coca-producing regions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Guillermo Sotomayor, general manager of the </F>
National Railway Enterprise; place and date not given: "ENFE 
Capitalization Now Proceeding Like Clockwork"] 
  [Text] In 10 months a U.S. consulting firm will advise how 
ENFE [National Railway Enterprise] can best transfer 50 percent 
of its assets to private ownership. Governments of the United 
States and Japan are the first to be showing interest in the old 
worn-out enterprise. 
  Although ENFE has the appearance of a worn-out little old 
lady, there is no lack of interested suitors for her hand. 
According to the guardians of the enterprise, the Governments of 
Japan and the United States have requested information that can 
be disseminated to investors in their countries who might be 
interested in buying 50 percent of the enterprise's assets 
within the near term. 
  "ENFE is an attractive enterprise if one considers that it 
is 
the linchpin of the interoceanic export corridor," says ENFE's 
general manager, Guillermo Sotomayor, contradicting the view 
expressed by Minister of Economic Development Fernando Illanes 
who asserts that those interested in buying into an obsolete 
enterprise and squanderer of revenue such as ENFE would be very 
few. 
  Nevertheless, with or without formal bids in hand, the 
enterprise's executives have begun putting the house in order. 
  A Canadian consulting firm has begun appraising the 
enterprise's assets. Its findings will then be made available to 
a U.S. consulting firm that, between September and October, will 
recommend the manner in which ENFE is to form a mixed 
corporation with national and foreign investors. 
  ENFE General Manager Guillermo Sotomayor explained to 
PRESENCIA the steps the enterprise will take before 
incorporating. 
  [PRESENCIA] What features will characterize the capitalizing 
of ENFE? 
  [Sotomayor] In Bolivia, we have two geographically separate 
networks: the Western or Andean Network, which covers a distance 
of 2,275 kilometers, and the Eastern Network, with 1,377 
kilometers of track. Both operate at very high cost because of 
the excessive number of personnel, obsolete rolling stock, and 
the high cost of maintaining the rails. 
  ENFE's most profitable activity at this time is the 
transporting of bulk freight. In addition, our capital base 
differs from those of other enterprises, including as it does 
workshops, rails, real estate, and other fixed assets. 
  This renders ENFE's capitalization different from that of 
other enterprises. 
  The first thing we are doing is working together with 
foreign 
consulting firms and their domestic counterpart on the compiling 
of studies that are necessary for the planning of our 
capitalization strategy. 
  In this respect we are being aided by Canadian consultants 
who will appraise our fixed assets, real estate, and assets 
surplus to our railway activities. 
  It has been 30 years since ENFE's assets were last 
appraised. 
In many countries, the railways have a very strong potential in 
real estate, such as, for example, railway stations. What we 
want to determine in Bolivia is just what our railway 
potentialities are. 
  Once our Canadian consultants complete their basic studies 
with respect to this question, a U.S. consulting firm will 
prepare the capitalization strategy. It will recommend the best 
option available to us as an enterprise, and as a country, for 
tendering ENFE. 
  They may recommend offering it as a single package that 
includes both networks, or possibly in two separate packages 
because the Andean network's prospects are poor. Or they may 
even recommend that the rails be tendered but not the 
maintenance and repair shops and facilities. There are many 
options for tendering railways. 
  [PRESENCIA] What is the possibility that private investors 
would only operate and manage the rails? 
  [Sotomayor] There are a few countries, like Colombia and 
Chile, where the government has decided to retain full ownership 
of the property and lease the use of the rails for a specified 
number of years. 
  In the case of Bolivia, we are seeking to increase the 
enterprise's capital in order to facilitate some 
very-large-scale projects, such as the famous railway 
interconnection or the renovation of rolling stock. These 
require heavy investments. 
  But we must await the completion of all their studies before 
we can determine the course the enterprise is to take. 
  [PRESENCIA] How long will it take the consultants to 
complete 
their work? 
  [Sotomayor] Between September and October we shall already 
have a very close and definitive idea as to how ENFE will be 
capitalized. 
  [PRESENCIA] Will fresh capital be injected into the 
enterprise while its capitalization is pending? 
  [Sotomayor] No, we are not planning any considerable 
investment. No new investments will be made until we have the 
results of the consultants' work. 
  [PRESENCIA] Doesn't the government assert that ENFE is not 
an 
attractive enterprise to investors? 
  [Sotomayor] It is true that the cost of maintaining the 
rails 
is high, and that its rolling stock is of an outdated type. But 
ENFE's potential lies in Bolivia's potential for providing the 
Interoceanic Corridor. 
  Bolivia has railways that connect it with Peru, Argentina, 
Brazil, and Chile. We believe this is the main attraction to 
investors. 
  [PRESENCIA] Is there an enterprise interested in buying into 
ENFE? 
  [Sotomayor] No specific enterprise has contacted us 
directly, 
but we understand that there have been direct contacts with the 
government. What is definite is that the Governments of the 
United States and Japan have requested direct information from 
ENFE. They are interested in taking information back and 
attracting capital to the country.

<F P=106> [[Interview with Fernando Illanes, minister of economic </F>
development, in La Paz; date not given: "Capitalization: A 
Complicated Economic and Social Equation"] 
  [Text] Minister of Economic Development Fernando Illanes is 
an outspoken man. As various governments and social sectors have 
found, he pulls no punches. 
  Despite some disagreements, the president of the Republic 
has 
entrusted him with this difficult ministry and the mission of 
maintaining the macroeconomic balances and implementing the 
capitalization of state-owned enterprises, the main plank of his 
government's platform. 
  Illanes has long lived in the spheres of power and is 
accustomed to exercising authority, a fact that sometimes 
subjects him to setbacks. He has twice been president of the 
CEPB [Bolivian Private Businessmen Confederation], ambassador to 
the United States, and minister of energy. 
  PRESENCIA interviewed him in his office, and the hour he had 
allotted to the interview extended to almost two hours, during 
which he spoke "his mind, (because) we are not in a political 
arena." Space, however, prevents us from publishing the 
interview in its entirety. 
  [PRESENCIA] During the electoral campaign, you were a harsh 
critic of capitalization. You even said that you knew nothing 
about it and that you were going to vote for Oscar Bonifaz. How 
did President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada manage to lure you? 
  [Illanes] I did not say I was going to vote for Bonifaz. You 
media people still turn my words around at your convenience. I 
said that Bonifaz was the only one who openly said that the 
economy should be privatized. 
  When the president invited me to be minister I had already 
spent some time working with him, because he first asked me to 
be part of an advisory team that, between June and August, 
cooperated with him on several matters, mainly the 
reorganization of the executive branch of the government and 
capitalization. At that point I stated to the president my 
objections especially to what I saw as not conducive to the 
attracting of investments, because, in the end, that is what it 
is all about. 
  Some of those objections have been incorporated, to a 
certain 
extent, in the capitalization project. The original plan has 
undergone some changes, and now I am convinced that it is viable 
and will attract foreign investments. There have been 
substantial changes: stockholding, management contracts, and 
stock operations. 
  I do not mean to say that I imposed those ideas. It was an 
enlightening dialogue with several experts and the president 
himself that convinced me that capitalization is a process that 
goes well beyond privatization. Capitalization has a very 
important social aspect, which is the inclusion of a universal 
pension plan that has no place in a privatization process. In 
the privatization case, one sells an enterprise, receives money, 
spends it one way or another, and there the process ends. It is 
a one-shot investment spanning one, two, or three years, and 
then there is nothing. 
  [PRESENCIA] Why has the possibility opened that the TGN 
[National Treasury] will acquire creditors' rights, by 
subrogation, against the enterprises that are to be capitalized? 
  [Illanes] One little word in the bill to be enacted needs to 
be underlined: It says that the Treasury "may" acquire such 
rights as subrogee, not that it "must" do so; and therein lies a 
subtle but big difference. "May" means yes or no. Everyone is 
assuming "yes"; I, on the contrary, assume "no." Between these 
two positions, there are many possibilities that will depend on 
the situation of each of the enterprises. 
  Besides, one must analyze the reason why that article was 
incorporated. The object is to maximize the amount of the 
investment so as to create more jobs, more capital, more 
economic activity, more growth of the GNP (gross national 
product), and hence more funds that can be devoted to health, 
education, and basic housing. 
  The more the liabilities the TGN can absorb, the more the 
book value of the enterprises' assets increases. Besides, there 
are assets that cannot be included in book value, such as 
reserves, contracts, trademarks, market, etc., but that are 
quantifiable in the acquisition of an enterprise; and these will 
be quantified in the capitalization process. 
  There are two sides to the coin. If the TGN absorbs these 
liabilities, it will be affected, but only relatively because 
the credits are very soft; they are renegotiable; they will go 
to the Paris Club; etc. That is to say, there are many 
mechanisms that can lighten the load. And as I have said, if 
economic activity picks up, the Treasury will collect more 
revenue. 
  There are also problems with leaving these liabilities on 
the 
books of the enterprises. First, foreign loans are always 
guaranteed by the state, and to the international lending 
institutions it makes very little difference whether the loan is 
to the enterprise or to the TGN, as long as the ultimate debtor 
is the state. 
  Second, it places the enterprises in a disadvantageous or 
unfair competitive position with respect to others that may seek 
to enter the same field. A YPFB [Bolivian Government Oil 
Deposits] with very soft credits will be much better able to 
compete than an enterprise that has to resort to bank loans. 
  The pros and cons must be balanced against each other, and 
it 
is for this reason that the article stipulates "may." We are 
going to consider case by case, in accordance with the degree 
and type of debt of the enterprise, the desire or needs of the 
provider of capital, etc. 
  [PRESENCIA] Why was it decided to release 50 percent of the 
enterprises' stocks to investors, when initially it was to be 49 
percent? 
  [Illanes] In order to render their capitalization viable. 
Indeed this was precisely one of my major doubts concerning the 
Plan of Everyone. A private investor holding 50 percent of an 
enterprise's capital stock and a management contract that can 
only be revoked by 51 percent can sleep peacefully and manage 
and operate the enterprise. 
  [PRESENCIA] Assume, for example, that within some 15 years 
the capitalized enterprise needs more money. Will it be injected 
by the provider of capital? If so, will parity of capital shares 
not be broken? 
  [Illanes] We must paint things in their true colors; we are 
not in a political arena. The stocks belong to the Bolivians, 
but they are deposited in a trust fund managed by the pension 
fund management firms, which in turn are obliged to open savings 
accounts for each and every citizen. 
  We believe there will be between five and 10 firms of this 
type. Assuming there are 10, each one will receive more than 
300,000 shares, will open more than 300,000 accounts, and will 
be obliged to meet physically with its savers once a year to 
show them what they have in their account, issue them their 
individual passbooks, and certify the amounts entered therein. 
For example, if the value of the stock is $1,000--everyone 
refers to that figure, but the actual figure is not yet 
known--each citizen will receive his or her passbook, in which 
that figure has been entered. The following year, through 
capitalization, dividends, stock market transactions, etc., he 
or she will have, say, $1,200, and will be visited and informed 
of it in person. When the account is opened, the citizen will no 
longer be the owner of that stock, but rather of its value. And 
even if, on the following day, all of the shares are sold, the 
citizen will have benefited from 100 percent of the value of the 
state-owned enterprises as of the date of the transfer. 
  The shares need to be traded in order to maximize the yield 
of the savings. In other words, if tomorrow, ENTEL [National 
Telecommunications Enterprise] begins to be a financially 
troubled enterprise, the citizen is safeguarded, because the 
pension fund manager will sell that stock and buy stock, say, in 
YPFB, or the Brewery, or General Motors, or what have you. 
  Within certain limits, the fund manager could even transfer 
the managed stocks outside of Bolivia, as all 
individual-capitalization pension funds do, because the object 
is to maximize the yield. 
  The same will occur when there is a capital increase. Let us 
suppose that, five years from now, ENFE [National Railway 
Enterprise] needs an influx of new capital. The decision will 
have to be made by the fund management firms in the name of the 
Bolivians, because it cannot possibly be made by 3.2 million 
Bolivians. That is one of the reasons why we have chosen this 
road. A physical distribution of the shares is an insoluble 
problem, a lunacy, because there are physical problems, problems 
of speculation, of abuse, and in sum, many things that have 
dissuaded us from that approach, which was the one I initially 
favored. But it cannot be done that way, and we have opted for 
the approach wherein the stockholders have representatives 
managing their money, whose objective is the same as that of the 
stockholders: maximizing the return on those savings. 
  These representatives will attend stockholder meetings. 
Certainly some, representing all, will be members of the boards. 
It is they who will approve budgets, etc. The day that an 
enterprises goes into the red, they will leave it and move funds 
to another, because the enterprises will not be operating 
jointly, but individually. 
  [PRESENCIA] Does this not contradict the example the 
president cites when he recounts how the idea of capitalization 
occurred to him? It is that of the small farmer who seeks a 
partner to invest in his land, and does not need to sell it. 
According to your explanation, the enterprises will no longer 
belong to the Bolivians. 
  [Illanes] There will be a restriction as to those to whom 
stocks may be sold. It is hardly likely that there will even be 
a domestic market for those stocks for some time to come. We are 
going to have to create it with the funds that these pension 
managers put into those enterprises. 
  It is like a bank: Its capital is the contribution made by 
its stockholders, and the money of the savings accounts is in 
trust under the bank's management. Pension funds operate in a 
similar manner, except that the savings are long-term deposits. 
In this case, the future direct or indirect profits of those 
firms belong to the Bolivians. 
  [PRESENCIA] What happens if one of them goes bankrupt? 
  [Illanes] How can it go bankrupt? In the first place, we are 
demanding that the fund management firms be of international 
class, highly experienced, and well capitalized, so that what 
they invest here will be 1 percent of their assets. Thus, we 
will have the backing of a parent company. 
  Secondly, there will be regulations and a superintendency of 
pension funds--like that of banks--that will audit them 
continuously. 
  In all of these financial entities, there are mechanisms for 
avoiding disasters. For example, since the Superintendency of 
Banks has been in operation, the banks have been doing just 
fine. Before, it was a travesty. There is only one way that the 
management firms could go bankrupt, and that is, for the six 
state-owned enterprises to do so. But that would mean that the 
country has gone to hell, that Bolivia has gone bankrupt. 
  [PRESENCIA] If the stockholder dies, is the saving passed on 
to the stockholder's heirs? 
  [Illanes] Of course. There will certainly be the alternative 
of either receiving a lump-sum settlement or an additional 
number of years of pension, because, by actuarial calculations, 
the value of the fund will grow. 
  We are creating a new system of social security and, above 
all, an attitude toward saving that currently does not exist in 
Bolivia. Our level of saving is probably one of the world's 
lowest, and being a poor nation is not an excuse. Twenty or 25 
years ago, countries as poor or poorer than we, like the Asiatic 
ones, had a level of saving equal to 35 percent of GDP [gross 
domestic product]--and they are maintaining it--because of the 
high value they place on the mentality of living frugally and 
saving for the future. I believe that we save 7 to 8 percent of 
our GDP. 
  With this new mentality, we will begin to save voluntarily 
upon seeing that our parents have an adequate retirement 
pension. Thus, first we are going to raise the level of saving. 
We are going to create a social security that I believe is of 
utmost importance, perhaps the single most important thing. 
  Second, Bolivia's big problem is that over the past six 
years 
its economy has grown at an average rate of 3.7 percent 
annually, and that is not sufficient to recover what we have 
lost. During the period of hyperinflation around the beginning 
of the 1980's, we lost 30 percent of our per capita production, 
and at our current rate of growth it will take us 35 years to 
reach where we were in 1980. We, therefore, have to break the 
vicious circle by means of investment, and the only way to do it 
is through capitalization. An investment of $3 billion cannot 
other than generate massive direct or indirect employment and 
further incremental investment. And our GDP will thus rise. I 
believe that by 1997, with that $3 billion, we should be growing 
at the rate of 8 percent annually. The economists express alarm: 
There will be an "overheating" of the economy, they say. Well, 
what do you know! I can only wish that were the problem on my 
hands, rather than the current depression and this snail-paced 
growth. 
  [PRESENCIA] What is the reason for first forming a mixed 
state-and-private-owned corporation? 
  [Illanes] It is a legal mechanism for transforming the 
enterprise into a corporation later. Otherwise, we would have to 
call for bids, obtain a proposal, then go to Congress and 
request approval. The reason is a practical one. 
  Besides, there is the desire that the workers become 
stockholders in the enterprises that are to be capitalized. They 
will be able to do this through their social benefits. 
  [PRESENCIA] What is going to be sold to investors? 
  [Illanes] Under this plan, the state never sells anything. 
That is the big point. Let us say that a state-owned enterprise 
has a present-day worth of 1,000. With its transformation into a 
mixed corporation, the entry of workers adds 10, bring its worth 
to a total of 1,010. Then comes the third stage, that of its 
incorporation, in which the investor puts up 1,010, at which 
point the enterprise is worth 2,020. The original 1,000 goes to 
the people; that is, we have sacrificed nothing, we have sold 
nothing, assuming that the provider of capital is going to put 
up the enterprise's book value. Actually, however, the provider 
of capital will be investing more. The YPFB's books, for 
example, do not include as entries the contract with Brazil or 
the hydrocarbon reserves because the deposits do not belong to 
YPFB, but they can include the financial value of the expected 
exploitation of those deposits. 
  [PRESENCIA] Who is going to set the value? 
  [Illanes] The market. 
  [PRESENCIA] Another question to which the proposed bill has 
given rise is: If the enterprise's objective is profit, how will 
the state address works of a social nature, such as rural 
electrification, for example? 
  [Illanes] Two things can be done. First, adjust rates and 
bring operations into the black. Second, subsidize through the 
electrification enterprises, which is much easier, because there 
will be competition and many power distribution companies (we 
are not talking here of power generation). 
  For example, there is an isolated system that is having 
terrible problems--the SETAR [Tarija Electric Service]--first 
because it does not collect past-due amounts owed to it and 
hence does not pay its debts, and second, it charges ridiculous 
rates because it is a very small system. A private corporation 
will certainly invest money and will interconnect with the rest 
of the system in order to lower its operating costs. I believe 
that is a viable approach to the solution. In the case of very 
small enterprises, capitalization is not applicable, because it 
is a very complex process. Therefore, they will be auctioned, 
sold, or transferred to the private or cooperatives sector. 
  [PRESENCIA] Capitalization is a thesis. What is its 
antithesis? 
  [Illanes] Continuing in our present situation, or worse. I 
see no other solution. 
  The big problem is that the basic thesis is not ours alone; 
it is worldwide. We have given it a social, plural content. 
  We believe that capitalization will produce a permanent and 
growing effect. And since this is the international turn of 
mind, the international institutions and all the countries that 
offer us aid, loans, or grants reflect that mentality. Today, 
the World Bank does not want to lend money to drill wells, or 
build hydroelectric plants or railroads, but rather for health, 
education, and basic welfare. 
  If state-owned enterprises want to survive they must resort 
to banks for loans. And if they have been unable to survive to 
date with low- or no-cost loans, how can they do so on 
commercial loans, while remaining in the hands of the state, 
with its inefficiency, its political meddling? 
  Not that the state is a poor manager. The problem is that 
the 
managers appointed by the state, good or bad though they be, 
have to cope with political meddling. Every four years, there 
are changes of personnel, including the managers. This produces 
total instability in the careers of the workers and 
professionals, and hinders the making of plans, the programming 
of investment, etc. 
  What we are now trying to do is isolate the enterprises from 
political influence, by transferring them to private-sector 
management. If we do not capitalize, those enterprises will die, 
and that would be unquestionably a disaster for Bolivia, because 
the country would lose revenue and jobs. As things stand now, 
the state-owned enterprises cannot survive. 
<H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5>
<H5>  Strategic Sectors?... Rubbish! </H5>
  After the explanation given by Minister of Economic 
Development Fernando Illanes on the necessity of attracting 
capital, we asked if the influx of that capital might not bring 
with it the danger of creating a state within a state. 
  He emphatically rejected that possibility. "We are not going 
back to Patino's time. Let me give you an example. In 1952, when 
the mines were nationalized, Mr. Simon Patino personally was 
worth $4.2 billion (whose relative value today would be 10 times 
more than that). There is probably not a single enterprise in 
Bolivia that is worth even half that figure. In other words 
Simon Patino would be worth some $40 or $42 billion in current 
dollars. We are talking about a gentleman who was worth $4.2 
billion in a country whose budget at the time, by all reckoning, 
was surely not even $1 billion, and whose GDP was not even $1 
billion." 
  Furthermore, he explained, there will be regulations. 
"Insofar as possible, the market will be wide open. The market 
for YPFB, which is the largest of the enterprises, will be the 
widest open, because in its case it is indeed possible. There 
are others that, as the economists are saying, are natural 
monopolies, and one of the few among them is ENFE [National 
Railways Enterprise]. 
  "As for the rest, I believe it will certainly be possible to 
open them up to, if not total market transparency, then at 
least, in the worst of cases, to one or more oligopolies that 
will be strictly regulated and supervised by a regulatory body 
having oversight over the energy, hydrocarbons, rail, and 
airlines sectors, etc." 
  The minister believes that, for these reasons, "no single 
enterprise will be able to wield economic power of such huge 
dimensions," and much less so if it is in the hands of not just 
a few people, but of "hundreds of thousands or millions of 
stockholders," so that decisions are arrived at through a 
meeting of the stockholders and boards of directors. 
  He therefore asserts: "There will no longer be kings of tin. 
I cannot imagine that happening. The conditions no longer exist 
that might create such a distortion in our economy, which is now 
very much more diversified. Before, we produced tin, period." 
  In another vein, we asked the minister whether it might be 
possible for strategic sectors to be manipulated by 
international capital. Illanes categorically rejected the idea. 
"That line of thought marks a generational abyss. I do not 
believe in the word `strategic.' I very much hope that a 
transnational will come forth, and not some small-time company, 
because our market is so insignificant that we are doing 
handsprings specifically to attract big-time transnational 
capital. It is our only hope of guaranteeing that these grounded 
enterprises will be refloated, because they require colossal 
investments and international markets. 
  "To my mind, only the human being is strategic. The rest is 
rubbish. Pardon my frankness, but I do not believe in strategic 
sectors." 
<H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5>
<H5>  Everyone Will End Up With Less </H5>
  There being no other way to broach the subject, Fernando 
Illanes was asked directly about his forthcoming negotiations 
with the COB [Bolivian Labor Federation] and the universities, 
and the degrees of flexibility he can bring to bear. 
  Without hesitation, he termed it "a question without a 
response, because if I had degrees of flexibility I could not 
reveal them since I would then be exposing my negotiating cards. 
And if I said none, I would be lying." 
  He stated that the meetings held with the universities thus 
far had been productive and cordial, and that he had offered 
them, "within my concept that the human being is the country's 
most important asset, personally to make every possible effort 
to satisfy their needs. I know that I shall not be able to 
satisfy them to the extent of 100 percent, I told them, but I 
can at least improve the present situation of the universities." 
  "But," he added, "everyone wants more, including myself for 
my ministry. And I have not succeeded in obtaining it, because I 
have a secretary for finance and an undersecretary for the 
budget who are more hard-nosed than I." 
  He said there should be no distinction between the technical 
and the political as regards relationships with the different 
sectors. We need to do the right thing, he said, "and not resort 
to distortion or to causing unrest somewhere just to win votes. 
That sort of thing, it seems, is what is called politics," he 
stated with irony. Nevertheless, he asserted that the government 
will necessarily "cause unrest throughout the nation, as well as 
in all the ministries, because no one is receiving what it set 
out to receive. No one, absolutely no one." And, he said, this 
state of things will continue "until capital begins to flow into 
Bolivia. If that flow does not occur, our future will be one of 
very slow growth, which is not a solution for the people of 
Bolivia. And a solution that does not resolve the problem of the 
majority of the Bolivians is not a solution. Another one has to 
be found."

<F P=106> [Interview with Secretary of the Treasury Fernando Cossio in </F>
La Paz; date not given] 
  [Text] At the moment, Fernando Cossio--a geologist and an 
economist who has never worked in the private sector--is one of 
the most sought after persons in the government. Together with 
the president of the Central Bank of Bolivia, his namesake 
Fernando Candia, the secretary of the treasury has the mission, 
assigned by the president of the Republic, to maintain economic 
stability. 
  With this objective, he is now about to give the finishing 
touches to the 1994 general budget, which will soon be submitted 
to Congress. 
  It is no easy task because "it means having great fiscal 
discipline. This role, naturally, is not very pleasant; everyone 
has pretensions to more funds and wants to do things, but there 
are essential limitations and it is not possible," he explains. 
  Nevertheless, he is optimistic about the country's future, 
while not ignoring the difficulties, and he is prepared to 
receive an evaluation mission from the International Monetary 
Fund on Wednesday, 16 March, which will in his judgment make 
possible a disbursement of $20 million--suspended because of a 
deficit incurred by the previous government--and will begin to 
negotiate for new assistance over a period of three years. 
  After two postponements and amid constant interruptions 
(until he turned off the cellular telephone), Cossio received 
PRESENCIA in his office. 
  [PRESENCIA] How will the balance in the national budget 
between social investment and economic investment work in 
practice? 
  [Cossio] The tendency over the medium and long terms is to 
give greater emphasis to social investment. However, this will 
no longer be possible beginning in 1994 because most foreign 
financing already agreed upon or in the process of being 
approved still complies with traditional criteria of public 
investment. 
  On the other hand, it is rather difficult to develop new 
plans in three months. These procedures are much longer and 
normally take more than 18 months. This discrimination in favor 
of the social sector will become much more evident beginning 
next year. 
  In spite of this, the 1994 budget already assigns an 
appreciable amount of funds to the social sector; but, this has 
begun to grow with the passage of time as new projects to be 
financed in the social sector take shape and--something very 
important--the structural reforms take shape. Which means that 
they "go together." 
  Let me explain: so that investment in education, for 
example, 
be much more efficient and not be wasted--as happens now--there 
must be a change in the structural functioning of the sector. It 
cannot be otherwise. The administration of these funds must be 
handled much more efficiently than it has been so far. 
  It is no accident that among the important conditions of the 
World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to 
grant loans, one, for example, is that educational reform be 
under way. 
  [PRESENCIA] And for the health sector? 
  [Cossio] The same for the health sector. 
  Now, naturally we must enact the reforms with or without the 
World Bank. Because, what happens if we do not? We build 
schools, health facilities that no one takes care of, that fall 
apart by themselves, there is no maintenance and, five years 
later, you have to start spending again to recapture the 
investment, and so on in a vicious circle, because there is no 
maintenance or care, the desks are stolen, the windows in many 
educational institutions.... 
  Then, the community must look after these assets, and that 
is 
how education reform is going. The education councils or the 
scholastic communities (or whatever they are called), that will 
be made up of parents, teachers, and representatives of 
municipalities, will be the ones who look after the schools. 
  At the moment, there is no supervision of any kind. If the 
teacher goes to school, fine. If he does not go, nothing 
happens. There is no supervision over the use of these resources. 
  [PRESENCIA] Will resources be transferred directly to the 
community or will the state continue to manage them, under its 
own control and authority? 
  [Cossio] As this is not my area and I have not dealt with 
it, 
I do not have exact answers, but I have the impression that the 
unit of Bolivian society that is going to be strengthened with 
the participation of the people will be the municipality, which 
will receive the resources. 
  [PRESENCIA] You have said that the general budgetary cap is 
9.5 billion bolivares. Where will the revenue come from if 
domestic income and customs only produce 2.8 billion bolivares? 
  [Cossio] The financing is roughly as follows: 
  About 53 percent of the Treasury's revenues come from income 
and customs; about 42 percent from transfers from hydrocarbons, 
and the remainder from various items: services provided, 
surpluses, and something (minimal) from mining royalties. 
  Basically, it is domestic revenue, customs' revenue, 
transfers from hydrocarbons, and foreign financing for 
investment, which is a large share. 
  [PRESENCIA] This is about 9.5 billion bolivares? 
  [Cossio] No, this is the amount in the nonfinancial public 
sector. The Treasury budget is only 4.2 billion bolivares, more 
or less. 
  The nonfinancial public sector, the consolidated sector, is 
9.5 billion bolivares. Excluded are the public financial sector, 
which is the Central Bank, and certain funds, such as the 
National Fund for Regional Development, that are institutions of 
a financial nature that we do not take into account. What we do 
take into account are the nonfinancial public sector, that is, 
the Treasury, the central government, decentralized state-owned 
companies, and development corporations. 
  [PRESENCIA] To clarify, the Treasury has 4.2 billion 
bolivares.... 
  [Cossio] Yes, 4.2 billion. 
  [PRESENCIA] This comes from customs, income, transfers from 
hydrocarbons, and various services. And the difference of 5.3 
billion bolivares? 
  [Cossio] This is from resources of their own that the 
companies generate and much of the foreign financing, which goes 
to the companies. 
  [PRESENCIA] How will the 7.5 percent increase in global 
wages, proposed by the government, be translated into real wages? 
  [Cossio] First, why 7.5 percent? Because our forecast for 
inflation in 1994 is 7.5 percent and our policy is to at least 
maintain real wages. We are aware that we cannot improve them 
from one day to the next, but we will maintain real wages. 
  [PRESENCIA] Could the 7.5 percent increase in global wages 
vary in real wages as a function of differentiated curves or to 
benefit some sectors more than others, as in previous years? 
  [Cossio] The 7.5 percent is applied to the global wage of 
each group. Now, as long as it does not exceed 7.5 percent, some 
might receive 10 percent and others 5 percent, to reach the 
average of 7.5 percent. 
  [PRESENCIA] Will each institution decide this distribution 
independently or will your ministry be in charge of doing it? 
  [Cossio] I believe that each ministry will negotiate with 
its 
sector, and each company will take its real possibilities into 
account. 
  [PRESENCIA] One of the proposals for education reform is to 
increase teachers salaries substantially. Does what you say mean 
that this increase will be possible only through the application 
of the 7.5 percent? 
  [Cossio] No. There is something more in the teachers' 
situation that may also arise in other situations. We have a 
study on teacher staffing which shows us that, in the city of La 
Paz, there is a difference of 2,800 positions that are paid but 
not occupied. These are what are called ghost teachers. We have 
the impression that in the three principal cities of the central 
axis there are 5,000 to 6,000 positions that exist in the budget 
but are not filled; this is the difference between the positions 
in the staffing pattern and the people who are actually there. 
As we identify these ghost positions, which are important, the 
resulting savings can go to improve the salaries of teachers who 
really exist. 
  [PRESENCIA] Will the 7.5 percent by which the global salary 
will be increased be calculated on the present staffing, 
including the ghosts? 
  [Cossio] Yes, but we are naturally going to clean this up 
when the reenrollment of all government employees is completed. 
  There are ghosts not only in teacher staffing, but in other 
institutions as well, even among the well-deserving of the 
fatherland. There are many persons who have died but who 
continue to receive payment. The number of widows does not 
diminish but rather increases. 
  [PRESENCIA] How many teachers are there paid by the state? 
  [Cossio] There are 107,000 positions. 
  [PRESENCIA] With regard to the 7.5 percent increase in the 
budget for universities, you said that this decision was 
"unchangeable but could be revised." What does that mean? 
  [Cossio] It means that the 7.5 percent cannot be revised, 
but 
if there is a real willingness to negotiate, expenses could be 
rationalized in other sectors of the universities' budgets. 
  Everyone knows, for example, that administrative personnel 
staffing is very large in relation to the number of professors 
and students. 
  Some universities have already begun to rationalize. For 
example, there has been an important reduction in administrative 
personnel in the Technical University of Orura and the Greater 
University of San Simon. 
  [PRESENCIA] Will the premium for efficiency for universities 
be continued? 
  [Cossio] Only for 1993, which we are going to pay now, in 
1994. These are one time only payments. 
  [PRESENCIA] If the budget prepared by the government is 
followed, will it not be necessary to increase the price of 
hydrocarbons? 
  [Cossio] No, because the budget is going to be unbalanced, 
with a deficit of 800 million bolivares, which is three percent 
of the gross domestic product (GDP) and must be financed. 
  [PRESENCIA] According to what you say, the budget is very 
austere and the government has forecast growth of 4.5 percent. 
Is there not a risk of entering a vicious circle of low spending 
but also of low growth? And what remains of the promise of 8 
percent annual growth by the end of this administration? 
  [Cossio] Let us not forget that 1994 is the first real year 
of this government. We estimated 4.5 percent taking into 
consideration above all foreign financing, which is assured. 
  We think that progress in the capitalization process and 
greater, more decided and bolder participation by the private 
sector in investment must cause the economy to grow by 7 to 8 
percent in one or two years. 
  Last year, total investment in Bolivia was about 14 percent 
of GDP; the public sector invested about 7 percent and the 
private sector a similar amount. I am speaking in very global 
terms, but those are the orders of magnitude. 
  If we had an investment structure similar to Chile, for 
example--about 25 percent of GDP--the state would have to be 
investing about 9-10 percent and the private sector about 15 
percent. Only those levels of investment can assure growth of 8 
percent. 
  In sum, the private sector (the foreign portion, through 
capitalization, as well as the domestic portion, through its own 
investments, in a market economy that is working) has to assure 
these higher investment levels. 
  [PRESENCIA] How much public investment is there; and what 
portion of it comes from foreign credits or grants and how much 
from the Treasury? 
  [Cossio] This is a somewhat dynamic situation. Until the 
budget has been presented to Congress and promulgated by the 
executive, the numbers will be changing constantly. We are still 
adjusting them, but let us say that the level should be around 
$500 million. I believe that will be the figure, more or less, 
from $500 to $510 million. 
  Investment from foreign resources is about $350 million in 
credits and grants. The rest is from the Treasury, and in 
addition what corporations invest with copartnerships, 
royalties, etc. 
  [PRESENCIA] A large share of the Treasury's income comes 
from 
transfers from state-owned companies. When these companies are 
capitalized, will the taxes they pay equal the amount of the 
transfers? 
  [Cossio] They must, they have to. 
  [PRESENCIA] Do the projections show this? 
  [Cossio] We are conducting exercises with mathematical 
simulations and with models to calculate exactly the levels of 
revenue that the new system should produce, so that the Treasury 
will not lose out during a period of transition. 
  [PRESENCIA] The announcements about the composition of the 
budget and the structural measures the government intends to 
initiate are already causing social conflict. Although your 
office is essentially technical, what political factors are 
there to weaken or to negotiate with the various sectors? 
  [Cossio] There is a large margin for negotiation, and to 
explain that not only the government is going to benefit by 
these changes but the entire country. That is the essential 
element of a transformation. 
  Transformations do not occur in a calm environment. There 
are 
going to be conflicts because a transformation brings with it a 
change in things, and people normally do not like change. I 
believe that, while not entering areas that are not my 
responsibility, there is a broad margin for negotiation and for 
becoming convinced of the need for these reforms. 
  [PRESENCIA] Do you believe in force? 
  [Cossio] In the force of ideas, yes. 
  [PRESENCIA] In the context of what you have said, would you 
hazard a forecast of what the government is going to do in the 
next four years? 
  [Cossio] It would be very pretentious of me to do that, in 
general, but I believe that if we are successful in the 
capitalization process, if we carry out the law on popular 
participation--which is really going to change the country's 
roots in the allocation of resources--and if there is greater 
and massive private investment, the conditions will exist to see 
a new Bolivia in four or six years. These are long processes and 
no one can say that the country will be totally changed by 1997, 
but if we leave the seed well planted in fertile soil, I 
believe.... I am very optimistic. 
<H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5>
<H5>  My Beloved Buenos Aires </H5>
  [PRESENCIA] What is the situation with Argentina at the 
moment? 
  [Cossio] I can cite only two facts, because the subject is 
outside my area. First, only $20 million remains of the special 
payment made by Argentina last year, which will be paid in 
January and February. Unfortunately, this special payment of 
$110 million is finished. Second, new sales contracts--because 
there might be more than one--are being negotiated. 
  [PRESENCIA] Has provision been made for these contracts in 
the 1994 budget? 
  [Cossio] We have made provision in the budget for a volume 
similar to that of 1993, estimating the sales price at 10 
percent more than the previous year, at $1.10. It is a very 
conservative estimate but also very realistic. 
  [PRESENCIA] But does this not open a serious gap for the 
government? 
  [Cossio] The gap we have is caused by the end of the special 
payment, because there will no longer be any taxes to be 
collected on it. 
  [PRESENCIA] How has this gap been filled? 
  [Cossio] With very significant cuts in operating expenses. 
First, we reduced all budgets for overtime pay by half; travel 
by half; travel expenses by 33 percent. These are the cuts, the 
savings we have been talking about, and it is a lot of money. 
  Second, we have sufficient data to be almost certain that 
income tax collections will improve by 17 percent, which means 
additional revenue of some 240 million bolivares. 
  These measures make it possible for us to cover the gap 
caused by the decline in revenues due to the cessation of the 
special payment from Argentina, and also part of the salary 
increase. 
<H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5>
<H5>  The Dreary Legacy </H5>
  [PRESENCIA] What was the legacy left by the previous 
government in the economic area? 
  [Cossio] The figures tell the story. The previous government 
had committed itself, in the plan agreed on with the IMF, to a 
deficit of about 750 million bolivares (total deficit of the 
nonfinancial public sector). But, we arrived at the end of the 
year with a deficit of 1.48 billion bolivares. 
  There were three reasons for this: First, they lost control 
of salaries in 1993 and they granted increases well above what 
had been agreed upon with the IMF, which was 9 percent. What 
came out of Congress was 12 percent. But, because of previous 
agreements with the petroleum workers, insurance funds and 
corporations, they reached a salary increase in real terms of 18 
percent. 
  The second reason is that they inflated revenues and relied 
on the supposition that internal revenue and customs would 
improve their efficiency by 41 percent. But customs was 
ineffective, it was completely disorganized, and internal 
revenue was no better. Therefore, that projection turned out not 
to be true. At least internal revenue began to improve, starting 
in September, but it was too late to make up for the shortfall 
of the entire year. 
  The third reason is that, in an election year, there was a 
great deal of spending, and the domestic debt increased 
spectacularly. They were contracting projects, buying goods and 
services, and not paying for them. This is why we received an 
accumulated domestic debt of almost 180 million bolivares. 
  [PRESENCIA] Is this the problem with the construction 
companies? 
  [Cossio] With everyone. Construction companies, providers of 
goods and services, payments to the social communication media, 
for example. They continued to accumulate debts. One way of 
financing was to increase the domestic debt. They stopped paying 
the complementary funds; there too we received a significant 
floating debt. 
  These are the reasons they lost control in 1993 and this is 
why they could not reach an agreement with the IMF. 
  [PRESENCIA] How are you negotiating the payment of these 
debts? 
  [Cossio] We know that we cannot pay it all in one year and 
we 
are making a payments plan. For example, we have already 
proposed to the Bolivian Chamber of Construction that we pay 
them with Treasury bonds redeemable in four years. We think we 
can comply in that period, with all due precaution and beginning 
with the oldest debts. That is one possibility. Some companies 
have accepted, others no, but the dialogue is open. 
<H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5>
<H5>  The Endless Foreign Debt </H5>
  According to figures provided by Treasury Secretary Fernando 
Cossio, the foreign debt on 31 December 1993 was $3.788 billion, 
of which $2.478 is owed by the Treasury. 
  Of the total debt, 55 percent "is of multilateral origin, 
the 
principal creditors being the IDB and the IBRD [International 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development], with 46 percent of the 
debt. The remainder are crumbs: 3 percent to the CAF [Andean 
Development Corporation] and 3 percent to FONPLATA [River Plate 
Basin Development Fund]." 
  "Then, 42 or 43 percent is bilateral, and the two principal 
creditors, with 22 percent, are Germany and Japan," he said, 
adding that 1.6 percent of the debt is owed to private banks. 
  Cossio said that being in debt to the multilateral 
organizations is an advantage and a disadvantage. An advantage 
because "most of the credits were made on concessionary terms, 
for a term of 40 years at 2 percent interest and a 10-year grace 
period. The disadvantage is that it is not renegotiable. We 
cannot go to the Club of Paris and renegotiate the multilateral 
debt." 
  He explains that the Treasury's debt was incurred primarily 
for roads, but in addition, when a state enterprise, 
corporation, potable water service, or municipality does not pay 
its debt, the debt is assumed by the Treasury. 
  "For example, we are paying $43 million in foreign debt for 
the City of La Paz, we are paying SAMAPA's [Municipal Drinking 
Water and Sewer Service] debts, and debts of corporations 
because, always, when they can no longer pay, somebody has to 
pay, and it is the poor Treasury that has to pay the piper. This 
is the reason for our reluctance to continue taking on 
commitments, because the Treasury has reached a limit. This debt 
represents about 12 percent of its budget," complains Cossio. 
  Asked whether part of foreign borrowing is used to pay old 
debts, Cossio says that only "a very small part--funds that come 
in as balance of payments support, which are usually grants in 
the type of aid program that we have with Germany, Switzerland, 
the Netherlands, and also part of balance of payments support 
from the United States--is used to pay foreign debt, but it is 
not very much." 
  Finally, he pointed out that, in 1994, the government has 
made provision to pay about $173 million to service the foreign 
debt (amortization and interest).

<H5>  Distribution of Public Investment and Allocation of Resources </H5>
  When discussing the national budget, the most important 
subjects after the salary increase are the distribution of 
public investment to the regions and the allocation of resources 
to the various government departments. 
  According to the treasury secretary, public investment will 
be carried out on the following basis: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Investments by Department (in percentages)                                   |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


<H5>  Distribution by Sector </H5>
  The treasury secretary was also asked about allocation by 
sector. Cossio said that "about 37 percent of the Treasury 
budget goes to the Ministry of Human Development (which includes 
education, health, and housing). Then, the Defense Ministry, 
with 14 percent." 
  Regarding allocations to the economic area, he explained 
that 
the portion assigned to the Treasury is very inflated, because 
it includes service on the foreign debt, which represents 20 
percent of the Treasury budget, "which is very important."

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report]ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT ENCOURAGED IN 
COCA-GROWING AREA--On 3 February Cochabamba daily LOS TIEMPOS 
reports that, during a seminar entitled "Investment 
Opportunities in the Chapare," the Cochabamba Regional 
Development Project (CORDEP), the Regional Alternative 
Development Program (PDAR), and local businessmen agreed that 
the area, which boasts good transportation and power 
infrastructure and fledgling hotel, dairy, and alternative crop 
industries, has potential for agro-industrial development. 
According to the PDAR, the region's bananas, pineapples, 
peppers, palmito, and passion fruit already have a secure 
national market, international demand, and 48 percent 
"profitability." Nevertheless, businessmen stressed that 
"serious" investment is needed to develop these industries in 
order to move away from a coca economy. LOS TIEMPOS of 2 March 
reports that, this year, the PDAR will invest its $17 million 
budget in various projects in the Chapare as part of the coca 
reduction strategy. Of this figure, $8 million will go toward 
improving 200 km of roads; agricultural production will receive 
$6 million; and social projects, $3 million. This is a departure 
from previous years when most of the PDAR's budget was destined 
for the populations of the high valleys to stem their migration 
into the Chapare coca-producing region. According to Santa Cruz 
daily EL MUNDO of 9 February, Mario Soliz, national secretary 
for social defense, assured peasants that, for each hectare of 
surplus coca they "reduced," they would receive $2,000 from the 
Directorate of Agricultural Reconversion (DIRECO) and an 
additional "compensatory bonus" of $500. 
  AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION FOR 1993--La Paz daily PRESENCIA of 
27 February reports that, according to the 1993 national 
Agricultural Survey by the National Statistical Institute, the 
volume of agricultural production (6,353,632 metric tons) rose 
2.3 percent from 1992. Overall cereal (corn, wheat, barley, and 
sorghum) production rose by 16 percent, the most significant 
increase being that of sorghum, which increased 157.4 percent 
from 45,600 metric tons in 1992 to 117,400 metric tons in 1993. 
Among commercial crops, soybeans enjoyed an "unprecedented 
increase" of 47.6 percent while cotton production decreased by 
20.4 percent. Santa Cruz Department was the country's main 
agricultural producer, followed by La Paz and Cochabamba. 
According to Cochabamba daily LOS TIEMPOS of 19 February, Edgar 
Talavera, the national secretary for agriculture and livestock, 
said that the soybean five-year plan is in effect in Santa Cruz, 
which aims at cultivating 1 million hectares for export and 
surpassing in importance the "mining and hydrocarbon 
industries." Santa Cruz daily EL MUNDO of 9 February reports 
that a Colombian investor has just launched Bolivia's largest 
soybean processing plant in Puerto Suarez, Santa Cruz 
Department. The plant will have the capacity to process 350,000 
tons of soybeans annually, enough to produce 65,000 tons of oil 
and 270,000 tons of soybean flour. The National Secretariat for 
Agriculture and Livestock estimates that $287 million will be 
invested in the sector for 1994-1997. Eighty percent will be 
financed by pledges made at the Consultative Group meeting for 
Bolivia held in December 1993, and 20 percent of the funds will 
come from the national budget for public investments. This plan, 
according to PRESENCIA 4 February, is part of a larger 1994-2003 
"Sectorial Strategy" to make agriculture and livestock raising 
the driving force of economic development. LOS TIEMPOS also 
reports that, according to the secretariat, agricultural 
prospects for 1994 are "very encouraging in general"; the 
country will be able to meet its food needs. 
  ORURO DEVELOPMENT PLANS--On 10 February, the Japanese 
ambassador to Bolivia donated equipment and machinery worth $7.2 
million for road maintenance and improvement in Oruro 
Department. Cochabamba daily LOS TIEMPOS of 11 February reports 
that President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada said that with this 
important donation, one of the country's principal "export 
corridors," the Oruro-Pisiga route, will be completed. 
Furthermore, the Capitalization Plan is widely expected to 
convert this depressed mining region into the country's new 
railway center and a "pillar" of mineral smelting. According to 
the 12 February issue of La Paz daily PRESENCIA DEL PAlS, the 
president added that Oruro, as a transport center for exports 
and a hub of regional integration, "may become the country's 
most important region." In 1994 Oruro Department will also 
receive $63 million from the government to be invested mainly in 
social projects. 
  NEW THERMOELECTRIC PLANT--The Mataral thermoelectric plant 
was inaugurated on 26 February. Situated 200 km from Santa Cruz 
de Ia Sierra, it is estimated that this plant will provide 
24-hour electrical service to 25,000 inhabitants across three 
provinces of Santa Cruz Department. The plant was financed with 
$5.5 million disbursed mainly by the Santa Cruz Regional 
Development Corporation (CORDECRUZ) and USAID. [Santa Cruz EL

  [Text] The Federal Supreme Court [STF] has approved a 
preliminary ruling in favor of the legislative branch employees 
union by 10 votes against one. This represents the suspension 
of the government decision to withhold 10.9 percent of their 
March salaries. 
  This is really a partial preliminary ruling, because the STF 
has not decided whether the wage increase should be immediately 
paid. The STF has determined that the government should adopt 
the necessary measures to have the difference deposited in the 
Bank of Brazil in the accounts of the Chamber of Deputies, the 
Senate, and the National Accounting Office. The money will 
remain at the disposal of the STF in special interest-earning 
accounts until the STF issues a definitive ruling, something 
that will probably take place in May. 
  In order to continue with the trial, Justice Ilmar Galvao 
will ask for more information from Congress and from President 
Itamar Franco, who will have 30 days to answer the STF. Soon 
after, the attorney general must give his opinion on the case. 
  The preliminary ruling issued today only favors legislative 
branch employees. In making a final ruling the STF will take 
into account the administrative decision made on 10 March, when 
it decided that judicial branch salaries should be converted 
into the URV [real value unit] rate established on the 20th of 
each month.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- Angra-2's construction will be 
resumed in the next 30 days and be financed with the $750 
million loan the Brazilian Government obtained from German 
banks. The decision was made by the Ministries of Finance, 
Planning, and Mines and Energy, which approved the Furnas 
Electric Power Plants, Inc. report on the need to finish the 
construction work. Furnas President Marcelo Siqueira on 24 March 
confirmed the news to this newspaper. 
  The construction cost is calculated at $1.5 billion. The 
Brazilian Electric Power Company, Inc. and Furnas will have to 
contribute the rest of the money. "This resumption is not 
inflationary; we will not receive any money from the Treasury," 
Siqueira said. 
  According to him, Furnas will begin to publish the public 
bid 
documents for completion of Angra-2's construction in the next 
15 days. He said the plant's civil work is practically finished 
and only the equipment still has to be assembled. This equipment 
-- most of it purchased from Germany and some of it manufactured 
in Brazil -- has been stored in warehouses at the Angra nuclear 
complex. 
  Ayrton Caiuby, director of the CNEN [National Nuclear Energy 
Commission], said that in the next few days, CNEN members will 
meet to decide the date when Angra-1 will be put into operation.

  [Text] The Science and Technology Ministry believes the 
Brazilian Government already has given its U.S. counterpart the 
required explanations about the national laws in the field of 
informatics and telecommunications. It is now U.S. Secretary of 
Commerce Ron Brown's turn to comment on the issue. A source 
linked to this newspaper reported that on 16 February Brown sent 
Science and Technology Minister Jose Israel Vargas a letter 
complaining about the difficulties U.S. companies had competing 
in the Brazilian market. 
  The letters exchanged between Brown and Vargas do not cite 
the names of the enterprises allegedly harmed, but one of the 
minister's advisers pointed out that, among the largest ones, 
the only one that does not have a manufacturing plant in Brazil 
is AT&amp;T. He added that by not having plants in the country or 
producing anything locally, AT&amp;T might be at a disadvantage 
in 
relation to competitors who are manufacturing their products in 
Brazil such as Ericsson and NEC. 
  The Science and Technology Ministry source said: "No country 
in the world has policies against industrialization." He said 
that referring to the fact that in an official bidding between 
two companies offering the same price, the company producing in 
the country is always the one chosen. 
  On 23 March, the boards of U.S. AT&amp;T and its local 
branch in 
Brazil met former Communications Minister Hugo Napoleao (Liberal 
Front Party-Piaui). Eduardo Calmon Costa, vice president and 
director of governmental and institutional relations for Brazil, 
said he had the opportunity to exchange ideas about 
privatization and ways to increase competitiveness in the 
telecommunications area. 
  In his letter dated 11 March, Vargas points out that "more 
recently, AT&amp;T, Corning, Sprint, Hughes, Continental, 
American 
Note Bank (Thomas de la Rue), Motorola, and Texas Instruments, 
just to cite a few, have been intensely supplying Brazil with 
telecommunications equipment." The science and technology 
minister said: "The Brazilian telecommunications sector is open 
to foreign participation and everything depends only on the 
companies' competitive skill. 
  In the area of informatics, IBM, Unisys, Allen-Bradley and 
several other subsidiaries of U.S. companies have been 
establishing themselves in Brazil in the last decades and been 
benefiting from tax exemptions. U.S. telecommunications 
companies should not have any difficulty in facing these fair 
and modern rules, which are being complied with by an impressive 
number of multinational companies specializing in the field."

  [Text] Lima -- The Peruvian Defense Ministry yesterday 
reported that Brazilian citizen Alcimar Marques da Silva and 
nine other individuals were arrested on 26 March in the town of 
Inapari, Peru, near the confluence of the Peruvian, Bolivian, 
and Brazilian borders. Soon after his arrest, the police found 
600 kg of cocaine base at the local airport. 
  Besides Alcimar, the group included two Colombians and seven 
Peruvians. They were intercepted by a Peruvian military patrol 
that was carrying out an operation against narcoterrorists, and 
could not give a reason for their presence in the area. Under 
questioning, the men ended up confessing where the cocaine base 
shipment was hidden, ready for embarkment. The same group was 
also discovered on 21 March, but were released as they had not 
been found to be in possession of anything. The 10 men arrested 
in Inapari were transferred by Peruvian military police to the 
city of Cusco, 1,150 km from La Paz. 
  The Peruvian military attribute to this 10-member gang a 
shipment of 400 kg of cocaine base on 18 March to the Colombian 
cartel of Cali. The military reported that in the past two 
years coca plantations have increased in the area, as have poppy 
plantations. 
  The Brazilian Federal Police and the Foreign Ministry did 
not 
learn of the arrest of the Brazilian drug trafficker until late 
27 March.

<F P=106> [Article by Luiza Pastor] </F>
  [Text] Science and Technology Minister Jose Israel Vargas 
and Shen Rongjun, Chinese National Defense, Science, Technology, 
and Industry Commission vice chairman, on 23 March signed an 
additional memorandum to the agreement currently in force 
between Brazil and the PRC for the launching of two remote 
sensoring satellites. The document establishes rules for sharing 
the task of the two satellites' telemetry and route control, as 
well as the responsibility of each country in this supervisory 
process. 
  According to the agreement's terms, during the first 12 
months after the launching of the first satellite -- the SSR-1, 
which is scheduled to go up in October 1996 -- tracking and 
control will be conducted by PRC experts. Brazil will be 
responsible for the control for the next six months, and then 
the PRC experts will resume their duties for two more months. A 
decision on who will control the satellite during the 
approximately two more years of its useful life will be made 
later by the two parties. 
  As to the second satellite -- the SSR-2, whose launch date 
still has not been decided yet because it depends on the first 
satellite's performance -- PRC experts will monitor the 
satellite's first eight months in orbit, Brazil will control the 
next six months, and the PRC experts the six months after that. 
  The agreement also officially established that any damage to 
the satellite while under the responsibility of either of the 
two parties will have to be paid for by the country controlling 
the satellite at the time. The formula for this payment, 
however, still has to be studied and the decrease in the 
satellite's value will be taken into account. 
  Funds to finance the Brazilian part of the agreement total 
$50 million, while the overall cost totals $150 million. Oscar 
Klingel, chief of staff for the Science and Technology Ministry, 
said these funds are guaranteed by President Itamar Franco's 
political decision. This decision was confirmed to the PRC 
experts last year, when the Brazilian Government decided to 
assign resources from the privatization of state-owned companies 
to the program. 
  According to Klingel, the Brazilian Government already has 
disbursed 50 percent of the overall cost, and $16 million from 
last year's transfers are in the hands of the INPE [National 
Institute of Space Research]. 
  According to the negotiated terms, the satellites will be 
launched from the Tai Yuan base, Shanxi Province. The satellite 
will be put in orbit by a "Long March" rocket from the PRC 
"Great Wall" company. Throughout their useful lives the 
satellites will transmit information on climate and the subsoil, 
which will be analyzed by Brazilian and PRC experts.
