  [Text] Cairo, 16 Mar (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AHRAM voices 
astonishment at Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati's 
remarks two days ago that Iran will not disagree with Syria if 
it signs an agreement with Israel; rather, it will show 
understanding of Syria's circumstances. 
  The newspaper says in its editorial today that the Iranian 
statement, while worthy of welcome for indicating a positive 
change in that country's attitude toward Middle East peace, 
remains surprising and raises a question as to why Iran is using 
a double standard in its attitude toward Egypt and Syria. 
  AL-AHRAM recalls Egypt's attempt, soon after President 
Mubarak took power in 1981, to open a new chapter in relations 
with Iran to promote inter-Islamic cooperation and regional 
stability and security. It adds that the end of the Iraq-Iran 
war was a strong reason for removing the tension between Egypt 
and Iran and refers to a recent statement by President Mubarak 
that an agreement to restore bilateral ties may have been 
possible at one time but the Iranian leaders were divided among 
themselves over whether to have it. 
  The paper notes that the reason given by the Iranian 
hardliners for not restoring ties with Egypt was their 
opposition to the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty and says that 
these hardliners began encouraging deviant terrorists to 
undermine stability inside Egypt and strongly opposed any 
Egyptian role in the Gulf. 
  AL-AHRAM concludes its comment by expressing the hope that 
the difference between Iran's attitude to Egypt and Syria will 
not signify that it is using a double standard. It further 
hopes that Velayati's recent remarks will spell a new 
development in Iranian policy that will promote greater 
understanding with the Arab countries, notably Egypt, for the 
general Muslim good. The paper cites the example illustrated by 
the unique understanding marking the Cairo-Damascus relationship.

  [Excerpts] Algiers, AL-HAYAH -- AL-HAYAH has learned that 
the Algerian presidency has received a secret report pointing to 
"the involvement of official quarters" in the attack on the 
Siryanah [as transliterated] ammunition factory (40 km west of 
Tazoult) in Batna wilaya and in the big escape operation from 
Tazoult prison in the same wilaya. [passage omitted] 
  The prison's administration has emphasized to AL-HAYAH that 
the number of "freed" prisoners totals 901, in addition to eight 
guards, and that 1,400 prisoners are still in the prison. The 
cell doors were opened for them, but they refused to leave. 
[passage omitted] 
  Those observing the escape operation level the accusation of 
"involvement" at high quarters in power, on the basis of the 
following: 
  1. Mohamed Karash, director of Tazoult prison had over the 
previous eight months sent eight reports to the justice 
minister, informing him of the intention to attack, the plan, 
and the timing. He says he "had not received any response until 
the day of the attack." 
  2. In an official meeting grouping Interior Minister Selim 
Saadi; General Abdelhamid Jawadi, commander of the 5th military 
zone and who is leading the combing operations in the area, in 
addition to other figures, Abdelsaghir Hamrouche, wali of Batna, 
raised the issue before participants, so Gen. Jawadi said: "Let 
them escape," meaning the Tazoult prisoners. 
  3. Intervention forces near the area arrived in Tazoult 
eight hours after informing them of the incident. 
  4. The reports sent to the presidency contain indications 
that security authorities in neighboring wilayas had knowledge 
of the attack. 
  Well-informed sources say that "in view of this accurate and 
reliable information, decisionmakers are astonished at the 
negative attitude of those concerned, who failed to take 
suitable measures to foil the attack plan." 
  Some circles in Tazoult attribute the question of "avoiding" 
foiling the operation to the following: 
  1. The site of the operation is President Liamine Zeroual's 
city, whose residents are currently subjected to storming and 
combing operations by Gen. Jawadi's forces. It is a "clear" 
message. Some people say that what had happened is a "coup 
attempt," and this rumor has been circulated throughout the 
country. 
  2. The attack was carried out while lists of prisoners to be 
released were being prepared, the lifting of the curfew 
considered, stages of the dialogue with the Islamic Salavtion 
Front planned, and the pensioning of 25 high-ranking officers 
talked about. Those opposed to the dialogue with the Islamists 
believe that this operation aborts the dialogue and national 
reconciliation idea, which President Zeroual and most Algerians 
hope would produce a comprehensive change. 
  The major attack on Tazoult prison coincided with another 
attack which is not less important than the first, namely on the 
ammunition factory situated some 40 km west of Tazoult 
(birthplace of Gen. Khaled Nezzar). The attack continued for 
five hours until the intervention of the Air Force, which 
settled in the clashes in favor of the factory's guards. 
  Political sources believe that the escalation between the 
two 
sides is aimed at thwarting Liamine Zeroual's plan, which -- as 
far as he is concerned -- is a question of life or death. The 
sources did not rule out that the next days may bring other 
surprises and important changes at the top of the military 
establishment and the government.

  [Text] The Central Security Council meeting that was held 
at Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri's palace in Quraytim at noon 
today has ended. The discussions focused on the security 
situation in the country and the results of the security 
measures that have been taken in all Lebanese areas in the wake 
of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church massacre in Zuq Mikha'il, the 
attempt to bomb the French cultural center in Ghadir, and the 
wave of rumors that accompanied these developments. Attending 
the meeting were Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul; Interior 
Minister Bisharah Mirhij; Major General Rafiq al-Hasan, Internal 
Security Forces director general; Public Security Director 
General Raymond Rufayil; Maj. Gen. Nabih Farhat, state security 
director general; Public Prosecutor Munif 'Uwaydat; Jabal Lubnan 
Governor Amin Hammud; and a number of Army and security forces 
officers. We now hear the resolutions passed at the meeting 
read by Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Fadl Dahir, secretary of the 
Internal Security Council: 
  [Begin Dahir recording] His Excellency Prime Minister Rafiq 
al-Hariri chaired a security meeting at his palace at noon 
today. Attending the meeting were the defense minister, interior 
minister, the public prosecutor, the legal investigator into the 
Sayyidat al-Najat Church bombing, the commanders of the security 
agencies, and the envoy of the Syrian security and intelligence 
department operating in Lebanon. During the meeting, the 
conferees reviewed the security situation in the country, the 
results of security investigations, and the accompanying sweeps 
and detentions. The meeting addressed the following topics: 
  1. The meeting reviewed the results of the investigations by 
the security agencies of the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat 
Church and the ensuing sweeps and detentions that targeted 
suspects and other defendants in bombings, according to legal 
arrest warrants. These sweeps covered most Lebanese areas and 
camps without discrimination from Sidon to 'Akkar. The sweeps, 
which were carried out by all Lebanese security agencies and 
occasionally backed by units of the Syrian Arab forces, resulted 
in the arrest of 127 people. 
  2. The conferees stressed the Lebanese people's right to 
resist the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon and western 
al-Biqa', noting the importance of the resistance's heroic acts 
that undermined the Israeli enemy army and its agents in the 
border strip. The conferees then discussed the ramifications of 
the appearance of gunmen in Ba'labakk on Friday [11 March], 
which is considered to be a flagrant violation of the law. They 
also reviewed the measures taken by the military public 
prosecution office against those who broke the law, particularly 
since the negative effects of these violations overshadowed the 
measures of the security agencies tasked with investigating the 
bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church. 
  3. His Excellency the prime minister stressed the need for 
the security agencies to continue their interrogations and 
security measures until the networks of terrorism and sabotage, 
which threaten the country's security, are uncovered, 
particularly since the Lebanese judiciary supervises all these 
measures. Al-Hariri pointed out that the general amnesty law 
pardons former criminals but does not prevent the security 
agencies from investigating previous or subsequent crimes to 
preserve the country's security. The public attorney said that 
the general amnesty law was based on the principle that amnesty 
can be rescinded if a person commits new crimes similar to 
previous ones. Accordingly, all these criminals remain under 
watch and can be hunted down for all crimes, including the 
pardoned ones. At the end of the meeting, al-Hariri expressed 
his satisfaction with the work of the security agencies and 
urged them to continue their work and be strict in their 
interrogations and measures against all violators and criminals, 
no matter to which party they belong. [end recording]

  [Text] Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij has stated that 
there can be no going back on the security measures, because in 
addition to expressing the will of the Lebanese people, these 
measures were the result of a decision by the government and the 
state institutions, primarily the Army. In an interview with 
AL-NAHAR, Mirhij said the security operation targets no 
individual. It covers all parts of the country. 
  Referring to the so-called siege on Samir Ja'ja', he said 
there is no siege on Ja'ja'; the proof lies in his receiving 
people and making statements. He added that the barriers laid 
around Ghidras could be for the purpose of preventing suspects 
or wanted people from going to or leaving Ghidras. 
  Responding to remarks by Ja'ja' that he has no wanted 
persons, the interior minister said that in this case there is 
no problem, because the barriers are not against Ja'ja' 
personally. Why then is every security incident being utilized 
for political purposes that are contrary to the country's 
interests? There is an attempt to make the people feel that 
they are a target of attack. This is wrong. The security 
operation aims to maintain the security of the citizen, not to 
harm him. 
  Mirhij said that reports about legal violations during the 
detention operations are unfounded speculation, because the 
security authorities operate under the law. 
  Asked how long the security measures in Ghidras will 
continue 
and whether they are concrete, Mirhij said: When the Army wants 
to enter, it will enter Ghidras and the home of Ja'ja'. Every 
Lebanese house is a house for the Army. We will bring out the 
criminals and security violators from any figure or official's 
house. He added that talk of making Ja'ja' a hero is 
supposition. If people go to him, it means he is not under 
siege. There is no one we would want to cancel out politically 
unless he cancels himself out. Let everyone abide by the laws 
and national accord and no one will cancel him out. 
  Answering a question, Mirhij denied that the authorities 
overlooked events in Ba'labakk. He said: We are pursuing the 
perpetrators. What happened there has been exaggerated to make 
the state appear biased.

  [Text] Sidon, March 15 (AFP)--Iranian-backed guerrillas 
ambushed an Israeli army patrol in occupied south Lebanon on 
Tuesday [15 March], provoking retaliatory shelling, security 
services said. 
  The Islamic Resistance, Hizballah's armed wing, said "a 
Merkava tank exploded and a truck fell into the valley in 
flames" in the attack at the entrance to al-Shaqif Castle in 
Israel's self-declared security zone. 
  Lebanese security services confirmed the attack but could 
provide no information on eventual casualties. 
  Israeli tanks and artillery then shelled woods and the area 
around villages opposite the Crusader-era castle while Israeli 
helicopter gunships machinegunned targets in the region, police 
said. 
  There were no immediate reports of casualties following the 
Israeli attacks.

  [Text] This evening resistance men attacked an Israeli 
patrol in 'Arnun, on the edge of the occupied border strip. 
Following that, Israeli forces shelled the al-Hamra farm and 
the area around Qal'at al-Shaqif, where the resistance has 
positions, using 155-mm shells, as our correspondent in the 
south reported. The Israeli shelling was accompanied by 
warplane and helicopter overflights of the region; the planes 
dropped flares. Two Israeli helicopters raked the valleys of 
the al-Hamra farm and the area near the attack, for which 
Hizballah claimed responsibility. There were no reports of 
casualties. 
  Earlier, Israeli forces sporadically shelled the hills of 
Iqlim al-Tuffah, particularly Jabal Safi, Luwayzah, Mlita, and 
Sujud.

<F P=106> [Commentary by news research and commentary group] </F>
  [Text] While the United States continues its serious 
efforts not to accept any UN resolution against the Zionist 
regime that would guarantee international security for the 
Palestinians, the White House diplomatic apparatus has spared no 
effort for the resumption of the talks between the compromising 
Palestinians and Arab countries and the Zionist regime. 
  Within this framework, U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke to 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and asked him to decide on a new 
date for talks with Israel. In a telephone conversation, Warren 
Christopher also called on Yasir 'Arafat to begin negotiations 
with the Zionist regime. Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator in 
the compromising talks, endorsed the issue in his meeting with 
'Arafat in Tunis. 
  With this concerted effort, the United States is seeking to 
salvage the Zionist regime and to depict the blood of the 
victims of the catastrophic massacre of the fasting Muslim 
worshipers in the al-Ibrahimi shrine in occupied Palestine as 
worthless. The more the level of the direct involvement of the 
Zionist regime's armed forces in the tragedy of the massacre of 
the Palestinians transpires, and new documentary evidence 
continues to emerge, the greater the White House effort to 
support the terrorist echelons in Israel. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton is quite unattentive to the 
wounded sensitivities of the Palestinian Muslim nation and the 
indignation of the international public and the people of the 
Islamic world and is ignoring the repeated violations of human 
rights and international norms by the Tel Aviv officials. He is 
expected to meet Yitzhaq Rabin, the Zionist regime's prime 
minister, at the White House. Rabin has met the U.S. 
secretaries of state and defense in Washington and had military 
and political coordination with them. 
  It is being stated that this Friday, that is, three weeks 
after Hebron, finally, the Security Council will issue a 
resolution regarding the killing of the fasting worshipers at 
the shrine of the Prophet Abraham, peace be upon him. Since the 
incident, a resolution has repeatedly been promised; in 
practice, it has not been issued, due to U.S. opposition. 
  It appears unlikely that this promise will be fulfilled to 
mitigate people's anger over the meeting between the U.S. 
President and the terrorist head of the Zionist regime. 
Washington's unconditionally supportive policy for the Zionist 
regime's officials, which can have no other effect but to 
enhance their audacity to suppress the Palestinian Muslims, 
remains a source of concern.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] After the lapse of two weeks since the massacre of 
Palestinian worshipers at the al-Khalil mosque, convening of the 
UN Security Council has, once again, been delayed. Hence, 
issuance of a resolution condemning Israel, too, has been 
postponed another time. 
  The negligence on the part of the Security Council, in its 
capacity as an international legislative body, in issuing a 
condemnation on the tragedy, involving the massacre of scores of 
innocent human beings, undoubtedly points to a bitter event. 
This shows the influence and intervention of the United States 
in this international forum, which is supposed to redress the 
wrongdoings against world masses. 
  Over the past fortnight, the United States has embarked on a 
widespread effort to pressure the PLO leaders in a bid to 
restart the stalemated talks between the PLO and Tel Aviv. 
Also, by pressuring the Security Council, America has prevented 
the issuance of even a ceremonial resolution in condemnation of 
the Zionist regime. Following the massacre in the mosque of 
prophet Abraham, the PLO, by withdrawing from the talks with 
Israel, has made resumption of the negotiations subject to 
fulfilment of a number of conditions. The PLO conditions for 
returning to the talks call for the presence of armed 
international observers in the occupied regions, disarmament of 
the Jews resident in settlements, and guarantee of the 
Palestinians' security. 
  In the opinion of political observers, these conditions have 
been set forth for securing the concession from Israel rather 
than blocking the already stalemated talks process on Gaza and 
Jerico. However these conditions have come to face an ultimatum 
from the Washington-Tel Aviv axis. This is why the United 
States has said that issuance of any resolution in condemnation 
of Israel will be subject to withdrawal of the conditions set by 
the PLO leaders. In fact, one has doubts about the U.S. warning 
given to the PLO leaders that in the event of nonwithdrawal of 
their conditions, Washington will veto the Security Council 
resolution. 
  In the opinion of political analysts, efforts are being made 
so that no concession may be taken from Israel and no mention 
made in the Security Council resolution of Israeli crimes and 
breach of human rights in the occupied lands; the subject of 
Beyt ol-Moqqadas will also be ignored. These are the matters 
which can well be observed in the Israeli lobby and in its 
influence in the White House. 
  Irrespective of the type of U.S.-Israel ties, what is 
regretted by the world public opinion is the UN role in its 
capacity as the highest authority and as a shelter for the world 
nations. Regrettably this role, on account of U.S. 
interventions, aimed at giving a specific direction to it, has 
been turned into an ineffective one, making the UN a tool of the 
United States.

  [Text] Damascus, 15 Mar (SANA)--The newspaper AL-BA'TH has 
stressed that based on its structure, nature, teachings, and 
ideology, the Zionist entity was established as a fascist entity 
and will continue to be based on the same firm and declared 
principles of the mythical Zionist ideology that considers its 
followers superior to the rest of mankind. 
  In a comment today, the paper says: Beyond any doubt, old 
and new Zionist history proves the bloody and terroristic nature 
of this entity. The Hebron massacre alone provides sufficient 
proof of the Zionist thought prevailing in Israel. 
  The paper notes: Zionist settlers did not appear in a 
vacuum. They have always been the realistic and true embodiment 
of Israeli policy, since the usurpation of Palestine. These 
settlers were armed and instructed to usurp Arab territories. 
  Concluding, the paper says: It is regrettable that many 
sides in the world still refuse to open their eyes to the 
Zionist-Israeli fact. The proof is the current farce about the 
holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which has been going on for 
more than two weeks at the UN Security Council. 
  In its editorial today under the headline "The Hebron 
Massacre," the newspaper TISHRIN says: The holy al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre has torn all the veils of peace behind which the 
Rabin government was hiding. The massacre exposed the true 
nature of this government. 
  In the article written by its Editor in Chief Muhammad Khayr 
al-Wadi, the paper stresses: There is no difference between the 
policy of the Shamir government and that of the Rabin 
government. They are both hostile to peace, refuse to 
relinquish the occupied Arab territories, and each of them seeks 
to achieve the same goal, namely, the establishment of greater 
Israel. 
  The paper notes: The whole world expected the international 
community to take practical and effective measures concerning 
the Hebron massacre to protect unarmed civilians and to deter 
aggressors. However, disappointment was great when it was 
proven that the powers dominating the Security Council are still 
using double standards every time the issue is related to Israel. 
  Concluding, the paper says: What happened at the holy 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque is the logical result of the policy of 
indifference to Israel, and to spoiling it. The continuation of 
such a policy will lead to further Zionist massacres and to 
further disruption of the prospects of achieving a just and 
comprehensive peace in the region.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: Grief and sorrow envelop all parts of 
the occupied Arab territories on the eve of the blessed 'Eid 
al-Fitr. The Israeli military siege is being tightened on all 
Arab citizens and is preventing the provision of food, medicine, 
and basic needs for children and sick people. The Israeli Army 
continues its acts of repression, torture, and indiscriminate 
shooting. The injured people number in the scores everyday. 
The images of the horrifying massacre in the holy al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque, where worshipers were killed by Zionist settlers while 
performing their prayers, are still fresh in the minds of the 
sons of the occupied homeland and remind everyone that there can 
be no security and comfort until the removal of the Israeli 
nightmare of occupation. The peace aspired to by the hearts and 
the souls is very farfetched because Israel, very simply, does 
not want peace and its objective is to expand and build 
settlements. 
  This is in terms of the occupied territories. As for 
southern Lebanon, the barbaric Israeli bombardment has become a 
daily practice. This practice intensified in recent days to 
include as many villages and towns as possible and to cause as 
much human and material losses as possible. 
  This is the Israel which falsely claims peace and works 
against it. This is the Israel which those in the Western world 
want to raise the banner of peace while they are tempting it 
with billions of dollars, economic aid, and sophisticated 
weapons of destruction, are racing to strike military deals with 
it, and are providing it with nuclear technology. The results 
are totally the opposite. Israel's arrogance and rejection of 
peace is building up and its greed for expansion and settlement 
building is increasing. Israel is using weapons the West is 
placing in its hands to perpetrate massacres and crimes and to 
foil the hopes for peace. 
  While the Security Council is supposed to rise up to its 
international responsibilities and take the initiative to 
protect the Palestinian and Lebanese people from Israel's daily 
crimes, this highest international authority is drowning in the 
labyrinths of endless deliberations. It is seeking a resolution 
that satisfies Israel and does not hurt the feelings of its 
rulers. As for the rulers of Israel, they continue to make 
misleading statements. They claim peace and concern about the 
Palestinians while it is known that one of their senior military 
commanders revealed that the Israeli Army has strict orders not 
to stand in the way of settlers even if they were shooting at 
defenseless Arab citizens. 
  The Washington talks have entered their third year. Not a 
single Israeli negotiator uttered the word "withdrawal." The 
Arabs and Syria talked about a full, real, just, and 
comprehensive peace. No one heard Israel say the word "full 
withdrawal." Indeed, the Israelis' main concern in Washington 
was to drown the talks in the labyrinth of their security 
demands and turn the peace process into mere security 
arrangements that would guarantee for Israel, in the name of 
security, the continuation of its occupation, the continuation 
of acts of repression and terrorism, keeping the settlements 
and settlers, and the freedom of stockpiling all kinds of 
weapons. This is at a time when Israeli shells are continuously 
bombarding southern Lebanon, when Palestinians are being killed 
while performing their prayers to God, and when any Syrian 
citizen in the occupied Golan, who affirms his affiliation to 
Syria and Arabism, is being repressed. 
  The peace process in Middle East so far has been receiving a 
response from one side; that is, the Arab side. As for Israel, 
it did not offer anything and continues to blackmail, evade, 
prevaricate, and procrastinate. Moreover, it is clear that 
Israel will not submit to the conditions of a just peace unless 
the international community makes an effective and decisive move 
to impose respect for UN principles and resolutions. 
  Tempting Israel with billions of dollars and arsenals of 
weapons so far has only yielded opposite results. It added to 
the arrogance of the rulers of Israel and to their disregard of 
all human values. The massacre of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque will 
continue to be a nightmare that haunts those who encouraged 
Israel, especially since it will not be the last massacre. 
Other more horrifying massacres will inevitably be perpetrated 
if the international community does not put an end to Zionist 
belligerence by ending the occupation and restoring rights.

  [Text] The words I heard at the meeting hall of the 
Government Palace in Beirut on 16 September 1993 during the 
final meeting of the first session of the Syrian-Lebanese 
Follow-Up and Coordination Committee are still ringing in my 
ears. It was said then, with full clarity, that the Economic 
and Social Coordination and Cooperation Agreement between Syria 
and Lebanon will make the citizens of both countries feel the 
importance of what took place. They will sense, through the 
cancellation of the import permit, which will enable Syrian 
merchants to import Lebanese goods without a permit, that 
something important has indeed been achieved this time on the 
level of bilateral relations, and that all this will reflect 
positively on the living conditions in both countries. 
  Since that date, many meetings have taken place at the 
highest levels, as well as at other levels, and documents, 
signatures, and ratifications have been exchanged. Recently, on 
9 February 1994, the Lebanese paper AL-SHA'B reported that the 
Lebanese Chamber of Deputies ratified 14 draft laws; foremost, 
the agreements with Syria. The draft law under Decree No. 4373, 
which permits the Government to conclude cooperation agreements 
between Lebanon and Syria, was submitted to the Chamber for 
discussion and ratified. 
<H5>  Implementation </H5>
  With this measure, everything has become ready for 
implementation, especially once the signed, ratified, and 
legally approved documents have been exchanged. This is a major 
step forward, because the agreement provides for measures that 
will lead to economic integration between Syria and Lebanon and 
the establishment of a Syrian-Lebanese common market, including 
joint industrial and tourist projects. 
  Under this agreement, eight committees were formed to carry 
out production and services projects in all fields. 
<H5>  What Has Been Achieved So Far </H5>
  Many efforts have been exerted, several meetings have been 
held, and numerous delegations have come to Syria while others 
have gone to Lebanon, all pending the moment the implementation 
will begin. The time is approaching, and in the course of all 
these activities the two sides have defined the bases for 
applying the Certificate of Origin, as follows: 
  - The Arab Certificate of Origin used for facilitating and 
developing trade between the Arab countries will also be used to 
certify the national identity of goods exchanged between the two 
countries. 
  - In light of the discussions that took place between the 
two 
countries concerning the provisions of the Certificate of Origin 
and the methods of certifying their veracity; and in accordance 
with the decisions made by the Follow-Up and Coordination 
Committee during its meeting on 15-16 September 1993 on these 
subjects, the two sides decided to make the following 
recommendations: 
<H5>  1. Certificate of Origin: </H5>
  A. Applying the Certificate of Origin (as per attached) 
approved under the Agreement on Facilitating and Developing 
Trade Between the Arab Countries, provided this certificate is 
endorsed by the customs departments in both countries in 
accordance with the current procedure between them. 
  B. Instructing the customs departments in both countries to 
fix a date in order to put this certificate into effect after 
these minutes have been ratified by the quarters concerned in 
both countries and after an agreement has been reached in 
principle concerning its format and dimensions. The two 
departments shall conclude their work within a period of two 
months from this date. 
  C. The customs departments in both countries shall, when 
necessary, exchange information about checking the veracity of 
the Lebanese or Syrian Certificates of Origin. They may take 
the necessary measures in this regard through coordination -- 
including the exchange of visits -- with the competent 
departments in both countries. 
<H5>  2. Cancellation of Import Permit: </H5>
  - Canceling the current import permit with regard to the 
exchange of goods and commodities between the two countries and 
replacing it in Syria by the Import Approval (as per attached 
model) under the provisions of Paragraph B of Article 5 of the 
Economic and Social Cooperation and Coordination Agreement 
signed between the two countries on 16 September 1993. 
  - The Syrian side has explained that all products of 
Lebanese 
origin can be traded with Syria within the limits of the foreign 
trade ordinances and the currencies used in Syria, whether or 
not these products are included in the lists attached to the 
1953 agreement. Exemptions from and reductions of customs 
duties are incorporated in these lists. 
  - The Lebanese side explained that all commodities of Syrian 
origin can be traded with Lebanon and also imported in 
accordance with the existing laws in Lebanon, and that 
exemptions from and reductions of customs duties are also 
incorporated in the lists attached to the 1953 agreement. 
<H5>  The Joint Economic Committee </H5>
  On 10 January 94, a Lebanese economic delegation led by 
Lebanese Economy Minister Hagop Demerdjian visited Damascus. A 
meeting was held at the Economy Ministry in Damascus under the 
chairmanship of the ministers of economy and foreign trade of 
both countries. The meeting was attended by Nasri Khuri, 
secretary general of the Higher Syrian-Lebanese Council, and 
members of the Syrian and Lebanese delegations. As a result of 
this meeting, it was decided: 
  1. To form the Joint Economic Committee provided for in 
Clause (i) Paragraph (B) of Article (4) of the Economic and 
Social Cooperation and Coordination Agreement under the 
chairmanship of the two ministers of economy in both countries 
and the representatives of the competent departments. The 
committee shall undertake the following tasks: 
  2. To discuss the scientific means and formulas needed to 
implement the Economic and Social Cooperation and Coordination 
Agreement signed between the two countries on 16 Sepember 1993, 
especially Paragraph (B) of Article (2) which deals with: 
  A. Coordinating the internal costs of national goods 
exchanged between the two countries in order to achieve parity 
in these costs, and therefore free the goods from any 
restrictions.. 
  B. Proceeding gradually toward the free exchange of national 
goods and commodities between the two countries and freeing 
these goods and commodities fropm any restrictions in accordance 
with the lists of commodities and products whose internal costs 
have been equated and endorsed by the Economic Committee 
established under this agreement. 
  C. Coordinating all other fields of economic cooperation, 
especially the transfer of capital between the two countries in 
order to free trade between them and to enable them to establish 
joint ventures. 
  D. Enabling nationals of both countries to carry out all 
types of economic and professional activities to ensure equal 
opportunities for them in accordance with existing laws and 
regulations. 
  E. Encouraging the establishment of joint economic ventures, 
taking into consideration the coordination and standardization 
of privileges, securities, facilities, and exemptions, and 
applying in this regard the provisions of existing laws, 
including those concluded within the framework of the Arab 
League and its affiliate organizations. 
  F. Coordinating economic and trade cooperation with the 
other 
states and regional and international organizations. 
  G. Revising the lists attached to the economic agreement 
signed between the two countries in 1953 with the view to 
expanding and developing these lists. 
  It was also decided that the two sides will submit their 
ideas on how to achieve these tasks gradually, provided 
attention is given to the following priorities: 
  A. Specifying the topics and questions dealing with trade 
and 
the proposed solutions for them. 
  B. Revising the commodity lists attached to the economic 
agreement of 1953 with the view to developing and expanding them 
in line with the economic developments in both countries. 
  C. Studying the minutes of the technical committee with the 
view to defining the bases for applying the certificate of 
origin. Each side will inform the other of its own ideas 
through the general secretariat of the Higher Syrian-Lebanese 
Council within a period of one month from this date prior to 
discussing these ideas in the meeting which is scheduled to take 
place in Beirut at a date to be fixed by the secretary general.

<F P=106> [By our diplomatic editor] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, March 2:- The talks here later this 
month between U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia 
Robin Raphel and Indian officials on Indo-American relations are 
expected to pave the way for the Prime Minister's trip to 
Washington towards the middle of the year. 
  Ms. Raphel, who has become controversial due to her 
statements questioning the validity and finality of Kashmir's 
accession to India, and who insists on visiting India shall be 
extended due courtesies. She will be able to meet officials as 
well as political leaders during her five-day stay from March 
22. She has even sought a meeting with the Prime Minister, which 
could not be arranged earlier when she left India to take up her 
new assignment in the State Department. 
  The U.S. Government is currently engaged in a damage 
limitation exercise following Ms. Raphel's unwelcome 
pronouncements and has assured the Indian Government that no 
anti-lndia bias or pro-Pakistan tilt has overtaken the Clinton 
Administration and that relations with India remain strong and 
are bound to grow. Some of President Clinton's remarks 
regarding Kashmir and human rights must be viewed in the context 
of U.S. domestic policy compulsions and not in that of 
Indo-American relations, which continue to expand. 
  As regards Kashmir, the U.S. always believed that the issue 
should be resolved bilaterally by India and Pakistan under the 
Simla Agreement and Washington is not projecting itself as a 
mediator. It has no strategic interests in the State but 
desires that the problem be resolved in the interest of peace 
and stability of the subcontinent. 
  The External Affairs Ministry was initially lukewarm to Ms. 
Raphel's visit and did not agree to any of the dates suggested 
by her. President Clinton's as well as Ms. Raphel's remarks 
were appropriately responded to and their criticism rebutted. 
However, the new Foreign Secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan, as well 
as the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, took the 
view that points of difference should not spoil the otherwise 
sound relations between the world's two largest democracies and 
that there are areas where India and the U.S. should work 
jointly and effectively. Discussions could be held to find 
common ground and they could even agree to disagree on some 
points. A discussion could help articulate each other's 
concerns and remove misconceptions which were often at the root 
of mispronouncements. 
  It is thus clear that the Indian officials shall be willing 
to listen to what Ms. Raphel has to say in the hope that she too 
will be in a mood to hear patiently what they have to say. The 
Clinton Administration's South Asia policy has been articulated 
repeatedly by Ms. Raphel and other officials and hence its 
reiteration is not necessary. Any impression that the present 
Administration has a closed mind on subjects such as Kashmir, 
human rights, and nuclear non-proliferation will not further the 
Indo-U.S. dialogue. Both sides must be prepared to listen to 
each other's point of view and appreciate mutual concerns. 
  The Indian Government is appreciative of U.S. support for 
its 
economic liberalisation policies and feels that there ought to 
be no reasons for relations between the two countries to be 
strained on the economic level as these continue to be strong 
and friendly. U.S. is India's largest trading partner and 
overseas investor. Therefore, the relations between the two 
countries should not be determined only on the political level 
where differences of opinion exist. For a balanced view these 
should be judged both on economic and political levels. The 
economic relations could become more friendly and deep and 
sincere effort made to remove irritants on the political front. 
  Notice has also been taken of Ms. Raphel's recent 
observation 
that it is not correct to say that Indo-U.S. relations have 
soured because of public disagreement over issues, such as 
Kashmir. "The reality is much beyond disagreements we may have. 
It also includes close cooperation in education, culture, 
science and technology and our rapidly growing commercial 
relations." 
  At the same time the Indian side makes it clear that any arm 
twisting on Kashmir shall not be entertained. If the U.S. had 
any doubts about the unanimity of public opinion on this issue 
those must have been removed by the Parliamentary resolution 
asserting that Kashmir is an inalienable part of India and 
Pakistan must vacate the area under its illegal occupation since 
1947. No Government can side-step the resolution and negotiate 
Kashmir's status and still hope to survive. However, agreements 
are possible on such issues as demilitarisation of the Siachen 
area and Sir Creek, Tulbul Barrage, nuclear confidence building 
measures and the like, on which concrete proposals have been 
sent by India to Pakistan. 
  As regards nuclear and missile non-proliferation in South 
Asia, notice has been taken of President Clinton's own 
observation that the U.S. and others "take into account both 
Indian and Pakistani domestic political concerns and regional 
security threat perceptions, including those extending beyond 
the two countries themselves."

<F P=106> [Report by Yerah Tal] </F>
  [Excerpt] Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir said 
yesterday that in the Tunis talks, "progress was made in forging 
renewed understanding between the sides and in examining the 
possibilities for continuing the peace process." Savir said 
that "Israel and the PLO understand that there is a need to 
create an appropriate atmosphere in the territories to alleviate 
the situation and instill a greater sense of security and trust 
in the political process." 
  The Israeli representatives said that Israel is prepared to 
make additional concessions toward the Palestinians and to agree 
to expand the Palestinian police force to 9,000 men and increase 
the number of weapons at its disposal. Israel had earlier 
agreed to a 6,000-strong force. 'Arafat is not satisfied with 
these steps and is demanding a series of additional moves, most 
of which are unacceptable to Israel. 
  [Tel Aviv 'AL HAMISHMAR in Hebrew on 16 March, in a related 
report by Pe'erli Shahar on pages 1 and 8, adds that "in the 
delegation's meetings with Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis, it was made 
clear to him that Israel has agreed to the deployment of 
international forces throughout the territories, except for 
Jerusalem, on condition that they are unarmed."] 
  Referring to the specific steps to be taken, Savir said that 
Israel, for its part, took very tough measures against the 
extremists, but added that "there are steps that must be 
coordinated with the Palestinians to prepare the ground for the 
resumption of the process." Savir noted that the Tunis talks 
advanced the possibility of a direct dialogue on those issues. 
"It is obvious that Israel is serious about its intention to 
contribute to security on the ground for Arabs and Israelis 
alike, and the Palestinian side made it clear that despite the 
difficult obstacles along the way, it intends to implement the 
Declaration of Principles, which will bring a drastic change on 
the ground." 
  Savir also said that "those who speak about stopping the 
process in the wake of the terrible massacre are, in fact, 
caving in to extremists and murderers, and that is not in the 
interest of either side." Savir believes, therefore, that the 
process will continue to make progress and that the Tunis talks 
were a step in that direction. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by police affairs correspondent Uri Kohen-Aharonov] </F>
  [Text] A short time ago, detectives of the Israel Police 
National Unit for Serious Crimes Investigation locked the 
offices of the Kakh and Kahana Hay movements in Jerusalem with 
chains. Our police affairs correspondent Uri-Kohen Aharonov has 
just returned from the site and brings us his report: 
  Tonight was yet another phase in the action by the 
authorities against extremist elements in Israel. Following a 
series of administrative arrests and weapons confiscations, 
particularly among settlers in the territories, police 
detectives tonight acted against the two big centers of the 
Kahana Hay and Kakh movements in Jerusalem. They locked the 
offices of Kahana Hay on Agrippas Street with chains, leaving a 
closure order signed by the police commissioner on the door, and 
then proceeded to the offices of Kakh on Usishkin Street. 
  In the closure order, the police commissioner wrotes that 
based on Article 6 of the Antiterror Act of 1948 he finds that 
these two centers constitute bases of terrorist organizations 
and consequently orders their closure for a period of six months 
as of this evening, 15 March 1994. We learned from police 
sources tonight that other measures may be taken tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>
  [Text] Senior IDF [Israel Defense Forces] sources, 
including Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, commander of the IDF in 
the West Bank, issued warnings as far back as December 1993 
regarding the danger of attacks on Arabs by settlers. Despite 
this, Mufaz ordered all the units in the West Bank to refrain 
from firing at settlers. 
  A document drawn up by the head of the military government 
branch of the General Staff Operations Department, Lieutenant 
Colonel Avi'el Dagan, includes a warning about various 
disturbances and attacks by settlers. The General Staff ordered 
that such a pamphlet be drawn up, and it deals with law 
enforcement with regard to the Jewish population in the West 
Bank and Gaza. The pamphlet was distributed in the IDF on 12 
December 1993. 
  The pamphlet begins with the following: "As a result of the 
signing of the Declaration of Principles with the PLO, a new 
reality has been created in the field. We have recently 
encountered several instances in which Israelis in the West Bank 
and Gaza took steps that disturb the public order. The purpose 
of this document is to provide detailed instructions regarding 
procedures in such cases." 
  The document defines the distribution of authority between 
the IDF and the police with regard to law enforcement in the 
territories and says that the police will deal only with 
criminal cases. 
  The second page of the pamphlet details three categories of 
anticipated activities by settlers: 
  "A. Public disturbances, protests, demonstrations on the 
roads and at junctions, burning tires, setting up roadblocks and 
other obstacles along the travel axes, and other protest moves 
characterized by activity that has been coordinated among 
various elements. 
  "B. Public disturbances in populated areas, riots, breaking 
windows, overturning stalls, etc. 
  "C. Violent activity that may endanger lives by stone 
throwing, burning property, use of cold-steel weapons, or 
shooting." 
  The pamphlet also specifically mentions those locations in 
which activity of this type is expected. It says: "The centers 
of such activity in the West Bank and Gaza are, among other 
places, Hebron and its environs and the Ramallah area...." 
  Despite everything written in it, the pamphlet informs the 
soldiers, in an underlined passage, that "it is stressed that a 
soldier shall not use arms against an Israeli." The pamphlet 
also includes instructions to officers to clarify to their 
soldiers what is considered proper behavior toward Israelis who 
disturb the peace and break the law. Thus, paragraph 5 says 
that "if the suspect resists arrest, reasonable force may be 
used to detain him and bring him to the nearest police station. 
Handcuffs are not to be used except in extreme cases and when 
there is no other way to execute the arrest." 
  Yesterday, sources in the General Staff confirmed that the 
pamphlet was distributed among the soldiers in the West Bank. 
They noted that the General Staff supported Mufaz's decision to 
distribute the pamphlet. They pointed out, however, that the 
IDF has passed to the commission of inquiry that is 
investigating the Hebron massacre other pamphlets and findings 
that are also related to the testimony of Lt. Col. Me'ir Tayar, 
the commander of the Border Police in Hebron, regarding the 
order not to shoot at settlers under any circumstances. 
  A senior IDF source said that the pamphlet confirms the 
claim, raised before the commission, that the commanders in the 
field received specific orders from the top echelons.

  [Text] Senior IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers, 
including the deputy chief of staff, the coordinator of 
activities in the territories, the commander of IDF troops and 
the head of the Civil Administration in Judaea and Samaria, 
conferred this afternoon with Hebron dignitaries, including the 
mayor and members of the Chamber of Commerce. 
  Muhyi-al-Din Nimr, the spokesman of the Chamber of Commerce, 
told our correspondent Moti Amir that the dignitaries asked the 
officers to lift the curfew on the city and to allow the 
residents to return to work and resume normal life. According 
to Nimr, Major General Shahaq voiced his sorrow over the 
massacre in Hebron, and said he knew that the enemies of peace 
had become stronger as a result of this deed. Shahaq pointed 
out that after the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
it will also be Hebron's turn to attain Palestinian self-rule. 
  The dignitaries asked the IDF officers to reduce the 
friction 
between IDF troops and the local population in order to avert 
confrontations and riots once the curfew is lifted.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Moshe Ishon: "The Raid in Hebron"] </F>
  [Text] The raid carried out by the police and the security 
forces against Jewish settlers in the center of Hebron was both 
unjustified and untimely, although it ostensibly stems from the 
government's decision to outlaw Kakh and Kahana Hay and to 
define these two movements as terrorist groups on par with Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement]. We were astonished when the 
raiders appeared at Rabbi Levinger's door with a warrant for his 
and his wife's arrest. 
  The alacrity shown by the police and the security forces is 
very surprising. If they had incriminating evidence against the 
residents of Jewish Hebron, then why were they silent until now? 
The excuse commonly given yesterday, that the government could 
not arrest suspects before it outlawed the Jewish terror 
organizations, is unacceptable. 
  This explanation is not only implausible, it is also 
fundamentally wrong. The police are entitled to arrest 
suspects, even without a warrant issued by the government 
against the Kakh and Kahana Hay activists, and if they have not 
done so to date, the only reason can be that they apparently did 
not have enough evidence to convict anyone. 
  There is also reason to believe that even today they do not 
have incriminating evidence against the suspects. Therefore, 
there is no alternative but to view this raid as a deliberate 
attempt to mollify certain elements, whether among the left-wing 
partners of the Rabin government or elements linked to the PLO 
and its associates, who do not conceal their demand to run the 
Jews out of Hebron. 
  It is worth recalling that at the cabinet session two days 
ago, Minister Ya'ir Tzaban demanded to apply the orders issued 
against Kakh and Kahana Hay on Rabbi Moshe Levinger since he is 
suspected of having carried out actions ostensibly bordering on 
terrorism. The prime minister, however, objected to this 
proposal, noting that it would not hold up before the High Court 
of Justice. 
  This apparently, did not stop the police from raiding Hebron 
and arresting Jews, even those who have no direct or indirect 
links to the "Jewish terror organizations." 
  Anyway, it is doubtful that Jewish terrorist organizations 
really exist. Nevertheless, even if there are suspicions to 
that effect, there is no room to mention them in the same breath 
with Hamas and the PLO, as Attorney General Mikha'el Ben-Horin 
did when he presented the decrees issued by the Rabin government 
against Kakh and Kahana Hay. 
  The raid on the Jewish settlement in Hebron takes us back to 
the darkest of times. It recalls the days of the British 
Mandate, when British policemen would frequently arrest Jews to 
protect, as it were, public law and order, instead of arresting 
Arabs who murdered Jews. 
  If two days ago, when the government decision was issued, 
people could be found to justify it, the next day, when the raid 
in Hebron to arrest "Jewish suspects" began, it suddenly 
transpired that this was a totally new direction in the 
government's policy which is meant to hurt Jews without first 
checking whether arrests without a court warrant, as is 
customary in democratic regimes, are necessary. 
  Hence, we would not be overstating our case if we said that 
the recent steps adopted by the government jeopardize Israeli 
democracy. The State of Israel might become a police state. 
Perhaps it is only symbolical that it was the police minister 
who replied to the no-confidence motions in the Knesset 
yesterday instead of the prime minister, who by all logic should 
have responded to them rather than send a proxy.... 
  To sum up, the raid in Hebron should give democracy 
supporters in the State of Israel cause for concern. The 
government should be deprived of the right to carry out 
"administrative arrests" of its political rivals. 
  In a democratic state, decisions are made by the courts, 
even 
when reference is to supposedly terrorist activities.... 
  It is about time the Rabin government understood this!

  [Excerpts] Riyadh, 15 Mar (SPA) -- A responsible source 
made the following statement to SPA today: 
  Many people were amazed by and even condemned the statement 
by Iranian religious leader 'Ali Khamene'i in his sermon of the 
blessed 'Id al-Fitr, in which he alleged that the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia was creating difficulties for the Iranian pilgrims. 
Everybody knows that the 17th meeting of the foreign ministers 
of the Islamic states, held in Amman in the Hashemite Kingdom of 
Jordan from 3 to 7 Sha'ban 1408 AH, corresponding to 21-25 March 
1988, issued a resolution in which the numbers of pilgrims were 
fixed on the basis of the ratio of people from every state to 
the number of Muslims in the world. Thus, the number of Iranian 
pilgrims was fixed according to the text of the above-mentioned 
resolution, which the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia abides by, as well 
as all the Islamic states that signed the resolution in the 
interest of all Muslims. 
  If some people make allegations which are not objective, out 
of a personal motive in order to achieve purely local aims, then 
it is up to the Iranian people to assess and be aware of that. 
  The source added: 
  It is a blessing from God Almighty on the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia and its king, government, and people that we are honored 
to serve the Two Holy Places and look after the comfort and 
safety of pilgrims, so they are able to perform the rites of 
pilgrimage and minor pilgrimage and visit with all ease. In 
order to achieve this noble aim and to allow capacity to go hand 
in hand permanently with the continuous increase in the number 
of pilgrims wishing to perform pilgrimage, it is necessary to 
lay down continuous programs for extending the Two Holy Places 
and provide additional space in the pilgrimage areas. Despite 
this, and because of the limitation in time and space, the 
capacity of accommodation requires that one stick to rules in 
order to give the opportunity to all Muslims from the East and 
West of the world according to just quotas, and we hope that 
everybody cooperates with us in the interest of all. [passage 
omitted] 
  Regarding Iranian leader 'Ali Khamene'i, who said "the 
Muslim 
Iranian people should be given priority over the other peoples 
in performing this duty" i.e. the pilgrimage duty, the source 
stated all Muslims are equal before God and that there is no 
difference between an Arab and a non-Arab, or between a white 
and a black other than in piety. God Almighty said "The most 
honored of you in the sight of God is (he who is) the most 
righteous of you." [Koranic verse]. 
  The source said in his statement that shouldering the 
responsibility before God and the guests of His house [holy 
shrine of Ka'bah], and consequently before our conscience, was a 
matter which we were keen to preserve and endeavor to perform 
with all our strength "and we shall not pay attention to the low 
statements made by some or the fabricated media campaigns aimed 
at causing provocation, confusion, and sowing the seeds of 
sedition among the Muslims." 
  The source further said: 
  We are extremely astonished at the contradiction there is in 
the way the Iranian leaders are talking to us. While President 
'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, president of the Islamic Republic 
of Iran, continues to send his letters and his messengers to us 
with a view to improving relations and bringing closer 
viewpoints between the two countries, the spiritual leader 'Ali 
Khamene'i surprises us with improper and irresponsible 
statements followed by a frenzied media campaign. Which of the 
two teams should we rely on and which of the two men should we 
deal with? 
  However, we reject and condemn the style used by the Iranian 
media and we also reject the statements made by Mohammad 
Mohammadi Reyshahri [representative of Khamene'i and supervisor 
of Iranian pilgrims] and quoted by the French news agency. We 
warn against the continued use of such a style which does not 
serve Islamic interests and does not achieve any good objective 
in this respect.

  [Text] Dubayy, United Arab Emirates, March 15 (AFP) -- A 
high-ranking Jordanian official is in the United Arab Emirates 
(UAE) on the first such visit since the Gulf war, the official 
UAE news agency WAM reported on Tuesday [15 March]. 
  Parliament speaker Tahir al-Masri met Defence Minister 
Shaykh 
Muhammad Bin-Rashid Al Maktum in Dubayy late Monday to convey 
greetings from King Husayn and Crown Prince Hasan, the agency 
said. 
  They discussed the Middle East peace process and other Arab 
issues, it added without giving further details of the visit or 
saying whether al-Masri would meet President Shaykh Zayid 
Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan. 
  It was the first visit to the UAE by a senior Jordanian 
official since Amman was ostracised by Gulf Arab states for its 
alleged sympathy with the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Jordan 
has denied such support and sought to mend fences with the Gulf 
but has been rebuffed. 
  King Husayn tried to meet King Fahd of Saudi Arabia this 
month during a pilgrimage to Mecca but was shunned. 
  However he has visited Oman and will go to Qatar. The two 
countries are the only members of the six-nation Gulf 
Cooperation Council (GCC) that have not severed ties with Amman.

  [Text] Baghdad, 15 Mar (INA) -- AL-THAWRAH and AL-QADISIYAH 
write that President Saddam Husayn's speech to the Cabinet on 13 
March has ended a period of wily procrastination and 
prevarication and put the onus on the UN Security Council to 
discharge its clear and pressing obligations. 
  AL-THAWRAH says: Iraqis have endured American arrogance and 
tyranny and they have watched while the Americans tried to 
destroy every symbol of civilization in their country, and yet 
they held their ground. 
  Over the past four years, Iraq has handled the unfair UN 
Security Council resolutions with a sense of responsibility and 
commitment, while the UN Special Commission has been shuttling 
back and forth between New York and Baghdad. In the meantime, 
Iraq has had its weapons and factories destroyed, met its 
obligations, and opened its facilities for future inspection, as 
well as acceding to demands that it is certain are unfair. 
Having gone through this bitter, long, and arduous experience, 
the Iraqi people and Government are convinced that the page of 
procrastination and prevarication of the sly fox must be closed. 
Having seen the results of an unprecedented military aggression 
and realized that the Iraqi people are not easy prey, the fox 
has tried prevarication to sap the strength of the Iraqis to 
make it easier to break their will and destroy their sovereignty. 
  The paper adds: Iraq is taking on a conspiracy whose weapons 
are sanctions and no-fly zones imposed under the cover of UN 
resolutions. But thanks to the genius and wisdom of its 
historic leader, Iraq has taken a well-considered stand that 
robs its enemies of all pretexts, especially since Iraq has 
carried out its obligations and shown every cooperation. 
Regional and world developments have exposed America's double 
standard toward Bosnia and the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. In the 
latter case, the United States has been blocking the UN Security 
Council from passing a resolution condemning the massacre. 
  The paper stresses that all peoples and governments, 
including [word indistinct] states, are now facing their basic 
responsibility to address the faults that have been observed in 
the UN Security Council's view and stands since the outburst of 
U.S. tyranny and its adoption of the evils of the new world 
(?order). 
  The paper notes that the use of the UN Security Council and 
the UN flag by the U.S. pirates, who inherited all the evils of 
the old colonialism, not only threatens Iraq's bread and 
sovereignty, but also the sovereignty and dignity of all states 
in the world and all peoples aspiring to achieve sovereignty, 
progress, stability, and the supremacy of justice and fairness 
in international relations. 
  AL-THAWRAH said that what is at stake now is the integrity 
and reputation of the Security Council. The paper stressed that 
the council should uphold justice and fairness and fulfill its 
obligations by ending injustice and lifting the sanctions, or 
else Iraq and its leadership will legitimately choose a new 
road, a road different from the one it has followed for the past 
four years, in terms of its approach to resolutions and 
committees. 
  Iraq has a legitimate and crystal clear demand: An end to 
the sanctions and the no-fly zones by the permanent Security 
Council members, which are required by the council's resolutions 
to ensure Iraq's sovereignty. 
  The paper adds: If the evildoers think that Iraq has no 
other 
options or that it is incapable of rejecting the injustice that 
is concealed under the guise of UN resolutions with colonialist 
interpretations, then they are mistaken. Iraq, with its free 
will, is living in the age of its historic leader, the 
victorious knight Saddam Husayn. The years of al-Qadisiyah and 
the Mother of Battles, as well as the years of the unjust 
blockade, is sufficient evidence that Iraq is capable of 
surviving and that it has never lost its choice of options to 
reach its legitimate, noble goals -- sovereignty, dignity, and 
full rights. 
  AL-QADISIYAH writes: His Excellency President Saddam 
Husayn's speech was open and echoed the soul and conscience of 
the people. It is the last chance for the Security Council to 
lift the sanctions without delay or conditions. 
  The people of Iraq and Saddam Husayn speak with one voice 
and 
endure the same tribulations. Under his mujahid leadership, 
Iraqis vie among themselves to see who will sacrifice the most. 
We have come safely through difficulties and taken off, and 
with the benefit of our leader Saddam Husayn's resolve and the 
brilliance of his strategic intellect, we will stay the course.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "An Iraqi Military Group Announces </F>
the Start of Its Preparations for Overthrowing the Regime"] 
  [Text] London -- Identical reports from the Iraqi 
opposition abroad and Iraqi citizens who arrived in Jordan last 
week confirm that the special Iraqi security organs run by 
President Saddam Husayn's second son Qusayy have arrested a 
number of army officers on suspicion of links with an 
underground military group working to overthrow the Iraqi regime 
which announced itself last January. The sources said that the 
arrest campaign concentrated on the capital Baghdad and on the 
Iraqi town of al-Mawsil in the north. 
  Earlier reports spoke of large-scale arrests, including 
officers on active service as well as retired officers, in 
Baghdad and other towns following the distribution of leaflets 
attacking the Iraqi regime on the occasion of the Iraqi Army's 
73d anniversary on 6 January. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has obtained a copy of the first 
communique 
issued then by the "provisional national leadership," which, 
according to Iraqi opposition sources, consists mostly of Iraqi 
Army officers. According to the communique, this group operates 
inside Iraq within the ranks of the Army with the aim of 
overthrowing President Saddam Husayn's regime "and transferring 
the constitutional powers to the Iraqi people and their 
institutions" after a six-month transitional period. 
  The communique declares that "Iraq's giant -- the army -- 
has 
now awakened...to end this tyranny," and that the birth of this 
leadership "marks the beginning of the march for the destruction 
of that germ." 
  An official of an Iraqi opposition group which operates 
abroad and which has received a copy of the communique, says 
that it was distributed in Baghdad, al-Mawsil, and other towns 
and that one of the copies was smuggled out by travelers to 
Jordan. 
  The communique appears to have been drafted in simpler and 
more realistic language than the statements issued usually by 
professional politicians of the Iraqi opposition abroad, and its 
emphasis is on a decisive role by the Iraqi Army to change 
Saddam Husayn's regime. 
  The group in whose name the communique was issued is 
probably 
trying to cause a split within the security and intelligence 
organs and the Republican Guard, which are under the tight 
control of Saddam Husayn and members of his family, after the 
failure to secure their support in past coup attempts. 
  The communique appealed to "our brothers and sons in the 
armed forces and internal security forces, including the Army, 
the Republican Guard, the police, the public security forces, 
the intelligence forces, and the special security forces, as 
well as the brothers in the party organizations." It reassured 
them that their lives and rights would be protected. 
  This is the first time that a military group has announced 
itself inside Iraq with the stated aim of changing the regime. 
In the past such statements were issued by small groups of 
officers who managed to escape abroad during the years of the 
Iraq-Iran war, the occupation of Kuwait, and the war which led 
to the liberation of Kuwait. 
  The communique said that the next regime should "steer our 
political and economic courses in a manner suited to our 
capabilities as a Gulf oil state...to build a modern Iraq and 
divert its economic resources to the service of its people not, 
as Saddam did, squander billions and billions of hard currency 
on the purchase and manufacture of arms of mass destruction and 
an arsenal which destroyed Iraq and slaughtered its people and 
which was used to invade Kuwait and threaten the states of the 
region and undermine their security." 
  The communique also said that the aim of the group which 
issued it was to overthrow Saddam Husayn's regime and "transfer 
power to the people so that they would rule themselves through 
their representatives elected by free ballot and in the 
framework of a system of government approved by the people, with 
emphasis on the impartiality of the judiciary and on the rule of 
law...without discrimination between Iraq's nationalities, 
communities, religions, sects, or political or ideological 
trends, with emphasis on the neutrality of the armed forces and 
the internal security forces." It stressed that the 
transitional period during which the group itself would govern 
would not exceed six months. 
  Directly addressing the neighboring states and the 
international community, the "provisional national leadership" 
said in its communique that it would abide by the "UN charter 
and resolutions, the Arab League charter, and international 
conventions." It affirmed that it would "open a new and bright 
era of relations based on mutual respect and interests. We also 
emphasize that we would resolve all border problems permanently 
so as not be preoccupied with them ever again in the future."

  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- An informed Iraqi source 
has stated that the arrest of army officers is still continuing, 
five months after the announcement of the latest abortive 
attempt to overthrow the regime. 
  The source said that the detainees include 8th Division 
Commander Staff Brigadier General Salah al-Juburi and a number 
of middle-ranking officers and retired officers. 
  A system for the control of retired officers has enabled the 
Iraqi Government to impose a procedure on them under which they 
have to report daily and sign the registers at military 
industrialization offices and Olympic Committee offices where 
they have to appear nominally for work every day, and under 
which they are not allowed to leave Baghdad or Iraq. This 
system is supervised by 'Udayy Saddam Husayn, son of the Iraqi 
president, a responsibility previously shared with him by Husayn 
Kamil al-Majid, who has been forced by illness to stay home. 
  Meanwhile, a state of alert continues for the fifth day at 
the entrances to and in the main streets of the capital where 
cars are searched and the identities of passengers and 
pedestrians are checked.

  [Text] The regime continues to be frightened of a possible 
military coup by officers who oppose the hated regime after the 
failure of two coups by senior officers in July and August last 
year. Our informed sources in Baghdad say that tyrant Saddam 
has retired more Army officers, who will be on their way to 
disappearing from the scene forever. The source said that the 
following officers have been retired: 
  1. Brigadier General Baha al-Din Sami; 
  2. Brigadier General Malik al-Juburi from the Republican 
Guard; 
  3. Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Rahman from the second police 
force [al-shurtah al-thaniyah]; 
  4. Colonel Husam 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-'Ubaydi from the 
Republican Guard; 
  5. Staff Colonel Nazim Saddam al-Rubay'i from the 2d Tank 
Battalion. 
  A few days ago, the special security forces launched a 
large-scale arrest campaign among Army officers because the 
criminal regime suspects they had secret contacts with groups 
and cells of officers working to topple the Saddamist regime. 
The campaign concentrated on officers from Baghdad city and the 
Mosul governorate.

  [Text] The Palestinian leadership held a meeting this 
morning, Tuesday 15 March, under the chairmanship of Brother 
Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], the president of the state of 
Palestinian and chairman of the PLO Executive Committee. 
  The leadership was briefed at the meeting on a number of 
contacts that took place during the last few days with the 
envoys of the U.S. Administration, the Russian leadership, the 
Israeli Government, and the Norwegian Government to the 
Palestinian leadership. 
  An authoritative Palestinian source stated that the 
Palestinian stance, which has affirmed the need to take urgent 
and necessary measures to protect the Palestinian people in the 
occupied territories following the massacre of the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque in Hebron, and to take radical steps to uproot Israeli 
terrorism, was reiterated to the envoys. 
  The source added that the PLO, while reiterating its 
commitment to the peace process and its aims, would like to 
stress the need for urgent action in order that such a process 
would regain its dynamism and credibility, and in order to 
create suitable opportunities for making the Declaration of 
Principles, signed between the PLO and the Israeli Government, 
successful as soon as possible. 
  The source added that the contacts and meetings, which were 
held with both the U.S. and Israeli sides, have not produced any 
real progress that will help in overcoming the hurdles facing 
the peace process, because of Israel's determination not to take 
effective and real measures, particularly in Hebron and 
elsewhere, its insistence on only taking a number of superficial 
and routine steps and bypassing the stance of the international 
community, which is being supported by a large part of Israeli 
public opinion, and on the need to take effective measures to 
put an end to the terrorist activities of the Israeli settlers, 
a matter that was also recently boosted by the agreement between 
Rabin and the SHAS Party. 
  The source added that the PLO stressed that the task of the 
peace process was to insure security for all. That was why the 
Palestinian people and all the forces that supported peace in 
the region were doubtful about the seriousness and credibility 
of the process in light of the grave threat to the security of 
the Palestinian people, as a result of the presence of hotbeds 
of Israeli terrorism in the settlement areas in the occupied 
territories, and the lack of international protection for the 
Palestinian people under occupation. 
  The source said that the PLO stressed that it was impossible 
to overlook the Hebron massacre, its causes, effects and 
lessons, and that the Israeli Government, which bore full 
responsibility for the massacre, had encouraged the stepping up 
of campaigns of repression and killing against the sons of our 
people after the massacre, and attempted to ignore the fact that 
the massacre was the outcome of the settlement-based and 
expansionist ideological structures, and was not the action of 
an individual or individuals. 
  The official source stressed that while refusing to divert 
its attention from the core of the matter and the massacre, the 
PLO emphasized its rejection of any pressures and attempts to 
compromise on the implementation of the necessary requirements 
for the protection of the sons of the Palestinian people. 
  The source stressed that while calling on the sons of the 
Palestinian people to consolidate the unity of ranks, the PLO 
affirmed that it would continue to work at all levels to insure 
the security, stability, and protection of the Palestinian 
people in the framework of any move toward achieving a just and 
comprehensive peace. 
  The leadership continues to follow up the situation with all 
the concerned parties and at all levels.

  [Text] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, adviser to Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat, today said that the PLO is still committed to the 
Middle East peace process but wants a clause added to the Oslo 
accords. The new clause would call for the creation of a 
security presence [wujud amni] in the occupied territories and 
for the separation of Jewish settlers and Palestinians in 
sensitive areas. 
  Meanwhile, the PLO attributed the failure of the talks held 
yesterday in Tunisia with Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator on the 
peace process, to Israeli reluctance to take effective measures 
in Hebron and other areas. According to the PLO, Israel only 
took cosmetic measures following last month's massacre in 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the </F>
Palestinian delegation to the Taba talks, in Cairo, by Sa'id 
Mu'addi in the studio, from the "With the Events" program 
-- live] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil: Good evening, and many happy 
returns. 
  [Sha'th] Good evening sir, and many happy returns. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil: Did the Israeli-Palestinian 
negotiations reach a stalemate after the failure of the Tunis 
negotiations? 
  [Sha'th] In fact, the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron 
is still casting dark shadows on the peace process. In fact, 
overcoming this crisis requires much effort and a true sense of 
responsibility toward the Palestinian people's security in the 
occupied territories. What is required is not just a security 
Council resolution, but measures to enable the Palestinian 
people to enjoy true security, so the peace process can produce 
the results we all planned for and which we were about to see 
just two days before the massacre. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil: Do you believe Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin's visit to Washington will result in the resumption of 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in the future? 
  [Sha'th] We are waiting to see the results of that visit. We 
believe Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is the one who can decide 
that Israel will solve the present problems. However, we will 
wait to see the results of that visit. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil: Are the channels of communication 
between the PLO leadership and Israeli officials still open, or 
are they still closed? 
  [Sha'th] There was an Israeli delegation in Tunis a few days 
ago to hold talks with the PLO leadership. Before that, there 
was another delegation here in Cairo. I do not believe the 
problem lies with the channels of communication. Such channels 
of communication in our world and in this age are not a problem, 
since the peace process is still going on. The problem lies in 
the absence of a decision to solve the problems facing us. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil: Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said the 
PLO attaches great importance to the Security Council's 
resolutions and noted that previous Security Council resolutions 
were not effective. 
  [Sha'th] The UN resolutions issued during the Cold War were 
frozen, due to differences between the big powers and their 
allies. The situation now is different. We cannot accuse the 
United Nations of bias toward certain sides. The United States 
enjoys a strong influence in this regard. It is the side that 
can put these resolutions into effect. Therefore, a Security 
Council resolution, like the one that led to the repatriation of 
the deportees, should be effective and should be implemented. 
Otherwise, such resolutions are worthless. We want a 
resolution to ensure true security for the Palestinian people, 
at least until the Palestinian entity is established and the 
Palestinian police are launched. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Thank you very much, and many 
happy returns. 
  [Sha'th] You are welcome, and many happy returns.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO </F>
Information Department, by Faridah al-Shubashi; place and date 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Shubashi] Mr. Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO 
Information Department, following the intensive meetings held by 
PLO in Tunis with the Israeli delegation, the U.S. delegation, 
and the Danish mediator, what is the situation now? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] In fact, these meetings have not achieved any 
positive results. We have not achieved progress on the issues 
we discussed. The U.S. side still seeks to link the issuance of 
a Security Council resolution to an agreement on a date to 
resume the talks. 
  We reiterated that the Security Council resolution will only 
be of value if it ensures practical steps on the ground to 
guarantee international protection for the Palestinian people. 
The issuance of such a resolution is a responsibility 
shouldered by the international community, not a bargaining card 
to resume the talks. Therefore, I can say that no progress was 
achieved in the talks with the United States. Anyhow, the ball 
now is in the U.S. court. The Americans are required to give 
answers regarding the Security Council resolution, which should 
be issued immediately after a delay of approximately three 
weeks, as well as regarding their stand vis- a-vis the provision 
of international protection for the Palestinian people. 
  We believe that the issue of negotiations is not a 
procedural 
matter. We believe that the objective of the talks, in fact the 
whole peace process, is to provide security for the Palestinian 
people and to guarantee their rights. If the security of the 
Palestinian people will continue to be endangered -- as was 
proven by the massacre of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque -- what then is 
the value of the talks and their resumption in this case? 
  Regarding the talks with the Israeli delegation, the 
delegation that came [to Tunis] was not authorized to hold any 
serious discussion. What was conveyed to us was no more than 
formal and secondary decisions issued by Israeli Government and 
about which we heard. Such decisions will not change the 
situation on the ground. The settlements and settlers continued 
to be a source of continuous and daily danger to the life of the 
Palestinian people as well as a source of threat to the peace 
process and to any agreement that might be reached regarding the 
transitional period. 
  The Israelis now know our position very well. The peace 
process is linked with effective measures on the ground, 
foremost of which is ending the settlers' presence in the heart 
of Hebron and in a number of settler centers that represent 
permanent hotbeds of tension and explosion. Measures include 
tackling the issue of the presence of armed settlers, especially 
in Palestinian towns and villages, and providing international 
protection, especially in Hebron where Palestinian security is 
exposed to permanent threats. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Has the Palestinian leadership succeeded in 
presenting all these issues to the U.S. side? Is the U.S. side 
still insisting that the Palestinians are the ones who should 
offer concessions? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] The U.S. side expressed understanding of 
Palestinian demands, but wants talks to resume and wants a date 
for this to be fixed. For our part, we said the Palestinian 
people and all the forces that want the peace process to succeed 
in the region hold the view that the success of any negotiations 
is now linked with practical measures on the ground, sponsored 
by the international community. On the one hand, this is 
international protection, and on the other hand, this is Israel 
shouldering the responsibility to end the armed settler presence 
and the activities of the settlers. Therefore, the the United 
States is looking for formal measures. We are looking for 
substance, so these measures can lead to the successful 
conclusion of resuming negotiations. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Perhaps the United States has monitored the 
overwhelming popular anger in the Arab and Islamic worlds. 
There is also the suspension of talks by Syria, Lebanon, and 
Jordan pending the resolution of this issue, or until the 
Security Council issues a resolution on the Hebron massacre. Do 
you think these factors have had any effect on the developing 
U.S. position? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] In fact, the United States is now facing Arab, 
Islamic, and even Christian indignation on a very large scale in 
our region and the world. The United States is hindering the UN 
Security Council resolution and is trying to use this resolution 
as a bargaining chip for the sake of resuming negotiations. The 
United States does not take the dire conditions in the 
Palestinian territory with any seriousness -- conditions liable 
to explode at any moment. Therefore, the U.S. reaction is not 
commensurate or in line with the serious implications of the 
current situation. Therefore, we hold the United States 
basically responsible for any negative developments that might 
appear in the phase. 
  On the other hand, we now welcome the call to hold a meeting 
of the foreign ministers of the five Arab states concerned with 
the peace process. We hope it will be held within the next few 
days to implement stands among us, especially in light of the 
results of the U.S. position and Israeli intransigence. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Thank you, Mr. Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh. 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by Ashraf al-Faqiyy: "Al-Surani Tells AL-HAYAH: </F>
Resumption of Negotiations Would Lead to PLO's Liquidation"] 
  [Text] Cairo -- An authoritative Egyptian diplomatic source 
yesterday described Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's 
decision declaring the "Kahana Hay" and "Kakh" to be terrorist 
movements as "a step in the right direction but not sufficient 
to provide full protection for the Palestinian people in the 
occupied territories." 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH the source urged the Israeli 
Government to protect the Palestinians and comply with the 
fourth Geneva convention concerning civilians living under 
occupation. The source also stressed "the need to resume the 
peace talks as soon as possible." 
  Meanwhile, PLO Executive Committee member Jamal al-Surani 
has 
attacked Israel, saying that "Rabin's decision concerning Kakh 
and Kahana Hay is no more than the first letter in the 
alphabet." He said that the "real terrorism is the one 
practiced by the Israeli Government itself through the 
continuation of settlement building in the occupied Palestinian 
territories and the racial discrimination policy." 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH he said that Kakh and Kahana 
leaders do not differ much from Begin, Yitzhaq Shamir, Ariel 
Sharon, and Rabin himself. He described them all as "hostile 
settlers and colonialists prompted by their love for 
expansionism." He said that "the Zionist tree is a harmful tree 
that consumes oxygen and releases carbon [dioxide]." 
  Al-Surani pointed out that there are "no justifications for 
so-called peace negotiations. They are merely a waste of time." 
He said: "About 30 months have elapsed since the Madrid 
conference and still nothing has been achieved, and 30 years 
will be spent in vicious circles." 
  He added that "Israel's persistence in building settlements 
and Judaizing Jerusalem is the result of the continued U.S. 
support. The United States is an adversary and a judge at the 
same time. The Palestinians' resumption of these talks would 
lead to the liquidation of the PLO, the sole legitimate 
representative of the Palestinian people." 
  Al-Surani attacked the foundation on which the Madrid 
conference was launched, "because it overlooked Jerusalem, the 
refugees, and the settlements, and there is now nothing over 
which to negotiate." 
  Meanwhile, Palestinian ambassador in Cairo Sa'id Kamal has 
stressed that the PLO will not resume the talks with Israel 
before the Security Council adopts a resolution condemning [the 
Hebron massacre] and before guarantees are offered as regards 
providing full protection for the Palestinian people.

  [Text] The Higher Islamic Council in East Jerusalem has 
called on the Muslim residents of Hebron to boycott the state 
commission of inquiry into the massacre at the Tomb of the 
Patriarchs. The Council rejected cooperation with a 
state-appointed commission on any issue pertaining to the holy 
places. 
  Our Arab affairs correspondent Arye Gus has learned that the 
decision to boycott the Shamgar commission was inspired by 
Jordan, and contravenes the Waqf's initial position in support 
of testifying before the commission. 
  Several days ago, the Hebron Municipality published a 
proclamation calling for the expulsion of the Jewish settlers 
from Hebron, the dismantlement of Qiryat Arba' and the other 
settlements, and the lifting of the closure from the town. The 
Municipality, which was appointed at the time by the Military 
Government, also demands the removal of the Jewish synagogue 
from the Tomb of the Patriarchs and the restoration of the 
site's Islamic nature.

<F P=106> [Article by A. 'Abd-al-Haqq: "Are We Interested in the Fall </F>
of Rabin or in Foiling the Settlement Policy? Palestine Wants 
`Political Revenge,' Not a Bloody One"] 
  [Excerpts] Instinct is the worst guide to useful and 
creative political work; such work needs the ability to apply "a 
bundle of pressure factors" on the adversary to force him into 
accepting the Palestinian reading of the Declaration of 
Principles. 
  The PLO has gradually built up a cumulative position, 
presenting specific demands that create a balance between 
pushing the peace process onto a more serious course and giving 
the necessary response to the angry popular reaction to the 
Hebron massacre as dictated by its duty and role as a 
representative of the Palestinians. [passage omitted] 
  It goes without saying that the PLO understands Washington's 
role and influence in the United Nations. But Palestinian 
insistence on a Security Council resolution condemning the 
massacre, calling for an international presence in the occupied 
territories to protect our people, and indicating that Jerusalem 
is part of the occupied territories, as a condition for resuming 
bilateral talks with Israel may lead to some sort of 
confrontation with the United States, as indications have shown 
since the massacre. But the PLO, for its part, realizes that 
the United States has a genuine interest in resuming the 
negotiations as soon as possible, and this is also the position 
of other influential international parties with clearer support 
for our people and cause. Moreover, Israel's position is weak, 
and it is difficult to defend all its components. All these 
factors, consequently, help the PLO achieve better political 
gains that previously offered to it. 
  An effort for a political achievement does not necessarily 
require confrontation. That is why the PLO accepted, as 
President 'Arafat said a few hours after the massacre, U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's invitation to 'Arafat and to the 
Israeli prime minister to resume the bilateral talks in 
Washington as soon as possible. American intervention in the 
talks, indeed, had been a Palestinian demand for months, and it 
is not right to abandon it when opportunity knocks. The 
conditions for taking up the invitation must be satisfied, 
basically by the government of Yitzhaq Rabin doing what it must 
do vis-a-vis the tragedy. [passage omitted] 
  PLO's hardline position, and the fact that the organization 
did not immediately respond to exaggerated suggestions that time 
is not on the side of the Palestinian position, may be in order. 
But we must understand and realize the fact that these two 
factors have limits, and that it is inevitable for the PLO to 
return to the negotiating table. The PLO is not in the business 
of a revenge governed by instant angry reactions, but is seeking 
a political achievement that may return things to the right 
track and make up for our loss in the negotiations in Davos and 
Cairo, with a view toward adopting the Palestinian reading of 
the joint Declaration of Principles.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Brothers, Arab opposition groups that operate from 
one Arab capital against another usually operate from the 
capital of an opposition country. This opposition is usually an 
agent of the host country and not a democratic opposition. This 
type of opposition is not effective. On the contrary, it may 
benefit the party the opposition has targeted by exposing this 
party's enemies. The most effective opposition is a free 
opposition that neither belongs to another country nor works 
under its instructions. Such opposition is motivated by 
ideological or nationalist objectives. 
  Today, brother leader Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] faces 
opposition of both types. While we hear a great deal about the 
opposition of the 10 factions in Damascus, as well as that of 
others, I have always sensed that opposition by the Palestinian 
intellectuals abroad is by far more effective than any of the 
opposition groups that cannot refute charges of agentry. 
Perhaps Professor Edward Said is the best example of effective 
opposition. The man, who greatly contributed to the PLO winning 
respect in the seventies and eighties, now stands against 
brother leader Abu-'Ammar and his aides and calls for changes in 
the Palestinian command. Professor Said has found many 
sympathetic ears in the East and the West, and in the Arab 
countries because his opposition, which is based on ideas and 
interpretations of policies, cannot be a subject of the 
accusation that face the minor Palestinian factions, whose 
presence is only felt because they have an office in an Arab 
country. 
  Opposition is a right to be exercised by those who have 
different viewpoints. However, this does not necessarily 
justify the opposition of certain Palestinian intellectuals just 
because they cannot be accused of agentry and subservience. 
Although opposition is necessary to show that the Palestinian 
political course is a democratic course, I believe that the cons 
of this opposition by far exceed the pros. 
  One of its positive aspects of opposition is its shock 
value. 
It forces the Palestinian command to realize that there are 
people watching and holding it to account, that if it commits a 
mistake, it cannot hide this fact from the Palestinian people. 
Thus, the command works more carefully and more accurately. 
Another positive aspect is that the Palestinian opposition 
facilitates brother leader Abu-'Ammar's dealing with the West, 
including the United States. He can cite the pressure that is 
being brought to bear on him and the opposition he faces during 
the negotiations to decline offering gratuitous concessions and 
to call for removing obstacles on the road to an agreement so 
that he may offer the Palestinians what satisfies them. 
  On the other side, we find that the following factors work 
against the opposition: 
  1. Brother Abu-'Ammar and his partners have maintained the 
flame of the Palestinian revolution for more than a quarter 
century. At the end, this has led to the Declaration of 
Principles and to negotiations that could end with real autonomy 
rule followed by an independent state. 
  2. If the agreement is bad and the negotiations are bad, the 
Palestinians in the occupied territories will have their say 
when the elections that are scheduled for this year are held. 
Mr. Yasir 'Arafat, president of the state of Palestine, and his 
colleagues have a right to resort to ballot boxes after their 
protracted struggle. 
  3. The acceptance of the agreement and the negotiations have 
come in the wake of pressure from the East and the West, and 
from the Arab countries themselves. Had the PLO persevered in 
its refusal, the Palestinian cause would have been lost for good 
over the years in light of the realities Israel is creating and 
the refusal of the international community to bring pressure to 
bear on Israel to force it to change its stand. 
  4. This is the most important point. None of the opponents 
have an alternative. In practice, there is no alternative to 
the PLO command. Edward Said himself wrote in both AL-HAYAH, 
[word indistinct] and THE NEW YORK TIMES that alternatives are 
not dropping from trees and that capable people are just 
appearing when there is a void. 
  While the opponents should fully enjoy their right to 
oppose, 
the fourth point suffices to defend Abu-'Ammar and his partners 
and to reaffirm that it is impermissible to think for one moment 
of toppling a command for which there is no substitute and then 
wait for the emergence of an effective command. We could end up 
with a command that will make us truly regret losing the one we 
have.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Improper U.S. Pressure"] </F>
  [Text] The pressure being exerted by the United States on 
the PLO by linking the expected UN Security Council resolution 
on the massacre at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque with the 
resumption of the talks arouses dismay and amazement. By 
adopting this position, the United States, which is supposed to 
play the role of "honest broker" in the peace process, is 
playing the role of a party that is biased in favor of Israel. 
It is this role which so far has delayed the Security Council's 
approval of a resolution on a horrible massacre on which the 
entire world has commented. Nothing justifies all this 
procrastination or the delay in adopting this resolution. 
  Moreover, this U.S. stance enhances the conviction about 
dual 
U.S. approaches and positions regarding issues of international 
legitimacy and international law. It seems this time too, as in 
previous times, that when talk is over resolutions in the 
Security Council against the Arab nation or against any Arab 
state, the United States promotes such resolutions in no time. 
However, when talk is over resolutions in favor of the Arab 
nation on the basis of international legitimacy and 
international law, the United States immediately begins raising 
conditions and formulas and involves the Security Council in 
endless foot-dragging. It goes so far as to hint using its veto. 
  Of course, news agency reports about Washington's objection 
to referring to Jerusalem as part of the occupied territories, 
and the reservations and conditions which it is voicing 
regarding the issue of international protection affirm that 
Washington adopts the Israeli position and tries to evade 
international resolutions because of this bias. 
  Such positions, with which the United States continues to 
deal with Arab issues, affirm the "honest broker" role's lack of 
credibility and disqualifies the United States from fulfilling 
such a role as long as it continues to pursue a policy of bias 
and double standards and evades international resolutions 
relating to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. 
  In conclusion, if the United States is really concerned 
about 
the peace process in this region and interested in the 
resumption of a serious and genuine peace process, it should 
stop pressuring the party that is the victim in the equation and 
stop alluding to the "U.S. veto" against international 
legitimacy's resolutions. It should pursue the same standards 
in dealing with the various issues on the international arena. 
Without such an approach, it is a grave mistake to believe that 
the continuation of the present U.S. position might promote the 
peace process.

<F P=106> [Station commentary: "Israel Cannot Be Both--Enemy and </F>
Arbiter"] 
  [Text] O brothers, O sons of our great militant people, O 
sons of our glorious Arab nation: The UN Security Council's 
debates, which began following the big massacre and terrible 
crime committed by the Zionists at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque, 
have continued day after day and week after week. What is 
required from the UN Security Council is neither strange nor 
abnormal. What is required is only a resolution in harmony with 
its previous resolutions. What is required is a resolution 
entrenching the objective for which the Security Council and the 
international organization were established. What is required 
is a resolution condemning the massacre, defining international 
protective measures so that the massacre will not be repeated, 
and demanding the disarming of the settlers who came to our land 
to commit massacres. 
  However, days and weeks have passed since the massacre, and 
no such resolution has been issued. Why? Because the United 
States is exerting pressure to prevent such a resolution. The 
United States believes there is no need for resolutions because 
Israel alone can take such measures, can protect the 
Palestinians from itself, and can put pressure on its settlers 
to hold their terrorism at bay. Efforts are being exerted to 
issue such a resolution by the permanent members of the Security 
Council, such as Russia, France, Britain, and China, as well as 
by many European, Arab, Islamic, and African countries. 
However, the United States, the most powerful country in the 
world -- which speaks day and night about human rights, 
international legitimacy, and sponsoring the peace process -- is 
resisting this desire for justice by the international community 
and insists on its support for, bias toward, and collusion with 
Israel; that is, in favor of terrorism, crime, and massacre. 
  If we scrutinize the U.S. stand we will find the United 
States saying to us: Israel is the enemy and the arbiter; 
Israel is the killer and the savior. This is strange and 
abnormal logic that runs counter to justice and history. It is 
logic that pours salt in the wounds and makes those with faith 
in peace question their faith. This logic destroys the 
foundations of the peace process. If this happens, the 
Palestinians are not the only losers. All parties, including 
Israel and the protector of its terrorism, the United States, 
will also lose. 
  Does power and force blind people to this extent? Will 
Israel continue to commit crimes and seek the protection of the 
United States?

  [Text] The Polisario Front has rejected options A and C of 
the report of the UN secretary-general presented yesterday to 
the UN Security Council to break the deadlock in the peace 
process in Western Sahara. The first option -- option A -- 
concerns the organization of a referendum of self-determination 
next December without taking into account the reservations 
voiced by the Polisario Front. The third option -- option C -- 
is the pure and simple withdrawal of the UN. This, according to 
sources close to the Polisario, marks the failure of the United 
Nations and can only lead to the escalation of the conflict and 
war. As for option B, it envisages the continuation of 
negotiations as from 30 June in an attempt to secure the 
agreement of the two parties -- that is, Morocco and the 
Polisario -- on the criteria of identification of electors 
illegible to vote. The Polisario Front voiced reservations on 
these options [A and C] as explained by the ambassador of 
Western Sahara to Algiers: 
  [Begin recording] [Ambassador] The Saharans think that these 
options need to be amended, that is the commission of 
identification of voters should be linked to the so-called 
compromise proposed by Butrus Butrus-Ghali. We think that this 
compromise is the formulation of the concessions made by our 
side. The UN Security Council should thus take into account the 
reservations voiced by the Polisario Front, included in the 
memorandum addressed to the UN special representative on 25 
February. [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa today said that the 
Middle East peace process will be in great peril unless Israel 
changes its attitude to Jewish settlers and takes bold steps to 
ensure the safety of Palestinians. 
  The foreign minister told REUTER that it is in the interest 
of all nations participating and interested in the Middle East 
negotiations to ensure that incidents similar to the Hebron 
massacre will never occur again. 
  Minister Musa said that Israel should abandon its current 
policy concerning settlers and settlements. Israel should also 
revise its security policy to provide protection for the 2 
million Palestinians who live under occupation, for those 
Palestinians are its responsibility, Musa pointed out. 
  The foreign minister said that Israel should abandon the 
policy that Israeli Army forces refrain from confronting armed 
settlers attacking Palestinians in the occupied territories. It 
is in everyone's interest that negotiations resume, but only 
once it is clear that measures, not yet taken, are in place to 
protect the Palestinians and deal with the settlers and 
settlements. 
  Minister Musa said that a UN Security Council resolution 
calling for an international presence to protect the 
Palestinians would not only pave the way for the resumption of 
talks between the PLO and Israel, but also breath life into the 
stalled Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Jordanian talks.

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Muwaffaq Zaydan: "`Great Escape' in Algeria </F>
Topples Military Commanders"] 
  [Excerpts] Algiers, Peshawar, AL-HAYAH -- Well-informed 
sources in Algiers told AL-HAYAH yesterday that an operation at 
the Tazoult prison (400 km southeast of the capital) which 
resulted in the escape of more than 1,000 prisoners, among them 
a large number of members from the armed Islamic groups, has 
toppled a number of military commanders, reportedly including 
security director Mohamed Tolba. And while President Liamine 
Zeroual has stressed his determination to continue the "serious 
dialogue," it has been learned that General Khaled Nezzar, 
former member of the ruling Higher State Council [HSC], has 
returned to Algeria from Switzerland to supervise the 
presidency's course. And signs of a campaign the authorities 
intend to launch against the National Liberation Front [FLN] 
have emerged. [passage omitted] 
  In a statement, a copy of which AL-HAYAH received in 
Peshawar 
(Pakistan), the Armed Islamic Group claimed responsibility for 
the operation. It said that it had carried out the attack 
"after months of planning and training." And that this proves 
the group's "ability -- with Almighty God's help -- to strike 
wherever and whenever it wants, God willing." 
  It also said that "the daring operation resulted in the 
freeing of about 1,000 prisoners among them more than 400 
mujahidin sentenced to life imprisonment or death." [passage 
omitted] 
  In the statement the group claimed responsibility for 
murdering Abdelkadir Alloul, commander of the operations zone in 
Oran. 
  In a separate statement, a copy of which AL-HAYAH has 
received, the "amir" of the Armed Islamic Front (eastern 
district) attacked some Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] leaders 
like Kamal Boukhadra and Mohamed Karar, criticizing their recent 
statements that armed action would be suspended if the 
authorities offer certain concessions. He also attacked Cheikhs 
Abdallah Jaballah (Ennahda movement) and Mahfoud Nahnah (HAMAS) 
and other advocates of dialogue. [passage omitted] 
  It has been learned that military officials will be removed 
from their posts as a result of the jailbreak operation. More 
than one source has confirmed to AL-HAYAH that Security Director 
Tolba has resigned and that General Bachin [as transliterated] 
(former military security director) is a candidate for the 
security minister's post. Maj. Gen. Zeroual received Bachin 
some time ago. 
  Well-informed sources have stressed to AL-HAYAH that their 
information indicates that an "all-out confrontation" between 
the authorities and the armed groups is not ruled out. The 
sources pointed out that the authorities are "under pressure" to 
adopt this option, of which Maj. Gen. Zeroual does not seem to 
approve, as he stressed in a speech addressed to the Algerian 
people on the occasion of 'Id al-Fitr his determination to 
continue the "serious dialogue" with anyone that respects the 
Constitution. [passage omitted] 
  AL-HAYAH has learned that unknown elements sneaked into the 
residences of five ministers and a former wali in al-Sunubar 
Club (northwest of the capital) and managed -- despite the tight 
security -- to enter their homes and leave threatening messages 
and a warning in the form of a slaughtered or suffocated animal 
(cat) inside the ministers' bedrooms. 
  Meanwhile, AL-HAYAH has learned from sources close to the 
Interior Ministry that a plan is being prepared to hit the FLN, 
because it has not cooperated with the government. And it has 
been reported that some Algerian wilayas have begun to announce 
their breakaway from the FLN and urge "loyalty" to the state. 
  Some sources expect the campaign against the FLN to be 
represented in the expulsion of about 400 employees belonging to 
the FLN from their posts in government institutions. 
  At another level, information -- almost corroborated -- says 
that the HSC is still in power. And that it is still in control 
of the keys to power, and that Fadhil Saidi, architect of the 
HSC, who mediated between Gen. Khaled Nezzar and Gen. Liamine 
Zeroual, is still an influential party to the power 
"appointments." The information says that he was behind Ahmed 
Yahya's appointment as director of the president's office, and 
that he is now making new nominations. 
  The information says that Khaled Nezzar has returned from 
Swtizerland to run the "presidency" closely, and that Ali Kafi, 
former HSC chairman, has not yet moved out of his residence and 
has gone back to lead the "Veterans Organization." Tidjani 
Haddam, member of the council, has become President Liamine 
Zeroual's "envoy." As for Ali Haroun, he is conducting his 
"business" from Paris. Redha Malek, member of the council and 
prime minister, maintains that political stability is 
represented in his government's remaining in power.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "After Kashmir, the Pressler Amendment -- That </F>
Fond Hope Also Dashed"] 
  [Text] The United States has excluded Pakistan and 
Afghanistan from the list of countries which will receive 
international development aid in 1995. Robin Raphel, the under 
secretary of state and chief of the Clinton administration's 
committee on South Asia and the Pacific, told the House of 
Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee that aid to Pakistan 
was suspended under the Pressler Amendment. The Pressler 
Amendment has been helpful in slowing down Pakistan's nuclear 
program. After assuming office, the present government gave the 
nation good news that it would not only bring Pakistan out of 
the isolation resulting from the wrong policies of the previous 
government, but that it would also improve Pakistan-U.S. 
relations to such a level that it would lead to the annulment of 
the Pressler Amendment and resumption of U.S. aid to Pakistan. 
Stories about world support on the Kashmir issue and further 
revision in the Pressler Amendment by the United States, 
especially Pakistan's exclusion from it, could be heard in those 
days. But all the fond hopes are now evaporating one by one and 
it is becoming clear to the people that what they witnessed was 
a dream and what they heard was merely a story. 
  At first, the UN General Assembly was approached about the 
Kashmir issue and the government declared that once again they 
were raising the issue at the world body. A resolution was also 
presented about which the opposition claims that it was planned 
during the Nawaz Sharif government and it had also secured the 
support of most of the friendly countries as a result of 
lobbying by the previous government. But suddenly, the present 
government announced the withdrawal of the resolution and the 
people were told that it had been done due to the insistence of 
"friends" and their reported assurances. It was also said that 
those friends had assured that they would exert pressure on 
India and ensure that the Kashmir issue is resolved through 
negotiations. Naturally, the whole nation's attention was 
focused on the Pakistan-India talks in the first week of 
January. However, the talks remained unproductive and India not 
only repeated its old claim that Kashmir is an integral part of 
India, but also belied hopes of normalizing relations between 
the two countries by embarking on a major operation against 
Kashmiris in Sopor. The siege of the Hazratbal shrine also 
continued. 
  The government then adopted the policy of raising the 
Kashmir 
issue at the UN Human Rights Commission and the prime minister 
said that she would herself go and raise the issue at the UN 
body. Well, she did so and tried to convince the nation that 
India would face a defeat at the global forum and it would 
eventually lead to an end to Indian atrocities in occupied 
Kashmir and that India would be forced to resolve the Kashmir 
issue. 
  An impression was also created that the United States was 
backing the present government and it was putting pressure on 
India. In an attempt to satisfy the United States, the prime 
minister also announced that Pakistan does not help the Sikhs. 
Despite all this, the latest resolution was also withdrawn, 
thereby belying the government's claim that Pakistan is no 
longer an isolated country like before. 
  Whatever happened in Geneva is nothing but a clear 
manifestation of the failure of Pakistan's foreign policy. It 
has also been proven that not only did we fail to appease the 
United States, but we also deprived ourselves of the warm 
relationships we enjoyed with our traditional friends. India 
has now declared that it will not allow ambassadors of Islamic 
countries to visit Kashmir. The stand taken by the United States 
and European countries on this occasion is very obvious. 
  The Pressler Amendment is a discriminatory law against 
Pakistan as a result of which U.S. aid to Pakistan has remained 
suspended since 1990. The previous government paid no attention 
to improving relations with the United States or securing aid. 
The previous government, by launching the self-reliance 
program, created an impression that it did not need U.S. aid. 
However, the present government is quite active in this regard 
and it has been saying that restoration of warm relations with 
the United States will be its major and historic achievement. 
Propaganda was also launched about the withdrawal of the 
Pressler Amendment. But the sweet dream has now vanished. 
Because not only is the amendment still in place in its 
original form and aid to Pakistan for 1995 stopped, but the 
Clinton administration has also indirectly praised the 
amendment. Robin Raphel said that the amendment has helped 
bridle Pakistan's nuclear program. It seems that the talk of 
warmth in Pakistan-U.S. relations was only fiction and we as a 
nation were involved in self-deception in hoping that the new 
government and its leader are capable of taming the United 
States. Reports say that her proposed U.S. visit has also run 
into trouble and expectations from the United States are not 
likely to be fulfilled. 
  Given the situation, the government instead of keeping its 
eyes closed like an ostrich should pay attention to overhauling 
the country's foreign policy and make fresh initiatives for 
creating a consensus between the government and the opposition 
on major issues. It should also do away with mistakes which have 
been causing successive failures. 
  We have tried every means to appease the United States and 
put ourselves under its patronage only to find out that no 
encouraging response has been forthcoming from the other side. 
We are gradually losing the love and affection of our 
defendable friends due to our efforts to appease the United 
States. Our national dignity has also been injured due to our 
policy and it has also stalled our forward movement toward the 
goal of self-reliance. Therefore, instead of wasting any 
further time, the government should take the opposition along 
and devise a comprehensive strategy. It is not wise to keep 
trying that which has already been tried. No one was surprised 
at the U.S. behavior, but we are still being overwhelmed by 
absurd optimism, or at least pretending to be.

  [Text] His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan met Croatian 
President Franjo Tudjman after he arrived in Zagreb on a brief 
visit. Besides his meeting with the Croatian leader, Prince 
Hasan will inspect the Jordanian United Nations peacekeeping 
force in the former Yugoslav Republic, which has recently been 
beefed up. 
  The commander of the Jordanian UN contingent, who is also a 
head of the UN peacekeeping mission, Ghazi al-Tayyib, and senior 
officers received the crown prince. 
  His royal highness is accompanied by His Royal Highness 
Prince 'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn and Minister of State for Foreign 
Affairs Talal al-Hasan. 
  The Crown Prince told reporters he was glad to have a second 
opportunity to discuss with Tudjman efforts aimed at peace in 
former Yugoslavia: 
  [Begin Hasan recording, in progress]...discussed with 
President Tudjman at the gracious reception the ongoing 
developments in the region. I would like to say how gratified 
we are to see progress in the ongoing talks in Vienna. We are 
deeply interested in the concept of a bicommunal community as a 
first step leading to further cooperation between Croatia and 
the Bosnian Muslims. And I certainly would like to say that the 
containment of violence is very much the role to which, we, 
through the United Nations, have committed ourselves to. [end 
recording] 
  Prince Hasan also met the UN secretary general's personal 
representative in former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, and 
discussed the UN peacekeeping operation. 
  The crown prince left Amman earlier in the day on a two-day 
visit and was seen off by senior officials.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] TISHRIN carries an editorial about the Israeli 
prime minister's visit to Washington and the danger facing the 
peace process as a result of Israeli maneuvers. TISHRIN says: 
Observers agree that Rabin's visit has two basic objectives: 
One objective is to paralyze the Security Council so that it 
will not adopt a resolution against Israel dealing with the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and providing protection to the 
defenseless Palestinian people. The other objective is to push 
the United States to pressure the Palestinians in order to 
continue negotiations on a separate agreement that entrenches 
the occupation through settlement building for at least five 
more years. 
  TISHRIN stresses that the peace process is in danger and 
that 
there is no alternative to an effective international and U.S. 
move end the impasse. The paper believes that the peace process 
cannot be rescued by pressuring the Palestinians to implement 
the Oslo agreement because the Palestinian people have wholly 
rejected the agreement. Indeed, the peace process can only be 
rescued by pressuring Israel to return to the bases of the 
Madrid conference, to move toward a just and comprehensive 
peace, to discuss the issue of settlements, to evacuate the 
settlers from the occupied territories, and to remove this daily 
threat to the Palestinian people. 
  TISHRIN continues, saying: The peace process was supposed to 
achieve tangible progress after the Geneva summit. However, the 
peace process has retreated. This poses legitimate questions 
about an honest and constructive U.S. role. Why hasn't 
Washington put the necessary pressure on the rulers of Israel in 
order to implement the Security Council resolutions? Especially 
since it is these rulers who prevented the desired progress and 
are responsible for encouraging Zionist settlers to perpetrate 
barbaric massacres, the continuation of which will certainly 
destroy the peace process. 
  TISHRIN concludes by saying: Many thought that the 
al-Asad-Clinton summit in Geneva would give a strong push to the 
peace process, especially since Syria has adhered to all the 
requirements of the peace process and to achieving a just, 
comprehensive, and firm peace in the region. However, Rabin's 
government was not only satisfied with deadlocking the 
Washington bilateral talks. Indeed, it sought to single out the 
Palestinian side and impose the Oslo agreement. Then it 
surprised everyone with the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre to show 
that Zionism had not changed any of its methods or essence and 
that Zionism and aggression are two sides of the same coin. 
  AL-BA'TH also devotes its editorial to Rabin's visit to 
Washington. Paper says that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin's visit and his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton 
are aimed at justifying the Hebron massacre and holding others 
responsible for the lack of progress in the peace process and, 
hence, gaining more political, financial, and military aid. The 
paper notes that this visit comes after the Hebron massacre, 
which was proven to have been executed in arrangement with 
Rabin's government. 
  Although Israel is fully convinced that Washington will not 
allow the Security Council to adopt any resolution that disturbs 
Tel Aviv. Rabin's government wants more than this from the U.S. 
Administration. It is clear that Israel wants the United States 
to help it avoid all possible effects the Hebron massacre could 
have on Israel. 
  AL-BA'TH continues, saying: If the Tel Aviv government was 
seeking to achieve peace, it would have at least responded to 
the requirements of the peace process by taking at least one 
step in the right direction. During the peace talks that 
started in Washington more than two and a half years ago, it 
became clear that Israel does not want the peace desired by the 
rest of the world. Instead, Israel is seeking to achieve its 
interests in the region. Hence, it is continuously avoiding 
every proposal that could serve the peace process and its 
objective. 
  AL-BA'TH says: Israel is circumventing every proposal 
presented during the peace process by raising side issues that 
have nothing to do with the essence and that do not serve the 
peace process whatsoever. This is clearly evident in Israel's 
avoidance of an announcement of its commitment to the principle 
of withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. 
  AL-BA'TH believes that the peace process, which is suspended 
because of the Israeli stand, requires a more decisive role by 
the cosponsors of the peace process, especially from the United 
States because it has well-known influence on Tel Aviv -- the 
party seeking to derail the peace process. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: It is time for the United 
States to force Israel to face reality, not to overwhelm it with 
more political support and military and financial aid. This is 
especially true since achieving a real just and comprehensive 
peace is supposed to have become even more important.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Unipolar Economics"] </F>
  [Text] With the resurrection of US law Super 301 last week, 
President Bi11 Clinton has earned the distinction of being the 
most "garrulous salesman" of American auto parts, life 
insurance, and telecommunications. The Democratic President has 
decided to woo big business away from the traditional Republican 
camp by acquiring the legal power to wage trade retaliation on 
its behalf. The immediate objective is to bring Japan to heel. 
But judging by the clarification issued by the administration 
that the intention is to issue a "symbolic rather than a real 
threat", Washington is in no hurry to risk a trade war with a 
nation that can say no. It is clear that given the prevailing 
mood in Japan, where the Morihiro Hosokawa Government is under 
severe political pressure to stand its ground, the outrageous 
American demand for handing over a predetermined share of the 
domestic market, will have to be toned down. Even so, the 
"symbolic threat" is significant. It seeks to pin down Japan to 
bilateral trade negotiations, and abjure redressal from the 
multilateral GATT dispute settlement mechanism. In a unipolar 
world, not just Japan, no nation dare demur: Washington has 
clarified that Super 30l has not been revived for trade 
retaliation against any one country which means it can be 
directed against any country the US chooses to. 
  The lone voice of protest against Clinton's megalomania has 
come from Peter Sutherland, the director-general of GATT. But he 
has phlegmatically pointed merely to the "risk" to 
multilateralism when actually it is being aborted. True, the 
powerful European Commission is opposed to bilateralism. But 
Brussels wants trilateralism. This means carving the Japanese 
market between Europe and the US. Why, for instance, should 
Motorola Inc. of US alone get the whole of the foreign share of 
the telecommunications market of Japan? What about Ericsson of 
Sweden? Europe is riding piggyback on the US. Japan is asked to 
make its telecommunications technology compatible with those the 
US and European companies have developed, including some nearing 
obsolescence. But no one talks of America and Europe making 
their technologies compatible with Japanese ones. Compatibility 
has a cost: who should bear it, the exporter, wanting a market, 
or the importer? The American-European gang-up is ominous for 
countries like India. 
  In December last year, the developing countries fell in line 
with the iniquitous Dunkel draft in order to ensure 
multilateralism and free trade. In less than three months, the 
rich countries are racing to carve up the world in a manner 
reminiscent of the colonial powers of the 19th century. What is 
on is not merely a war among the giants. The US is having second 
thoughts on the 10-year MFA [multi-fiber agreement] agreement on 
textiles. It proposes to auction import quotas for textiles 
(from India and others) to American firms. This is nothing short 
of an import duty on textiles. With GATT in hibernation, bully 
Clinton is unstoppable.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin by </F>
Pierre Rousselin in Jerusalem; date not given: "Going Back on 
Oslo Would Be `a Very Serious Mistake'" -- first paragraph is LE 
FIGARO introduction] 
  [Text] Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin was one 
of the principal architects of the Oslo agreement. He explained 
to our correspondent in Jerusalem why Israel refuses to make any 
concessions prior to reopening negotiations with the PLO. 
  [Rousselin] What condition set by the PLO are you ready to 
satisfy to ensure the reopening of negotiations? 
  [Beilin] We cannot talk of preconditions. We have taken 
steps to deal with the settlers. These are not concessions with 
regard to the PLO but the result of internal discussions. It is 
a serious mistake to impose preconditions for the reopening of 
negotiations. That simply slows down the process whereas we 
should be accelerating it to conclude a deal as soon as possible. 
  [Rousselin] The Oslo agreements did not cover the problem 
that is being posed today, namely protection for the 
Palestinians... 
  [Beilin] No, that has been considered very seriously and 
they 
will have their own police force. That is the best way for them 
to protect themselves. That can be implemented very quickly. 
  [Rousselin] Would not an international presence contribute 
to 
Palestinian security? 
  [Beilin] Such a presence would not have avoided the 
massacre. 
We can avoid that sort of thing as long as we are present. The 
Palestinians will be able to avoid it when they have their own 
police force. However, I admit that the issue of an 
international presence is still open to discussion. 
  [Rousselin] The Gaza and Jericho agreement does not settle 
the problem of Hebron... 
  [Beilin] Would an international presence settle the problem? 
  [Rousselin] I do not know. Maybe if the settlers were 
disarmed or moved...? 
  [Beilin] The most important thing is not to take a settler's 
pistol away from him. For 26 years we considered that we had to 
protect the Israeli people in the territories from the 
Palestinians. That was not totally crazy because they were 
constantly threatened by the Palestinians. We must now deal 
with the opposite situation. It is an upheaval in our way of 
looking at things. It was so clear that it was the Palestinians 
who had to be searched at the entrance to the Tomb of the 
Patriarchs! That will not occur again. 
  [Rousselin] Since you have changed your way of looking at 
things, why not now negotiate provisions for the security of the 
Palestinians as you did in Cairo for the security of the 
settlers? 
  [Beilin] We must discuss the details of how the agreements 
signed will be implemented. That can be done in just a few 
weeks. However, that does not require a new general agreement 
such as the one concluded in Cairo. 
  [Rousselin] How can you justify the continued presence of 
settlers in the heart of Hebron? 
  [Beilin] We have to distinguish between the wisdom of having 
founded this type of settlement in Hebron, and the question of 
whether we should change the current situation. Expelling the 
settlers would be very difficult legally speaking. We would 
have to justify our actions before the Supreme Court. If they 
have committed crimes, they will be dealt with by the judicial 
system. If they are innocent, we will be asked why they are 
being evacuated. Having said that, I was personally against any 
cohabitation in the territories from day one. 
  [Rousselin] You admit that the presence of settlers in 
Hebron 
is a mistake yet you refuse to correct this mistake under the 
pretext of not making concessions to the PLO... 
  [Beilin] It is a "fait accompli..." The PLO agreed with us 
in Oslo that we would not move a single settler. To go back on 
an agreement that was a major step forward for our two peoples 
would be the gravest error we could ever make. The cost would 
be enormous. It took us a year to get as far as Oslo... 
  [Rousselin] Could you not amend the signed agreements? 
  [Beilin] Rightly or wrongly, we agreed in Oslo not to move a 
single settler. I understand the criticisms which they (the 
leaders of the PLO) are being subjected to. I understand their 
isolation and bitterness. However, if it means taking a step 
backward, then it is not acceptable. I understand that they 
want to know what we are doing. 
  [Rousselin] So you are ready to discuss it? 
  [Beilin] We will explain to them the measures we have taken 
on our own initiative and not as a result of discussions with 
them. We understand their pain and their anger. Naturally, we 
are prepared to talk about it, not as an obstacle blocking the 
path to an agreement but to explain to them that we are taking 
steps as the ruling authority in the territories. 
  [Rousselin] Why will you not consider redeployment outside 
of 
the Arab-populated zones like Hebron, as planned for July on the 
eve of the elections in the territories? 
  [Beilin] This redeployment will only come if there are 
elections. The agreement is very clear on that point and, as 
you know, the Palestinians are not in full agreement where the 
elections are concerned.

  [Text] Baghdad, 15 Mar (INA)--Foreign Minister Muhammad 
Sa'id al-Sahhaf has asserted that the position of the 
international community at the UN Security Council [UNSC] has 
clearly tilted in Iraq's favor. 
  In an interview with Iraqi television aired tonight, the 
minister added that most UNSC members have actually begun to 
call for the implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687, 
and that their consciences are now burdened by the Iraqi 
people's sufferings, which are caused by the continued 
enforcement of the criminal and unfair embargo. 
  The minister maintained that Iraq is bound to emerge 
victorious, noting that the Iraqi people's patience is 
matchless, because they have held out in the face of the most 
ferocious onslaught in history. 
  The minister went on to say: Since inspection teams started 
their work, there has been full compliance with the unfair 
resolutions passed against Iraq. 
  The minister wondered how many paragraphs of the unfair 
resolutions passed against Iraq have violated its sovereignty 
and independence, how many violations Iraq has suffered, and who 
drew up the parallels that encroach upon Iraq's national 
sovereignty. 
  Al-Sahhaf noted that the game of the handling of Resolution 
687 has become clearer, not only to politicians, but also to all 
citizens, and to all observers who take an interest in this 
matter, which is in violation of all UN conventions and 
international laws. 
  The minister said: Resolution 687 was passed on 3 April 1991 
after it was submitted to the UNSC by the arch-leaders of 
colonialism. Sixteen drafts of this resolution were made. 
After that, new amendments and changes were introduced into it. 
Only then was it put to a vote. Twelve members of the UNSC 
voted in favor of the resolution. Cuba voted against it, 
because it is a courageous and audacious country. Two 
nonpermanent members of the UNSC, Ecuador and Yemen, abstained. 
  Certain countries, such as China, voted in its favor, but 
explained their positions, criticizing several paragraphs of 
this resolution. 
  The foreign minister added: This resolution consists of an 
introduction and 34 operative paragraphs. It is lengthy and 
complicated. Its operative paragraphs were deliberately divided 
into nine sections, the pivotal points are in Section C, which 
was addressed by leader President Saddam Husayn in his valuable 
speech the day before yesterday. On 3 April 1991, the 
resolution was passed. On 6 April 1991 Iraq informed the UNSC 
of its frank and clear stand on the resolution in a lengthy and 
refined message grounded in the rules of international law and 
the UN Charter. Iraq addressed all these paragraphs in 
accordance with the rules of international law. It explained 
how these paragraphs violate the rules of international law. At 
the end of the message, and this is an important thing that I 
must mention, Iraq, through then Foreign Minister Ahmad Husayn, 
said "while noting these principled, legal, and legitimate 
remarks, Iraq urges conscientious members of the international 
community and the public to see the facts as they are, and to 
vindicate justice as appropriate. Given all of the above, Iraq 
has no choice but to accept this resolution." We demanded that 
this message be circulated as a UNSC document. The request was 
fulfilled. 
  The minister went on to say: The purpose was to confirm our 
legal and legitimate rights, which are grounded in the UN 
Charter and the rules of international law, so that these rights 
could not be mistaken, even though we accepted this resolution 
under the circumstances. The second remark I would like to 
make, which is an extremely important one, is the following: 
Line 3 of the preamble of Resolution 687 stipulates that all 
member states are committed to safeguarding Iraq's sovereignty, 
territorial integrity, and political independence. The authors 
of this resolution violated the basic concepts enshrined in this 
sentence in several paragraphs of the same resolution. Several 
paragraphs of the said resolution conflict with these basic 
concepts, which are cherished by the international community. 
  Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf noted that this remark should be 
made so that we may understand the facts pertaining to the 
unfair and sweeping embargo clamped on Iraq. 
  Al-Sahhaf added: Resolution 661 of 6 August 1990 explained 
why this unfair embargo was imposed. It said that the embargo 
was imposed because Iraq had not accepted Resolution 660 of 2 
August 1990. What about Resolution 660? Resolution 660 
consists of two paragraphs calling upon Iraq to withdraw from 
Kuwait, and urging Kuwait and Iraq to negotiate to resolve their 
problems. It also states that the UNSC welcomes all efforts to 
achieve this, especially the efforts of the Arab League. 
  Al-Sahhaf went on to say: Iraq later accepted all these 
resolutions, including 660, 661, etc. As for the UNSC, it did 
not honor its commitments. Then, they drafted this resolution, 
thus "forgetting about" all their previous resolutions. They 
set new conditions and brought about a new situation that 
exposes the true motives for the aggression against Iraq.

  [Text] Baghdad, 16 Mar (INA)--Two Iraqi newspapers have 
urged the UN Security Council [UNSC] to embark on the process of 
lifting the sanctions clamped on Iraq without delay, 
particularly since Iraq has honored its commitments as enshrined 
in the relevant UNSC resolutions. 
  In an editorial today, the newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH says that 
the United Nations and some other parties have underscored, from 
the outset, that the elimination of Iraq's chemical and 
biological weapons, missiles, and nuclear materiel must be 
followed by lifting the economic sanctions within the context of 
a "package deal." 
  The paper indicates that the "package deal" concept is a 
legal one. The legal aspect of this concept means that there 
are reciprocal commitments between Iraq and the United Nations. 
  The paper goes on to say that using compliance with 
international resolutions as a tactical cover to make Iraq honor 
its commitments without expecting the UNSC to honor its own 
commitments is a dangerous game that undermines the credibility 
of the United Nations, and opens the door for further crises and 
regional and international turmoil. 
  The paper says that those who are concerned about peace, 
security, and rights are required to honor their commitments, 
and to act rapidly to deliver on their agreements. The paper 
warns that Iraq's patience and wisdom in no way means that Iraq 
will allow the infliction of further destruction and harm on its 
people. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH adds: The United Nations and those standing 
behind it must understand that peoples have the right to defend 
themselves, their destinies, and their interests with all 
available means when the avenues of hope before them are blocked. 
  The paper addresses the current U.S. position, which is 
grounded in exposed political motives and objectives. It also 
touches upon the UN position, as explained by Rolf Ekeus, 
chairman of the UN Special Commission, which seeks to perpetuate 
the embargo even after its legal justifications have been 
removed. 
  In contrast, the paper notes some positive international and 
regional changes that have surfaced over the past four months, 
developments that have signaled that it is high time the embargo 
clamped on Iraq was lifted, either partially or entirely. 
  The paper emphasizes that the Iraqi people have observed 
that 
the overwhelming majority of nations are now demonstrating an 
understanding of their positions and of their reasoning after 
years of misunderstanding. It goes on to say that while the 
Iraqi people appreciate these stands, they are also capable of 
changing the current equations, based on their legitimate right 
to a free and decent living. 
  Concluding its editorial, AL-JUMHURIYAH wonders: Will 
Washington understand all this and retreat? Or is it determined 
to persist with its criminal acts against the Iraqi people, 
something that would herald new and dangerous political 
developments in the region, and the world? 
  The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH urges the UNSC to honor its 
commitments, as the dictates of fairness and justice require, 
particularly since Iraq has complied with all relevant UNSC 
resolutions. If they do not see any hope for removing the 
injustice meted out against them, our people will have no choice 
but to decide, along with their leadership, on the means to 
create other hope, the paper adds. 
  In an analysis today, the paper asserts that Iraqis have the 
right to choose the kind of life they want to lead, to resist 
the embargo with all possible legitimate means, and to 
demonstrate inventiveness with regard to the form and content of 
this resistance when they find that hopes for a positive UNSC 
move are tightly blocked. 
  The paper criticizes the United Nations' failure to honor 
its 
commitments toward Iraq as enshrined in UNSC resolutions, noting 
that Iraq has demonstrated exemplary commitment and a high sense 
of responsibility in its dealings with the world body, which 
professes to be an advocate of fairness, justice, and human 
rights, to help cope with this or that hurdle in the hope that 
the UNSC members will rise to the required level of humanitarian 
and historical responsibility. 
  For its part, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH blames this failure 
on 
the United States and Zionism, contending that they have 
conspired against Iraq and prevented the UNSC from playing the 
honest role of lifting the sanctions imposed on Iraq. 
  The paper adds: The aggressiveness of both the West and 
Zionism has nothing to do with the events unleashed on 2 August 
1990. Rather, it is connected with Iraq's special and effective 
role, and with the pan-Arab and unity-orientated principles it 
cherishes. Similarly, it has something to do with the scientific 
and technological accomplishments Iraq has made -- 
accomplishments that have broken the myth of Israel's 
superiority in the region. 
  The paper adds: The prime objective of the United States and 
Zionism is to weaken Iraq's military and economic capabilities 
and halt its creative potential.

  [Text] Tunis, 16 Mar (MENA)--MENA's Tunis correspondent has 
learned that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat has turned down 
a U.S. proposal to meet Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres 
in Cairo or Alexandria before the UN Security Council issues a 
resolution about the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and Israel 
declares that it will implement it, especially in connection 
with providing security for the Palestinians in the occupied 
territories and dismantling the settlements. 
  'Arafat also turned down a proposal by Dennis Ross, the U.S. 
coordinator for the Middle East peace process, for a meeting 
between Rabin [as received] and PLO Executive Committee member 
Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] or another Palestinian official. 
'Arafat said the PLO cannot return to the negotiations unless 
its demands pertaining to international protection and the 
settlements are met. 
  'Arafat asked Ross to provide a mechanism to implement the 
Security Council resolution if it is adopted but Ross told him 
Israel would never accept anything like that. 'Arafat also 
requested international forces in Hebron alongside a Palestinian 
force. He also demanded that the settlements in the city be 
dismantled. 
  A senior Palestinian source revealed that Ross brought no 
new U.S. proposals to his two meetings with 'Arafat in Tunis two 
days ago and that he asked 'Arafat to accept the proposals 
included in Warren Christopher's message dated last Thursday in 
which Christopher suggested that the PLO should return to the 
negotiating table with Israel so that a Security Council 
resolution could be issued. 
  Ross insisted that 'Arafat should issue a signed acceptance 
of Christopher's message so that the United States could agree 
to submit the draft Security Council resolution to a vote and 
not veto it. 'Arafat turned down this demand, which was viewed 
as part of the U.S. pressure on the PLO. 
  Christopher suggested in his letter that the negotiations 
between the PLO and Israel be resumed according to a timetable 
beginning last Monday [14 March] with a meeting between 
Abu-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], head of the PLO Economic Department, 
and Uri Savir, director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, 
to be followed by a meeting in Washington between Abu-Mazin 
[Mahmud 'Abbas] and Shim'on Peres, and finally a meeting between 
'Arafat and Rabin in Cairo. 
  The Palestinian leadership expressed dismay at the 
threatening content of Christopher's message to 'Arafat, the 
call to return to the negotiating table in Washington in 
response to President Clinton's invitation, and Christopher's 
insistence that the PLO should make a declaration about resuming 
the negotiations with Israel before a Security Council 
resolution is adopted. 
  The Palestinian leadership also expressed dismay at 
Christopher's request to 'Arafat not to make any new demands 
during the negotiations and not to allow any other party, 
"meaning Russia," to intervene in the peace process either by 
making proposals or submitting new initiatives. 
  The Palestinian leadership described the U.S. attitude as 
"totally biased" toward Israel, even worse than the Israeli 
attitude. 
  'Arafat told Ross that the negotiations could not be resumed 
because of the widespread popular anger in the occupied 
territories unless a Security Council resolution was adopted 
providing protection for the Palestinians living under 
occupation, disarming the settlers, and supplying U.S. and 
Israeli guarantees for this purpose. 
  The Israeli delegation that met 'Arafat and included Rabin's 
adviser Jacques Neriya; Uri Savir, the Israeli Foreign 
Ministry's director general; and Uzi Dayan, director of planning 
at the Israeli Defense Ministry submitted no new proposals or 
positions. 
  The delegation members told 'Arafat that they were not 
authorized to adopt any stance or make any proposal and that 
their mission was only to listen to him and to the views of the 
Palestinian leadership on how to resume the peace process. 
  The delegation informed 'Arafat of the Israeli Government's 
decision to outlaw the extremist Kakh and Kahana Hay movements 
and to disarm some settlers in settlements where extremists are 
found. They also informed him of Israel's acceptance of the 
deployment of unarmed international observers outside Gaza and 
Jericho and its decision to expedite its withdrawal from Gaza 
and Jericho. 
  A senior Palestinian source revealed that had it not been 
for 
the Hebron massacre, 'Arafat and Rabin would have signed the 
final agreement on implementing the Palestinian-Israeli 
Declaration of Principles in Cairo on 10 March. 
  The source added that the Cairo and Taba negotiations on the 
crossing points, the Palestinian police, and the autonomy 
administration were already over and drafts of the final 
agreement had been drawn up. The massacre ruined everything and 
made even the Declaration of Principles subject to total failure.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice president </F>
and secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, in Aden, by 
Fawzi al-Jundi, in Cairo, from the "Dialogue From Afar" program; 
recorded--date not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Jundi] 'Ali Salim al-Bid: The Voice of the 
Arabs is pleased to welcome you. 
  [Al-Bid] Thank you and greetings to you and the entire Arab 
world. 
  [Al-Jundi] Let us begin this dialogue with developments in 
Yemen. We will start with the ongoing efforts to contain the 
Yemeni crisis and consolidate Yemen's unity. You recently 
visited Egypt and several fraternal Arab states. President 'Ali 
Salih also came to Egypt. The Yemeni president and the vice 
president are constantly in touch with President Mubarak. Could 
you tell us about the effect of the current Egyptian efforts to 
contain the Yemeni crisis? 
  [Al-Bid] Our contacts with Egypt fall within the context of 
the historic ties linking the Egyptian and Yemeni people. It is 
no surprise that Egypt shows an interest in Arab affairs, 
particularly in Yemen. It has been Egypt's custom to stand with 
us in the most difficult circumstances. When we run into 
difficulties, the first one we turn to is Egypt and its great 
people. Our contacts with brother Husni Mubarak have been 
fruitful. There was interest in the issue and we exchanged 
views on the Yemeni, Arab, and Islamic issues. The current 
circumstances in Yemen, where the unity march is stumbling, 
naturally necessitate the holding of contacts with the Arab 
brothers, chief among them Arab Egypt, along with our brothers 
in Jordan, Oman, the Arab League, and all the people who love 
good. We believe the contacts are necessary because the issue of 
Yemen's unity deserves attention, since it is closely connected 
with our Arab system and our unionist and democratic goal, God 
willing. 
  [Al-Jundi] Following the signing of the Document of Pledge 
and Agreement in Amman a few weeks ago, there was a sense of 
optimism that the Yemeni crisis could be resolved. But the 
ceremony was followed by clashes between military units from the 
country's north and south. You returned to the commercial 
capital, Aden, and the crisis continued. 
  [Al-Bid] We believe the solution lies in the Document of 
Pledge and Agreement, which is a national document that gained 
national consensus and provided ways out of this crisis. 
Immediately after the document was signed, we should have 
started the implementation and executive measures. But there 
are people who do not want this. The events of 21 February, a 
few hours after the document was signed in Amman, and events of 
26 and 27 February are the product of those who reject the 
document and the Arab consensus. These people do not want 
stability for Yemen or the region. But there is a popular, 
peaceful, and democratic movement that demands the 
implementation of this document. We will side with this 
movement and with the democratic and peaceful struggle to put 
the document into effect, God willing. 
  [Al-Jundi] Some officials in the Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP] have proposed a federation in Yemen, which prompted many 
observers to accuse the YSP of seeking secession and separation. 
  [Al-Bid] We hear many such remarks and rumors. In the 
circumstances and in view of the people's interest and haste, 
some like to make several statements. The drive for unity is 
stumbling mainly due to our failure to establish a state of 
unity, a state of law and order and institutions. There are 
numerous interpretations in this regard and they all seek a 
solution to the main topic, namely, the state of unity. The 
problem is not about unity, but about the state of the unity, 
the mechanism applied in this state, and the definition of the 
state. It is about whether it will be a simple or compound 
state and whether it will be a state that accommodates the 
changes created by unity, the democratic system, and the 
peaceful and democratic struggle and that makes room for 
competition and variation in views in several areas in Yemen. 
So this is the difficult situation we are trying to remedy. I 
believe the Document of Pledge and Agreement has touched on this 
issue. This document sought to build a modern state in Yemen. 
Thus, the discussion on the state of unity is a good thing and 
is needed, I believe. We must not hesitate to listen to every 
view. These views produced the document that we all signed, 
which dealt with the state of unity. It gives a new shape to 
the state of unity and represents a new social contract in the 
state of unity. So the faltering march of unity is due to the 
absence of the state of unity. We should not fear discussion of 
such topics; we should allow dialogue to take place and listen 
to all the views as long as the intention is to build the state 
of unity and find the mechanism that could make room for its 
progress. 
  [Al-Jundi] Is the situation after the signing of the Amman 
document much different from what it was before it was signed, 
at least practically speaking? 
  [Al-Bid] It is fraught with tension, which is what we 
expected, because there is a refusal to implement the document. 
We expected that some would be unable to honor the agreement, 
particularly with regard to the first clause, namely, the need 
to adopt measures against outlaws and the perpetrators of 
terrorism, bombings, assassinations, and every act that disturbs 
security and stability in Yemen. This clause is the stumbling 
bloc. Another clause is the need to provide security and 
constitutional guarantees for the implementation of the 
document. So this situation is the reason for the tension. 
Some people are reluctant to implement the agreement. They do 
not want to be exposed to the public, whose opinion is natural, 
of course. I expect the dialogue committee, the public here, 
all the peaceloving people, and the majority of the people who 
are committed to the implementation of the document to proceed 
with it, God willing, and we will overcome the difficulties. 
Narrowing the alternatives for those who are tampering with the 
situation will place them in a position to accept the 
implementation of the document. We have no choice but to 
proceed with its implementation. The current circumstances are 
the result of the refusal by some people and commitment by 
others to implement the document. We welcome every effort at 
home and abroad and all the efforts exerted by the Arab 
brothers. I believe Yemen will be fine as long as there are 
people at home and abroad who take an interest in it and show 
concern for it. God willing, things will be fine. 
  [Al-Jundi] Thank you very much. 
  [Al-Bid] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Statement by an "official source" at the Standing Committee </F>
of the General People's Congress--date not given] 
  [Text] We, in the General People's Congress [GPC], and all 
the honest sons of our Yemeni people and all their good unionist 
nationalist forces, have believed that the final signing of the 
pledge and accord document in the Jordanian capital, Amman, on 
10 Ramadan [20 February], marked an end to the crisis based on 
the text of the document, to the effect that the signing of the 
document means an end to the crisis. We have also believed that 
settling the crisis can only be achieved by turning a new leaf 
of national accord, forgetting the past along with all its 
negative points, and restoring cohesion to the Constitutional 
institutions in the capital of the state of unity in order to 
begin the implementation of the clause and provisions of the 
document in accordance with the timetable and the mechanisms of 
implementation included in the document. 
  Regrettably, as all the masses of our people know, we were 
surprised that our brothers in the leadership of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP], only few hours after the signing of the 
document, began to escalate the crisis, militarily, and 
politically. The military escalation was represented by suspect 
military moves by the members dominating the YSP leadership 
toward lofty Abyan Governorate without any justification. 
Citizens in Abyan were also attacked, particularly in Mudiyah, 
by the forces moved by the YSP from the Aden and Hadhramaut 
governorates to Abyan Governorate. The military attack was only 
stopped by sincere nationalist efforts that led to the joint 
military committee taking an action, in accordance with an 
authorization from the president, the GPC secretary general, and 
the vice president, which was embodied by supervising the return 
of all the military units to their positions which they were at 
before 19 August 1993. The military repercussions abated, and 
the military committee began the implementation of a great part 
of its agenda. 
  The political escalation was represented by the YSP 
leadership's refusal to return to Sanaa to assume their 
responsibilities in order to achieve the cohesion of the 
political leaderships with their various institutions. Instead 
of doing so, they began to carry out divisionist actions, to 
weaken the pledge and accord document, and to circumvent the 
dialogue committee by setting new impossible and unilateral 
conditions, demands, and concepts. 
  Today, we were all surprised by the YSP leaderships adopting 
a new serious course of escalating the crisis politically and 
militarily. The commander of the central axis in Shabwah, along 
with the YSP organization's first secretary, issued a warning to 
the brothers Colonel Dirhim 'Abduh Nu'man, Shabwah governor, and 
Colonel Ahmad 'Ali Muhsin, director of the Shabwah security 
department, to quickly leave their offices in the governorate 
and to return to Sanaa, considering this a party decision, or, 
otherwise, they shall be held responsible for rejecting this 
decision. 
  As the brother governor and the brother director of 
security represented the Constitutional institutions in the 
region and as decisions to appoint and relieve them are usually 
made by these institutions and not by the party, they rejected 
that threat-like warning. On Wednesday morning, the residents 
of the city of 'Ataq, the capital of the governorate, were 
surprised when they saw a column of tanks and armored vehicles 
of units commanded by the renegade and separatist forces in the 
YSP besiege the governor's office, the Security Directorate, and 
the entrances to the city with a group of hireling agents led by 
Ahmad Bin-Farid al-Suraymah. The siege was an attempt to put 
pressure on these officials. 
  While the GPC regrets annoying our people's sons, who are 
still enjoying the blessed 'Id al-Fitr holiday, with this 
disturbing news, it wants to put the people's masses and all its 
political forces in the picture of what is going on so that they 
can see by themselves the complicity of the YSP's separatist 
forces in carrying out the separatist plans. 
  The GPC leaders in Shabwah informed the Military Committee 
of 
this regrettable development and urged it to move quickly to 
lift the siege imposed on the city of 'Ataq, the governor's 
office, and the Security Directorate; to quickly withdraw the 
military units taking part in this escalation; and to punish 
those responsible for sending them. The GPC leadership in 
Shabwah also urged the Military Committee to withdraw the 
military units that are still stationed in Shabwah to their 
original bases in Hadhramaut Governorate and al- Mahrah 
Governorate. 
  The responsible source added: Thus, it is clear that every 
time the crisis approached a detente, the YSP aggravated the 
situation. It has also become clear through the YSP's recent 
behavior that it is planning to get rid of officials who 
represent the Constitutional legitimacy in the eastern and 
southern governorates and to tighten its iron fist on these 
governorates, which have become a stumbling block in the face of 
its separatist plans. 
  We in the GPC condemn this behavior and urge the unionist 
leaders in the YSP to stop these practices, which harm the party 
in its capacity as a principal partner in the unity, as well as 
unity itself. We also warn the adventurous and influential 
leaders in the YSP against continuing their provocations and 
escalations, and we hold them fully responsible for the 
consequences of their separatist behaviors. We urge the masses 
that protest in the various governorates and subdistricts to 
denounce this new escalation by the YSP.

<F P=106> [Report by `Abd-al-'Aziz al-Sadiqi] </F>
  [Text] Abu Dhabi--In spite of the appointment of Ahmad 
Sa'id al-Badi, the UAE [United Arab Emirates] health minister, 
as acting oil minister, succeeding resigning Minister Yusuf 
Bin-'Umayr Bin-Yusuf, the councils and diwans in the UAE have 
not stopped whispering about who will occupy the vacant 
ministerial portfolio. In fact, the speculations have extended 
to a wide-ranging cabinet shuffle or comprehensive change in the 
composition of Vice President and Prime Minister Shaykh Maktum 
Bin-Rashid al-Maktum's government, which has lasted nearly four 
years. 
  With regard to the fact that some consider the appointment 
of al-Badi as acting oil minister to be an indication of the UAE 
leadership's tendency to reduce speculations about the identity 
of the next oil minister, some believe this appointment to be a 
temporary transition formula, while awaiting "the cooking up of 
the new ministerial meal," which will not stop at the doors of 
the Ministry of Oil, but will continue to include a 
comprehensive reshuffle in most of the current Council of 
Ministers. According to what some circles are repeating, the 
change may extend to the Presidency itself, and these circles 
say that it is likely that the current president, Shaykh Maktum 
Bin-Rashid al-Maktum, will vacate his post as vice president and 
ruler of the Emirate of Dubai. 
  If these rumors are true, the most likely candidate to 
succeed Shaykh Maktum in the post of president is Shaykh Hamdan 
Bin-Rashid al-Maktum, the current finance and industry minister 
and the second oldest brother after Shaykh Maktum Bin-Rashid 
al-Maktum. This formula has it that Shaykh Sultan Bin-Zayid Al 
Nuhayyan, the current deputy prime minister of the Council of 
Ministers, will retain his position in the new government, which 
tallies with a tradition of separating the two posts so that the 
one who leads the government is an official from the Emirate of 
Dubai when his deputy is from the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. 
  Informed sources have ruled out the possibility that some of 
the major portfolios will change, among them the defense 
portfolio held by Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Rashid al-Maktum and the 
higher education portfolio held by Shaykh Nuhayyan Bin-Mubarak 
Al Nuhayyan, as well as some others held by shaykhs like the 
Ministry of State for the Supreme Council's Affairs headed by 
Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Saqr al-Qasimi, the Planning Ministry headed 
by Shaykh Humayyid Bin-Rashid al-Mu'alla, and the Ministry of 
Youth and Sports headed by Shaykh Faysal al-Qasimi. 
  Expected changes are in the service ministries, where the 
sources expect Ahmad Sa'id al-Badi from the Health Ministry to 
transfer to the Oil Ministry, at which he is acting. It is 
expected that Ahmad Humayyid al-Tayir, minister of state for 
financial and industrial affairs, will become minister of 
finance and industry, succeeding Shaykh Hamdan Bin-Rashid 
al-Maktum if the latter is appointed president. 
  Among the ministries around which the rumors are circulating 
is the Foreign Ministry--occupied now by Rashid Bin-'Abdallah 
al-Nu'aymi--where some expect Shaykh Hamdan Bin-Zayid Al 
Nuhayyan to become minister in the place of his current post of 
minister of state for foreign affairs, a post which he has held 
for about four years.

  [Excerpt] Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for 
foreign affairs, returned to Amman this evening after 
accompanying His Highness Crown Prince Hasan during his visit to 
Croatia and Bosnia. 
  The minister spoke about His Highness Crown Prince Hasan's 
visit and his meeting with Jordanian troops taking part in the 
UN peace-keeping forces stationed in Croatia and Bosnia. He 
said that the objective of this visit was to hold a series of 
meetings with Croatian and Bosnian leaders and to meet with the 
Jordanian officers, NCOs, and troops taking part in the 
peacekeeping forces in Croatia and Bosnia. The visit was also 
aimed at meeting with the commanders of the UN forces in the 
former Yugoslavia. 
  He said that this visit comes within the framework of 
supporting ongoing international peace efforts and the recent 
agreement reached between the Croatians and Bosnians in Vienna 
aimed at ending the conflict, achieving peace, and closing a 
chapter of history full of tribulations and sufferings. 
  Al-Hasan noted that the visit added a new dimension to the 
credibility of Jordan and its leader His Majesty King Husayn. 
The visit also highlighted the respect the leadership and 
people of these countries have for Jordan and its leader His 
Majesty King Husayn and his effective contribution in support of 
international efforts and the United Nations' role through the 
participation of Jordanian troops. Jordan has the second 
largest contingent, after France, of peace-keeping forces in the 
region. [passage omitted]

Ekeus, chairman of the UN Special Commission. High-level 
diplomatic sources told INA that French Ambassador Jean-Bernard 
Merimee met with the nonaligned states' ambassadors at the UN 
Security Council yesterday afternoon and discussed with them the 
UN Security Council's relations with Iraq. He told the 
ambassadors: Yes, Ekeus is a gentle, diplomatic, and diligent 
person, but, frankly speaking, I say to you that Ekeus must be 
changed as the Special Commission chairman because his actions 
depend on one viewpoint, which is the U.S. viewpoint, without 
taking into consideration the viewpoints of the other states at 
the UN Security Council. 
  The INA correspondent has verified the French Ambassador's 
remarks from other diplomatic sources that took part in 
yesterday's meeting.

  [Text] Irbil, Iraq, March 17, (AFP)--A senior member of the 
Iraqi opposition urged the UN Security Council Thursday to 
extend the sanctions on Iraq, saying Baghdad was far from 
complying with UN resolutions for a lifting of the embargo. 
  Two UN ceasefire resolutions were adopted at the end of the 
Gulf war in February 1991, calling on Iraq to destroy its 
weapons of mass destruction and to allow UN aid organisations 
free access across the country. 
  General Secretary of the main Iraqi opposition alliance 
Iraqi 
National Congress (INC), Dr. Ahmad Shalabi, told AFP: "The 
Iraqi regime is every day further away from implementing 
resolution 688" on allowing UN organisations access to carry aid 
programmes. 
  Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz began a new effort 
Wednesday to persuade the United Nations to lift the oil embargo 
imposed after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
  In talks with French Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee, this 
month's Security Council chairman, 'Aziz called for an end to 
the embargo on Iraq since his country had complied with UN 
resolutions on disarming. 
  Shalabi, speaking from his headquarters in Salah al-Din, 
said 
a proposed option to lift the embargo only in Kurdish-controlled 
northern Iraq would be "problematical." 
  He said any such proposal would "raise strong opposition 
from 
Turkey's side" because of Ankara's continuing conflict with 
Kurds living in southeast Turkey. 
  He added that Turkey was the base for the UN operation 
Provide Comfort set up at the end of the Gulf war in February 
1991 to provide allied air cover for the Kurds in northern Iraq. 
  Kurdish leaders meanwhile said it would be a positive step 
if 
the UN lifted sanctions on northern Iraq. 
  The Security Council is expected to decide Thursday or 
Friday 
to keep the sanctions locked on Iraq, due to its view that 
Baghdad has not met all council resolution requirements, 
diplomats said. 
  Still a majority of the council's 15 members including 
France, China and Russia have asked that the council acknowledge 
Iraqi progress on disarmament, western diplomats said.

  [Text] Baghdad, 17 Mar (INA)--The newspaper AL-QADISIYAH 
maintains that the game of deception and farces spearheaded by 
the U.S. Administration to exterminate nations through killing, 
starvation, and humiliation -- means that have brought about the 
subjugation of the international bodies that are supposed to 
uphold law, values, and norms -- must be halted. 
  In an article today, the paper adds: The world community has 
realized that the malicious colonialist tactics are part of an 
endless game, and that the only thing that can stop this game is 
the determination of peoples who choose their own way to ensure 
their own survival -- not just their physical survival, but the 
survival that epitomizes loftiness, dignity, and continued 
defiance. 
  The paper notes Iraq's declared position on the need to halt 
the farces being led by the U.S. Administration to exterminate 
peoples, saying that international organizations must halt their 
evil approach, shoulder their responsibilities humanely, and 
refrain from submission. These organizations, the paper adds, 
must honor the actual texts that grant peoples the right to live 
in peace and dignity, and safeguard their sovereignty. These 
texts also stipulate that peoples' investments and rights must 
be guaranteed so that their future generations may survive and 
lead a free and decent life. 
  The paper adds: Given these ethical and reasonable tenets 
agreed on by world peoples and enshrined in international laws 
and rules of conduct, the UN Security Council [UNSC] and the 
United Nations do not have any excuse for the perpetuation of 
the embargo against Iraq, particularly since Iraq has 
underscored its commitment to these laws. The UNSC does not 
have any excuse for bending and yielding before the U.S. whip. 
  AL-QADISIYAH goes on to say: The unfair embargo resolution, 
the epitome of falsehood and deception that flouts man's 
dignity, is no longer acceptable to conscientious people. 
  The paper concludes by saying that the statements made by 
His 
Excellency President Saddam Husayn regarding the pursuit of a 
new approach to ensure our own salvation as we deem fit reflect 
the only option we have left. This option is the option of 
faith that will lead to victory, the paper maintains.

<F P=106> [Article by Salah al-Mukhtar: "Iraq Is Here To Stay" ] </F>
  [Text] European thinkers were not wrong in describing the 
United States as "an extension of the European countryside." In 
fact, post-World War II events, especially following the 
Communist landslides, have established that U.S. decisionmakers 
think with the mentality of a European peasant who has migrated 
to a very modern city! 
  This U.S. resemblance is not meant to refer to the positive, 
but rather the negative aspects of rural life, namely, 
backwardness, shallowness, and naiveness in thinking and making 
decisions. Events of the last half a century confirm that U.S. 
foreign policy has been a mixture of excessive barbarity and 
selfishness, miscalculation, shortsightedness, impetuousity, and 
superficiality in thinking and tackling events, contrary to the 
European mentality, whose maturity and cunning is exemplified by 
British policy. 
  Today, U.S. politicians have proved to be no more than 
European peasants in control of a high-tech civilization. So as 
soon as their rival collpased, they danced joyfully and began 
disgorging their evil intentions and criminal plans against all 
of mankind, including their own friends. Perhaps, the U.S. 
attitude toward the blockade on Iraq is the worst stupidity of 
this European peasant, who knows nothing, and so drowns in his 
own ignorance. When he is slapped in the face and made to wake 
up from his stupor and come back to his senses, he becomes 
stubborn again and pursues his own stupidities until his head 
collides with a solid wall and bleeds, then he yells and runs 
away! 
  The United States fled from Indochina in shame, despite all 
its victory promises and barbarity. It was defeated in Lebanon 
by the blowing up of the Marines headquarters, despite all 
Reagan's fiery words. The biggest shame was its defeat before 
Iraq when it failed to block Iraq's policy, course, and 
leadership, despite all the military buildup. As for its defeat 
in Somalia, it was proof of the United States' vulnerability and 
failure to honor its promises. 
  We tell waverer and liar Clinton: Wake up, the blockade is 
being eroded, even on the official level in the world. If you 
do not save the situation and end this blockade, the news will 
come as a painful slap in the face to tell you that Iraq's will 
power is stronger and that Saddam Husayn is here to stay.

<F P=106> ["Standpoint" column: "Clinton, Ignorance, and Zionist </F>
Motives" by 'Isa Isma'il al-'Abbadi] 
  [Text] The U.S. Administration is using the concepts of 
democracy and human rights in a manner that evokes a contempt 
and disdain for all the peoples and nations of the world. 
  These concepts, which are presumed to be humane, are being 
used as a political card to harm peoples' interests and 
influence their independent political decisions and options. 
  U.S. concepts of human rights and national security seem to 
overlook the fact that other world nations also have human 
rights and national security. 
  Since democracy is based on dialogue, how can anyone be 
democratic and talk about democracy when he rejects the 
principle of dialogue and wields the big stick against anyone 
with a different opinion.? 
  In his periodic report to Congress, U.S. President Clinton, 
as misguided by his Zionist advisers, spoke about what he termed 
Iraq's sponsorship of terrorism and violation of human rights. 
He claimed that Iraqi policy is still based on threatening U.S. 
national security and foreign policy which, he says, calls upon 
the United States to continue imposing economic sanctions on 
Iraq. 
  President Clinton seems to purposely ignore the fact that 
there is a clear UN Resolution 687, which Washington forcibly 
obtained from the Security Council, that Iraq has fulfilled all 
its obligations under this resolution, and that it remains for 
the Security Council to immediately implement Clause 22 of this 
resolution by lifting the blockade on Iraq. This is an Iraqi 
right which the Council must recognize under existing 
international laws. 
  Therefore, Clinton's talk about additional conditions when 
the blockade is approaching another review in the Security 
Council this month is not finding receptive ears among most 
council member states, especially the permanent member states, 
whose positions have undergone a clear change after establishing 
that Iraq has indeed fulfilled its obligations under Resolution 
687. 
  It is inconceivable for the U.S. President to adopt stands 
that show clear ignorance of the geopolitical facts of the Arab 
world, the nature of the firm political system in Iraq, and the 
Iraqi people's solidarity with their national leadership. 
  The U.S. President speaks about nonexistent, meaningless 
things which he wants to stick on Iraq. Clinton must 
understand, if he still does not, that talk about terrorism as 
far as Iraq is concerned is meaningless. Everyone knows that 
Iraq is far removed from terrorism, that terrorists are 
completely unknown to it, and that it is not involved in this 
game whose sides have become well known. The game of hostage 
taking and bargaining between the United States and the West on 
the one hand, and certain political sides in the Middle East on 
the other, serves as clear proof of the involvement of the 
United States, the West, and those sides in terrorism and Iraq's 
complete dissociation from it. 
  As for U.S. drum-beating on human rights whenever the 
blockade is approaching another review in the Security Council, 
it has become absolutely disgusting. 
  If a few days ago China has thrown the ball in the U.S. 
court 
by referring to the millions of destitute, hungry Americans who 
are without homes, we in Iraq are proud that even under the 
unfair blockade we share our livelihood with rare equality, 
especially with regard to the distribution of food among 
citizens, which UN agencies have recognized as very fair. 
  If Clinton's ignorant advisers think Iraq will change its 
skin and start begging at the doors of the imperialist 
embassies, as some traitors do, then they are grossly mistaken. 
The United States is called upon to follow an evenhanded policy 
toward Iraq and the Arab homeland. It is not in its interest to 
weaken Iraq as some Clinton advisers suggest. Iraq is an 
important factor for the region's development, progress, 
balance, and stability, just as it is an important factor for 
world peace and security. As for the blockade, it is bound to 
go, whether Clinton likes or not. So, we will wait and see.

  [Text] Cairo, 16 Mar (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
said that the Egyptian role in the Middle East peace process is 
inspired by a strategic outlook where the Palestinian problem, 
which has lasted for too long, should be resolved so that the 
Middle East may enter a new phase. Musa added that a just peace 
should involve Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Arab 
territories and the recognition of the Palestinians' right to 
self-determination. 
  Speaking at a seminar on the "Future of Peace in the Middle 
East," which was held at Cairo University tonight, Musa said 
that the Middle East does not live in isolation from 
fast-breaking developments that have altered the postwar world. 
A new world order is coming into being, although its features 
may remain unclear because it is still in a transitional stage. 
Egyptian diplomacy takes note of these developments, Musa said. 
He added that those who remain isolated will fall behind. 
  The foreign minister mentioned that following the Cold War, 
regional conflicts in Asia, Africa, and Latin America found 
their way to the negotiating table. It was natural that the 
Palestinian issue would move toward a solution with the new 
changes in today's world. 
  Musa declared that Egypt does not impose its views on the 
Palestinians or any other Arab party, but simply offers 
assistance when requested to do so and when it deems that its 
assistance is needed. 
  The foreign minister reiterated Egypt's position on 
Jerusalem; namely, that Jerusalem is part of the occupied Arab 
territories. Egypt, he said, rejects all Israeli measures that 
were implemented with a view to Judaizing Jerusalem or declaring 
it Israel's eternal capital. 
  Musa responded to a recent statement by U.S. President Bill 
Clinton that Washington sees Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The 
foreign minister described this statement as political and 
tactical [siyasi wa taktiki]. If this statement signals a new 
U.S. policy toward Jerusalem, Musa said, then Egypt completely 
differs with Washington about this policy. The foreign minister 
pointed out that the U.S. Embassy in Israel is still in Tel Aviv. 
  Minister Musa said that the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration 
of Principles signed on 13 September 1993, stipulates that the 
issue of Jerusalem is a topic open to negotiations. Jerusalem 
is an open issue and Israel's measures there are invalid and 
illegitimate, Musa declared. 
  The foreign minister voiced dismay over the UN Security 
Council's delay in denouncing the massacre at al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque. Describing the position of the UN Security Council as 
most regrettable, Musa said that a resolution passed more than 
two weeks after the massacre does not have the same force and 
effect of one issued immediately. The role of the Security 
Council is getting shakier by the day. The Security Council is 
losing its effect on and importance for world public opinion and 
is beginning to fall into the trap of double standards, a matter 
which will lead to the erosion of UN credibility, Musa stated. 
  Minister Musa denounced the Israeli settlements in the 
occupied territories as being invalid and illegitimate. The 
Egyptian position following the massacre was not only one of 
condemnation but also of calling for measures to guarantee the 
safety of the Palestinians living in the occupied territories. 
Security is a two-way street and the Israelis should have no 
monopoly on it, Musa stated. 
  The foreign minister said that Egypt is calling for the 
removal of some settlements, the disarmament of settlers, and 
the outlawing of Israeli terrorist organizations. He pointed 
out that Israel already outlawed two of these organizations: 
Kahkh and Kahana Hay. 
  Minister Musa said that such demands will be presented at 
the 
negotiating table once the peace talks are resumed. This 
underlines the need to resume these talks, he stated. Musa said 
that there are only two methods to restore one's rights: either 
war or negotiations. Shouting and calling for the 
discontinuation of negotiations do not produce results, he 
remarked. 
  Concerning the Middle East market, Musa said that this is an 
idea that has only been expressed, not yet implemented. There 
should be no fear of Israel because it is not a major country 
[laysat dawla kubra] in the region, he said. The foreign 
minister said that, regardless of what we may feel about it, 
economic cooperation in the Middle East will be a normal matter 
once a just peace has been achieved. 
  Musa said that Egypt will definitely not provide Israel with 
water from the Nile. Egypt will not sign the treaty on 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons unless Israel signs it, he 
added.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad 'Allam: "Sha'th: We Will Return To </F>
Negotiations If Required Security Is Provided"] 
  [Excerpts] Cairo -- Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to 
the Palestinian president, has reemphasized that "there can be 
no return to the negotiations before the Security Council 
resolution is adopted, not only because it represents 
international legitimacy, but because it should be complied with 
by the two cosponsors of the peace conference, including the 
United States, as an instrument capable of being implemented to 
guarantee better protection for the Palestinian people." 
[passage omitted] 
  While the statements attributed to U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, in which he considered "Jerusalem the unified capital 
of Israel," have provoked Palestinian condemnation, the Foreign 
Ministry believe that these statements "cannot be taken 
seriously, because they were remarks reportedly made by the U.S. 
President at a dinner banquet and did not emanate from him 
personally." 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH a Foreign Ministry source added 
that, if these statements were "a declared official position, 
they would have been dealt with differently." Besides, "the way 
in which they are currently being dealt with is exaggerated." 
  Meanwhile, official sources have denied that Cairo offered 
to 
host a meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin in Egypt. They said: 
"The offer is American." Cairo expressed willingness to host 
the meeting if 'Arafat agrees and believes that it would be 
useful. They said that "'Arafat turned down the offer."

  [Text] Cairo, AL-HAYAH -- The Muslim Brotherhood group in 
Egypt criticized the United States yesterday. A statement 
issued by the group said that "the U.S. President's recent 
statements reflect his continued support for the Zionist enemy's 
racist and settlement policy. Proof of this is the U.S. 
Administration's position at the Security Council and its 
obstruction of merely a statement condemning the ugly massacre 
committed by the Zionist occupation forces, which blessed what 
the Zionist settler had done, namely the murder of 40 
worshipers, and have since themselves killed over 50 people so 
far." 
  The statement said: "The peoples of the Islamic world view 
with great anger the U.S. Administration's position, which 
treats the rights of Muslims in Palestine and holy Jerusalem 
with contempt." The statement urged the Islamic nation "to 
condemn the U.S. position on the Palestinian issue and express 
popular anger at this position, which is totally biased toward 
the Zionist enemy." 
  Concluding the statement, the Muslim Brotherhood group said: 
"We remind the U.S. Administration that its interests are linked 
with the peoples of the Islamic world. It is impossible for the 
current situation to continue as it stands. Ignoring the Arabs' 
and Muslims' rights in Palestine, in particular holy Jerusalem, 
negates the United States' neutrality and possible mediation in 
resolving the Palestinian issue -- which is clearly reflected in 
the current negotiations."

  [Text] An Israeli security delegation will visit Cairo next 
week to discuss Egyptian accusations that Israel is continuing 
its spying on vital installations in Egypt, providing terrorist 
groups with weapons, and exploiting the Israeli Academic Center 
as a cover for spying activities. Israel in return accuses 
Egyptian officials of being behind the assassination of Albert 
Atrakchi, former administrative attache in the Israeli embassy 
in Cairo. It bases this accusation on Egypt's demand for his 
withdrawal before his assassination after accusing him of 
involvement in spying activities against Egypt. 
  The Israeli security delegation's visit will be made under 
the cover of searching for the remains of 19 Israeli officers 
killed during the October war. But the main objective of the 
visit is to discuss the worsening security crisis between Egypt 
and Israel. Israel is demanding the release of four Israeli 
spies arrested in Sinai last year in return for releasing eight 
Egyptians detained in Israeli prisons. One of the important 
Egyptian security organs refuses to release the Israeli spies, 
who were caught with 24 rolls of film of vital installations in 
their possession as well as reports on Egypt's peaceful nuclear 
program and the ministries' buildings, activities, and guards. 
  More than 16 Egyptians in Sinai had reported that the four 
spies had contacted them in an attempt to recruit them. 
  The Egyptian side is also raising the issue of the role of 
six Israeli officers in distributing weapons inside Egypt, 
particularly in Upper Egypt. The six officers are: Mordechai 
'Azar, Benyamin Vataniyu, Ra'ul Farhat, Menahem Raymond, Shoktol 
Avraham, and Soson Musa. All of them are members of the Israeli 
military intelligence service and were helped by two of staff of 
Israel's Cairo embassy to smuggle weapons in diplomatic bags. 
The Egyptian security services monitored 12 contacts between 
these two employees and 35 Egyptian figures; they arrested 22 of 
the latter and seized weapons like those captured with terrorist 
groups. Egyptian authorities have asked for the recall of the 
involved embassy staff. 
  Egypt has also protested a new attempt to continue with the 
same activities by three embassy employees who were recently 
expelled. Israel objected to this expulsion, regarding it as a 
non-cordial act. 
  The talks will also involve the activities of the Israeli 
Academic Center. Egyptian authorities have in their possession 
documents on research and information collected by the center, 
including four documents about the People's Assembly and two 
about the cabinet, in addition to documents and other studies on 
the ministries of defense, interior, education, economy, 
agriculture, industry, and planning. 
  Egyptian security organs' reports noted that diplomatic 
pouches are used to carry information to Tel Aviv. They said 
that six Egyptian researchers who cooperated with the Israeli 
Academic Center gave Egyptian authorities information and 
documents on the center's role and spying activities. 
  While the United States is trying to contain the crisis 
through its Cairo Embassy on the pretext that its escalation 
would marginalize the Egyptian role in the peace process, 
Egyptian authorities are demanding the removal of the director 
of the Israeli Academic Center and an end to Israel's hostile 
activities against Egypt.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Atif al-Ghamri: "The West and Its New Enemy"] </F>
  [Text] The Muslims are coming! 
  This is the expression that is being re-used, with some 
variations, to take the place of the ones that used to dangle in 
front of the public in the West like "commandments" at the peak 
of the Cold War. These expressions used to say that the 
Russians are coming. 
  Although this warning has been spread a little bit here and 
a 
little bit there, what is very noticeable about it is that many 
of its aspects originate from the United States. For example, 
Dan Quayle, the former U.S. vice president, used to speak about 
what he called the danger of extremist Islamic fundamentalism. 
He placed it in the same basket as Nazism and communism. There 
were many articles and analyses written in various papers 
discussing the war of the Muslims against the West. These 
articles used the words terrorism, fundamentalism, and Islam 
interchangeably and synonymously. 
  This is the meaning Professor Bernard Lewis used in a 
lecture 
entitled "Islamic Fundamentalism" in which he reiterated the 
notion of the expected clash between the Islamic and Western 
civilizations. 
  The famous American magazine ATLANTIC dedicated a large 
amount of space to an article headlined "The Roots of Islamic 
Hatred." 
  There is need for reflection when a writer like Professor 
John Esposito, one of the respected intellectuals taking part in 
the activities of Oxford University and the Royal British 
Academy for International Affairs, attacks this trend, which has 
created a general wave of fear of Islam. He recently published 
a book entitled The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality. 
He is renowned for his objective interest in Islamic studies 
and he has numerous earlier publications and studies, including 
his book Islam, the Right Way. 
  In his new and valuable book, he observes a number of 
phenomena in this campaign, which concentrates on what it calls 
the Islamic threats to the West. 
  He notes that there is a great deal of exaggeration, bias, 
and ignorance of reality. He also claims that incitement of 
Western societies toward a danger that is threatening them is 
the method previously used in an exaggerated way with the Soviet 
Union, thus molding it as the evil empire. 
  This policy served the purpose of, and to a certain extent 
justified the allocation of resources to immense military 
expenditure and support for the giant American military 
industries in the United States. 
  This concentration on, and highlighting of the threat, at 
the 
expense of other perspectives of the elements of interaction 
inside the Soviet Union used to lead many of the government's 
agencies and departments, intellectuals, and political studies' 
centers to make the wrong deductions. It destroyed their 
ability to foresee the collapse of the Soviet Union, which had 
already deteriorated internally economically and socially. The 
threats that gripped the West in the pre-Soviet collapse years 
did not depict the reality in its absolute picture. 
  Confronting the campaign on Islamic threats constitutes a 
challenge to whoever accepts such a role, because there are two 
ways to approach the truth about Islam. One of them is the easy 
way: Present Islam as a historic enemy with a doctrine and 
agenda for natural hostility to the West. The difficult 
approach is to move away from ready-made cliches and delve into 
an in-depth analysis of the actual situation. 
  Adopting the second approach provides the evidence for the 
shortcomings of adopting the first approach, because Islam is 
not Khomeyni or al-Qadhdhafi, and those among the Muslim leaders 
who adopt terrorism are not necessarily the ones who portray the 
real Islam. 
  Many of those who now bear the banner of Islam are 
performing 
political actions. Their objective is political. For them, 
Islam is the guaranteed method to attract the largest number of 
people to their ranks because it is the most effective call 
under the current political circumstances where the masses do 
not respond to the calls of political doctrines that recently 
lost their effectiveness. 
  Every one of these leaders expresses a political state that 
evolved within the framework of its particular society and not 
the general Islamic world. 
  Therefore, it is a mistake not to consider each condition 
separately within the boundaries of its historic political, 
social, and psychological components, and to resort to 
generalizations. 
  For example, it is wrong to explain what has happened and is 
happening in Sudan, Lebanon, and Yugoslavia religiously and to 
view it from the perspective of a Christian-Muslim 
confrontation. This view simplifies things drastically and 
reveals the mistakes in making certain deductions because the 
political reason is the initial and prime mover and force behind 
these events. The religious reasons followed later as a natural 
result and not an original component. 
  The same thing emerges from the confrontations and civil war 
in northern Ireland between the Catholics and Protestants. The 
roots of the problem are political more than religious, such as 
ethnic nationalism, autonomy, independence, as well as economic 
and social considerations, but not religious. 
  Esposito has objectively diagnosed the campaign for arousing 
fears from Islam among the public in the West. This campaign 
started directly after the collapse and absence of the Soviet 
enemy and the emergence of a wave to replace it with the Muslim 
enemy. 
  This is a policy governed by wider political reasons. The 
presence of an enemy for some societies such as the United 
States is in some ways an economic necessity because military 
industry prospered during the conflict with the Soviet enemy. 
One of the tools of this conflict was to inflame conflicts and 
civil wars in the Third World. This made these industries 
experience one of their most prosperous ages in production. In 
the years preceding the end of the Cold War in 1989, there were 
around 40 regional conflicts and civil wars taking place in 
Third World countries of which we had a very large share in 
Lebanon, Chad, the Iraqi-Iranian war, and the Gulf War. 
  The presence of an enemy is necessarily followed by 
mobilization, national motivation, supervision of defense 
budgets, production of weapons, and military intervention 
operations abroad. Currently, some of these are intervention in 
Somalia, and previously intervention in the defenseless areas of 
Iraq. Now, the ghost is hovering over Sudan. 
  In addition, the West, the United States in particular, know 
very well that terrorism is not Islam and that the terrorists we 
are complaining about had some official and covert relations 
with the United States. These are facts proven through some 
U.S. documents such as the Central Intelligence Agency's 
cooperation circle in Afghanistan during the eighties with 
Hekmatyar and the group called the Afghan Arabs through funding 
and support. Information was also leaked about coordination in 
joint terrorist activities between the Abu-Nidal group and the 
Israeli intelligence, Mosad. 
  Therefore, the campaign that claims the Muslims are coming 
and that there is going to be a cultural clash and Islamic war 
against the West have their own political reasons. Terrorism is 
not characteristic of Islam, nor is it characteristic of the 
Muslims.

deadlocked since the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron in 
the middle of the month of Ramadan. The request came in a 
message that 'Arafat sent to Clinton. 
  The Palestinian news agency said today the message dealt 
with 
the difficulties blocking a Security Council resolution 
denouncing the massacre and providing international protection 
for the Palestinian people in the occupied territories and their 
holy places. 
  The message also dealt with Israeli maneuvers and lies aimed 
at blocking the implementation of the Declaration of Principles 
and the serious situation in the occupied land.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasir </F>
'Arafat by Hamidah Na'na' in Tunis, published in cooperation 
with Paris-based AL-FAJR; date not given] 
  [Text] [Na'na'] When you agreed to the Gaza-Jericho First 
agreement, most observers viewed your stand as a historical 
gamble. This was confirmed in time with the Hebron massacre, 
which revealed that the issue of settlements, which under the 
Oslo agreement had been postponed, should have been listed as a 
priority issue on the agenda. The issue of Jerusalem also 
emerges as a real obstacle in the UN deliberations. How do you 
assess the status of the Palestinian cause after what happened? 
  ['Arafat] The Hebron massacre has confirmed that they do not 
want to implement what they agreed to in Oslo. This was clear 
when Rabin said that there are no sacrosanct deadlines. This is 
in addition to the influence the Israeli Army has on the 
political leadership. The military does not want to implement 
the Oslo agreement or the Gaza-Jericho First agreement as you 
call it. The Gaza-Jericho First agreement is part of the 
agreement and the agreement is an integrated one comprising a 
preliminary stage to be followed by a final one, and it was 
agreed to call it the Gaza-Jericho agreement because the 
Israelis are supposed to withdraw from Gaza and Jericho first. 
The Oslo agreement covers all the Palestinian territories that 
were occupied in 1967. 
  Here, I would like to clearly point out that the Hebron 
massacre was not a massacre against a group of Palestinians that 
was committed by a Zionist settler. The Hebron massacre is a 
scheme in which Israeli Army units participated. This clearly 
resembles what our brother Algerians faced from the French 
Secret Army Organization [OAS] which sought to obstruct the 
French-Algerian agreements. As Palestinians, we now face the 
same situation in the occupied territories. This only shows 
that the extremist Zionist mentality views the Palestinian Arab 
presence in the occupied territories as a very serious issue. 
From this premise, the withdrawal of the settlers from Hebron 
is essential. We have reached the conclusion that Israel does 
not want to implement the Oslo agreement. It is not the 
Gaza-Jericho First agreement as you call it because the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement is part of a more comprehensive agreement 
made up of two stages; a preliminary one to be followed by a 
final one. First, they are supposed to withdraw from Gaza and 
Jericho and then from all of the occupied Palestinian 
territories that were occupied in 1967. 
  [Na'na'] You referred in previous statements to the 
involvement of Israeli military units in the Hebron massacre. 
Do you mean that there are forces within the Israeli Army that 
do not agree with the behavior of the political leadership and 
that they seek to undermine this leadership's Oslo commitments? 
  ['Arafat] Yes, the Hebron massacre is not an individual 
action, nor an action carried out by a psychopath, as the 
Israelis like to say. The Hebron massacre is part of an ongoing 
scheme in which Israeli Army units participate. This situation 
is exactly like the one our Algerian brothers had faced at the 
hands of the OAS prior to Algeria's independence. They sought 
to obstruct the French-Algerian agreements, the Evian talks, and 
General de Gaulle's commitments. The Palestinian people in the 
occupied territories are now experiencing the same situation. 
These forces have no interest in the establishment of peace, 
what interests them is to continue establishing greater Israel 
on Palestinian land and the land of other Arab countries. 
That's why we should be very alert about the developments. 
  [Na'na'] Was the issue of settlements and the threat they 
pose to the peace process discussed in Oslo? Don't you think 
that this issue should have been a priority, the objective of 
which is to separate the settlers and the Palestinians in order 
to prevent any friction that would place mines in the road of 
the peace process? 
  ['Arafat] The issue of settlements was discussed in Oslo and 
an agreement was reached on several points in this regard. The 
most important points are: 
  First, the building of new settlements is totally 
prohibited. 
  Second, the expansion of current settlements is totally 
prohibited. 
  Third, the confiscation of new territories is totally 
prohibited. 
  The final decision on the fate of the settlements was 
mentioned in the Oslo agreement. The issue of settlements will 
be discussed as soon as possible within a period of no more than 
two years. The formed committees are supposed to start work 
after an agreement is reached on the final stage. We formed a 
committee to discuss the issue of Jerusalem, a committee to 
discuss the issue of refugees, a committee to discuss the issue 
of evacuees, a committee to discuss the issue of settlements and 
settlers, and a committee to discuss the issue of borders. 
  [Na'na'] If the issues contained in the Oslo agreement are 
so clear, then how do you explain the U.S. stand at the UN 
Security Council, which now rejects discussing the Jerusalem 
issue or referring to it as part of the occupied territories, 
which has led to postponing the vote on the agreement many times? 
  ['Arafat] The Security Council is currently discussing a 
resolution that condemns the Hebron massacre and calls on Israel 
to take measures, including the confiscation of settlers' 
weapons to prevent them from carrying out illegitimate acts. 
The text of the resolution will demand measures to protect 
Palestinians through an international presence in the occupied 
territories. Herein lies the differences between the United 
States and us. While the United States talks about the presence 
of international observers in the Palestinian territories, we 
say that the agreement stipulates an international presence in 
Palestinian territories. We demand an immediate international 
presence in the Palestinian territories to protect our people 
and holy places at this difficult time. 
  (The telephone rang and the speaker on the other end was 
Dennis Ross. From the course of the conversation, it seemed 
that there was a new negotiable offer. I heard Mr. Yasir 
'Arafat say to Ross: Wait for a couple of hours and I will come 
after I meet with my comrades in the Executive Committee.) 
  [Na'na'] It has been said that there is a new offer by the 
United States that seeks to expedite the process of withdrawal 
from Gaza and Jericho and expand the Jericho area in return for 
not discussing the issue of Jerusalem in the Security Council 
resolution, accepting civil observers instead of international 
emergency forces, and dismantling a number of settlements and 
evacuating about 500 settlers from Hebron. How true is this? 
  ['Arafat] No. This was not what I just discussed with 
Dennis Ross. It is not currently an issue of Jericho's area, of 
expediting the withdrawal process, or dismantling the 
settlements. It is more serious than that. It is an issue of 
international protection for our people to make them feel safe 
and secure in light of this multilateral conspiracy, involving 
the settlers, members of the Israeli Army, and gangs which call 
themselves organizations such as "Kakh," "Kahane Hay," and other 
such racist organizations. These organizations are proven to be 
financed from New York, specifically Brooklyn, and are being fed 
with weapons, men, and money. 
  The Israeli settlers are carrying out joint patrols with the 
Israeli Army. This a violation of the Oslo agreement. The 
Israeli Government should bridle the settlers because the 
continuation of the current situation will destroy the peace 
process at its roots. 
  [Na'na'] Is it possible to conclude from what you are saying 
that you will not return to the negotiations unless effective 
international presence; that is, military protection, is 
provided for the civilians? 
  ['Arafat] The most important thing to us now is to provide 
an international presence. This should take place through a 
resolution on which the Security Council votes so that it will 
be obligatory to its members and all parties concerned with the 
peace process. Russia and the United State -- the cosponsors of 
the [Madrid] conference -- are supposed to take measures to 
adopt a similar resolution. 
  [Na'na'] What form of international protection do you 
envisage? 
  ['Arafat] A military one, of course. Otherwise, who will 
protect Palestinian civilians from the armed settlers? There 
are international forces in southern Lebanon, on the Golan, and 
in Sinai. Why is it so strange to have international forces in 
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip? It is true that I am not 
asking for guns and tanks. But I am asking for international 
forces that are capable of protecting the civilian inhabitants 
from attacks by the settlers and others. 
  [Na'na'] The Russians have returned in force to the 
international arena after the Hebron massacre and made several 
proposals, such as the need to convene a new international 
conference similar to the Madrid conference on the Middle East 
crisis. Do you believe the Russian proposals could be 
implemented? 
  ['Arafat] We fully welcomed the Russian initiative. We have 
been in constant contact with Russia. I received many envoys 
and finally Foreign Minister Kozyrev. 
  [Na'na'] What about Arab coordination. Do you expect an Arab 
summit in reply to what has taken place? 
  ['Arafat] I wish an Arab summit would convene. However, this 
requires intensive efforts. The Arab state of affairs is 
difficult and complicated. I hope that as Arab leaders we can 
overcome the Gulf crisis so that the new world order will not be 
established at our expense and that of our children. 
  [Na'na'] Within the framework of Arab coordination, have you 
and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan reached an advanced stage of 
political and economic coordination? 
  ['Arafat] Yes, we have made large strides in the field of 
coordination with the Jordanian brothers. We signed an economic 
agreement. We held meetings of the security committee and the 
refugees committee, and meetings of other committees on other 
levels. All this took place in implementation of what we and 
his Majesty King Husayn had agreed during my last visit to 
Jordan after signing the Cairo agreement when I handed King 
Husayn a copy of that agreement. 
  [Na'na'] After the massacre, French Defense Minister 
Francois 
Leotard visited Israel. Does this visit signal a change in the 
French stand? Do you not believe it would have been more 
appropriate for a defense minister of a country that is a friend 
of the Palestinians to have postponed his visit in the wake of 
the Hebron tragedy? 
  ['Arafat] The French stand has not changed. In the United 
Nations, this becomes apparent through the president of the UN 
Security Council, the French representative. The French stand 
is good, solid, sympathetic, and forceful. We had hopes that 
such a visit would not take place at that time so that it might 
not be interpreted as France approving of the massacre and 
supporting the Israeli stand. 
  [Na'na'] President 'Arafat has been a hero in the eyes of 
his 
people. He has been a symbol, and a struggler. However, 
support for you in the occupied territories has been dwindling 
for some time. Of course, you notice from the pictures 
transmitted on television and the information you receive that 
following the Hebron massacre, the people now oppose the Oslo 
agreement and the peace process, and that their support for you 
has greatly diminished. 
  ['Arafat] I have said this more than once. Patience has its 
limits. Everyone, both far and near, should realize this. Our 
people welcomed the peace agreement. But, the Israeli maneuvers 
and Rabin's obstruction of the implementation of the agreement 
have made the peace process lose its credibility in the eyes of 
our people. I do understand the Palestinian people. The world 
at large should also excuse them if they lose their faith in 
peace. Our people suffered two massacres in 15 days. The first 
took place in the Ibrahimi Mosque by armed settlers in collusion 
with the Israeli Army. The second massacre was the one 
committed against our people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip 
where dozens of martyrs fell, many were wounded, and more than 
1,000 were arrested. It is true that they released 1,500 
detainees of those whose prison terms had nearly ended, but they 
arrested 2,000 others. 
  This state of affairs that our Palestinian people has been 
experienced has led, among other things, to their dwindling 
support for the peace process.

  [Text] Commenting on Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres' remarks that Israel accepts taking some measures in 
Hebron after the PLO agrees to return to the negotiations, Faruq 
Qaddumi, the head of the PLO Political Department, has stated 
that the Palestinian leadership does not trust promises by 
Israeli officials. Peres has already made many unfulfilled 
promises. 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH [no date as heard], Qaddumi 
revealed that the Palestinian leadership has rejected an Israeli 
request to hold a meeting between Peres and 'Arafat in 
Washington. 
  Responding to Israeli press reports yesterday that U.S. 
President Bill Clinton wants to announce that Jerusalem is the 
capital of Israel, Qaddumi said: If this happens, we say the 
peace process is over. He added: If this is confirmed, we will 
withdraw from the negotiations, because Washington would be 
violating the basis on which these negotiations were started. 
Qaddumi said he expects things to drag on before the 
negotiations are resumed, because Israel is procrastinating, 
playing for time.

  [Text] Cairo, 16 Mar (MENA)--Palestine National Council 
[PNC] Secretary Muhammad Subayh has denounced U.S. President 
Clinton's recent remarks that Jerusalem is Israel's united 
capital. 
  In an exclusive statement to MENA, Subayh said that such 
remarks contradict every official position espoused by former 
U.S. Presidents and the U.S. commitment to the UN Security 
Council that holy Jerusalem is an occupied territory. 
  He added: The Palestinian people and all the peoples of the 
Islamic nation are astonished and denounce the U.S. President's 
remarks, which come on the heels of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre. These remarks raise fears about U.S. credibility and 
commitment to the peace operation. 
  Subayh noted that these remarks show total bias toward 
Israel, violate international law and UN and Security Council 
resolutions, and provoke the feelings of faithful Muslims and 
Christians worldwide, who can never accept the Judaization of 
this holy city.

  [Text] Cairo, 16 Mar (INA)--Zuhdi al-Qidrah, PLO Executive 
Committee member, has described U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
recent statements on Jerusalem as blatant and unfair U.S. bias 
toward the Zionist entity, and an attempt to strike at the 
Palestine question and confiscate the Palestinian people's 
historic rights. 
  In a statement to an INA correspondent in Cairo, al-Qidrah 
said the PLO and the Arab people have received with extreme 
dissatisfaction Clinton's statements, which do not at all help 
the establishment of a just peace in the region. 
  He added that the Palestinian people do not trust the United 
States at all. He stressed that negotiations with the Zionist 
entity cannot resume under the absolute U.S. bias toward the 
Zionist entity and the UN Security Council's glaring and full 
submissiveness to the United States. 
  He stressed that the PLO cannot resume these negotiations 
unless a clear UN Security Council resolution condemning the 
Zionist massacre in Hebron is issued. 
  Meanwhile, in statements published here today, Mahmud 
'Abbas, 
also known as Abu-Mazin [PLO Executive Committee member], 
criticized Clinton's statements. He said the United States 
should have unhesitatingly condemned the Zionist massacre and 
forced the Zionist entity to abide by international law. 
  Abu-Mazin rejected the U.S. President's statements on 
Jerusalem. He said these statements clearly show that as it 
provides the Zionist entity with support and protection, 
Washington obstructs international efforts to secure the 
issuance of an international resolution through the UN Security 
Council condemning the Hebron massacre. 
  In similar statements, Mrs. Hanan 'Ashrawi, former 
spokeswoman for the Palestinian negotiating delegation, said 
Washington has completely lost its credibility in the eyes of 
the Palestinian and Arab people in general. She stressed that 
Washington seeks to appease the Zionist entity through 
irresponsible statements or through the obstruction of any 
resolution condemning the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
  In her statements, Hanan 'Ashrawi indicated that a feeling 
of 
violent and regrettable shock is prevailing in the occupied Arab 
territories as a result of the recent U.S. statements, which are 
absolutely unacceptable. 
  She said she believes the U.S. Administration is employing 
every means of pressure against the PLO and the Palestinian 
negotiators to push them to offer unilateral concessions. She 
called for reconsidering calculations and positions and avoiding 
contributing to the loss of the Palestine question, which is now 
experiencing its most delicate stages.

  [Text] Cairo, 16 Mar (MENA)--Muhammad Subayh, Palestine 
National Council secretary general, has confirmed that intensive 
consultations are under way to hold a meeting of the five Arab 
countries involved in the Middle East peace process -- Egypt, 
Syria, Jordan, Palestine, and Lebanon -- in Cairo as soon as 
possible on the foreign minister level. 
  He said the aim of this meeting is to coordinate stances on 
resuming the Arab-Israeli peace talks and discuss the effects of 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre on the peace process. 
  In exclusive statements to MENA, Subayh said that Egypt is 
making intensive diplomatic moves with the United States, the 
Palestinians, and the Israelis to find a way out of the deadlock 
that the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations reached following the 
massacre perpetrated by the settlers in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  He noted that Egypt's efforts aim to convince Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to show more flexibility toward the fair 
Palestinian demands to resume the peace negotiations. He noted 
that the Palestinian demands focus on the need to provide 
international protection for the Palestinian people, reduce the 
number of settlements, disarm the settlers, and release the 
Palestinian detainees.

<F P=106> [Report by Ashraf al-Faqiyy: "Sha'th Tells AL-HAYAH: </F>
Palestinians Will Not Pay the Price for the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
Massacre"] 
  [Text] Cairo -- Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, has said that the United 
States has not implemented the pledges it made during his visit 
to Washington at the beginning of the month as regards providing 
protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied 
territories. 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH Sha'th pointed out that delaying 
the adoption of a Security Council resolution on the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre "has created a negative atmosphere." He said 
that "it is unimaginable that the Palestinians should pay the 
price for the Israeli crime." 
  He added that the U.S. Administration's insistence on 
ignoring the Jerusalem issue and delaying the Security Council 
resolution is considered a negative change in the U.S. 
Administration's position. 
  He wondered: "How can the Americans link tackling the 
massacre to excluding Jerusalem from a resolution representing 
international legitimacy?" 
  He pointed out that the Palestinians have not taken any 
decision to pull out of the negotiation process...and that the 
main issue is ways of providing protection for the Palestinian 
people in the occupied territories. 
  He described the measures taken by the Israeli Government 
regarding the Hebron massacre as insufficient. He said: "The 
decision to classify Kakh and Kahana Hay as terrorist 
organizations has not been complied with." Indicative of this, 
he said, is that action has been confined to arresting a few 
people and confiscating 80 rifles, 13 pistols, and two bullets. 
He pointed out that the instructions the Israeli Army had 
received were not to fire on settlers. 
  He added: "The Palestinian leadership is demanding that 
protection be provided, the Palestinian position has not 
changed, and we will not go to the negotiations before minimum 
Palestinian demands are met and practical measures are taken in 
this connection." 
  Sha'th said that numerous scenarios are being discussed in 
Tunis for the resumption of the peace negotiations. He pointed 
out in this context that the contacts made recently in Tunis 
have produced no agreement. The Palestinian leadership is 
waiting to see what practical measures Israel can take after the 
Security Council adopts a resolution on the massacre.

  [Text] Cairo, 15 Mar (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa met 
tonight with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian 
delegation to the peace talks, and Zuhdi al-Qidrah, Fatah 
Movement's representative in Cairo. 
  Dr. Sha'th described the meeting as fruitful and useful. The 
meeting, he added, involved discussion of Palestinian 
developments following the Hebron massacre, the current talks in 
Tunisia, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's visit to the 
United States, ways to break the current deadlock, and security 
guarantees for the Palestinian people. 
  Dr. Sha'th added that he conveyed a message from President 
'Arafat to Foreign Minister Musa. President 'Arafat and Foreign 
Minister Musa also talked on the telephone during the meeting, 
Dr. Sha'th remarked. 
  Concerning the resumption of the peace negotiations, Dr. 
Sha'th said: Certainly there will be no return to negotiations 
before the UN Security Council passes a resolution. The 
significance of such a resolution is not only that it would 
state the opinion of international legitimacy, but that the 
cosponsors of the peace conference, including the United States, 
would be committed to its implementation. Such a resolution 
would be an expression of international resolve in the form of a 
legal instrument, whose implementation should provide the 
Palestinian people with better protection, Sha'th said. 
  The Palestinians are interested in returning to the 
negotiations, Sha'th said, but on the condition that their 
demands for security measures are met. He added: Time is not 
an issue. Had the UN Security Council passed the resolution 
last Friday, as the understanding was, and had Israel introduced 
the required, logical, just, convincing, and justified measures 
last week, we would have resumed the negotiations today. 
  Dr. Sha'th said: We want measures and we want them 
implemented so that we may be able to go back to the negotiating 
table. Israel took such practical measures as banning settlers 
from carrying firearms at al-Aqsa Mosque, the Wailing Wall, and 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque and outlawing terrorist organizations, 
but these measures are inadequate because they fail to meet the 
necessary security requirements, Sha'th declared.

holding consultations with the parties concerned with the Middle 
East peace process as well as with UN Security Council members. 
The subject of the consultations is the holding of a Security 
Council session to discuss the attack against worshipers at the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque and the passing of a resolution condemning 
the massacre. 
  Palestinian Ambassador to Cairo Sa'id Kamal said that 
Minister 'Amr Musa today gave him an urgent message for 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat concerning the consultations 
Egypt is holding on a UN Security Council meeting to denounce 
the massacre. 
  The Palestinian envoy said that the Palestinians are 
unwavering in their call for the condemnation of the atrocity 
committed by the settlers against the Palestinian people and for 
international protection of the Palestinian people living in the 
occupied territories. Ambassador Kamal said that Palestinian 
and Egyptian consultations are continuing to achieve this end.

<F P=106> [Interview with Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political </F>
Department, by Hamidah Na'na' in Tunis--date not given] 
  [Text] [Na'na'] Following the Hebron massacre, the PLO set 
a host of conditions for the resumption of negotiations. What 
are these conditions? Are they sufficient to reassure the 
Palestinian people in the territories about their security and 
restore their confidence in the possibility of attaining peace? 
  [Qaddumi] Following the Hebron al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, 
which was perpetrated by the Israeli settlers, it has become 
essential that protection be provided for our people in the 
occupied territories. The issue of settlements has become an 
urgent topic that should be discussed today and not tomorrow, 
that is, not at the end of the transitional period. Secure 
areas in Jerusalem, Hebron, and Bethlehem, which are the 
friction areas, should have been created. Israel should have 
adopted firm measures to disarm the settlers. We wonder why the 
Israeli Army, which is occupying the Palestinian territories, is 
allowing those settlers to carry weapons if it is not for the 
sake of attacking the Palestinians? It is quite possible to 
disarm them. The Security Council should also issue a 
resolution defining a mechanism according to which the citizens 
can be protected against the settlers' attacks. 
  Israel should expedite its withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho 
first. Postponing withdrawal on the pretext of Israeli security 
is a big lie. They should have withdrawn on the fixed date. 
The international community, which condemned this ugly 
massacre, should support the Palestinian people and protect our 
people in the occupied territories. The [Madrid] conference 
co-sponsors should pressure Israel into adopting the necessary 
measures to protect the Palestinian people. The Security 
Council is still discussing this issue. Regrettably, the United 
States said there is no need for a Security Council resolution 
and that an official statement by the Security Council president 
would be sufficient. But this does not commit the concerned 
parties nor does it serve as a Security Council resolution that 
is binding on those adopting it. 
  [Na'na'] Do you think that the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre 
has endangered the Oslo agreement? 
  [Qaddumi] Yes, this horrendous incident has caused many 
problems and dealt an almost fatal blow to the Oslo agreement. 
Israel, particularly Yitzhaq Rabin, is responsible for that. 
Rabin did not abide by the agreement and tried to exhaust the 
Palestinian negotiators and dictate his own terms and personal 
interpretation of this agreement. This robbed the agreement of 
popular Palestinian support. This was followed by the horrible 
mosque crime, which drove nails in the coffin of the Oslo 
agreement and the negotiations. 
  [Na'na'] How responsible is the United States for this? 
  [Qaddumi] The United States bears direct responsibility. It 
should have taken prompt measures instead of claiming that it, 
as a big power, is protecting human rights and instead of asking 
China to respect these rights. Can't it pressure Israel, which 
it considers more than a friend, into safeguarding human rights? 
Events have proven that Washington erred when it sought to 
scrap the UN resolution equating Zionism with racism. It is now 
clear to the world that we were right when we asked the United 
Nations to issue this resolution. We will ask it to reevaluate 
this resolution. Our people have been exposed to a Palestinian 
"holocaust" by those who say they were slaughtered by Nazism. 
The United States, which claims to be a big power responsible 
for peace and security in our region and the world, should adopt 
the necessary measures to put an end to these serious inhuman 
practices. 
  [Na'na'] You have been in contact with the U.S. 
Administration since the massacre. Dennis Ross is expected to 
visit Tunis before this interview is published, and President 
Clinton's advisers as well as U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher held several contacts with President 'Arafat. 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev also visited Tunis and 
met with the Palestinian leaders. Has a new plan emerged from 
these contacts? 
  [Qaddumi] I would like to point out the fact that the 
current 
U.S. State Department team--Dennis Ross, Martin Indyk, Aaron 
Miller, Dan Kurtzer, and others--sympathize with Israel and are 
trying to blackmail the Palestinian people. However, this time 
they know that they are absolutely incapable of blackmailing us. 
They should shoulder their international responsibilities and 
we appeal to President Clinton to personally shoulder this 
responsibility and impose peace in the region by adopting 
practical measures that protect our people, impose respect for 
human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, and 
pressure Israel into withdrawing from Gaza and Jericho without 
any delay. If Washington really wants to sponsor peace and act 
as a fair arbiter in this process, that is the way they can help 
restore momentum to the political settlement process. 
  [Na'na'] In a telephone conversation between U.S. Secretary 
Christopher and the Palestinian president, the United States 
threatened the Palestinian leadership. What was the response to 
this threat? 
  [Qaddumi] It would take a long time to describe the methods 
the United States is using to impose its conditions on us. At 
the same time, however, we realize that the United States is a 
superpower. This does not hold off the fact that we have clear 
demands that we will not revoke no matter what pressure is 
exerted on us because these demands are just. The United States 
must put pressure on Israel and not on the PLO. Such pressure 
will not serve the peace process because it reflects injustice 
meted out against the Palestinian people who are in danger. 
  [Na'na'] Let us return to the Russian stand, Moscow's 
initiatives, and visits by Russian envoys. 
  [Qaddumi] Russia is a friendly country. It is a cosponsor of 
the peace process. We welcome the Russian friends' initiatives 
just as we welcome the initiatives of other friendly European 
countries. Turkey has contacted us. The Turkish foreign 
minister and Turkish President Sulayman Demirel offered their 
good offices to help end the crisis. It is not an issue of 
wagers but an issue of pursuing successful means that maintain 
our people's security and safety and that push the peace process 
forward. 
  [Na'na'] Do you have an alternative to continuing the 
negotiations now that the peace process reached this point? 
  [Qaddumi] There is a wrong notion that signing the Oslo 
agreement means stopping the Palestinian struggle. This is not 
true. As long as there is an Israeli soldier inside the 
Palestinian territories, then the resistance must continue. If 
the Israeli soldiers get out of our territories, then the 
intifadah will no longer be justified as it is meant to stand 
against the occupation and get rid of it. I noted this at the 
Arab League after the signing of the agreement. I very clearly 
stated that the intifadah will continue as long as there are 
Israeli soldiers in our territories. According to international 
laws and the UN charter, it is our right to resist in order to 
end the occupation, oppression, and persecution. 
  We are now in a better position because Israel will be 
politically besieged just as it was during Shamir's days. The 
world, which condemned the Hebron massacre, realizes that Israel 
is a racist country and a hotbed of tension in the region. 
There must be an end to its defiance, which threatens security 
and peace. We sensed this from statements by countries that are 
considered Israel's friends. 
  Moreover, the Jewish communities in many countries have 
announced their condemnation. The Zionist movement is afraid of 
a return to anti-semitic currents. They are now feeling the 
pressure because they made a mistake and they themselves have 
condemned it, as evident in the condemnation issued by the 
Zionist organization AIPAC [American-Israel Public Affairs 
Committee] in the United States. It is an admission of the 
perpetration of a crime against the Palestinian people, the 
price of which they will have to pay. 
  [Na'na'] Israeli investigations proved the Army's 
involvement in what took place inside the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. 
Despite this, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin responded to the 
massacre by allying himself with a right-wing party. What are 
your conditions for returning to the negotiations? 
  [Qaddumi] There are different roles in Israel. Peres is 
playing games in an intelligent way and Yitzhaq Rabin is 
intelligently taking advantage of Peres' games. We well realize 
that Israel's basic objective is to absorb the West Bank and the 
Gaza Strip. This is because the West Bank offers Israel four 
advantages. These are: 
  -- Space for more settlement building. 
  -- It forms natural borders with the river Jordan. 
  -- The Israelis consider the West Bank area and the 
heritage it contains as historical and sacred. This is where 
the differences over Jerusalem and holy places come in. 
  -- Subterranean water. 
  The Israelis feel that Gaza is a burden to them. However, 
this does not mean that they will do away with it without having 
a foothold in it. As for the settlements, the discussion of 
which was delayed for two years, they say that the agreement 
affirms the removal of these settlements as soon as possible 
without having to discuss the issue for more than the first year 
or the beginning of the second one. In the end, they wanted us 
to coexist with these settlements. However, the deal was for us 
to accept a full withdrawal from Gaza and the Jericho area, 
defined by the British Mandate for Palestine in 1932, and to 
postpone the discussion of thorny issues, which we may not be 
able to solve in a short time. These include the issues of 
refugees, Jerusalem, and settlements. However, through the 
negotiations, they insisted on controlling security at crossing 
points, continuing their presence in and the protection of 
settlements and expanding them beyond limits. This really means 
that they will not get out of Gaza and Jericho, they will not 
implement the agreement, and they will not withdraw as scheduled 
under the security pretext. This is as if Peres is claiming 
that Mr. Yitzhaq Rabin does not agree on this and that there are 
differences between them while, in fact, there are no 
differences but a distribution of roles. 
  If Israel wants peace, it should fully withdraw from Gaza 
and 
the Jericho area that reaches 345 square km. However, we know 
that they are playing with the time factor and seeking to take 
advantage of it. Yitzhaq Rabin does not want peace. Through 
the Army, he is trying to obstruct the negotiations and to open 
the way for Peres to say: There are problems inside the 
territories. The PLO must forgive us as we promised the Knesset 
to keep the settlements and we cannot go back on this. 
  The fact is that we do not accept these claims. As I said 
from the start, Israel will not implement the Oslo agreement. I 
opposed the agreement out of this conviction. There has to be 
an Arab deal because we alone, as Palestinians, cannot stand 
against this ferocious racist onslaught. 
  [Na'na'] At present, the Palestinian scene is in turmoil. 
Your people in the occupied territories are concerned and 
insecure. As Palestinian leaders, can you contain these 
feelings of concern and insecurity, and provide the necessary 
solutions to pacify the people under occupation, who constantly 
feel threatened? 
  [Qaddumi] The Palestinian people expect the PLO and the 
Palestinian leadership to take a firm position this time, 
because the event is too colossal to be brushed aside by any 
leadership, regardless of the credibility it may enjoy or the 
popular esteem it may command. Physical and practical measures 
are required. I hope that the United States will understand 
this fact and promote peace and the peace process. Israel must 
pay a political price. We feel that enormous wrath is raging 
within the souls of Palestinian people. The leadership must 
reflect the sentiments of the people by making the necessary 
decisions. We must understand the signals given to us by our 
generous people. We must provide them with the necessary and 
proper protection. The current international circumstances 
provide a propitious opportunity for obtaining such protection. 
We must not let this opportunity slip from our hands. 
  [Na'na'] The Soviets [as published] have proposed the 
reconvening of the Madrid conference. However, talk of such a 
development died down after the United States opposed this. Do 
you believe that a reconvening of the Madrid conference could be 
useful, in terms of promoting the peace process? 
  [Qaddumi] Before the reconvening of the Madrid conference, 
or 
the start of any form of negotiations for that matter, Israel 
and the United Nations must institute physical measures on the 
ground, tangible measures the effect of which can be felt by the 
Palestinian people, to maintain the momentum of the peace 
process. As for a reconvening of the Madrid conference, it is 
an important proposal. The proposal is a fine one if it means a 
meeting held by the big powers to explore the reasons for the 
procrastination in the peace talks, the developments of the 
peace process, and its failure to yield results after 22 months. 
With regard to the current U.S. Administration, it is biased 
toward Israel. Consequently, the peace process will continue to 
stumble and falter. The world community must realize that 
Israel is to blame for these setbacks and difficulties, because 
it has failed to comply with the Declaration of Principles [DOP] 
and withdraw [from Gaza Strip and Jericho], it has set new 
conditions not enshrined in the basic agreement, and also 
because of its practices, which capitalize on the Palestinians' 
strong desire for peace. Exploiting this desire, Israel seeks 
to force its own interpretation of the DOP. 
  Yes, a reconvening of the Madrid conference is a good idea, 
because it would allow us to draw up new foundations for the 
peace process. I believe that the current U.S. Administration 
is not as well-versed in the Palestine question as was the 
previous administration. President Bush was well-intentioned in 
his quest for progress in the peace process. Hence, we could 
use a new conference that should include, not just the United 
States and Russia, but also France, Britain, and China; that is, 
the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. This 
means the rehabilitation of the UN resolutions that call for the 
convening of a UN-sponsored conference with effective 
international participation and with the attendance of the PLO 
in its capacity as the sole legitimate representative of the 
Palestinian people on an equal footing with the other parties 
concerned to promote the peace process on clear bases. 
  [Na'na'] There is strong opposition to the Palestinian 
leadership, both inside and outside the occupied territories. 
Several memorandums and petitions opposed to the leadership have 
been signed. Some of these memorandums have reached the 
attention of President 'Arafat. Do you not believe that the 
current phase requires a convening of the Palestine National 
Council, or of the PLO Central Council, at least? Given the 
tragedy being experienced by the Palestinian people, is it not 
proper to call for a national reconciliation conference to be 
attended by all factions? 
  [Qaddumi] Not all the memorandums submitted to the 
leadership expressed opposition. Some of these memorandums have 
expressed criticisms of the results produced by the DOP. Other 
memorandums demanded the enhancement of national unity, and 
urged that the Palestinian house be put in order. Some 
memorandums have urged expedited efforts to put the Palestinian 
house in order, streamline action, and promote collective 
leadership within the PLO, and shun single-handedness. Other 
memorandums noted the unsatisfactory state of affairs plaguing 
the PLO and inter-factional ties. All in all, we deem this 
constructive criticism. We welcome this criticism and hope for 
its continuation, because it promotes construction, 
organization, and favorable action. For Palestine is not the 
property of a single leader or faction. It is the property of 
the whole Palestinian people, with all their factions and 
leading figures. The policymaking regarding Palestine should 
not be the monopoly of anybody. I, in my capacity as secretary 
of the Fatah Central Committee, am saying this in public, to 
make things clear. Yes, we do make mistakes. We have an 
abundance of flaws. Who does not? People who work make 
mistakes. However, we must learn from these mistakes, correct 
them, listen to people's views, and share with them. Sharing is 
indispensable. For we cannot reach an understanding with other 
factions if they do not share with us, in terms of work, 
decisionmaking, and execution. He who believes that he can make 
the masses and factions do whatever he likes is mistaken. 
Future developments will prove this. When ideas and approaches 
conflict, this should not lead to division. I might oppose some 
leading figures on many issues. But, it remains to be said that 
we must be able to work together. They, enjoying a majority 
vote, want to go through the experience offered them by the DOP. 
That is fine with me. We must respect democracy and hold free 
discussions, away from character assassination. We must not 
muzzle people. At the same time, there should be no division in 
our ranks. because division results in losing both ourselves and 
the cause, as well. 
  Nonetheless, when a decision is made, everybody must 
demonstrate discipline and act within the fold. 
  [Na'na'] Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the 
world has been in a state of imbalance. This adversely reflects 
on our region and the Third World in general. Can the PLO 
assume the burden of this crucial stage alone without Arab 
coordination or Arab solidarity? 
  [Qaddumi] The absence of world conflicts and diverse 
opinions, which lead to rivalry in sympathizing with and seeking 
a solution to just fateful causes, has an extremely negative 
impact on areas of crisis and tension. Nevertheless, we note 
that special attention is given to the Middle East due to the 
existence of many material and strategic interests there. 
Western Europe considers our region its main market, in 
addition to black Africa. The United States has its oil, 
commercial, and strategic interests, too. But all this is not 
being exploited properly by us. What do we note when we take a 
look at the Arab situation? We find that division, weakness, 
and lack of solidarity have persisted since the end of the Gulf 
war. This has adversely reflected on the Palestine question. 
Had the Maghreb Union not supported the Palestine question 
before the Madrid conference, the settlement process would have 
been conducted under more unjust conditions for our people. 
  The PLO has restored relations with Egypt and Syria and has 
begun to enter the Gulf region. We believe we are on the right 
track toward Arab reconciliation. This, however, is not easy 
because the wounds are deep. But there should be a collective 
Arab security based on Arab terms that are respected by all so 
that both small and big states will feel safe from injustice. 
We are now trying to coordinate with the Arab brothers in order 
to hold a five-member conference in Cairo directly after 'Id 
al-Fitr. It will be attended by the Jordanian, Syrian, 
Egyptian, and Lebanese brothers with the aim of establishing 
full coordination. 
  [Na'na'] Apart from the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and its 
outcome, much is being said about economic talks between you and 
Israel. Some even say economic coordination is taking place at 
the expense of the future Palestinian relations with Jordan and 
the Arab states. You visited Jordan and held talks on this 
subject and you are undoubtedly aware of the outcome of 
negotiations with Israel. What can you say in this regard? 
  [Qaddumi] We categorically rejected customs union with 
Israel 
in our economic talks because it means we will become an Israeli 
province. They asked that the shekel be our official currency, 
but we rejected that although we do not object to using it 
equally with others at a certain stage because necessity knows 
no laws and we need some time to disengage the Israeli and 
Palestinian currencies. We told them: When we become 
independent and sit with you as peers, and when you withdraw 
your soldiers from our occupied territories, we can strike 
international agreements with you. The initial stage will be 
transitional and there will be no customs union or imposition of 
the shekel as an official currency. 
  Israel is an occupation force that robbed the Palestinian 
economy of its infrastructure so that it can be absorbed. This 
is one of their political aims. It is not an issue of 
cooperation. How can cooperation take place between a state 
whose national income is 26-28 billion [not further identified] 
while the national income of the West Bank and Gaza Strip is 
only 2 million? The individual's annual income in Gaza is $740, 
in the West Bank $1,470, and in Israel $12,500. Moreover, the 
economic annexes stipulate cooperation in all these fields. 
Actually, they aim at getting concessions from us in what 
concerns them, especially in subterranean water, electricity, 
energy, agriculture, and industry. Therefore, we say that the 
first step is economic independence and cooperation comes later 
when our economy builds a sound infrastructure. Consequently, 
no agreements can be concluded now because they will not be 
sound and will certainly be tilted in favor of Israel. 
  The Palestinian-Jordanian relations are brotherly relations 
between two peoples sharing common interests. These relations 
should be promoted in the next stage on the political and 
economic levels, especially since we are witnessing constant 
changes that require us to bolster these relations in practice 
and not only in daily statements. Therefore, we struck two 
agreements with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to serve this 
fixed target and to enhance cohesion between our two peoples who 
are linked with distinguished relations.

  [Text] Amman, March 16 (AFP)--A senior PLO official 
Wednesday [16 March] called for a timetable for evacuating 
Jewish settlers from the occupied territories. 
  Bassam Abu-Sharif, political adviser to PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat, said the settlers in the occupied West Bank and Gaza 
Strip "are an integral part of the Israeli occupation, and that 
is why it is necessary to set a timetable for their evacuation 
in parallel with the withdrawal of regular forces." 
  If the Israeli Government really wanted peace, Abu-Sharif 
said, "it must go ahead with such an evacuation." 
  The PLO demanded the dismantling of certain flashpoint 
settlements in the occupied territories following the February 
25 massacre of Arab worshippers in a Hebron mosque by a Jewish 
settler, Barukh Goldstein. 
  Abu-Sharif said the United States financed the construction 
of the Jewish settlements, and should "finance their evacuation 
as they did for the settlements in the Sinai desert," which was 
returned to Egypt. 
  He reiterated the PLO's refusal to resume peace talks with 
Israel until the United Nations "assumes its total 
responsibility for protecting the Palestinian people in the 
occupied territories." 
  The UN Security Council is due to vote Friday on a draft 
resolution on the occupied territories. 
  The PLO has called for the deployment of an international 
protection force in the territories.

  [Text] President Lamine Zeroual this morning received 
Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' and a letter from 
President Hafiz al-Asad. Talks dealt with the Arab situation 
and relations between the two fraternal countries. 
  The meeting was attended by Algerian Foreign Minister 
Mohamed 
Salah Dembri and Syrian Ambassador in Algiers Dr. 'Abd-al-Jabbar 
al-Dahhak. It was also attended by Dr. Mikha'il Wahbah, 
director of the special bureaus department. 
  At the end of the meeting, al-Shar' spoke to reporters. He 
said: I conveyed a letter from President Hafiz al-Asad to His 
Excellency President Zeroual dealing with bilateral relations, 
the overall regional situation, and internal developments in 
fraternal Algeria. I listened to his excellency's assessment of 
the situation in Algeria and the national dialogue. President 
Zeroual stressed his concern for Syrian-Algerian relations to 
me, and I emphasized to his excellency our concern for bilateral 
relations. 
  Al-Shar' added: We expressed our conviction that Algeria, 
through what it enjoys in terms of militant history and 
important regional and international status, must restore its 
position and effective role, particularly in the Arab World. 
This is because Arab and Islamic nations are facing great 
challenges, and Algeria has an important role to play in 
confronting these challenges. Collective Arab action will remove 
many dangers facing us, and will help us all serve our nation's 
objectives. 
  Asked about Syria's position on the Security Council's delay 
in passing a resolution regarding the Hebron massacre, the 
foreign minister said: Delaying a resolution by the Security 
Council is not important. What is really important is the 
substance of such a resolution. Accordingly, we say that such a 
resolution should not only condemn the hideous crime committed 
in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque; it should also address the real 
reasons behind committing such a crime. In other words, a clear 
position should be taken on the settlements and the armed 
settlers. These settlers should be disarmed, and the 
settlements should be dismantled as part of a comprehensive 
solution that will completely end the Israeli occupation of Arab 
territories. Otherwise, such terrible massacres can occur again.

  [Text] On the second day of Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq 
al-Shar's visit, he was received this morning by the head of 
state, Mr Liamine Zeroual. He then held talks with his Algerian 
counterpart, Mr Mohamed Salah Dembri. The talks started in the 
evening at Djenan El Mithak villa and revolved around bilateral 
ties and the Palestinian cause, which is at the center of all 
Arab states' concerns. Samia Azzi reports: 
  [Azzi] Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' visited 
Algeria 
for two days as a special envoy of President Hafiz al-Asad to 
meet President Liamine Zeroual. This morning, he was met on the 
second day of his visit by the head of state and handed over a 
message from Zeroual's Syrian counterpart, Hafiz al-Asad. 
  At the Foreign Ministry, Mr. Mohamed Salah Dembri received 
his Syrian counterpart. The talks were extended to include 
delegations of both countries. Mr. Faruq al-Shar' did not 
conceal the Syrian Government's concern about what was happening 
in Algeria. 
  The talks were not restricted to conditions in Algeria but 
included bilateral ties and their future. During the meeting, 
an agreement was reached to revive the activity of the bilateral 
Algerian-Syrian committee. It is to convene next June. 
  What is happening in the Middle East, particularly after the 
massacre at al-Ibrahimi mosque, and the Arab position in 
general, were subjects discussed by the two sides. They 
unanimously agreed on the necessity to put the problems forward 
at the Arab League's ministerial council during its ordinary 
session. 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Shar'] I am satisfied with the outcome 
of this visit. I am particularly satisfied with what I heard 
from President Zeroual concerning various issues -- whether 
those dealing with international or Arab spheres, including the 
importance of Arab solidarity and Arab unity to confront various 
challenges. We held in-depth discussions on the internal 
situation in sisterly Algeria and also on bilateral ties between 
the two sisterly countries and means of boosting them. [end

<F P=106> ["Press statement" issued in Algiers on 16 March] </F>
  [Text] Faruq al-Shar', foreign minister of the Syrian Arab 
Republic, visited Algeria on 3-4 Shawwal 1414 Hegira, 
corresponding to 15-16 March 1994, as a special envoy of His 
Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad of the Syrian Arab Republic. 
  During his stay in Algiers, he was received by His 
Excellency 
President Lamine Zeroual, who received a message from al-Shar' 
addressed to him by his brother His Excellency President Hafiz 
al-Asad of the Syrian Arab Republic. 
  A round of talks was held between Foreign Minister Mohamed 
Salah Dembri and Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'. 
Delegations from the two countries took part in the talks. The 
two sides reviewed the overall fraternal ties between the two 
countries and their future prospects. They decided to revive 
the meetings of the Joint Syrian-Algerian Committee in Algiers 
in June 1994. 
  The two sides also exchanged views on Arab and international 
issues of common interest, foremost among which is the Middle 
East peace process, and the obstacles plaguing it due to Israeli 
intransigence, procrastination, and attempts to drag the 
concerned Arab sides into partial solutions. They agreed that 
the desired regional peace must be just and comprehensive and 
grounded in the relevant international legitimacy resolutions, 
particularly UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. 
  With regard to the occupied Syrian Golan, the two sides 
reasserted the need for Israel to effect a complete withdrawal 
from the occupied Syrian Golan in accordance with the relevant 
international legitimacy resolutions. They also demanded 
complete Israeli withdrawal from all other occupied Arab 
territories. The two sides also said that the restoration of 
the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people must be 
guaranteed. 
  The two sides reiterated their condemnation of the heinous 
massacre committed by Israeli settlers at the holy Ibrahimi 
Mosque in Hebron, the occupied Palestinian West Bank. They 
appealed to the international community to shoulder its 
responsibilities in this regard to ensure the protection of the 
Palestinian people in the occupied Arab territories. 
  The two sides underscored that the drastic situation in the 
occupied Arab territories requires the termination of the 
Israeli occupation and the dismantlement of settlements in 
accordance with international legitimacy and the relevant UN 
resolutions. 
  The two sides examined the overall Arab situation and the 
sincere efforts required to rehabilitate Arab solidarity. They 
maintained that all efforts aimed at achieving a serious Arab 
reconciliation must be encouraged. The two sides also exchanged 
views on the topics listed on the agenda of the next ordinary 
session of the Arab League Ministerial Council. 
  Mindful of the importance of the issues pertaining to 
Mediterranean security and cooperation, and in light of European 
initiatives in this regard, the two sides urged an Arab 
initiative to call for a seminar to be attended by the Arab 
Mediterranean states for consultations and coordination, and 
also to crystallize joint positions toward these issues.

  [Text] The security services informed us about two hours 
ago that after thorough investigations in the Casbah district 
the security forces have been able to eliminate the gang that 
assassinated our colleague the journalist Hassan Benaouda on 5 
March. The security forces stormed a house in the Casbah 
district that was used as a hideout. They were able to 
eliminate two members of the gang -- Keriati Salah, 24 years 
old, the ringleader of the crime, and Dakadjar Mohamed, 26 years 
old. Three members of the gang were arrested -- Cherchali 
Samir, 23 years old; Bouhedda Hocine, 19 years old; and Lehdjal 
Djamel, 23 years old. 
  Also Today EL WATAN, quoting security sources, said that 
those supposedly involved in the assassination of our journalist 
colleague Abdelkader Hireche had been eliminated after the 
security forces clashed with the armed gang consisting of six 
people in the Rue de Constantine where they lived. Three of 
them were killed, the other three were wounded, and the weapons 
in their possession were recovered. The three who were killed 
were Chelila Laid, unemployed; Seblal Mohamed, unemployed; and 
Benkhoutir Nabil who lived in Tarablus Street in Hocine Dey. 
  The security services also said that during this week their 
forces had been able to eliminate 57 terrorists in Blida, 
Algiers, Batna, and Bouira Provinces. A large quantity of 
weapons that had been in their possession was recovered. 
Numerous terrorist elements, many of whom had been identified 
and were wanted by the security and justice services, were 
arrested.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "After Kashmir, the Pressler Amendment -- That </F>
Fond Hope Also Dashed"] 
  [Text] The United States has excluded Pakistan and 
Afghanistan from the list of countries which will receive 
international development aid in 1995. Robin Raphel, the under 
secretary of state and chief of the Clinton administration's 
committee on South Asia and the Pacific, told the House of 
Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee that aid to Pakistan 
was suspended under the Pressler Amendment. The Pressler 
Amendment has been helpful in slowing down Pakistan's nuclear 
program. After assuming office, the present government gave the 
nation good news that it would not only bring Pakistan out of 
the isolation resulting from the wrong policies of the previous 
government, but that it would also improve Pakistan-U.S. 
relations to such a level that it would lead to the annulment of 
the Pressler Amendment and resumption of U.S. aid to Pakistan. 
Stories about world support on the Kashmir issue and further 
revision in the Pressler Amendment by the United States, 
especially Pakistan's exclusion from it, could be heard in those 
days. But all the fond hopes are now evaporating one by one and 
it is becoming clear to the people that what they witnessed was 
a dream and what they heard was merely a story. 
  At first, the UN General Assembly was approached about the 
Kashmir issue and the government declared that once again they 
were raising the issue at the world body. A resolution was also 
presented about which the opposition claims that it was planned 
during the Nawaz Sharif government and it had also secured the 
support of most of the friendly countries as a result of 
lobbying by the previous government. But suddenly, the present 
government announced the withdrawal of the resolution and the 
people were told that it had been done due to the insistence of 
"friends" and their reported assurances. It was also said that 
those friends had assured that they would exert pressure on 
India and ensure that the Kashmir issue is resolved through 
negotiations. Naturally, the whole nation's attention was 
focused on the Pakistan-India talks in the first week of 
January. However, the talks remained unproductive and India not 
only repeated its old claim that Kashmir is an integral part of 
India, but also belied hopes of normalizing relations between 
the two countries by embarking on a major operation against 
Kashmiris in Sopor. The siege of the Hazratbal shrine also 
continued. 
  The government then adopted the policy of raising the 
Kashmir 
issue at the UN Human Rights Commission and the prime minister 
said that she would herself go and raise the issue at the UN 
body. Well, she did so and tried to convince the nation that 
India would face a defeat at the global forum and it would 
eventually lead to an end to Indian atrocities in occupied 
Kashmir and that India would be forced to resolve the Kashmir 
issue. 
  An impression was also created that the United States was 
backing the present government and it was putting pressure on 
India. In an attempt to satisfy the United States, the prime 
minister also announced that Pakistan does not help the Sikhs. 
Despite all this, the latest resolution was also withdrawn, 
thereby belying the government's claim that Pakistan is no 
longer an isolated country like before. 
  Whatever happened in Geneva is nothing but a clear 
manifestation of the failure of Pakistan's foreign policy. It 
has also been proven that not only did we fail to appease the 
United States, but we also deprived ourselves of the warm 
relationships we enjoyed with our traditional friends. India 
has now declared that it will not allow ambassadors of Islamic 
countries to visit Kashmir. The stand taken by the United States 
and European countries on this occasion is very obvious. 
  The Pressler Amendment is a discriminatory law against 
Pakistan as a result of which U.S. aid to Pakistan has remained 
suspended since 1990. The previous government paid no attention 
to improving relations with the United States or securing aid. 
The previous government, by launching the self-reliance 
program, created an impression that it did not need U.S. aid. 
However, the present government is quite active in this regard 
and it has been saying that restoration of warm relations with 
the United States will be its major and historic achievement. 
Propaganda was also launched about the withdrawal of the 
Pressler Amendment. But the sweet dream has now vanished. 
Because not only is the amendment still in place in its 
original form and aid to Pakistan for 1995 stopped, but the 
Clinton administration has also indirectly praised the 
amendment. Robin Raphel said that the amendment has helped 
bridle Pakistan's nuclear program. It seems that the talk of 
warmth in Pakistan-U.S. relations was only fiction and we as a 
nation were involved in self-deception in hoping that the new 
government and its leader are capable of taming the United 
States. Reports say that her proposed U.S. visit has also run 
into trouble and expectations from the United States are not 
likely to be fulfilled. 
  Given the situation, the government instead of keeping its 
eyes closed like an ostrich should pay attention to overhauling 
the country's foreign policy and make fresh initiatives for 
creating a consensus between the government and the opposition 
on major issues. It should also do away with mistakes which have 
been causing successive failures. 
  We have tried every means to appease the United States and 
put ourselves under its patronage only to find out that no 
encouraging response has been forthcoming from the other side. 
We are gradually losing the love and affection of our 
defendable friends due to our efforts to appease the United 
States. Our national dignity has also been injured due to our 
policy and it has also stalled our forward movement toward the 
goal of self-reliance. Therefore, instead of wasting any 
further time, the government should take the opposition along 
and devise a comprehensive strategy. It is not wise to keep 
trying that which has already been tried. No one was surprised 
at the U.S. behavior, but we are still being overwhelmed by 
absurd optimism, or at least pretending to be.

  [Text] Mashhad (Khorasan), March 16, (IRNA) -- The second 
assembly of Afghan Shi'ite and Sunni ulema was inaugurated here 
today with a message from President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani. 
  The four-day gathering is being attended by 400 Afghan and 
Iranian ulema, and political, cultural, and educational figures 
to discuss the role of the role in settling the present crisis 
and coming up with practical solutions to stablize the Islamic 
government and preserve national unity in Afghansitan. 
  President Rafsanjani in his message said Islam and high 
prestige the ulema enjoy in Afghanistan has created positive 
ground for ideological movements. 
  He said unfortunately internecine clashes and losses 
inflicted on Afghanistan as a result of this latest round of 
bloodshed, have marred the brilliant record of the struggle for 
liberation of the Afghan people. 
  Hojatoleslam Rafsanjani's message said that orphans and 
mothers who sacrificed their beloved children for the sake of 
Islam have pinned their hopes on ulema and mojahedin leaders to 
rid the country of war, bloodshed and disorder and to form an 
independent, broad based Islamic government to protect the 
rights of all Afghan people. 
  He voiced the Islamic Republic of Iran's support for islamic 
movements in Afghanistan and said Tehran is ready to do its 
utmost to assist the country in its reconstruction efforts.

  [Text] Vienna, March 16, IRNA -- North Korea's ballistic 
missile program is becoming "more ambitious" and U.S. officials 
are concerned not only about the nation's weapons programs but 
also its export plans, says Ashton Carter, assistant secretary 
of defence for nuclear security and counter-proliferation. 
According to U.S. Embassy Information Service here Wednesday, 
at a meeting in Washington convened for specialists on 
non-proliferation issues, Carter said that the United States, 
would like to control the export of "everything" to Iran and 
Iraq. 
  Explaining the Clinton Adminstration's Counter-Proliferation 
Initiative (CPI), he noted that Defence Secretary Perry and 
Central Intelligence Agency Director Woolsey will announce soon 
the new position of a deputy director for military support at 
the CIA's Counter-Proliferation Centre. 
  In the past, he explained, too much of Pentagon's 
counter-proliferation focus had been on characterizing and 
cataloguing individual nation's weapons program. In the future, 
the official suggested, the focus will be on what actions to 
take after certain countries acquire weapons of mass 
destruction.

<F P=106> [Commentary by M. Paye'dar: "Beijing-Tehran: The Need for </F>
Cooperation"] 
  [Excerpts] PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who is also 
the deputy prime minister, arrived in Tehran on an official 
visit yesterday. Qian Qichen, who is the second in command in 
the massive political apparatus of the PRC after Jiang Zemin, 
was quoted as saying on the eve of his visit that Iran is the 
most important country in West Asia, and in particular, in the 
Persian Gulf region. 
  He said: The PRC believes that Iran can play an immensely 
important role in the preservation of peace and stability in the 
Persian Gulf region. Qian Qichen cited the volume of trade 
between the two countries as $710 million in 1993 and added that 
this is the greatest trade volume between Iran and the PRC in 
the history their relations. Beijing is quite satisfied with 
this trend of expansion. 
  Commenting on the critical situation in the region, the PRC 
foreign minister said: Reports indicate that the sale of 
weapons to this region by some of the bigger countries in the 
aftermath of the Persian Gulf war are valued at billions of 
dollars. The PRC believes that the sale of arms to the region 
is certainly not in the interest of peace and stability. He 
said that he hoped that the countries exporting the weapons will 
adopt a policy of restraint in order to preserve the peace and 
stability in the region. [passage omitted] 
  The importance of PRC-Iran cooperation is obvious to anyone 
but it may be claimed that there has not been much attention to 
this matter. Even though in the past, there have been many 
visits and trips by numerous high-level officials, it appears 
that the level of bilateral relations has not changed 
qualitatively to attain what could be described as a new 
regional equilibrium. 
  Regardless of the reason for such a state of affairs, 
allowing it to continue in the face of the new international 
connotations of power and security that have emerged in the 
contemporary world does not seem logical. It is therefore not 
very effective to use the traditional lever of bilateral 
cooperation in all fields, and this in itself dictates the need 
for new parameters [preceding word in English] and a new 
atmosphere in their bilateral diplomacy. 
  Iran as well as the PRC enjoy special political importance 
within their respective geographical areas, even though this 
importance is not of uniform in regional and international 
affairs. However, both countries, in their own right influence 
that transcends their own political boundaries. 
  In any case, this importance has provided ample and logical 
reasons for Beijing and Tehran to deepen, expand, and revamp 
multilateral cooperation between them. This is significant for 
the following two reasons: 
  1. Beijing's expectations of Iran's role in the region and 
the direction that it envisages in this regard. 
  2. Iran's view of the PRC as a political power and a future 
economic power. 
  Regarding the first factor, as Qian Qichen stated, a country 
such as Iran cannot be ignored and the broadening of cooperation 
with Iran enjoys high priority. However, as for the areas of 
this cooperation, Qian Qichen implied the following: 
  1. Iran's importance lies in the Persian Gulf. 
  2. The expansion of economic cooperation and transfer of 
technical know how. 
  3. Military cooperation. 
  4. Beijing's willingness to cooperate with Tehran, 
especially in broadening the role of the Economic Cooperation 
Organization [ECO] and restructuring it. 
  Of course, the importance of Iran's role in the Persian Gulf 
is clear to all and Beijing is also completely aware that Iran's 
perception of the way the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman should 
be administered plays a fundamental role in promoting stability 
in the region. 
  In any case, the emergence of any kind of insecurity in the 
Persian Gulf--in view of the enormous investment by the PRC in 
the region, especially in the latter half of the 1980's--will be 
an immense source of concern for the PRC. The Persian Gulf war 
and the concomitant economic losses sustained by the PRC are 
still fresh in the minds of the PRC leaders. The huge sums 
(totally borne by the regional Arab countries) spent on 
beginning and ending the war and eliminating its consequences 
resulted in the suspension of all industrial and developmental 
projects in the region. The PRC also suffered massive losses, 
as the foreign demand for its goods was greatly reduced. The 
difference was that when the war ended--in view of the nature of 
the forces embroiled in the war, and the importance that the 
Arab governments attach to Western countries--Beijing did not 
get a piece of the cake, or more accurately, they were not 
allowed to have any. 
  This is why the PRC is pursuing its objectives in a totally 
different way than the Arab governments and why it considers 
Iran's role extremely important in attaining its objectives. 
Stability is the "elixir of life" for both countries and this 
is the best reason for mutual cooperation. [passage omitted] 
  The current trend, which lacks the desirable trend and 
volume, cannot be defended. It appears that most of Iran's 
imports are manufactured goods, which is not in keeping with the 
economic development program of the government, while the PRC's 
imports from Iran mainly consist of crude oil. This is the 
situation even though the Chinese have valuable experience in 
the fields of power generation, nuclear reactors for civilian 
use, light industries that generate employment, geological 
prospecting, building refineries, textiles, shipbuilding, port 
construction, airplane manufacture, agriculture, engineering, 
and urban construction. This expertise can be transferred to 
Iran if we do some intensive planning in this regard. 
  As for cooperation in the military field, the experts should 
give their views. Here, only one point can be mentioned and 
that is: The Chinese have made immense advances in the 
manufacture of defensive weapons; and the not so complex 
technology of Chinese weapons (of course as compared to Western 
weapons) is capable of being absorbed into Iran's defense system. 
  On the subject of cooperation with the ECO, to which Qian 
Qichen alluded, the PRC sees it in the perspective of Iran and 
Pakistan, but Iran is more important. The situation was 
different prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, but now 
Iran has common borders with some Central Asian countries that 
are eager to broaden their relations with Iran. Therefore, the 
Chinese are watching the ECO closely, as it should naturally 
culminate in expanding Iran's role. In addition, the 
establishment of a unified economic front stretching from Turkey 
to the northern and western borders of the PRC has immense 
economic and political importance to that country. This is 
especially so because most of these countries view the PRC as an 
independent politico-economic power which--after the collapse of 
the Soviet Union--will have the last word in Asia. 
  However, Tehran's vantage point is totally different from 
that of Beijing and is extremely strategic. In view of the 
international military structure, the perception that the PRC is 
a durable regional and international politico-economic force is 
gaining ground among Iranian leaders. Facts and figures 
indicate that this perception is very realistic. Beijing is a 
relatively independent force on the international political and 
economic scene and its model of national expansion has drawn the 
attention of many Third World countries. 
  On the international diplomatic scene, the PRC is the sole 
Asian member of the Security Council and can be of great 
importance to many countries in view of the largely Western 
composition of the Security Council. 
  In the economic field, the PRC can finish numerous 
uncompleted projects in Iran and can also make new investments, 
especially in the field of energy production. In this regard 
there appears to be only one obstacle, to which the PRC leaders 
should find a solution. 
  Unfortunately, it appears that in regard to the peace trend 
in the Middle East, the PRC has not adopted an independent stand 
and has ignored the overall interests of the Arab countries and 
Muslims of the region for the sake of Israel. Even though the 
traitorous talks on the Gaza-Jericho accord were in progress, 
the PRC restored ties with Israel and high-level delegations 
have been exchanged between the two countries. The Iranian 
officials should discuss this matter in their talks with the PRC 
leaders and should ask the PRC to take a more logical stance 
toward this negative phenomenon, in view of the Zionists' evil 
deeds.

<F P=106> [Interview with "Mr. Jalil," the secretary of the Democratic </F>
Party of Kordestan in Iran, by Mustafa 'Abdallah in Vienna; date 
not given] 
  [Text] ['Abdallah] I met him during a tour he was making 
of a number of European countries that took him to Britain, 
France, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and finally 
Austria, to explain the cause of the Iranian Kurdish people and 
inform the public about the aspects of their revolution. At the 
start of his interview he stated that their main goal is to 
overthrow the regime in Iran and establish a democratic regime 
in which human rights and the rights of national minorities will 
be respected. He added that the Democratic Party of Kordestan 
[DPK] represents 90 percent of the Kurdish people living in Iran. 
  What is the DPK's relationship with the Mujahedin-e Khalq in 
Iran? 
  [Jalil] By virtue of our common struggle against the present 
Iranian regime, we have strong ties with the forces that oppose 
this regime, including the Mujahedin-e Khalq movement, of 
course. Political cooperation is continuing. But regrettably 
there is no coordination in the field due to geographical 
conditions. But we are in the process of initiating such 
coordination. 
  ['Abdallah] You said that you are working to overthrow the 
regime in Iran. Is there a specific plan for this? 
  [Jalil] After having failed in the past 15 years to convince 
the Iranian regime to grant our people their national rights, we 
were forced to undertake military operations. We have dealt 
painful blows to the regime in many places, weakening their 
forces in these areas. By virtue of our indomitable struggle, 
we have turned Kordestan into an impregnable fortress for the 
Kurds. 
  Although there have been many victims, amounting to 60,000 
civilians and about 6,000 military men, our morale and the 
morale of our Kurdish people is high. Our struggle has 
strengthened the struggle fronts in many areas in Iran. 
  ['Abdallah] When do you expect your plan to overthrow the 
regime in Iran to succeed? 
  [Jalil] The Iranian regime is now closer to falling and is 
very weak. According to our study of the situation, the main 
problem lies in the absence of an organization that unites all 
the opposition forces to speed up the overthrow of the regime. 
But we are currently trying hard to establish a joint Kurdish 
organization and an Iranian organization of all the opposition 
forces to achieve our goal of weakening and overthrowing the 
present regime. 
  ['Abdallah] Mr. Jalil, do you have any information about 
Iran's support for terrorism? 
  [Jalil] It is known that the present Iranian regime is a 
terrorist regime in all respects. It resorts to terrorist means 
to achieve its objectives. Among these means are physical 
liquidation of the opposition forces and leaders. This is in 
addition to exporting terrorism. We have so far noted more than 
100 terrorist operations by the regime at home over a short 
period of time. In the past month alone, the regime carried out 
three terrorist operations against members of the Kurdish 
leadership, killing two of them in Kordestan and Iraq and the 
third in Turkey.

  [Text] The Egyptian authorities have decided that they will 
allow only 2,000 Algerian pilgrims to cross their territory by 
land this year on their way to the holy places. Last year, 
nearly 24,000 pilgrims travelled by road to perform the annual 
pilgrimage. 
  According to information available to us, the Egyptian 
authorities have demanded that these Algerian pilgrims travel on 
coaches laid on by tourist agencies and not by private 
transport, as has been the practice so far. This decision, 
which applies to all nationals from the Arab Maghreb, is 
believed to be due to security considerations.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "After Statements Attributed to </F>
Clinton, Arab Delegations Request Clarification on Status of 
Jerusalem"] 
  [Text] Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- In a new development 
related to the future of the Middle East peace process, the Arab 
parties concerned, the parties taking part in the negotiations, 
have sent an urgent memorandum to the U.S. Administration 
requesting official clarification regarding President Clinton's 
statement on Jerusalem in which he regarded both parts of the 
city as Israel's capital. The memorandum asked about the 
significance of that statement which ran contrary to a number of 
basic principles in the peace negotiations, in particular 
denoting a clear change in the U.S. line regarding the basis on 
which the Madrid peace conference was held, and which also ran 
contrary to the clear provisions of the UN Security Council 
resolutions, especially Resolutions 242 and 338 which stipulate 
that Israel should fully withdraw from all the Arab territories 
occupied in 1967 including Jerusalem. 
  Informed Arab and Palestinian sources in Cairo have stated 
that Washington's position on occupied Jerusalem requires a 
reconsideration of the Arab positions on the peace negotiations 
with a need for clear guarantees in this connection. 
  The sources said that the current intensive consultations 
with the PLO are not expected to yield clear results regarding 
resumption of the negotiations with Israel unless the issue of 
Jerusalem is resolved and guarantees are given that the issue of 
Jerusalem will still be on the agenda of the negotiations. The 
sources added that, in these consultations, the PLO declared its 
rejection of any change in the status of Jerusalem, emphasizing 
that the issue should be included in the provisions of the new 
[draft] agreement before the resumption of negotiations with 
Israel.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Arye Golan </F>
in Washington on 16 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Golan] Mr. Prime Minister, do you agree to a 
Palestinian police force being deployed in Hebron if it serves 
under the Israeli military government, and how many policemen 
are we talking about? 
  [Rabin] I would have been happy had the policemen who served 
within the framework of the Israel Police right up to the 
intifadah returned to their posts. I regretted their 
resignations at the time and I would be happy if they returned, 
but under the clear understanding that overall responsibility 
for security in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip -- as long 
as we have not reached and implemented the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement -- lies with the State of Israel via the military 
government and the Civil Administration. We wanted the 
policemen to remain, but they decided otherwise. I would be 
happy if they returned to their posts, but we must realize that 
they will be subservient to Israel's authority. 
  [Golan] Mr. Prime Minister, do President Clinton and 
Secretary of State Christopher believe that your proposal to 
recruit the Palestinian police in Hebron, as you have suggested, 
will suffice to return the PLO to the negotiating table? 
  [Rabin] I did not suggest anything, I told them that was the 
situation, just as I have been telling you. The resignation of 
the policemen was not what we wanted. In places where policemen 
showed a readiness to remain, we were pleased, and we welcome it 
now too. 
  [Golan] Following your Washington talks, how do you estimate 
the chances of renewing the talks in the near future, first with 
the PLO and then with the Arab states? 
  [Rabin] I very much hope and believe that the Palestinians 
must also have an interest in advancing the negotiations because 
without a joint interest we will not reach an agreement. Peace 
is not imposed. We do not impose anything on them and they 
cannot impose anything on us. The peace negotiations must be in 
the interest of all the involved sides. No side can dictate 
terms contrary to what has already been agreed because of some 
incident, no matter how tragic, such as the Cave of the 
Patriarchs massacre. We did not demand any changes in the 
agreement we reached with the Palestinians in the wake of 
terrorist activity by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] or its 
likes against Israelis. 
  [Golan] How do you feel when demonstrators carry placards 
showing you wearing a kaffiyeh? 
  [Rabin] I am so used to it that it does not have any effect 
on me. 
  [Earlier in the newsreel, Golan quotes Rabin as calling the 
PLO demands to evacuate Hebron settlers and deploying an 
independent Palestinian police force or international force in 
the town "a nonstarter," which he rejected outright. Golan says 
Rabin told Israeli correspondents in Washington, that "it is 
unfeasible to have an armed police force in Hebron which is not 
subordinate to Israel." Rabin said Israel is considering various 
proposals to alleviate the situation for the Palestinians 
without harming security. "Referring to the Syrian track, the 
prime minister said that in his talks with President Clinton, 
they discussed the components of peace -- the scope of the 
withdrawal on the Golan Heights, security arrangements, the 
stages for implementing the agreement, and the substance of the 
peace -- but there was no detailed discussion on the depth of 
the withdrawal." Rabin also raised with the President, the 
growing Russian involvement in the Middle East and "called for 
better coordination between the cosponsors of the peace process." 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 17 March 
quotes Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu as rejecting the idea 
of deploying Palestinian policemen in Hebron.]

  [Text] Faruq Amin, commander of the Palestinian police 
force designated to operate in the territories, said that the 
decision to deploy Palestinian policemen in Hebron must have the 
PLO's agreement, and calls for a separate agreement on that with 
Israel. 
  This view is shared by (Umayah) Tahbub, Hebron's former 
deputy police commander. Our correspondent Moti Amir notes that 
the two served in the Israel Police in the territories and 
resigned early in the intifadah, and now guard Faysal 
al-Husayni. They said that the proposal has not yet reached the 
PLO leadership in Tunis and that the Palestinians will not agree 
to deploy the policemen if they remain under Israeli command. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 17 March 
carries 
a live telephone interview with Ziyad Abu-Zayyad, a member of 
the Palestinian advisory council, by Itay Engel and Mikhal 
Gazit, on the same issue. Abu-Zayyad thinks "the proposal can 
serve as a basis for trying to reach a wording acceptable to 
both sides, but to deploy the Palestinian police force which 
existed prior to the intifadah and say that it means the 
Palestinians are responsible for their own defense will not 
work."] 
  Hebron's Jewish settlers are furious about the reports that 
the government will consider the deployment of Palestinian 
policemen in Hebron. They said such a move would lead to 
continued bloodshed in the area. A member of the Mate Binyamin 
Regional Council told our correspondent Gil Litman that the 
names of many officers and soldiers in the military reserve are 
listed in their offices and if Palestinian policemen come to 
Hebron they will be recruited to defend Hebron against these 
policemen.

<F P=106> [Report by Udi Segal] </F>
  [Text] The meeting between Prime Minister and the pope 
ended a short while ago. Prime Minister Rabin met privately 
with Pope John Paul II. The two men held a relatively short 
45-minute meeting. Rabin condemned the Hebron massacre and asked 
the pope to use his religious and moral authority to call on all 
parties to resume the negotiations. The pope, for his part, 
said that he hoped for peace in the Middle East before the year 
2000. The pope briefed Rabin on his plans to visit Lebanon. As 
for the possibility of coming to Israel, the pope said that he 
looked forward to visiting Jerusalem, but did not mention any 
dates. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin presented the pope with an 
ancient vase, approximately 3,000 years old, and said that he 
hoped the pope would be able to preserve the vase for another 
3,000 years. 
  Several minutes ago, we asked Prime Minister Rabin several 
questions pertaining to the political process. The prime 
minister replied that since he had just completed his visit to 
Washington, it was still too early to speculate on the chances 
for progress in the negotiations. As for the evacuation of the 
Jewish residents of Hebron, Rabin said: Although we will not 
reopen the Oslo and Cairo agreements we will definitely take 
more steps to guarantee the security of the Palestinians in the 
territories. The prime minister described the design of the 
Jewish settlement in Hebron as stupid. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 17 March, 
in 
a report on Rabin's meeting with the pope, adds the following: 
"Mr. Rabin told the pope he is eagerly looking forward to his 
visit to Israel." "Our correspondent in Rome Yosi Bar reports 
that Mr. Rabin promised the pope to bring peace and prosperity 
to the Holy Land. Following the meeting Mr. Rabin said the pope 
can provide spiritual and religious help to facilitate the peace 
negotiations. 
  "The Vatican's envoy stated that the pope has called on 
Yasir 
'Arafat to return to the peace negotiations with Israel. The 
envoy said that during his meeting with Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis 
he conveyed to him the pope's support for the rights of the 
Palestinians. The envoy -- who serves as the Vatican's foreign 
minister -- also stated that the Holy See is not mediating 
between the sides."]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says Israel knows 
that negotiations with Syria are a top priority now, and it is 
ready for them. Speaking to foreign correspondents in 
Jerusalem, Peres said Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin would 
investigate ways of advancing peace talks with Damascus when he 
meets in Washington this evening with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton. 
  On talks with the PLO, Peres said Israel could not agree to 
Palestinian demands for the removal of Jewish settlers from 
Hebron. But, he added, Israel would take additional steps in 
Hebron to meet Palestinian security concerns. He did not 
elaborate.

  [Text] The state commission of inquiry into the Hebron 
massacre this afternoon heard testimonies from members of the 
General Security Services. The session was held behind closed 
doors. 
  This morning's session was canceled, when members of the 
Islamic Trust, or Waqf, from Hebron failed to turn up. Waqf 
representatives said they would only testify before the 
Palestinian committees investigating the massacre or to an 
international inquiry. Mark Weiss reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Weiss] Five officials from the Hebron 
Islamic Trust, or Waqf, were summoned to appear before the 
commission of inquiry this morning, including the local Waqf 
head, Shaykh Salah al-Natshah, and the director of the Ibrahimi 
Mosque, Shaykh 'Atif Hammuri. The five didn't turn up, and this 
morning's session was canceled. 
  Hasan Tahbub, the head of the Islamic High Committee that 
runs Islamic affairs in the West Bank, explains the boycott 
decision. 
  [Tahbub] In spite of our full respect for the individuals 
and the high-level personalities, we consider that it is not a 
neutral commission. And, we are asking for an international 
commission to inquire as a fact-finding commission. 
  [Weiss] A statement put out by the commission judges 
expressed regret over the boycott, stressing that the commission 
is trying to clarify the truth and wants to hear from anyone who 
can help to achieve this end. A similar statement was issued by 
the Justice Ministry, which stressed that it was a state inquiry 
and not a government commission, as the Palestinians claim. 
  The commission has the right to summon the Waqf officials a 
second time, although such a move is unlikely. A second 
alternative is to use statements given by Waqf officials when 
the commission visited Hebron last week. [end recording]

  [Text] Jerusalem, March 17 (AFP)--The Jewish gunman who 
massacred 30 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque was with another 
armed settler, two soldiers told the inquiry into the February 
25 slaughter. 
  "I saw Barukh Goldstein arrive armed with an M-16 and his 
pistol," said Sergeant Kobi Yosef who was on guard duty at the 
entrance to the Tomb of the Patriarchs. 
  "Then another settler, who I didn't know, arrived armed with 
a short-barrelled Galil rifle." 
  An army ballistics experts said that all the Palestinians 
casualties had been hit by shots from a short-barrelled Galil, 
an Israeli-made assault rifle capable of firing up to 750 
bullets a minute. 
  Goldstein was beaten to death by Palestinians in the mosque.

opened fire with automatic weapons on an IDF patrol. Soldiers 
returned the fire, killing the two terrorists. One of those 
killed has been identified as a wanted member of Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] who is suspected of carrying out attacks 
against security forces and residents in the Gaza Strip. The 
area has been closed and an IDF investigation is under way. 
  Yesterday, security forces arrested five wanted members of 
the PLO's Fatah. In clashes in the territories yesterday, one 
Palestinian was killed and 37 wounded. 
  Meanwhile, a Jewish settler from Har Hevron was arrested 
last 
night after opening fire and overturning stalls at a junction 
outside Hebron. He opened fire after coming under a hail of 
stones. Several hours later, two more Jewish settlers opened 
fire in the same area after being stoned.

  [Text] Thirteen local residents were wounded as soldiers 
fired on rioters in Jabalyah in the Gaza Strip. In Janin, a 
Molotov cocktail was hurled at a Border Police patrol. Our 
correspondent Moti Amir reports that the policemen gave chase 
and detained the thrower, who had another Molotov cocktail in 
his possession. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1500 GMT on 16 March adds: 
"Palestinian students in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza today went 
back to school, after an extended interval which started after 
the Hebron massacre. In Hebron, students were prevented from 
going back to school by the ongoing curfew." 
  [The report further states that "a young Arab woman armed 
with a knife today attempted to stab soldiers near the Ramallah 
Police building. One of the soldiers fired at the assailant's 
feet. She was wounded and taken in for questioning."] 
  The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has started building an 
outpost in Qiryat Arba' designed to enhance settlers' security. 
The outpost will be situated on the Qiryat Arba' municipal land 
between Qiryat Arba' and the Giv'at Haharsina neighborhood. Our 
correspondent notes that the construction of the outpost is 
being done in concert and coordination with Qiryat Arba' leaders.

<F P=106> [Report by David Regev and military correspondent Arye </F>
Kiesel] 
  [Excerpts] For the first time in the Gaza Strip -- and for 
the first time since the signing of the Israeli-PLO Declaration 
of Principles -- the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] yesterday 
evacuated a whole military base from Gaza's Rimal neighborhood. 
The vacated area went back to the residents of the 
neighborhood. Confirming the report, official military sources 
noted that the evacuation came as part of the redeployment of 
troops in the Gaza Strip. [passage omitted] 
  Military correspondent Arye Kiesel adds: The evacuation of 
the base yesterday came after Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin gave 
his consent to begin a real evacuation from the Gaza Strip. A 
senior military source in the Southern Command said yesterday: 
"We are done with `thinning out the fat' from the Gaza Strip. 
The work was done in accordance with the operational order 
concerning a redeployment in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, and 
regardless of the massacre in Hebron." 
  Defense establishment sources voiced their assessment 
yesterday that the prime minister had given his consent for two 
reasons: First, as a public gesture to the inhabitants of the 
Gaza Strip and Fatah members there; second, to enable the IDF to 
carry out a rapid evacuation in the event that the peace talks 
resume and an agreement is reached on the beginning of the 
evacuation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 15 Mar (MENA)--An official Palestinian source 
said tonight that the Fatah delegation that visited the Israeli 
Knesset today consisted of Arabs from inside the occupied 
territories and was led by lawyer Ziyyad Abu-Zayyad. 
  The source said the delegation had a dialogue with an 
Israeli 
Labor Party delegation led by Ya'el Dayan, the party's official 
spokesman, with a view to ending the current crisis faced by the 
peace negotiations. 
  The source said that members of the Palestinian delegation 
stressed that peace and settlements do not go together, and 
Israel must realize that the PLO postponed the peace talks 
because of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
  The Israeli Labor Party, led by Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin, 
had invited the Palestinian delegation to visit the Knesset.

  [Text] President Clinton's remarks about Jerusalem are 
particularly noteworthy, although they would have sounded better 
had they not been said in the context of the UN Security Council 
resolution that is expected to mention East Jerusalem as 
occupied territory. We have to wait and see if and how the 
President's commitment to a united Jerusalem as the capital of 
Israel is translated into the vote of his UN delegation. 
  And, lest we forget the forum in which the remarks were 
made: 
The leaders of the Jewish community in the United States -- the 
same people whose lobbying and donations we so much like to 
dismiss -- are the ones who heard from the President his renewed 
commitment to the issue of Jerusalem.

<F P=106> [Report on interview by Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar </F>
al-Qadhdhafi to an "Egyptian media delegation" at al-Qadhdhafi's 
headquarters in al-'Aziziyah, near Tripoli, by Hilmi al-Namnam; 
date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] "Brother leader" is the name by 
which Colonel al-Qadhdhafi goes in Libya. You never hear his 
real name there, nor is he referred to as a head of state or any 
other official title, for that matter. You just see his picture 
and hear him referred to as the brother leader. 
  On the day following our arrival, the members of our 
Egyptian 
media delegation, had an appointment with the brother leader. 
We went to al-'Aziziyah, his official headquarters, a 10-minute 
drive from the capital. We entered a compound containing a 
number of small villas. Tanks, military vehicles, and armored 
vehicles lined the road to al-Qadhdhafi's tent. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi does not live in the tent, as we had imagined. 
He merely uses it as an office. The tent was furnished with a 
number of chairs and a desk with a telephone, a clock, and many 
copies of The Green Book on top. More copies of "The 
Green Book" and books written about The Green Book 
sat in bookcases about the tent. 
  The true al-Qadhdhafi is different from anything you may 
have 
read or heard. A minute after our arrival, he entered the tent 
with an escort of youths, all under 25. Only one girl, olive 
skinned, green-eyed, wearing jeans, was in the entourage. 
  When he talks, al-Qadhdhafi makes you feel that you are in 
the presence of a shrewd politician. A little while later, he 
changes into a rebel who wants to change everything and start 
all over. Sometimes he sounds like a young man, discontented and 
desperate. A bit later he is jovial, even clownish. In all 
events, you do not see him as a statesman. You almost ask 
yourself: How has this man stayed in power for a quarter of a 
century? A jumble of contrasting Islamic, nationalistic, 
socialist, and pan-Arab concepts race in his mind. 
  That morning, the Libyan press made a scathing attack on the 
Arab League, accusing it of complete impotence. Commentaries to 
this effect appeared on the front pages of three newspapers, all 
with similar headlines and phrasing. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi said that the Jamahiriyah's Unity Secretariat 
had verbally notified the League that it is thinking of 
presenting [to the People's Congresses] the issue of withdrawing 
from the League. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi said that there is no further justification for 
Libya's remaining in the League or for the League's very 
existence, saying that the Israeli enemy has become a strong 
candidate for membership in the Arab League. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi said: Qatar supplies Israel with natural gas. 
Muscat receives the Israeli foreign minister. Qatar is filing a 
complaint against Bahrain with the International Court of 
Justice. All this happens and the League is unable to do 
anything. 
  The Libyan leader added that he aims by this move to jolt 
the 
League into action and make it amend its charter. He said: The 
Warsaw Pact has been dissolved and so has the Soviet Union. 
Soon, God willing, NATO will be dissolved. Meanwhile, the Arab 
League has not changed. 
  I pointed out to Col. al-Qadhdhafi that his move comes at a 
moment he knows full well is inappropriate for amending the 
League's charter and therefore may weaken the Arabs and divide 
them further. He said: "By God, if no change is possible, let 
the entire Arab League lay in ruins. Let us abrogate Arab 
borders, open them up." 
  Al-Qadhdhafi said that he personally appreciates the efforts 
of Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, but 
the lack of cooperation on the part of Arab rulers renders these 
efforts futile. 
  The second urgent topic raised at this meeting was the 
Libyan-Western crisis over the Lockerbie affair. In this 
regard, Al-Qadhdhafi praised Egypt's efforts and President 
Mubarak's diplomacy and repeated exchanges with the United 
States, the United Kingdom, and France. He added: Despite 
Egypt's efforts, they have remained intransigent. They do not 
think much of the Arabs. We do not "impress" them. 
  I asked him how far could the confrontation between Libya 
and the West go, considering Western insistence on the handing 
over of the two Libyan citizens? He said: We no longer have 
anything to give. We have our backs to the wall, and we are not 
afraid of anything. We have stopped importing goods and spare 
parts from the West. Even France, in solidarity with the United 
States and Britain, has refused to work out a solution. If the 
Arabs had broken off negotiations with Israel, the United 
States, which supports Israel, would have resolved the problem 
with Libya. But the Arabs failed to do so. 
  Nonetheless, there is nothing that we fear; we are prepared 
to resist. I'll bet you have seen the armed people "and they 
are ready to bring the temple down on both themselves and their 
enemies." [reference to Biblical story of Samson] 
  Asked about the acts of terrorism in Egypt and Algeria, 
al-Qadhdhafi said: It is known that the leaders of terrorism 
and the new atheistic movements live in Washington, Bonn, 
London, and Paris. From there they send instructions to carry 
out of acts of sabotage inside Egypt and Algeria. This is all a 
part of a Western-crusader-Zionist conspiracy against the Arabs 
and Muslims. Their principal objective is to destroy Egypt, 
because they know well the importance of Egypt's weight and 
role, and that by sabotaging it they would cripple the Arab 
world. They are trying to stunt and balkanize Egypt. All those 
are Zionist objectives and the new atheists are implementing 
these objectives. 
  They should not call themselves Islamic Jihad, because jihad 
stands for the liberation of Jerusalem or coming to join with 
Libya to liberate Ceuta and Melilla. Jihad does not mean 
killing innocent people in Egypt nor killing truthful 
journalists in Algeria. This is not Islam. 
  To a question about the fate of former Libyan Foreign 
Minister Mansur al-Kikhya, al-Qadhdhafi said: He is a Libyan 
citizen and we are concerned about him. It is not true that he 
was an opponent. He was a junior employee when the revolution 
broke out. He worked with me until he assumed the position of 
foreign minister. He then became Libya's representative to the 
human rights committees. He sent me a message with our friend 
'Ashur Qarqum, saying that he would visit Libya. I told him 
that he is welcome, because he has been abroad for a long time. 
He was scheduled to visit the Jamahiriyah after his visit to 
Cairo. But I do not rule out the possibility that U.S. 
intelligence knew about it and kidnapped him. 
  He added: The CIA [preceding term in Roman script] is behind 
the whole thing and the U.S. President had nothing to do with 
it. Clinton is a good guy and he was against the Vietnam war. 
But the CIA is deceiving him; it made him support the 
bombardment of the Russian parliament building by tanks and 
strike Iraq. Al-Qadhdhafi said Clinton is a Democrat and they 
are our friends because, like them, we sympathize with the 
blacks. But the CIA is deceiving Clinton and has recruited 
agents to kidnap al-Kikhya. 
  When asked if he has evidence, he said: There is no 
evidence, but there is the CIA's black record. [passage omitted]

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following review of the 11 March 
issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Prayers and Demonstrations 
  2. Barukh Goldstein Is Alive 
  3. Lawyers Association Holds Conference 
  4. Writer Denounces Hebron Killings 
  5. SLP Leader Shukri Urges Arab, Islamic Unity 
  6. SLP Official Deplores Muslims' Situation 
  7. Writer Criticizes Mubarak's Speech on Muslims 
<H5>  PRAYERS AND DEMONSTRATIONS </H5>
  The 11 March issue of AL-SHA'B continues to report Egyptian 
people's reaction to and protests against the Hebron killings. 
It devotes pages 1-4 and 7 to lengthy stories of demonstrations 
and rallies denouncing the Hebron incident, citing speeches by 
Socialist Labor Party [SLP] leader Ibrahim Shukri and others. 
Speakers assail Israelis and Americans, denounce the United 
Nations, call for jihad, and urge severing ties with Israel, 
expelling the Israeli ambassador in Egypt, and boycotting 
Israeli goods. 
  An approximately 600-word report on pages 1 and 7 says that 
Egyptian mosques on the night of the Koran revelation were 
filled with the worshipers' "imprecations" against the murderer 
Jews and their supporters; against the murderers of Muslims, the 
Serbs and Croats; and against "oppressive rulers who failed to 
support the Muslims or who are involved in the killing of 
Muslims." 
  The report adds that the largest gathering took place in 
'Amr 
Bin-al-'Ass Mosque, which was packed with over 3,000 worshipers 
who repeated Koran reader Shaykh Muhammad Jibril's prayers that 
God might destroy and eliminate the Jews, shake the earth under 
the Serbs and Croats, and support the mujahidin in Palestine and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Angry slogans of "No God but God," "The 
Jews are the enemies of God," "Muhammad's army will return," and 
"Jihad is our course and dying in the cause of God is our wish" 
were chanted after the prayers. The worshipers urged the rulers 
to expel the Zionist ambassador from Cairo, recall the Egyptian 
ambassador from Tel Aviv, and to stop the "criminal" acts of 
normalization with Israel and the "alleged" peace process. 
  In an approximately 300-word report on page 1, Mahmud Bakri 
says trade unions, nationalist forces, and Egyptian parties in 
Dumyat held a huge conference, denouncing the "Zionist massacre 
of our fellow worshipers in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron." 
The report says the conference affirmed that the Arabs' and 
Muslims' right will not be recovered as long as we continue 
neglecting our rights, disregarding God's shari'ah, and silent 
about "those impotent, treacherous rulers." The conference 
called for opening the door to jihad for the Muslim youths to 
enable them to join their brother mujahidin in Palestine and in 
all Islamic countries. At the end of the conference, the report 
says, the youths of Dumyat burned the Israeli flag amid slogans 
calling for jihad and revenge against "those killers." 
  An approximately 500-word report by Nasir Faruq on pages 1 
and 7 says a wave of anger prevailed after the Egyptian students 
began their "blessed uprising" in protest against the Zionist 
massacre in al-Ibrahimi Mosque. After prayers, worshipers in 
northern Cairo emerged chanting slogans against "the enemies of 
Islam, the Americans and Jews, and demanding revenge against the 
Zionist enemies of God." The report provides detailed accounts 
of similar protests in other places. The SLP organized a mass 
rally at the party headquarters in Tanta to denounce the 
massacre. University students and lawyers also staged 
demonstrations, calling for severing ties with Israel and 
staging jihad against the Zionist enemy. 
  Another 320-word report on pages 1 and 7 indicates that the 
General Assembly of the Engineers Union urged the Egyptian 
Government to close the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, recall the 
Egyptian ambassador from Tel Aviv, and halt all forms of 
dealings with the Zionist enemy. It also called on Arab 
governments to withdraw the delegations taking part in the "lie" 
of the peace talks, provide assistance to the Palestinian 
intifadah, and launch jihad to "liberate Palestine." 
  An approximately 450-word report by Layla 'Abd-al-Hamid on 
pages 1 and 7 says the SLP's Women's Secretariat organized a 
seminar in response to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The 
seminar called for severing relations with Israel, expelling the 
Israeli ambassador from Egypt, reviving the common Arab market, 
halting talks with Israel, and lifting the blockade against the 
Iraqi people. A speaker, Asmahan Shukri, noted the frightening 
Arab and Islamic divisions and the United States' "domination" 
of the Islamic world. She says: "The United States is directly 
responsible for killing and displacing the Muslims in Bosnia, 
Iraq, Somalia, India, and Kashmir." 
  In an approximately 250-word report on pages 1 and 7 on the 
state authorities' "campaign of arrests" against SLP members in 
which 26 members have been arrested to far, the paper says the 
Interior Ministry escalated its campaign and arrested four 
others. They include Muhammad Muhammad al-Sunbati and his wife, 
who, the paper says, was arrested on charges of teaching the 
town's children the Koran, starting a Koran school, 
disseminating ideas of extremism among the children in 
preparation for overthrowing the regime. The report also says 
that Mrs. Mazaj 'Abd-al-'Aziz, the wife of Muhammad al-Sunbati, 
was also accused of performing prayers, leading women in 
mosques, and preaching to them. The report adds that only Mrs. 
Mazaj has been released but that the other four party members 
remain in detention. 
<H5>  BARUKH GOLDSTEIN IS ALIVE </H5>
  An approximately 140-word report on page one of AL-SHA'B's 
11 
March issue by Mahmud Babri claims that Barukh Goldstein, the 
Israeli who killed worshipers in a Hebron mosque, is still alive. 
  The author of the report says: "Important information 
obtained by AL-SHA'B affirm that Barukh Goldstein, murderer of 
the worshipers in the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque, is still alive 
and that he has been transferred to a safe Zionist settlement in 
the wake of the heinous carnage." The information, the report 
says, indicated that the buried body belonged to another Jewish 
settler who was killed near the site of the massacre. The 
report adds: "The information revealed the details of the 
Zionist plan to carry out the massacre, which was directly 
supervised by Zionist Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Israeli 
Army Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq." 
  The author says that the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre was 
carried out as a substitute for another massacre designed to be 
carried out in al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem during the 'Id 
al-Fitr prayers, planned by Israeli leaders and a Jewish woman 
settler, Theresa, the mastermind of the massacre. The report 
indicates that seven Zionists who are members of the Kakh 
Movement participated in the massacre. 

<H5>    LAWYERS ASSOCIATION HOLDS CONFERENCE </H5>
  An approximately 600-word report on pages 1 and 7 says that 
the Lawyers Association's Egyptian committee in support of the 
Palestinian people's jihad held a conference in protest against 
the Hebron massacre, in which many intellectuals, preachers, and 
"nationalist symbols" took part. Excited young men chanted 
Islamic slogans denouncing the massacre and the peace talks and 
demanding the launching of jihad to "liberate Palestine." The 
conference decided to send protest memoranda to all ambassadors 
in Egypt and to ask Arab rulers to hold an urgent summit and 
take firm resolutions against Israel. 
  In his speech, Mustafa Mashhur, Muslim Brotherhood's deputy 
general guide, said the Jews are the origin of terrorism, which 
began "when the Jews killed the prophets," and that the Jews 
harbor "deep hatred for Islam and Muslims." He called for 
raising young men on the spirit of jihad and keeping up this 
spirit in the "souls of the youths of Islamic awakening." 
  An Islamic preacher, Wajdi Ghunaym, charged that the Jews 
were behind the explosions that took place in Egypt and that 
they spread drugs and AIDS "in our country." He said the only 
Islamic solution for the Palestinian cause is jihad and urged 
police officers and men to point their guns at the Jews, not at 
the demonstrators who protested the massacre. 
  Lawyer Ahmad Rabi' al-Ghazali delivered a speech on behalf 
of 
the young lawyers, in which he stressed that "the Islamic creed 
is the sound and established basis which we should not abandon 
in confronting the Jews and that it is the spiritual weapon that 
must not be surrendered." He called for unity among all the 
nation's Muslims and Christians to "fight the Jews who are the 
enemies of all religions and races." 
  Another Islamic preacher, Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Kafi, said the 
Islamic soil is fertile and good to produce young men able to 
lead their nation. He called for overcoming differences among 
Islamic factions and said: "Everyone must know that the enemies 
of Islam, led by the Jews, are working day and night to hit us." 
  The committee moderator Ahmad Sayf-al-Islam Hasan al-Banna 
said the Hebron massacre is a message for the Muslims to wake up 
and revert to Islam because "their nations are in danger." 
<H5>  WRITER DENOUNCES HEBRON KILLINGS </H5>
  An approximately 500-word article by Mahmud Fayid on page 2 
denounces the Hebron killings and calls for ending the 
negotiations. The writer says this was not the first crime, nor 
will it be the last because both "the Bible and the Koran say 
that the Jews are the killers of prophets and are traitors." He 
adds that "they" are holding negotiations not to return the 
usurped rights but are negotiating with us to perpetuate the 
occupation. He notes that the remedy lies in God's shari'ah in 
raising the nation on jihad against the enemy and that jihad, as 
in the case of fasting, is a duty and both commandments urge the 
Muslim not to limit his concern and interest to worldly pleasure 
but to aspire to the "bliss of the world hereafter." At one 
point he says: This crime should not drive us to despair. We 
must realize that it is an enlightenment from God for us to be 
aware of the nature of the Jews and their treachery so that we 
may rectify our situation, stop being careless, and stop living 
in illusions." 
<H5>  SLP LEADER SHUKRI URGES ARAB, ISLAMIC UNITY </H5>
  On page 4, AL-SHA'B files an approximately 850-word report 
on 
SLP leader Ibrahim Shukri's speeches in Asyut and al-Minya 
Governorates about the Hebron killings and other topics. 
  Denouncing the Hebron incident, Shukri addresses those who 
are in line with the United States and Israel, asking them: 
"What do you say today about the United States, which prevents 
the Security Council from passing a resolution to protect the 
unarmed Palestinians from the evils of the Jewish occupier?" He 
says: "What do you say about the United States' silence over all 
forms of oppression, persecution, and horrors and liquidation 
suffered by the Palestinian people? O Gulf Arabs, what kind of 
normalization and peace are you seeking now that you have given 
the control over your economic and political affairs to the U.S. 
hegemony?" 
  At one point, he says that the United States and Zionism 
have 
rearranged their priorities after the collapse of communism and 
that the Arab and Islamic nations topped their "list of 
hostility." He calls for rebuilding the Arab and Islamic fold 
to protect the nation's interests in accordance with "God's 
injunction." 
<H5>  SLP OFFICIALS DEPLORE MUSLIMS' SITUATION </H5>
  Page 4 features an approximately 750-word report on an SLP 
seminar in which participants discuss the Muslims' "weak" 
situation, note "rulers' inaction," and demand the expulsion of 
the Israeli ambassador. SLP official 'Abd-al-Hamid Barakat says 
the Islamic nation has become "an easy prey for its enemies who 
kill the nation's sons, rape its women, and violate their rights 
amid the silence of everyone, "the silence of fear and 
cowardice." 
  Preacher Mustafa Hammad, SLP branch member in al-Minya 
Governorate, calls for caution against whom he describes 
"Zionist elements" in Egypt who are fighting against God's 
religion and urges adherence to the teachings of religion. 
  Another speaker, Islamic preacher 'Abdallah al-Samawi says 
the young men spend their time watching television that perverts 
them and destroys religion and morals. He notes: "Thus, some 
of the criminal Egyptian media contribute to achieving the aims 
of the Jews, who regard the neighboring nations as donkeys to be 
ridden by God's chosen people." Our misled youths spend hours 
watching television, which destroys religion and morals. The 
television could have been a teacher and enlightener but it is 
controlled by people who use it to wreck and destroy our youths." 
<H5>  WRITER CRITICIZES MUBARAK'S SPEECH ON MUSLIMS </H5>
  In an approximately 2,900-word article on page 5 of 
AL-SHA'B's 11 March edition, writer 'Adil Husayn criticizes 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' recent book. After 
reviewing the book, the writer criticizes President Mubarak's 
recent speech which, in his view, focused on the weak points of 
the Muslims. The writer says that the speech gave the 
impression that all evils in today's world emanate from the 
Muslims. Husayn adds that Islam is a religion of moderation and 
Islamic civilization has taught all races of the earth the 
meaning of tolerance but that tolerance for Muslims does not 
mean surrender and ignorance.

  [Text] A statement issued by the Muslim Brotherhood has 
stated that the U.S. President's recent remarks on Jerusalem as 
the eternal capital of the Zionist entity show his continued 
support for the Zionist enemy's racist policy of settlements. 
These remarks also reaffirm the stand of the U.S. 
Administration at the Security Council and its obstruction of 
the issuing of a mere statement condemning the ugly massacre 
perpetrated by the Zionist occupation forces, which blessed the 
Zionist settler's killing of more than 40 worshipers and then 
themselves killed more than 50 more people. 
  The statement noted that the peoples of the Islamic world 
are 
very angry about the U.S. Administration's stand, which flouts 
the rights of Muslims in Palestine and holy Jerusalem. The 
statement said that the utter silence by the governments, kings, 
amirs, and presidents of the countries of the Islamic world has 
produced a bad and bitter response among the Arab and Islamic 
peoples. In its statement, the brotherhood demanded the Islamic 
nation condemn the U.S. stand on the Palestinian cause and show 
popular anger toward this stand, which is totally biased toward 
the Zionist enemy. The brotherhood said: We remind the U.S. 
Administration that its interests are linked to the peoples of 
the Islamic world, that it is impossible to continue the current 
situation, and that the clear neglect of the rights of Arabs and 
Muslims in Palestine, especially in holy Jerusalem, makes it 
obvious that the United States has lost its neutrality and the 
possibility for its mediation in solving the Palestinian issue. 
This is clearly evident in the current negotiations. 
  And God hath full power and control over his affairs; but 
most among mankind know it not. [Koranic verse]

<F P=106> ["Text" of interview with President Husni Mubarak by </F>
AL-HAWADITH Chief Editor Milhim Karam in Cairo, originally 
published by the London-based AL-HAWADITH magazine, issue not 
given; date of interview not given] 
  [Text] [Karam] In your opinion, what will happen with 
regard to the peace process? 
  [Mubarak] Despite what has recently happened and despite the 
difficulties attending the negotiations, which is natural, we 
consider the peace process a basic issue for all Palestinians 
and the whole region. 
  I believe that the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque is a 
terrible tragedy. We were all deeply hurt by it. The person who 
committed this crime was an extremist and we all know how every 
extremist behaves. 
  I expect the peace process to continue; in fact, I am 
confident it will. I also know very well that the Palestinian 
and Israeli leaders need peace, and extremists in any part of 
this world do not want peace because they thrive in an 
atmosphere of extremism. However, the peace process must 
progress. 
  [Karam] What happens after peace? 
  [Mubarak] There has to be effective cooperation in the 
interests of the people. The French and the Germans were 
arch-enemies but common interests imposed cooperation upon them. 
The issue is not one of friendship, fraternity, and love; that 
is another issue among the countries of the region. There are 
mutual and shared interests and we all need to cooperate on them. 
  [Karam] What do you think about the growth of fundamentalism 
in the region? 
  [Mubarak] Fundamentalism in the region requires the 
attention of the leaders. It also requires firmness. 
Fundamentalism has existed for some time. It was never given 
the attention it merits. This was the case in Algeria, and today 
Algeria is suffering from this problem. The same applies to 
Tunisia as well, but the Tunisian leadership under Zine El 
Abidine Ben Ali has succeeded in muzzling and containing the 
growth of fundamentalism. This phenomenon also emerged in 
Egypt, but they are not Muslims in the real sense of the word. 
  They are all a batch of dangerous mercenary criminals 
manipulated from abroad. They are paid by some people who want 
to create unrest in Egypt and in the region. These sides are 
spending large amounts of money to implement their schemes. The 
Hebron operation is extremism par excellence. Extremism exists 
not only in our region but in the United States, England, and 
Australia. I do not wish to mention other countries. 
  [Karam] You mentioned that it should be paid due and careful 
attention. Does this mean that some leaderships have neglected 
this problem? 
  [Mubarak] I cannot call it negligence, but the leaders need 
to realize that some nongovernmental bodies with huge funds at 
their disposal are carrying out suspicious acts. We need to 
know how these funds are spent. In the end, extremism will bite 
the hand that feeds it. 
  Can you believe that the nongovernmental societies that 
solicit contributions spend these contributions only on building 
mosques? Bear in mind that these societies use mosques as a 
pretext to plant extremism in the countries where they build the 
mosques. They form hotbeds and cells in the various regions. 
When these hotbeds get stronger, they make their move. 
  [Karam] Don't you think that the lack of remedies for 
economic problems and poor living conditions are the cause of 
these movements' growth? 
  [Mubarak] They might be a secondary factor, but not the 
basic 
factor. Economic crises and unemployment existed in the past 
and economic problems have always existed worldwide. Why have 
these movements appeared only now? I remember we had the 
problem of a continually rising cost of living during my student 
days. It is not possible for a government employee to own a 
villa and a car and live in total comfort on his salary. A 
government employee's salary is small because it comes from the 
state's revenue, from taxes and customs duties. 
  [Karam] What is Egypt's attitude toward the new world order? 
  [Mubarak] What order? You should ask what Egypt's attitude 
is toward the new chaotic system. It is a chaotic system; 
today's world is chaotic. Is what is happening in Russia a new 
world order? Is what is happening in the eastern bloc a new 
world order? Is what is happening in Iran and Afghanistan a new 
world order? Is what is happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina a new 
world order? Do the conspiracies we see today indicate a new 
world order? The term is wrong; I call it the new chaotic 
system. Today's system is not permanent; it is transitional, 
and the final shape of the world order is not clear yet. China 
is still growing stronger, Japan's trade is prospering. There 
is a conflict between the United States and Japan. Indonesia is 
still making progress in development. Russia is still living in 
the shadow of nuclear and nonnuclear conflicts. The process is 
far from clear and will need a long time to settle down. We 
must not feel optimistic about the appearance of a new world 
order in view of the chaos in which we are living today. The 
international order will come only after the chaotic system ends. 
  [Karam] Your Excellency, as OAU chairman, could you please 
speak to us about Africa's aspirations? 
  [Mubarak] Development is scant in Africa. The continent is 
still suffering endless problems and will need great efforts and 
many years to overcome them. We are trying hard, something we 
began to do at the last summit, to end the current conflicts and 
disputes, which are mostly border disputes. Had they abided by 
the OAU summit's resolution of the 1960's... [sentence 
unfinished as published] May 'Abd-al-Nasir rest in peace. He 
used to say all African countries must accept the borders drawn 
by the colonialists and that they must not be at each other's 
mercy. Problems persist in Liberia, Nigeria, Somalia, and Sudan. 
  [Karam] What does the South want form the North? 
  [Mubarak] Dialogue. We do not want the North to buy raw 
materials from the South at cheap prices and sell commodities at 
exorbitant prices that the South cannot afford to buy. This is 
only one of several examples. A dialogue must be held between 
the South and North. It is unreasonable for the North to live 
in luxury while the South can hardly subsist. 
  [Karam] Egypt is a member of the Group of 15. Is this a 
nucleus for the South to reach a unified stance? 
  [Mubarak] That is possible, because all members of the Group 
of 15 are from the South. 
  [Karam] What about reconciliation in Somalia? 
  [Mubarak] There are numerous problems there. The African 
summit sought to set up a committee to settle the Somali 
problems. There are problems impeding our work. We hosted a 
meeting of certain rival Somali factions, but not Farah Aidid, 
who did not wish to come. As chairman of the OAU, I speak 
fairly and neutrally and I do not take sides with any party. I 
do not support Mahdi against Aidid or vice versa. We are 
working to achieve Somali unity. The rival factions must agree 
among themselves so that their people can lead a stable life. 
If the leaders fail to agree, the people will not be able to 
lead normal lives. Our goal is to work out a way for the rival 
factions to reach an agreement and form a government that can 
take care of the people's interests. 
  [Karam] What about Sudan and Hala'ib? 
  [Mubarak] What about Hala'ib? They raised this issue during 
President al-Sadat's as well as 'Abd-al-Nasir's eras. Now they 
are raising the issue with me. They want to fabricate a case 
against us. Al-Turabi wants to trump up a problem. They are 
free to do what they want, but we have no problems. 
  [Karam] What about the Nonaligned Movement and the Group of 
77? 
  [Mubarak] They are all aligned. Small countries need big 
ones to help them in their development plans. That is what 
brother Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi said. He is right; all the 
members are aligned. These days alignment concerns to whom and 
against whom. The Nonaligned Movement has lost its reasons for 
existing. 
  [Karam] Will the Hebron Mosque massacre recur? 
  [Mubarak] I pray to God it will not recur against anyone -- 
be they Muslims, Christians, or Jews. 
  [Karam] And the Sayyidat al-Najat Church massacre in al-Zuq? 
  [Mubarak] That was also a painful massacre for all of us. 
People are getting mad. What have innocent people done? Why 
has the criminal entered the mosque to kill people? Why have 
they entered the church to kill people? Worshipers went to holy 
places to pray to their God, but had a date with death instead. 
Is this acceptable? 
  If a Muslim makes a mistake, then let us deal with him 
personally. If a Christian makes a mistake, then let us deal 
with and punish him personally. If a Jew makes a mistake, let 
us deal with him personally and not butcher people at random. 
  [Karam] Since we mentioned Lebanon, what about Resolution 
425 
and peace, especially as Egypt has responded to the Arab League 
resolution in Damascus to help Lebanon in its dealings with the 
Arab countries. What is the extent of this help? 
  [Mubarak] We are committed to this aid and the time will 
come 
to send it to Lebanon. 
  Regarding the issue of peace, we have been working for peace 
in Lebanon in all international circles even before the peace 
process began. When Shim'on Peres was prime minister, I spoke 
with him about the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon. He was 
convinced and drew up the withdrawal plan. He told me: If you 
guarantee that not a single Katyusha will be fired at northern 
Israel, then I will withdraw immediately. Peres also told me: 
I do not want to stay in Lebanon. An Israeli withdrawal must 
be provided for in the peace process. 
  [Karam] Is the peace process serious and imminent? 
  [Mubarak] Of course, but it requires some time. Let us not 
forget that this issue is 45 years old and we should not expect 
it to be resolved immediately. 
  Of course there are obstacles, but peace is coming. The 
Palestinian issue is the crux. 
  [Karam] Is the Israeli Government in danger and will 
extremism triumph in Israel? 
  [Mubarak] I do not believe that extremism will win in 
Israel. 
Either Israeli or Palestinian extremism might delay the peace 
process, but they will not sabotage it because peace is the just 
demand of the peoples, who want to live. 
  [Karam] What is the fate of the negotiations with Israel? 
  [Mubarak] They are part of the peace process. Israel and the 
Palestinians are supposed to meet in the United States in order 
to act on what they decided on in Cairo. They almost ended all 
the differences. The agreement that they reach in the United 
States will later be signed in Cairo. 
  [Karam] Will Lebanon and Syria reach a solution with Israel 
on its withdrawal from the Golan and the south? 
  [Mubarak] I am confident that these two issues will be 
solved. 
  [Karam] What about Iraq's status; and how are the current 
ties between Egypt and Iraq? 
  [Mubarak] We feel sorry for the Iraqi people. We are against 
the partitioning of Iraq. Our stand on this issue is firm and 
clear-cut. We support the Iraqi people, who cannot eke out 
their livelihood. What pains us is that the Iraqi people are an 
Arab Muslim people. Had Saddam Husayn heeded my words and 
honest advice, nothing would have happened. His position could 
have grown even stronger and that Iraq's strength could have 
been an additional force in support of the Arab force. 
  [Karam] What about Egypt's relations with Saudi Arabia? 
  [Mubarak] Our relations with Saudi Arabia and all the other 
Gulf states are good and fraternal. 
  [Karam] And what about your relations with Iran? 
  [Mubarak] We have no relations with Iran. We were about to 
exchange ambassadors a year ago. But obviously they differed 
among themselves. Velayati said he would open an embassy 
office. I told him: No thank you; we do not need embassy 
offices. 
  [Karam] What about your relations with Lebanon and Syria? 
  [Mubarak] They are integrated, fraternal relations. 
  [Karam] What do you think of the situation in Algeria, and 
what about the Lockerbie issue? 
  [Mubarak] I hope that our brothers in Algeria, led by 
President Zeroual, will end the rancorous extremism that is 
bound to nullify all the people's potentials. All sides, if 
they wish to preserve their country, must sit together with the 
president and talk about solutions that will end the problems. 
  As for the Lockerbie issue, we made strenuous efforts, but 
the world is currently preoccupied with the security of Bosnia 
and Somalia. I hope we will find a solution that will enable 
Libya to end the issue, because handing over citizens is 
difficult and sensitive. 
  [Karam] Has communism ended? And what about Egypt's 
relations with Russia today? 
  [Mubarak] Egypt's relations with Russia are very good. It's 
my policy to establish good relations with all countries. I do 
not want to be anyone's enemy. Only Iran is hostile to Egypt. 
We are not hostile to Iran. We did not even sever ties with 
Sudan, which cooperates with Iran. 
  There are 4 million Sudanese citizens in Egypt, maybe more. 
President al-Bashir once told me that there are only 120,000 
Sudanese in Egypt. I told him: I can send them to you so that 
you can count them. 
  As for communism, we cannot say that it has ended. It is 
developing so as to be in line with the new world order, or the 
new chaotic order. 
  [Karam] Has tourism suffered a setback in Egypt? Have the 
fundamentalists' acts of violence frightened tourists away? 
  [Mubarak] Yes. The number of tourists visiting Egypt has 
decreased. The fundamentalists -- whom I call terrorists -- 
have nothing to do with religion. None of them memorizes a 
single Koranic verse. Egypt's civilization goes back 7,000 
years, so Egypt will not be crippled by a group of terrorists. 
Egypt is not just Husni Mubarak: There are a million Mubaraks 
and leaders in Egypt. The terrorists will have no impact on this 
state, which believes in its democratic course. 
  [Karam] Has the Egyptian economy suffered a recession as a 
result? 
  [Mubarak] Recession is affecting all countries of the world 
and not Egypt alone. There is recession in Europe, the United 
States, and all other countries. 
  [Karam] Those who like you say that President Mubarak is 
inimitably easy going, that is, his cards are on the table. 
Despite this, he plays his cards well, puzzling other players. 
President Mubarak's approach is that he does not despair if 
there is little hope. He does not show his emotions and always 
maintains his poise. How have you managed to combine all these 
qualities? 
  [Mubarak] This is my way of life, since I started work, when 
I was a pilot. I have always been patient, thought ahead, and 
planned for the future. I do not look just at what is under my 
nose but ahead. I not only work for tomorrow but for what comes 
after tomorrow. If I merely wanted to work for tomorrow, people 
would stand in line and applaud me, but when I am gone there 
would be a collapse. I think of the future generations. I do 
not want to be egoistic, but I want those who come after me to 
live. I do not just seek my own good. Had the infrastructure 
been taken care of before, I would not have had to spend 100 
billion pounds on rebuilding it. We would have a more prosperous 
life, but this is our fate. After we finished with war, we 
began to work to enable our people to live. We built the 
infrastructure and then the new cities, factories, agricultural 
projects, and production sites for the Egyptian people. 
  [Karam] What are you doing to resolve the problem of the 
1.25 
million people born in Egypt every year? 
  [Mubarak] That number is currently decreasing and we are 
trying to create many jobs for Egypt's sons. 
  [Karam] Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat has repeatedly 
described Egypt as a full partner of the Palestinians. How does 
Egypt view its role within this framework? 
  [Mubarak] The Palestinian issue is our own; we have adopted 
it. We were attacked several times for adopting this stance. We 
still defend the Palestinian issue; we cannot go back on our 
support for the Palestinians. 
  [Karam] You played a personal and effective role in 
concluding the Cairo agreement at a time when the talks had 
almost failed. Did the problem lie in the Palestinians' refusal 
to abandon the Oslo agreement or in their bypassing of that 
agreement? 
  [Mubarak] We tried to help the Palestinians when they 
reached 
a dead end and asked for our help. We spoke with the Israelis 
and solved the obstacle to the talks. 
  [Karam] Some moderate Palestinian parties saw in the Cairo 
agreement an unwarranted concession on their part. What is the 
Egyptian view of this? 
  [Mubarak] You have to get a foothold and then ask for more. 
Public opinion must know that coexistence will happen. 
  [Karam] There is a prevailing belief that the Cairo 
agreement 
was lax on the issue of the existence of the settlements and the 
settlers' freedom of movement during the transitional stage, as 
this would strengthen their presence even in the final stage. 
This entails the building of roads and bridges that will cost 
too much and are unjustifiable. If the transitional period is 
to last just three years, why build bridges and roads? 
  [Mubarak] We have nothing to do with the details; they are 
the affairs of the two sides. As to the first part of the 
question, I say that you cannot demand the removal of the 
settlements on the first day of your entry. First you have 
first to enter and settle down. The contacts will lead to a 
solution of the settlement issue and both sides will reject this 
issue. [sentence as published] Had they accepted the principles 
of the Camp David agreement, they would have found that there 
were only four settlements in 1978, and these were very small. 
  Today there are 180 settlements and they are all very large. 
The settlement issue is not an easy one, but very difficult. We 
were late in agreeing to start of the peace negotiations. 
  [Karam] What are the effects of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre on the Cairo agreement? Some people are saying that 
this agreement is finished now that the failure of the Israeli 
protection for it has been shown? 
  [Mubarak] The Cairo agreement was an affirmation of some 
principles of the Oslo agreement. We negotiated here to resolve 
the details of the issues and were almost finished. I expect 
the negotiations to resume soon, once things calm down, and that 
the parties will sign the agreement. 
  I do not pay attention to statements and rumors that come 
from here or there. The one making a statement might want to 
sow unrest between the Palestinians and Israelis so that they 
will become more intransigent. But we are fully conscious of 
this. I tell the Palestinians: Get a foothold first, and then 
make further demands. Today the Palestinians are talking while 
they are outside their territories. When I am on the outside, 
my words are weaker than when I am speaking on the inside. 
  [Karam] Are you happy with the Palestinian coordination 
with the Arab sides directly concerned with the peace 
negotiations? Egypt, and you personally, played a major role in 
bringing the PLO closer to Syria and Jordan. 
  [Mubarak] There must be cooperation and coordination. I have 
a mission to carry out, namely: unity. 
  [Karam] If the al-Ibrahmi Mosque massacre is not enough -- 
as 
seems to be the case judging by Israeli statements -- to gain 
vital concessions during the negotiations, do the Palestinians 
still have a chance to make better gains and to overcome the 
breaches in the Oslo and Cairo agreements, and how? 
  [Mubarak] I hope that some of the existing problems will be 
solved. The two sides are discussing the details of the 
agreement; there is no real problem. We have made a big stride. 
  [Karam] Why is no Arab summit being held to deal with the 
Arab situation, and what are the real obstacles impeding the 
convening of such a summit? 
  [Mubarak] We do not do not have an Arab summit absolutely 
every year. Arab divisions after the invasion and occupation of 
Kuwait caused a split in the Arab world. 
  At the same time, we see that Abu-'Ammar has visited Saudi 
Arabia to perform the minor pilgrimage. I expect that King 
Husayn will make a similar visit. I have talked with brother 
King Fahd concerning Abu-'Ammar and King Husayn. But when I 
talk with King Fahd, some people think that I am trying to turn 
him against them. This is absolutely untrue. I contact Arab 
brothers and the outside world to serve the Arab nation. I also 
managed to bring the views of Presidents Clinton and al-Asad 
closer. 
  [Karam] The Arab delegations have suspended their 
participation in the peace talks in protest of the al-Ibrahimi 
massacre. And now that Egypt has asked the UN Security Council 
to form an committee to investigate the massacre, what, in your 
opinion, should be done to resume the negotiations and to end 
the stalemate engulfing them in order to reach a real, 
all-embracing, just, and comprehensive peace? And are we still 
likely to see the real beginning of peace in 1994? 
  [Mubarak] I am confident that this year will see the real 
beginning of peace. The delay in the peace negotiations is 
regrettable. The Arab countries did not ask for a suspension of 
the negotiations. Rather they asked for a postponement of the 
negotiations in consideration of Palestinian feelings. Everyone 
demands peace. 
  We cannot give up on peace because of the massacre, for this 
would mean the triumph of brute force. We condemn this massacre 
and we demand that measures be adopted to prevent any similar 
massacres. But it is inadmissible to stop the peace process 
because of this massacre. 
  [Karam] Do you see any links between the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre in Hebron and the Sayyidat al-Najat Church 
massacre in Lebanon? 
  [Mubarak] I do not have enough information about these two 
massacres, but both are tragedies. 
  [Karam] What do you believe is the ideal solution for the 
future of Bosnia-Herzegovina and for ending the Muslims' tragedy 
there? What role must the United Nations and the big Western 
powers play to deal with this crisis? Will the intervention of 
NATO speed up the solution, and in whose favor? 
  [Mubarak] All I can say here is that the isolation of the 
Muslims in a state on their own is wrong and dangerous. The 
Muslims and Christians must coexist within the framework of 
their state. 
  [Karam] It is known that you are a great media man. What 
role do you feel the Arab media should play at this extremely 
crucial and sensitive stage in the life of the Arab nation? 
  [Mubarak] I ask the Arab media at this point in time to be 
realistic and accurate in their reports, because communications 
in the world are now very fast. The Arab media should do this 
to avoid harming the Arab nation. 
  Let us be realistic, moderate, logical, and intelligent in 
our media, whether in presenting our causes or discussing 
problems. 
  [Karam] Do you believe the Arab world will emerge from the 
narrow definitions that have been set for it -- namely, that it 
belongs to the Third World? 
  [Mubarak] If the Arab countries could cooperate with each 
other on firm and strong bases, and if we could do away with the 
spirit of scheming and aggression against each other and give up 
ideas of intervening in each other's affairs, we could become a 
strong, gigantic entity.

  [Text] Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], president of the 
state of Palestine and chairman of the PLO Executive Committee, 
has stressed the need to hold elections in the occupied 
territories within three months, adding that this depends on 
Israel's approval. 
  In a statement to DPA broadcast yesterday, President 
Abu-'Ammar urged the Security Council to quickly adopt a 
resolution condemning the massacre, which claimed the lives of a 
number of Palestinian worshipers in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in 
the occupied West Bank city of Hebron. 
  Brother Abu-'Ammar said providing security for the 
frightened 
and infuriated sons of the homeland in the occupied territories 
is more important than other issues. Brother President 
Abu-'Ammar described Israel's refusal to renegotiate the already 
signed agreements as an attempt to gain time. He added that the 
Israelis are playing tactical games and are not willing to 
provide anything tangible.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Need for Progress on the F-16 Deal"] </F>
  [Text] There seems to be a move on the part of the US 
administration to enable Pakistan to take delivery of the F-16 
aircraft, apparently 38 in number, which it has already paid for 
with a sum of over $700 million. The hitch, so far, has been an 
overly broad application of the Pressler Amendment under which 
US military and economic assistance to Pakistan has been cut off 
since 1990 on the grounds that the US president has been unable 
to certify that Pakistan was not in possession of a nuclear 
device nor in the process of acquiring one. But the aircraft 
have been paid for out of Pakistan's own funds and the deal 
simply should not be subjected to restrictions under this 
amendment. However the Congress and, till fairly recently, the 
US administration appeared quite content to use this amendment 
in order to deny the aircraft to Pakistan and to increase 
pressure on it to roll back its nuclear programme. In the face 
of Pakistan's refusal to oblige, the US administration appears 
to be taking a different tack. It now seems to be inclined to 
convince the congress of the merits of allowing Pakistan to 
supplement its strength in conventional arms in order to provide 
it greater incentive for not undertaking a nuclear weapons 
programme. Clearly the latter issue pertains to the country's 
perceived security needs and it is for Pakistan to determine 
whether it should keep its options open in this context. 
  To the extent that the reported move by the US 
administration 
provides some hope that Pakistan will be able to get what it has 
paid for is an encouraging development. However, there are all 
kinds of lobbies within the US political and governmental 
circles that have been active in trying to block the move by 
whatever means necessary regardless of the merits of the case. 
Meanwhile India has also sought to influence the matter with its 
prime minister observing in this regard that if the aircraft 
were indeed to be delivered to Pakistan then his country will 
also be forced to review its defence requirements. Considering 
India's vast superiority in arms over Pakistan this is a 
completely untenable argument. In response to informal US 
proposals regarding nuclear non-proliferation and resumption of 
limited military and economic assistance reportedly received by 
the government Pakistan should make its position clear both in 
terms of its legitimate security requirements as well as the 
importance on the part of the US to meet its obligations under 
generally recognised principles governing transactions such as 
the F-16 deal. The prime minister's meeting with the U.S. 
ambassador on Sunday was probably meant to convey Pakistan's 
growing impatience on this issue to the United States 
government. The upcoming visit of the chief of the army staff 
to the US should also help clarify Pakistan's stand. If the US 
still appears prone to hedge on the matter then perhaps the 
government will have little choice but to continue to withhold 
further payments and take the matter to court in the United 
States as it is reportedly contemplating.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hizballah Deputy Secretary General Shaykh </F>
Na'im Qasim by Muhammad Shuqayr in Beirut; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Shuqayr] There are reports that Hizballah 
took control of Ba'labakk throughout the demonstration [staged 
on international Jerusalem Day] in return for the internal 
security forces' withdrawal. 
  [Qasim] Jerusalem Day is a well-known annual day which we 
celebrate every year. Actually we staged a symbolic unarmed 
parade. It is untrue that there were no security forces there. 
There was a security cordon around Ba'labakk in cooperation with 
the security forces in anticipation of any emergency, especially 
after the talk of possible bombings or security infiltrations. 
The symbolic parade was clear to everyone, and it was unarmed. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Shuqayr] There are reports that Hizballah took the state's 
place and assumed the task of maintaining security in Ba'labakk. 
  [Qasim] You can ask internal security forces whether or not 
we prevented anyone, and whether or not they performed their 
duties. I can confirm that everything some media services said 
is untrue. And that some quarters tried to put the spotlight on 
us to conceal other quarters. These quarters were behind the 
release of some erroneous reports. 
  [Shuqayr] Are we to understand that the measures were taken 
in coordination with security forces? 
  [Qasim] Security forces are responsible for security, 
anyhow. [passage omitted] 
  [Shuqayr] It is said that Hizballah acted in Ba'labakk as 
though it is under the resistance's control. 
  [Qasim] There are no problems in Ba'labakk that require 
extraordinary measures. This is why matters were normal and 
will remain so. No comparison should be made between Ba'labakk, 
which is under state control, and other areas said to have a 
link with some of the bombings that have taken place. Matters 
are normal in Ba'labakk. As for the areas where there are 
bombings and dangers to citizens, it is natural to have 
precautionary measures to prevent them from happening. Such 
measures were taken in the al-Ghubayrah area when an explosive 
charge was discovered in a school two days ago, and in other 
areas as well. 
  In principle, there is no need to take extraordinary 
measures 
except in the areas that need it. As for whether the measures 
were fair or exaggerated, this requires a discussion of the 
details and the circumstances. It is not true at all that we 
acted as an authority in Ba'labakk. We do not take any measures 
that should be taken by the state. Our fight is limited to the 
South and western al-Biqa' against the Israeli enemy. But to 
have discipline in Ba'labakk as a result of Hizballah's 
extensive popular presence is a positive factor which spares the 
competent agencies extraordinary measures. [passage omitted] 
  [Shuqayr] Some people say that Lebanese Forces leader Samir 
Ja'ja' was cornered and the demonstration came to rescue him. 
  [Qasim] Jerusalem Day is marked annually, and the parade was 
not armed. Anyone who wants to look for excuses to conceal 
matters or justify something can easily discover or justify 
anything he wants. If there had been no Jerusalem Day, the talk 
would have been about suppression of freedoms, sectarian 
imbalance, and other matters. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mr. Mohammadi, spokesman of our country's Foreign 
Ministry, has expressed profound dismay about remarks made by an 
official of the Saudi Arabian Government, adding that the 
official's remarks were hypocritical and in contravention of 
Islamic customs. 
  Mr. Mohammadi has stressed: The Islamic Republic of Iran is 
cohesively supporting the expansion of good relations and 
peaceful coexistence with Islamic countries such as Saudi 
Arabia. However, this trend cannot be one-sided. What must be 
viewed as a reality is the presence of contradictions and 
ambiguities in the behavior of the Saudi statesmen; a behaviour 
for which one cannot find any justification except the 
intervention of the foreigners. 
  The Islamic Reublic of Iran fully supports the 
implementation 
of the agreement between the foreign ministers of both countries 
reached in Oman after the conclusion of the 17th session of the 
meeting between the Islamic countries' foreign ministers. On 
the basis of the same agreement, the Islamic Republic of Iran 
has proposed negotiations between high-ranking delegations from 
both countries, with the aim of making the implementation of the 
agreement possible during this year's Hajj. So far, however, 
Iran has unfortunately faced contradictory postures and 
procrastinations from the other side. This constitutes a fact 
which is denied in the remarks made by the Saudi official.

  [Text] Cairo, 17 Mar (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General 
Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid today received a written message from 
Faruq Qaddumi, the head of the PLO's Political Department. The 
message concerns the latest developments in the talks with 
Israel in light of Arab moves to ensure security for the 
Palestinians in the occupied territories, disarm the settlers, 
and obtain a Security Council resolution condemning the Israeli 
massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. This can be achieved by 
providing international protection and by tangible measures by 
the Israelis to ensure security for the Palestinians. 
  Sa'id Kamal, the Palestinian ambassador in Cairo, noted that 
he and Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid discussed U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
recent remarks about the status of Jerusalem. He noted that the 
Arab League secretary general promised to take the necessary 
measures to back the Palestinian side should the talks with 
Israel resume, especially with regard to the call for disbanding 
the settlements and not recognizing Israel's measures on 
Jerusalem. 
  Kamal added that he briefed Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid on the recent 
contacts held between PLO officials and Arab and international 
officials, including the foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria, and 
Lebanon. He pointed out that these contacts dealt with the 
future of the Middle East peace process following the massacre. 
He noted that a meeting among officials from the cordon states 
[Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt and the PLO] is likely to be 
held on the sidelines of the Arab League ministerial meeting in 
Cairo on 26 March.

<F P=106> [News conference by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Prime </F>
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin with unidentified reporters at the White 
House; in English -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Rabin] Mr. President, the 
vice president, secretary of state, dear friends. It was 
important and worthwhile to meet today with the President and 
his team to know and appreciate what we have known for a long 
time: The friendship and trust between our two countries are 
profound and are as good -- if not better -- than they have ever 
been. We could not ask for more. For this, Mr. President, 
please accept our gratitude. It is good to know that a great 
nation, blessed with values and democracy, stands with us for 
the greatest battle still to come -- the battle for peace. 
  Mr. President, a few months ago I stood here with you and 
many others at an historic occasion. We arrived at the 
beginning of the end of the bloody struggle that has lasted for 
100 years. It was clear from the beginning that in spite of the 
goodwill on all sides, it would be difficult to bridge in days 
or in months differences in positions, perceptions, points of 
view, and hatred that have devastated and grown over so many 
decades. But we shall overcome these difficulties and reach the 
day of peace. We shall remain determined in our goal. 
  In our talks today I told you, Mr. President, that in my 
view 
we were near the finish line of the talks with the Palestinians 
on the first stage of the Gaza-Jericho First. Some problems and 
details have yet to be solved. I am sure that we shall find the 
right solution once the negotiations are renewed. We will not 
let the extremists derail the peace process. 
  On behalf of the State of Israel, I condemn the terrible 
terms of the killing in Hebron. I repeated this today in our 
conversation. Since that time, the Government of Israel has 
taken tough measures that are unprecedented in Israel. We will 
implement them with determination. 
  But, Mr. President, we are also victims of terror -- whether 
organized or spontaneous. Our women and children have lived in 
the shadow of terror for decades. Not a week passes that we 
don't have to bury our dead. And if only for this reason, we 
don't think it appropriate to raise new demands after every 
terrorist attack. Security is a two-way street. Real leadership 
must rise above the realities of the day, even if they are 
painful and bloody, in order to arrive at our strategic goal. 
Peace is not a tactical option but a strategic objective which 
takes precedence over everything else. 
  With you, Mr. President, I call on Chairman 'Arafat of the 
PLO to resume talks immediately and act like me: to fight 
terror as if there were no negotiations and conduct the 
negotiation as if there was no terror. 
  We have to complete the negotiations so that in the spring 
or 
early summer hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of 
Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho will at last be able to conduct 
their own affairs. We don't seek to rule them any more. 
  Mr. President, there is no time to waste. We feel that the 
window of opportunity that opened after the Gulf War is narrower 
than we thought. Time is running out. Therefore, 1994 has to 
be the year of great decisions in the peace process. In this 
framework, we spoke of the options that can be presented to 
President al-Asad in order to achieve peace with Syria. I hope 
that President al-Asad will respond appropriately, and we shall 
be able to sign a peace treaty by the end of this year. 
President al-Asad said that Syria had made a strategic choice 
for peace with Israel. That was encouraging. Peace with Syria 
has always been our strategic choice. We recognize the 
importance of Syria to a comprehensive peace in the area. We 
are ready to negotiate peace with Syria that takes account of 
our mutual needs and interests. There must be give and take on 
both sides. We know that as we engage in serious and 
authoritative negotiations, the point will come where painful 
decisions will have to be made. The promise of peace and its 
genuine benefits for all Israelis justifies making such 
decisions vis-a-vis Syria. We will not compromise on our 
security, but we will stand ready to do what is required of us 
if the Syrians are ready to do what is required of them. 
  At the same time, we would like to promote and advance the 
negotiations with Jordan, as well as with Lebanon. We are 
hopeful that with them, too, treaties of peace can be achieved 
this year. All of us know that time for the Arab boycott of 
Israel -- a remnant of a period of hate and rejection -- should 
be lifted. 
  Mr. President, prime ministers of Israel had come in the 
past 
with impressive shopping lists. On my list today I have one 
item alone: the pursuit of peace. As Passover -- our feast of 
freedom -- is approaching, let me take the opportunity to remind 
all of us of the fate of the Israeli soldiers missing in action 
and prisoners of war. I would like to thank the President for 
the United States' support in this regard and express the hope 
that Passover will also be a time of redemption for them. Mr. 
President, thank you very much. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Prime Minister, you said that 
security is a two-way street. What do you plan to do to wipe 
out the acknowledged double standard in the treatment of the 
Palestinians, and also, if you are willing to make peace with 
Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, now why don't you make the quantum 
leap and go for permanent negotiations on peace with 
Palestinians, instead of the step-by-step, very slow struggle of 
the peace process that means more strife? 
  [Rabin] First, about the second question. You have to refer 
to the letter of invitation to the Madrid peace conference. 
This letter of invitation served as the basis agreed on by all 
the parties that were invited to the Madrid peace conference and 
the negotiations that followed this conference. What was 
written there? That the purpose of the negotiations with the 
three neighboring Arab countries beyond Egypt would be to 
achieve peace treaties, and with the Palestinians to move by two 
phases. Phase number one: Something that was never offered to 
the Palestinians in the past, not by Jordan when Jordan was in 
occupation of the West Bank, not by Egypt when Egypt was in 
occupation of the Gaza Strip. We offered them self-rule, to run 
their own affairs, to have a Palestinian council, self-governing 
authority, as an interim agreement. What was agreed in signing 
between the PLO and us? In the Declaration of Principles [DOP] 
that was signed on the lawn of the White House we divided the 
phases by agreement to Gaza-Jericho First, then to create the 
overall arrangement, and not later than two years after the 
completion of the implementation of Gaza-Jericho First to start 
negotiating a permanent solution. I believe that sometimes what 
might look the shortest way is the longest and the one that will 
not lead to a change in the realities. Therefore, we are 
committed to the letter of invitation to the Madrid peace 
conference; we are committed to the Declaration of Principles 
that were signed here between the PLO and Israel; we are 
committed to the Cairo agreement that was reached between the 
PLO and Israel, and I believe, to be committed to agreements 
that were reached is a basic precondition for the efforts to 
reach more agreements in the past. [as heard] 
  Second, you talked about different situations. Let's face 
it, most of the terror attacks are aimed against Israelis. We, 
the Government of Israel, in accordance to the international 
law, are the sovereign to military government of the 
territories. It's our responsibility for the safety, the 
welfare of all the residents, Jews and Palestinians alike. This 
government, as a result of the terrible tragedy that took place 
in Hebron, has taken measures that are unprecedented in Israel 
vis-a-vis those who violate the law, but we are a lawful 
country. I can give you an example. I use my responsibility as 
a minister of defense: orders for administrative detention of 
two Israeli residents, not [from] the territories, but in 
accordance to our laws, they had to be approved by a president 
of a district court. I ordered administrative detention for 
three months. The president of the district court reduced it to 
six days. I cannot violate verdicts of the court. Whatever the 
government does comes under the supervision and decision of our 
courts. I believe that many people in Israel believe that 
[what] we have done almost encroaching the line of the law, but 
we are determined to do within the law whatever is needed to 
fight terrorist from whatever direction it will come. 
  [Unidentified Israeli reporter] The two most sensitive 
issues, Jerusalem and settlements, are now de facto on the 
table. Do you agree that they should wait until the final 
stage, or should you tackle them right now? I am asking both of 
you, Mr. President and Mr. Prime minister. [passage omitted] 
  [Rabin] My answer is basically simple. We signed here in 
Washington the Declaration of Principles. It is written very 
clearly there that issues that have to be settled once we'll 
negotiate a permanent solution will not be dealt with now, and 
it is written very clearly, as examples for this kind of issues: 
Jerusalem, settlements, borders, refugees, and others. 
Therefore, by agreement with the PLO, these issues will be 
dealt with when we'll negotiate a permanent solution. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Unidentified U.S. correspondent] I am wondering if you 
could describe what your view is of the concrete measures that 
you mentioned earlier on in your remarks that should be taken to 
keep peace in Israel, and whether or not you would support the 
PLO idea for a police force in Hebron? [passage omitted] 
  [Rabin] Allow me first to make it clear, in the agreement, 
once it will be reached and signed, there is a building [as 
heard] -- in the past it was 8,000 to 9,000 men -- the 
Palestinian police force in Gaza and Jericho. If by now 
agreement has been reached, by now there would have been 
8,000-9,000 Palestinian policemen in Gaza and Jericho. The more 
negotiations are postponed, the longer it will take them to 
come. Second, even if there will be some Palestinian police, 
and there were in the past, at least 900 Palestinian police in 
the territories were Palestinian residents of the territories in 
Hebron and in Ramallah and in Nabulus. They resigned because of 
the intifada. As long as ours is the overall responsibility for 
the territories under the military government, using our Civil 
Administration, their presence will not relieve us from our 
overall responsibility. Therefore, we have to look at it in the 
context of what is our international and practical 
responsibility. We, as long as agreement will not be reached 
that will cover all these areas with the PLO, we will remain 
internationally responsible to the security of all those who 
reside there. If there will be or will not be part of any 
Palestinian police, they have to come under the control of the 
government there, and the government is the military government 
of Israel. Therefore, you can't have separate armed groups. 
There must be one chain of command of those who have to keep 
and maintain law and order. [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, do you think 
that Jews should exercise their right to reside in the middle of 
Arab cities, and Mr. Prime Minister, could you also respond to 
that? 
  [Rabin] What? 
  [Clinton] What was the question? 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Do you think, should Jews 
exercise their right to reside in the middle of Arab cities in 
the West Bank? Should they live in Hebron, for instance? 
  [Rabin] I don't understand the question. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Well, there were ideas of 
evacuating Jews from the middle of Hebron, for instance. 
  [Rabin] Again, as part of the DOP that we signed with the 
PLO, it is said very clearly that the settlements remain there 
for the interim period. I am not saying it; it is written very 
clearly in the DOP. Therefore, since it was agreed, I don't see 
at this stage as a condition for anything even to discuss this 
issue. [sentence as heard] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, I wonder if you 
could tell us, and Mr. Prime Minister, the extent to which you 
have discussed the Jonathan Pollard case again, and how much, if 
at all, the Ames investigation has interfered with action on it 
that was presented as imminent several months ago? [passage 
omitted] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Could the prime minister answer 
that? 
  [Rabin] In today's meeting, the issue was not brought up. 
Thank you.

  [Text] Sanaa, 16 Mar (MENA)--It was learned here today that 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], one of the ruling coalition 
parties in Yemen, used tanks and artillery in the Shabwah 
Governorate, one of the southern governorates, to surround the 
governorate headquarters and the Security Directorate 
headquarters to force Governor Dirham 'Abduh Nu'man, member of 
the General People's Congress General Committee, and Colonel 
Ahmad 'Ali Muhsin, the governorate security director and leading 
member of the General People's Congress in the governorate, to 
leave the governorate immediately. 
  The governor and the security director received from the 
military commander, who belongs to the YSP led by 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, and the YSP secretary in the governorate an urgent 
ultimatum to immediately leave their workplace in the 
governorate or they would be driven out by military force. It 
is worth noting that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is the 
General People's Congress secretary general in Yemen.

  [Text] Sanaa, 17 Mar (INA)--Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid 
al-Zindani, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council, has 
warned against a foreign and Zionist scheme to partition Yemen 
into several statelets in order to make it easier to control its 
oil wealth and strategic location, especially the strait of Bab 
el Mandeb in the Red Sea. 
  In statements before Yemeni military units broadcast today, 
al-Zindani stressed that the scheme to divide Yemen aims at 
establishing several statelets by inciting tribal and sectarian 
dissension and paralyzing the state's official institutions in 
order to drag the Yemeni people into infighting. 
  He said this scheme is part of a colonialist course that 
targets not just Yemen, but every Arab attempt to forge a better 
future in the region. He indicated that anti-Arab foreign 
forces do not want to see Arabs and Muslims become capable of 
making any advancement and seek to render them desperate about 
any chances of progress. 
  He recalled that the West wagered on fighting among the 
parties to the Yemeni coalition immediately after the elections, 
especially between the Islamists -- the Yemeni Reform Grouping 
-- and the Yemeni Socialist Party. 
  Al-Zindani revealed that one of the objectives of the 
foreign 
scheme against Yemen is to control or lease the strait of Bab el 
Mandeb and to establish weak statelets. He indicated that when 
the Yemenis are unified and strong, foreign powers find it 
extremely difficult to impose their humiliating conditions. 
  The statements by al-Zindani, who is a prominent member of 
the Yemeni Reform Grouping under Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn 
al-Ahmar, are part of the warnings that the grouping issued to 
the General People's Congress and the Yemeni Socialist Party on 
the gravity of the continued crisis and its effects on the 
future of Yemen's unity.

<F P=106> [Report by Hammud Munsir: "Al-Ahmar's Son Escapes </F>
Assassination Attempt in Ambush Near Sanaa"] 
  [Excerpt] Sanaa -- Shaykh Husayn 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, son of 
Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, speaker of the Yemeni 
House of Representatives, chairman of the Higher Committee of 
the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG], and chieftain of the Hashid 
tribes, escaped an assassination attempt at 0900 yesterday as he 
was returning to Sanaa from the northern Khamr region, 
considered to be the main center of the Hashid tribes. Only one 
of his guards was wounded in the attempt. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, a source close to 
Shaykh 
al-Ahmar said the attempt occurred in an ambush on the northern 
road outside the town of 'Umran 60 km from Sanaa when the car of 
a group of tribal gunmen intercepted and collided with the first 
car in Shaykh al-Ahmar's motorcade which had already overtaken 
it. 
  As the motorcade continued its journey with the shaykh's car 
between two guard cars, a hail of bullets rained on the 
motorcade from both sides of the road. The guards returned fire 
and although the attackers concentrated their fire on the 
shaykh's Mercedes, he was not hurt at all and the attackers fled. 
  The attempt does not seem to have any political significance 
and is not linked to the current Yemeni crisis. There is 
speculation that it might be related to tribal differences. The 
source said that all members of the attacking group were 
identified as tribal men but he did not say to which tribes they 
belonged. He said that they were not from the area where the 
incident occurred and that they came from other areas. [passage

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Algeria: Justice, Interior, and </F>
Defense Ministries Trade Accusations Over Tazoult Operation"] 
  [Excerpts] Tazoult (Algeria), AL-HAYAH -- The committee 
investigating the attack on Tazoult prison in Batna Wilaya 
completed its field investigations yesterday and returned to the 
Algerian capital. 
  President Major General Liamine Zeroual is expected to 
address the nation in a few days to announce "crucial decisions" 
in the light of the committee's report and other factors. It 
was striking yesterday that the Justice, Defense, and Interior 
Ministries, of which the investigation committee is comprised, 
accused one another of negligence -- which led to the production 
of three reports, instead of one. 
  Military units continued their combing operations in search 
of some 900 prisoners who escaped when scores of gunmen attacked 
Tazoult prison last Thursday. 
  AL-HAYAH yesterday saw scores of wounded escaped prisoners 
who were moved to Aress Hospital (50 km east of Batna) after the 
security forces pursuing them had shot them. Explosions were 
heard in the mountains and helicopters were seen flying over the 
area. It has been learned that the combing operations have been 
moved to Batna city itself, including the university campus and 
the area around it. As is known, the area is Maj. Gen. 
Zeroual's birthplace. 
  Reliable sources have told AL-HAYAH that the investigation 
committee comprises nine members representing the Justice, 
Defense, and Interior Ministries. The committee recorded 
"important observations" about the negligence that took place 
before and during the attack on the prison. [passage omitted] 
  It is not ruled out that measures may be taken against 
officials at the three ministries at various levels. One source 
expressed amazement at the inclusion of the director of the 
Justice Ministry Prisons Department in the committee, especially 
as he is one of those accused of negligence. The source also 
accuses the Defense Ministry of failing to carry out its duties. 
He also stresses that Justice Minister Mohamed Taguia informed 
all parties of the matter but they did not carry out their 
duties. 
  AL-HAYAH has learned that the regime has opened the Justice 
Ministry file and discovered that "high-level circles at the 
ministry are accused of bribery and favoritism." These 
accusations are based on "firm evidence" to a large extent 
linked to what happened in Tazoult prison and other prisons. It 
has been learned that the investigation committee also recorded 
the disappearance of Minister Taguia and his senior aides during 
the four-hour attack on Tazoult, and none of them went to the 
site.

  [Text] The Public Relations Department of the General 
Directorate of the Internal Security Forces issued the following 
statement today: 
  Subsequent to an earlier statement by the General 
Directorate 
of the Internal Security Forces about the assault on Monsignor 
Ilyas al-Habr in Sayyidat al-Intiqal [Our Lady of the 
Assumption] Church, the Greek Catholic sect's church in 
al-Ashrafiyah, this is to report that it just so happens that 
the two arrested suspects Faris Philip al-Hajj, born in Harat 
Hurayk in 1950, currently residing in [place-name indistinct]; 
and Nabil Ptikoyan, born in al-Hadath in 1965 and currently 
resident of al-Jummayzah, are Lebanese Forces members. They 
constituted a two-man [word indistinct] in al-Shahruri Barracks 
in al-Ashrafiyah. Investigations continue. 
  A former statement by the directorate announced that 
Muhammad 
al-Hajj 'Ali, born in 1971 and currently resident of Tariq 
al-Jadidah was also involved in the incident and indeed is owner 
of the vehicle used in the assault.

  [Text] A responsible source in the Lebanese Forces has 
commented on the statement issued by the General Directorate of 
the Internal Security Forces on the arrest of Faris Philip 
al-Hajj and Nabil (Krikorian) as follows: 
  The Lebanese Forces would like to point out the following: 
  1. Around 150,000 personnel joined the Lebanese Forces 
departments between 1977 and 1991, the year the militias were 
disbanded. The Lebanese Forces have no proof that the two 
suspects joined any of its administrative departments. 
  2. The Lebanese Forces started to keep records of its 
personnel in 1981 but these two names have appeared in none of 
the Forces' records. So the Lebanese Forces categorically deny 
that the two suspects have been among its members at any time 
since 1981. 
  The Forces strongly condemn the crimes committed by the two, 
including plunder, robbery, and assault against a clergyman, and 
calls on the Lebanese judiciary to hand down the maximum 
punishment on them and on others who commit similar acts, even 
Lebanese Forces members. The Lebanese Forces would like to draw 
the public's attention to some malicious campaigns that seek to 
serve political goals that are known to everybody.

  [Text] Tripoli, al Rabia'a [March] 15, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS 
AGENCY -- The INDIAN NEWS AGENCY said that Malcolm Ronil, the 
director of missile operations in the American Defence 
Department expressed his country's concern at the development of 
what he called `missile programmes' in seven countries: India, 
North Korea, Pakistan, Iran, Libya, Syria, and Iraq. The agency 
cited the official as saying that a ballistic missiles programme 
in these countries constitutes a serious threat to American 
national interests. 
  The international affairs editor of the JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS 
AGENCY, commenting on this said that these statements once more 
expose a series of facts, the most important that, - they are 
levelled against countries which are neither Christian nor 
Jewish. This is new proof of plans by the Jewish-Christian 
alliance against Islam and other non Jewish and non Christian 
religions, specifically Confucianism and Buddhism. This can be 
seen given that these statements do not at all mention the 
nuclear arsenal which the Israelis have, an arsenal including 
200 nuclear warheads, which the Israelis have publicly declared 
to have in their possession. No one has called for the 
destruction of these weapons nor has anyone expressed concern 
about their existence. However, the reason is obvious, namely 
that there will be no objection to these weapons so long as they 
are aimed at the Arabs, whom, in the eyes of the Christians and 
Jews, are undesirable animals who should be annihilated. 
  The Great Jamahiriyah, one of the countries mentioned by the 
United States has, as a peace loving country, repeatedly 
asserted that it does not have weapons of mass destruction in 
its possession, nor does it even consider them, or owning them. 
Instead, the Great Jamahiriyah is preoccupied with its 
development programme and building a prosperous life for its 
people. Therefore, the continuous repetition of such statements 
which are emanating from the highest American and British 
official levels if [word indistinct] official terrorism by 
nuclear superpowers carried out against a peace loving country 
which is being subjected to unjust harsh measures imposed by 
these countries which dominate the Security Council and obliges 
it to adopt resolutions which serve their best interests and 
their colonialist aims. 
  None of the countries which the American official listed in 
his statement have ever attacked the United States or Britain. 
Indeed, the opposite is true, for these countries have, at 
various times, been the victim of aggression and colonialism 
stemming from these two countries themselves. Thus, these 
countries would normally be expected to think about self defence 
and ways to prevent aggression and colonialism meted out by 
these two western countries who until this day have deployed 
their warships off the shores of these countries in a blatant 
display of provocation and arrogance.

  [Excerpt] London, AL-HAYAH -- Mrs. Baha' al-'Amri, wife of 
former Libyan Foreign Minister Mansur al-Kikhya, sent a letter 
to Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi dated 10/4/1994 
[as published], appealing to him to "find him and return him 
free to his children and home." 
  The letter, a copy of which AL-HAYAH has received, said: "In 
the name of freedom of democracy I writing to you to ask about 
the fate of the Libyan citizen Mansur al-Kikhya, my husband and 
the father of my children and a respectable man who was abducted 
from Egyptian territory. I understand from your recent speech 
that you are seeking to find him because he is a human rights 
case." She went on: "Three months have elapsed and we do not 
know who committed this ugly crime. Maybe cowardly elements 
did, and I am certain that your hands will reach them and that 
you will punish these cowardly people." 
  She also pointed out that Libya "does not wish to lose a 
free 
and noble man who believes in nothing except right, peace, and 
dialogue..., and I am certain that you will find him and return 
him free to his children and home.... You will find him 
anywhere, inside or outside Libya...it does not matter...what 
matters is for him to come back to his children, who have not 
stopped crying." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Rabin Will Not Bargain on Israel's Security!!!"] </F>
  [Text] This large-scale diplomatic and political activity 
on Israel's part toward the United States and its allies may 
prevent the UN Security Council from adopting a just resolution 
on the massacre at holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's visit to Washington 
and his meetings with President Clinton and his staff are an 
escalation of this Israeli activity. This is especially so 
since Rabin's visit coincides with the date set by the Security 
Council to adopt its resolution on the massacre at the holy 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque. Yitzhaq Rabin is depending totally on the 
U.S. to prevent the UN Security Council from adopting a decisive 
resolution that secures protection for the Palestinian people 
from the Zionist settlers and the oppression of the Israeli 
occupation soldiers. 
  It is well known that the U.S. role to date has prevented 
the 
Security Council from adopting such a resolution. What is worse 
is that Yitzhaq Rabin declared in Washington that he is not 
willing to commit himself to any UN resolution that contradicts 
Israel's intentions. He rejects sending a UN peace-keeping 
force to the occupied Palestinian territories. He also refuses 
to evacuate the settlements and disarm the settlers. 
  What is even worse is Rabin's statement that Israel will not 
bargain over its security!!! Meanwhile, the security of the 
Palestinian people, including women, children, and the elderly, 
is not important to Rabin and his government. 
  Yitzhaq Rabin is turning the equation upside down. He is 
demanding security for the Israelis and the terrorist settlers 
instead of committing himself to protecting the Palestinian 
people under the wicked Israeli occupation. 
  The U.S. Administration, in the first place, and the big 
influential countries in the UN Security Council, in the second 
place, should adopt a just resolution that forces Israel to 
abandon its intransigence, accept the formation of an 
international force to protect the Palestinian people, and agree 
to evacuate the settlements and disarm the settlers. Otherwise, 
the peace process, which these countries are concerned about, 
will come to a crossroads with no clear directions or become 
permanently paralyzed. 
  The peace desired by the Palestinians and the Arabs is not 
just any kind of peace. A peace that is established at the 
expense of the Palestinian people, who are facing campaigns of 
containment and annihilation, is no peace at all.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Security Council is Exacerbating the Security </F>
Situation in the Region"] 
  [Text] Once again, the U.S. Administration and its NATO 
allies are interfering in the UN Security Council to prevent it 
from adopting a resolution to lift the unjust embargo on 
fraternal Iraq. Once again, the U.S. Administration has revealed 
its blatant hostility toward Iraq and the entire Arab nation. 
  It is also clear that deeply ingrained grudges are behind 
maintaining the embargo on the people and children of Iraq in 
order to starve them and allow serious diseases to destroy 
hundreds of thousands of them. 
  Since Iraq was totally committed to implementing many 
Security Council resolutions and cooperated with UN inspection 
teams to destroy their advanced strategic weapons, the Security 
Council member states could not find anything with which to 
justify their stand that is hostile to the people of Iraq and to 
validate the nonlifting of the unjust embargo on its sons and 
children. So, they armed themselves with false and baseless 
pretexts. 
  The Security Council has proven, once again, that it is 
using 
double standards in dealing with international issues and that 
it is a tool devoted to serving the U.S. stand at the expense of 
persecuted and oppressed peoples. 
  This exposed double standards in the Security Council's 
practices made it lose the confidence of nations and peoples of 
the world it. 
  Therefore, Iraq had no other choice but to signal that it 
will reconsider its method of dealing with the Security Council 
and will resort to whatever could save its people and children 
from possible perdition if the embargo on it continues. 
  It seems that Iraq is about to lose its patience toward the 
UN Security Council's stands and the role of the influential big 
countries in it. Moreover, it may resort to any stand that is 
not within the calculations of the U.S. Administration and its 
allies or within the calculations of the spiteful ones who 
continue to seek revenge from the the people of Iraq. 
  From this premise, one can say that the U.S. Administration 
and its allies should reconsider their calculations, review 
their stand on the embargo, and seek to end it in order to avoid 
any developments with untold consequences.

  [Text] Israel will not agree to reopen the Oslo and Cairo 
agreements. This transpires from Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's 
letter to Rabbi 'Ovadya Yosef. Our party affairs correspondent 
Yaron Deqel obtained a version of the letter, which paved the 
way for SHAS' [Torah Observing Sephardim] return to the 
government. These are the four points that Rabin promised SHAS: 
The Declaration of Principles with the Palestinians and the 
Cairo agreement will not be reopened for negotiations; Jerusalem 
will remain the united capital of Israel and under complete 
Israeli sovereignty. Rabin also promised Rabbi Yosef not to 
compromise with the Palestinians on the right of return, except 
for cases of family reunification, and that any peace agreement 
involving a return of territory will be brought for a public 
decision by means of a referendum or elections. 
  Rafi Edri, who is directing the negotiations with SHAS on 
behalf of Labor, submitted the coalition agreement with SHAS as 
well as the letter to Rabbi 'Ovadya Yosef to the Knesset's table.

  [Text] In a telephone interview by Mikha Friedman earlier 
this morning, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres was asked to 
confirm the report we received from Tunis about a forthcoming 
meeting between him and PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat: 
  [Begin recording] [Peres] Right now it is more of a radio 
encounter, because no date for such a meeting has been actually 
set. 
  [Friedman] But a date and a place is being sought, because 
the two of you want to meet. 
  [Peres] It is not a question of our wanting to meet. I 
think the negotiations must be resumed in the appropriate manner 
and with momentum. The Hebron tragedy undoubtedly created a new 
situation which has to be addressed and overcome, and 
conclusions should be drawn from it. 
  [Friedman] Is it true that there is talk of some kind of 
sequential deal under which Israel would be prepared to.... 
  [Peres, interrupting] I do not like the word deal; we do not 
need deals. We would like to address every issue on its value. 
There is a mutual interest in preventing the killing of both 
Arabs and Jews. The present situation is truly intolerable. 
  [Friedman] Is it possible that Shim'on Peres' view that the 
Jewish settlement in the heart of Hebron is detrimental and 
injurious to the peace process may be adopted -- at least in 
part -- and that as a result, all the Jews residing in the heart 
of Arab Hebron will soon be moved to one site? 
  [Peres] What is certain is that we would not discuss such an 
issue with any foreign, non-Israeli element. Israel would have 
to make such a decision alone, independently, taking its own 
factors into consideration. This is not an issue for 
negotiation. At the same time, the way the Jews are sprawled 
out in Hebron is unquestionably awful: We are spread out over 
five sites, one of which is inhabited by eight families, each 
living in a camper. This causes us much concern. Hebron is 
still under curfew, but that is no long-term solution and they 
have been under curfew for a long time already. I regret to say 
that the dream of coexistence between settlers and Palestinians 
received a terrible blow in the Tomb of the Patriarchs. 
  [Friedman] To make your Sunday meeting with 'Arafat 
possible, the government will have to make the decision on 
Hebron sooner than planned. 
  [Peres] I do not know; I do not think one depends on the 
other. 
  [Friedman] Mr. Peres, we disclosed this morning that two IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] bases have been moved from densely 
populated Arab areas in Gaza. I would like to ask you whether 
that is part of our gestures to 'Arafat and part of the 
evacuation and redeployment process, which has started despite 
the absence of a relevant political decision. 
  [Peres] No, that has absolutely nothing to do with the 
negotiations. It has to do with the IDF deployment in the 
Strip. There are places where the IDF is being reinforced and 
others where it is reducing its presence in anticipation of 
future deployment, but these are unilateral Israeli steps. 
  [Friedman] Thank you very much, Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres. 
  [Peres] You are welcome. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has moved two 
bases from densely populated Arab areas in the Gaza Strip to 
other locations. This is part of the IDF's redeployment in 
anticipation of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement with the 
Palestinians. IDF sources stressed that the evacuation of 
troops from refugee camps will be carried out concurrently with 
progress in the talks with the PLO. Our Army affairs 
correspondent Yariv Ben-Yehuda has more details: 
  Two bases have been evacuated within three days -- one in 
Gaza's Rimal neighborhood two days ago, and another, a Border 
Police base in Rafah, which was moved yesterday to the southern 
sector headquarters from which the Border Police will continue 
their operations in the Rafah area in the same scope of 
deployment and activity. Army sources said that in the 
framework of the numerous logistic changes carried out in the 
Gaza Strip recently, buildings and troops have been relocated 
and, in some cases, troops have been concentrated in one central 
location from which they are to continue their operations before 
and after the implementation of autonomy. The sources stressed 
that the volume of the IDF's operations has not changed; on the 
contrary, it has been increased recently, resulting in the 
successful apprehension of many fugitives and the foiling of 
terrorist attacks. The sources further emphasized that the pace 
of troop evacuation from refugee camps will be tied to the 
progress of the talks with the PLO. [passage omitted] 
  The structures from the two evacuated bases will be moved to 
outposts currently under construction near Jewish settlements in 
the Strip. It should be noted that the construction of these 
outposts is at an advanced stage. The IDF preparations for 
redeployment include the imminent transfer of several other 
bases. Defense establishment elements stressed this morning 
that the Gaza and Jericho redeployment can be completed within a 
few weeks after the agreement is signed.

  [Text] Now to the inquiry commission into the massacre of 
Muslims at prayer at a mosque in Hebron's Cave of the 
Patriarchs. David Eppel, who has been listening to the evidence, 
reports here on two new versions of what happened on the morning 
of the crime; versions that surprised the bench and produced 
some intensive cross questioning. 
  [Begin Eppel recording] What exactly were the orders given 
soldiers when Jewish settlers opened fire on Palestinians? Did 
Barukh Goldstein, the killer, carry the standard M-16 assault 
rifle or was it a shortened version of the Galil, the Galon. 
These were the critical questions as the inquiry commission 
probed deeper into the circumstances surrounding the massacre in 
Hebron. If, as four soldiers at the cave claimed in their 
testimony today, Goldstein carried an M-16, it not only 
contradicts the account given by their deputy company commander 
Rotem Ravivi, but the version accepted by everyone until now, 
including the defense establishment. Two of the four soldiers 
said they saw another settler, whom they were unable to 
identify, entering the Cave of the Patriarchs around the same 
time as Goldstein. He, they said, was carrying a Galon, the 
rifle Goldstein was assumed to have used. Other facts emerging 
today concerned shots fired by men on guard duty at the door of 
the Muslim place of worship. Some bullets fired into the air 
also hit the ceiling. Time and again at this afternoon's 
session, the bench wanted to hear from the soldiers giving 
evidence or members of the Tank Corps how they interpreted the 
open-fire orders. And to a man, they said they had been ordered 
not to shoot at Jewish settlers if they were using their guns on 
Palestinians. If they were being shot at, the directive was to 
take cover and try to remove the magazine from the gun. Several 
agreed they considered the order illogical, as they put it, and 
in two instances they expressed their reservations. But beyond 
that, under questioning, they agreed they would obey it even if 
they themselves had come under fire. [end recording] 
  The commission goes into recess this evening and the 
proceedings resume again next week.

<F P=106> [Report by New York correspondent Tzadoq Yehezqeli] </F>
  [Text] Kahana Hay activists have threatened attacks along 
the lines of the Hebron massacre if the Israeli Government does 
not revoke its decision to outlaw their organization. 
  In a statement delivered over the telephone to the local 
YEDI'OT AHARONOT offices on behalf of the organization, which is 
now calling itself "The Unified Command of the Global Uprising," 
the callers mentioned the existence of an underground group for 
the first time. 
  The message said that if the Rabin government does not 
accept 
their ultimatum by Lag B'Omer (29 April), the "`Unit of the God 
of Vengeance,' the military arm of the unified Jewish uprising, 
will follow the example set by the hero and martyr Barukh 
Goldstein." The message also stated that the organization would 
launch violent activities even earlier "if Rabin increases his 
persecution of us or if the Jewish settlers are evacuated from 
Hebron." The group also demanded the immediate release of 
Binyamin Ze'ev Kahana, the leader of Kahana Hay. 
  The sources who delivered the message clarified that the 
attacks would be carried out only against Arabs, not Jews. The 
message also stated that if the ultimatum is rejected, the Arabs 
"will have no respite in this country and the ground will burn 
under their feet day and night, in the streets, their homes, and 
the mosques." 
  According to the callers, supporters of the movement have 
flown to Israel from Europe over the past few days and are now 
operating clandestine cells.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Washington correspondent Nahum Barne'a: "The </F>
Goldstein Tax"] 
  [Text] Yesterday Rabin promised to give the PLO an advance 
payment for the massacre in Hebron. At this stage, we are 
talking about a symbolic payment, about gestures, about Israeli 
measures which will somewhat ease the life of the Arabs in 
Hebron. 
  We are not talking about reopening the Oslo and Cairo 
agreements, pulling the settlers out of Hebron, or deploying an 
international force, as 'Arafat demanded. 
  Perhaps we are talking about lifting the curfew, handing the 
central bus station in Hebron back to the Arabs, giving more 
authority to the qadi in the Cave of the Patriarchs, a plan for 
a Palestinian policing force which would be controlled by Israel 
but would get its authority from the PLO. 
  Of course, this is only the beginning. Rabin promised to 
pay, and Rabin keeps his promises: He will pay. This will be 
the Goldstein tax. 
  The ideas Israel raised to date about the form of payment 
have been rejected by Tunis. They were "nonstarters," just as 
'Arafat's demands were "nonstarters" as far as Rabin was 
concerned. However, the principle was established. The 
Americans will be the ones who will set the final price tag. 
  Half a year ago, on a hot and steamy day, Rabin and 'Arafat 
shook hands on the White House lawn. Then they said the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement would be signed on 13 December. Then 
they put it off to 13 January, and later to 13 April. 
  Yesterday, on a bone-chilling day, Rabin spoke for the first 
time about early summer as the new date for the signing of the 
agreement. 
  When the date of Rabin's visit was set, Israel thought it 
would be the opening shot for practical talks with Syria. 
However, this was not the case, which is also part of the 
Goldstein tax. Last night Rabin confirmed that Israel cannot 
wave the threat of reaching a separate agreement with Syria in 
'Arafat's face. "It would boomerang against us," he said, "the 
Syrians will not show up before the Palestinians return to the 
negotiating table." 
  It was a melancholic visit. 
  The President, who had just returned from an exhausting 
political campaign in New Hampshire, almost fell asleep at the 
podium. Secretary of State Christopher, just back from Asia, 
listened to Rabin's remarks amid a deep slumber. Everybody has 
been through a lot since September, and none of it has been 
good. Rabin said Israeli prime ministers used to come to 
Washington with shopping bags. "The only item in my bag is 
promoting peace," he asserted. 
  Rabin could not say whether he was leaving Washington with a 
full bag. He will have to fill up his bag with goods when he 
gets back home.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: Contrary to the Israeli rulers' normal 
practice when they visit Washington, Yitzhaq Rabin, before 
meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton, said he did not go to 
Washington this time to ask for financial or military aid. 
  Rabin's remark means Israel no longer needs to ask for such 
aid, because this aid has become a routine practice. Successive 
U.S. Administrations have never failed to extend aid to Israel. 
They are so generous that their aid to Israel exceeds that 
extended to any other U.S. ally. This aid has turned Israel 
into the largest military arsenal, with the most sophisticated 
weapon systems, including nuclear arms and weapons of mass 
destruction. 
  The question asks itself: If Rabin did not go to Washington 
to ask for military and financial aid, what did he really want? 
It is not difficult for anyone following events to find the 
answer in the political situation created by the Ibrahimi 
Mosque's massacre in Hebron. This situation halted the 
Washington peace talks segment of the peace process and stopped 
the continued talks between the Rabin government's delegates and 
representatives of the Palestinian side that signed the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  The massacre in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque covered the peace 
process in a flagrant terrorist curtain of blood and fire. It 
offered one more proof of the Israeli rulers' policy to foil the 
peace process and prevent it from advancing one step forward 
after the Madrid conference more than two years ago. 
  Justifications and hollow words meant to calm emotions could 
not save the Rabin government from being held responsible for 
this abominable massacre. Thus, Rabin went to Washington facing 
a real impasse as a result of his policy to defend the illegal 
settlements. These settlements expressed adherence to policies 
of regional expansion and altering the geographic and 
demographic nature of the Israeli-occupied territories. Israel 
wants to impose the illegal presence of these settlements on the 
whole world as an accomplished fact. 
  The Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre has clearly and irrevocably 
revealed the true positions of the Rabin government. It has 
also revealed that this government is just an alleged dove of 
peace, and that it is essentially hostile to peace, just like 
all previous Israeli governments. 
  However, the Rabin government, which deceitfully raised the 
slogan of peace with one hand while committing daily crimes and 
massacres with the other hand, has reaped evil results and 
fallen into the traps it set for the peace process. The 
bargaining chips of peace, which this government has used since 
it assumed power, have lost their value. Hence, Rabin's visit 
to Washington under these circumstances is proof of the deep and 
complicated crisis facing his government. It is also proof of 
the special relationship between the U.S. Administration and 
Israel, and of the extent of this administration's ability to 
convince the Israeli rulers of whatever it wishes. 
  The new political situation -- represented by both the Rabin 
government's state of affairs and the power to convince the 
Israeli rulers that the U.S. Administration enjoys -- makes the 
United States assume an additional great responsibility. This 
is because the United States is the superpower that assumes 
special responsibility toward both global peace and 
international legitimacy, in its capacity as the country that 
unleashed the Middle East peace process. 
  From this premise, the current circumstances seem very 
appropriate for the U.S. Administration to play its role in 
having Rabin comply with the U.S. peace initiative and announce 
his acceptance of the bases of this initiative in order to 
achieve a just and comprehensive peace based on the resolutions 
of international legitimacy in the region. 
  No one can deny that the Arabs, led by Syria, contributed to 
unleashing and preserving this peace opportunity. Without the 
Syrian position in particular, doors would not have been opened 
for the peace process, and the peace talks would not have begun 
in Madrid and resumed in Washington. This is because Israel 
officially rejected the U.S. initiative in writing. Moreover, 
Israel has thus far rejected the bases of the peace process. 
  Syria -- which showed cooperation to render the peace 
process 
a success and which really wants to achieve a just and 
comprehensive peace that will return territories and rights to 
their owners and preserve the dignity of all parties -- does not 
have any problem with the U.S. Administration. Likewise, the 
Arab side, as a whole, does not have any problem with the U.S. 
Administration. Syria and other Arab parties hope the U.S. 
Administration will manage to revive the peace process before 
the latter is finished off by the Israeli Government's policy 
and positions that obstruct this process. 
  The only way to make the U.S. initiative a success and break 
the deadlock in the peace talks is the acceptance by the Israeli 
rulers of the bases of this process, their respect for 
international legitimacy, and their relinquishment of the policy 
of regional expansion, racist fanaticism, war crimes, and 
annihilation. The U.S. Administration is primarily responsible 
for achieving this objective. It is a problem between the U.S. 
Administration and Israel, and not between this administration 
and the Arabs. The key to resolving this problem is in 
Washington's hand.

  [Excerpt] In the first official reaction to statements made 
yesterday by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on the developments of peace in the 
Middle East, Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' said in an 
exclusive statement to the MBC: 
  [Begin al-Shar' recording] The requirements of peace are 
well 
known: Full [Israeli] withdrawal and implementation of Security 
Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. For security and 
stability to be achieved in the region, the peace process must 
be comprehensive. Otherwise, it remains merely talk that will 
not produce concrete results; on the contrary, using hollow 
expressions about peace without real results will lead to 
terrorism and violence, as happened in the massacre at the holy 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque. [end recording] 
  The statement was given during al-Shar's current three-day 
visit to Bonn. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by al-Ustuwani: "Damascus Urges Washington To </F>
Resolve Current Peace Process Impasse"] 
  [Excerpt] Damascus -- Syria yesterday urged the United 
States to act effectively to resolve the current peace process 
impasse. A Syrian official has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that 
Israel caused that impasse and that only international and U.S. 
action can resolve it by putting pressure on Israel to return to 
the basis on which the peace initiative was founded, and by 
doing that on all fronts without putting pressure on the 
Palestinians to implement the Oslo agreement, because that 
agreement has been proven to be a failure and is unacceptable to 
the Palestinian people. 
  The source said that there was no alternative to an Israeli 
declaration of willingness to withdraw completely from all the 
occupied territories in order to ensure the success of the 
negotiations. He added that the settlements issue has become an 
urgent matter which must be discussed to determine the fate of 
the settlers and to work for their evacuation from the occupied 
Arab territories because they have become a daily threat and 
danger to the Palestinian people, as Hebron's al-Ibrahimi mosque 
massacre demonstrated. 
  The official said that the aim of Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin's visit to the United States was to make 
Washington pressure the Palestinians into completing the 
separate peace agreement to enable the occupation authorities to 
impose the settlements for five more years at least, and also to 
paralayze the Security Council and prevent it passing an 
anti-Israel resolution and providing protection for the 
Palestinian people. 
  He said that Syria was still interested in peace and had 
from 
the beginning responded to the prerequisites of the peace 
process, but Israel was placing many obstacles in the way of any 
progress. There will be no progress, he said, as long as Israel 
continues to pursue a policy which does not serve peace in any 
way. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["The Arab League and Jerusalem"--MENA headline] </F>
  [Text] Cairo, 17 Mar (MENA)--The Arab League Secretariat 
today expressed its grave concern over recent media statements 
on Jerusalem. 
  In a statement it issued today, the Arab League Secretariat 
affirmed its stance rejecting these statements because they 
contradict international resolutions, primarily Security Council 
Resolution 252 issued in 1968, which asserts the legal status of 
Jerusalem and stresses that any measures aimed at changing 
Jerusalem's status are void. 
  It pointed out that this resolution calls on Israel to 
immediately stop any acts that lead to changing the status of 
Jerusalem. 
  The Arab League Secretariat statement clarified that the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles stipulated that 
Jerusalem is one of the issues that will be discussed during the 
coming stage of the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations. 
  The statement affirmed the Arab League's concern about the 
peace process and its support for all the international and 
regional efforts aimed at establishing a just and permanent 
peace in the Middle East. 
  The statement noted the U.S. President and Administration's 
concern over the need to make 1994 a year of peace in the Middle 
East. 
  The statement recalled the stances of successive U.S. 
Administrations affirming the special status of Jerusalem by 
considering it occupied territory the fate of which no single 
party has the right to decide unilaterally. They also affirmed 
the need to respect its religious and legal status as the cradle 
of "all divine religions." 
  [Earlier, Cairo MENA in English at 1310 GMT on 17 March 
transmits an unfinished item on the Arab League commenting on 
Jerusalem. Like the above report it is numbered 135 on the MENA 
file, but is entitled "The Arab League and Clinton's Statement." 
It starts out by noting the following: "The Arab League 
Secretariat today expressed its grave concern over statements in 
various media, including Israeli, on remarks by U.S. President 
Bill Clinton and his vice president on Jerusalem. 
  ["The Arab League Secretariat affirmed in a statement it 
issued [item incomplete as received]]

  [Text] Tehran, March 16, IRNA -- The Guardian Council of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran approves the balanced budget plan 
for the new calendar year, 1373 (to start March 21) with a total 
amount of rls. 69,772.75 billion. 
  In view of materialization of the figure envisaged as state 
revenues, the Majles approved the total budget rls 10,000 
billion lower than proposed by the government. The general 
budget of the government for the new year has been predicted at 
rls. 32,303.35 billion. 
  The experience of the past two years over 
non-materialization 
of state revenues as predicted by the budget plan, made the 
parliament adopt a realistic approach towards the figures in 
this year's budget plan and to consider parameters outside the 
country effective in state revenues and to base the revenues and 
state expenditure on realism. 
  Of the total state revenues set at rls. 30,048.9 billion 
from 
public and other resources, rls. 2,254.4 billion will be 
provided by special incomes of ministries and state 
institutions. 
  In view of the sharp fall in oil prices on the world market, 
the Majles decided to limit the income earned through sale of 
oil to dlrs reduced at dlrs. 10.154 billion [as received]. If 
oil revenues go up during the year, the extra amount will be 
spent to repay government commitments in hard cash or to carry 
out some development plans. 
  In the calendar year of 1372 [ending 20 March 1994], the 
total amount of state revenues from oil sales was set at dlrs. 
16.8 billion, of which according to Majles Vice-Speaker Hasan 
Rowhani Iran got dlrs. 4 billion lower than expected from the 
oil sales. 
  He said that in the course of the first development plan, 
Iran lost dlrs., 6.4 billion due to the fall in value of the 
U.S. dollar against other major currencies. Though the revenues 
in hard cash from oil sales are not much, but the Islamic 
Republic of Iran has reached understandings with the two main 
creditor banks of Japan and Germany to reschedule payment of 
dlrs. 4.6 billion, which is owed by Iranian companies to the 
Japanese amd German companies. Iran's schedulled commitments in 
the past year was reduced by 50 percent and it is expected that 
similar understandings would be reached with the creditors and 
the scheduled payments would be met and the growing demands for 
foreign currencies to pay the commitments would fall. 
  According to the new year budget plan, the Majles allowed 
the 
government to repay dlrs. 1,600 billion by the end of the year. 
  The Majles approved that dlrs. 800 million be spent on basic 
commodities including wheat, cooking oil, rice, meat, and sugar. 
The government was allowed to spend dlrs. 400 million to 
produce and import pharmaceuticals and milk powder. 
  The Majles also allocated dlrs. 30 million to be spent on 
higher specialized courses and dlrs. 80 million to provide 
students abroad with hard cash. The total amount of foreign 
currency stood at dlrs. 1,310 million. 
  In order to finance development projects such as dams and 
hydraulic power plants, dlrs 2.3 billion were set aside for the 
Energy Ministry while dlrs. 150 million was earmarked for the 
sugar-cane projects and related industries. The share of the 
fisheries was set at dlrs. 100 million through joint investment 
and buy-back scheme to carry out its development plans. 
  The Majles said that dlrs. 6 billion are to be spent on 
economic development plans of the country. The Majles said the 
Ministry of Energy is to supply 1,080 villages across the 
country with electricity, while the Ministry of Posts, 
Telegraph, and Telephones would set up telecommunications links 
in 500 villages. 
  The Construction Jihad Ministry is expected to supply 1,000 
villages with drinking water, while the Ministry of Transport 
will improve railway services and construct 1,000 kms of new 
rural roads in the new year. Money coming from the sale of the 
shares of factories under the organization of development and 
renovation of national industries of Iran, will be paid to the 
Ministry of Education for spending on its development plans. 
Another rls. 10 billion expected to come from the sale of 
shares of the factories will enable the setting up of 70 
technical and vocational centers. At least rls. 410 billion has 
been earmarked to carry out infrastructural plans in the 
deprived areas of the country. 
  Two-thirds of the income from taxes on imported cigarettes 
and 60 percent of the customs for export of pistachios will be 
channelled towards the Martyr Raja'i relief plan. 
  In order to finance health services, the Ministry of Health 
and Medical Education was given the go ahead to spent money 
earned through issuing of licences for sanitary-ware producing 
units, on modernizing of laboratories and improving the quality 
of pharmaceuticals. 
  Privatization has been envisaged in the new year's budget 
plan to a large extent. A considerable amount of money coming 
from the sale of shares of producing units under the industrial 
ministries will go towards social projects including those of 
the Ministry of Education. In other words, the budget for such 
projects will not be provided if the process of privatization 
does not continue in the course of the new year. 
  An important objective of the budget plan is to allocate 
state revenues in hard cash for basic projects in the oil, 
industry, energy, social welfare, education, health and other 
sectors for developing backward and remote areas of the country.

<F P=106> [Report by Safa Ha'eri: "Tehran: Eleven Dead, 500 Wounded in </F>
Clashes With Police"] 
  [Excerpt] Paris -- Sources in Tehran, quoting a secret 
report they obtained, have said that 11 people were killed and 
over 500 wounded the day before yesterday in large-scale and 
violent clashes between security forces and citizens celebrating 
the traditional "fire day." 
  Ayatollah Khomeyni was the first to oppose this day being 
marked by the Zoroastrian sect, on the grounds that it is part 
of idolatrous rituals that conflict with Islam. Although the 
regime failed to prevent all citizens from marking the occasion 
by igniting fires in public places and the yards of houses, it 
maintained the ban without displaying great enthusiasm for its 
implementation. 
  But this year Ayatollah Khamene'i, spiritual guide of the 
Islamic Republic, issued orders to put security forces on alert 
and deploy them in all major cities, especially Tehran, "to 
eliminate from the streets any signs of the atheists' 
celebrations." 
  According to the report, the clashes between security forces 
and demonstrators, the majority of whom were young men, began 
after midday the day before yesterday and continued until late 
at night. Eleven people, among them one policeman, were killed 
and 530 wounded, among them 180 security men. And 2,598 were 
arrested, many of whom were released after interrogation. 
  Religious authorities imposed a media blackout on the 
clashes, but sources close to security forces and the 
Information Ministry described the clashes as "unprecedented and 
organized." 
  Opposition sources in Iran have confirmed the occurrence of 
the clashes. A report released by the Iranian National Party, 
one of the oldest secular political organizations in the 
country, said that "street battles broke out between citizens 
and security forces in Tehran and the neighborhoods of Akbatan, 
Ghisha, Aryashahr, and Shahrak Gharb..., and security forces 
opened fire and used tear gas." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Nairobi, March 17 (AFP) -- Sudan's Islamic 
fundamentalist government and mainly Christian and black 
southern rebels agreed Thursday [17 March] to launch peace talks 
aimed at ending a decades-old civil war. 
  The agreement came after hours of closed-door talks here 
between Sudanese President 'Umar al-Bashir and the presidents of 
Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda, who also met leaders of two rival 
factions of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). 
  "The government of Sudan and the SPLA factions have stated 
their readiness to immediately embark on peace negotiations," 
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said. 
  The six-nation regional organisation, the Intergovernmental 
Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD), has named Kenya, 
Ethiopia, Uganda and Eritrea to spearhead a new initiative to 
bring peace to famine-hit Sudan. 
  The agreement stopped short of declaring a ceasefire in 
southern Sudan, where the government has taken advantage of 
tribal divisions in the SPLA to launch a new offensive aimed at 
crushing the southern rebellion. 
  But the IGADD presidents said in a press statement that the 
warring parties had agreed to "desist from esclating hostilities 
... in order to create a conducive atmosphere for the 
negotiations." 
  "The root causes of the conflict are so complex that 
previous 
peace conference have failed to arrive at a peaceful solution," 
Moi told his fellow heads of state and rebel leaders in a brief 
open session after the meetings. 
  "We must be prepared to give peace a chance," Moi said, 
stressing that Africans had to play a more active role in 
solving their problems instead of waiting for outside 
initiatives. 
  He said the forthcoming negotiations would try to reach "a 
comprehensive negotiated settlement and urged all sides to allow 
relief supplies into southern Sudan, where millions depend on 
food aid.

  [Text] The third meeting of the IGADD [Inter-Governmental 
Authority on Drought and Development] committee was held today 
at State House Nairobi under the chairmanship of His Excellency 
President Daniel arap Moi: 
  [Moi] "Dear brothers, leaders of the two SPLM/SPLA movement, 
ladies and gentlemen: Your presence in Nairobi for this crucial 
meeting of the IGADD committee on the conflict in the Sudan to 
launch the Sudan peace talks is a clear demonstration of the 
importance you all attach to the success of the IGADD 
initiatives. The root causes of this conflict are so complex 
that numerous previous initiatives have failed to arrive at a 
peaceful settlement. We must not allow that to happen again, but 
let us all give peace a chance. 
  Meanwhile, the long drawn out conflict has cost thousands of 
lives and led to immeasurable suffering for many more. I have 
always held the view that we in Africa must not remain passive 
and wait for outsiders to seek solutions for problems within our 
continent. Brothers: We ourselves should take an active role 
in finding solutions to problems in our continent whether they 
are political, military, economic or social. [Word indistinct] 
(?let) all of us assembled here today reiterate our commitment 
to the noble but difficult task of searching for a peaceful 
resolution to the conflict. Finally and out of this initiative 
let peace come to the Sudan." 
  At the end the meeting, a statement was released and read by 
Kenya's minister for foreign affairs and international 
cooperation, Mr. Kalonzo Musyoka: 
  [Musyoka] "The IGADD committee met with His Excellency 
General 'Umar Hasan al-Bashir, president of the republic of the 
Sudan, and subsequently met the leaders of the two SPLM/SPLA 
factions, Dr. John Garang and Dr. Riak Machar, and conducted 
intensive consultations within itself and the parties concerned 
and agreed to launch the IGADD peace talks on the Sudan. The 
committee and the parties to the conflict agreed that pursuant 
to the mandate given by the meeting of the IGADD summit held in 
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on 6th and 7th September 1993, the 
negotiations shall take into consideration the previous efforts 
in search of a solution to the conflict, namely talks held in 
August 1989 in Addis Ababa, December 1989 in Nairobi, May-June 
1992 and April-May 1993 in Abuja and May 1993 in Nairobi. 
  The committee expressed serious concern at the continued 
human suffering, misery, famine and disease in the war-affected 
areas. It was agreed that the parties to the conflict shall 
allow access to relief agencies to ensure that relief assistance 
is delivered to suffering people in those areas. The committee 
also expressed deep concern that the long-drawn [out] conflict 
was a threat to peace and security in the sub-region. 
  In reference to the stated commitment to the IGADD peace 
initiative, including their readiness to immediately embark on 
negotiations, the parties to the conflict agreed to send to the 
peace talks high-level delegations with full mandates to 
negotiate. 
  The committee called upon the parties concerned to the 
conflict to exercise restraint and desist from escalating 
hostilities, including actions that might jeopardize the IGADD 
initiative, in order to create a conducive atmosphere for 
conduct of negotiations. 
  The IGADD committee decided the standing committee of 
ministers of foreign affairs shall conduct the peace 
negotiations under the supervision of the chairman of the IGADD 
committee and directed the standing committee to start the 
negotiating process immediately. The IGADD committee further 
appealed to the international community to continue supporting 
the initiative. I thank you Your Excellencies."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A New Balfour Declaration, The American Way!"] </F>
  [Text] Since the start of the Arab-Israeli conflict, not a 
single U.S. administration has dared to publicly recognize 
Jerusalem as Israel's unified and eternal capital. The official 
position of all the U.S. administrations in all written 
documents has left the future of Jerusalem up to all parties to 
decide as part of a just and comprehensive settlement in the 
Middle East. 
  But unfortunately, it seems that U.S. President Bill Clinton 
has a different view that conflicts with the firm position of 
all the past U.S. administrations. The U.S. President has 
surprised us by making this serious shift in position in remarks 
that were carried by Israeli radio. He made the remarks during 
a meeting with leaders of the Zionist-U.S. lobby at the White 
House on the eve of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's visit 
to Washington. Clinton has found in himself the courage to 
explicitly say that he considers Jerusalem to be Israel's 
eternal and unified capital of Israel and to pledge to obstruct 
the issuance of a Security Council resolution condemning the 
massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque if it referred, even 
indirectly, to Jerusalem as part of the occupied Arab 
territories. 
  It is Clinton's right to appease the Jews and to give them 
any U.S. concessions that he wants in terms of weapons or money, 
but he has no right, under any circumstances or with any 
justification, to pay for these concessions out of the Arabs' 
pockets and at the expense of their sacred sites and their 
inalienable historical rights in Jerusalem. Clinton has picked 
the worst time ever to go public with his real position, because 
it looks like a reward to Israel for committing the massacre at 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  We have a right to question the credibility and the 
seriousness of the U.S. efforts to promote peace. So far, these 
efforts have resulted in nothing but a series of concessions 
that the United States makes to Israel at the expense of the 
Arabs, whether they like it or not.

  [Text] Cairo, 17 Mar (MENA)--The National Progressive 
Unionist Grouping [NPUG] party has denounced the statement 
attributed to U.S. President Bill Clinton that his country 
considers unified Jerusalem with its Eastern and Western sectors 
the capital of Israel. 
  In a statement it issued today, the NPUG notes with deepest 
feelings of resentment that this U.S. statement in support of 
the policy of aggression and the annexation of the occupied 
territories comes at a time when world public opinion is 
unanimously condemning the criminal massacre that Israel 
committed at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  The NPUG called on the Arab League and the Islamic 
Conference 
Organization to adopt a firm stand on this new escalation of the 
attacks on the rights and dignities of the Arabs and Muslims.

<F P=106> [Report from Muhammad Sadiq in Washington and unattributed </F>
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT report from Cairo: "Washington: Israel 
Fabricated Clinton's Statement on Jerusalem"] 
  [Text] The U.S. Administration yesterday denied the 
statement attributed to President Bill Clinton that he 
considered Jerusalem to be the unified capital of Israel. A 
U.S. State Department official has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that 
"President Clinton's position on the issue of Jerusalem is the 
same as that of former presidents, and it is firm and has not 
changed." 
  He pointed out that the allegations made in this connection 
were "wrong, fabricated, and inaccurate." He emphatically drew 
attention to what President Clinton said at his press conference 
the day before yesterday that "the question of Jerusalem is up 
to the parties to decide, and the Declaration of Principles says 
that a decision on that will be made in the final stage, and 
that is what we think should be done." 
  The official said that "the report was a fabrication by the 
Israeli media." He said he hoped that "the media would be 
accurate and truthful in their reporting." 
  The U.S. official also denied similar statements attributed 
to Vice President Albert Gore. 
  The issue was raised after President Clinton's meeting last 
week with Steven Crossman, chairman of the American-Israeli 
Political Action Committee [AIPAC], the most influential Jewish 
organization in the United States, but U.S. official sources 
have stated that the issue of Jerusalem is not a matter for 
speculation and that the position on it is clear and has already 
been stated. 
  Timothy Wirth, U.S. State Department adviser on population, 
environment, and terrorism, stressed yesterday that the U.S. 
position on Jerusalem is firm and that the U.S. Embassy cannot 
be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem because the question of the 
capital is one of the issues to be resolved in the 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. He referrred to President 
Clinton's statement at his joint press conference with Rabin on 
the U.S. firm position on Jerusalem. He stressed that the CNN 
report claiming Clinton stated that Jerusalem was Israel's 
capital was untrue. 
  Egyptian President Husni Mubarak yesterday received the U.S. 
State Department's adviser on population, environment, and 
terrorism in the president's office at Heliopolis. 
  In the first Egyptian reaction, Egyptian Foreign Minister 
'Amr Musa said that he saw Clinton's statement as a political 
and tactical one. He added that if the statement meant a new 
U.S. policy on Jerusalem, then Egypt would be in total 
disagreement with that policy. He said that the U.S. Embassy in 
Israel is still in Tel Aviv and has not been moved to Jerusalem 
yet. 
  Musa added: Jerusalem is a part of the occupied Arab 
territory and we reject any Israeli measures Judaizing it or 
making it Israel's eternal capital.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Muhammad Sifr 'Id: "America on Trial"] </F>
  [Text] In accordance with U.S. law, the U.S. Government 
gives itself the right to pursue those it sees as terrorists, 
detain them at any location, and transport them to the United 
States to face trial in a U.S. court of justice. Such a 
procedure is applicable to individuals who attack U.S. citizens 
or property in any part of the world. Disparities between U.S. 
and international law in this regard are not seen as 
representing an obstacle to this effort. 
  The Government of the United States branded as terrorism the 
Palestinian acts of resistance against occupation. The United 
States labeled the PLO "a terrorist organization," a view that 
was in keeping with the one held by Israel until the PLO signed 
the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. Washington 
also prepared a list of "countries sponsoring terror," rattling 
it like a sword in the face of countries with whose policies it 
disagrees. 
  The massacre in al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron is a classic 
example of a terrorist operation. This is true by the standards 
of common sense as well as U.S. and international law. The 
massacre was perpetrated by Barukh Goldstein, who remained a 
U.S. citizen even after obtaining Israeli nationality, a 
practice common among Jewish Americans immigrating to Israel. 
This gives us the right to ask for the United States to be 
included on the list of "countries sponsoring terror." 
  Other reasons reinforce this claim. Goldstein hails from 
Brooklyn, a hotbed of Jewish fanaticism. Brooklyn is U.S. 
territory, as you may know, and Goldstein is not the first 
Jewish terrorist that Brooklyn fired like a gun in the face of 
the Palestinians in particular and Arab Americans in general. 
  The U.S. Government allows and even encourages Jewish 
Americans to collect financial and material donations and send 
them to Israel. Donations collected in the United States go 
directly to settlers in the occupied territories, despite a U.S. 
policy considering the settlements illegal. 
  The United States can, therefore, be seen as a state that 
sponsors terror. Although indirectly, the United States 
encourages Israeli settlers to commit crimes similar to the 
Hebron massacre.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, March 18 (AFP)--Egypt's two main armed 
Islamic groups vowed Friday to avenge the execution of two 
fundamentalist soldiers and death sentences passed on nine other 
militants. 
  In statements issued here, the al-Jihad (holy war) group 
said 
it would exact revenge for the death sentences passed on nine 
members of its military wing Tala'i' al-Fath [Vanguards of 
Conquest] Thursday by a military court in Cairo for a failed 
assassination bid on Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi last November in 
which a schoolgirl died. 
  The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) vowed to 
overthrow the government of President Husni Mubarak following 
the execution of two fundamentalist soldiers in Alexandria 
Thursday for plotting to kill the Egyptian leader. 
  Second lieutenant in the reserves Midhat al-Tahawi and 
conscript Muhammad Ahmad Sa'id Salih, both members of the 
al-Jama'ah, were sentenced to death by the Sidi Barrani military 
court on February 16. 
  They were accused of having planned an assassination attempt 
against Mubarak, who was due to visit the Sidi Barrani military 
base near the Libyan border. 
  A third soldier condemned to death, Hamadah Muhammad Lutfi, 
was still on the run. He was also a member of the al-Jama'ah. 
  The group's statement said Mubarak's murder was "a duty laid 
down by Shariah (Islamic law)." 
  It quoted al-Tahawi's "last wish," for Egyptians to become 
holy warriors and set up an Islamic state. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Text" of letter by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz to </F>
Jean-Bernard Merimee, French permanent representative to United 
Nations and current president of the UN Security Council, UNSC; 
on 16 March] 
  [Text] Your excellency Jean-Bernard Merimee, president of 
the UN Security Council [UNSC], New York; 
  Sir; 
  On the occasion of my visit to New York as head of the Iraqi 
political and technical delegation, on the occasion of my talks 
with you and with members of the UNSC, in view of the fact that 
the date set for the periodic review of the unfair embargo 
clamped on the Iraqi people since August 1990 is approaching, 
and having analyzed the situation since Iraq delivered the 
official letter containing an acceptance of its commitments as 
enshrined in Resolution 715 on 26 November 1993, I would like to 
explain the following points: 
  First, Iraq has honored all its commitments as enshrined in 
Section C of Resolution 687, namely, Paragraphs 8,9,10,11,12, 
and 13. It also officially accepted Resolution 715 on 26 
November 1993. Likewise, it has demonstrated its willingness to 
cooperate with the Special Commission and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency to enforce the monitoring mechanism and 
achieve the objectives set forth in Resolution 687 in this 
regard. It has extended all necessary facilities in this 
regard. Of particular importance in this regard is the fact 
that Iraq pledged in October 1993 that the Special Commission 
and the IAEA would be able to conduct the required inspections, 
even after Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 is implemented per 
Document No. S/26,571, Paragraph 13. 
  The very text of Resolution 687 provides that the UNSC shall 
fully implement Paragraph 22 of the said resolution immediately 
after Iraq officially accepted Resolution 715, something which 
has failed to materialize. 
  In accordance with the promises made by Ambassador Rolf 
Ekeus, chairman of the Special Commission, contained in Annex 3 
of the joint report submitted to the UNSC in the aftermath of 
high-level technical talks held in New York in September 1993, 
per Document No. S/26,451, Paragraph 14 of Annex 2, and 
Paragraph 7 of the report, the Special Commission was supposed 
to have quickly embarked on the official implementation of the 
monitoring measures enshrined in Resolution 715 as of 1 December 
1993, particularly since Iraq officially accepted the said 
resolution on 26 November 1993. Similarly, the chairman of the 
Special Commission should have submitted his report to the UNSC 
on Iraq's compliance within a period not exceeding six months 
from the aforementioned date so that Paragraph 22 may be 
implemented. 
  Also worth mentioning in this regard is the fact that the 
six-month period Ambassador Ekeus spoke about last fall was not 
originally mentioned in the text of Resolutions 687 and 715. 
The chairman of the Special Commission imposed it by himself or 
upon the request of certain states. However, what happened is 
that after about four months after Iraq's official approval of 
Resolution 715 on 26 November 1993, the chairman of the Special 
Commission still did not announce the date of the official start 
of the implementation of the monitoring system although 
monitoring procedures actually began before Iraq's official 
approval of Resolution 715. This is proven by the installation 
and operation of cameras in October 1993 in the al-Rafah and 
al-Yawm al-'Azim locations to monitor missile testing. 
Moreover, three inspection teams observed temporary monitoring 
measures for three months starting from the beginning of 1993 at 
the Ibn-al-Haytham Center for Missile Research and some other 
important installations. This is in addition to the continuous 
presence of UN teams for over one and a half years in the 
al-Muthanna establishment in connection with chemical weapons. 
Helicopters have been continuously and intensively conducting 
sorties for surveillance purposes since 1991. 
  It is also worth mentioning that the IAEA emphasized in 
October 1993 that it started monitoring procedures 15 months 
earlier and that it was convinced that the surveillance plan was 
being implemented satisfactorily and that all the IAEA needed to 
inform the Security Council of Iraq's compliance with its 
commitments in accordance with Paragraph 22 was Iraq's official 
acceptance of Resolution 715, Document F-26571, Paragraphs 16 
and 19. 
  This position by the Special Commission means the Commission 
will be late in presenting its report on Iraq's compliance with 
Section C of Resolution 687 to the Security Council so that the 
latter will consider the implementation of Paragraph 22. This 
means the postponement of the implementation of Paragraph 22 to 
an unspecified date. The technical pretexts and excuses being 
used to justify this behavior are baseless because there is no 
technical reason whatsoever to make the Special Commission 
abstain from officially declaring the start of the monitoring 
plan. 
  It has become clear to us that the Special Commission's 
stand is a premeditated political stand instigated by specific 
parties in the Council, which do not wish to lift the unjust 
embargo on Iraq and want to impose on Iraq conditions that have 
nothing to do with the Council's resolutions. They announce 
policies that are not related to the Council's resolutions, as 
contained in the article "Confronting the Renegade Countries" 
published by Anthony Lake, the U.S. President's adviser for 
national security affairs, in the March 1994 issue of FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS magazine and the other statements along the same line by 
U.S. officials. 
  These quarters exploit their influence in the Council and in 
the Special Commission to impose the continuation of the embargo 
on Iraq. 
  Second: It is impermissible to make the question of 
maintaining the embargo on Iraq a diplomatic or political game. 
The embargo has led to the death of Iraqi citizens and to 
depriving an entire people of normal living conditions. The 
reports by the UN agencies confirm the tragic results of this 
unjust embargo, which has been imposed for four years. Warning 
237 issued in July 1993 by the joint mission of the Food and 
Agriculture Organization [FAO] and the World Food Program and 
the report by the FAO mission issued in November 1993 evaluating 
the food situation in Iraq clearly describes this situation. 
Statistics also show that the mortality rate among children 
below five years of age has risen sevenfold from 1989 to 1993, 
and fourfold for those above this age. The comprehensive 
embargo that has been going on for four years has greatly 
damaged the level of public services, education, health, 
transportation, agriculture, civilian industries, environment 
and all other fields. 
  From this premise, the approach the Iraqi people and their 
leadership have toward the embargo issue cannot be one of 
indulgence toward the timetable certain members or countries 
view as a political game. For Iraq, this is a question of life 
and death. 
  Third, following these experiences, Iraq is not reassured 
that the Council, in view of the pressure by specific countries, 
will ever fulfill its obligations since Iraq has already 
fulfilled its obligations under Section C of Resolution 687. 
This lack of reassurance reflects itself on Iraq's assessment 
of the Council's stand on this issue and the other topics 
mentioned in the other pertinent Council resolutions. 
  Iraq demands that the Council apply Paragraph 22 of 
Resolution 687 immediately and without any additional 
restrictions or conditions, that it respect the provisions of 
its resolutions, that it interpret them in a sound legal manner, 
and that it reject the tendentious political interpretations of 
its resolutions that some states are seeking to impose on the 
Council. Allowing for such political interpretations of 
resolutions as noted in some parties' statements not only 
clashes with the provisions of the resolutions themselves, but 
actually means that every party inside and outside the Council 
can have its own interpretation. This means that the Council 
resolutions will have no specific meaning or target. 
  Fourth, regarding the other topics mentioned in the relevant 
Security Council resolutions, including the issue of Kuwait, 
which was raised by some member states in their contacts with 
the Iraqi side, we would like to point out the following: 
  A. This issue is absolutely unconnected with the issue of 
applying Paragraph 22, in accordance with the provisions of 
Resolution 687. 
  B. Iraq has taken measures regarding this issue in 
accordance with Paragraph 2A of Resolution 686 of 1991 and 
informed the Council of this. Iraq has also accepted Resolution 
687, which dealt with the subject. 
  C. It is obvious that when the Council fulfills its 
commitments toward Iraq as cited in Paragraph 22 and proves its 
credibility and good intentions toward a UN member state that 
contributed to the founding of the International organization, 
and when Iraq feels that its rights and legitimate interests 
have been respected by the Council and that its sovereignty has 
been respected by the Council member states, which are violating 
its sovereignty through the imposition of a ban on military and 
civilian flights in the north and south and interference in its 
domestic affairs in all possible means, a new atmosphere will 
certainly emerge and the issue can then be discussed in 
accordance with the rules regulating relations among states as 
cited in the UN Charter and the Arab League Charter, which Iraq 
has always respected. This atmosphere will also help the Arab 
states in the region to solve their problems in a peaceful 
manner on the basis of mutual respect for rights and interests 
and in accordance with the rules of the Arab League Charter, 
which regulates relations among the Arab states. 
  The Security Council can, in such a climate, also contribute 
to encouraging the Arab states to achieve this objective and in 
a manner that guarantees the peace and security and rights of 
states in a fair manner. 
  Fifth, Iraq hopes these points will be studied very 
carefully 
by the Council. When the Security Council asks a certain state 
to abide by a resolution, the resolution must also be binding on 
the Council and the Council must apply the commitments 
stipulated by the Charter or by the resolution itself toward 
that state. Regarding the resolutions passed on Iraq, their 
provisions are clear. There are commitments and steps that Iraq 
is required to implement and Iraq has implemented the 
substantial parts of them, including all those pertaining to the 
implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687. Therefore, 
the Council is requested to respect and implement Iraq's rights 
as stipulated by the Council resolutions. The issue cannot be 
dealt with by asking one party to honor its commitments without 
the other party's implementation of its commitments. The 
continuation of this state, from which the Iraqi people are 
bitterly and harshly suffering, places the people and leadership 
of Iraq in a position that will certainly lead to a reassessment 
of the situation and to an action [tasarruf] that will protect 
the Iraqi people from the harm to which they are being exposed. 
We are awaiting tangible steps that we hope will emerge in the 
near future, foremost of which is the implementation of 
Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 without additional restrictions 
or conditions. 
  Please accept our great respect and appreciation. 
  [Signed] Tariq 'Aziz, deputy prime minister, New York, 16 
March 1994

  [Text] New York/United Nations, 17 Mar (INA)--Jean-Bernard 
Merimee, French permanent representative to the United Nations 
and current president of the UN Security Council [UNSC], has 
said that his country noticed that Iraq did not contradict the 
statements which showed that it intends to respect the 
provisions of Resolution 715. 
  In a speech during the UNSC's review of the sanctions 
imposed 
on Iraq last night, he expressed the hope that the Special 
Commission will be able to put in force the mechanisms to 
monitor the Iraqi weapons industry. 
  Merimee added that the effective participation of French 
experts in the Special Commission's activities proves France's 
commitment to the implementation of long-term monitoring plans. 
  The French envoy said his country believes it is very useful 
that the Special Commission chairman faces the UNSC in order to 
accurately explain preparations concerning the implementation of 
Resolution 715, and to establish a timetable defining the 
beginning of the probation period. He said that four months 
after Iraq recognized its obligations under Resolution 715, his 
country believes that the Special Commission should know when it 
will be prepared to begin long-term verification if Iraq 
continues its cooperation satisfactorily. 
  The UNSC president pointed out that after the termination of 
the six-month probation period, his country will then believe 
that the time will be appropriate for the UNSC to announce its 
position toward the implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 
687. 
  In his speech, Merimee said that France emphasizes two 
points. The first is that the progress that has taken place 
leads France to the conviction that the UNSC cannot continue the 
same course. He indicated that his country is of the view that 
it is appropriate for the UNSC to change the routine formula in 
accordance with which it ends its review of the sanctions. He 
said that such a change would be through an explicit UNSC 
indication that progress has actually taken place. 
  Regarding the second point, the French ambassador to the 
United Nations said: We now hope we will have a clear idea 
about the timetable in accordance with which the probation 
period will commence. 
  He added: As soon as Iraq officially accepts its commitments 
in accordance with Resolution 715--and this is what has happened 
since 26 November 1993--we hope we will obtain clarifications 
from the Special Commission on its intentions regarding the 
timetable. 
  Reports coming from New York indicate that the dispute among 
the UN Security Council members on the language of the 
traditional statement issued by the council every two months is 
still intense. Some UNSC members are demanding that the 
statement refer to the progress that has been achieved with 
regard to the implementation of the provisions of Resolution 687 
and Iraq's approval of Resolution 715 concerning future 
monitoring. 
  This statement is expected to be issued tomorrow, Friday.

al-Rasafah, Baghdad, today, through which the masses expressed 
their full support for the triumphant leader, President Saddam 
Husayn, until final victory is achieved and the unjust blockade 
is lifted. 
  The demonstrators were received by Comrade 'Abd-al-Ghani 
'Abd-al- Ghafur, member of the Iraq Command of the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party and official in charge of the Ba'th 
party's organizations in al- Rasafah. 
  During the mammoth demonstrations the slogan of "The people 
are with the leader to seize our rights to lift the unjust 
blockade" was raised. The masses of Saddam city renewed full 
allegiance to the builder of Iraq's great glory and the leader 
of the march of righteous victory, leader President Saddam 
Husayn. They stressed that they will continue to be loyal 
soldiers under the Allahu Akbar [God is great] banner raised by 
his excellency, and expressed their readiness to do their utmost 
to break the unjust blockade in defense of great Iraq, its 
sovereignty, and dignity. 
  Comrade 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur, member of the Iraq 
Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party and official in charge 
of the Ba'th party's organizations in al-Rasafah, stressed that 
leader President Saddam Husayn's address to the prime minister 
and ministers was an expression of the conscience of the patient 
and faithful people who are facing the conspiracy of the unjust 
blockade with strong faith and consciences. 
  In a statement to INA, he said: Iraq's masses and party, 
popular, and trade unionist organizations express their full 
support for what was included in struggler President Saddam 
Husayn's address in order to sieze our mujahid people's rights 
and make the UN Security Council lift the unjust blockade after 
Iraq has fulfilled its obligations toward the UN Security 
Council resolutions, despite the fact that they are unjust and 
unfair resolutions. 
  Comrade 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur noted that the 
continuation of the unjust blockade under pressure from the 
United States and Zionism means the continuation of plotting 
against our Iraq, its present, and the future of its 
generations. He stressed that the Iraqi people, under the 
leadership of President Saddam Husayn, will continue to set an 
example for Arab and world masses in their confrontation of 
current injustice and tyranny in the world in light of the 
so-called new world order, proceeding from the historical fact 
that the Mother of battles was a nationalist, pan-Arab, and 
humanitarian battle.

  [Text] Baghdad, 17 Mar (INA) -- Two Iraqi newspapers have 
denounced the UN Security Council's unjust and arbitrary stand 
toward Iraq, particularly the unjust resolutions it has issued 
under pressure by the United States and other parties. 
  In their editorials today, the newspapers AL-'IRAQ and BABIL 
noted that the Iraqi side has been very patient, wise, and 
responsible in order to remove the covers intended to be the 
cornerstone of the blockade conspiracy. They stressed that the 
United States, through the UN Special Commission, deliberately 
pushed escalation and maneuvering, refusing to admit that Iraq 
has shown every form of cooperation, and that the unjust 
blockade imposed on it is no longer justified. 
  AL-'IRAQ says: The Special Commission, which is fully aware 
of Iraq's implementation of the clauses of Section C, has, many 
times, used double standards that raised doubts and suspicions. 
This was revealed by the foreign minister in his television 
interview the day before yesterday, in which he said that the 
Special Commission's chairman had signed official and documented 
minutes of meetings in Baghdad that prove Iraq's commitment, 
and, at the same time, made statements outside Iraq that 
conflict with these minutes. He stressed that all this took 
place in accordance with U.S. inspirations, whose motives and 
objectives have been exposed. 
  The paper adds: Even stranger is that the UN Security 
Council and the Special Commission premeditatedly imposed a news 
blackout on Iraq's sincere stands and cooperation, and 
misinterpret the paragraphs and statements that prove this. 
  The paper notes that the current approaches at the UN 
Security Council prove the isolation of the United States and 
its wicked efforts to maintain the blockade and to evade its 
legal, moral, and political responsibilities toward Iraq. 
  The paper calls on the UN Security Council to behave in 
accordance with its true task, namely, to maintain peace, to 
remove injustice which is the result of the unfair and 
irresponsible U.S. stands, and to take the only action that will 
prove it is up to the responsibilities entrusted to it by the 
international community, namely, to lift the blockade imposed on 
the Iraqi people. 
  The newspaper BABIL says: During his meeting with the prime 
minister and the ministers four days ago, President Saddam 
Husayn defined the contents of the decisive Iraqi confrontation 
with the enemies. He has also frankly explained the 
premeditated objectives of America and those who revolve in its 
orbit of maintaining the unjust blockade against Iraq, despite 
the fact that it has fulfilled its obligations in accordance 
with the unfair UN Security Council resolutions. 
  The paper touches on the role of the Iraqi will in achieving 
victory over our enemies in our decisive battle, the battle of 
lifting the blockade. It stresses that it is a comprehensive 
economic, political, social, cultural, and moral battle in which 
the efforts of good Iraqis must be pooled in all walks of life 
and at all production sites. 
  The paper explains that Iraq's decisive determination to 
lift 
the comprehensive blockade will lead to the adoption of another 
path that will open the doors of hope for our people and enable 
them to embark on mighty revolutionary action, in light of the 
international changes in favor of our just stand made possible 
by our steadfastness and patience.

  [Text] Baghdad, 18 Mar (INA)--Two Iraqi papers have 
denounced the U.S. Administration's attitude concerning the 
lifting of the blockade that is still imposed on the Iraqi 
people even after Iraq has fully complied with all UN 
resolutions. 
  In their analyses today, AL-'IRAQ and AL-THAWRAH say that 
Washington is working on employing the economic embargo as a 
political framework to serve its imperialist goals in the region. 
  AL-'IRAQ draws the world's attention to the dangers of the 
U.S. exploitation of world organizations. It says: The 
Security Council's failure to assert its independence and its 
submission to the desires of a policy that is unrelated to the 
international legitimacy or the UN Security Council's 
resolutions will turn the Council into a tool for mass murder 
against the Iraqi people. 
  AL-IRAQ questions the usefulness of the Iraqi people's and 
leadership's continued adherence to and compliance with the 
resolutions of the Security Council, which does not respect its 
own obligations and resolutions. It urges the peace and freedom 
loving nations to stress the independence of their positions and 
adopt positive steps that would end the U.S. hegemony over the 
UN resolutions and the power to issue UN resolutions. 
  AL-THAWRAH says fairness must dominate relations between 
Iraq 
and world organizations after the exacerbation of the state of 
injustice and unfairness that has afflicted Iraq as a result of 
the economic embargo imposed against it. 
  The paper, mouthpiece of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, 
says: It has become clear that those who oppose the lifting of 
the embargo now have nothing to justify their opposition. If 
the logic of brute force, deception, and extortion is all they 
have to rely on, their position is now more exposed than ever 
before. 
  The paper stresses that the U.S. Administration is losing 
much of its power and influence in the world by insisting on 
entrenching this despicable, hostile action, represented by the 
blockade. The paper urges the U.S. Administration to benefit 
from the lessons of the past three years with their major 
events. It stresses that these events have not been able to 
harm the substance of the Iraqi steadfastness despite the 
significant size of the scheme and despite what was offered by 
the agents and the regional traitors and mercenaries.

<F P=106> [Address by Yasir 'Arafat, chairman of the PLO Executive </F>
Committee, to the Palestinian people; place and date not given 
-- read by announcer] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. [passage omitted]. O brothers, O my kinfolk, O 
masses of our struggling people, O revolutionaries, strugglers, 
and mujahidin of our struggling people. I am addressing you to 
express my pride, and that of your brothers in the Palestinian 
leadership, at this splendid steadfastness and this courageous 
attitude that shows the great nature of our people, especially 
at times of trial and difficulties. After the hideous slaughter 
perpetrated by the killer settlers and the occupying army, our 
entire people rose to defend its existence, sanctities, dignity, 
and its hope while waiting for the moment to end the hateful 
Israeli occupation, the imposing of the national authority 
stage, and then the forming of an independent Palestinian state 
with Jerusalem as its capital. 
  I am addressing you in the sincere and clear words of those 
who have borne the trust and, at the same, have stood ready to 
sacrifice their lives for our people to secure its future, 
dignity, freedom, and independence. I tell you with all 
brotherhood and frankness -- given the importance of persistence 
and steadfastness in these difficult days in which we must 
always ignore the attempts by some to spread programmed rumors 
and a climate of frustration and despair -- I tell you with all 
frankness that we are facing one of the fiercest battles at a 
time when our people, under the PLO leadership, is forcefully 
knocking at the doors of independence and freedom, and at a time 
when the international community is looking forward to seeing 
the Palestinian rights realized with the rhythm of successive 
events. This is one of a series of our battles that we have 
been continuously fighting since the first bullet was fired on 1 
January 1965, a fact that was crowned with the outbreak of the 
great national Intifadah that is continuing and escalating, and 
which will continue and will further escalate until the 
objectives of our people are realized, i.e. to end the 
occupation and realize the independence and freedom for our 
people, land, and sanctities. 
  The settlements were, and still are, one of the obstacles 
that faced us and still faces us in our talks with the Israelis. 
  The international community and decisions stand beside us in 
connection with these settlements that are an obstacle on the 
road to peace, therefore, our faith was never shaken for a 
moment that it would be the fate of these settlement to 
disappear, and the fate of the settlers would be to depart from 
our land because what was based on a myth was void in origin. 
  Events have proven the truth of our stance and international 
public opinion realized the enormity of this matter, and the 
issue of disarming the settlers became the prelude for the 
dismantlement of the settlement and its removal from our land. 
  This cooperation between units from the Israeli Army and 
armed settlers that we are now facing is the same as the one 
that our Algerian brothers faced during the first and second 
Evian talks. 
  We confronted this ordeal in the same way as we have 
previously faced numerous ordeals. It had only strengthened our 
faith and belief in the strength of our right and the justice of 
our aims. 
  In the past, we have suffered a great deal. This suffering 
consolidated our belief and conviction in the strength of our 
right and the legitimacy of our goals. Consequently, we 
stressed this stance, as dictated by national responsibility, 
regarding the need to provide international protection for our 
people; and to bring the international community face to face 
with its responsibilities and confront this terrible plan. 
  While we were engaged in a diplomatic battle inside the UNSC 
[UN Security Council] to arm ourselves with an international 
resolution; and while we were discussing it within the 
Palestinian leadership, and debating the ways to deal with this 
battle; some people, who are professional in sowing chaos, were 
pronouncing unjust verdicts and writing false statements. We 
did not pay attention to their fabricated lies because we have 
been, and still are, refusing to be dragged into marginal 
battles. We have, and still consider that the battle against 
the occupying enemy forms the basis for the confrontation 
against the occupiers; rather than the deliberate sowing of 
confusion by all the enemies of the Palestinian dream, the 
Palestinian homeland, and the Palestinian existence [Koranic 
verse]. 
  Brothers, I would like to say that we have remained loyal to 
the trust, promise and pledge; the pledge and promise of the 
pure innocent martyrs. The honor of responsibility warrants us 
to stand steadfast against all trials and incidents whose 
impacts can only strengthen our faith, might, and resolve. At 
times of suffering and challenges, we should all stand united, 
with a united heart, we should think in a responsible way and 
search for all methods of confrontation, including resorting to 
help from international public opinion and the international 
legitimate institutions, foremost of which is the United 
Nations, international and Arab institutions such as the Arab 
League, the Nonaligned Movement, the ICO [Islamic Conference 
Organization], the OAU [Organization of African Unity], and all 
our friends around the world. 
  This is a savage battle brought about by the Hebron 
massacre, 
the Jerusalem massacre, the 'Ayn Garah massacre, the massacre of 
Sabra and Shatila, Dir Yasin, and also the difficult 
confrontations in Jinin Rafah, the Triangle [as heard], 
al-Nasiraha, and al-Naqab. 
  We have suspended negotiations with the Israelis, and we 
have 
clearly stated that these negotiations will not resume until our 
people receive all guarantees for international protection, the 
dismantling of settlements that threaten to sabotage the peace 
negotiations, and to punish the perpetrators of the crime. 
  The battle will not stop at that level because we have a 
lot of details that lie ahead of us, and on our agenda are 
fateful issues that require fair solutions in order to 
consolidate the just peace. At the fore of these issues is the 
issue of Jerusalem that America refuses to mention in the 
Security Council's resolution, the issue of the refugees, the 
dismantling of the settlements, the borders, the gaining of 
total national independence, and the creation of our independent 
state with holy Jerusalem as its capital. [passage omitted] 
  Among the urgent issues is the issue of our brothers who are 
detained in the occupation prisons. We will not rest easy nor 
will we close our eyes to sleep before we ensure the freedom of 
all of them so they can contribute to the battle of building our 
national authority and our independent state. We had strongly 
rejected all enemy attempts to divide them or to classify them. 
We had also rejected the freeing of Fatah detainees alone, 
although they were the majority of the detainees and insisted on 
the same treatment for all of them as they are all sons of 
Palestine and the beloved of Palestine. 
  I address you at these difficult moments and ask you to 
stand 
in one [solid] rank to face up to this new situation resulting 
from the attack of the herds of settlers, with the collusion and 
planning of some enemy army units, on the unarmed civilians 
while performing their holy prayers at the holy al-Ibrahimi 
mosque during the blessed month of Ramadan. I appeal to the 
sons of our people everywhere to close ranks and to realize the 
national unity and to be as the heart of one man at time of 
difficulty and trial, for we are the people of martyrs, the 
people of the revolutionaries, the people of Mujahidin, and to 
cast out of their ranks all those who incite sedition and 
division. For despite this dark night the light of dawn is sure 
to come. Dawn and victory is certainly coming. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Israeli soldiers are still escalating their oppression, 
aggression, and crimes that include opening fire on women, 
children, and old people. Israel continues to violate the 
Declaration of Principles, and it is our right to resort to all 
legitimate methods, to retaliate, and to seek favorable 
prospects. (It is our right) to quell the plots by circles 
against peace in the Israeli military establishment, by the 
armed settlers whose hands have been let loose more than at any 
previous time, to cause destruction, and to spread chaos in an 
attempt to stop the wheel of history. 
  We truly want peace but we refuse to surrender. We want just 
peace and we reject surrender and subjugation, just as we refuse 
to transform the peace agreement into an submission agreement. 
I tell you that Palestinian blood will not be cheap. It is the 
blood that lights the flame of our struggle [Jihad] and our 
fight that has not died down and, with God's help, will not die 
down. 
  Because of our loyalty to that blood, we will take all 
measures and stances made necessary by the higher national 
interests for our people. Greetings to all our steadfast sons 
in Hebron and in every corner of our beloved homeland. [passage 
omitted] 
  In these days, during which humanity celebrated 
International 
Woman's Day, on 8 March, the heroic Palestinian woman was 
standing with steadfastness under the ceiling of fire [as 
heard], bidding farewell to the martyrs with ululations and 
confronting the occupiers, their bullets, and their oppression 
with rage and sacrifice. Salutations to the great Palestinian 
woman, and we pledge that she will, in the coming years, 
celebrate her festival in the comfort of a free, independent, 
and democratic homeland for a free and revolutionary people. 
Brothers and sisters, I renew to you the pledge, and I renew to 
you the promise, and I tell you that tragedies will only 
increase our strength, faith, and firmness; the hammer breaks 
the glass, but forms iron [into something useful]. We have made 
quick strides and offered thousands of martyrs, and we will not 
stop the struggle in all its forms before our people receive all 
their rights. Let the victorious march continue; the road to an 
independent state still requires sacrifice, struggle, and 
suffering from us, but it is our will, which cannot be defeated, 
and our determination, which cannot be dented, to do so. 
Blessed be you, O our people; blessed be you, O our people, O 
people of generosity and sacrifice; blessed be you, O people of 
martyrs. [passage omitted] It is revolution until victory.

  [Text] President Yasir 'Arafat has renewed the PLO's 
appeal to the co-sponsors of the peace conference and the 
members of the Security Council to respond to the Palestinian 
people's request for international protection in the occupied 
territories. 'Arafat renewed this appeal when he received 
Jean-Louis Tauran, official in charge of foreign affairs at the 
Vatican, in Tunis yesterday. 
  The Palestinian president also insisted on the need for the 
Security Council to adopt a resolution condemning the massacre 
at the Tomb of the Patriarchs and providing international 
protection for the Palestinian people. In reply to a question 
on the Palestinian response to President Clinton's call for a 
resumption of talks, 'Arafat said that he wants a frank reply 
before making any answer on the Palestinian position on this 
matter. 
  The Palestinian news agency reported yesterday evening that 
President 'Arafat and the Vatican envoy discussed ways of 
strengthening relations between the Palestinians and the Vatican 
and providing international protection for the Palestinian 
people from the attacks and massacres perpetrated by Israeli 
settlers. They also discussed the role of the Vatican in 
supporting the peace process on the basis of safeguarding 
Palestinian rights, particularly the issue of holy Jerusalem, 
which is important to Palestinians, Arabs, Muslims, and 
Christians alike.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political </F>
adviser to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and head of the 
Palestinian delegation to negotiations with Israel, by Sa'id 
Mu'addi, place and date not given; from the "With the Events" 
program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, U.S. President Bill 
Clinton and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin have called on Yasir 
'Arafat to resume the negotiations without preconditions. What 
is your comment? 
  [Sha'th] My comment is that we are not setting impossible 
conditions, nor do we want to delay these negotiations. We are 
aware that these negotiations are our path to a just peace. In 
other words, these negotiations are the way leading to the 
beginning of the Israeli troop withdrawal and the arrival of the 
Palestinian police force. In the long run, this is the genuine 
security tool for our Palestinian people and all regional 
states. We are not setting difficult or impossible conditions. 
We would not have asked for the issuance of a UN Security 
Council resolution setting a mechanism of specific security 
measures if it had not been for this appalling massacre in 
Hebron. Such a resolution could have been issued two weeks ago. 
There has been a two-week delay in the issuance of the 
resolution. Tomorrow, this resolution will be put to the vote. 
Those who want a swift resumption of the negotiations should 
see that this resolution is approved by the UN Security Council 
tomorrow, Friday, so we can begin implementation of the 
mechanism of security measures and so we can return to the 
negotiations. 
  [Mu'addi] What point have the consultations, contacts, and 
efforts to resume the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations reached? 
  [Sha'th] Efforts are continuing on all levels. Contacts were 
held in Tunis last week with Dennis Ross, an Israeli delegation, 
a Russian Foreign Ministry envoy, a Norwegian Foreign Ministry 
envoy, and others. Here in Egypt, too, contacts are being led 
by Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa. Efforts are also continuous in 
Washington. All efforts aim at securing the resumption of the 
negotiations. However, this resumption must be accompanied by 
security measures, which are neither irrelevant, difficult, nor 
impossible. Such measures are necessary to provide security for 
the Palestinian people so we can go ahead with the peace process. 
  [Mu'addi] Is the Palestinian side awaiting the UN Security 
Council resolution and a U.S. response to the Palestinian 
demands? 
  [Sha'th] The issuance of the UN Security Council resolution 
with U.S. approval is a very important matter. This is because 
this resolution includes some executive measures, including the 
responsibility of the United States and Russia in their capacity 
as the cosponsors of the Madrid peace conference, in following 
up the implementation of these measures. Therefore, we believe 
that the issuance of this resolution tomorrow will provide an 
important opportunity for meeting our demand to resume the peace 
process and achieve security at the same time. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
proposed that Palestinian policemen who resigned during the 
intifadah be recalled so that they may be deployed in the Hebron 
area. What is your comment? 
  [Sha'th] As I said before, many of the measures that have 
been taken by Prime Minister Rabin and the Israeli Government 
are part of a sound orientation toward admitting that the 
Palestinian people face a real security problem. However, the 
proposed solutions are not the required ones. For example, 
regarding the Palestinian police force, why should we recall 
previous Palestinian policemen when the Declaration of 
Principles [DOP] we signed in Washington provides for the 
deployment of a Palestinian police force affiliated with the 
Palestinian authority throughout the West Bank and Gaza -- in 
Gaza to implement the agreement and in the West Bank to 
implement so-called early empowerment. We want to see the DOP 
implemented. Its implementation should begin with the immediate 
deployment of the Palestinian police force instead of recalling 
old police personnel, some of whom, anyway, could be fit to join 
the new police. This is desirable. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you very much for this 
interview. 
  [Sha'th] Thank you.

Nun: "Qaddumi Stresses No Return To Negotiations Before 
Measures Are Taken To Protect Palestinian People"] 
  [Excerpts] Washington, New York, London -- President Bill 
Clinton yesterday renewed his urgent call for a resumption of 
the peace process in the Middle East on the Palestinian track 
and the other Arab tracks. He said that he had discussed with 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin the means of returning the 
PLO and Israel to the negotiating table, "because we must not 
allow the enemies of peace to triumph." 
  PLO Political Department Head Faruq Qaddumi (Abu-al-Lutf) 
has 
said in a statement to AL-HAYAH that the PLO will not resume the 
negotiations with Israel until the necessary measures are taken 
to protect the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. 
[passage omitted] 
  Qaddumi told AL-HAYAH over the telephone that the 
Palestinian 
leadership told Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator of the peace 
process, when he came to Tunis that deteriorating conditions in 
the occupied territories and the escalating tension "can only be 
stopped by practical measures on the ground to provide complete 
protection for Palestinian civilians, because the horrific and 
inhuman Hebron massacre has implanted fear and damaged the 
credibility of the peace process as a whole." 
  He stressed that the PLO insists on an international 
presence 
in Hebron as part of the required measures, "but the United 
States continues to hesitate over giving decisive approval to 
the draft Security Council resolution stipulating an 
international presence in all the occupied territories, 
including Hebron." 
  Commenting on Peres' remark that Israel will agree to some 
measures once the PLO agrees to return to the negotiations, 
Qaddumi pointed out that the Palestinian leadership "does not 
trust the promises made by Israeli officials, as Peres has 
already made numerous promises but none of them has been 
fulfilled. And Israel violated the declaration of principles 
agreement and delayed withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho, saying that the dates were not sacred. So we do not 
trust what they say until and unless it is implemented on the 
ground. Because 42 families and four centers must be evacuated 
and moved from Hebron elsewhere, and the presence of 
international forces is a must, as we have said." 
  He also said that the PLO had raised with the U.S. envoy its 
request to put a Palestinian police force into Hebron with the 
international force and to remove the Nitserim [as 
transliterated] settlement in the Gaza Strip, in addition to two 
other settlements -- one near Jericho and the other near Hebron 
itself. 
  Qaddumi revealed that the Palestinian leadership had 
rejected 
a U.S.-Israeli request to hold a tripartite meeting in Tunis 
"between us, Ross, and an Israeli delegation that included Uri 
Safir, director general of the Foreign Ministry, Jaques Neriya, 
and General Uzi Dayan. We refused to do that, lest it be said 
that negotiations were being conducted." 
  He also revealed that the Palestinian leadership had 
rejected 
an Israeli request to hold a meeting between Peres and 'Arafat 
or PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin) in 
Washington. He said: "In return, we asked them to take 
practical measures on the ground before negotiations and after 
the Security Council has adopted a resolution on the Hebron 
massacre. They told us that they were not authorized to give an 
answer, although Peres is so authorized. We told them that 
Peres -- as happened in Oslo, Cairo, and Davos (Switzerland) -- 
has always said that he is `not the boss' but has then gone on 
to the Knesset to claim several victories. It means that the 
Israelis are playing the game of allocating roles and have no 
desire for peace. In fact they are doing their best to win 
further concessions from the Palestinians." 
  Qaddumi said that the Palestinian side had told the Israeli 
envoys that "the Army participated and colluded in the Hebron 
massacre, but they denied it. Then we asked them why it had 
committed a massacre uglier than the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre 
immediately after that took place, claiming the lives of 39 
martyrs. They said that the Army had been tense. So we told 
them that this was an excuse uglier than the crime." 
  He stressed that Ross openly told the Palestinian leadership 
that Washington "cannot approve the Security Council resolution 
until you announce your willingness to return to the 
negotiations, and President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher are pledged to reject any resolution on 
Jerusalem." 
  Qaddumi announced that "most regrettably, we fear that some 
of the reports published by the Israeli press today (yesterday), 
namely that Clinton wants to announce that Jerusalem is the 
capital of Israel [sentence as published]. If that happens, we 
say that the peace process is over. Because it will mean that 
he has violated one of the peace process' foundations and has 
undoubtedly ceased to be an impartial broker with whom we can 
deal." 
  Asked whether his statement meant that the PLO would 
withdraw 
from the negotiations if Clinton announced that Jerusalem was 
the capital of Israel, Qaddumi told AL-HAYAH: "Yes, we would 
withdraw from the negotiations, because Washington would have 
violated the foundations on which they were launched." 
  Qaddumi expects "things to drag on" before the negotiations 
are resumed. "Because Israel is procrastinating and throwing 
dust in people's eyes." 
  Responding to Rabin's announcement of his willingness to 
evacuate the Hebron settlers, Qaddumi said that "if that is 
true, it means fulfilling or trying to fulfill part of the 
requirements for security and peace, which involve disarming the 
settlers and accepting an international presence sponsored by 
the two co-sponsors of the peace process, in order to provide 
protection and safety for Palestinian citizens in the occupied 
territories." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Political Department Chief Faruq </F>
Qaddumi, identified by his nom de guerre Abu-al-Lutf, by radio 
correspondent Salah Salamah, place and date not given; from the 
"Panorama" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Salamah] Brother Abu-al-Lutf, Faruq Qaddumi, head 
of the PLO Political Department: The situation in the occupied 
territory is still exacerbating. Anger still prevails there 
after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The Security Council has 
not yet adopted a resolution condemning the massacre or meeting 
the minimum level of Palestinian demands. U.S. President Bill 
Clinton received Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, but the 
meeting produced nothing that meets Palestinian demands. What 
are your expectations following the Clinton-Rabin meeting? 
  [Qaddumi] After studying and scrutinizing the situation, and 
following the talks between Yitzhaq Rabin and U.S. President 
Clinton, it is clear that Israel does not intend to take 
measures that will provide the necessary protection for our 
people. Therefore, we expect psychological tension to increase 
and fabricated local differences to escalate. The Israeli enemy 
will create seditions and local differences, as it did 
previously when it faced such impasses. It will practice the 
ugliest forms of repression and coercion. It will strike at our 
national unity and social cohesion to cover up the crimes 
committed by the settlers in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. It will 
claim that Palestinians cannot run their own affairs or maintain 
their national security, in order to prolong the occupation and 
to (?implement) its plan in the occupied territory. 
  I believe the overall fabricated incidents that have taken 
place in some areas in the West bank and Gaza over the past few 
months show the Israeli plan to create internal conflicts is 
being implemented. Therefore, we -- as individuals and groups 
inside the occupied territory -- must be patient in tackling the 
local events and not resort to weapons at all in tackling 
political and social differences. Only the Israeli enemy 
benefits from this. 
  [Words indistinct] the entire Palestinian leadership 
categorically rejects the use of weapons against any Palestinian 
citizen and stresses the need to resort to officials and wise 
men to prevent any bloodshed. Prophet Muhammad prevents Muslims 
from fighting each other. 
  Therefore, we expect the Israelis' reaction to be negative, 
because they agreed with the United States not to take any 
measures. This means they are moving toward dealing a blow to 
the whole peace process. There will be no peace in the region. 
  [Salamah] Brother Abu-al-Lutf, Yitzhaq Rabin called from 
Washington, and today from Rome, for a speedy resumption of 
negotiations with the Palestinians. He also stressed the need 
to resume negotiations with Syria and the other Arab parties to 
the peace negotiations. In your view, what are the prospects 
for the Middle East peace process, in light of the available 
facts? 
  [Qaddumi] Yitzhaq Rabin has narrowed the chances for peace 
in 
the region. It seems that, with U.S. consent, he is going ahead 
with his scheme of striking at the political settlement and 
terminating the honest international efforts to boost the peace 
process. He postponed withdrawal and used immense pressure to 
control security at the crossings. Israel does not want peace. 
It continues to devour the land and commit crimes against 
Palestinian citizens. Israel has lost its so-called democratic 
face. It is a racist state, just like South Africa. 
  [Salamah] Brother Abu-al-Lutf, after it surfaced that there 
are major difficulties facing the Oslo agreement and that this 
agreement will not be implemented as scheduled on 13 April, in 
your view, is there a possibility that the Palestinians might 
give up on the Oslo agreement and return to the formula of 
collective Arab dealing with the Middle East peace process? 
  [Qaddumi] What is the point of going ahead with the Oslo 
agreement if Israel violates most of its articles? This cannot 
be called an agreement. They want the Palestinian people to 
succumb. They want to prolong the occupation. Therefore, they 
have torn the agreement into pieces with their heinous behavior 
and their terrorist practices. I believe that after this 
massacre, which has been completely condemned by the world, the 
world has a major responsibility to maintain peace and security 
in the region and to preserve human rights. It must be noted 
that every day, Israel hammers more nails into the coffin of the 
Oslo agreement. Israel proposed the agreement. Now it is 
trying to bury it. 
  [Salamah] What is the alternative, brother Abu-al-Lutf? 
  [Qaddumi] The constant alternative is continued struggle, 
whether or not there is an agreement. As long as an Israeli 
soldier occupies Palestinian territory, it is our right to 
defend ourselves. This is a sacred right approved by 
international law and the UN Charter. 
  [Salamah] Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political 
Department, thank you for this interview with Radio Monte Carlo. 
  [Qaddumi] Thank you, brother Salah.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ghassan al-Khatib, a member of the </F>
Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, in Jerusalem, by 
Fayiz al-Miliji, in Cairo, date not given; from the "Dialogue 
From Afar" program--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Miliji] The visit to the United States by 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has triggered Arab 
reaction. How do the Palestinians view the visit and where do 
they stand on the results that have appeared? 
  [Al-Khatib] First, not all the results of the visit have 
appeared. It is clear that some issues were discussed but not 
publicized. The two sides announced that they agreed on several 
issues, which have not been publicized fully. So it is hard to 
make a final judgment on the outcome of the visit. The results 
announced so far fall short of meeting the minimum demands or 
needs that the Palestinian leadership put forward as urgent 
prerequisites for resuming negotiations and guaranteeing their 
success should they be resumed soon. [passage omitted] 
  The U.S. Government has unfortunately failed to cooperate in 
convincing Israel to respond to these demands. Hence, the 
Israelis are not serious and the U.S. stance backs them. 
  [Al-Miliji] You said that the Palestinian leadership 
conveyed 
these demands. Were they conveyed during the visit to Tunisia 
by Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator of the Arab-Israeli peace 
negotiations? 
  [Al-Khatib] These demands were conveyed earlier, through the 
Palestinian delegation that visited Washington. 
  [Al-Miliji] The delegation that Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat led? 
  [Al-Khatib] Yes. The day after the massacre a meeting was 
held between Dr. 'Urayqat and representatives of the U.S. State 
Department. The demands were conveyed during that meeting. 
They were also conveyed to Dennis Ross, during his visit to 
Tunisia, and were directly conveyed to Rabin more than once. 
  [Al-Miliji] Has the Palestinian leadership received no 
response? 
  [Al-Khatib] It received a reply from Rabin saying that the 
demands concerning settlement cannot be met because this would 
violate the Oslo agreement. He added that the Israeli 
Government would take a set of measures to curb the settlers' 
terrorist activity. These measures were announced later 
following a meeting of the Israeli inner cabinet. 
  [Al-Miliji] What about the U.S. response? 
  [Al-Khatib] There is no direct or material U.S. response. 
The 
U.S. Administration has shown no understanding of these demands. 
But there was no direct rejection. 
  [Al-Miliji] Some believe the PLO can resume the peace 
negotiations and submit these demands for discussion at the 
negotiating table. What do you think? 
  [Al-Khatib] I do not believe this approach will work. To 
return to negotiations without defining the basics that take 
note of the recent tragic experience will again involve us in 
negotiations that waste time uselessly. To make the resumption 
of talks feasible, the bases of the negotiations must be amended 
so that the issues pertaining to settlements can be addressed. 
  [Al-Miliji] We now turn to another topic, that is, honorable 
Jerusalem and the U.S. President's remarks that viewed it as the 
united capital of Israel. This is the first time a U.S. 
President has made such a statement. Do the Palestinians have 
an official stance on that statement? 
  [Al-Khatib] Certainly. First, it constitutes a backing down 
on the previous U.S. stance. In the context of preparations for 
talks, as well as during the talks, the U.S. stance provided for 
postponing discussion of the issue of Jerusalem until the final 
stage. Second, this stance violates and is inconsistent with 
the UN Security Council resolutions and international 
legitimacy. We have recently noticed that the United States has 
tended to take Israel's side. We believe that this complicates 
rather than facilitates negotiations. We believe there should 
be critical reaction, not only by the Palestinians, but also by 
the Arab and Muslim parties, since Jerusalem concerns all Arab 
and Muslim brothers. 
  [Al-Miliji] We thank Ghassan al-Khatib. 
  [Al-Khatib] Thank you.

<F P=106> [By 'Izzat Daraghmah] </F>
  [Excerpt] Jerusalem -- Palestinian leaders and 
personalities in the occupied territories have described the 
U.S. position on the adoption of a Security Council resolution 
condemning the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre on 25 February as a 
position "that is biased and dishonest. The United States 
cannot be accepted as a sponsor of the negotiating process 
because it defends Israel, its positions, and justifications. 
The responsibility for this massacre falls on the Israeli 
Government and Army, which controls all the Palestinian 
territories." 
  Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian negotiating 
delegation in Washington, said: The United States cannot be a 
sponsor of the conference because this requires honesty and 
credibility, and this is what the current U.S. Administration 
lacks. 
  'Urayqat added that delay on the issuing of and voting on a 
resolution condemning the massacre has been caused by the 
position of the United States, Israel's strategic ally. On the 
first day of the massacre, the United States said: "We will see 
you at the Security Council if you are insisting that it issue a 
resolution on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre". However, the 
United States backed down as a result of Israel's recommendation 
and linked the issuance of that resolution with the PLO's 
consent to resume the talks. 
  For her part, Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi, head of the first 
Palestinian juristic organization for monitoring the Palestinian 
authority on human rights, considered the U.S. position as an 
attempt at blackmail by using the Security Council resolution as 
a means to pressure the PLO to return to the talks. 
  She added: The sign that is more serious than all this is 
that, as we are constantly aware, U.S. intervention has always 
been in the Israeli interest and against the Arabs in order to 
give Israel the opportunity to dictate what it wants and to 
protect Israel from the consequences of its actions. Even more 
serious than this is that there are real indications of a shift 
in U.S. policy regarding Jerusalem. I believe that if the 
United States changes the Security Council draft resolution, 
whereby that resolution will become ineffective and useless with 
respect to Jerusalem, and if it uses the veto, this will be 
proof of a grave U.S. challenge to UN resolutions and of a 
fundamental shift in respect to Jerusalem. This will greatly 
alter the credibility of the United States as a sponsor, because 
then it cannot be a neutral sponsor. 
  'Ashrawi stressed that if the Security Council resolution is 
similar to previous ones, there will be no need to issue a new 
resolution. She said that the United States itself is in favor 
of this sort of approach and attitude. 
  Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, head of the reformers in the PLO, 
said: The Security Council resolution stemming from the criminal 
act of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre must contain certain 
requirements, most important of which are providing protection 
for the Palestinian people and achieving credibility. The 
Palestinian people are well aware of this. 
  For his part, Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, head of the Palestinian 
radio and television organization and advisory member of the 
Palestinian delegation, said: We believe that the massacre that 
took place in Hebron represents a grave and bloody threat to the 
safety and security of the Palestinian people in the occupied 
territories. This requires international protection and 
consideration of the PLO's position calling for the presence of 
an international protection able to curb the Jewish settlers and 
extremists, because this has become very necessary. [passage

  [Text] Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi has stated that the results of 
the meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and 
U.S. President Bill Clinton do not constitute a positive 
indication for returning to the negotiating table. Dr. 'Ashrawi 
made these remarks in an exclusive interview with our 
correspondent Kayid Zahir: 
  [Begin recording] ['Ashrawi] In fact, the outcome was what 
we had expected. It was a U.S. attempt to support the Israeli 
position without moving in a practical and effective manner to 
change the situation on the ground. Clearly, the Israeli 
position dominated the Clinton-Rabin summit. The practical 
steps about which President Clinton talked in a general manner 
have not been worked out so far and there are no indications 
that those steps will be translated in practice on the ground. 
  [Zahir] Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi, does the Palestinian side 
support the idea of introducing Palestinian police into Hebron? 
  ['Ashrawi] As we have heard, this is a Palestinian stance by 
the Palestinian leadership. Perhaps with the introduction or 
movement of Palestinian security forces into these areas some 
security will be established, but as we know there is a dual 
law, there is the possibility of settlers using weapons, and 
there is a tense and explosive situation. I do not believe that 
the Palestinian police alone can maintain security and 
stability, but this is a step in the right direction. 
  [Zahir] A step in the right direction despite the fact that 
sovereignty will remain an Israeli sovereignty under the Israeli 
Defense Forces authorities? 
  ['Ashrawi] There cannot be a Palestinian police force or 
security forces bound by an Israeli decision, especially as in 
the accord there are issues relating to the Palestinian police 
and security forces. I do not believe security will be 
established by increasing the Palestinian police, Palestinian 
security forces, or other forces. Security is established by 
addressing the causes of the conflict and the explosion. It is 
clear that the Israeli settlement presence is the main cause of 
instability. 
  [Zahir] What do you think of the Palestinians' boycott of 
the Israeli commission of inquiry? 
  ['Ashrawi] I support the presentation of Palestinian 
evidence before this commission, before any other commissions, 
and before the media and public opinion because the revelation 
of facts is in our interest. We always work publicly and 
overtly and in order to reach the truth, because anyone who 
possesses information cannot benefit from it if that information 
remains with him. This information must be revealed. In my 
opinion, going before this commission is a positive thing. 
  [Zahir] Dr. Hanan, despite the statement by the Supreme 
Islamic Council to boycott this commission? 
  ['Ashrawi] This is a decision by the Supreme Islamic Council 
and we respect their decision, but that does not prevent me from 
expressing my own private opinion. I am expressing my own 
personal view. 
  [Zahir] Maybe there have been Jordanian instructions to the 
Awqaf in East Jerusalem? 
  ['Ashrawi] In my opinion, the decision must be a Palestinian 
one and related to Palestinian interests. Dealing with facts 
responsibly and publicly is fundamental and one must act 
accordingly. [end recording]

  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, March 16 (AFP) -- 
The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas told Jewish settlers to 
leave settlements in the occupied territories quickly or face 
attacks, in a new warning released here Wednesday [16 March]. 
  "The settlers must leave the settlements quickly, otherwise 
our fighters will strike them," the fundamentalist group said in 
a statement. 
  The statement did not set a specific deadline. 
  On March 7 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, the armed wing of Hamas, 
gave settlers until March 15 to leave four settlements in the 
occupied West Bank -- Tekoa, Kyriat Arba', Ar'iel and Keddumim 
-- and Gush Katif in the Gaza Strip. 
  Hamas also declared the 25th of each month to be a day of 
strikes and protests to remember the 30 Palestinian worshippers 
shot dead by an Israeli settler in Hebron's Tomb of the 
Patriarchs on February 25. 
  The fundamentalist group also called on all Palestinians to 
pray at the al-Aqsa mosque in the Old City of Jerusalem on March 
18 in an act of defiance against the Israeli authorities. 
  Since the massacre the army has banned Palestinians from the 
occupied territories from visiting Israel proper.

Out Their Threats"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] sources have stated that the 'Izz-al-Din 
al-Qassam Squads intend to carry out their threats "against the 
occupation presence in the occupied territories" and emphasized 
that implementation of such operations is only a matter of time. 
  The sources made these comments to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT after 
the expiry of Hamas' deadline to the Jewish settlers and 
occupation forces, after which it said it would deal painful 
retaliatory blows to them. It is believed, however, that the 
tightened measures and precautions have made it difficult to 
carry out such operations, particularly as the Israeli 
leadership has taken into consideration the possibility of such 
operations by the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Squads -- the military 
wing of Hamas -- to avenge the martyrs of al-Ibrahimi Mosque in 
Hebron.

  [Text] This afternoon, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and 
Yasir 'Arafat spoke on the phone for 15 minutes. They discussed 
the possibility of resuming the peace talks. Our correspondent 
Shlomo Raz reports that Mr. Rabin initiated the conversation. 
It appears that no Jewish site in Hebron will be evacuated at 
this time. 
  Minister Moshe Shahal estimated today that the talks between 
the PLO and Israel will resume before the Passover holidays 
[starting on 27 March]. Regarding the Waqf decision to ban the 
entry of non-Muslims to the Temple Mount, Minister Shahal said 
that Israel will not accept the Waqf decision, but stressed that 
such disagreements are better solved through silent diplomacy.

  [Text] Washington -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has met 
with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at the White House to 
discuss with him how the stalled Israeli-PLO peace talks, 
suspended in the aftermath of the Hebron massacre, can be 
resumed. President Clinton and Rabin urged PLO Executive 
Committee Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to resume the talks with Israel. 
  In a joint news conference with Rabin at the end of their 
talks yesterday, Clinton said that he believes that 1994 can 
still be the year of peace in the Middle East. He added: We 
are now closer to an agreement than we were a year ago, but 
further away from a peace agreement than we were a month ago. 
  For his part, Rabin urged 'Arafat to end his boycott of the 
talks on Palestinian autonomy in occupied Jericho and the Gaza 
Strip. 
  In a separate development, the spokeswoman for the U.S. 
Embassy in Cairo has asserted that the U.S. stand on the status 
of the occupied city of Jerusalem has remained unchanged. 
  In a statement to the Voice of America radio yesterday, the 
U.S. official denied the statement Israel Radio has attributed 
to U.S. President Clinton, in which he reportedly said that his 
country views the unified city of Jerusalem as the capital of 
Israel. She emphasized that no U.S. official has made such a 
statement.

  [Excerpts] On the eve of the Iranian new year, and on the 
last Friday of 1372 [year ending 20 March], the 
political-religious rites of Friday prayers were staged 
throughout the country today, with the extensive participation 
of the worshiping masses. In Tehran, the Friday prayers were led 
by Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati. 
  The acting Friday prayer leader of Tehran expressed 
congratulations on the occasions of the blessed 'Id al-Fitr and 
the auspicious new year. He stressed that people should use 
such occasions in order to perform good deeds, in particular 
deeds such as giving charity and aid to the poor and the 
underprivileged. [passage omitted] 
  In his second sermon, Ayatollah Jannati thanked the Majles 
for its careful, timely, and skillful debate on the budget bill. 
He then referred to the anniversary of the Halabjah tragedy and 
the silence of international forums, in particular the so-called 
defenders of human rights, on that and other tragedies, such as 
the recent atrocity at the Hebron mosque and the continuing 
criminal acts in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He said: These realities 
show that what is at present being said in the West about human 
rights is nothing but a political ploy. This ploy, however, is 
now old and rotten, and it should be clear to every one now that 
the greatest violator of human rights in the world is in fact 
America. 
  He stressed: Such insinuations do not, and will never, have 
any effect whatsoever on the resolute will of the Muslim nation 
of Iran, and the struggle of the resilient nation of Iran 
against global arrogance will continue under the wise leadership 
of His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Huda al-Husayni from London] </F>
  [Excerpt] THE GUARDIAN today expects Iraq to launch a 
surprise military strike. The British newspaper says: Iraqi 
President Saddam Husayn, who has been quiet for a year, will 
return very soon to his military strategy and deal a lightening 
strike against Western forces inside and outside Iraq. The 
newspaper says: The Iraqi president's patience is coming to an 
end as a result of the embargo imposed by the United Nations 
since his invasion of Kuwait and the exacerbating economic 
situation. This, the paper adds, will prompt him to carry out a 
new bloody adventure. 
  THE GUARDIAN adds that it has been expected recently that 
this adventure will be in the form of a military strike or 
threat against the State of Kuwait or Kurdistan and that this 
strike will take place next week. THE GUARDIAN bases its 
expectations on reports that Iraq is beefing up its Armed Forces 
and deploying them in the North and the South. As a result of 
this, the paper adds, Iraqis are storing food supplies and 
drawing large amounts of money from banks. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tunis, March 18 (AFP)--The Palestinian leadership 
rejected Thursday [18 March] night a US proposal for a meeting 
Sunday between PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shimon Peres, a PLO official told AFP. 
  Samir Ghawshah, a member of the Palestine Liberation 
Organisation's executive committee, said US envoy Dennis Ross 
had made the suggestion in a telephone call to 'Arafat. 
  'Arafat has called for an "urgent" meeting of PLO leaders to 
take stock of the situation after intense diplomatic activity 
this past week. 
  The United States has been trying to persuade the PLO to 
resume talks with Israel on implementing the historic accord on 
limited Palestinian autonomy they signed in Washington last 
September 13. 
  The PLO broke off negotiations after a Jewish settler gunned 
down some 30 Muslim worshippers at prayer in the West Bank town 
of Hebron on February 25. 
  'Arafat on Thursday also received messages from the Russian 
and French governments, spoke by telephone with Egyptian Foreign 
Minister 'Amr Musa and met with Norwegian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Terje Larsen. 
  Ghawshah stressed that the PLO was sticking to its demand 
for 
"the adoption and application of a (United Nations) resolution 
guaranteeing international protection" for Palestinians on the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
  The PLO leadership reiterated its conviction that Jewish 
settlers should be removed from Hebron and that any renewed 
negotiations focus on the status of Jewish settlements in the 
territories. 
  "Our people can no longer trust American promises and will 
never agree to continued negotiations in the present situation," 
Ghawshah said. 
  But he added that the PLO would draft its official position 
following a UN Security Council meeting scheduled for Friday. 
  Ghawshah cited a Norwegian proposal under which joint 
Israeli- Palestinian patrols, supervised by international 
observers, would ensure security for the Palestinians. 
  But he said the idea had been turned down by Israel, which 
would only accept the presence of observers from the 
International Committee of the Red Cross. 
  [In an earlier, related report, Paris AFP in English at 2340 
GMT on 17 March adds the following: "PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
received a message Thursday from Russian leaders handed to him 
by the Russian ambassador to Tunis Boris Shchiborin, the 
Palestinian agency WAFA reported. 
  ["The contents of the message were not specified, but WAFA 
said the two men discussed a UN proposal to provide protection 
for Palestinians in the occupied territories. 
  ["WAFA said 'Arafat and Shchiborin discussed 'contacts made 
to activate a decision by the UN Security Council concerning the 
Hebron massacre.' 
  ["'Arafat also received a message from French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe expressing the 'solidarity and support' of 
France, the current Security Council chairman."]

  [Text] Tunis, 17 Mar (MENA)--Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat has said he can provide no answers regarding the 
Palestinian position on U.S. President Bill Clinton's call to 
the PLO to resume the talks with Israel. 
  Speaking to reporters after meeting Vatican Foreign Minister 
Jean Louis Tauran, 'Arafat said that what is needed is a 
response by the U.S. Administration, the United States [as 
received], and Russia, who are the cosponsors of the peace 
conference, and the Security Council to the just demands of the 
Palestinian people, namely, international protection for our 
children, women, men, masses, and the Islamic and Christian 
sacred places. He added: I ask the U.S. Administration to 
release the Security Council resolution it has been detaining 
for 19 days by not allowing a vote at the Security Council. He 
added: Our people and the rest of the world have a right to 
hear the Security Council opinion on the massacre at the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  'Arafat noted that this massacre committed by extremist 
settlers against worshippers at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque for no 
reason cannot be the work of a mentally disturbed person, as 
Israel says. He asked: The commission of inquiry noted that 
the murderer fired 111 bullets, but how could 111 bullets kill 
or wound over 200 people? 
  'Arafat stressed that more than one person must have 
participated in the crime. He asked: Why didn't the Israeli 
army, which was stationed in front of the mosque when Israel 
took over the place and turned it into a Jewish synagogue, 
interfere? Where were the Israeli guards, who are present night 
and day, at the time of the crime? 
  'Arafat added another question: Are we facing a new secret 
organization within the Israeli Army or is the entire Israeli 
Army involved? I want a clear, explicit answer before I give 
any answers about the Palestinian position, he concluded.

  [Text] A responsible source has said the following: The 
Arab side is committed to peace and to supporting the draft 
Palestinian resolution presented to the UN Security Council on 
the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the required measures in light 
of this massacre, especially those concerning the security of 
Arab citizens in the occupied Palestinian territories, in 
accordance with the stipulations of the draft resolution. This 
draft resolution has been approved by the Arab and Nonaligned 
groups at the UN Security Council and other states. In light of 
the contacts that have been held with U.S. President Clinton, 
and after consultations with some Arab brothers directly 
concerned with this subject, Syria will soon invite the Arab 
parties to the peace process to a meeting to discuss the 
resumption of the peace talks, and to set a date for the 
resumption of talks in April. Syria believes that the odious 
massacre that was committed against defenseless Palestinian 
worshipers in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque and the subsequent death 
and injury of many people affirm to the entire world the need to 
end the Israeli occupation of the occupied Arab territories and 
to arrive at a just, comprehensive peace in accordance with the 
Madrid formula, away from any procrastination and obstacles. 
Syria is of the view that the issuance of the UN Security 
Council resolution by unanimous vote and the resumption of the 
peace talks will bolster the international measures to provide 
protection for our brothers in the occupied Arab territories to 
prevent the recurrence of such spiteful crimes.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: With the adoption of Security Council 
Resolution 904, which strongly condemns the massacre at the holy 
Ibrahimi Mosque and the subsequent killing of Palestinians, and 
which calls for international protection for our kinsfolk in the 
occupied Arab territories, the Middle East peace process has 
been salvaged from the certain collapse planned by Israel. 
  President Hafiz al-Asad held telephone contacts with King 
Husayn of Jordan and Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi. He 
received a telephone call from President Clinton in which the 
peace process and the Security Council resolution were 
discussed. A meeting of the Arab parties in the Washington 
talks is expected to be held soon in order to discuss the 
resumption of these talks. This is in light of international 
developments and the conviction of the peace process cosponsors 
and the entire international community about the importance of 
carrying out intensive efforts to implement the Security Council 
resolution and achieve peace in the region. 
  This is not the first time that Syria has taken the 
initiative and contributed to the rescuing of the peace process. 
It has done so several times, because it sensed, as it senses 
now, a serious international trend to see a just and 
comprehensive solution in the Middle East, based on the 
resolutions of international legitimacy, and leading to a real 
and lasting peace. 
  Security Council Resolution 904 was unanimously adopted. It 
stands as a clear and strong condemnation of Israel and its 
practices. For the first time in the history of the 
Arab-Israeli conflict, the resolution calls for international 
protection for our kinsfolk under occupation. Prominent 
Security Council members demanded that the protection be real 
and broad, and include our kinsfolk in occupied Jerusalem. For 
his part, President Clinton announced that peace with Syria is 
of the utmost importance, and hailed Syria's sincere peaceful 
trends. 
  It is natural that Syria works to employ this international 
trend in the interest of the just and comprehensive peace for 
which it is calling, and in a way that puts Israel to the test. 
Israel should either bow to the will of international peace or 
drop its last mask and face the world's strong criticism and 
whatever measures the international community might take. 
  Undoubtedly, the peace process -- despite Israel's 
intransigence and procrastination -- took an important step 
forward in the adoption of Security Council Resolution 904. Tel 
Aviv's rulers have no excuse for evading the requirements of the 
peace process, especially exchanging land for peace. Israel's 
rulers will no longer be able to use the Arab desires for peace 
as a pretext, because they are the most sincere desires. The 
international community, especially the United States, has felt 
Arab eagerness for peace and Syria's serious contribution to 
repeatedly salvaging of the peace process from collapse as a 
result of Israel's practices and the designs of its rulers. 
  As all admit, peace cannot be made in vacuum, but should be 
based on the resolutions and the objective bases represented in 
Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, and the 
principle of land for peace. In other words, Israel has no 
choice but to return the occupied Arab territories and recognize 
the Palestinian people's national rights. These stand as the 
essence of the Security Council resolutions. Any Israeli delay 
and procrastination designed to evade these resolutions will 
only increase tension in the region, and may lead to new brutal 
actions by Zionist settlers that will be firmly and decisively 
rejected by the international community. 
  If Resolution 904 asks Israel to disarm its settlers, then 
any new criminal action by settlers will surely lead to broad 
international protection in the occupied territories. However, 
Israel is skillful in the arts of procrastination and 
maneuvering. It has been carrying out a large-scale policy of 
deception since 1948. It has always shown a disdain for the 
principles and resolutions of the international community. For 
more than two years, it has been aborting the peace talks in 
Washington. If these talks are expected to produce a just and 
comprehensive solution in the Middle East, the international 
community should place its full weight behind efforts to 
implement its resolutions, support its credibility, and end the 
Israeli occupation. 
  It is important for the international community to double 
its 
efforts so it will not face new Israeli massacres that may 
destroy the whole peace process.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Syria's call for a meeting of the parties to the 
peace process to discuss the resumption of bilateral talks, the 
activation of the stalemated peace process, and the UN Security 
Council resolution condemning the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is 
the focus of today's press commentaries. 
  Under the headline "The Peace Process and the New 
Opportunity," AL-BA'TH says in its editorial: In a new effort 
to activate the stalemated peace process, Syria has called on 
the Arab parties to the peace process to meet to discuss the 
resumption of the bilateral talks. 
  AL-BA'TH stresses that many factors call for this move. 
First, it stresses Syria's commitment to the peace efforts and 
the need to advance the peace process toward its aspired 
objective. Second, it is completely in line with international 
legitimacy. This is because it immediately follows the UN 
Security Council resolution condemning the Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre and calling for the protection of our kinsfolk in the 
occupied territories. Third, the decision to suspend the 
bilateral negotiations was made after coordination among Syria 
and the other Arab parties to protest the Hebron massacre. 
Thus, Syria has reaffirmed its concern for the security of our 
kinfolk in the occupied territories and the need to provide all 
means of protection for them. This is in order to prevent the 
occurrence of any new crimes, which the occupation may commit at 
any moment if it is not deterred by the international community. 
The paper indicates that Syria's decision, which was made after 
intensive Arab and international contacts, will give the peace 
process a new opportunity to achieve its objectives. 
  Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH says that the [UN 
Security 
Council] resolution, one way or another, reflects the 
responsibility of the international community, which rejects 
bloodshed and occupation. This responsibility must be carried 
out by pressuring the Rabin government into responding to the 
requirements of peace. 
  TISHRIN's editorial focuses on the UN Security Council 
resolution, which strongly condemns the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre 
and calls on Israel to confiscate Zionist settlers's weapons. 
The resolution also calls for the protection of the Palestinian 
people and an international presence in the occupied Arab 
territories, as well as stressing the need to continue efforts 
to boost the peace process. 
  TISHRIN says that, belated as it is, the UN Security Council 
resolution is a positive step that will boost the peace process 
and urge Israel to respect the Geneva Conventions and comply 
with the UN Security Council resolutions. The resolution also 
reflects an explicit commitment to the need to protect the 
Palestinian people from the Zionist settlers' acts and 
practices. 
  Referring to the contacts held among President Hafiz 
al-Asad, 
U.S. President Clinton, Lebanese President al-Hirawi, and King 
Husayn of Jordan, TISHRIN says: It is obvious that the U.S. 
Administration is interested in the resumption of the peace 
efforts and that it realizes the dangers of the continued 
Israeli prevarication. Stressing sincere Arab intentions toward 
a genuine just, comprehensive peace in the Middle East, Syria 
has announced that the parties to the Washington talks will soon 
consider the resumption of the talks, which were suspended in 
solidarity with the Palestinian people to express denunciation 
of Israel's appalling crime. The paper adds: The interest in 
continuing the peace process proceeds from the need to put 
Israel to the test, expose its false claims about peace, 
convince the international community to assume its 
responsibilities, and to deduce lessons from two years of futile 
talks in Washington. 
  Concluding its editorial, TISHRIN urges the international 
community to rectify matters and to move after the Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre to confront Israel's ceaseless efforts to 
obstruct the Washington talks. 
  Commenting on the same subject, AL-THAWRAH says that UN 
Security Council Resolution No. 904 condemning the Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre clearly reflects the international community's 
eagerness to enforce its laws and conventions and to prevent 
Israel from continuing its defiance and disregard for 
international legitimacy. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: Hopes are now pinned on a firm 
international will to find an appropriate mechanism for the 
enforcement of the resolution to force Israel to comply with all 
its paragraphs. Past experience has shown that the Israeli 
rulers deal with UN resolutions with disdain and derision, and 
that they will not abandon this provocative course unless there 
is effective pressure to force them to do so. The paper urges 
the influential UN Security Council member states to intensify 
their moves and efforts to ensure the credibility of the 
resolution and to spare it the fate of other resolutions, which 
remained ink on paper without any effect on the ground. 
  AL-THAWRAH says that the circumstances that led to the 
Hebron 
massacre will continue to exist as long as the settlements 
remain in the occupied Arab territories, as long as armed 
settlers are roaming the streets, and as long as they have the 
authority to open fire on Arabs.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] AL-BA'TH today carries an editorial on the peace 
process and the importance of Arab coordination. It says: It 
has been proven beyond a doubt that when there is a unified Arab 
position on basic pan-Arab issues, the Arab nation can score 
major achievements. It has also been proven that any penetration 
of the Arab position from any direction for any reason will 
definitely harm everyone. This is absolutely clear from the Oslo 
agreement and what has followed. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: Had Arab coordination remained as it had been 
at the beginning of the peace talks itwould certainly have been 
in the interest of the Arabs and, consequently, in the interest 
of the establishment of a just, comprehensive peace. 
  AL-BA'TH indicates that what matters now is not when the 
peace talks will resume, but how Israel will comply with the 
resolutions of international legitimacy so that the peace 
process will be brought to a successful end leading to a just, 
comprehensive peace, which is needed in the region. The paper 
believes that the responsibility for achieving this lies with 
the cosponsors of the peace process, specifically the United 
States, being the initiator of the peace process. 
  AL-BA'TH stresses Syria's readiness to continue peace 
efforts. It indicates that Syria has offered all that is 
possible to ensure the continuation of that process in order to 
arrive at a comprehensive solution. 
  Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: When Syria called for a meeting 
of the Arab parties directly concerned with the peace process, 
it did so out of its faith in joint Arab action and its absolute 
realization that coordination and faithful commitment will 
thwart any Israeli attempt to effect another penetration like 
the Oslo agreement. Besides, coordination in itself can achieve 
at least a minimum level of Arab aspirations. 
  In an editorial on the UN Security Council resolution on the 
Hebron massacre and the chance that the resolution has provided 
for the resumption of the peace talks, TISHRIN says: 
Undoubtedly, UN Security Council Resolution 904 on the Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre has provided a new opportunity to resume the 
peace talks. In turn, this will boost the international 
arrangements and measures to protect our Palestinian Arab people 
in the occupied territories, and will prevent the recurrence of 
spiteful crimes and massacres by the settlers with the support 
of the Israeli Army against the Palestinian citizens in the 
occupied territories. 
  TISHRIN continues: The Hebron massacre and the subsequent 
confrontations and events have proven to the entire world the 
need to end the Israeli occupation and to arrive at a just, 
comprehensive peace in accordance with the Madrid conference 
formula away from any procrastination and obstacles. Thus, 
Israel must adopt practical measures to protect and ensure the 
security of the Palestinians. We also demand that it disarm the 
settlers, give up its provocative and extortionist stands, and 
seriously contribute toward activating the peace process by 
recognizing the facts and objectives of this process and 
responding to the UN resolutions, the Madrid conference formula, 
and the principle of trading land for peace. 
  TISHRIN adds: Undoubtedly, the chances that were provided 
for the peace process, particularly during the talks, have been 
greatly narrowed after the Hebron massacre. Safeguarding the 
peace process and extricating it from the impasse to which it 
has been driven requires, more than ever before, a public 
Israeli acknowledgement in advance that only a full withdrawal 
from the occupied Arab territories can ensure the achievement of 
a just, comprehensive peace and regional security, stability, 
and calm. 
  TISHRIN stresses Syria's eagerness to continue coordination 
among the Arab parties to the peace process and its call for a 
meeting for consultations prior to the resumption of the talks. 
The paper explains that the Arabs, especially Syria, have 
always been advocates of right and justice, seriously and 
honestly working to achieve a just, comprehensive peace. 
However, Israel has met all this with nothing but more 
maneuvers and circumvention of the objectives of peace. Had 
Israel been, like the Arabs, serious at the Madrid conference 
and had it showed commitment to the formula of that conference, 
the Hebron massacre would not have taken place and all this 
violence and terrorism would not have prevailed in the occupied 
territories, which have turned into battlefields in which Arab 
citizens are being slaughtered by the gunfire of the occupiers. 
Nor would southern Lebanon have suffered destruction, 
bombardment, and displacement of its population as a result of 
the brutal Israeli aggressions. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: While awaiting the true and full 
implementation of Resolution 904, it must be emphasized that 
Israel is required, now more than ever before, to respond to all 
bases and requirements of peace, headed by full withdrawal from 
the occupied territories. Securing such an Israeli response is 
both an international and a U.S. responsibility.

  [Text] The Syrian Arab side led by Interior Minister Dr. 
Muhammad Harbah, and the Lebanese side led by Interior Minister 
Bisharah Mirhij, held a round of talks at noon today attended by 
members of the two delegations. 
  At the start of the meeting, Dr. Harbah welcomed Mirhij and 
his delegation. He noted the steps and measures already 
realized in security cooperation and coordination and border 
activities, especially in immigration, passports, and customs. 
He emphasized Syria's eagerness to develop bilateral 
cooperation in the operation of the two ministries in the 
interests of the Arab people of the two sisterly countries and 
in implementation of the Brotherhood, Cooperation, and 
Coordination Treaty. 
  Bisharah Mirhij then thanked Dr. Harbah and the members of 
the Syrian delegation. He hailed the bilateral fraternal 
relations and cooperation. He emphasized his ministry's 
eagerness to implement all the agreements signed by the two 
countries, especially in the field of security cooperation. 
  The two sides discussed all issues relating to the 
activities 
of the two ministries and ways to develop them in the interest 
of citizens of both countries. They expressed satisfaction with 
the measures recently adopted by the two sides in the field of 
internal affairs. 
  The officials talks concluded this afternoon. They were 
attended by Nasri Khuri, secretary general of the 
Syrian-Lebanese Higher Council and members of both delegations. 
The two sides signed the joint meeting minutes. These allow 
Lebanese citizens who do not carry passports or identity cards 
to enter Syria using individual registration certificates issued 
by competent authorities. 
  In order to complete the steps and measures adopted by 
previous meetings of the two ministries, it was agreed to 
facilitate movement across borders in response to the desire of 
citizens in the two sisterly countries. As a result, the Syrian 
Arab side presented designs for a building for borders 
authorities of both sides. The designs were presented to the 
Lebanese side for study and comment. 
  The minutes also include facilitating the stay of citizens 
in 
both countries. The minutes of meetings held in Damascus on 27 
April 1993 were emphasized. The minutes approved reciprocity 
concerning the stay of Syrian citizens in Lebanon and Lebanese 
citizens in Syria. 
  Harbah and Mirhij exchanged fraternal speeches on this 
occasion. They expressed their pleasure at signing the minutes. 
They emphasized that the steps agreed on concerning bilateral 
relations are absolute evidence of the close relations between 
the two countries in all fields, in implementation of the 
instructions of leader President Hafiz al-Asad and President 
Ilyas al-Hirawi. 
  The Lebanese minister left Damascus this evening.

  [Text] On the 16th anniversary of Security Council 
Resolution 425, President Ilyas al-Hirawi has emphasized that 
Lebanon looks to the UN to help everybody implement the 
international resolutions. Lebanon, he added, has proved its 
ability to overcome its crisis and is able to extend the state's 
authority to every inch of its territory. 
  President al-Hirawi added that Lebanon, which seeks UN help 
to safeguard its inalienable rights, rejects violence as a way 
of resolving crises just as it rejects infringement of its 
national dignity and legitimate rights. He added: Resolution 
425 did not give us a right we were not entitled to. Rather, it 
reaffirmed our sacred right to have our sovereignty respected. 
  The president added: Let Israel withdraw from our land and 
the state will take it upon itself to maintain stability there. 
He stressed the need for alertness and solidarity with our 
brothers and cooperation with our friends to secure the 
implementation of the international resolutions, chiefly 
Resolution 425.

  [Text] For the second time in less than 48 hours, forces of 
the Lebanese Army entered the central administrative 
headquarters of the Lebanese Forces Party in Zuq Mikha'il at 
1200 today. Army personnel forced the administrative officials 
to leave the building and prevented anyone from entering it. 
  Meanwhile, a Lebanese Army unit entered the students' 
building in Tabarja today. Our radio tried in vain to contact 
the party's central headquarters to inquire about the situation 
there.

  The following statement was issued a short time ago by the 
Army command: 
  Within the context of the on-going investigations into the 
recent explosions, particularly the Sayyidat al-Najat Church 
bombing in Zuq Mikha'il, units from the army were this afternoon 
given the task of raiding some positions and sites in Zuq and 
Tabarja where preliminary investigations have shown that they 
were used as centers and a cover-up for some of these 
activities. The aforementioned units were also put in charge of 
these sites and tasked with putting them at the disposal of the 
investigations until further notice.

  [Text] In a statement to AL-HAYAH newspaper, Dr. Samir 
Ja'ja' said: I again reject any direct or indirect hints or 
accusations of the Lebanese forces for bombing the Sayyidat 
al-Najat Church. He said that those who make these accusations 
are unscrupulous criminals who want to cover up their actions by 
accusing us. These accusations are rumors and are not based on 
evidence [words indistinct]. 
  Ja'ja' said that under the pretext of investigations, an 
organized political campaign of suppression is launched. The 
campaign is now aimed against the Lebanese forces and it will be 
aimed against other parties tomorrow. 
  According to press reports, Dr. Ja'ja' made two telephone 
calls to President Ilyas al-Hirawi and Chamber of Deputies 
Speaker Nabih Birri inquiring about the reasons for the raids on 
the Lebanese Forces centers and requesting them to intercede to 
stop this campaign.

  [Text] Lebanese Forces [LF] Commander Samir Ja'ja' said at 
a news conference that certain security and military units 
raided two LF headquarters in Zuq Mikha'il and the al-Nubin Club 
center which they had raided two days ago and forced the 
officials there to leave the buildings. He said that after 
contacts with a number of officials, we opted to keep silent for 
a while and to allow quiet diplomacy to resolve the issue so 
that it may not be misinterpreted. We maintained this stance 
because we believe that through dialogue, understanding, and 
discussions we may find serious solutions to all problems, 
whereas other means would lead nowhere. 
  Ja'ja' said that certain state officials began about 10 days 
ago to point the finger at the LF as responsible for the bombing 
of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church and other bombings. He wondered 
if it is possible to try a case before a court hearing even 
begins. He pointed out that the recent statement issued by the 
Internal Security Forces Directorate looks as if the explosive 
charge was prepared at the LF main headquarters. He asked: If 
this is true, is it possible to occupy the center? He said that 
the case should be referred to the judiciary to hear the case 
and hand down a verdict, because accusing people falsely is 
inadmissible. 
  Ja'ja' stressed that the LF, as always, will side with 
justice to the end. He pointed out that the LF has offered 
10,000 martyrs in defense of churches in all Lebanese areas, and 
wondered if it is reasonable for the LF to bomb a church 
anywhere. 
  Ja'ja' noted that what is happening these days may be the 
last link in a chain before suppressing political freedoms in 
Lebanon. He said: As for me, the situation is very clear. 
Every time a security incident occurs, it is used as a pretext 
to take further security measures to apply more pressure on the 
opposition parties, individuals, and politicians instead of 
hunting down the perpetrators. 
  He wonders if political opposition is not allowed in 
Lebanon. 
If it is not allowed, he said, let them say so clearly so that 
everyone will shoulder his responsibilities. He added: We set 
forth our basic demand at the first news conference we held 
after the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church: We want to 
learn who bombed the church. He hoped that the state would find 
the perpetrators. He said that the judiciary will decide this; 
otherwise, why do countries take judicial measures in such 
cases? He said: We truly wish that the case be referred to the 
judiciary to hand down its verdict. 
  Ja'ja' said that the bombing of the church led to the 
deployment of security forces in LF centers and surrounding 
Ghidras [LF headquarters], although the investigations for the 
past 10 days have not led to the bombers. He called for finding 
the culprits responsible for the crime of bombing the church and 
proceeding with judicial measures to find the culprits.

  [Text] Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri has told AL-NAHAR 
that investigations into the church bombing are taking their 
natural course. There are no doubts regarding the measures that 
have been taken or regarding the fairness and honesty of the 
judicial system. The media should not pressure the judiciary, 
because investigations continue and justice will inevitably take 
its course. The prime minister added: The authorities must 
adhere to all the measures that are taken. The judiciary must 
be given enough time to investigate the minute details. This is 
why the issue is proceeding according to judicial protocol and 
within the authority of the law. Answering a question, he said: 
Attempts to destroy the security and political situation in the 
country are directed at the whole country's unity and civilian 
security. But these attempts have not succeeded, praise be to 
God, he said. 
  In an interview with AL-DIYAR, Prime Minister al-Hariri 
announced that the Cabinet will meet on 23 March. He noted that 
the results of investigations into the Zuq Mikha'il explosion 
will be announced when a decision is made. He said the 
deployment of the Army in two Lebanese Forces positions is 
linked with the investigations into the church bombing. He 
added that all the steps taken proceed from the judicial 
stipulations followed in the Lebanese state. 
  Al-Hariri said there is complete cooperation among the 
executive authorities and their various organs as well as 
understanding over the methods of handling this situation in 
accordance with the legal bases and laws. 
  The prime minister continued: We are facing real dangers 
from Israel, which is lurking in the shadows. He said the 
current situation is crucial. It is now time for us to stand 
alongside our country. It is time for citizens to stand beside 
Lebanon. We know the true direction of the compass -- 
reconstructing Lebanon and continuing the march of development. 
My belief in Lebanon is great. Despite the very difficult 
times, my belief has never waned. We will continue to rebuild 
and grow, to rebuild the state, the prime minister said.

  [Text] Citing one of the top three leaders [president, 
Chamber speaker, prime minister], the newspaper AL-HAYAH reports 
today that the network involved in the bombing of the Sayyidat 
al-Najat Church has direct links to Israel, noting that the 
network leaders are linked to a local militia. The paper says 
that the network leaders had often visited the security strip 
and a European capital. 
  According to the top leader, AL-HAYAH says that the 
investigations into the incident will inevitably confirm whether 
party and militia leaders are involved in the bombing, 
particularly since the group leader, who probably has escaped to 
the Jazzin area in the security strip, was in charge of security 
affairs in a local influential militia in the Kasrawan region. 
The group leader, according to AL-HAYAH, is a relative of a 
prominent party leader. 
  AL-HAYAH also cites official sources as saying that the 
initial stage of the preparation of the explosives was conducted 
in Sinn al-Fil before the culprits moved to the Zuq area. The 
culprits then used a party center, which has often been raided, 
to assemble the explosive devices before planting them in the 
church.

<F P=106> [Statement by Information Minister Michel Samahah at the </F>
Ba'bda Palace on 16 March-- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] The Council of Ministers held an extraordinary 
meeting under his excellency the president of the Republic. The 
meeting was attended by the prime minister and the ministers. 
  At the beginning, the president reviewed the situation in 
the 
country, focusing on events before and after the explosion in 
the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il and the local and 
regional atmosphere accompanying this crime. The president 
emphasized the critical stage through which the country is 
passing and the need to mobilize every effort to reinforce 
national unity and the peace process in the face of any action 
against them and against internal stability. He stressed the 
sovereignty of Lebanese law and its application throughout the 
liberated Lebanese territory. 
  The prime minister then briefed the Council on security 
reports regarding the situation in the country and the measures 
adopted by the Internal Security Council, a meeting of which he 
chaired on 15 March to reinforce the security situation and 
confront every attempt to undermine national stability. 
  The Council of Ministers discussed the conditions in the 
country in light of the review presented by the president and 
the prime minister on the premise that Lebanese law and 
legitimate institutions and their services entrusted to 
implement the law are the authority for imposing security and 
implementing Lebanese law in every Lebanese area. The Council 
reconfirmed its decisions at previous sessions to empower the 
security services to deal with every emergency incident designed 
to undermine security, stability, and the establishment of state 
authority. It also confirmed all the measures adopted at the 
meeting of the Internal Security Council yesterday in 
implementation of the Council of Ministers' decisions. [passage

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the office of President Lamine Zeroual </F>
on 18 March] 
  [Text] In his address to the nation, President Lamine 
Zeroual put the emphasis on dialogue and described it as the 
best method and way to deal with the situation and the basis for 
political action in the country, since this dialogue constitutes 
one of the main points included in the platform adopted by the 
national conference. In this context, as from next week the 
president of state will start talks with national figures, 
political parties and social and economic organizations. This 
dialogue has been defined in the various statements made by the 
president of state as being an honest dialogue from which no one 
who respects the Constitution will be excluded; and a 
constructive dialogue that will bring together all Algerians who 
are concerned about the continuity of the state and the 
interests of the people. 
  The purpose of this dialogue is to ensure Algeria's revival 
and to return to the rule of the people's choice in an 
atmosphere of clarity and continuity. 
  Moreover, the state is endeavoring with determination to 
solve the country's current problems out of its resolve to serve 
an effort that requires more deeds than words. Due to the 
speedy nature [as heard] of the security situation, the mission 
of the security forces, which is to ensure the safety of the 
citizens and their property and eradicate the terrorist 
violence, needs to continue relentlessly. This mission is 
carried out with a spirit of self- denial and sacrifice by those 
who are in charge of leading it and executing it on the ground. 
  The government is also continuously committed to tackling 
economic and social problems in the framework of the directives 
given by the president of state during the first meeting of the 
Council of Ministers on 27 February. It is obvious that this 
effort to restore our economy requires a commitment from the 
entire nation and its mobilization through the organizations 
representing it. 
  Thus, the national dialogue, which the president of state is 
intending to resume, falls within the framework of a number of 
integrated and well-ordered actions. This dialogue will 
undoubtedly provide appropriate conditions for the emergence of 
a national consensus that will bring together all the Algerians 
who love their homeland and who adhere to patriotic values, the 
ideals of the eternal 1 November Revolution and the principles 
of our Constitution. This consensus will enable Algeria to 
confront the various pressing challenges facing it. It will 
also enable it to achieve the goals of the transitional period; 
these goals were and will remain: Civil peace, democracy, and 
prosperity.

  [Text] In a statement, Prime Minister Redha Malek said that 
the advent of Lamine Zeroual as the head of the state will 
contribute toward clarity and will reinforce the adhesion and 
coordination between the major state institutions. In contrast, 
the media and their comments are inadvertently playing the role 
of representative to those political circles which are incapable 
of providing an objective and constructive analysis. 
  These media commentators are under the impression that they 
have sensed some kind of difference in approach or even in the 
manner between the attitude of the head of state and the 
behavior of the government. The premier adds: On the contrary, 
I would like to stress in this respect and in a prudent manner 
and without ambiguity, that there is firm and complete 
coordination in the perception and in the work between the head 
of the state and myself. The continuous and determined struggle 
of the Algerian state against barbaric terrorism concerns all 
state institutions, and the same is true in respect of the 
political work aimed at establising a serious dialogue with all 
those partners who reject violence and accept the principles of 
national unity and the constitutional system. This political 
work is the concern of the head of the state and of the 
government. 
  In his statement, the head of government says: The head of 
state is the one who advocates the method that leads to the 
creation of a structured and effective economy, and to the 
management of Algeria's foreign financial obligations. The head 
of state also coordinates and leads that effort. 
  In conclusion, the head of government adds: Indeed, the 
political situation is complicated and I therefore urge the 
information media and those who formulate public opinion to be 
vigilant. We must fight the process of deception used by 
terrorism, in addition to other means, to kill and slaughter 
Algerians from all segments of society, and eradicate it. 
  The Algerian state remains strong, united, and determined. 
The protection of society and saving Algeria is a sacred 
patriotic duty. Matters are clear: The people's rejection and 
banishment of terrorism clearly stipulate the unwaivering 
condemnation of those who work to create confusion in order to 
maintain instability and mix up.

  [Text] The General Staff of the People's National Army has 
issued a statement this evening on the recent reports circulated 
by the press regarding the existence of a rift in the positions 
of the People's National Army toward the current political 
options. Details of the statement from my colleague Nacera 
Bouzid: 
  [Bouzid] The statement by the General Staff of the People's 
National Army says that however legitimate the preoccupations of 
public opinion on this subject, such calculations are mistaken 
and it will once more be impossible for the People's National 
Army to fail again in its duty of reiterating, without 
ambiguity, the spirit of responsibility with which it is 
endowed. 
  The People's National Army, which is not unaware that these 
imaginary differences are intentionally propagated and 
circulated by certain sources and circles with the aim of 
causing harm, insists on reassuring public opinion and the vital 
national forces that the Army will fulfill the obligations 
already announced toward the institutions of the state, the 
Constitution, the options, and the recommendations sanctioned by 
the National Conference. 
  The Armed Forces' public role, the statement added, is to 
remain under the orders of the state authority, which exercises 
political power. 
  As far as speculations, which were the outcome of the 
political initiative [dialogue with other forces] were 
concerned, the People's National Army, with all its formations, 
cannot but reiterate its confidence in the head of state 
performing his sensitive task. 
  Concerning the criminal acts of terrorism and sabotage that 
the country and the population have been suffering daily, it is 
clear, the statement pointed out, that they are two diseases 
that cannot under any circumstances be accepted by the Algerian 
state. The People's National Army will, therefore, continue, 
together with all other security services, forces, and the 
population to fight them regardless of the price in order to 
restore security, stability, and tranquillity and to protect a 
republican, democratic, pluralist state that guarantees basic 
national values, as well as individual and collective rights and 
freedoms.

  [Text] Islamabad, March 18 (AFP) -- Washington is showing 
signs of rapprochement with Islamabad in talks on the issue of 
nuclear non-proliferation and is reconsidering a ban on military 
sales to Pakistan, the Foreign Ministry said. 
  The talks have raised concern in New Delhi that closer 
relations between Washington and Islamabad could lead to an 
upset of the regional power equation. 
  A Pakistani Foreign Ministry official said here Thursday 
that 
Washington and Islamabad were engaged in "deep dialogue" on the 
subject of nuclear non-proliferation, a priority of US foreign 
policy in the region. 
  Neither Pakistan nor traditional rival India, which exploded 
a nuclear device in 1974, are signatory to the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty and both suspect the other of 
developing atomic weapons. 
  The ongoing US-Pakistan talks coincide with reports of the 
willingness of the US administration to partially lift a ban on 
military and economic aid to Pakistan which was imposed in 
October 1990 following fears that Islamabad had embarked on a 
nuclear weapons program. 
  The ban was implemented under provisions of the Pressler 
amendment, named after US Senator Larry Pressler, which forbids 
military aid to Pakistan unless the president could certify 
Islamabad did not have nuclear weapons and was not trying to 
develop them. 
  But US officials on Tuesday said Washington may ease the ban 
to enable the delivery of 71 F-16 jet fighters, which were 
ordered from General Dynamics but suspended when the ban took 
effect, in return for a "verifiable" pledge that Pakistan will 
halt its nuclear program. 
  Islamabad has already paid for 38 of the aircraft. 
  Delivery of the aircraft would boost Pakistan's 
deteriorating 
air force, which is equipped with some 100 Mirage jets, about 
100 Chinese-made F6 and F7 aircraft and 34 F-16s. 
  (In New Delhi, India's Air Chief Marshal S.K. Kaul was 
quoted 
Friday by The Statesman daily as saying that the "balance of 
power" in the region would change if Pakistan acquired the 
aircraft, whose long ranges enable them to carry out deep strike 
attacks. 
  ("Those machines have been manufactured and are lying there. 
I have always maintained that they (the United States) will find 
some way of overcoming the Pressler amendment," the daily quoted 
him as telling reporters at a news conference in Bombay. 
  (The Indian air force chief did not spell out exactly how 
the 
military balance would be upset if Pakistan were to acquire the 
planes. 
  (He however spoke about India's difficulties in upgrading 
its 
Russian-built MiG-21 planes because of Russian reluctance to 
part with technology information following the breakup of the 
Soviet Union. 
  (His remarks followed concern expressed by Foreign Minister 
Dinesh Singh at the US proposal to dispatch the F-16s to 
Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars since 
independence in 1947. 
  ("Does the United States want to encourage Pakistan to use 
nuclear weapons against India?" Dinesh Singh said this week. 
  Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, shortly after 
assuming office in October last year, said that former premier 
Nawaz Sharif had "capped" the country's nuclear programme and 
that she had decided to maintain that position. 
  A late Thursday report, quoting sources close to the foreign 
office, reiterated Islamabad's position and assured the 
Pakistani public that "any step taken will safeguard the 
national interest." 
  The report also claimed that the Pressler amendment had 
failed to achieve its objective of preventing arms 
proliferation, but had managed to contribute to Pakistan's 
conventional arms capabilities being "eroded.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Turning Up the Heat on India"] </F>
  [Text] The statement by US Secretary of State, Warren 
Christopher, that India will not receive any concessions for its 
nuclear programme, will have been received in Islamabad with 
considerable relief. Christopher told a House subcommittee on 
appropriations that the US is pursuing an even-handed policy in 
South Asia, after Congressman James Moran asked some questions 
about Indian violation of human rights in occupied Kashmir and 
East Punjab. In recent months, the American in South Asia, and 
keeping a careful eye on relations between Pakistan and India. 
American policy-makers clearly see the region as a potential 
flash point, and have appointed a senior State Department man, 
Strobe Talbott, to watch the situation. Though generally 
considered an expert in US- Soviet relations, Talbott has 
probably been asked to observe the Pakistan-India situation 
because of his expertise in nuclear strategy and confidence 
building techniques between two hostile parties. Talbott is 
expected to visit Pakistan and India next month. 
  Talbott's new assignment is a clear indication of how 
seriously Washington is viewing the tension in South Asia. The 
worst nightmare for the American administration is a 
conventional confrontation between South Asia's two largest 
powers, which could escalate into a nuclear conflict. 
Christopher told the House sub-committee that the US wanted 
India to cap its nuclear programme, which India insists is for 
peaceful purposes despite concrete evidence that it is forging 
ahead not only with the development of nuclear weapons 
technology, but is also perfecting an indigenous delivery 
system. But the key difference between Pakistan and India, 
vis-a-vis the Pressler Amendment, which applies only to Pakistan 
and not to India, was a subject that Mr Christopher did not 
comment on when asked to do so by Congressman Moran. If the 
United States is truly committed to an equal, even-handed 
approach to the two countries, then the application of the 
Pressler Amendment to Pakistan will have to be examined. 
  New Delhi will have received the new about Christopher's 
statement with frigidity and some trepidation. There were also 
some questions about human rights violations in occupied Kashmir 
and Punjab to which Mr Christopher acknowledged that there were 
more "problems" in Indo-US relations are likely to deteriorate 
in this regard. There have been discernible shifts in US 
foreign policy regarding India over the past few months and it 
is becoming increasingly clear that American administration is 
no longer as gullible as it used to be. Pakistan had felt 
singled out by the US on several counts, with the general 
impression being that Washington was inclined favourably towards 
India on various issues. While Pakistan is still not off the 
hook, India is no longer being treated with myopic favouritism. 
A balanced American initiative in South Asia could go a long 
way in defusing the tension in the region. The key issue will, 
of course, be how even-handed American policy really will be. 
Anything less will be unacceptable and equally unsuccessful.

  [Text] Pakistan has greatly succeeded in attracting world 
public opinion toward atrocities being committed by India in 
occupied Kashmir. This was stated by Foreign Secretary 
Shaharyar Khan while addressing a function in Lahore last night. 
He categorically stated that Pakistan has not withdrawn its 
resolution on Kashmir from the UN Human Rights Commission and 
has agreed only to defer the voting on the resolution, which is 
still effective and can be taken up at any time. 
  Appreciating the Islamic Conference Organization's [ICO's] 
support on the Kashmir issue, the foreign secretary said the ICO 
has unanimously approved resolutions on Kashmir five times in 
the past. These resolutions have greatly helped to generate 
sympathies for the Kashmiri people, who are waging a struggle to 
achieve their right of self-determination. 
  Shaharyar Khan said India cannot renege on its promise to 
allow a visit of a mission comprised of envoys from Islamic 
countries to assess the repression committed in occupied 
Kashmir. He disclosed that Iranian President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani's special emissary is arriving in Islamabad 
today to discuss this particular issue. He said India's 
acceptance of this proposal is on record.

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali </F>
on 18 March, place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
Citizens, men and women. Following the conclusion of the 
presidential and legislative elections campaign, polling begins 
on 20 March, the anniversary of Independence Day. In the 
context of my own following up of the electoral campaign and 
preparations for polling day, I noticed two things: 
  First, some political parties have designated only a few 
monitors in polling stations despite the fact that we extended 
the official deadline by 24 hours for them. What is regrettable 
is that they have not remedied the situation. 
  As for the second matter, for which municipalities and 
sub-municipalities are responsible, it concerns the distribution 
of voting cards. I gave firm instructions that citizens be 
informed of the need to register their names in the electoral 
lists, and to enable them to ascertain this registration in the 
reviewing period so as to avoid any mistake, overlooking or 
omission. I also ordered that they be given enough time beyond 
the registration deadline to register and remedy the situation. 
Furthermore, I instructed the relevant authorities on the 
municipal and sub-municipal level to be careful to prepare the 
voter registration cards properly, so as to avoid all types of 
mistakes with names and addresses, and to make sure that it is 
sent or handed to them within the deadline, before voting 
starts. It has come to my attention that some voters have not 
received their cards either because their names are not on the 
lists -- in spite of their assurance that they had registered 
their names previously -- or because of a mistake with the names 
and addresses, or merely because of a failure in distribution. 
  Cases like this contradict our desire to enable everyone who 
has the right to take part in the elections to carry out that 
right, which is guaranteed in the constitution and the law. It 
also does not give a positive image of the work of the 
municipalities -- which I have always reaffirmed are the first 
school for democracy, and for the development of the civic 
spirit, and for the kindling of the sense of citizenship in the 
nation -- in addition to it hurting the image of the 
administration in the mind of the citizen. 
  I place full responsibility for any failure, if this is 
proved to be the case, on the municipal leaders and their 
general secretaries. To avoid such a situation, I have given 
instructions to the Interior Ministry to take note of this 
matter in the time remaining before the beginning of voting by 
taking the necessary measures to enable all voters to receive 
their cards. 
  Fellow citizens, to vote is not a mere formality nor is it 
an 
obligation, but it is a patriotic duty and a civil right 
represented by the casting your vote in favor of whoever you see 
as eligible to represent you at the House of Deputies. It is 
also a right and a duty to underline the involvement in and 
positive response to the national cultural project -- a large 
part of which we have accomplished -- and a great deal is 
expected from it due to the legitimate aspirations and the 
challenges which we should overcome with God's help. 
  The joined daily effort to which we adhered as a principle 
and a value, begins from the voting process itself. To let our 
people practice this responsibility, having reached a high 
degree of maturity, rationality, and eligibility for an 
organized and developed political life, the administrative 
bodies should facilitate the performance of this duty and the 
practice of this right to everyone by providing them with the 
legal means namely the electoral card. 
  It is, at the same time, the main precondition for the 
involvement of everyone with renewable impetus, sincere resolve, 
and a high spirit of responsibility in the new take-off with 
which we are preparing our country to occupy the highest status 
in continuation of what we started on 7 November [1987]. 
  Peace and God's mercy and blessings be upon you.

  [Text] Successive announcements have been made since dawn 
today on the results of the presidential and legislative 
elections that took place yesterday, Sunday. Interior Minister 
Abdallah Kallel will officially announce the results at a news 
conference this afternoon. As a reminder, the turnout at these 
elections was unparalleled with more than 90 percent of voters, 
men, and women, taking part in the vote in the 25 electoral 
districts. The presidential elections were marked by an 
absolute popular plebiscite for President Zine El Abidine Ben 
Ali; the percentage of the vote for President Zine El Abidine 
Ben Ali exeeded 99 percent and this rate reached 100 percent in 
Tataouine. 
  As for the legislative elections, the lists of the 
Democratic 
Constitutional Rally won in all districts with an extremely high 
percentage of votes, but these results will assuredly lead to 
the entry of the other parties into the chamber of deputies for 
the first time in the history of Tunisia due to the amendment to 
the electoral code, which guarantees the presence of these 
parties in parliament.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Prime Minister's Firm Stand"] </F>
  [Text] If U.S. Senator Larry Pressler is quoting Indian 
Prime Minister Narasimha Rao correctly and if the prime minister 
is not refuting his claims, then Rao's assertions on defense 
policy can be described as the most important statement of his 
term -- the most important because the statement is directly 
related to India's nuclear policy. Since the prime minister has 
explained his viewpoint to Pressler and spoken on the 
controversy currently raging in the United States on the 
Pressler Amendment, there can be no other meaning to his alleged 
statement. After assuming the reins of power, the Clinton 
administration has tilted so much toward Pakistan that the 
President -- restless to resume military aid to Pakistan -- 
considers the Pressler Amendment as a thorn in his way. The 
amendment provides that Pakistan will not be eligible to receive 
U.S. military aid unless and until the U.S. President certifies 
that Islamabad is not pursuing its program to manufacture an 
atom bomb. It was on this very ground that the former President 
George Bush had stopped military aid to Pakistan. It will now 
be difficult for Clinton to certify, contrary to his 
predecessor's decision, that Pakistan is not pursuing a nuclear 
bomb program. In the meantime, contrary to the above, many 
facts have come to light that dispel any doubts about Pakistan's 
ability and intention to manufacture a nuclear bomb. Meanwhile, 
the Lockheed company is increasing pressure on President Clinton 
to allow the supply of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan. This proves 
that, after failing in its bid to repeal the Pressler Amendment, 
the Clinton administration has now thought of formulating the 
policy of a one-time waiver of the Pressler Amendment to allow 
the supply of F-16 planes to Pakistan and later making the 
amendment operative again. 
  I is apparent that with the help of this policy, a sheer 
humbuggery, the Clinton administration wants to make Pakistan 
stronger than India by getting rid of the Pressler Amendment, 
which will only result in the revival of the arms race in the 
Indian Subcontinent. The policy also tacitly encourages 
Pakistan to manufacture an atom bomb. India has thus far 
adopted the policy of not making any nuclear weapon. In spite 
of this, India has not yet signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT] because it thinks NPT is unfair to the nonnuclear 
states. However, if the United States chooses to patronize 
Islamabad's nuclear policy on the pretext of supplying F-16 
aircraft to Pakistan, then India will be forced to review its 
nuclear options, and this is the very meaning of Prime Minister 
Rao's alleged statement. If read in the context of our 
government's disinterestedness in Raphel's planned visit to 
India, the home minister's two warnings to the United States in 
parliament, and the successful role played by the Indian 
delegation at Geneva, one can derive the message that India's 
future attitude toward the U.S. can be firm and admonitory. 
Anything contrary will depend solely on the U.S. behavior.

<F P=106> [Commentary by defense analyst Udhay Bhaskar Reddy] </F>
  [Text] The report in the prestigious LOS ANGELES TIMES, 
better known as L.A. TIMES, that Pakistan has managed to build 
six to 12 Hiroshima-type bombs as part of its clandestine 
nuclear weapons program is significant for two reasons. In the 
first instance, it is not the number of bombs that Pakistan has 
stashed away in the basement that is germane. The United States 
was aware as early as in 1987 that Pakistan was embarked upon a 
determined clandestine nuclear weapons program and had accurate 
estimates about how much fissile grade material Islamabad had 
stockpiled. However, Washington preferred to pretend that it 
did not know as part of the Cold War charade. 
  What the L.A. TIMES story does is to draw attention to the 
many promises and pledges broken by Pakistan in its dealings 
with the United States over military aid to its clandestine 
nuclear weapons program. This is the first important inference, 
namely that in the past, whether it was in 1981 or 1985, the 
supply of lethal modern military gadgetry by the United States 
has not deflected Pakistan from its single-minded pursuit of a 
covert nuclear weapons program. That a respected U.S. daily is 
saying this may be reflective of the growing public 
disenchantment within the United States over proliferation 
perplexities. The second significant aspect is the inside the 
L.A. TIMES story provides into the deep divisions within the 
U.S. establishment over the Pressler Amendment and its 
interpretation. As the report points out, many senior-most 
officials in the Clinton Administration appear to be keen to 
condone Pakistan's nuclear quest under ardent advocates of 
waiving the amendment. However, there are more perceptive and 
informed voices, including that of Senator Larry Pressler, who 
are seized with the enormity of this seemingly casual one-time 
waiver. It does appear that the Clinton team is deluding itself 
that a one-time waiver of the Pressler Amendment would induce 
Pakistan to cap its nuclear weapons program and that the 
proliferation problem in the region will then be resolved. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. Whether Pakistan has 
one bomb in the basement or 12, this is a level at which the 
United States hopes it will capped. But, as the North Korean 
and Iraqi examples have shown, clandestine nuclear programs do 
not lend themselves to satisfactory external monitoring, and in 
any case this capping will not assuage India's anxieties over a 
bomb in the neighboring basement where even the elected prime 
minister is not allowed to visit the nuclear facility, let alone 
control it.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 19 (AFP) -- Calls for recognition 
of the Dalai Lama's government-in-exile and support for the 
Tibetan freedom struggle resounded at a global parliamentary 
conference on Tibet here Saturday. 
  Delegate after delegate voiced support for the cause of 
Tibetan independence from Chinese rule on the second day of the 
three-day convention, under way at a venue on the outskirts of 
the Indian capital. 
  Lord Ennais, a former British minister for home and overseas 
development and a member of the all-party parliamentary group 
for Tibet in Britain, urged the international community to 
extend recognition to the exile government. 
  He also called upon world governments to use their influence 
in the United Nations to help the Tibetan cause and end what he 
called the "last vestiges of colonialism." 
  It was the main theme of Saturday's proceedings at the 
conference, being attended by nearly 40 MPs from 23 countries 
and an equal number of Indian deputies. 
  Gonzalo Facio, a former foreign minister of Costa Rica and 
his country's ambassador to the United States, supported the 
call for recognition of the government-in-exile, based in the 
northern Indian town of Dharamsala. 
  "Such a recognition by governments will not immediately lead 
to the freedom of the Tibetan people but it will help them 
achieve the objective," said Facio. 
  "I am all in favour of it. I think governments will start 
doing it," he said. 
  The Dalai Lama, supreme spiritual leader of six million 
Tibetans, has lived in exile in India since fleeing his homeland 
in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule. 
  His government-in-exile is presently recognised by no 
country. His host India, which is home to some 100,000 of his 
followers, also treats Tibet as a part of China. 
  But the sentiments expressed at the parliamentary conference 
reflected the growing world support for recognition of the exile 
government, said Tashi Wangdi, a Tibetan leader. 
  Delegates also said complete independence was the only 
solution to the Tibetan issue. 
  "The root of all problems (in Tibet) is the Chinese colonial 
rule in Tibet," said Norwegian MP Harald Ellefsen. "Bringing an 
end to that colonial rule will be the only fair and just 
solution." 
  Latvian representative Jurif Sinka said: "I hope China will 
find the courage, humility and generosity .. and set the Tibetan 
people free." 
  Polish delegate Henryk Wujec urged the Tibetans to struggle 
like the Polish Solidarity group had done against the Communist 
regime in Warsaw. 
  Leif Bergdahl of Sweden suggested that the convention send a 
delegation to Tibet and compile a report on the situation in the 
Himalayan region, overrun by Chinese troops in 1949. 
  The conference is being held in the shadow of the Dalai 
Lama's warning to China earlier this month that he may be forced 
to bow to hardline elements within the Tibetan movement if China 
does not respond to his moderate approach. 
  Tibetan delegate Karma Chophell said the Tibetans wanted 
nothing less than total freedom. "We are not seeking any 
autonomy. this should be very clear to everyone," he said. 
  Chophell said the Tibetans had realised after 14 years of 
contacts between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities that 
Beijing was only biding time and was not interested in a 
solution. 
  "The final solution for all problems in Tibet is the 
complete 
independence of Tibet," he sad. 
  Deputies on Saturday also broke up into separate groups to 
discuss alleged human rights abuses in Tibet, environmental 
degradation and a perceived threat to Tibetan culture posed by a 
Chinese influx.

<F P=106> [New Year address by President Borhanoddin Rabbani; place </F>
and date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. [passage omitted] With full confidence and 
earnest belief we say that the people of Afghanistan, by the 
blessing of Almighty God, will overcome the difficulties and 
will succeed in defeating conspiracies and intrigues; and peace 
and security will be restored in every corner of the country as 
wished and desired by the people. With firmness and 
steadfastness we will repair the destruction left by the 
fighting and will realize the (?plan) for the country's economic 
revival and reconstruction. It should be mentioned that the 
Islamic State of Afghanistan is at a satisfactory level of 
having strength and power and is able [word indistinct] to stop 
[the enemy advances]. The Armed Forces of the Islamic state are 
enjoying high combative morale and powerful military 
preparedness. The past months' experience clearly demonstrates 
this fact: [words indistinct] of Kabul, clearing Konduz 
Province, districts of Anderab, Khenjan, and Doshi in Baghlan 
Province, as well as Ghowrmach District and some regions in 
Farab Province, of seditious elements and rebels, are vivid 
examples in this respect. Despite all the abilities and 
preparedness, the Islamic state follows the strategy of talks 
and understanding and rejects a military solution to the issues. 
  At this time, when the world has entered into a new stage of 
coexistence and understanding, a way must be sought for the 
fundamental solution of issues by talks in a peaceful manner. 
On the basis of these beliefs and thoughts the Islamic state 
emphasizes the principle of talks and understanding with the 
(?respective) Jehadi forces. Believing in the notion that 
people are the real heir [words indistinct] the people have a 
right to decide about their country and future leadership. 
During the period of the Islamic sovereignty the state has 
always paid respect to this principle and has always followed it 
in its actions. 
  Dear Compatriots, in order to get out of the present 
condition and for the sake of saving people from pain and 
sorrow, preventing further destruction of their homes by deadly 
rockets, and in respecting and following the principle of [words 
indistinct], the state pays respect to the will of people 
concerning the country's future leadership. We believe that a 
[word indistinct] decisionmaking assembly of the people 
delegates representing the will and views of the people and 
elected by a method that is acceptable to the relevant sides, is 
to be set up in the country as soon as possible. [passage 
indistinct] 
  Starting from the first day of 'Id al-Fitr the state has 
declared a unilateral 15-day-long cease-fire in Kabul city so 
that the peace delegations can work and accelerate their efforts 
on this path in a secure atmosphere away from threat. We have 
also invited the United Nations and the conference of the 
Islamic countries' foreign ministers to supervise the 
proceedings of convocation and activities of this assembly to 
make sure of its freedom of action. With pleasure I was 
informed that a UN delegation, led by esteemed Mahmud Mestiri, 
will soon travel to Afghanistan. [words indistinct] the state 
is ready for every cooperation with the UN delegation in this 
respect. 
  Dear compatriots, for marking Nawroz [New Year Day] in a 
proper way, and in order to provide better conditions for the 
peace delegations enabling them to accelerate further their 
fruitful work [words indistinct], I declare the extension of the 
unilateral cease-fire in Kabul city for another two weeks.

  [Text] According to reports from Afghanistan, there has 
been sporadic rocket firing on the capital, Kabul, from this 
morning. The Afghan Defense Ministry has recently warned that if 
the Dostam militia resorts to shelling Kabul, the government air 
force will take retaliatory action and the militia bases in and 
around Mazar-e Sharif will come under air strikes. However, 
there has been no report of any aerial action so far. Reports 
also say that there has been continuous exchange of artillery 
and rocket fire between rival factions in the northern province 
of Baghlan.

  [Text] Kuwait, 20 Mar--In an interview published here 
today, Defense Minister Shaykh 'Ali Sabah al-Salim al-Sabah 
ruled out that the ministry would review or withdraw from 
purchasing a number of U.S. Patriot missiles. 
  The defense minister's statement to the AL-ANBA' newspaper 
followed reports on the dependence of the U.S. Army on new 
missiles, cancelling its dependence on the Patriot in air 
defense missions. The Kuwaiti defense minister clarified to the 
newspaper that the new type of missiles were still being tested 
for their effectiveness. He added that the upgraded Patriot 
missile that was being used by the U.S. Army would be the same 
type used by Kuwaiti forces. 
  Shaykh 'Ali al-Sabah justified the delay in purchasing these 
missiles and other types of armament and military equipment for 
the forces by citing a delay in the approval of the military 
budget. He also added that a reduction in the number of American 
technicians working in the various army units came after they 
had concluded their duties. He said they had completed their 
business and that their contracts had ended in a normal manner.

  [Excerpt] Kuwait, 21 March -- In a press statement 
published here today, Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs 
'Abd-al-'Aziz al- Dakhil has denied reports of the existence of 
an Iraqi offer to exchange Kuwaiti prisoners still in the Iraqi 
regime's prisons for 11 Iraqis being tried in Kuwait charged 
with attempting to assassinate former American President George 
Bush. The newspaper AL-ANBA quoted the minister of state for 
cabinet affairs as saying that the State of Kuwait "has not and 
will not agree to this type of maneuvering and trickery, which 
is undertaken by the Baghdad regime from time to time to create 
a stir and give the international community the impression that 
it is seeking to find stability in the region." He pointed out 
that "the aim behind this attempt is to lift the economic 
sanctions that have been imposed on Iraq for some time now."

  [Excerpts] Riyadh, March 18, SPA -- Saudi papers on Friday 
tackled a number of regional and international topics. 
  Commenting on the development of the peace process in the 
Middle East following the vicious massacre of Hebron last month, 
the Jeddah-based AL-MADINAH cited statements made recently by 
the Israeli Prime Minister Rabin and a high-ranking Israeli 
general and said the statements made it clear that Israel does 
not sincerely interest in peace and talking about peace is just 
for local consumption and for wasting time. [passage omitted] 
  For its part, 'UKAZ, also published in Jeddah, expressed 
surprise on the American latest positions on the peace process 
in the Middle East and said the American stand would not remove 
obstacles that hinder realisation of a peaceful settlement. 
  The paper criticized the U.S. attempts to prevent the 
Security Council from making a resolution to denounce the 
massacre of Hebron. It also deplored a statement attributed to 
President Clinton recently on the status of al-Quds [Jerusalem] 
as an insult for the Arab and Moslim people. 
  The paper cited the importance of an international 
protection 
for the residents of the occupied lands before making any 
breakthrough in peace talks. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Riyadh, 18 Mar (SPA) -- A responsible source at the 
Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources said in a statement 
to SPA today that what was published yesterday, 17 March, by the 
TEHRAN TIMES on Saudi Arabia's oil production and policy was 
merely unfounded newspaper fabrication which was not based on 
reality. 
  He added that "the international oil industry and 
international oil organizations, including OPEC, consider the 
TEHRAN TIMES to be an unreliable source of information and oil 
analyses. That is, it is a newspaper that lacks credibility and 
no trust can be placed in what it says about the oil situation 
in the Arab Gulf region or outside it." 
  He said: "All specialized oil publications, organizations, 
and oil information centers certify that the Kingdom adheres to 
its allotted quota and to all the agreements it signs. In 
contrast, Iran, according to most sources, adheres to its quota 
only when it is incapable of production." The source added: 
"The untrustworthy Iranian oil policy has become a source of 
annoyance inside OPEC and helped prices to fall over the past 
four months." 
  The source concluded his statement by saying: "The attempt 
by the TEHRAN TIMES to avoid talking about the deteriorating 
economic conditions inside Iran as a result of the poor 
financial and oil policies of the Iranian Government and to 
blame others for this is a desperate effort; neither the outside 
world nor the Iranian people themselves will believe it."

<F P=106> [Statement by "responsible source" at the General People's </F>
Congress General Committee to SABA'; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] We were all surprised by the statement by brother 
'Ali Salim al-Bid, Presidential Council vice chairman, to the 
United Arab Emirates' English-language newspaper, THE GULF NEWS, 
on 16 March. These statements were reported by news agencies and 
some world radios. Al-Bid said in that interview that if a 
plebiscite is held in the southern and eastern provinces, the 
majority will prefer returning to conditions that existed before 
22 May 1990. This is secession. 
  We regret this statement by the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] 
secretary general. It casts doubt on the patriotism of citizens 
in the southern and eastern provinces and on their adherence to 
unity. We express our absolute rejection of this accusation, 
which we consider to be directed against all the Yemeni people. 
We consider this statement an accusation of the YSP itself 
because we firmly believe most YSP members adhere to, and will 
continue to adhere to, unity and democracy. The forces of 
defection and secession that have influence inside the YSP draw 
strength from foreign forces that target unity and democracy in 
Yemen. We believe this statement is not only a serious 
accusation directed against the the Yemeni people, particularly 
the majority of YSP members, but also a statement with very 
serious dimensions. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Libyan Movement for Change and </F>
Reform Announces Its Program, Prepares for Constituent 
Conference"] 
  [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- Dissidents of the National Front 
for the Salvation of Libya announced yesterday the birth of a 
new Libyan opposition organization called the Libyan Movement 
for Change and Reform. 
  The organization's constituent committee named Abrik [as 
transliterated] al-Suwaysi as its official spokesman. In the 
founding statement it issued in Geneva yesterday, the committee 
explained its overall intellectual and political view of Libya's 
situation and future. It stressed the need to form a democratic 
system based on free elections, peaceful political practice, and 
rejection of "any forms of material or organizational linkage 
with foreign states or political forces and organizations which 
could blemish national affiliation with the suspicion of loyalty 
to non-national interests and schemes." 
  The statement said that preliminary consultations among "a 
large number of Libyan strugglers" have resulted in the 
formation of a constituent committee, which has decided the 
following: 
  "First, to work to build a political force to be joined by 
Libyans who reject tyranny and dictatorship and those seeking to 
restore legitimacy in their country, contribute to correcting 
its deteriorating conditions, and lay foundations suitable for 
rebuilding the country with the will of its people and their 
independent decisionmaking, so that it will be a homeland for 
pride and dignity and a land for freedom, democracy, stability, 
development, and progress in the context of the belief in the 
following basic principles and foundations: 
  "-- The importance of organized political action as a 
foundation for a civilized civil society. 
  "-- Constitutional legitimacy implemented through in a 
people's referendum by a free secret ballot as the only basis 
for government, and considering any authority that is not based 
on the people's will an illegitimate authority that should be 
rejected. 
  "-- Democracy as a foundation for the system of government 
and a method for the peaceful political practice of political 
action, and the incrimination and combating of the methods of 
terror and material and moral violence. 
  "-- Islam as the basic source of legislation and a 
cultural authority on which to rely as a foundation, criteria, 
and program for the comprehensive cultural transformation 
process in the various areas of life. 
  "-- The fundamental position held by freedom of opinion 
and expression among the various basic human freedoms, on the 
grounds that it is a human value and a principal pillar of a 
civilized civil society. 
  "-- The fundamental value of work and free initiative as 
basic pillars of a free and developed economy that is good at 
utilizing national resources and financial and material 
capabilities so as to achieve self-sufficiency, stability, and 
prosperity. 
  "-- Libyan national identity as a basic factor in the 
various choices relating to Libyan society's transformation from 
a state of tyranny, chaos, and cultural backwardness to a state 
of legitimacy, rule of constitutional institutions, and 
comprehensive cultural advancement. In addition, current local 
human, cultural, and economic factors are considered basic 
elements for the authenticity of these choices as distinct from 
other formulas and methods. 
  "-- Affirmation of a civilized concept of the duties of the 
security forces, including police and intelligence, namely to 
protect citizens' security, property, privacy, freedom, and 
rights, and to protect the security and stability of civilian 
life in society as a whole, not the ruling executive authority 
and its continuation in power. 
  "-- Affirmation of the national, pan-Arab, and 
humanitarian role of the national defense forces, namely to 
protect constitutional legitimacy, safeguard the national 
territory's independence and unity, and contribute positively to 
pan-Arab and humanitarian efforts to establish peace and 
guarantee the people's right to self-determination. 
  "-- National unity represented in territorial integrity 
and the Libyan people's unity, and commitment to bolstering, 
consolidating, protecting, and defending it against racial, 
frontal, and tribal disputes and to fighting any inclinations or 
attempts to strike at it or impair it. 
  "-- National affiliation represented in the sincere 
affiliation of Libyans -- individuals and political forces -- to 
their homeland and people; affirmation of the independence of 
the national will; and rejection of any forms of material or 
organizational linkage with foreign states or political forces 
and organizations which could blemish national affiliation with 
the suspicion of loyalty to non-national interests and schemes. 
  "-- Arab affiliation, on the grounds that Libya is part of 
the Arab nation and bound to it culturally and by destiny. 
  "-- Islamic affiliation, on the grounds that Libya is part 
of the Islamic world, proceeding from the faith and Islamic 
values. It interacts with it and is aware of the nation's 
reality and current issues. 
  "-- Affiliation to the international community by virtue 
of the scale and nature of international interactions and the 
belief in Libya's role founded on the establishment of 
international relations based on the principles of peace, 
cooperation, and noninterference in the internal affairs of the 
other peoples and states. 
  "Second, it has been initially agreed to call this new 
struggle formula the Libyan Movement for Change and Reform and 
to choose brother struggler Abrik al-Suwaysi as official 
spokesman for the constituent committee. 
  "Third, to continue contacts, consultations, and endeavors 
in 
order to complete the elements and requirements needed for the 
convening of the constituent conference, which will be devoted 
to achieving the following steps: 
  "-- To endorse the basic principles and general features 
of the struggle and political program; 
  "-- To endorse the name and slogans; 
  "-- To elect the various organizational institutions; 
  "In announcing this practical preliminary step, the 
Constituent Committee of the Libyan Movement for Change and 
Reform is eager to stress the following: 
  "-- Its members do not claim anything other than the honor 
of taking the initiative to shoulder part of the responsibility 
to achieve this historic national endeavor. 
  "-- Their mission will end with the convening of the 
constituent assembly, which alone will be entitled to take the 
various organizational, political, and practical decisions, 
including selecting and electing the institutions and 
leaderships in a democratic manner based on free choice and the 
adoption of the majority's opinion. 
  "-- The door is open to all Libyan strugglers who agree in 
principle with the intellectual and political features declared 
in this statement in order to contribute to enriching and 
bolstering this historic national endeavor and join the ranks of 
those who took the initiative, in order to make it a success." 
  Meanwhile, Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Ghalbun, leader of the Libyan 
Constitutional Union, has welcomed the establishment of the new 
organization, describing it as "a tributary of national action 
and a comrade on the road of sacrifice for the sake of ridding 
our homeland of its current predicament." He wished it and its 
founders "success."

  [Text] Tripoli, 19 Mar, JANA -- Various international 
information organs have reported American President Clinton's 
statements that the Arab city of Jerusalem was the united and 
eternal capital of the Zionist entity. 
  JANA's international affairs editor has commented on those 
reports saying: Such statements have revealed that the American 
President was under pressures from the Jewish lobby in America. 
It was the Jews who initiated the Whitewater scandal and they 
implicated Clinton in it, and because of its repercussions, 
which have increased his fears for his political future as 
president, the American President is now trying to side fully 
with them. However, the victims of such a support will be, 
without any doubts, the Arabs, as usual. 
  The American President's announcement that he supported the 
idea of Jerusalem as the united and eternal capital of the 
Zionist entity was like a new Belfort [name as received] 
Declaration, through which he who did not own gave to whom who 
did not deserve. If the American President wanted to give 
something to the Jews why doesn't he give them his wife, 
Washington, or New York for example; Jerusalem is an Arab city 
and he has nothing to with it. 
  JANA's international affairs editor wondered, however: Where 
the Arabs were, at time they can see that their capitals were 
being sold to or just given away in order to win the Jews' 
amity? Where are those who have been singing pan-Arabism, Islam 
praises, and lifting the banner of martyrdom at a time when they 
can see Christians showing contempt to their holy places and 
legitimizing their usurpation by the Jews?. 
  The editor added: The time to sort out who is who has 
arrived 
because matters have become clear; any Arab, who stands with 
America, is an infidel. Arabs ought to carry out Jihad; they 
have every right to martyrdom for the sake of their land and 
their rights.

  [Text] New York, Al Rabia [March] 19, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS 
AGENCY -- After more than three weeks since the massacre was 
committed by the Israeli terrorists at al-Hram al-Ibrahimi, the 
so called Security Council adopted a vaguely worded condemnation 
of the massacre without any reference to its perpetrators. 
Despite the vagueness of the resolution, the USA abstained from 
voting for the resolution. Moreover the American representative 
declared that her government opposed any reference to the Arab 
lands occupied by Israel as occupied lands including the city of 
Jerusalem. 
  The Security Council resorted, on the behest of the USA, to 
a 
strange way in voting on the resolution. Accordingly, voting 
was taken on each paragraph separately. The resolution did not 
refer to any responsibility of the Israelis in this crime nor to 
any condemnation of Israel's state terrorism. 
  The condemnation was worded, in each paragraph, in a manner 
that did not refer directly to those responsible for the 
massacre or charging anyone for this act. 
  JANA's editor for international affairs described what took 
place in the so called Security Council as a new absurdity 
showing once again that the Security Council is a lie. This 
showed clearly that the Security Council is the Western 
Christian countries, if not America, which dominate it and that 
the alliance between Christians and Jews against Muslims lies 
behind this American stance towards the massacre of al-Haram 
al-Ibrahimi. It has become clear to the whole world that the 
resolutions passed in the name of the Security Council 
especially in relation to Arab matters are wholly 
Western-American resolutions. The resolution was adopted without 
any effective condemnation of Israel for terrorism for America 
did not want this condemnation or sanctions imposed on Israel 
whereas when it comes to issues which may serve her political 
objectives, America pass, on mere suspicion, resolutions of 
condemnation for terrorism imposing sanctions and embargo and 
applying Chapter Seven of the U.N Charter against whomever she 
wishes. This stance exposes America and deprives her even of 
the fig leaf revealing her before the whole world as a terrorist 
state sponsoring and supporting official terrorism and 
protecting its perpetrators. 
  JANA's editor for international affairs concluded his 
commentary by stressing that "the act of the Security Council 
today shows clearly what the leader of the revolution meant in 
statement immediately in the wake of the massacre of al-Haram 
al-Ibrahimi when he declared `although the massacre represents 
the most hideous act of terrorism ever seen in the world.' It 
is clear and express act of terrorism but we challenge the West 
to announce this fact and admit that the act of the Israelis is 
a premeditated official terrorism. It is part of a long chain 
of Israeli terrorist acts and condemn the Israelis for 
terrorism."

had been involved in an unsuccessful bid to overthrow the regime 
and forced them to appear on television to publicly confess that 
they had been spying for the United States. 
  A spokesman for the Libyan National Salvation Front [words 
indistinct] that Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi continued 
to deny there had been a rebellion even though Arab diplomatic 
sources in Libya assert that a rebellion really did occur. 
  At the time of the rebellion, press sources said it was 
organized by Islamic hardliners among the Army officers. These 
sources said the rebellion started on 11 October 1993.

  [Text] Alexandria, 18 Mar (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr 
Musa has affirmed that in the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations 
Egypt places its direct and indirect contacts with the various 
parties at the disposal and in the service of the Arab party. 
  In an interview on the program "Guest and Issue" transmitted 
by Arab Radio and Television (ART) from Rome and monitored here 
today, the foreign minister noted that Egypt is a responsible 
Arab state. It is the biggest Arab state and it was the one that 
launched the first initiative for Arab-Israeli peace. 
  Musa said that the Arab-Israeli conflict has a long and 
complex history, resulting in numerous concepts and stances. He 
added that overcoming these contradictory concepts demands three 
elements: The first is time, the second is determination and 
persistence, and the third is a high level of negotiating skills. 
  The foreign minister pointed out that these three elements 
have made it possible for the Palestinians and Israelis to reach 
agreement on the Declaration of Principles. But the actual 
implementation of these principles has been facing many 
difficulties and obstacles. 
  Musa said the Palestinian issue is in the process of being 
solved; the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles marks 
the beginning of this solution. This also means that there are 
Palestinian rights that must be accepted and restored, and that 
the situation cannot continue as it has under any circumstance. 
The foreign minister affirmed that this agreement was a first 
step and not the final one, as the Israelis think. He said: 
Neither the Palestinians nor Egypt would accept this. This 
step does not give us everything but some of what we want. 
  He added that there are essential differences between the 
Israelis and the Palestinians about the details. Both parties 
maintain positions of principle on every point. He said: We 
need a step that will touch the essence of the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and the word withdrawal is 
considered extremely important in this regard. 
  Asked about the issue of regional security, which countries 
are covered by this security concept, and the relationship 
between this and the Arab interests, Musa said: Regional 
security is not open to everyone. Inclusion in it must be the 
subject of a political decision. Anyone who wants to be 
included must make many concessions to convince the others of 
its desire for peace. He added that this applies to states 
outside the Arab geographical sphere. It also applies to a 
state such as Israel. 
  Regarding weapons of mass destruction in Israel, the foreign 
minister said: A resolution of this issue is a precondition for 
the establishment of comprehensive peace in the Middle East. 
  Asked about relations with Iran, the foreign minister said 
there is a very large scope for the establishment of very good 
relations between Iran and the Arab states. It is possible to 
have Arab-Iranian cooperation and ties provided Iran proves its 
true desire for the establishment of such relations and refrains 
from anything that could negatively affect such relations. He 
noted that one cannot talk about good relations while part of an 
Arab state's territory, such as the United Arab Emirates, is 
under occupation. 
  Asked about the Middle Eastern market and reports about 
Israeli and U.S. pressures for the establishment of such a 
market, Musa said: We cannot prevent any Israeli official from 
talking about this issue or from visualizing what he wants. But 
this does not mean that there are Israeli pressures. 
  Musa affirmed that Israel cannot dominate the economies of 
the neighboring Arab states, as it is not an oil-producing 
country and, therefore, cannot control it and its prices.

  [Text] Cairo, 21 Mar (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has 
announced that Dennis Ross, the U.S. envoy and coordinator on 
the Middle East peace talks, will arrive in Cairo tomorrow, 
Tuesday, to hold talks and consultations on the peace process. 
This comes as part of his tour of the region to discuss current 
contacts and the resumption of negotiations. 
  Musa said in statements today that after the negotiations 
resume, the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles should 
be implemented quickly and autonomy should begin in Gaza and 
Jericho. He added that there is no reason for the continuous 
stalling and postponement of the Israeli withdrawal and 
implementation of the agenda agreed on in the Declaration of 
Principles. We are waiting for this agenda to be finalized, he 
said, as long as all the parties agree to negotiate. 
  As for postponing negotiations on the settlements until the 
final stages of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, Musa said 
in his statements that the final stage of the negotiations must 
not be delayed beyond the end of the second year after 
implementing the current agreement on Gaza and Jericho. 
  The foreign minister clarified that if the Israeli 
withdrawal 
and Palestinian repatriation were to begin a month from now, in 
April, for example, arrangements should begin then. 
  'Amr Musa affirmed that the important issue is to 
immediately 
stop building new settlements in the occupied Arab territories. 
No new settlements should be built. 
  'Amr Musa affirmed that the presence of settlements in the 
occupied Arab territories causes security violations. Besides, 
the territories on which these settlements are built do not 
belong to them. They have absolutely no right to build. Most 
settlers are criminals, which is not acceptable. We understand 
that there can be coexistence but we do not understand why a 
group of crazy criminals or crazy people should be in control, 
such as Gush Emunim, Kahana Hay, and their ilk, because this is 
terrorism in its purest form; it is the dangerous and blind kind 
of terrorism based on fanaticism that is recognized by no law. 
This is a very important issue. 
  The foreign minister again demanded that the Palestinians be 
provided with security. He said this is the lesson we have 
learned from the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Musa also asked 
the Israeli occupation forces to provide the Palestinian people 
under occupation with protection. This is stipulated by 
international resolutions. 
  On the Addis Ababa meeting to convene on 23 March, Musa said 
that one of the most important topics proposed to the meeting is 
the mechanism for resolving conflicts in Africa. It will be 
chaired by Egypt, the current chairman of the OAU. 
  He said the mechanism will address the issue of the OAU's 
intervention in current conflicts and in the prevention of 
disputes that might erupt. 
  He added that they will discuss the Somalia issue and 
developments in this connection following the dialogue that took 
place in Egypt among the 13 Somali factions. Burundi, the 
conflict between Cameroon and Nigeria, and the situation in 
Rwanda will also be addressed.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Is It the Truth or an Israeli Trap?"] </F>
  [Text] I have no idea whether this morning's newspaper 
reports attributed to Israeli radio are the truth or a 
premeditated Zionist trap to drive more wedges into existing 
relations between the United States and the Arab and Islamic 
countries. These newspapers published a statement by President 
Clinton declaring that the unified Jerusalem is the capital of 
Israel. 
  If this statement is true, then it means there has been a 
radical change in the U.S. stand on the Jerusalem issue and it 
also represents a real catastrophe for all the Arab and Islamic 
countries and the PLO too. 
  We know that the official U.S. stand on the Jerusalem issue 
regards East Jerusalem (the Arab part) as an occupied territory 
to which all the UN resolutions, including Resolution 242, are 
applicable in the same way they are applicable to all the other 
occupied territories. But in view of the sensitivity of the 
status of Jerusalem, both its Arab and Jewish sectors, for the 
followers of the three major religions -- Muslims, Christians, 
and Jews -- and its special sensitivity for Israel and in view 
of Israel's topographical and demographic changes to Jerusalem, 
the U.S. stand has been that the future of Jerusalem should be 
decided during the final stages of the negotiations. And this 
does not mean that they deny the fact that East Jerusalem is 
occupied territory. In view of this stand, the United States 
has so far refused to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to 
Jerusalem. 
  Hence, this provocative statement attributed to President 
Clinton worries the Arabs and Muslims in general and the 
Palestinians in particular. In our view, if this statement is 
true then it is hundreds of times more serious than the 
al-Ibrahmi Mosque massacre because it slaughters our Jerusalem 
itself and presents it as an offering to Israel. 
  But it is our duty to wait before being overcome by emotions 
and first ask the U.S. Administration for a clarification of 
this grave stand, because I discern in it the involvement of 
Zionism, which is well versed in the art of driving wedges and 
laying traps. 
  It is clear from the report published by AL-AHRAM that 
Clinton did not say this directly to the conference of the 
American-Israeli Political Action Committee [AIPAC], the largest 
of the Jewish-American organizations, but to Steven Grossman, 
the AIPAC chairman, who cited the U.S. President at the 
conference. Radio Israel said that the U.S. President told the 
AIPAC leaders that the United States regards the unified 
Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The radio added that 
Clinton said this in reply to a question from an AIPAC member on 
the possibility that the Security Council will pass a resolution 
on the Hebron massacre that will include a reference to 
Jerusalem as part of the occupied territories. The radio added 
that Clinton is keen not to let Jerusalem be mentioned in the 
Council's resolution and designated as part of the occupied 
territories. 
  The fact of the matter, as reported by the news agencies and 
all other media, is that Clinton's objection to any mention of 
Jerusalem does not stem from his ideas about it being occupied 
territory but from his desire not to raise it in negotiations 
until the final stage of the peace process. There is a big 
difference between these two concerns. The new stand would mean 
that the United States has unilaterally decided the fate of all 
Jerusalem in favor of Israel. The old stand means that the fate 
of Jerusalem remains subject to negotiations; and this in fact 
is the U.S. stand known to everyone. 
  It is spurious to note here, as the AIPAC chairman did, that 
Clinton never mentioned Jerusalem during his election campaign, 
because the circumstances of the elections are one thing and the 
official U.S. stand is something else. Why couldn't we say, for 
example, that Clinton's silence over deciding the fate of 
Jerusalem in favor of Israel during the elections campaign -- 
that is, when he most needed the Jewish votes and the Zionist 
lobby's support -- is proof that Grossman's statements on Radio 
Israel are a mere media fabrication or an intentional propaganda 
ploy meant to embarrass the Arabs and divert any U.S. attempt to 
force more flexible negotiating stances on Israel? 
  I therefore advise that we wait and be cautious and also 
that 
we seek clarification of the issue from those who have authority 
to define such stands before we take any action on this very 
grave affair.

<F P=106> [From the "AL-WAFD's View" column: "Who Dares to Object?"] </F>
  [Text] We have so far not heard a single Arab capital or 
leader criticizing the irresponsible remarks of U.S. President 
Bill Clinton, remarks that Jerusalem is the eternal united 
capital of Israel. 
  We have not heard the Jerusalem Committee, which is made up 
of Arab kings and presidents, breaking its silence to submit an 
oral or written protest telling that person sitting in the White 
House that Jerusalem was Arab before he was born and that it 
will be Arab eternally. 
  The Arab League, which speaks on behalf of the Arabs, has 
not 
called an emergency meeting to discuss this serious shift, which 
threatens Arab rights to Jerusalem. 
  Not a single foreign ministry throughout the Arab world has 
issued a statement, not even a one-page statement, saying that 
the Arabs reject the provocative U.S. statements and demanding 
an explanation, if not an apology. 
  Do these remarks mean that the United States has 
unilaterally 
decided to change the bases on which the Madrid peace process 
was founded? 
  What kind of talks are these if everything is being 
determined away from the negotiating table and without involving 
the negotiators? Can America put on priestly robes and claim to 
be honest and neutral after this? 
  With the new Balfour Declaration he just made, Clinton has 
stooped to the level of blatant bias toward Israel at the 
expense of Arab rights. We do not dismiss the possibility that 
he might come out on us one ill-omened morning to announce the 
movement of the American Embassy to Jerusalem. 
  O Arabs, wake up and stand up as one man so that we do not 
lose Jerusalem forever.

  [Text] Cairo, 18 Mar (MENA)--Palestine National Council 
[PNC] Secretary Muhammad Subayh has stressed that U.S. President 
Bill Clinton's statement that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel 
is an Israeli attempt to blackmail the U.S. Administration at a 
time when it is coming under enormous domestic criticism. In a 
statement on the sidelines of the Second Conference for 
Solidarity and Cooperation in the Mediterranean in the 1990's, 
scheduled to open in Cairo Saturday, he said that this 
statement, which was broadcast over Israeli Radio, if it was 
truly made, is considered a violation of the Security Council 
resolution on Jerusalem and former U.S. administrations' 
stances, which considered Jerusalem as occupied territory. He 
noted that such a statement will lead to confusion and harm the 
peace process, especially at this time when we are talking of a 
fair and comprehensive peace based on international legitimacy's 
resolutions, primarily Resolution 242, and of former U.S. 
President Bush's call for the exchange of land for peace. He 
pointed out that the Arab and Palestinian stand affirms that 
what applies to the occupied territories applies to Jerusalem. 
  Tawfiq Zayyad, member of the Democratic Front for Peace and 
Equality and Nazareth mayor, who is participating in the 
conference, said that East Jerusalem will remain the eternal 
capital of a Palestinian state and that any other thinking is a 
figment of one's imagination. He said that the Arab population 
of Nazareth, which has been part of the occupied territories 
since 1948, launched a mammoth uprising and general strike in 
the wake of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre that occurred in 
Ramadan. He noted that these people clashed with Israeli 
police, which arrested 60 to 70 people, including four of his 
own sons. 
  It should be recalled that a Palestinian delegation is 
participating in the Second Conference for Solidarity and 
Cooperation in the Mediterranean in the 1990's, scheduled to 
begin in Cairo tomorrow.

  [Text] Harare, 18 Mar (MENA)--An official Egyptian source 
stated that Egypt continues its contacts with the United States 
on the adoption of a Security Council resolution condemning "the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre" on 15 Ramadan, with the aim of 
resuming the peace negotiations between the Israelis and 
Palestinians, and on the other tracks. In a statement to MENA 
in Harare today, the source said the issuance of such a 
resolution by the Security Council would reassure the PLO about 
the protection and security of the Palestinian people in the 
occupied Arab territories. He noted that a U.S. veto of such a 
resolution would be an obstacle to the peace process.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Zayn al-Ja'fari: "Slogans Will Not Help </F>
Resolve the Arab-Israeli Conflict"] 
  [Text] One of the issues over which no one has any doubt, 
even for one moment, is that every family in the Arab and 
Islamic worlds was shocked at the bestial and inhuman massacre 
of the Palestinian Muslims while they were performing their dawn 
prayers at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. Undoubtedly, this 
massacre also saddened us greatly. It made some voices in the 
Arab world ask Egypt in particular to take violent measures in 
response to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. This request is 
based on Egypt's status and importance in the Arab and Islamic 
worlds. Some went as far as asking that the negotiations 
between the Palestinians and Israelis be halted. 
  However, we wish to calmly clarify to those who made these 
demands that by doing so, we would be serving the interests of 
Israel itself. It would be better for them to ask the Arabs and 
Muslims to exert greater efforts to rally the support of 
international public opinion for the Arab cause and put pressure 
on Israel to provide full protection for the defenseless 
Palestinian people and the sacred Muslim and Christian shrines 
in Palestine equally, especially in light of the Security 
Council's hesitation to pass a resolution condemning this 
massacre and confirming the need to protect the Palestinians. 
These voices would fare better if they realize that exploiting 
this massacre to thwart the peace process only serves to stir up 
emotions, incite the masses, and repeat those slogans that 
through experience have proven to lead to nothing except further 
losses for the Arab side in its struggle with Israel. 
  We wish to confirm that Egypt and its political leadership 
are fully convinced of the usefulness and inevitability of peace 
and that ever since the peace process started, Israel has been 
trying to escape from the peace siege. Those who have been 
following the Egyptian stance since the state of Israel was 
created realize that the Egyptian stance is firm and that Egypt 
moves in all directions to retrieve Arab rights. Egypt has 
waged many long wars for this purpose, the last of which was the 
1973 war. Egypt's efforts did not stop for one instant. For 
this purpose, Egypt participates in the other Arab efforts that 
move in the same direction, particularly since recent 
international developments have affirmed without a shadow of a 
doubt that usurped Arab rights cannot be retrieved except with 
solidarity and coordination among Arab capitals. Such 
solidarity and coordination has become an urgent need now, 
especially since Israel is trying to break free from the peace 
siege. Proof of this is the Israeli Government's stance on the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Although some Israeli officials 
condemned this massacre, the essence of Israeli policy toward 
the settlers and settlements has not changed. Israel depends on 
two things to continue this policy. The first is that the 
international community is not yet ready to take decisive 
measures against Israel; the Security Council's stand is the 
prime example of this. The second is that the American stand 
encourages Israel to continue ignoring Arab rights; U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's statement provided the necessary 
evidence of this point. He declared his recognition of 
Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel at a time when the 
blood of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque martyrs had not yet dried. 
  Egypt has proceeded to reject all measures taken by Israel 
on 
Jerusalem after June 1967. Egypt considers these measures null 
and void. Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa's statement that Jerusalem 
is part of the occupied territories was a response to the U.S. 
President's statement. He described President Clinton's 
statement as a political and tactical statement. 
  In light of all this, the importance of proceeding with the 
peace process becomes clear. Inciting the people and provoking 
their feelings will not help resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Rahim 'Ali] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A team from the Islamic Group 
attacked a tourist boat on the morning of 'Id al-Fitr [13 March] 
near the Island of Mijris, Markaz Sidfa, directly opposite 
al-Badari Island. The same boat came under another attack half 
an hour later near Asyut. The boat's guards exchanged fire with 
the terrorists, who fled in the direction of al-Badari Island. 
  On the same day, the Islamic Group issued a statement 
justifying its operations by saying that they were in 
retaliation for the massacres of Bosnia's Muslims. 
  The group distributed the statement in Asyut and al-Minya 
immediately after the 'Id al-Fitr prayers. It threatened to 
continue the jihad despite the military trials and arrests. 
  Appealing to Muslim religious scholars, the group said in 
its 
statement: To our ulemas who are feigning sorrow over national 
unity with the Orthodox Christians in Egypt and traveling across 
the country to attack the Muslim youths and excuse the regime's 
mistakes, we say that the international news agencies have 
feigned sorrow over the 200,000 Muslims butchered by Orthodox 
Serbs, the more than 50,000 Muslim women and girls publicly 
raped, and the thousands of children buried alive, slaughtered, 
or placed in cement mixers and fodder mills. What have you done? 
  The statement also appealed to police officers to join the 
Islamic Group. 
  The statement did not refer once to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
in 
Hebron despite its lengthy talk on Bosnia and the mujahidin in 
Algeria, Tunisia, Kashmir, Libya, Burma, Morocco, Iraq, and 
Syria. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Islamic Group in Egypt has claimed 
responsibility for detonating a bomb in front of a Cairo bank 
yesterday, which wounded one person and caused severe property 
damage to the building. The Islamic Group has launched more 
than nine bomb attacks against Egyptian and foreign banks. 
  In a statement issued today, it warned people who frequent 
banks of similar attacks. The statement added that yesterday's 
explosion in front of a building housing the Misr-America 
International Bank had come in revenge for the execution of two 
[Army] officers on Thursday on charges of attempting to 
assassinate Egyptian President Husni Mubarak during a visit to 
the Sidi Barrani base at the Egyptian-Libyan border in November.

  [Text] Cairo, March 18 (AFP)--The Egyptian authorities 
banned sales of the Friday edition of the London-based 
Arabic-language daily AL-HAYAT because it reported the execution 
of the two fundamentalist soldiers accused of plotting to kill 
Mubarak, reliable sources said. 
  The Egyptian media did not mention the executions or the 
trial of the two Islamic militants. 
  AL-HAYAT is edited in London and distributed in Cairo and 
other Arab capitals. 
  Last year the authorities criticised the newspaper several 
times, notably in connection with its publication of an 
interview with Shaykh Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, whom the Islamic 
militants regard as their spiritual leader.

  [Text] Cairo, March 18 (AFP) -- Four journalists at a 
magazine sympathetic to Moslem fundamentalists were detained for 
criticizing the government and urging Egyptians to protests the 
Hebron massacre, one of the writers said Friday. 
  The Al-Sha'b journalists on Thursday had to answer 
accusations they "incited hatred against the government and 
published articles threatening social peace and national unity," 
journalist 'Adil Husayn told AFP. 
  The four were also accused of urging protests over the 
February 25 massacre of 30 Arab worshippers at a mosque in the 
occupied West Bank town of Hebron, said Husayn, who is also 
secretary general of the opposition Labor Party, an ally of the 
Moslem Brotherhood. 
  The prosecutor of Egypt's High State Security Court will 
decide in the next few weeks whether to put them on trial after 
summoning the four on Thursday, he said. 
  The three others are Labor Party Deputy Chairman Hilmi 
Murad, 
Managing Editor Majdi Husayn and journalist Mustafa Bakri. 
  Husayn said it was "legal to criticize multiparty 
governments 
as Egypt says it is, but the detention of the journalists 
reveals totalitarian tendencies contrary to the constitution."

  [Text] For the third consecutive day, the UN Security 
Council members failed to agree on the new formula of the 
president's statement the council is expected to issue on the 
bimontly review of the embargo against Iraq. The UN Security 
Council is scheduled to hold another session at 1900 today, 
Baghdad time. Sources that participated in the council's 
deliberations yesterday told journalists that a clear rift in 
the positions of UN Security Council members has resulted in two 
groups. The first adopts the formula of previous council 
statements that automatically renew the embargo every two 
months. This group comprises the United States, the United 
Kingdom, and Argentina. The second group adopts a new formula 
for the president's statement reflecting the progress achieved 
in the implementation of resolution 687 and Iraq's acceptance of 
resolution 715. This group is led by France, China, and Russia, 
and is supported by other member countries. 
  It has been noticed that this time the Russian envoy has 
spoken forcefully in favor of the new formula, in accordance 
with instructions the Russian ambassador received from Moscow. 
Other sources said the Spanish and Czech ambassadors have asked 
to consult their governments before defining their position on 
the new statement. 
  Another report from New York says diplomats from various 
delegations today emphasized that UN Security Council members 
are divided about the position to take toward Iraq because both 
the United States and the United Kingdom strongly oppose any 
recognition that Iraq has made some progress in implementing the 
UN Security Council resolutions. 
  It has been decided to hold new consultations in this 
respect 
this evening, 18 March. However, Vorontsov, the Russian 
ambassador to the United Nations, ruled out the possibility of 
reaching an agreement on any formula. Vorontsov said the UN 
Security Council members are divided on this topic for the first 
time in four and one-half years. 
  Other diplomats in the United Nations said France, China, 
Russia, and Brazil and other countries want the UN Security 
Council to recognize that Iraq has made some progress in 
implementing the council's resolutions. However, the United 
States and the United Kingdom reject this idea. They voiced 
their displeasure with the recent Iraqi letter to the UN 
Security Council in which Iraq asked the council to respect the 
provisions of its resolutions on lifting the oil embargo from 
Iraq. 
  A diplomat from Latin America who was present at the UN 
Security Council session yesterday said U.S. Ambassasor 
Madeleine Albright appeared to be very disturbed and agitated by 
the Iraqi letter, describing it as humiliating. She said UN 
Security Council resolutions are adopted by council members, not 
by Iraq. 
  UK envoy Sir David Hannay was also disturbed by the Iraqi 
letter. He said: The letter is the cause of the problem that the 
council is experiencing. When the journalists asked him why the 
embargo against Iraq continues after it has demonstrated obvious 
cooperation in implementing UN Security Council resolutions, he 
admitted Iraq has shown cooperation. However, he claimed his 
country and the United States need some time to test the 
seriousness of Iraq's cooperation. This is a diplomatic 
expression to cover up a position that is hostile to Iraq. 
  In a related development, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz 
last night met with special commission Chairman Ambassador Rolf 
Ekeus. The meeting, which went on for one and one-half hours, 
was attended by members of the Iraqi delegation, the special 
commission vice chairman and some of its members. 
  Before entering the meeting, Ekeus told journalists outside 
the house of the Iraqi UN envoy that the technical meetings were 
good. He said: These meetings helped us clarify certain issues. 
We hope we will be able to complete them quickly. 
  Asked about what he will discuss with Tariq 'Aziz, Ekeus 
said: I will clarify certain basic points. We are interested 
in listening to his remarks. 
  Ekeus expressed dissatisfaction with Iraq's letter that 
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz presented the day before 
yesterday. Ekeus did not say why is he is dissatisfied. The 
letter reminds the Security Council of its obligations to lift 
the embargo because Iraq had fulfilled its obligations according 
to Resolutions 687 and 715. 
  Following his meeting with Tariq 'Aziz, Ekeus told 
journalists outside the Iraqi ambassador's house: We have 
exchanged views as part of the ongoing dialogue between us. I 
must not say anything further. 
  He then said: Every day, we in the commission are 
progressing further toward the future monitoring. We will 
continue the technical talks. We hope to complete them today, 
Friday. 
  Asked by journalists about issues that are still pending, 
Ekeus said: After Iraq's acceptance of Resolution 715, last 
January we received statements from Iraq that were needed to 
start the monitoring. In the commission, we are trying to mass 
all of our resources to start the monitoring and resolve the 
remaining problems, or so he alleges.

  [Text] New York, 18 Mar (INA)--News from New York says that 
the UN Security Council [UNSC] decided tonight not to issue its 
traditional statement which it makes bimonthly when it reviews 
the siege imposed on Iraq. 
  French Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee, the Security Council 
president, told journalists following the council's 
consultations tonight that the council completed its review of 
the embargo on Iraq in accordance with Resolutions 687 and 715, 
without giving further details. 
  This is the first time in three and one-half years that the 
UNSC has refrained from issuing its traditional statement on 
extending the unjust siege on Iraq. 
  Diplomatic sources in the United Nations told an INA 
correspondent that this was due to the division between UNSC 
permanent members, which are divided into two groups. The first 
group comprises France, Russia, and China, which insists on 
recognizing the positive development that has taken place 
between Iraq and the United Nations. The second group comprises 
the United States and Britain, which wants to maintain previous 
UNSC president statements, which usually say that the council 
did not note progress in Iraq's abidance by UN resolutions. The 
United States and Britain insist on this formula, and the two 
countries suffered a severe failure at the council today. 
  The diplomatic sources added that the result of the 
council's 
three-day consultations are considered an important diplomatic 
gain for Iraq, and that the second group, which comprises the 
United States, Britain, and Argentina, have become isolated in 
the council. 
  Following the council meetings, Yuri Vorontsov, Russia's 
permanent UN representative, explained his country's position 
during the three-day consultations. He said during the 
consultations the Russian delegation said there are positive 
elements in Iraq's implementation of Resolution 687 and 
long-term monitoring according to Resolution 715. 
  Vorontsov added that the Russian delegation has behaved out 
of conviction, and demanded that the positive elements in Iraq's 
position be encouraged, therefore, the Russian delegation 
demanded to include in the periodic presidential statement a 
clear paragraph that points to this positive position adopted by 
Iraq. 
  Vorontsov said: At the council's consultations, we clearly 
stressed the need to specify when the long-term monitoring 
measures began and the duration of the experiment. We proposed 
that the experiment be for a period of six months, for example, 
at the end of which Russia would be prepared to discuss lifting 
the oil embargo in implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 
687. 
  As for British Envoy Sir David Hannay, he attempted to 
belittle the importance of the outcome reached by the UNSC. He 
did not make statements to attract the attention of reporters, 
as has been his custom after each and every session of the UNSC. 
  Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright made no 
comment. She left this for her secretary, who reiterated the 
U.S. position, saying: "It is no secret that we want to maintain 
the embargo against Iraq. However, some UNSC members do not 
wish this to happen." 
  An ambassador of a UNSC member who preferred to remain 
anonymous said that the climate of today's consultations is a 
crucial factor that will be to Iraq's advantage in the next 
periodic review due to be held on 18 May. 
  Some diplomatic sources said that the climate at the UNSC 
today was the first of its kind, as there was a clear rift 
between the two groups. It is a turning point in favor of Iraq, 
the sources added. 
  The sources went on to say that U.S. Ambassador Albright 
attempted to raise irrelevant issues to distract the 
deliberations, alleging that her government has information 
indicating that Iraq is massing its troops to attack Kurds. 
However, the U.S. attempt has failed, because the French, 
Russian, PRC, and other ambassadors ignored this attempt, and 
insisted that the statement clearly acknowledge the positive 
developments in Iraq's position. Nonetheless, the Americans and 
Britons maintained their anti-Iraq position, thus eliciting this 
outcome of the UNSC review, namely, the decision to maintain the 
sanctions for two more months pending the next review of the 
sanctions on 18 May, which is expected to be in favor of Iraq.

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Mar (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Najm, Iraqi 
permanent delegate to the Arab League, has stated that 
yesterday's renewal of sanctions on Iraq will have a tremendous 
effect on the Iraqi people and will cause more deaths among the 
Iraqi women, children, and patients. 
  In a statement here today, Dr. Najm described this step as 
one that "will not help stability in the region" and denounced 
what he called "the double standards adopted by the Security 
Council on Arab issues." 
  The Iraqi delegate denied that Iraq had proposed to swap 
some 
Kuwaiti detainees with some Iraqi defendants detained in Kuwaiti 
prisons on charges of attempting to assassinate former U.S. 
President George Bush. He added that this is completely untrue 
because Iraq has no Kuwaiti detainees.

  [Text] Baghdad, 19 Mar (INA)--Today's Iraqi papers stress 
that the opposition to the U.S. and British viewpoint at the UN 
Security Council legitimizes the Iraqi people's options for 
removing the injustice being exercised against them and for 
ending the sanctions which the UN Security Council has failed to 
lift as a result of the political conspiracy of Washington and 
Zionism. 
  In today's articles and commentaries, the papers stress that 
what happened at the UN Security Council yesterday reveals the 
magnitude of the dangerous anti-Iraq plot and underlines the 
deep links between the Zionist and U.S. interests and a full 
U.S. readiness to implement Zionist circles' desires to weaken 
Iraq and curb its pan-Arab intellectual renaissance. 
  AL-QADISIYAH says that the split the Iraqi position has 
effected among the permanent UN Security Council member states 
affirms the legitimacy of the Iraqi position and the legitimacy 
of any move that Iraq might deem necessary to open for its 
people a window of hope for ending the blockade. 
  AL-QADISIYAH continues: Lifting the blockade has become a 
matter of life or death for the Iraqi people. Therefore, as a 
people, they are entitled to do whatever their leadership, which 
is aware of the dark corners of the political plot that is being 
implemented against them, deems necessary to lift the blockade 
by all available means and to reassess all the stands that have 
led and lead to maintaining the blockade against them. 
  BABIL says that the Iraqi people are waging the battle of 
Iraq and the Arab nation together, and that their success in 
putting an end to the blockade means thwarting the attempts and 
plans to besiege the masses of the Arab nation. 
  Reviewing the current Arab state of affairs, BABIL indicates 
that Libya, just like the people of Iraq, is being subjected to 
an air blockade. Meanwhile, Sudan is being subjected to an 
aggressive scheme aimed at imposing an unjust blockade, and our 
Palestinian people have been subjected to a continuous Zionist 
siege since the breakout of the intifadah. The paper says that 
the policy of imposing blockades has been adopted as an 
available means to besiege the Arab nation, beginning with the 
countries rejecting U.S.-Zionist hegemony, and ending with any 
hope for success by emerging Arab powers. 
  BABIL warns the Arab nation against the gravity of the 
schemes to besiege the Arab nation. It urges parties, 
movements, federations, unions, and all social forces to work 
and struggle to support Iraq's pan-Arab position and to confront 
the evil powers. It calls on Arab institutions, beginning with 
the Arab League and its organizations and ending with Arab 
regimes, to adopt a clear and explicit stance against the 
continued blockade. 
  BABIL stresses that the current circumstances experienced by 
the Iraqi people provide a historic chance for whoever wants to 
atone for his sins or the sins being committed in his name 
against the Iraqi people to do so, for such sins have encouraged 
the aggressors to launch their treacherous aggression and to 
maintain the blockade. To atone for their sins, they should 
declare a clear and explicit stance against the continued 
blockade. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH describes what happened at the UN Security 
Council yesterday as an obvious political and diplomatic defeat 
for the United States and Britain and an end for the U.S. 
honeymoon at the UN Security Council, which has lasted for over 
three years. 
  The paper says that when three members--France, Russia, and 
China--of the five permanent members demand that the 
positiveness of the Iraqi position be recognized, it signals a 
change and a number of important facts, most prominent of which 
is that the United States has lost its ability to issue easy 
resolutions and to impose its will on the Security Council. 
  The paper explains that Washington has come to realize the 
long- term significance of this change, which particularly means 
that the battle for lifting the blockade has entered its most 
critical turning point and that the U.S. logic has proved 
unsuccessful unconvincing even inside U.S. Congress. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH continues: What happened at the Security 
Council yesterday reveals a third fact which tells us that 
renewing the blockade every two months is no longer something 
that can be unilaterally decided by the United States. Rather, 
such a decision is now influenced by the wills and interests of 
other countries, because the blockade not only harms the Iraqi 
people, but also the international community as a whole. 
  The paper expresses confidence that month after month, the 
stand of the states supporting the lifting of the blockade will 
become stronger and firmer, thus leading to the emergence of a 
legal argument and a conflict of interests which will turn the 
disagreement that emerged yesterday to a crisis that will 
escalate violently every two months, thus provoking disputes and 
differences, and perhaps a serious crisis, until the blockade 
comes to an end.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary from the "Spotlight on News" </F>
program] 
  [Text] The U.S. Administration has once again pressed the 
UN Security Council to renew the blockade imposed on Iraq's 
people since August 1990. The statement the Security Council 
issued to announce that the blockade on Iraq will continue has 
caused outrage inside and outside Iraq. Political observers 
believe the consultations the Security Council held over the 
last three days resulted in a clear division among the Security 
Council's permanent member states. They were divided into two 
groups. The first is France, Russia, and the PRC, which all 
insist on recognizing positive developments in relations between 
Iraq and the United Nations, as well as Iraq's compliance with 
all the commitments imposed on it in accordance with Resolution 
No. 687. The second group is the United States and Britain, 
which want to keep matters as they are and continue the blockade 
on Iraq's people -- a blockade without justification that has 
become a subject of protest and denunciation by world public 
opinion. 
  The Iraqi position, which leader President Saddam Husayn 
declared during his recent meeting with ministers, as well as 
his call on the Security Council to meet its obligations toward 
Iraq in accordance with its resolutions, drew sharp reactions, 
most of which were in favor of Iraq's rights. This is 
especially true since the unjust blockade began its fourth year 
without any legal, constitutional, or humanitarian justification 
that the Security Council and the head of the Special 
Commission, Ekeus, can use to delay presenting their 
recommendations to the Security Council to begin its weapons 
monitoring program and implement clause C of Resolution No. 687. 
  The rift the Iraqi position created among the Security 
Council's permanent member states proves the legitimacy of 
Iraq's proposals, as well as any other step Iraq deems correct 
to open the door of hope for its people to get rid of this 
unjust blockade still imposed because of the insistence of 
well-known and influential sides in the UN Security Council to 
serve purely conspiratorial and political goals that have 
nothing to do with the contents of the obviously unjust UN 
resolutions. 
  Following the cease-fire that began in February 1990, as 
stated in Bush's announcement, Iraq tried to confront the UN 
Security Council with its true responsibilities to honor its 
resolutions and implement its obligations in order to save 
Iraq's people from further injustice and persecution in terms of 
the most important human aspects pertaining to food and 
medicine. But well-known sides in the Security Council, led by 
the United States, have been distorting the Iraqi position, 
reversing realities, and belittling Iraq's full cooperation with 
the United Nations in order to continue the blockade and the 
crimes committed against Iraq's people, its independence, its 
national sovereignty, and its free national decision making. 
  The general climate prevailing in UN corridors, and even 
inside the United States itself, is full of questions about the 
usefulness of and the reasons for the continued blockade of 
Iraq. This fact frightens the delegates of the United States, 
Britain, the Zionist entity, and some other regimes that are 
trying, through their humiliated positions and their 
subservience to Washington and Tel Aviv, to support these 
aggressive positions with money and oil. 
  World and official public opinions stress Iraq's right to 
prod the Security Council to serve its legitimate right and its 
people's right to lift the blockade and to reject the use of the 
blockade for political and diplomatic purposes governed by 
international sides known for their flagrant hostility to the 
Iraqi people. 
  It is obvious that the issue of lifting or maintaining the 
blockade has become a matter of life and death for the Iraqi 
people. Therefore, the Iraqi people have the right to use every 
way their enlightened political leadership believes to be right 
to confront the mysteries of the political conspiracy against 
them in order to lift the blockade, to reassess all the 
positions that have led to the continued blockade, and to create 
the right opportunity and take the right position and step to 
save Iraq's people from the injustice it is facing as a result 
of the damned blockade.

  [Text] Massive marches were held in Baghdad and the 
governorates today. Demonstrators shouted their absolute 
support for the historic leadership of His Excellency leader 
President Saddam Husayn until final victory is achieved and the 
evil embargo lifted. Their chants voiced condemnation of and 
anger at the sanctions that are being kept in place at the 
urging of the United States and the Zionists. The demonstrators 
also shouted slogans against the conspiracies targeting great 
Iraq, its future generations, and its advancement, with the aim 
of weakening its sovereignty and national dignity.

  [Text] Irbil, Iraq, March 2O (AFP) -- Baghdad cut off fuel 
supplies to Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, in a move 
denounced by Kurdish leaders Sunday as revenge for the UN 
renewing its embargo against Iraq. 
  Kurdish leader Massud Barzani told AFP the Iraqi blockade 
was 
causing the region "a very serious problem." 
  Fuel prices tripled when the stoppage went into effect 
Saturday, with the price of one litre rising from two dinar to 
six dinar. Stocks rapidly ran out, with queues forming at every 
petrol station. 
  Public transport was forced off the road by lack of fuel, 
and 
the streets were deserted. 
  Barzani, speaking at the headquarters of his Kurdistan 
Democractic Party (KDP) in Salahuddin, said Baghdad was venting 
its anger at Friday's UN decision by hitting the Kurds, because 
it was "not powerful enough to do anything against the UN." 
  The UN Security Council renewed Friday an oil and trade 
embargo imposed on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in 
August 1990, despite a split among council members on whether or 
not to publically acknowledge Iraq's acceptance of UN demands. 
  The split, the first since the Security Council imposed the 
embargo, meant the embargo was automatically renewed. 
  Barzani said the UN embargo was also causing Iraqi Kurdistan 
economic difficulties, and called for finanical aid for the area. 
  Northern Iraq has been under Kurdish control for the past 
three years, after it was set up with the assistance of the 
allied forces at the end of the Gulf war in February 1991. 
  Barzani added he was willing, if asked, to play a role in 
helping to solve the problem of the Kurds living in Turkey. 
  A solution in Turkey "must include the Kurdish people and 
cannot ignore them," he said

  [Text] Baghdad, 19 Mar (INA)--Iraqi Prime Minister Ahmad 
Husayn Khudayyir has urged Turkey to adopt a strategic stand on 
Iraq in light of the fact that Turkey's interest is in 
cooperation with Iraq. 
  In an interview with AL-JUMHURIYAH published today, he said 
it is in the Turkish people's interest to have good relations 
with the Iraqi people, because their economy, one way or 
another, is linked with the Iraqi economy and its growth rate. 
  He reiterated Iraq's desire to normalize relations with 
Turkey. He said: We always seek good relations with Turkey. We 
have said this several times. He said he was confident 
cooperation between the two sides will create a state of 
stability and mutual benefit. 
  The prime minister urged Turkey to abandon hesitation. He 
said close Iraqi-Turkish relations are the main factor in 
Turkey's economic prosperity and stability. 
  He also focused on a basic point in international and 
regional relations, namely, the inability of any foreign force 
to maintain a permanent presence on another nation's territory. 
He said all foreign forces will inevitably leave the region. 
Turkey's leaders should not fear taking a bold step to meet 
their country's economic interests by returning to the formulas 
and bases of cooperation and trade exchange the two countries 
previously maintained. He recalled the positive results for the 
Turkish economy when prosperous trade cooperation prevailed 
between the two countries. 
  Ahmad Husayn Khudayyir then touched on the periodic meetings 
Turkey, Iran, and Syria hold to discuss the Iraqi Kurdish issue. 
He described them as an aggression against Iraq's sovereignty, 
interference in its domestic affairs, and a violation of the 
most important principle of international law, namely, the 
principle of sovereignty and respect for other countries' 
domestic affairs. He said Iraq's unity is an affair for its 
people and leadership, not for any of these countries. In the 
future, he said, they will regret their positions. 
  He criticized the three countries for their silence about 
the 
foreign military presence in the region. This presence 
threatens the region and harms the security and sovereignty of 
all the region's countries, not just Iraq. He recalled 
colonialist circles' attempts to use the ethnic and religious 
minorities' card to create problems in countries that seek 
freedom and independence. He reiterated that recent 
developments in northern Iraq were imposed by foreigners, 
expressing the belief that this situation is temporary and will 
soon end. 
  He said Iraqis are not prepared to relinquish any part of 
their national entity. He recalled developments that led to the 
11 March statement that ended the Kurdish problem, as well 
President Saddam Husayn's meetings with the Kurdish leaders, 
including Mas'ud Barzani. At that time, Barzani said Saddam was 
courageous enough to unify Iraq and lay down a strong basis for 
a prosperous Iraq. 
  He then touched on Iraqi-Iranian relations. He said Iraq has 
always voiced its readiness to establish normal relations with 
Iran and has taken many initiatives in this regard, but the 
Iranian leaders say one thing and do another. 
  He referred to the recent negotiations held by the Iraqi and 
the Iranian sides in Tehran. He said the two sides focused on 
the main outstanding issues and agreed to hold further talks 
about them. 
  He urged Iran's leaders to consider their people's future 
interests by resuming normal relations with Iraq, in the 
interest of both sides. 
  Regarding Iraqi assets in some Arab countries, Ahmad Husayn 
Khudayyir regretted that some Arab regimes continue to hold 
Iraqi assets under the pretest of compliance with international 
resolutions, while some Western countries have released these 
assets and enabled the Iraqi people to use them for humanitarian 
needs. 
  He also said direct contacts with these countries are still 
under way in order to release Iraq's assets. 
  The prime minister defined Iraq's principled position on 
pan-Arab issues and affairs and the Arab nation's central 
issues. He said Iraq has not abandoned its pan-Arab policy 
under the most difficult circumstances and will play a great 
role in Arab cooperation.

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmad 'Abd-al-Majid from Baghdad] </F>
  [Excerpts] Iraq is two thirds of the way down the road 
toward lifting the three-year old comprehensive embargo. 
Through patient diplomatic efforts and rational measures -- 
which fulfilled 99 percent of the UN Security Council's demands 
-- Iraq was able to contain the stands of three of the five 
permanent members of the Security Council. This step was a 
political achievement in Iraq's interest because it succeeded in 
surrounding the hard-line stands in the Security Council and in 
bringing states, which a few months ago were revolving in the 
U.S. orbit, to Iraq's side. Iraqi sources said that the split 
within the Security Council is a gain for the international 
majority and supports Iraq's rights in the face of "the idols," 
as stated in AL-QADISIYAH, the paper of the Iraqi Armed Forces. 
  The reaction in Baghdad ranged between optimism and 
reservation. Meanwhile, some sources believe that what took 
place within the Security Council was an important diplomatic 
gain from which Baghdad will benefit in the consultations to 
take place next May. Other sources, however, believe that it is 
too early to talk about the results now. A source at the Iraqi 
Foreign Ministry, who asked to remain anonymous, said that 
Iraq's reaction will be decided after Iraqi Deputy Prime 
Minister Tariq 'Aziz returns to Baghdad. The source said that 
'Aziz, who will return after two days, will brief the Iraqi 
leadership on what took place in the corridors of the Security 
Council and the possibilities that he came up with after his 
talks and meetings there. 
  These sources, however, are still leveling accusations at 
Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN Special Commission, describing 
him as a puppet of Washington and London. Iraqi newspapers 
yesterday did not devote their editorials to this subject, but 
rather carried news reports [as published]. This strengthens 
the opinion that the government's reaction has been delayed 
until 'Aziz returns from New York. 'Abd-al-Jabbar Muhsin, 
former military spokesman and President Saddam Husayn's press 
secretary, told AL-DUSTUR in a telephone conversation that if 
the economic embargo continues Iraq will be forced to take 
certain measures, including noncompliance with Security Council 
resolutions. He added: So long as the Security Council does not 
abide by its resolutions, Iraq will be free to cooperate 
unilaterally with a number of countries and can resort to many 
measures that will affect U.S. interests in the region. Muhsin, 
however, did not reveal the nature of these methods, but said 
that Washington's insistence on continuing the embargo smacks of 
Zionist desire. This, he added, simply means that the 
aggression against Iraq and the imposition of the blockade were 
not just because of Kuwait, but were planned even before the 
Iraqi forces' invasion of Kuwait. Muhsin added that renewing 
the blockade is an attempt to exhaust Iraq's military and 
economic potential. [passage omitted] 
  An Iraqi source told AL-DUSTUR that a delegation led by the 
chief of the Political Desk at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry is 
currently on a visit to Baghdad to hold talks on political and 
oil issues. The source added that the three-man delegation met 
the day before yesterday with experts from the Iraqi Oil 
Ministry. 
  An economic source revealed figures on the size of Iraq's 
commercial activities before the international embargo 
resolution was issued. The source said that Iraq has the 
potential to be the largest trade market in the region and that 
its imports -- which were estimated at $25 billion in 1990 -- 
will increase to $40 billion when the embargo is lifted. The 
economic source said that the economic cycle in the region is 
now crippled because one of its basic links is paralyzed. The 
source advised Britain, in particular, to realize this fact, and 
asked ridiculously: Why does London prefers a 1-billion dollar 
market in Malaysia to a 40-billion dollar promising and strong 
market? 
  Interviewed by AL-DUSTUR in Baghdad, political analysts 
expressed their astonishment at the pretexts created by 
Washington and London to continue the economic embargo on Iraq. 
They said that the issue of the Kuwaiti borders is a bilateral 
issue that cannot be placed under anyone's tutelage. They 
called for leaving the issue for the future and did not rule out 
better circumstances in the future to reach results regarding 
it. Regarding the file of the Kuwaiti prisoners, whom the 
Kuwaiti regime claims are held in Iraq, this file cannot be 
closed easily three years after the Gulf war. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Dawud al-Mani in Damascus] </F>
  [Text] According to a statement issued in Damascus by the 
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, riots broke out between 
storekeepers and members of the general public at Baghdad's 
largest bazaar -- al- Shurjah Market. 
  The statement blamed the disturbances on the worsening 
economic situation with a pack of sugar selling for 13 Iraqi 
dinars. 
  Rioting was said to have erupted during the distribution of 
chickens to fill quotas in the city of al-Fallujah in al-Anbar 
Governorate. Protestors raised placards calling for the 
overthrow of Saddam Husayn's regime. 
  Forces of the regime cordoned off the market and a number of 
demonstrators were taken into custody. 
  The statement also disclosed that the Baghdad regime is 
working on the formation of three military corps, whose recruits 
will be drawn from "the friends", and which will be incorporated 
into the Republican Guard. 
  The statement noted that in the application forms the 
candidates were handed, the question asking whether they wished 
to join the corps was worded to elicit a yes or no response. 
This was intended to circumvent a UN Security Council 
resolution banning the addition of fresh military units to the 
Iraqi Armed Forces. Iraqis are, however, still herded into 
compulsory military service, the statement notes. 
  The statement emphasized that special training camps, where 
entrants are to receive military instruction, are being prepared 
in Mosul, Nahrawan, and al-Kut. The exact locations are secret 
and off limits, save for the trainees.

  [Text] Baghdad, 20 Mar (INA)--The newspaper AL-THAWRAH has 
stressed that the split that took place within the UN Security 
Council, along with the council's decision to stop issuing its 
traditional statement, shows the extent of the positive change 
in the international position as a result of Iraq's firmness and 
adherence to its legitimate rights. 
  In an article today, the paper says that the overwhelming 
majority of the world has come to realize that the United States 
and Britain are involved in a dirty (?political) game that has 
nothing to do with UN resolutions or law. Rather, they have 
come to realize that this game is part of selfish interests and 
calculations aimed at harming Iraq and other world peoples. 
  AL-THAWRAH indicates that the (?Iraqi letter) to the UN 
Security Council clearly supported the Iraqi rights that 
Washington, London, and world Zionism want to deny and to [words 
indistinct] as a result of the imperialist aggression and the 
unjust blockade that has been imposed on it. 
  The paper says: The free will of Iraq and the international 
community has successfully exposed attempts to falsify facts and 
the meaningless [word indistinct] that the representatives of 
imperialism have shown at the UN Security Council. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds that, for the first time in three years, the 
UN Security Council finds itself besieged by unequivocal Iraqi 
facts. Therefore, Washington and London went crazy, and ordered 
their representatives to oppose the issuance of any resolution 
in the interest of Iraq. However, they failed to convince the 
representatives of France, China, and Russia of the tendentious 
U.S. and British argument for extending the blockade against 
Iraq. 
  The paper stresses that Iraq has a fair case and is an 
influential player in the Arab region and the world. Therefore, 
it is not easy to blackout the evident Iraq role [words 
indistinct] that want to see the truth. 
  The paper says that the U.S. and British administrations 
should consider well the changes that are taking place inside 
the United States and Britain, changes which indicate that many 
U.S. and British parties are demanding that Washington and 
London adopt a different policy on Iraq. 
  Concluding its article, the paper says that those who have 
legitimate rights and adhere to their rights and independent 
national decisionmaking, just like Iraq, must achieve a 
comprehensive victory over the powers of evil and exploitation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed political analysis from the "Spotlight on </F>
News" program] 
  [Text] What is the meaning of the serious split that 
occurred in the Security Council three and a half years after a 
blockade was imposed on Iraq; what is the meaning of the three 
no's that Russia, France, and the PRC brandished against U.S. 
and British allegations; and what is the meaning of the 
majority's support for Iraq's position and their insistence on 
praising that position? 
  Three days of debate by the Security Council raised many 
questions, and the Security Council refrained, for the first 
time, from issuing its traditional statement on extending the 
blockade. Instead, it just satisfied itself with a shy extension 
of the unjust embargo on Iraq. 
  Replies can be provided for these questions to clarify 
matters regarding what happened and what is expected to happen. 
The first reply is that the international community has begun 
to understand that the continuation of the blockade is 
unjustified, that insistence on it has become meaningless and 
has made the security Council a subject of accusations, and that 
the insistence of the United States and its British satellite is 
illogic because it seeks to achieve wicked goals that have 
nothing to do with legitimacy or international law. 
  The second reply is that Iraq has been using its goodwill in 
handling the premeditated resolutions that have bad goals and 
that it has met its obligations in accordance with Security 
Council wishes and mechanism, the latest of which is its 
approval of the permanent weapons monitoring. But the Security 
Council has not met its obligations, its position is viewed as 
ill-intentioned and indifferent, and it has resorted to 
procrastination and the take- and-demand formula without 
offering Iraq any of its rights. This has awaken several 
Security Council member states, since the unjustified extension 
of the blockade is not a plaything as it means a continued war 
of annihilation against a nation that fights, suffers, and is 
hurt every day. 
  The third reply is related to international changes that 
show 
a refusal to endorse U.S. decisions and dictates. The 
international community has begun to reject and criticize the 
U.S. Administration and its policies, and even U.S. political 
circles follow suit. This has encouraged many states to behave 
as they wish and in light of their interests and policies and 
not in the American way. An example of this is the Japan's 
rejection of the U.S. economic trusteeship, as well as Russia's 
firm stand on its espionage crisis with Washington. 
  These replies, as well as the firmness, the patience, and 
the 
steadfastness Iraq has demonstrated over the past years in its 
conflict with the tyrant, explain to us the reasons for the 
current absence of consensus on U.S. options. Therefore, the 
first signs of the dissolution of the anti-Iraq alliance 
mobilized by the United States have begun to emerge. 
  What took place in the Security Council means that the 
future 
is in favor of Iraq, and that the key to the solution is 
approaching to the gate of the blockade to open it and to end 
the ugliest crime in history. This is because the current 
situation is being shaped by the will of a growing majority 
opposed to the will of an isolated minority that lacks the 
weapon of logic. Iraq's strong will and its clear and bold 
demand for its rights will certainly decide the issue and will 
enable Iraq to have the final say in the future of the blockade. 
Pending that historic moment, we, the Iraqis, have to be 
patient and to remain highly vigilant.

<F P=106> ["Sidelines" column by Sabri Hammadi: "The U.S. Embargo"] </F>
  [Text] It goes without saying that the U.S. Administration 
is going too far in its anti-Iraq political attitude and that 
this hostile stand takes many varied forms. Perhaps the most 
salient form is the rabid U.S. political campaign which began to 
escalate as the periodic UN Security Council review of the 
blockade imposed on Iraq drew closer. All indications are that 
the United States alone has continued to insist on this unjust 
blockade. 
  The first and most important fact in this regard is that 
Iraq 
has implemented all its obligations vis-a-vis Resolution 687 on 
the destruction of chemical, biological, nuclear weapons, and 
missiles. Iraq has also agreed to abide by the substance of 
Resolution 715 concerning future monitoring of weapon 
manufacturing. This means that Iraq has not left any excuse for 
the United States to continue the blockade. 
  The second fact is that the past months have witnessed many 
serious developments in the international and regional stands 
toward Iraq. There is a clear positive development in attitudes 
of a number of UN Security Council permanent member 
states--France, Russia, and China--on the issue of the blockade, 
in addition to stands by other Council member states. This 
change means among other things that the so-called international 
consensus against Iraq, which the U.S. Administration continues 
to arrogantly claim to exist, is neither existent nor possible 
to realize, that only the Clinton administration, as we have 
said, is insisting on continuing the embargo imposed on Iraq 
despite the eroding justifications and causes of this embargo. 
  Moreover, this hostile and indiscriminate U.S. hostility to 
Iraq is paralleled by an international awareness, which is 
deepening and expanding every day, that Iraq carried out all the 
measures and abided by all the obligations imposed on it by the 
UN Security Council resolutions despite their injustice and 
unfairness, and that it is time to deal objectively and fairly 
with the blockade and implement Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687, 
which clearly links the implementation of its provisions with 
lifting the blockade on Iraq. 
  The question that springs to the mind is: What is behind 
this immoral and inhuman U.S. attitude toward Iraq? Why does 
the U.S. Administration indulge in its arrogance and its hostile 
and unbridled policy against Iraq? What will the United States 
reap from this war of starvation and poverty which it is 
launching against Iraq? 
  In my humble opinion, the current U.S. foreign policy 
represents the ugliest form of arrogance, tyranny, and brute 
force. It may be said that the U.S. arrogance has reached its 
peak these days despite the appearance of international evidence 
and factors which indicate that the entire international 
community, including states that are allied to the United 
States, has started to take notice of this arrogance and its 
dangers. These states have started to grumble and even to move 
in one form or another against this high-handed and tyrannical 
U.S. policy. Differences have cropped up between the United 
States and its Western allies and Japan. 
  The Zionist lobby is tightening its grip on the Clinton 
administration in a way unparalleled in previous 
administrations. Reports from the United States speak of the 
Zionist lobby's increasing influence on U.S. decisionmaking, 
especially in foreign affairs. It seems that the Clinton 
administration has definitively linked the preservation of U.S. 
interests in Arab region with the preservation of Zionist 
entity's strategic supremacy over the Arab nation. Can the 
Zionist lobby forget that among the Arab countries only Iraq was 
capable of undermining the foundations of the Zionist security 
theory and to come close to realizing parity with "Israel?" 
  It can be argued that this hostile and conspiratorial 
attitude toward Iraq--this wrong U.S. attitude against Iraq in 
particular and against all states that differ with U.S. policy 
and opinion in general--is due to the Clinton administration's 
inability to understand the Iraqi question and the conditions 
and policy of Iraq, as well as the conditions of the region in 
general, and the administration's failure to understand the 
political, social, and historical facts to enable it to take the 
right stand toward Iraq. This U.S. political inability is due to 
ignorance and inexperience, as well as the U.S. decisionmakers' 
lack of coherence, clarity, and comprehensive understanding of 
international political problems. 
  The United States realizes that its aggression against Iraq 
has failed, that it did not succeed in realizing the basic 
targets it had sought from this aggression. This feeling of 
failure, impotency, and bitterness has prompted the United 
States to continue its aggression and blockade on Iraq and to 
continue its arrogance and feverish attempts to harm the Iraqi 
people and encroach on their will and national dignity. 
  In light of all these facts and motives, it can be said that 
the blockade imposed on our people and country for almost four 
years will become--and it could already be--a U.S. blockade 
which Iraq rejects ad strongly resist. No doubt, all the 
fair-minded people and revolutionaries will take Iraq's side 
against this U.S. blockade.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati by </F>
Zaki Shihab in Tehran; date not given] 
  [Text] [Shihab] Last week, you invited the foreign 
ministers of the Islamic states to an extraordinary meeting to 
discuss the implications of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in 
Hebron. What can the Islamic states' foreign ministers offer 
other than a statement of condemnation and denunciation? 
  [Velayati] I have asked the chairman of the Islamic 
Conference Organization [ICO] and the Pakistani foreign minister 
to call for an extraordinary conference of the Islamic states' 
foreign ministers. We are still working to convene this 
meeting. I believe the Islamic nation must express its attitude 
in this regard, and condemn what has happened in Hebron. 
  We are seeking a unified position. For what has happened to 
the Palestinians in the occupied territories pains us all. We 
must take deterrent, firm, and decisive positions that make 
whoever entertains the notion of encroaching upon the Islamic 
nation experience a great deal of hesitation before he embarks 
on such encroachments. 
  For more than half a century, the Palestinian people have 
continued to suffer from massacres at the hands of the Zionists, 
not to mention the harsh treatment accorded to them. We must 
learn from our Islamic history and support all Muslims who have 
come under the pressure of their enemies. 
  [Shihab] What can you offer the victims of the massacre, 
other than prayers? 
  [Velayati] There are various means of extending support. The 
most important form of support is political support, as well as 
the application of international pressure on the aggressor. 
When we speak of such means of support, we do not exclude other 
means of support. 
  [Shihab] Such as what? 
  [Velayati] I do not want to divulge the measures that I have 
in mind, and what we, as Islamic states, can do to mitigate the 
Palestinians' sufferings. Some of the measures we will take 
will be confidential. 
  [Shihab] Iran has opposed the peace agreement the PLO and 
Israel signed in Washington in September 1993. Why have you 
opposed the agreement? Will you take a similar position if 
Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan sign similar agreements with Israel? 
  [Velayati] Well, when we express such a position toward this 
agreement, this means that we do not approve of a certain 
policy. But, as you know, our opposition to such agreements does 
not mean that we will have disputes with the countries to which 
we are bound by strong ties, or that we will sever our ties with 
them. 
  We maintain strong relations with Syria. We have 
communicated to our Syrian friends in no uncertain terms that we 
are opposed to the agreement or whatever has to do with making 
peace with Israel. 
  We know Syria has its own thoughts on this particular issue 
and it is playing a clear role in the anti-Zionist effort. 
However, we realize Syria is coming under intense pressure not 
only in regard to its position on the Israeli occupation of the 
Golan Heights but in regard to south Lebanon as well. 
  If we understand Syria's position, this is not to say that 
we 
will support whatever agreement it signs with Israel. Syria has 
its own clear, independent policy. The same goes for us. 
  [Shihab] How did Syria respond to your observations about a 
possible agreement with Israel? 
  [Velayati] As I have already pointed out, we talked with our 
Syrian brothers frankly. At the same time, we are all aware of 
the support Syria has made available to the Palestinian cause in 
all areas. Syria continues to extend support to the Palestinian 
cause. You are aware that the 10 Palestinian factions opposed to 
the peace agreement with Israel are still active in Damascus. 
  [Shihab] Iranian news media said that after the al-Asad- 
Clinton summit, Syria would send an envoy to Tehran to brief you 
on the outcome. Did they send one? 
  [Velayati] No one came to Tehran. 
  [Shihab] Has Syria tried to mediate between Iran and the 
United States? 
  [Velayati] As I have said, Syria did not send any envoy to 
brief us on the talks between al-Asad and Clinton. 
  [Shihab] Why? 
  [Velayati] You must ask the Syrian brothers. I must point 
out, however, that there is no precedent for this. In the past 
two decades, there have been meetings between President al-Asad 
and former U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon. 
Syria did not send an envoy to brief us on those talks. 
  [Shihab] We have been hearing for some time that President 
al- Asad will visit Tehran. Will the visit take place soon? 
  [Velayati] This is likely. The Iranian president. Hashemi- 
Rafsanjani, visited Damascus twice, but President al-Asad came 
here only once. 
  [Shihab] This month, or next month? 
  [Velayati] We have not yet decided on the proper time for 
this visit. Nonetheless, I believe it will be made in the near 
future. 
  [Shihab] Do you believe the military action that Hizballah 
and the Palestinian factions initiated from southern Lebanon 
will continue if Israel agrees to withdraw from there, and signs 
a peace agreement with the Lebanese Government? 
  [Velayati] I do not know, because the Palestinians and 
Lebanese will have to decide this for themselves. We do not 
want to force our own dictates on them. The Lebanese are 
engaged in acts of self-defense and waging a jihad to liberate 
their occupied territories. I do not know what will happen in 
the future. 
  [Shihab] Security in the Gulf is a critical and thorny issue 
for the countries of the region. How does Iran perceive its 
role in the region? To what extent is it willing to cooperate 
with its neighbors in this regard? 
  [Velayati] Safeguarding security in the Gulf region is a 
critical issue for all countries of the region. This issue is 
of strategic importance for all states, be they Iran, Iraq, or 
the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] members. I believe the six 
Gulf countries, namely, the six GCC members, may not, at 
present, agree to cooperate with Iraq in this regard. 
Nonetheless, we believe in the importance of this cooperation 
to promote stability and security. If there is tension for 
whatever reason, we all are dutybound to work to defuse tension 
through understanding and dialogue. 
  [Shihab] Since you are speaking of defusing tension through 
understanding, I would like to pose the following question to 
you. Regarding your dispute with the United Arab Emirates [UAE] 
over the islands of Abu Musa, Tunb al-Sughra, and Tunb al-Kubra, 
you were reported to have said that there is a third party that 
seeks to maintain tension in the region in general, and between 
the UAE and Iran in particular. Can you name this party? 
  [Velayati] It is not a single party. Some seek to take 
advantage of aggravated tension in the region in order to create 
additional reasons and justifications for the presence of some 
Western powers in the Gulf region. These parties are creating 
problems and promoting tension among states. 
  [Shihab] Are you planning to visit Iraq soon, as some 
reports 
have said, in the aftermath of a recent visit to Tehran by a 
senior Iraqi official? 
  [Velayati] This is contingent upon the success of the steps 
undertaken to implement Security Council Resolution 598. The 
most important things we expect in this regard is swapping 
prisoners of war, redrawing the disputed border, which was the 
scene of a devastating and wicked war, and various other 
measures, as well. 
  The materialization of my visit to Baghdad is largely 
contingent upon progress in resolving the issues I have just 
mentioned. I hope Iraq will honor its commitments toward these 
issues so we may take a new step toward the future. 
  [Shihab] What about your relations with Saudi Arabia and an 
exchange of visits and envoys? 
  [Velayati] In the past, there were dark clouds in relations 
between Saudi Arabia and Iran. However, if we look at the 
course of these relations recently, we will find improvement in 
these relations. 
  Our relations with Saudi Arabia are positive; we are looking 
forward to developing and strengthening them in the future. 
  [Shihab] A senior Iranian official described the 
establishment of a Kurdish state in northern Iraq as the 
creation of a new Israel that is rejected by Iran. Why? Are 
you worried about the strong cooperation between Western 
countries and some major Kurdish parties in the region? 
  [Velayati] We fully believe in the importance of maintaining 
the unity of Iraq -- territory and people -- and its 
independence, regardless of who is running its affairs. Iran 
believes the continuation of Iraq, with its present and 
recognized borders, is important to the stability and security 
of the region. If anyone tries to set up an independent state 
in northern or southern Iraq this will be considered a threat to 
Iran's security and we will face this with firmness. 
  [Shihab] What obstructs any improvement in your relations 
with the Egyptian Government? What is your opinion about the 
accusations that Iran supports some extremist Islamic movements 
in Egypt? 
  [Velayati] Fortunately, the Egyptian interior minister 
recently announced that there is no evidence of Iran's support 
for the fundamentalist Islamic movements or of its interference 
in Egypt's internal affairs. In the past, we were victims of 
such accusations. We were the target of severe media campaigns 
by the Egyptian papers. We, meanwhile, denied such accusations. 
The conviction of the Egyptian political leadership that Iran 
has not practiced any illegal activities in Egypt or interfered 
in Egypt's internal affairs is an important sign regarding the 
return of Egyptian- Iranian relations to normal. 
  [Shihab] Does this mean that we will see improvement in 
bilateral relations very soon, if not an exchange of official 
visits? 
  [Velayati] Yes, I believe this, because it has been proven 
that we are innocent of all charges leveled against us. 
  [Shihab] When will the UAE foreign minister visit Tehran to 
discuss the islands crisis, especially since a previously 
scheduled visit was canceled? 
  [Velayati] I extended in the past, and now I am repeating, 
an 
open invitation to my UAE counterpart to visit Tehran at a time 
he sees as appropriate. I said in the past that Iran is very 
eager to resolve any misunderstanding with any of its neighbors, 
especially the UAE, through understanding and dialogue. 
  [Shihab] You speak about the possibility of reaching a 
solution, and on other occasions you extend Iran's sovereignty 
over Gulf waters. 
  [Velayati] What the Iranian Islamic Consultative Assembly 
(Majlis) did was to ratify a law approved by most countries. 
The UAE adopted a similar decision. What you spoke about deals 
with navigation rights, nothing more, nothing less. We will 
continue to be eager to coexist peacefully with our neighbors. 
  [Shihab] Iran's relations with the West, and the United 
States and Britain in particular, continue to be bad. What do 
these countries want from you? 
  [Velayati] This question should be addressed to the United 
States and other countries. 
  [Shihab] What do you want from the United States? 
  [Velayati] We want the United States to stop interfering in 
our internal affairs. This is a basic issue. We want the 
United States to stop besieging our economy, return our frozen 
money, and provide us with spare parts for the weapons that we 
brought from U.S. factories. 
  [Shihab] Do Iran and Turkey cooperate or compete to spread 
their influence in the central Asian Islamic republics? 
  [Velayati] We and Turkey are members of ECO [Economic 
Cooperation Organization] and the central Asian republics are 
members of this organization. Therefore, it is natural that our 
relations with Turkey are governed by cooperation in the 
interest of our two countries and the central Asian Islamic 
republics. In fact there are other things. Turkey may have 
concerns that differ from ours. 
  [Shihab] What do you do in order to resolve the crisis in 
Afghanistan and the rivalry taking place between the Mujahidin? 
  [Velayati] First of all, I want to say that we all pray for 
the end of fighting and for putting an end to war, destruction, 
and innocent victims. Secondly, we are doing our best in order 
to bring the different viewpoints of the belligerent factions 
closer together, because Afghanistan faced total destruction, 
first at the hands of the defunct Communist regime, then by the 
destructive war between brothers. 
  [Shihab] The Iranian capital was packed with foreign 
visitors last week. In addition to the Chinese deputy prime 
minister and foreign minister, Indian foreign minister, and 
Russian deputy foreign minister and others were here. 
  [Velayati] And the envoy of [Afghan President] Rabbani. 
  [Shihab] At the meetings between these foreign visitors and 
President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, the president presented the idea 
of cooperation with their countries to form a regional force in 
Asia that solves conflicts between the countries of the region. 
Do you have information on what the president presented 
concerning this idea? 
  [Velayati] We have begun practical steps to shape up ideas 
that encourage the strong and leading Asian countries to 
cooperate together in all fields. The first step is that the 
strong and politically active countries work out a preliminary 
concept on this cooperation, and later we will ask the other 
countries to join this alliance or grouping. 
  I want to say that a leader of one of the central Asian 
republics of the former Soviet Union was the one who presented 
this idea to President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani was convinced of this idea soon after it was 
presented to him, and used the chance of the visits to Tehran by 
foreign ministers of two important countries, China and India, 
to reiterate his support for the idea. The idea received good 
attention by the Indian and Chinese guests. 
  Iran previously expressed to Indian and Chinese officials 
its 
readiness for cooperation in order to implement these ideas 
through forming special committees. These committees will 
explain the concepts of each side regarding the working 
structure of such grouping or alliance and the role which it 
could play in the future to contribute to stability, progress, 
and the prosperity of the Asian nations. 
  [Shihab] Observers have noticed a change in Iranian foreign 
policy over the past three years, especially toward some 
neighborly European countries. Does this mean that Iran has 
gone back on the slogan of exporting the revolution and the 
party which is not with Iran is against it? 
  [Velayati] The Iranian Government has benefited from its 
previous experiments and began to follow a clear policy. We do 
not deny that this took some time. Following the success of the 
revolution, we were exposed to huge pressure from various sides. 
Therefore, our policy was not 100-percent sound and successful. 
Now that we have gained experience, we have begun to lay down 
firm bases for our policy. Any observer can judge the 
experiment of our revolution if we are compared with other 
revolutions. Despite this, I can say that we have passed 
through various stages: The first stage was represented by our 
endeavor to reach stability; and the second stage was 
represented by our endeavor in the fields of construction and 
planning.

  [Text] Eventually, after a lapse of three weeks since the 
massacre of Palestinians in al-Khalil, the UN Security Council 
yesterday passed Resolution 904 condemning the genocide. 
  In the wake of the Palestinian worshippers' massacre by a 
radical Zionist and his collaborators, last 27 February, and the 
martyrdom of more than 60 Palestinians and wounding of many 
others, the world public opinion once again observed the 
criminal and inhuman character of the Zionist regime. 
  The dimensions of the Zionist crime in al-Khalil went to the 
extent that the Security Council, in its capacity as an 
international institution, was expected to quickly and properly 
react to it. But, similar to earlier predictions, U.S. 
pressures, and the excuse that the Security Council's posturing 
should not jeopardize the peace process, diverted the Council 
from its main course, which was required to be taken in the wake 
of the al-Khalil crime. 
  Political circles have described the delay in the issuance 
of 
the Security Council resolution as the result of harmony between 
the U.S. and Israel over encouraging and also compelling the 
Palestinians and the Arabs to attend the peace talks. 
  Under such conditions, Security Council Resolution 904, 
which 
was unanimously approved paragraph-wise and without any voting, 
yesterday, gave America the opportunity to cast a vote of 
abstention. Thus the vote of abstention came in case of 
paragraphs two and six of the instruction to the resolution, 
that expressed concern over the consequences of the 
Palestinians' deaths in the occupied lands and the need for 
maintaining security of the Palestinian nation, and also 
stressed the necessity for enforcing the fourth Geneva 
Convention in the territories under Israeli occupation. 
  Political experts, despite the stress that has been laid in 
resolution 904 on the need for Israel to provide the Palestinian 
safety and security in the occupied lands, and also Tel Aviv's 
ban on the Zionist settlers' illegal and violent acts, and a 
request to America and Russia to extend necessary support to 
implementation of the resolution, have expressed pessimism over 
any change in the current situation of the occupied lands. They 
believe that the record of the Zionist regime, in its capacity 
as a regime fully backed by America, will bring forth nothing 
but aggression, breach of human rights, and suppression in the 
occupied territories.

  [Text] At last, in its Resolution 904 adopted yesterday 
the UN Security Council condemned the massacre of the 
Palestinians at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. The massacre, in which 
over 65 Palestinians were killed on 25 February at the hands of 
extremist Zionists, has focused worldwide public attention on 
Zionist barbarity and on the grave dimensions of that ugly 
crime. The UN Security Council was supposed to adopt a quick 
and decisive resolution. However, with feeble excuses and 
pretexts, such as the need for the Security Council to avoid 
adopting any stand that might jeopardize the Middle East peace 
talks, the United States forced the UN Security Council to act 
outside the legal framework within which it was supposed to act 
toward such events and developments. 
  It is evident that all this delay in the issuance of the 
resolution of condemnation by the UN Security Council and the 
clear U.S.-Zionist coordination were a planned affair designed 
to encourage the Arabs and Palestinians and force them to rejoin 
the peace talks. 
  The United States abstained on the second and sixth 
paragraphs, which affirm the grave consequences that might arise 
from the continuing heavy casualties among the Palestinians in 
the occupied territories and the need to safeguard the security 
and safety of the Palestinians through the application of the 
Fourth Geneva Convention. 
  Although the new resolution affirms the need to safeguard 
the 
safety of the Palestinians inside the occupied territories and 
the need for the Zionist authorities to prevent the inhabitants 
of the Israeli settlements from carrying out acts of violence 
against the Palestinians, and although the Security Council 
calls on Russia and the United States to take the necessary 
practical measures to ensure the implementation of Resolution 
904, it is unlikely that any essential change will occur in the 
current course of events inside the occupied territories. 
  The Zionist entity entirely depends on U.S. support. 
Therefore, this entity will not hesitate to continue its ugly 
crimes, as it has been doing for over 40 years.

  [Text] Three weeks after the massacre of the Palestinian 
worshipers in Hebron, the UN Security Council, adopting a 
resolution which is devoid of any enforcement guarantees, has 
merely denounced the Zionists' crime. 
  The elimination of the name of Jerusalem from the occupied 
territories in the implementation articles of the resolution and 
voting for each section of each paragraph of the resolution are 
some of what Washington has imposed on the Security Council. 
  Two preliminary sections of the Security Council resolution 
say that the Council was shocked by the horrendous massacre of 
the Palestinian worshipers at Abraham's Mosque and is concerned 
over the Palestinian casualties in the occupied territories as a 
consequence of that massacre. 
  America was the only state which did not agree with the 
total 
text of the resolution and abstained from voting for its first 
two sections.

  [Text] On the eve of Nowruz [Iranian New Year, 21 March] 
and the advent of spring, the heroes of the Mojahedin-e Khalq 
Organization [MKO] carried out an extensive series of operations 
in memory of the martyr mojahed Majidreza Ebrahimi and have 
dealt severe blows to the command centers of the bases and the 
repressive organizations of the inhuman enemy all over the 
country. 
  The MKO headquarters inside the country sent the following 
first brief report of this series of victorious operations all 
over Iran: 
  1. The arteries of the oil installations of the filthy 
clerical regime at the pumping station of Musiyan, which was the 
site of 33 explosions in nine oil pipelines, have been cut off. 
  2. Five oil transporting pipelines were the scene of 23 
explosions in the Bayat oil region south of Dehloran, which 
began at 0500 on Friday morning 18 March. The massive flames 
that are reaching the skies are a small sample of the repressed 
fury of the Iranian people seething against the filthy clerics 
who in the 15 years of their rule pillaged more than $200 
billion of the oil income and filled their own pockets. At the 
time this report was received, the rising flames of the people's 
resistance were still reaching the skies and could be seen from 
a distance on the horizon by the deprived people of the region 
whose natural and human resources have been plundered by the 
clerics' government. 
  3. The heroes of the MKO have attacked the Kharrazi support 
base for the 14th Division of the Khomeyni Revolution Guards 
Corps north of Khorramshahr at 0130 on Friday 18 March with 
mortars and destroyed it. In this heroic attack, the extensive 
installations of the support center of the repressive enemy's 
Corps have been destroyed by the infiltration and epic-making 
attack by the mojahedin. The maintenance and repair centers, 
ammunition dumps, and air defense units were hit by mortars and 
were set on fire. In this valiant attack, more than 150 
Revolution Guards of destruction and darkness were killed and 
wounded and dozens of armed vehicles of various kinds were 
destroyed. The intensity of the attack was such that the 
commanders of the enemy's Corps constantly issued appeals from 
Ahvaz for assistance, moaned and cried "At least send us some 
ambulances," and sent the message: "For God's sake, send us 
help. We have been battered." 
  4. Infiltration and extensive epic-making attacks on the 
tactical base of the 21st anti-imam Reza Brigade, the separate 
brigade of the anti-popular Guards Corps, in the vicinity of the 
Hoseyniyeh station on the Ahvaz-Khorramshahr road took place at 
0100 on Friday morning, 18 March. In these operations and 
heroic attacks, which were carried out by using a variety of 
weapons, more than 60 guards of destruction and darkness along 
with their commanders were killed and the remainder fled in a 
despicable manner. The buildings of the command center, the 
brigade headquarters, auditorium, [word indistinct] and 
ammunition depots, along with all other installations of the 
base, as well as scores of military vehicles were set on fire 
and destroyed. The 21st anti-imam Reza has a long record of 
being a base for suppression and slaughter of defenseless 
people, especially in Kordestan. 
  5. A bold attack on the command center of a battalion of the 
21st anti-imam Reza separate brigade in the vicinity of Istgah-e 
Ahu, on the Ahvaz-Khorramshahr railroad route took place at 0100 
Friday morning on 18 March. In this courageous attack, which 
took place with various arms, more than 300 guards of 
destruction and darkness were killed and the installations of 
the command center of the battalion, including the headquarters, 
logistics, and telecommunications buildings, along with their 
vehicles, were completely destroyed. 
  6. Clashes with the lackeys of the 740th Task Battalion of 
the 84th Division of Khorramabad under the command of the 
criminal clerics in the southeast of Naft-Shahr, took place at 
0930 on Thursday 17 March. In this epic-making clash the MKO 
heroes [words indistinct] who have a prolonged record of killing 
and tormenting the innocent people of the region faced their 
nemesis, and taught them an unforgettable lesson. The lackey 
Major Mohammad Bigleri, deputy commander of the 740th Battalion, 
was among those killed. 
  Following these epic-making operations, the decrepit enemy, 
which was terrified by the continued attacks of the mojahedin 
and the uprising of the people of the region, set up a 
headquarters for [words indistinct]. 
  7. Mines and booby traps were laid on the military highway 
of Sumar-Sarneh in Ilam in the early hours of Friday, 18 March, 
using various kinds of mines and explosive traps on the path of 
the lackeys and patrol vehicles of the repressive law 
enforcement forces of the enemy. This resulted in the 
destruction of some vehicles and the death of scores of 
repressive mercenaries. 
  8. Booby traps and mines were set on the military highway of 
Sumar-Salehabad on 16 March in order to trap the [words 
indistinct] armed mercenaries of the enemy. As a result of the 
explosion of the mines and traps, at the time of this report, 
some military vehicles of the inhuman enemy were destroyed and 
scores of the enemy's lackeys were killed and wounded. 
  9. Traps and mines were set on the military highway of 'Ayn 
Khosh and Chamhendi on Wednesday night, 16 March, and on Friday 
morning, 18 March, by using various mines and traps of 
incendiary materials, which destroyed some military vehicles of 
the enemy and killed a number of repressive mercenaries. 
  10. Bombs were hurled at the center for mobilization, 
suppression, and espionage on Atash Avenue in the region of 
Lulwan in Esfahan on 7 March. The center was set ablaze and a 
number of the basijis and repressive guards were wounded, which 
elicited the praise and joy of the people. 
  11. A vehicle of the enemy's law enforcement forces' on the 
Bijvand-Ilam highway was (?attacked), killing its two occupants 
on 7 March. 
  12. Bombs were thrown at the site of the gathering of a 
number of the repressive mercenaries on the Mohammadabad 
intersection in Mashhad on 7 March. Some of them were wounded. 
  13. Bombs were thrown at the station of one of the 
repressive lackeys at Takhti Avenue, Marand on 7 March. 
  14. A center for plunder and pillage affiliated with the 
Imam Khomeyni Committee was set on fire in the vicinity of 
(Kelachha-ye Gilan) on 7 March. This was strongly welcomed by 
the repressed workers and toilers of the region. 
  15. The stores and warehouses of goods plundered by 
repressive mercenaries in the village of Dehkar in Lahijan was 
set on fire on 8 March, which was a source of joy for all the 
villagers. 
  16. A blaze was ignited at the center of plunder and 
pilfering of the corrupt foundation, the so-called Martyrs' 
Foundation on Somayyeh Avenue in Tehran on 8 March. According 
to SALAM newspaper of 11 March, this building sustained damages 
worth more than 20 million rials. 
  17. Fire was set to a vehicle of the mercenaries at the 
Orumiyeh terminal on 9 March. The lackeys of the corps and the 
mobilization blocked the nearby roads and unsuccessfully tried 
to control the area. 
  18. Fire was set to the offices and meeting and 
communication centers of the repressive mercenaries on Hengam 
Avenue in Tehran on 9 March. KEYHAN reported on 14 March that 
this building burned for seven hours and the damage was more 
than 400 million rials. 
  19. A bomb was hurled at the antipopular mobilization base 
on Mahdiyeh Avenue in Hamadan on 9 March, which forced the 
inmates to flee in fear and elicited the support and welcome of 
the residents of the district. 
  20. The destruction of the vehicle of an accursed lackey on 
North Hafez avenue in Lahijan on 10 March which drew the praise 
and support of the residents. 
  21. A vehicle of the regime's mercenaries was destroyed 
[words indistinct] 
  22. Bombs were thrown at the headquarters of the Sunnis--one 
of the centers for the suppression of the Sunnis--on East Arash 
Avenue in Mashhad on 11 March. It was set on fire, which was 
immensely welcomed by the people in the district, especially our 
Sunni compatriots. 
  23. A vehicle of the lackeys was wrecked in the Babol 
beltway area on 11 March, which was immediately reported by the 
local people. The residents expressed their joy. The 
repressive lackeys then strove to arrest a group of people but 
released them after two days due to mounting social pressure and 
requests. 
  24. A lackeys' vehicle was destroyed in the center of Amol 
city on 12 March. 
  25. A bomb was thrown in the vicinity of the building of the 
regime's Voice and Vision of the clerics' regime in Bandar-e 
Torkamen on 12 March, which resulted in the immense welcome and 
joy of our compatriots on 'Id al-Fitr. 
  26. A vehicle belonging to the clerical regime's 
organization for plunder and pillage was damaged and destroyed 
on the Azadi Boulevard in Mashhad on 12 March. 
  27. A powerful bomb was exploded in the vicinity of the 
house of the accursed Friday imam of Hamadan on the Khajeh 
Rashid Boulevard on 13 March. This was accompanied by 
congratulations by all the people of the city. 
  28. A bomb was hurled at the base of the so-called 
mobilization and Revolution Guards resistance base at the eighth 
intersection in Sari on 13 March, which was set on fire and 
attracted much joy and enthusiasm by the local people. The 
lackey commander of the law enforcement forces of the clerics in 
Sari, Rowhaniyan, came to the Sari radio station at 0800 in the 
morning and appealed to the people in a ridiculous manner to 
maintain security in the city and asked them to keep an eye on 
their offspring. 
  29. A vehicle belonging to the judicial organization of the 
clerical regime was destroyed on the Ferdowsi Boulevard in 
Mashhad on 14 March. 
  30. A vehicle was destroyed [words indistinct] in Mashhad on 
14 March. 
  31. The exploding of bombs and propaganda activities such as 
distribution of photos, tracts, placards, protest activities, 
and numerous gatherings in favor of the president of the 
resistance took place on the various streets and districts in 
Gachsaran, Mashhad, Esfahan, Shahreza, Shiraz, Tabriz, Orumiyeh, 
Someh-ye Sara, Chaboksar, Gonbad-e Kavus, Mahabad, Maku, and 
Tehran 9-16 March. [Words indistinct] took place when the 
inhuman enemy had announced an alert since 12 March for 
combating MKO operations in cities and various centers and was 
in a state of 100-percent alert since 16 March. 
  In the course of these successful series of country-wide 
operations, the heroes of the MKO--'Ali Nuri, 'Ali Kazemi, 
Behruz Majdabadi, Loqman Hajkhanian, 'Abdollah Towhidi, and 
Mohammadreza 'Edalatian--fulfilled their promise to God and the 
people and joined the caravan of eternal splendor of the freedom 
of the land of Iran. These proud martyrs are harbingers of good 
fortune and prosperity for this land and the messengers of a 
social and political Nowruz for the land of Iran.

  [Text] Tehran, March 16, IRNA -- The Guardian Council of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran approves the balanced budget plan 
for the new calendar year, 1373 (to start March 21) with a total 
amount of rls. 69,772.75 billion [rials]. 
  In view of materialization of the figure envisaged as state 
revenues, the Majles approved the total budget rls 10,000 
billion lower than proposed by the government. The general 
budget of the government for the new year has been predicted at 
rls. 32,303.35 billion. 
  The experience of the past two years over 
non-materialization 
of state revenues as predicted by the budget plan, made the 
parliament adopt a realistic approach towards the figures in 
this year's budget plan and to consider parameters outside the 
country effective in state revenues and to base the revenues and 
state expenditure on realism. 
  Of the total state revenues set at rls. 30,048.9 billion 
from 
public and other resources, rls. 2,254.4 billion will be 
provided by special incomes of ministries and state 
institutions. 
  In view of the sharp fall in oil prices on the world market, 
the Majles decided to limit the income earned through sale of 
oil to dlrs [dollars] reduced at dlrs. 10.154 billion [as 
received]. If oil revenues go up during the year, the extra 
amount will be spent to repay government commitments in hard 
cash or to carry out some development plans. 
  In the calendar year of 1372 [ending 20 March 1994], the 
total amount of state revenues from oil sales was set at dlrs. 
16.8 billion, of which according to Majles Vice-Speaker Hasan 
Rowhani Iran got dlrs. 4 billion lower than expected from the 
oil sales. 
  He said that in the course of the first development plan, 
Iran lost dlrs., 6.4 billion due to the fall in value of the 
U.S. dollar against other major currencies. Though the revenues 
in hard cash from oil sales are not much, but the Islamic 
Republic of Iran has reached understandings with the two main 
creditor banks of Japan and Germany to reschedule payment of 
dlrs. 4.6 billion, which is owed by Iranian companies to the 
Japanese amd German companies. Iran's schedulled commitments in 
the past year was reduced by 50 percent and it is expected that 
similar understandings would be reached with the creditors and 
the scheduled payments would be met and the growing demands for 
foreign currencies to pay the commitments would fall. 
  According to the new year budget plan, the Majles allowed 
the 
government to repay dlrs. 1,600 billion by the end of the year. 
  The Majles approved that dlrs. 800 million be spent on basic 
commodities including wheat, cooking oil, rice, meat, and sugar. 
The government was allowed to spend dlrs. 400 million to 
produce and import pharmaceuticals and milk powder. 
  The Majles also allocated dlrs. 30 million to be spent on 
higher specialized courses and dlrs. 80 million to provide 
students abroad with hard cash. The total amount of foreign 
currency stood at dlrs. 1,310 million. 
  In order to finance development projects such as dams and 
hydraulic power plants, dlrs 2.3 billion were set aside for the 
Energy Ministry while dlrs. 150 million was earmarked for the 
sugar-cane projects and related industries. The share of the 
fisheries was set at dlrs. 100 million through joint investment 
and buy-back scheme to carry out its development plans. 
  The Majles said that dlrs. 6 billion are to be spent on 
economic development plans of the country. The Majles said the 
Ministry of Energy is to supply 1,080 villages across the 
country with electricity, while the Ministry of Posts, 
Telegraph, and Telephones would set up telecommunications links 
in 500 villages. 
  The Construction Jihad Ministry is expected to supply 1,000 
villages with drinking water, while the Ministry of Transport 
will improve railway services and construct 1,000 kms of new 
rural roads in the new year. Money coming from the sale of the 
shares of factories under the organization of development and 
renovation of national industries of Iran, will be paid to the 
Ministry of Education for spending on its development plans. 
Another rls. 10 billion expected to come from the sale of 
shares of the factories will enable the setting up of 70 
technical and vocational centers. At least rls. 410 billion has 
been earmarked to carry out infrastructural plans in the 
deprived areas of the country. 
  Two-thirds of the income from taxes on imported cigarettes 
and 60 percent of the customs for export of pistachios will be 
channelled towards the Martyr Raja'i relief plan. 
  In order to finance health services, the Ministry of Health 
and Medical Education was given the go ahead to spent money 
earned through issuing of licences for sanitary-ware producing 
units, on modernizing of laboratories and improving the quality 
of pharmaceuticals. 
  Privatization has been envisaged in the new year's budget 
plan to a large extent. A considerable amount of money coming 
from the sale of shares of producing units under the industrial 
ministries will go towards social projects including those of 
the Ministry of Education. In other words, the budget for such 
projects will not be provided if the process of privatization 
does not continue in the course of the new year. 
  An important objective of the budget plan is to allocate 
state revenues in hard cash for basic projects in the oil, 
industry, energy, social welfare, education, health and other 
sectors for developing backward and remote areas of the country.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by Baudouin Loos </F>
in Tunis; date not given: "On the Prospect of the Mideast Peace 
Process After the Adoption of the Hebron Massacre Resolution"] 
  [Text] [Loos] What is your view of Resolution 904 adopted 
last Friday [18 March] at the Security Council three weeks after 
the Hebron massacre? 
  ['Arafat] There is no doubt that this resolution is very 
important: It reflects the international consensus on this 
horrible crime. At the same time it is a major step because it 
makes provision for international protection for our people by a 
"temporary international presence." In addition, the 
responsibility of the two sponsors of the peace process -- the 
United States and Russia -- is stipulated with regard to the 
implementation of the resolution. Furthermore, we intend to 
have discussions with the sponsors, the Europeans and others, on 
how to implement it on the ground. The sooner the better! 
Having said that, the explanations given by the United States 
with regard to their relative abstention from two paragraphs of 
the resolution on the occupied Palestinian territories and on 
Jerusalem have been received negatively by the Palestinians, the 
Arabs, the Muslims, and the Christians. Especially in view of 
the fact that a memorandum on policy in the Near East sent by 
the U.S. administration to Congress on 1 February specified, and 
I quote: "Israeli-occupied lands known as occupied territories: 
the West Bank, the Gaza strip, Golan, and...East Jerusalem." 
Moreover that was the practical position of all U.S. 
administrations. 
  [Loos] Will you wait for the resolution to be implemented on 
the ground before returning to the negotiating table with the 
Israelis? 
  ['Arafat] I have not ended the negotiations with them. I had 
a very important telephone conversation with Prime Minister 
Rabin on Friday, and before that with Foreign Minister Peres. 
This Sunday afternoon Israeli special envoys will have 
discussions with us. One of the subjects will be the 
implementation of this resolution. I cannot yet say what 
specific problems we will encounter. 
  [Loos] What do you expect on the highly sensitive questions 
of the settlers in downtown Hebron? 
  ['Arafat] There are 43 families and 160 students. They can 
be moved. 
  [Loos] Do you think that that is included in the resolution? 
  ['Arafat] It is mentioned when the resolution calls for "the 
occupying power to continue to adopt and implement measures, 
including the confiscation of arms, to prevent illegal acts of 
violence by Israeli settlers." 
  [Loos] The removal of the settlers is not specifically 
mentioned... 
  ['Arafat] Even Rabin has said that installing those settlers 
in Hebron was "a stupid plan" and he was opposed to it when he 
was prime minister in the seventies. Nine ministers in his 
cabinet support their removal. Where to? They can be installed 
in Qiryat Arba', the colony situated just outside Hebron. We 
must prevent an explosion. 
  [Loos] What do you expect from the Europeans in the short 
term? 
  ['Arafat] I am in constant contact with them at several 
levels, even in the context of the implementation of the 
resolution which has all the more support from them because 
three of the text's authors are European -- Spain, France, and 
Britain. 
  [Loos] Do they think that the international presence should 
be an armed presence? 
  ['Arafat] The form of the international presence still has 
to 
be negotiated with the Israelis and the two sponsors of the 
peace process. But we stress: Who can imagine unarmed forces 
sent to highly tense places being effective in protecting the 
Palestinian population and the holy places? We are not asking 
for tanks and helicopters, just for light weapons. 
  [Loos] Should Hebron be the main target of this force? 
  ['Arafat] We hope so! It is these populations which have 
most need of security and peace. Do not forget that part of the 
Israeli Army was involved in the Hebron events. Some of their 
soldiers fired outside the mosque, according to the Israeli 
investigation. And, over the past 22 days, another massacre has 
taken place: 41 dead, 470 injured, 1,500 arrested... 
  [Loos] Do you still think that the Israelis will honor the 
13 
April deadline (stipulated in the Declaration of Principle 
signed in Washington) for the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and 
Jericho? 
  ['Arafat] If the will is there, it is there! When they 
withdrew from Gaza in 1956, it took them six hours. And their 
own experts now assess the necessary time to be six days. 
Moreover, our security forces are ready to replace them. It 
will be a crucial test of their goodwill. When Rabin says there 
"are no sacrosanct dates," I must contradict: There are 
sacrosanct dates otherwise there is no longer a sacrosanct 
agreement! 
  [Loos] What do you say to the Palestinians who think that 
the 
main mistake was not to deal with the fate of the Jewish 
settlements in the Washington agreement? 
  ['Arafat] It was not a mistake. We know that it is a very 
important problem. Any agreement is a compromise, but it takes 
goodwill on both sides. That is why we say: Let us discuss it 
as soon as possible, let us not necessarily wait for the start 
of the third year of the process started in Washington. Nobody 
seriously thinks that the Jewish settlers will leave the 
occupied territories in a week or a month. We must therefore 
start to discuss this question without delay. 
  [Loos] Do you have any indication of the Israeli intentions 
in this connection? 
  ['Arafat] If they want to implement the (Washington) 
agreement with accuracy and honesty, they must put this question 
on the agenda. I cannot say any more at this stage. 
  [Loos] Many Palestinians thought that the agreement which 
you 
signed on 11 February in Cairo with Mr. Peres on the security 
issue is a complete Israeli victory to the extent that you have 
made all the concessions unilaterally... 
  ['Arafat] This idea was put about after Peres, defending the 
agreement signed in Cairo in the Knesset, said that it 
represented a "great victory." I do not know what victory he 
was talking about. Unless he was referring to the fact that the 
deadlock had finally been broken in the negotiations. The 
victory was therefore on both sides and also on the side of 
peace. But, after the Hebron massacre, the whole peace process 
lost its credibility. 
  [Loos] What is your reaction when Palestinian crowds deride 
you? 
  ['Arafat] That is not true. They are deriding the peace 
process which has not produced any practical results in seven 
months! And they have no confidence in the Israeli authorities' 
ability to implement the Washington Declaration of Principles.

  [Text] Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, PLO Executive Committee member, 
has said that the PLO welcomes the UN Security Council 
resolution which denounced the al-Ibrahimi Mosque Massacre in 
Hebron and regards it a step toward helping resume the peace 
process. 
  In a statement to REUTER, 'Abd-Rabbuh said that the PLO will 
receive an Israeli delegation within the next few days to 
discuss measures that will provide security for Palestinians in 
the occupied territory. 'Abd-Rabbuh added that PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat has no plans to meet with Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres in Cairo tomorrow, as was reported earlier. 
  'Abd-Rabbuh said that what is important for Palestinians is 
to implement the UN Security Council resolution on the Hebron 
massacre and for the Israeli Government to adopt full and 
tangible measures in this regard. 'Abd-Rabbuh said that the 
U.S. coordinator, Dennis Ross, proposed such a meeting in a 
telephone call to 'Arafat last Thursday.

<F P=106> [Report by Tawfiq 'Abid] </F>
  [Excerpts] The United States has given us a useless 
condemnation, and dissociated holy Jerusalem from the 
Palestinian territories occupied since 1967. This is the best 
international reward for Israeli aggressors because the victims 
have accepted an international resolution that will join the 
archives of hundreds of similar resolutions that have been left 
unheeded at the world body. Consequently, this resolution 
reflects their own position. It is not supportive of our 
grievances. 
  After two weeks of U.S. procrastination, we have seen a 
"lame" UN Security Council [UNSC] resolution condemning the holy 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. This resolution has failed to 
firmly handle the main causes of the massacre; namely, the 
continued occupation, settlement activities, and the terrorism 
of settlers. 
  This is the gist of statements made by four Palestinian 
officials in reaction to UNSC Resolution 904, and the shock the 
Clinton Administration has delivered to the Arab and Islamic 
nations with regard to Jerusalem. 
  For his part, PLO Executive Committee member Sulayman 
al-Najjab said that the resolution is not commensurate with the 
Hebron massacre and the ensuing massacres committed by the 
Israeli Army. This resolution has failed to ensure the 
nonrecurrence of similar massacres. It has failed to provide 
protection for the Palestinian people. Likewise, it has evaded 
any talk of settlements, and the conduct of settlers, although 
the settlements constitute time bombs that will jeopardize the 
security of the Palestinian people and the entire peace process, 
as well, al-Najjab argued. 
  Al-Najjab added that the U.S. conduct, which obstructed the 
passage of this resolution for three weeks and rendered its 
passage a difficult task, will be maintained. Consequently, it 
will undermine any positive aspects that could be found in this 
resolution. Given all this, one can say that the said 
resolution marks a qualitative leap in the United States' 
efforts to wriggle out of its commitment to the content of 
Resolution 242, the invitation to the Madrid conference, and 
even the letter of assurances delivered to the Palestinians, 
particularly since the United States has defied the world by 
refusing to acknowledge that Jerusalem is occupied territory. 
  Al-Najjab went on to say: The U.S. position has torpedoed 
the very foundations of the peace process, because it reflects 
full support for the Israeli position. Besides, this U.S. 
position will nurture Israeli intransigence and provide Israel 
with greater elbow room to interpret the Declaration of 
Principles as it wishes. 
  Al-Najjab believes that the resolution does not provide any 
justifications for the Tunis-headquartered Palestinian 
leadership to return to the negotiating table. Before any 
return to the negotiations, the Palestinian people's unanimous 
demands for effective international protection, evicting the 
settlers in Hebron, Gaza, Jericho, and other areas where there 
is room for friction between the Palestinians and settlers, and 
placing the issue of settlements at the top of the interim 
period talks agenda must be met, especially since these demands 
have enjoyed extensive support from the Arabs and the world in 
general. 
  Al-Najjab added: With regard to Jerusalem, the U.S. position 
toward it requires urgent consultations and moves by all Arab 
sides that adhere to the Arab identity of Jerusalem. The Arab 
sides must reply to this Israeli [as published] position, and 
take the necessary practical measures to safeguard the Arab 
identity of Jerusalem, and confront the persistent Israeli 
scheme to consecrate its annexation to Israel. 
  The PLO Executive Committee member said: This is the 
responsibility of all honorable people in the world. Unified 
positions can make the U.S. Administration reconsider its 
positions, which are hostile to Jerusalem, and which do not 
support a peace agreement grounded in the implementation of the 
relevant international legitimacy resolutions. 
  For his part, Taysir Qub'ah, deputy speaker of the 
Palestine National Council [PNC], said: The effects of the U.S. 
pressures and dictates are clear, not only in the obstruction of 
the UNSC deliberations on the Hebron massacre, but also in the 
text, terms of reference, and contents of Resolution 904, not to 
mention the mechanism of voting on said resolution. [passage 
omitted] Qub'ah added: Now that the [U.S.] positions have been 
exposed, and given the current dangerous state of affairs, I 
demand the continued suspension of the negotiations. I also 
believe that the Palestinian leadership must not succumb to U.S. 
and Israeli blackmail. I strongly believe that we should no 
longer deem the United States an honest sponsor or broker, given 
U.S. practices, the last of which has been rewarding Israel for 
its massacre by granting it our Jerusalem, the holiest of all 
holy places, as well as our holy land, the land of prophets and 
messengers. This U.S. position is the height of bias toward 
Israel. It constitutes a flagrant retreat from the positions of 
successive U.S. Administrations since the occupation of the holy 
city, a violation of the letter of assurances, and a scuttling 
of the negotiating process, particularly since the sponsor of 
the peace talks has shown a blatant bias toward Israeli demands 
regarding Jerusalem. 
  Qub'ah went on to say: This U.S. position has killed the 
erroneous wagers some have entertained. It has also shown 
flagrant deception. Hence, it requires a reconsideration of the 
bases, terms of reference, and mechanisms of the peace process, 
beginning with the Madrid conference terms of reference, and 
ending with the Washington and Cairo agreements, which have 
produced unfair, unscrupulous, and inequitable agreements--the 
agreements signed in Oslo and Cairo. 
  As for Taysir Khalid, member of the Political Bureau of the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, he has 
condemned the statements made by the U.S. delegate to the United 
Nations, as well as her determination to deny the Palestinian 
people their right to sovereignty over their territory, and to 
deem the West Bank, Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip disputed 
territories. He also condemned the U.S. position on several 
paragraphs of the said resolution, particularly those regarding 
Jerusalem and settlements. He denounced the U.S. 
Administration's determination to rule out the dispatch of 
international troops to the occupied territories to provide the 
Palestinians of the occupied territories with international 
protection. He added that this reflects this administration's 
disavowal of international legitimacy and international 
legitimacy resolutions, including those the previous U.S. 
Administrations endorsed. 
  Khalid urged the authoritarian Tunis-headquartered 
Palestinian leadership to denounce this U.S. position and halt 
the negotiations until the U.S. Administration and the Israeli 
Government commit themselves to disarming settlers, dismantling 
settlements, ensuring true and effective international 
protection for the Palestinian people, and rebuilding the 
negotiating process on the relevant international legitimacy 
resolutions, including UNSC Resolutions 242 and 338, and the 
refugees' right to repatriation on the basis of Resolution 194, 
as well as the principle of trading land for peace. 
  Khalid went on to say: This leadership must respect the free 
will of the Palestinian people, who are demanding a halt to the 
negotiations. Or else, it must tender its resignation and call 
for an extraordinary PNC session to elect a new Palestinian 
leadership that could shoulder its responsibilities toward its 
people, defend their rights and interests, comply with PNC 
resolutions, and lead the Palestinian people's struggle to 
regain their national rights to repatriation, 
self-determination, and national independence. 
  Dr. Labin Qamhawi, a well-known intellectual, said that the 
U.S. handling of the draft resolution condemning the Zionist 
crime against Palestinian worshipers at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
reflects the true U.S. position, which, first and foremost, aims 
to boost the Israeli position. Previous developments have also 
shown the U.S. bias toward Israel. For the U.S. condemnation of 
any operation carried out by the strugglers or mujahidin against 
the occupation has always been prompt. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interviews with Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, chief Palestinian </F>
delegate to the negotiations with Israel, and Dr. 'Aziz 
al-Duwayk, a former Hamas deportee, by correspondent Ahmad 
'Ubaydat, place and date not given; from the "With the Midday 
Events" program--recorded] 
  [Text] ['Urayqat] In fact, the [Security Council] 
resolution [on the Hebron massacre] is disappointing, 
particularly with regard to the U.S. abstention on Jerusalem. 
The United States recognized Jerusalem's status in Resolution 
672 of 1991. Resolution [904] did not discuss the main issue of 
settlements and their gravity. Hence, this resolution is a 
serious step back. I believe that what is needed now is a 
mechanism that can be translated on the ground with regard to 
international protection. We are awaiting the crystallization 
of this issue. 
  ['Ubaydat] But after this resolution, talks will resume 
between all Arab parties and Israel. 
  ['Urayqat] Mr. Christopher actually talked about the return 
to negotiations by the three Arab parties; namely, Jordan, 
Lebanon, and Syria. This, regrettably of course, shows the 
impairment from which Arab coordination is suffering. Regarding 
the Palestinian track, however, the matter concerns the 
protection of people's lives because the peace process means 
preserving people's lives. I believe that without placing the 
issue of settlements at the top of the agenda, without providing 
real international protection for the Palestinian people, and 
without evacuating the settlements from Hebron, Gaza, and 
Nabulus, the negotiations will be useless, even if they are 
resumed, especially since Israel has not yet committed itself, 
even orally, to the principle of withdrawing from the 
territories it occupied in 1967, whether Palestinian, Syrian, 
Lebanese, or Jordanian territories. 
  ['Ubaydat] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat: Will the Peres-'Arafat 
meeting give a glimmer of hope? 
  ['Urayqat] I believe that what is important is not 
formalities, procedural matters, and the level of the meetings. 
What is important is the substance of the meetings. 
Regrettably, the Israeli Government has been taking successive 
formal procedures that have not yet risen to the required 
serious level. Thus, I do not pin much hope on this expected 
meeting. However, all I am saying is that the ball is now in 
the Israeli Government's court. This government should make a 
decision on evacuating the settlers from the centers of Gaza, 
Hebron, and Nabulus and on not objecting to real international 
protection for the Palestinian people. 
  ['Ubaydat] Dr. 'Aziz al-Duwayk: Security Council Resolution 
904 condemned the al-Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre in Hebron and 
called for international protection in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. Do the Islamic circles have reservations over this 
resolution? 
  [Al-Duwayk] Yes. This resolution disappointed all political 
currents in the occupied territories. As a matter of fact, this 
resolution shows that the United Nations, led by the United 
States, is totally biased toward Israel. This resolution does 
not contain any mechanism to achieve security for the 
Palestinian people who were afflicted by the terrible bloody 
massacre. Thus, the resolution is deficient in this regard 
because it canceled the known fact that Jerusalem is an 
indivisible part of the occupied Palestinian territories. 
  ['Ubaydat] But some circles have welcomed the deployment of 
Palestinian police forces in Hebron. 
  [Al-Duwayk] We, in fact, do not need security forces that 
lack the power of enforcement. The whole world is already 
witnessing what is taking place. The media informs the world of 
what happens. Thus, we do not need a new observer to tell the 
world about the number of victims and losses. We are in a dire 
need of real security and peace. In my opinion, this can only 
be achieved if the occupation and settlements are removed.

  [Excerpts] Amman, 19 Mar (PETRA) -- UN Security Council 
resolution 904 condemning the Hebron massacre passed early this 
morning. It has generated various reactions from political 
quarters and key figures in the Kingdom [of Jordan]. [passage 
omitted] 
  Salim al-Za'nun, acting speaker of the Palestine National 
Council, has said the UN Security Council resolution condemning 
the Hebron massacre is disappointing because the negative impact 
of U.S. pressure or the abstention from voting on Jerusalem 
outweighs the positive points contained in the provisions of the 
condemnation. This indicates a U.S. retraction in Israel's 
interest. 
  Al-Za'nun said the UN Security Council's condemnation of the 
Hebron massacre is just for appearance's sake. Nothing in the 
resolutions confirms Israel will take any steps to protect the 
Palestinian people from the settlers' terrorism. He added: The 
delay in the adoption of the resolution has cost it much of its 
importance. 
  Al-Za'nun said circumstances on the international level are 
not in our interest. This calls for a comprehensive Arab 
assessment of the peace process. He said he hopes the four Arab 
countries participating in the peace process resume their 
meetings and coordination in an accurate manner at this critical 
stage. 
  PLO Executive Committee Member Bishop Iliya Khuri said the 
UN 
Security Council resolution has dashed the hopes pinned on it. 
The United States blocked the resolution for three weeks. When 
it was issued, it did not contain anything new with respect to 
the demands the PLO submitted to the United States in the wake 
of the horrendous massacre. 
  On the U.S. abstention on the two paragraphs, Bishop Iliya 
Khuri said that by abandoning its previous stand that Jerusalem 
is occupied territory, the United States has failed itself 
before failing the Palestinian people and the Arab and Islamic 
nations. We see it changing its stand in this era where the 
Arab nation continues to be fragmented despite the sincere calls 
his Majesty King Husayn makes to reunite this nation.

  [Text] Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] has announced 
it rejects UN Security Council Resolution number 904 on the 
Hebron massacre because it does not denounce the Zionist entity. 
In a statement disseminated in the territories today, Hamas 
spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah says the UN resolution does not 
suffice, because it does not call for the evacuation of the 
settlers from Hebron and for disarming them.

  [Text] The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
[DFLP] regards the new U.S. attitude toward the UN Security 
Council resolution as a disturbing retreat from the stands 
adopted by previous U.S. Administrations. The front called 
Resolution No. 904 weak and colorless with no firm decisions on 
protecting the Palestinian people. 
  The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, rejected the 
resolution and considered it insufficient and incomplete. Hamas 
voiced its disappointment with the stands of the Arab sides, 
including that of the PLO.

  [Text] Commenting on Security Council Resolution 904 
condemning the Hebron massacre, a Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] official 
spokesman stated the following: 
  Once again, the United States of America confirms its 
position that is hostile to our Palestinian people and nation 
through its absolute bias in favor of the Zionist entity. 
Security Council Resolution 904 exemplifies this U.S. tendency, 
established by consecutive administrations in the White House. 
  Following lengthy discussions and a U.S. delay, the Security 
Council issued a resolution carefully drafted by the United 
States. As a result, it lacks any real material or political 
value that can end the policy of murder and massacre directed by 
the Zionist enemy against our people. The resolution satisfies 
the Zionist desire to deny any of our people's rights in their 
land and even avoids the minimum level of previous resolutions 
relating to the Palestinians of the 1967 occupied territory. 
Resolution 904 considered that part of Palestinian territory as 
merely disputed territory. 
  The PFLP-GC spokesman adds: After three weeks of watering 
down, the U.S. [as heard] Security Council adopted a resolution 
designed to absorb the wave of anger that swept through the Arab 
and Muslim arenas, while at the same time practically 
encouraging the Zionist settlers to commit further massacres. 
While the resolution condemns the massacre, and urges the 
Zionist entity to take measures to ensure the safety of 
Palestinian civilians, it ignores the fact that the Zionist 
entity's measures and policies are the arms of the settlers and 
the canopy that protects their Nazism. 
  We in the PFLP-GC feel that the U.S. [as heard] Security 
Council resolution confirms the following facts: 
  a. The United States is only an ally of the Zionist entity 
and cannot in any way be a fair mediator or partner. 
  b. The double standards policy is now governing 
international resolutions in view of the U.S. hegemony over it 
and its various standards. While the Security Council denies 
our people the right to enjoy armed international protection 
that would guarantee their safety and security from the 
massacres of the occupation, we see the same council allowing 
itself to interfere in the affairs of an independent, sovereign 
state. Under the pretext of protecting the Kurds in Iraq, it 
sends troops for reasons that have become very well known. 
  c. A host of events that preceded the Madrid-Oslo-Washington 
course and which were part of the settlement process confirmed 
that the 'Arafat-Rabin agreement has encouraged the occupation 
soldiers and settlers to go even further in their disdain of our 
people and their rights. 
  d. Those who welcomed Security Council 904 and considered it 
a moral and political achievement for the Palestinian people 
worked in collaboration with the Clinton administration on 
drafting this resolution in order to escape their crisis and 
circumvent the position of our masses, who believe the 
negotiations and their continuation represent treachery against 
our people and our homeland. 
  h. As we declare our rejection of Resolution 904, we stress 
that the real decision is our people's response, awareness, and 
rejection of all maneuvers and deceptions that aim at continuing 
the negotiations and entrench the occupation. This is what our 
people are exercising through their escalating intifadah, which 
has confirmed the depth of their faith in the inevitability of 
victory and their understanding of the conflict's nature and 
reality. 
  We pledge to continue the revolution until the liberation of 
land and man. 
  [Signed] The PFLP-GC

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with former Hebron Mayor Mustafa </F>
al-Natshah in Hebron by Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz in Cairo, date not 
given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program--recorded] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Mr. al-Natshah, good morning and 
welcome to the Voice of the Arabs. 
  [Al-Natshah] Good morning, thank you. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] How do you see the UN Security Council's 
resolution concerning the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre? 
  [Al-Natshah] I can say that the issue of protection is a 
just 
demand. We welcome the resolution. I hope that it will be 
implemented completely and will ensure real protection for the 
citizens against the settlers' attacks and the Israeli army's 
actions as well. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The resolution failed to refer to the issue 
of Jerusalem. How do you explain this? 
  [Al-Natshah] We regret that the issue of Jerusalem was not 
included in the resolution. This, perhaps, is due to U.S. 
pressure. It represents a serious shift in the U.S. position. 
The United States has often voted in the past in favor of 
considering Jerusalem an integral part of the occupied 
territories. But it is the U.S. pressure that has now played a 
role in omitting the issue of Jerusalem from the resolution. 
All the people have voiced their indignation over this stand. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Can we expect that the UN Security Council 
resolution, which condemns the massacre, will pave the way for 
the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks? 
  [Al-Natshah] I believe that this could help the PLO return 
to 
the negotiations, and I also believe that the Israeli 
authorities might respond to other demands. We also hope that 
the Israeli authorities will also respond to the resolution and 
to the other demands set by the PLO as a condition for returning 
to the negotiations. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The Security Council has called for 
providing 
a temporary international presence to ensure protection for 
Palestinian citizens. What do you think of this presence? 
  [Al-Natshah] The word presence does not mean international 
forces like those that are deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina or 
Somalia. It is rather the presence of unarmed UN observers to 
intervene in one way or another if attacks take place. This 
does not mean armed protection as is the case in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is just few observers in the occupied 
territories who would do their best to prevent any attack on the 
citizens. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The Israeli Government is currently studying 
the idea of assembling all the Jewish settlements in an area in 
the town of Hebron. Could this represent a solution to 
guarantee Palestinian security? 
  [Al-Natshah] The attempt to assemble them in Hebron is not a 
solution. Because the presence of settlements in the heart of 
Hebron has split it in half and has obstructed communications 
between the southern part and its western and northern parts, 
particularly during Fridays and Saturdays when the army bans 
traffic between the two parts of the town. Therefore, the best 
practical step in this issue is to withdraw the citizens from 
Hebron to another settlement as a temporary solution until a 
final solution is worked out, namely dismantling the settlements 
and withdrawing the settlers from the occupied Palestinian land. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What more do you need from the international 
community after the Security Council resolution, which condemned 
the massacre? 
  [Al-Natshah] We call on the international community to help 
place the issue of settlements at the top of the agenda of the 
negotiations. This is a basic demand that has also been 
prompted by the Hebron massacre. It is a fundamental, pressing 
demand and should not be delayed. Because the presence of 
settlements during any transitional stage would be an explosive 
issue that might destroy any agreement. This kind of massacre 
could recur in the future in other areas and could torpedo any 
agreement. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Thank you very much. 
  [Al-Natshah] You are welcome.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Layla Shahid, Palestinian </F>
representative in France, by Mouna Naim; date not given: "The 
Palestinians Are Outraged By Washington's Behavior"] 
  [Text] The Palestinians are outraged. The United States 
literally "payed off" the UN Security Council, Layla Shahid, the 
Palestinian general representative in France protested. It was 
at Washington's wish alone that the vote on the draft resolution 
on the Hebron killing was delayed for three weeks, although the 
text had been amended and the voting procedure -- paragraph by 
paragraph -- had been drawn up several days ago, she explained 
to us. 
  And, above all, this is the first time that a U.S. 
Administration has ventured to exclude East Jerusalem from the 
perimeter of the occupied territories. The paragraph of the 
preamble relating to Jerusalem -- on which the United States 
abstained -- makes provision for the Council to "reaffirm its 
relevant resolutions which state that the fourth Geneva 
Convention of 12 August 1949 is applicable to the territories 
occupied by Israel in 1967, including Jerusalem, and Israel's 
responsibilities in this regard..., condemns, and so forth." 
The French Government even approached Washington to obtain 
explanations on this subject, she said. In vain. 
  Washington's position on the eastern part of the holy city 
is 
particularly serious because it violates the Declaration of 
Principles signed in Washington on 13 September by the PLO and 
Israel, in other words by the two sides most directly involved. 
Indeed, the text makes provision for the city's fate only to be 
discussed during the second phase of the peace negotiations and 
for "the two sides to agree that the agreements secured in the 
interim period should not undermine the result of the 
negotiations on permanent status or anticipate it." 
  Before the vote, Washington "used outright blackmail on the 
Palestinians: Return to the negotiating table and we will 
discuss the measures to be taken," Dennis Ross, the U.S. 
coordinator in the peace negotiations, said in substance to 
Yasir 'Arafat last week, Layla Shahid explained. The PLO is 
reversing the terms of the equation and refusing to be held 
solely responsible for the suspension of the process. 
  The Palestinian general representative thinks that the U.S. 
attitude on Jerusalem is a "negative message, an insult not only 
to the Palestinians but to the whole Muslim world," she said. 
In addition to Washington's attitude, Mrs. Shahid thinks that 
it is "the cowardice" of the international community which, 
through the Council's slowness in approving a text, is another 
"negative message" to the population of the occupied 
territories. Although Russia has the merit of "at least having 
tried" to show the United States that it could not lay down the 
law, Europe, our interlocutor deplored, is totally incapable of 
acting on its words at Security Council level. Before resuming 
negotiations, the PLO and Israel must discuss what this 
"international presence" stipulated by the resolution will be: 
"Will it be UN or multinational forces, civilian or military? 
From whom will they receive their mandate, how many men will 
they have?," Layla Shahid asks. In short, we are not out of 
the woods, and the situation on the ground will continue to be 
at the mercy of all the extremists.

<F P=106> [Commentary by PLO Ambassador in Sanaa Yahya Rabah] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. conduct at the UN Security Council's 
debate of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the U.S. position 
on the entire peace process have at once dismayed and angered 
the Palestinian people and many others around the world. Seen 
in the light of the horrific massacre, the U.S. stand raises 
many questions about the entire role of the United States. So 
much so that [word indistinct] list may be as follows: What 
kind of peace does the United States want? Will the United 
States be up to the role of a true peace sponsor? Is the United 
States willing to explore all the possibilities to make peace? 
[passage indistinct] 
  This is because the long, drawn-out talks convened in 
Washington following the Madrid conference, and then the Oslo, 
Granada, Paris, Davos, Cairo, and Taba talks, after the signing 
of the Declaration of Principles agreement on the White House 
lawn, have revealed [word indistinct] and real obstacles placed 
in the path of the peace process and the Declaration of 
Principles. [passage indistinct] 
  The U.S. argument has consistently been that the United 
States is loath to apply any pressure on any of the 
interlocutors. [passage indistinct] 
  As a result of this Israeli behavior and the (?emotional) 
support for this Israeli behavior [words indistinct] the 
beginning was set for 13 December, 1993 and the end for 13 
April, 1994. Deadlines came and went. [passage indistinct]. 
The result has been that the peace initiative has lost much of 
its luster and the hopes pinned on it have been blighted. Also, 
the Declaration of Principles has lost a good deal of popular 
support and the hopes based on it have waned. Things now look as 
if we are back at square one. 
  The U.S. Administration has been aware of the true picture. 
[passage indistinct] In regards to the Hebron massacre itself 
and the developments leading up to and following the slaughter 
and the participants in it, Israel's effort at a cover-up has 
proved unavailing. The Israeli generals, the state inquiry 
commission itself, the Israeli press, and the Israeli human 
rights organization, have been uncovering more and more facts 
and details that can be proved as follows: 
  First, a massacre on that scale had been predicted. Israeli 
military and political circles had expected similar [word 
indistinct]. 
  Second, with so many settlements and settlers [passage 
indistinct]. 
  Third, the Israeli measures and pledges that followed the 
massacre [passage instinct]. 
  Fourth, [passage indistinct] calling for placing East 
Jerusalem under the heading of an Israeli withdrawal from the 
occupied Palestinian territories is nothing unusual; it fits in 
with the essence of the [word indistinct] and with the letter 
and spirit of the declaration of principles agreement. More 
importantly, it fits in with the [word indistinct] as revealed 
by the appalling carnage at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  Why then is this U.S. position, and why is this U.S. threat 
to use the veto prerogative? 
  We agree with all the parties, including the U.S. 
Administration, that the al-Ibrahimi Mosque bloodbath has 
highlighted the pressing need to pursue the peace process and 
the negotiations, and to secure all the elements required for 
bringing the peace process and negotiations to a successful 
conclusion. [passage indistinct]. 
  The last interesting question is this: The United States, 
which has consistently argued that it does not want to pressure 
any of the interlocutors, is now applying maximum pressure, 
including a direct threat to veto a draft resolution proposed by 
the PLO and the Arab and Muslim groups, as well as European 
nations led by Russia, the cosponsor of the peace process with 
the United States. 
  We have not the least doubt that the United States is the 
most powerful nation on earth and that its ability to apply 
pressure and issue threats is limitless. However, we think the 
world has a need for a framework of legitimacy and neutrality 
and, at least, a modicum of balanced logic. But the U.S. 
rationale that the United States will support Israel even when 
it is at fault and, in the meantime, others can bang their heads 
against the wall [words indistinct] can implement on account of 
its limitless power. But it will serve no purpose. 
  [Words indistinct] if peace will bring dividends to all the 
parties, irrespective of the prevailing circumstances, all these 
parties must shoulder the responsibilities this sought-after 
peace carries.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Brothers, we should not take the recently-issued UN 
Security Council resolution on the Hebron massacre out of its 
proper context, give it more importance than it deserves, 
interpret it beyond what it really means, and, what is more 
important, we should not deceive ourselves. Therefore, first 
and foremost, we say the resolution is only a small step in a 
direction that will make the UN Security Council begin to assume 
its humanitarian and international responsibilities in 
accordance with the UN charter, yardsticks, laws, and 
international legitimacy resolutions, and start to pass more 
serious, effective, clear, credible, and just resolutions in 
favor of the just causes of people and against injustice, crime, 
aggression, occupation, and the violation of the most basic 
human rights. 
  Let us hope this small step will give the peace process a 
push ahead on bases that will open the door to securing 
international protection for the Palestinian people. It is very 
important and necessary that negotiations continue under the 
canopy of a suitable atmosphere propitious for realizing the 
required progress and that enhances trust in the peace project 
and the possibility of attaining peace. 
  No doubt, international protection will ward off the threat 
of Israeli terrorism and ugly crimes and provide the Palestinian 
people with the opportunity to live normal daily lives so they 
can pursue their legitimate struggle for independence and 
freedom. We say there is no doubt this protection, which still 
needs much to become reality, is, alone, now capable of 
spreading the appropriate atmosphere and pushing the peace 
process ahead with serious steps to attain the required 
progress, foremost being the withdrawal of occupation forces 
from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. 
  We wait for the UN Security Council resolution to be 
translated into practical steps so we can speak with real 
optimism. Until this happens, we reiterate that we hope this 
small step by the UN Security Council will lead not only to 
pushing the peace process ahead but to making the UN Security 
Council itself give up the issuance of resolutions in accordance 
with double standards and to stop using two different 
yardsticks. The just causes of people and their legitimate right 
to a free, dignified, and secure life are an indivisible whole. 
Injustice cannot be viewed as a relative matter. It is 
impermissible to tackle it in accordance with restrictive 
political yardsticks. International legitimacy should not open 
its eyes here and close them there. 
  In short, the UN Security Council is now called upon to 
review its repressive resolutions against Iraq and the people of 
Iraq, resolutions that conflict with the UN charter, laws, and 
its famous Universal Declaration on Human Rights. An unjust 
embargo is imposed on the fraternal Iraqi people. Since the 
beginning this embargo has had nothing to justify it on the 
legal, and humanitarian level. It is a very dark and ugly blot 
on the history of mankind's civilization that the international 
community should expeditiously erase. The international 
community must expeditiously remove many dark other blots that 
have brought about the endless sufferings of militant people. 
  Let us really hope this march begins, the march that will 
place international legitimacy in the prestigious position it 
used to enjoy so it will be possible to respect its resolutions 
when they are equitable.

  [Text] At today's cabinet session, Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin briefed the ministers on the steps being taken prior to 
the resumption of the peace talks. Minister Shim'on Shetrit 
complained that Israel's position on the status of Jerusalem is 
unclear. Mr. Rabin replied that Jerusalem is not an issue for 
negotiations at this time, adding that Israel has made no 
concessions whatsoever on this matter. Rabin noted that he had 
underestimated the extent of the widespread support among 
settler circles for the Hebron massacre. The prime minister 
said that the deliberations of the Shamgar Commission, which is 
investigating the Hebron massacre, undermine the IDF's [Israel 
Defense Forces] credibility in the eyes of the public. 
  Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the 
cabinet also discussed the continuation of the closure on the 
territories. One of the possibilities discussed was extending 
the closure on the territories until after the holidays. Police 
Minister Moshe Shahal supports this proposal.

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres </F>
by Eyal Eisenstein on 20 March; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Eisenstein] Last night, the Israeli delegation 
began negotiations with senior PLO echelons in Tunis in 
anticipation of the resumption of the peace talks. Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres told us yesterday that the obstacles to 
peace created by the Hebron massacre are not the last ones we 
will have to overcome. At the same time, Peres expects the 
negotiations to resume soon: 
  [Peres] I believe that official talks with the four parties 
will resume in Washington in early April. 
  [Eisenstein] Peres said that the proposals conveyed by the 
Israeli delegation to Tunis are the proposals of the Norwegian 
representatives, with which the PLO is basically familiar. 
Peres noted that the proposal to deploy Palestinian policemen 
in Hebron is also on the agenda: 
  [Peres] We still have to work out this proposal. It is not 
an exact repetition of the previous situation. We want 
something that will also take into consideration the 
sensitivities and concerns of the local residents. This force 
must be under Israeli authority, however, because it is 
inconceivable to have two military authorities in the same city. 
  [Eisenstein] Regarding Peres' scheduled meeting with 'Arafat 
in Paris on 24 March, the foreign minister said the issue has 
not been finalized. 
  [Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 21 March on page A1 carries 
a 
report by 'Aqiva Eldar on Peres' appearance before Labor 
activists in Tel Aviv on 20 March, adding the following: "Peres 
stated that Israel will not compromise on Jerusalem, which will 
remain under Israeli sovereignty and is a 'closed case' from the 
political point of view but remains open in terms of the 
religious aspects." 
  [Writing on page 2 of Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 
21 March, Nehama Dowek reports on Peres' remarks on the same 
occasion. She quotes Peres as saying: "We will not admit to not 
having the right to live in all parts of Eretz Yisra'el. We 
have that right, but the question is what sense is there in 
exercising it." Peres added: "Goldstein's act raises questions 
about the possibility of coexistence between settlers and Arabs. 
The settlement of 400 Jews among 120,000 Arabs in Hebron 
illustrates the magnitude of this problem. We must decide what 
is the right solution. The settlement map must be a purely 
Israeli decision rather than the result of pressure created by 
the negotiations."]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by Shlomo </F>
Ganor -- recorded in Hebrew with Arabic subtitles on 18 March in 
Peres' office; translated from the Hebrew] 
  [Text] [Ganor] Was your meeting with 'Arafat on 20 March 
finalized? 
  [Peres] Not yet. There are two moves here; the UN Security 
Council vote, which was to take place later this evening, but 
was postponed by four hours and a dialogue, a debate, taking 
place between the United States and others regarding the nature 
of the resolution. At the same time, there is a move for the 
resumption of the talks with the PLO on the Gaza-and-Jericho 
agreement and on the conclusions that have to be drawn from the 
events in Hebron. 
  [Ganor] What about your meeting? 
  [Peres] My meeting comes in between these two moves. It is 
part of the attempt to design a complete move. 
  [Ganor] Can we assume it will take place? 
  [Peres] I cannot tell you before it is scheduled. I believe 
that the talks, the dialogue, will eventually resume. 
  [Ganor] What will be in the center of your meeting with 
'Arafat, when it takes place? 
  [Peres] On the one hand there is the desire to speed up the 
process of completing the negotiations on the Gaza-and-Jericho 
agreement, and implementing it. We want this done as fast as 
possible. We would also like to see this through in a 
relatively short time. The other thing will be the need to see 
what can be done about Hebron to calm spirits and create a 
better atmosphere. It should be remembered that 'Arafat's source 
of power and authority is the entire Palestinian population in 
Judaea and Samaria, and not just in Jericho and the Gaza Strip. 
There is no doubt that the Hebron incident put him in an almost 
intolerable situation. He came under very harsh criticism in 
the territories. In the Palestinian camp, he is the only 
partner we have today with which we can talk peace. 
  [Ganor] What are the steps Israel wants to take to bolster 
'Arafat's standing? 
  [Peres] It is not only a question of bolstering 'Arafat's 
standing. We need to dissolve the tremendous tension which was 
created in the territories, and spread as an angry wave through 
the Muslim and Arab world. We should remember that the 
reactions to the incident are no less severe than the incident 
itself. 
  [Ganor] What are the steps Israel wants to take to help him? 
  [Peres] I will not detail the steps. I will tell you, 
however, that we want the following points perfectly clear: 
First, we bear the responsibility for the security of all the 
residents, including the Arabs. They are nobody's prey. 
Second, we wish to hold a dialogue with the local residents 
about the appropriate steps that should be taken which will make 
them feel they are secure and that their needs are being 
considered. Third, all the means that are needed to create a 
new security situation, as recommended by our defense 
establishment, will be implemented. These are the three basic 
assumptions, more or less. 
  [Ganor] What is your personal stand regarding moving the 
Jewish residents of Hebron into a single site? 
  [Peres] My view -- what I can say outside the cabinet 
session and before a session is held -- is the following: 
First, any decision regarding sites or settlements throughout 
the territories should be made by Israel alone. It cannot be 
made as a result of external pressure or as part of negotiations 
with the PLO. This is strictly an Israeli decision. Israel, on 
its part, must be reasonable. It has to decide what is needed, 
what is logical, what is the price -- and I do not only speak of 
money. We are very thinly spread in very many places, and 
believe me that I fear for what might happen to one man or one 
woman here and there. Not everything can be provided for with 
security measures. The conclusions have to be drawn. Putting 
them on a map, in practical terms, will have to be done in the 
cabinet session. It is clear to me that the way we are spread 
in Hebron is intolerable. We have five sites scattered 
throughout the city in which some 400 Jews live among 120,000 
Arab residents who today feel a tremendous need to protest. I 
fear for the security of each and everyone of them, and I am not 
just saying this. 
  [Ganor] What is your stand regarding the evacuation of Jews 
from Tall al-Rumaytha? 
  [Peres] I am not sure that the Declaration of Principles 
[DOP] covers the issue of Tall al-Rumaytha. The DOP speaks of 
settlements, not of sites which are not settlements, 
neighborhoods, or suburbs. It was established in between 
governments, when one government was leaving and another was not 
yet set up. Hence, the government will have to discuss the 
issue. I will not say what I think here, before a cabinet 
session is held. I will say, however, that Tall al-Rumaytha -- 
just as any other place -- cannot be an issue for negotiations 
with the Palestinians. It should be an Israeli Government 
decision, made by us alone. 
  [Ganor] Does this also apply to carrying guns in areas 
densely populated by Arabs? 
  [Peres] Certainly. That is, a distinction should be made 
between carrying arms for self defense and wielding arms for the 
sake of revenge -- which we will not allow. There is a 
difference between carrying weapons while on the roads or at 
work and carrying arms when you and suddenly go smashing windows 
or torch cars. That is: arms only for self defense, not for 
provocation. 
  [Ganor] How long will it take to implement the 
Gaza-and-Jericho First plan? 
  [Peres] Several weeks. Look, when you ask how long will it 
take to get there, you must first ask when do we start walking. 
The problem now is that we are standing still, hence there is 
no point in discussing the time of arrival at the destination. 
I believe that the fundamental change in the Palestinian public 
opinion will take place when they see a change in their reality. 
  The Palestinian people had two prominent leaders in this 
century: The Jerusalem Mufti and Yasir 'Arafat. 'Arafat has 
been the head of the PLO and the most important Palestinian 
representative for the past 28 years. The Mufti was a leader 
for 40 years. He was the most popular leader. He kept saying 
no, no, no, and brought disaster after disaster on the 
Palestinian nation. He prevented them from establishing an Arab 
state on most of the territory of Eretz Yisra'el. He is the 
only one to blame for this. He caused the problem of refugees, 
and did not allow anyone to solve it. He caused the unification 
of Judaea and Samaria with Jordan, which no one later knew how 
to get rid of. He lived in negation, and this is how he died. 
He demanded everything only to end up with nothing, and brought 
nothing but sorrow and loss of life to his nation. 
  At first, 'Arafat also started off this way. At a certain 
point he changed his way, and said: Let us opt for a concrete 
thing, not something theoretical. If the negotiations succeed, 
'Arafat will be the first Palestinian leader in history who will 
receive, for the Palestinians, a territory, a budget, 
responsibility, an address, a flag -- since the Palestinians 
have never had neither a state nor an autonomy. 'Arafat told 
me: Do you want to make me a mayor of one town? I told him: 
Listen Sir, when Israel was established, there were only 
650,000 Jews here. You start off with 1 million Palestinians. 
This is a great thing. 
  [Ganor] Will Israel help Yasir 'Arafat? 
  [Peres] The State of Israel will help its Palestinian 
neighbor. We have a vested interest in seeing them succeed. We 
do not want our neighbors to live in poverty, fear, or 
bitterness. This would be a terrible life. Furthermore, this 
will spill over to our side as well as to their side. We can 
change relations between neighbors. We have no desire to change 
our neighbors, their opinions, location, or nationality. We are 
making a supreme effort to improve or change the relations 
between the Arab and the Jewish nations.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
Eytan Almog; recorded on 19 March] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Almog] Mr. Peres, in last 
night's vote in the UN Security Council we still enjoyed U.S. 
support regarding Jerusalem's status as the united capital of 
Israel which is under complete Israeli sovereignty. Is the word 
still appropriately placed in the above sentence? 
  [Peres] I do not want to play down the UNSC resolution. 
There is a change, however, in the U.S. position -- and I think 
it is a change somewhat for the better. To date the United 
States on two occasions voted in favor of including Jerusalem in 
the definition of the occupied territories. This time it 
abstained, and the reason for this is that had it voted against, 
it would have in fact vetoed the entire resolution and the 
Security Council would have been left without any resolution. 
One of the reasons which caused the United States to abstain is 
that the Declaration of Principles does not even mention 
Jerusalem. The present U.S. Administration has also taken upon 
itself severe restrictions regarding Jerusalem. The solution 
which the United States thought most appropriate in the present 
case was not to vote in favor -- as in the past -- but rather to 
abstain.

  [Text] It was learned tonight that Israel is prepared to 
discuss a withdrawal from the Gaza Strip even before the 
negotiations on that issue are completed. Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres told today's cabinet meeting that 'Arafat has in 
fact agreed to resume the talks even though he has not admitted 
it publicly. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen gives 
us the political picture: 
  [Begin recording] [Rosen] I was surprised, Yitzhaq Rabin 
said, I did not realize how widespread the support for Barukh 
Goldstein's abhorrent act is among the settlers. The government 
did not make any new decisions today although such decisions are 
due to be made. Yesterday, we reported on the Norwegian 
compromise paper, which the foreign minister confirmed today. 
Mr. Peres said Israel is ready to agree to a Palestinian police 
force being deployed in Hebron. A senior political source said 
that the powers of the Palestinian police force will be wider 
than they had prior to the intifadah. A number of ministers, 
including Tourism Minister 'Uzi Bar'am, again raised the demand 
for a full or partial evacuation of Jews from Hebron. Police 
Minister Moshe Shahal expressed support for such a move. 
  [Shahal] It is easier to defend the Jewish population if it 
is concentrated together. 
  [Rosen] Inside the cabinet room, this demand led to a 
confrontation between ministers. 
  [Environment Minister Yosi Sarid] The government will soon 
have to make very important decisions on the settlers' 
deployment inside Hebron, which is very dangerous and very 
problematic. 
  [Industry and Trade Minister Mikha Harish] I fear a 
situation where some of the ministers, especially the Meretz 
ministers, raise new proposals which will persuade 'Arafat to 
continue to delay. 
  [Rosen] Israel is nevertheless going to meet the PLO half 
way. What is on the agenda now is speeding up the withdrawal 
from the Gaza Strip. The area is already being evacuated. On 
the prime minister's desk is a proposal, which Rabin has not 
ruled out, that the Gaza-Jericho withdrawal take place 
concurrently with the negotiations and prior to the completion 
of the talks in order to meet 'Arafat's demand to show signs of 
withdrawal on 13 April. 
  [Peres] Israel is ready to speed up the negotiations and the 
implementation of the agreement. 
  [Rosen] The ongoing curfew and the closure disturb the 
ministers. Police Minister Shahal suggested continuing the 
closure until after Independence Day but urged compensating the 
residents. 
  [Shahal] The amount must be reasonable. I suggest between 
15 and 20 million shekels a month. 
  [Rosen] The government forecasts tough talks in Tunis. 
Although the foreign minister told the cabinet today that 
'Arafat has in fact already decided to return to the talks, he 
just has not said so publicly. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Political correspondent Gadi Sukenik studio report] </F>
  [Excerpts] Diplomatic contacts between Israel, Tunis, the 
United States, and Egypt continue at this hour in an attempt to 
find a way for an immediate resumption of the negotiations 
between Israel and the PLO. Our correspondent Gadi Sukenik has 
the details: 
  The contacts go on all the time with the participation of 
the 
Americans, the Egyptians, Israel, the PLO, as well as the 
Russians and the Norwegians. The United States has threatened 
'Arafat that if he does not return immediately to the peace 
talks, it would veto the condemnation of the Hebron massacre by 
the UN Security Council. Strange as it may seem, Israel fears 
such a U.S. veto. 'Arafat might, so they think in Israel, dig 
in his heels even deeper, and the entire peace process will 
become even more of a mess. 
  Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa spoke on the phone today 
with Shim'on Peres and suggested that a preparatory meeting be 
held in Cairo between lower level Israeli and PLO 
representatives. As we have already heard, Rabin held a long 
conversation with 'Arafat. Peres and Rabin met twice within 24 
hours. This evening, Peres also held a meeting with Faysal 
al-Husayni. 
  Everything is being done with the feeling that the situation 
is grave; that 'Arafat is in distress as hundreds of thousands 
of Palestinians are under curfew or closure. Israel still 
demands that 'Arafat return to the negotiating table 
unconditionally, and only hints at a willingness to meet him 
part of the way on several issues. At the same time, Rabin is 
against evacuating the Jewish settlers from Hebron at this time, 
despite the fact that he had called them a time bomb and their 
presence there stupidity. [passage omitted] 
  Peres stand is clear. Hence it can be gathered that, from 
now on, every grave incident in Hebron -- caused by either Arabs 
or Jews -- will be followed by an evacuation from or moving out 
of settlers in the city. The efforts to get Peres and 'Arafat 
to meet as soon as possible will continue tomorrow in an attempt 
to break the ice.

<F P=106> [By Patrick Anidjar] </F>
  [Text] Jerusalem, March 20 (AFP) -- Israeli officials were 
set to hold talks with the PLO in Tunis Sunday [20 March] on 
protection for Palestinians and ways to restart the autonomy 
talks stalled by the Hebron massacre, the government said. 
  Sources close to the foreign ministry said the Tunis meeting 
could lead to a meeting Thursday in Paris between Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres and Palestine Liberation Organisation 
(PLO) chief Yasir 'Arafat. 
  A delegation led by chief negotiator General Amnon Shahaq 
will discuss the deployment in Hebron of Palestinian police 
under Israeli authority and an international presence there, 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's office said. 
  The four-man team, was to leave for PLO headquarters after 
the weekly cabinet meeting, to discuss how to restart talks on 
Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, suspended since the 
February 25 massacre. 
  Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir, who is one of 
the delegates, said on radio that Israel was fully responsible 
for the "safety of Palestinians" in the occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip. 
  "There is a demand to deploy an international force as 
stipulated in the (September) Declaration of Principles and we 
hope to put it into practice," Savir said. 
  "These two points can serve as a good basis for satisfying 
both parties and make progress toward peace." 
  Israeli state radio said the government would accept a 
temporary international presence in the West Bank town of Hebron. 
  Rabin said Saturday he hoped negotiations with the 
Palestinians as well as with Syria, Lebanon and Jordan could 
resume after Passover in early April and Israeli Independence 
day on April 14. 
  The other members of the Israeli delegation are Rabin's 
political advisor Jacques Neria and the foreign ministry's legal 
advisor Yo'el Singer. 
  The PLO in Tunis Saturday welcomed Friday's UN resolution on 
the Hebron massacre as a basis for protecting Palestinians and 
restarting the negotiations to launch self-rule in Gaza and 
Jericho. 
  "UN Security Resolution 904 is a solid basis for immediately 
starting the necessary measures to protect Palestinians in the 
territories and for assuring the restart and success of the 
negotiations," it said in a statement. 
  Besides meeting the Israeli delegation, the PLO leadership 
will also consult in the next two days with senior envoys from 
the United States and Russia, the sponsors of the Middle East 
peace talks. 
  The meetings will focus on "practical measures" to apply 
Friday's resolution calling for a temporary international or 
foreign presence in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, a PLO 
official said. 
  A decision on whether to resume autonomy negotiations will 
be 
taken later based on talks involving "all parties, particularly 
Israel," he said. 
  By calling for an armed international observation force to 
protect Palestinians in the occupied territories, the PLO has 
been asking for more than Israel is willing to give.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem issued the 
following statement in response to the UN Security Council 
resolution: Israel believes that the best way to promote peace 
and security between Israelis and Palestinians is by resuming 
and accelerating negotiations on the implementation of the 
Declaration of Principles [DOP] on Gaza and Jericho. In regard 
to the Security Council resolution, Israel hopes it will pave 
the way for the resumption of these talks. Israel was first to 
condemn the horrendous massacre in Hebron and will continue to 
take decisive action against extremists and dangerous elements. 
Israel will encourage any measures to restore stability in the 
territories -- as far as they are in conformity with the DOP -- 
and do its utmost to carry out its responsibility for the 
security of all Arabs and Israelis in the territories. Finally, 
Israel's position on Jerusalem is well known: Jerusalem is and 
will be the united capital of Israel. Any reference to it as 
part of the territories is unacceptable.

  [Text] Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert says the U.S. vote on 
the UN resolution condemning the Hebron massacre has raised 
false expectations among Palestinians regarding the future of 
Jerusalem, and will create obstacles to the peace process. 
  In a letter to President Bill Clinton, Olmert said he was 
disappointed that the U.S. did not veto the Security Council 
resolution, which contains references to East Jerusalem as part 
of the occupied territories. The United States voted in support 
of the resolution, but abstained on citations referring to the 
status of Jerusalem.

  [Text] The Likud Knesset faction has requested an urgent 
plenum debate, during the Pesah recess, in order to discuss what 
it described as the government's far-reaching concessions, which 
endanger the status of Jerusalem and disregard the security 
needs of the Jewish settlement in Hebron. 
  Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that Knesset Member 
David 
Mena' has handed the Knesset speaker a list with the 30 
signatures required in order to convene the plenum during the 
recess. 
  The NRP [National Religious Party] faction has announced 
that 
in reaction to Prime Minister Rabin's proposals, it will hold 
its next meeting tomorrow in Hebron.

  [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 
1130 and at 1600 GMT on 20 March report on today's morning and 
afternoon sessions of the commission of inquiry into the Hebron 
massacre. 
  In the morning, the commission heard testimony from 
settlers. 
One settler, who was praying in the Cave of the Patriarchs at 
the time of the massacre, "ruled out the chance that Barukh 
Goldstein had an accomplice." 
  Dani Gur-Arye reports: "The settlers who came in contact 
with Barukh Goldstein the morning of the massacre described 
nothing out of the ordinary in his behavior. Moti Ungar, the 
security guard at Qiryat Arba' who drove Goldstein to the cave 
that Friday morning, said he was calm and lucid like on any 
other day. Ungar said the two men discussed trivial things, 
such as the medical equipment on the ambulance at Qiryat Arba'. 
He said Goldstein was carrying an Israeli-made Glilon rifle and 
several cartridges. Just before leaving the jeep, Goldstein 
handed Ungar his car keys, asking that they be delivered to his 
wife. 
  "Another settler, Ilan Tur, ran into Goldstein inside the 
Cave of the Patriarchs. Tur said: Goldstein asked me why the 
door separating the two halls in the cave were closed. I 
explained that Muslims were praying in one hall to mark Ramadan, 
while Jews were praying in another hall. He, obviously annoyed, 
said the Jews are entitled to pray on Purim. Tur said Goldstein 
had a gun and an automatic weapon, probably a Glilon. He said 
he later heard shots fired from what sounded like one weapon. 
He concludes from this that only one gunman was involved in the 
massacre." 
  In the afternoon session, the commission heard border 
policemen who were supposed to be guarding at the Cave of the 
Patriarchs at the time of the event, and "all said there were 
clear orders not to fire at Jewish settlers under any 
circumstances." 
  Mark Weiss reports: "All the border policemen testifying 
before the commission of inquiry said they had received the same 
orders concerning open-fire regulations against settlers. Army 
orders were clear-cut: Not to shoot at a settler under any 
circumstances. They were to wait until the settler had stopped 
shooting before approaching him. The judges challenged the 
border policemen repeatedly over the logic of such an order, but 
the answers were always the same: These were the orders, and we 
didn't question them. 
  "Three border policemen who were supposed to be guarding at 
the Cave of the Patriarchs failed to arrive on time. The border 
policemen admitted there were arguments over who should guard 
and problems with the names written on the guard list. It took 
at least 20 critical minutes to locate three people to guard. 
Most of those testifying claimed that some of the border 
policemen on the list were not even on the base at the time. 
  "By the time the guards eventually reached the cave, the 
massacre had already taken place. Barukh Azaza, the Ethiopian 
driver who drove the border policemen to the cave, denied under 
questioning that he had fired any shots despite testimony from 
colleagues that he had fired into the air."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Washington correspondent 'Aqiva Eldar: </F>
"Jewish Chutzpah"] 
  [Text] Among the congressmen who signed the petition to 
President Clinton on the issue of Jerusalem were several 
politicians regarded by Jewish and Israeli lobbyists as lost 
cases, almost anti-Semites. On the face of it, collecting the 
signatures of 82 congressmen for the sake of Jerusalem would 
seem to be a heart-warming achievement for Israel and its 
friends in America. In fact, it was a cheeky action on the part 
of Jewish functionaries, an unprecedented deed in relations 
between the sovereign State of Israel and the Jewry of the 
diaspora, perhaps even between any sovereign state and an ethnic 
minority that bears no responsibility for the consequences of 
its deeds and misdeeds. 
  Only a short distance separated their action from a veto of 
the UN Security Council [UNSC] resolution, which might have 
turned into a veto of the peace process. This event should 
shake the Israeli Government out of its complacency regarding 
the compromises waiting down the road. As long as the argument 
is over Israel's security -- and the subsequent debate about the 
contribution of the settlements -- the mainstream of the U.S. 
Jewish community avoids wars to the last drop of Israeli blood. 
Only a marginal minority challenged the Oslo agreement and 
spoke against concessions on the Golan Heights in exchange for 
peace with Syria. 
  Israel's legal government shoved the handshake with the 
unshaven and kaffiyeh-clad Arab down their throat. It was 
Yitzhaq Rabin, the Six-Day War general, and not the left-wing 
Yosi Beilin who presented them with the fait accompli that the 
dimensions of Greater Israel will not be so great when peace 
comes. Barukh Goldstein, the doctor from Brooklyn, embarrassed 
them and set the ground under the settlements on fire. The 
battle over Jerusalem on the eve of the UNSC resolution put the 
color back in their cheeks. 
  Never before has a group of Jews so insolently exploited its 
political clout to thwart a diplomatic compromise reached by 
Israeli and U.S. Government leaders. They played the role of a 
distinct opposition to Israel's legal government by manipulating 
a political system that has absolutely nothing to do with 
Israel's political or security interests. Most of the 
congressmen who signed the petitions took the name of Jerusalem 
in vain, just to please their Jewish constituents and tycoons. 
Others added their signature yesterday to be able to ask Connie 
Mack or Alfonse D'Amato tomorrow to endorse the initiative 
against a tobacco tax which threatens to ruin the livelihood of 
cigarette manufacturers in their constituencies. 
  As long as the argument was conducted in coordination with 
the Israeli Government, the latter felt at peace with the fact 
that the Jews and the U.S. Congress presented clear limits to 
the administration with regard to Jerusalem. It could do no 
harm to show the Americans that when it comes to concessions on 
Jerusalem, Israel demands a special price. However, the Jewish 
warriors did not make do with an explicit commitment from the 
U.S. President, the vice president, and the secretary of state 
that the refusal to veto the UNSC resolution does not attest to 
an erosion in the administration's position vis-a-vis Jerusalem. 
The worst of the lot, led by Washingtonian pressure groups that 
did not digest the recognition of the PLO, seized on the issue 
of Jerusalem. They took advantage of a Jewish apparatus which 
had been founded by and for Israel to undermine a policy they 
opposed. 
  As far as they were concerned, the chance of a veto that 
would thwart the efforts to heal the wounds of the Hebron 
massacre was an opportunity to save Israel from continuing to 
make concessions to the Arabs. According to them, Jerusalem is 
not just the capital of Israel but "the capital of the Jewish 
people." In a few days, as they do on Passover every year, they 
will declaim "Next Year in Jerusalem" and proceed to check how 
the construction of their villas in Beverly Hills and on Long 
Island is getting along. 
  Seeing that this is not the first and probably not the last 
time that Jerusalem becomes a topic on the agenda of the peace 
process and gets the adrenalin of American Jews racing, we would 
seem to have no other choice but tell them in no uncertain 
terms: Jerusalem is the spiritual and religious capital of the 
Jewish people. Jerusalem is the political capital of the 
citizens of the State of Israel, just like Tel Aviv is their 
financial capital and Washington is the sole capital of the 
citizens of the United States, including the Jews. As long as 
the Israeli Government does not propose to hand over the Western 
Wall to the Muslim Waqf and to ban Jews from visiting the tombs 
of their ancestors on the Mount of Olives, the right of Jews to 
meddle in Israel's affairs is identical to their right to 
interfere in the negotiations about the size of the Palestinian 
police force in Gaza. 
  A capital is first and foremost the manifestation of a 
state's sovereignty. There is no clearer sign of weakness than 
to permit the citizens of a foreign country -- be they Jews, 
Christians, or Muslims -- to dictate to an elected government a 
policy concerning its capital. It is a pity that in his 
appearance at the AIPAC [American Israel Public Affairs 
Committee] convention, the prime minister chose to voice the 
same old tunes they so much like to hear about his struggle for 
a united eternal city instead of telling them that Jerusalem is 
far too important to be a pawn in the hands of wheeler-dealers 
in the diaspora. The Jews of America usually begin fund-raising 
banquets by singing the U.S. and Israeli anthems. For those 
who make do with donating money to Israel, the words "being a 
free people in our land, the land of Zion and Jerusalem" are 
nothing more than lip service.

  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has blamed the absence of 
Arab coordination for the U.S. abstention on the Jerusalem item 
vote that figured in the UN Security Council Resolution 904 on 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. His majesty also faulted the 
Arab handling of the issue and Arab approaches to the draft 
resolution and the Hebron tragedy. His majesty indicated that 
Jerusalem need not have figured in the resolution. Instead a 
reference might have been made to the Geneva Convention, which 
stipulates protection for the Palestinians under occupation. 
  In an interviewed with the French news agency today, his 
majesty said: We may be better off as a result of the 
resolution and the United States abstention, which one may 
interpret as a shift in Washinton's position on Arab demands and 
claims on Jerusalem. [sentence as heard] His Majesty King 
Husayn wondered whether or not this signals a change. He 
indicated that he will call on the United States to spell out 
its stand, since one cannot say for sure that there has been a 
change in the U.S. position. We need to receive assurance that 
the U.S. policy on Jerusalem has not changed as happened in the 
past when Washington viewed the settlements as being illegal to 
begin with and later as an obstacle in the path of the peace 
process. 
  His majesty warned of the detrimental implication of the 
lack 
of Arab coordination for Arab interests, particularly on 
delicate issues and in hard times. He majesty indicated that 
the Arabs have not been able to work out a serious position on a 
comprehensive, just, and lasting settlement acceptable to future 
generations. He said that as things stand now, there is no room 
for optimism because Israel presents a solid, single front and 
we are split into several fronts. 
  His Majesty King Husayn said: We were surprised by the 
wording of the Security Council resolution that was the outcome 
of contacts involving the Palestinians, the Americans, and other 
parties, not including ourselves. His majesty said he tried to 
do the impossible at the eleventh hour before the resolution was 
passed by contacting a number of Arab leaders to achieve a 
semblance of Arab coordination. The aim, his majesty explained, 
was to minimize the chances of a veto or an abstention, 
particularly by the United States. As an occupying power, 
Israel, his majety said, is responsible for a string of crimes, 
including the arson attack at al-Aqsa Mosque in 1969, violations 
of Christian holy places, and the latest al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre. His majesty asked whether Israel has done its duty in 
the way of protection for the sacred places. 
  His majesty said he will travel to the sultanate of Oman 
tomorrow and from there proceed to visit Qatar for consultations 
and coordination with their leaders.

<F P=106> [By Randa Habib] </F>
  [Text] Amman, March 20 (AFP) -- King Husayn of Jordan said 
Sunday [20 March] it was a "mistake" to include references to 
Jerusalem in the UN Security Council resolution condemning the 
Hebron massacre. 
  In an interview with AFP, the king attributed the "mistake" 
to "a total lack of coordination" between Arab countries. 
  "It would have been better not to have mentioned Jerusalem, 
in order to avoid the United States abstaining and the need 
henceforth to ask Washington for guarantees on its position 
regarding the holy city." 
  The Security Council finally adopted Friday a resolution 
condemning the massacre and allowing for international 
protection for the Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied 
territories. 
  In an unusual paragraph-by-paragraph vote, the United States 
abstained on two clauses -- one with a reference to occupied 
Palestinian territory and a second describing Jerusalem as part 
of the occupied territories. 
  King Husayn asked: "Was it really necessary to include 
Jerusalem in this resolution when there was a strong chance that 
the United States would use their vote to veto it, or abstain 
from voting?" 
  He said it would have been better to have evoked the Geneva 
convention on protection for Palestinians in all the territories 
occupied since the 1967 Middle East war. 
  "That would have put the Arabs in a better position," King 
Husayn said. 
  He was also "surprised" that a draft resolution had been 
drawn up between the Palestinians, Americans and other parties 
"following a dialogue in which Jordan did not participate." 
  The king said that only hours before the vote was taken he 
tried to coordinate the Arab position, making telephone calls to 
PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, 
Egyptian President Husni Mubarak and King Hassan of Morocco. 
  King Husayn said he had contacted Washington for 
confirmation 
that its policy on Jerusalem remained unchanged and "will not 
suffer the same fate as that (policy) on settlements, which the 
United States initially regarded as illegal but later described 
as simply an obstacle on the path to peace." 
  East Jerusalem was occupied by Israel in 1967, while it was 
under Jordanian sovereignty, and later annexed. 
  The city is considered holy to Jews, Christians and Moslems, 
and the Moslem holy sites are looked after by the Waqf 
organisation, which is run by the Jordanian religious affairs 
ministry.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Isa al-Shubul] </F>
  [Excerpt] The House of Representatives met yesterday 
evening and listened to a government statement by Talal Sat'an 
al-Hasan, the minister of state for foreign affairs, on UN 
Security Council Resolution No. 904 concerning the settlers' 
recent massacre in the Hebron al-Ibrahimi Mosque and on relevant 
Jordanian moves by His Majesty King Husayn and the government. 
The following is the text of the statement: 
  The Hebron massacre in the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque in the 
blessed month of Ramadan was a violent shock as it resulted in 
the shedding of the blood of innocent worshipers. The massacre 
is a reminder of the danger to which the Palestinian people are 
exposed day and night at the hands of the armed settlers and 
soldiers. The importance of this serious incident stems not 
from the number of people who were killed or wounded en 
masse--people are martyred or wounded on the Palestinian soil 
everyday--but from the cold-blooded manner in which this tragic 
crime was committed and from the identity of this criminal, who 
perpetrated it without any of the pretexts or excuses usually 
advanced by Israel such as self-defense or pursuit of those who 
are allegedly disturbing security. 
  This serious incident drew angry reactions around the world 
and stirred the feelings of those who detest injustice and 
tyranny. It has been proven that arming the settlers on the 
pretext of a threat posed by the Palestinian citizens is merely 
a false allegation; it is the defenseless Palestinian people who 
need security and protection. This painful incident has also 
refuted the possibility of so-called coexistence between the 
Jewish settlers and the Palestinian people on the Palestinian 
territory under the settlers' feeling of ethnic superiority. 
The horrible massacre has proven that the Israeli settlements 
are an obstacle to a just and comprehensive peace. 
  His majesty the king, his government, and all his Jordanian 
people immediately dealt with all political, legal, and human 
aspects of this issue on all levels. Jordan undertook serious 
political activity to obtain a Security Council resolution that 
rises to the level of this event. We worked continuously within 
the United Nations through contacts with the Security Council 
members, the Arab group, and Islamic states. During the 
decisive hours prior to voting on the resolution, his majesty 
the king pursued contacts with his brothers the Arab leaders in 
Morocco, Syria, and Egypt and with President 'Arafat and U.S. 
President Clinton for the sake of adopting a convincing 
resolution and maintaining the phrase related to occupied 
Jerusalem in the resolution. The Foreign Ministry summoned the 
ambassadors of the Security Council permanent member states and 
other member states and emphasized to them Jordan's desire to 
see the resolution adopted in its entirety and unanimously. 
  Resolution 904 provided the required level of positive 
points, foremost being its strong condemnation of the massacre 
and provision of protection and security for the Palestinian 
people in Palestinian territories. It held Israel, in its 
capacity as an occupying force, responsible for security and 
protection in accordance with the Fourth Geneva Convention and 
for disarming settlers. Moreover, the explicit reference to 
Jerusalem as an occupied territory is a positive step toward 
recognizing the Arab and Islamic right to this holy city. 
Obviously, the implementation of this resolution requires 
intensive Arab efforts, cooperation, and follow-up for the sake 
of providing protection and security for the Palestinian people 
against aggression and oppression. 
  There is no need to remind the deputies of the Jordanian 
position on Jerusalem as directed by his majesty the supreme 
commander and of Jordan's insistence on maintaining its 
identity, solemnity, and sanctity; on renovating the holy 
places, the Dome of the Rock, and the al-Aqsa Mosque courtyards; 
on supporting the establishments operating in Jerusalem; on 
returning it to Arab sovereignty; on combating attempts to 
obliterate the Arab and Islamic nature of the holy city; and on 
standing up against the attempts of the so-called Temple 
Faithful to encroach on the al-Aqsa Mosque and holy places. 
  You may also recall that the Declaration of Principles 
signed 
on 13 September 1993 states that negotiations on Jerusalem will 
be conducted in the final and not the transitional phase. 
Therefore, Jordan has actively worked to defend the historical 
and religious sovereignty of Jerusalem so that Israel would not 
exploit the transitional period and continue to change the 
situation in Jerusalem, especially since it has annexed the city 
and considers the eastern and western parts of the city the 
unified capital of Israel even though this annexation was not 
internationally recognized. 
  Several Security Council resolutions have been issued since 
the start of occupation. They dealt with the protection of the 
Palestinian people and held Israel responsible in its capacity 
as the occupation authority. However, these resolutions 
referred to Israel's responsibility in all the occupied Arab 
territories without explicitly mentioning Jerusalem. This means 
the responsibility for protection in Jerusalem was implicitly 
included in the text. Therefore, the United States abstained 
from voting on two paragraphs referring to occupied Jerusalem on 
the pretext that the issue of Jerusalem will be discussed in its 
entirety at the beginning of the third year of the transitional 
phase and that attention is now focusing on the implementation 
of the Declaration of Principles. 
  He added: The resolution as a whole is a good one, both in 
its preamble and its operative paragraphs. The United States' 
abstention from voting on two paragraphs in the preamble on the 
pretext that discussion of the issue of Jerusalem is postponed 
does not undermine the resolution, which was unanimously 
approved by the Council. 
  Hence, the Jordanian move was carefully studied because 
omitting reference to occupied Jerusalem after that lengthy 
debate would result in a problem. Likewise, the failure of the 
resolution through a U.S. veto would be a diplomatic and 
political setback. Consequently, the U.S.'s abstention has not 
blocked the resolution, which is now valid and applicable. 
  You are well aware of the place Jerusalem occupies in King 
Husayn's heart and mind and of what he is always doing for its 
sake. The Jordanian Government's position on the resolution [as 
published] remains as you have always known it; namely, peace 
should be just, permanent, and comprehensive; the occupied Arab 
territories, including Arab Jerusalem, should be regained on the 
basis of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which 
contained other clauses like the rights of refugees and 
evacuees, water, and other issues, and on the basis of land for 
peace; and the Palestinian people's legitimate rights to their 
full national soil should be secured. The issue of Jerusalem is 
one of the most serious and complex issues. We cannot envisage 
peace without restoring full Arab and Islamic rights in the city. 
  The House Foreign Affairs Committee denounced the U.S. 
position during the UN Security Council vote on the resolution 
condemning the ugly Zionist massacre of worshipers at the holy 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque. In a statement issued yesterday, the 
committee denounced the U.S. reservation on two clauses in the 
resolution, the first considered holy Jerusalem part of the 
occupied Arab territories and the second called for securing 
international protection for the Palestinian people in the 
occupied Palestinian territories and demanded that the competent 
quarters do so. 
  The committee voiced its pride in and appreciation for His 
Majesty King Husayn's courageous stand and his initiative in 
contacting the Arab leaders to formulate a united and effective 
position toward what is taking place. It also voiced full 
satisfaction with the position of the 14 Security Council 
members who condemned the massacre and called for providing 
protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied 
territories. 
  The committee chairman and members had earlier yesterday met 
with Talal Sat'an al-Hasan and discussed with him some issues 
related to the important events on the Jordanian and 
international arenas, including Security Council Resolution 904, 
which included the international community's condemnation of the 
holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The minister reviewed the 
Jordanian Government's position toward this resolution and 
explained Jordan's moves before and after the issuance of the 
resolution and its intensive contacts on the Arab and 
international levels. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "News at Ten" program] </F>
  [Text] Members from the Lower House of Parliament voiced 
mixed reactions to the UN Resolution [904]. While recognizing 
the rare unvetoed resolution, they urged the international 
community to ensure the protection of the Palestinians. They 
also voiced concern at Washington's position on Jerusalem. Maha 
al-Sha'ir went to the Parliament and asked some of its members 
about last night's resolution. 
  [Begin recording] ['Abd-al-Hadi al-Majali, Foreign Relations 
Committee chairman] I was really disappointed that the 
resolution took more than three weeks to be adopted and in the 
consultation and negotiation behind the scenes until they 
reached that resolution. The positive, I suppose that this has 
been a resolution which give the Palestinians the right to have 
a protection in the occupied territories, international security 
present to protect the Palestinians and to give them certain 
protection in the occupied territories. The negative thing is 
the position of the United States concerning the Jerusalem 
problem. The massacre itself has proved that Jerusalem is a 
very important issue and the sensitive and important issue 
should be discussed. 
  [Samir Qa'war] You know that Jerusalem is for everybody in 
the world really and it is for the three religions and it has to 
be solved within the context of the peace process negotiations, 
but we hope that the Arab rights in East Jerusalem will be 
realized to be controlled by the Arabs. 
  ['Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Rawabidah] Well, I don't think this is a 
pertinent resolution concerning a massacre of such a magnitude 
and the delay of the resolution which has taken around one 
month. Were it against any other country, it would have taken 
place instantaneously. The United States has been delaying 
taking such a resolution up until it mitigated the massacre 
itself after putting so many pressures on the PLO and on other 
members of the Security Council. Second, it only condemns; it 
didn't take any measures concerning the occupation, concerning 
the protection of the Palestinians. [end recording]

  [Text] The Council of Ministers held a session today under 
Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali. It discussed the UN 
Security Council resolution passed at dawn today on the massacre 
in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  During the session, Dr. al-Majali submitted a report on the 
contacts His Majesty King Husayn had with his brothers, the Arab 
leaders, to stress the need for the UN Security Council 
resolution to contain a clear stipulation on Jerusalem. This is 
because omitting the paragraph on Jerusalem, as some pressures 
sought, would have negatively affected the position and status 
of the holy city. 
  Following the session, Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of 
state 
and information minister, answered questions posed by reporters. 
He said: 
  [Begin recording] [Al-'Anani] The government, represented 
by the Council of Ministers, today studied the Security Council 
resolution passed yesterday in the wake of the bloody massacre 
which occurred in Hebron in Ramadan, corresponding to 25 
February, this year. 
  The government found out that this resolution contained 
positive points, the most important of which are, first, 
condemning the massacre; second, providing protection and 
security to the Palestinian people; and third, focusing on the 
need to protect citizens in accordance with the Fourth Geneva 
Convention, issued in 1949, including occupied Jerusalem. The 
resolution also contained a call for resuming the peace 
negotiations and stressed the need to continue this process and 
immediately implement the Gaza-Jericho First agreement without 
delay. 
  These are the main points which the Council of Ministers 
studied. Moreover, his excellency the prime minister submitted 
to the Council of Ministers a report on the contacts His Majesty 
King Husayn had with his brothers, the Arab leaders, to stress 
the need for this resolution to contain a clear provision on 
Jerusalem. This is because omitting this sentence from the 
resolution, in compliance with some pressures in this direction, 
would have negatively affected the status of this holy city 
which occupies a prominent position among the Arabs and Muslims. 
  Therefore, and following a lengthy discussion of this point, 
the Council of Ministers agreed that the resolution, in general, 
contains positive points that deserve appreciation. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Your Excellency the Minister: In 
light of the vote on the Jerusalem issue, how do you view the 
need for Jordanian and Arab moves on this issue? 
  [Al-'Anani] It is very clear that the declared Israeli 
position on Jerusalem and maintaining that Jerusalem will remain 
Israel's unified capital, according to some statements made by 
Israeli officials, is something which we reject in part and 
parcel. We also regard Jerusalem as an occupied city that has a 
sacred status which no party, such as Israel, should undermine, 
or should threaten through any challenge, occupation, or 
acceptance of the status quo. In our assessment, therefore, the 
U.S. position was taken because the United States had either to 
reject and veto the resolution or abstain. The Americans 
preferred to abstain. 
  However, from now on, we should work together to confront 
the 
Israeli schemes in Jerusalem, especially since there are some 
reports which say that evacuating the settlements in the places 
from which the Israeli Army may withdraw could entail the 
transfer of some settlers to Jerusalem. Hence, action is 
greatly desired on all levels, as are contacts with various 
bodies and states. The Jordanian Government supports, backs, 
and is ready to make, every required effort to explain 
Jerusalem's status and importance and the fact that Jerusalem is 
an occupied land. 
  [Reporter] Your Excellency: Do you view the Security 
Council resolution as sufficient to resume Arab-Israeli 
negotiations? 
  [Al-'Anani] Yes, I believe that the resolution is sufficient 
to resume Arab-Israeli negotiations. Such a decision, however, 
should be made as a result of Arab agreement and coordination 
because the decision to halt or freeze the negotiations 
immediately after the terrible Hebron massacre was made through 
an Arab decision of this kind. [end recording] 
  The Council of Ministers also listened to a report by Talal 
Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs, on His 
Highness Crown Prince Hasan's visit to Croatia and Bosnia- 
Herzegovina. He stressed that the visit was very successful and 
that Jordan seeks a just and comprehensive peace in that region. 
Jordan also supports the agreement reached by the Bosnian 
Muslims and Croats to establish a federation, which the Serbs 
may join, in order to safeguard the aspired peace in that 
region, al-Hasan added. 
  In his report, the minister of state for foreign affairs 
stressed that His Highness Crown Prince Hasan found during his 
meetings with the leaders of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
UN officials appreciation for Jordan's role and humanitarian 
aid, and also for the effective and fine contribution by the 
Jordanian Armed Forces as part of the UN troops.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Jordan will await a consensus among Arab 
parties to Middle East peace negotiations before it takes final 
decision on resuming rounds of bilateral talks in Washington, 
Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani told the JORDAN TIMES 
Saturday [19 March]. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said that the decision to "cut short" 
bilateral 
talks in the U.S. capital in protest after the Feb. 25 massacre 
of Palestinian worshipers in Hebron by an extremist Jewish 
settler was taken within an Arab context and had to be similarly 
reversed. 
  "We need an Arab decision," Dr. al-'Anani said. His comments 
came after a cabinet meeting Saturday during which details of a 
United Nations Security Council resolution condemning the Hebron 
massacre were discussed. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said the Kingdom welcomed the Security 
Council's resolution condemning the massacre but expressed 
reservations over Washington's decision to abstain from voting 
on the part of the resolution that described Arab East Jerusalem 
as Israeli-occupied territory. 
  "We hope that the Israeli statements that Jerusalem is the 
eternal capital of Israel have not received a boost by the 
American vote," said Dr. al-'Anani. 
  He said that Jordan had been made to understand that the 
U.S. 
abstention "was in line with what they said was the terms of the 
Oslo agreement which relegates the negotiations over Jerusalem 
to final status talks." 
  "But our position is that Jerusalem is an occupied territory 
regardless of when its final status is to be negotiated," Dr. 
al-'Anani added, 
  The minister, however, described the resolution, passed late 
Friday after weeks of haggling, as a "good decision." 
  He said that the resolution provided positive stipulations 
protecting the Palestinians in the occupied territories. 
  Dr. al-'Anani added that Jordan "viewed positively" the 
resolution's call for accelerating the peace process and 
reiteration of the applicability of the 1949 Fourth Geneva 
Convention to the territories occupied by Israel in June 1967 
including Jerusalem. 
  A source in Jordan's delegation to the peace talks said an 
announcement by U.S. Ambassador Madeline Albright that Jordan, 
Syria and Lebanon had agreed to resume negotiations with Israel 
in April "is inaccurate." 
  The source, who asked for anonymity, said that Jordan's 
decision to consult with its Arab partners before resuming 
negotiations "does not mean that Jordan will not return" to the 
negotiating table in April as was announced by the U.S. envoy. 
[sentence as published] 
  The Kingdom, along with Syria and Lebanon, "only took a 
decision to cut short a round of bilateral talks between the 
heads of the negotiating teams in Washington in February." The 
three teams left the U.S. capital three days before the 
scheduled end of that round. 
  At the time, Jordanian sources said that the negotiators 
were 
not expected to return to Washington before April mostly to 
accommodate religious holidays of the Muslims and Christians in 
March and early April.

<F P=106> [Interview with Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, in </F>
Amman, by Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in Cairo, date not given; from 
the "Dialogue From Afar" program--recorded] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What is Jordan's impression of and 
stance on the Security Council's resolution denouncing the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre? 
  [Al-'Anani] The Jordanian Government met on Saturday morning 
following the announcement and held an extensive debate on it. 
The government decided that the resolution, Security Council 
Resolution 904, is generally positive, contains some points that 
we regard as positive, and advances the issue it dealt with, 
primarily the protection of the Palestinian people and their 
security on their national soil. 
  We found the clear reference to the occupied Arab 
territories, including Arab Jerusalem, to be positive. We 
believe that the clear and strong denunciation of the massacre 
was one of the positive points. The note on the need for Israel 
to apply the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1945 in all occupied 
Arab territories, including east Jerusalem, was a positive point 
in that resolution. We believe it is now necessary to adopt 
practical measures to translate the resolution into a tangible 
reality, because the Jordanian Government notes with extreme 
concern that the injuries and killings in the occupied Arab land 
since the massacre on 25 February are increasing considerably. 
We must take measures that will guarantee the protection and 
security of the Palestinian people. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] After Security Council Resolution 904 
denouncing the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre was passed, is it now 
certain that the peace process will be resumed? 
  [Al-'Anani] You know the massacre happened while 
consultations were under way among the heads of the delegations 
of the countries participating in the negotiating process. But 
after consultations among themselves, these delegations made a 
collective decision on the need to suspend the negotiations 
until measures are decided following the horrible carnage in 
Hebron. We believe the resolution has contributed to creating a 
favorable atmosphere for resuming negotiations to reach a 
comprehensive, just, and durable solution based on UN 
Resolutions 242 and 338 as well as 425, which concerns Lebanon. 
Jordan believes the road is now open to return to negotiations 
but, as happened before, the decision [to resume talks] must 
come after coordination among the negotiating countries or among 
the foreign ministers of the cordon states that held previous 
meetings in which Egypt participated, represented by its foreign 
minister. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Where does the Jordanian-Israeli track 
stand? 
  [Al-'Anani] The Jordanian-Israeli track of the negotiations 
at the end of the consultations among the delegation heads in 
Washington almost reached the point of formulating some topics 
on the agenda and a detailed subagenda was agreed for 
negotiating these topics. On water, energy, and the 
environment, there was agreement on most of the topics that must 
be discussed in this framework. But security and the borders, 
as some of the key topics on the agenda, on the basis of which 
an agreement will be reached on the mechanism of Israel's 
withdrawal from the Jordanian occupied territories, are not yet 
settled. Besides, the issue of refugees still needs discussion. 
We can say that there is an atmosphere that calls for optimism 
about progress but we cannot say that any (?positive) progress 
has occurred on substantial issues. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What is your [words indistinct] Arab 
coordination, especially with the resumption of the peace 
process in April? 
  [Al-'Anani] Jordan has always believed in the need for full 
Arab coordination to support and continue the peace process 
because Arab coordination unifies Arab stances and precludes 
unilateral measures. Some issues on the agenda on the Arab 
track are interlinked and we want to make sure that the Arab 
stances are harmonious and integrated. 
  We believe the horrible massacre of Hebron has provided 
clear 
evidence that any decision or measure affecting a single track, 
such as the Palestinian-Israeli track, is bound to have obvious 
repercussions and effects on other Arab tracks that would block 
their progress. We believe that Arab coordination 
(?strengthens) Arab stances and prevents unilateral measures and 
competition among Arab tracks at their own expense.

  [Text] Amman -- AL-RA'Y -- His Majesty King Husayn will 
leave for Oman tomorrow, Monday, on the first leg of a tour that 
will take him also to the sisterly State of Qatar. During the 
visit, the king will meet with His Majesty Sultan Qabus 
Bin-Sa'id. On Wednesday [23 March], the king will head for Doha 
on a visit to Qatar to meet with His Highness Shaykh Hamad 
Bin-Khalifah Al Thani. 
  King Husayn will be accompanied, during this tour, by an 
official delegation including Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali, Royal Court Chief al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir, and a 
number of advisers and ministers. 
  Yesterday, the king met with Nasir Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, 
ambassador of the State of Qatar in Amman, and reviewed with him 
the fraternal ties and the current Arab situation. 
  Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said that King Husayn's 
visit to Oman and Qatar comes within the framework of the 
fraternal ties between Jordanian and these two countries. In a 
statement to AL-RA'Y, Dr. al-'Anani said: Jordan has called for 
a review of the nature of inter-Arab relations, which must be 
based on mutual respect, and for restoring these relations apart 
from the impact of the oil era and the misinterpretation of the 
Jordanian stand during the Gulf war. He added that Jordan has 
explained its position many times. 
  Dr. al-'Anani noted that Jordanian-Qatari relations have 
witnessed significant improvement since the Gulf war, adding 
that the joint economic agreement has been renewed and many 
agreements in the fields of education, trade exchange, and 
information have been revived. 
  Regarding relations with Oman, Dr. al-'Anani said that our 
bilateral relations are cordial and fraternal, noting that 
coordination between the two countries has never stopped. 
  The information minister spoke about Jordan's international 
role with regard to its forces taking part in UN peacekeeping 
missions. He said that this role will develop with time due to 
increasing respect for the reputation of these forces because of 
their high efficiency, capability, and discipline. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said the decision to suspend the peace talks 
was made after coordination among the Arab delegations following 
the massacre of the Ibrahimi Mosque. He noted that the massacre 
has spoiled the general atmosphere of the talks and underscored 
basic issues that must be raised before continuing the talks, 
the most important of which is the security of the Palestinians. 
He said that the decision to return to the negotiating table 
will be made after coordination with these states. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said that Jordan has always called for an end 
to the human rights violations perpetrated by Israel against the 
Palestinians, noting that these practices contradict the peace 
process. 
  The information minister reiterated the need for continuous 
consultation between Jordan and the PLO, noting that His Majesty 
King Husayn has always stressed this. He added that the king 
also stressed that consultation and coordination should be held 
within the framework of the peace process itself, not the 
post-peace stages.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "No to the Attempt To Exclude Jerusalem"] </F>
  [Text] Developments in the last hours of the UN Security 
Council's deliberations on the hideous bloody massacre committed 
by Zionist settlers in the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque reflected 
serious attitudes. These attitudes have deviated from the 
principles governing the peace process. It is clear that such 
attitudes seek to circumvent these principles instead of being a 
motive to rectify the course of these principles, which has been 
marred and obstructed by Israeli policies and practices. 
  The reservations--which were expressed only by the United 
States over the term "occupied" in reference to the 
Israeli-occupied territories, including Jerusalem, in return for 
a mere oral condemnation of the terrible massacre--amount to 
blackmail which would grant Israel a false legitimacy regarding 
the status of Jerusalem. These reservations also violate the 
international resolutions which consider this holy city as an 
occupied territory and regard Israel's annexation of Jerusalem 
as null and void and an illegal measure. 
  Stemming from Jordan's realization of both this serious 
situation and the political facts which could result from it 
under the aegis of the UN Security Council, the Jordanian 
leadership and Government have embarked on a high-level 
political move to circumvent the ongoing attempts regarding 
Jerusalem's legal status and cautioning against the dangers 
posed by any resolution which would ignore Jerusalem's legal and 
legitimate status as part of the peace process. This could 
undermine the whole peace process and bring things back to 
square one in the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
  The contacts held between His Majesty King Husayn and 
Presidents al-Asad, Mubarak, and 'Arafat and King Hassan II, as 
well as the summoning by the minister of state for foreign 
affairs of the ambassadors of the five permanent Security 
Council member states and other council members both emanate 
from the bases of the consistent Jordanian position on holy 
Jerusalem. King Husayn asserted that sovereignty over Jerusalem 
will only be that of God, and that Jerusalem will remain a holy 
city which is yearned for by all believers in God from the three 
monotheistic religions. 
  The inclusion in the Security Council resolution of the 
condemnation of the bloody Friday events in the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque and a demand for effective international protection 
measures for the defenseless Palestinian people against the 
oppression of the occupation army and the Zionist extremists and 
terrorists should not mean selling out the Arab character of 
holy Jerusalem or relinquishing this city for the cheap price 
Israel is trying to push under the aegis of the United Nations 
and its Security Council through absolute U.S. support. 
  In view of this serious situation and the great challenge 
posed to one of the holiest Arab and Islamic places, the Arab 
and Islamic nations are now urged to adopt a decisive and 
effective position to confront the usurpation, exclusion, and 
annexation of Jerusalem by the Zionist entity. 
  Stemming from a sensing of the danger and feeling of 
national 
and pan-Arab responsibility, we appeal to the Arab and Islamic 
leaders to rise to the level of this challenge and ignore all 
differences, trifles, and tribal fanaticism, as well as support 
the Jordanian move designed to close ranks, unify the Arab 
position, and champion both Jerusalem and the Palestinian 
people, who are standing fast on their land with unwavering 
faith, thwarting the danger, and paying the tax of blood, souls, 
and jihad, before it is too late.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Serious U.S. Change"] </F>
  [Text] As always, King Husayn has moved quickly to 
formulate an Arab reply to the serious change in the U.S. 
position on the issue of holy Jerusalem. This change surfaced 
during the UN Security Council's deliberations yesterday prior 
to passing a resolution on the Zionist massacre committed in the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque on 25 February. 
  His majesty promptly made contacts with the fraternal Arab 
leaders in Rabat, Damascus, Cairo, and Tunis. He stressed the 
need for an Arab effort to safeguard Palestinian rights and 
thwart the danger posed to holy Jerusalem. He also emphasized 
the importance of coordination among the Arab brothers on issues 
related to the peace process in order to confront the important 
developments of the serious U.S. position on the issue of 
Jerusalem. 
  The serious change in the U.S. Administration's 
position--from considering this holy city as an indivisible part 
of the occupied territories to not considering it as part, and 
quite the most important part, of these territories--would 
threaten the stumbling Arab-Israeli peace process with grave 
failure and would also pave the way for U.S. recognition of 
Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. 
  This change heralds a yet more serious change in the U.S. 
position on the entire peace process, thus turning Washington 
from a cosponsor of the Arab-Israeli peace process to a spade 
designed to totally destroy this process. It would also bring 
the aspired balance in the U.S. Administration's position 
between the two parties to the conflict back to the eras of the 
clear U.S. bias toward Israel. 
  King Husayn has always warned against the dangers posed by a 
collapse in the peace process. It can be learned from his 
majesty's quick move yesterday that he feels the imminent danger 
posed to this process. This requires a fast Arab reply and 
coordination at the highest level. 
  We hope for a quick Arab response to King Husayn's efforts. 
Such a response should be equal to the danger which his majesty 
feels whenever there is an imminent large threat to the Arab 
nation. We hope that this "SOS" will not go unheeded, so we, 
along with all other Arabs, will not regret it. Such regret 
would then be useless.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Security Council Vote Reveals the U.S. </F>
Position"] 
  [Text] After lengthy procrastination and repeated delays, 
the UN Security Council has passed its awaited resolution on the 
massacre of worshipers in the Ibrahimi Mosque, thus opening the 
way for the resumption of the Arab-Israeli negotiations, 
including the bilateral negotiations on implementing the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. 
  Despite some positive points in this resolution, the way 
that 
the United States voted on some of its paragraphs, not to 
mention the U.S. obstruction of the Security Council for 
approximately three weeks, revealed the U.S. Administration's 
true position and confirmed that this U.S. Administration holds 
a greater bias toward Israel than that of former U.S. 
Administrations. 
  The comments made by the U.S. representative at the Security 
Council, after this resolution was passed, are perhaps the 
clearest example of this extreme U.S. bias toward Israel, 
especially since she announced that her country does not regard 
the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Arab Jerusalem as occupied 
territories, so, according to her, they are not covered under 
the Fourth Geneva Convention concerning the situation of 
civilians at wartime. 
  Given this, and in view of this extremely biased U.S. 
position, we do not need to wonder whether Washington is 
entitled to play an honest broker role in the Middle East 
conflict. We do, however, wonder about another doubtful issue: 
Will the new Security Council resolution be implemented on the 
ground, particularly regarding international protection for 
Palestinians, as long as the Clinton administration, which is 
facing a domestic crisis, flatters both Israel and its U.S. 
friends in this manner? 
  While not wishing to focus any more attention on this 
extremely negative U.S. position toward an important aspect of 
the Middle East conflict; namely, Arab Jerusalem, we do hope 
that the recent Security Council resolution will be translated 
into tangible results. We wish to see results that will help 
open the door wide to the resumption of the peace process and 
help make the desired changes in the lives of the citizens in 
the occupied Palestinian territory.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "What Is Left of the International Legitimacy?"] </F>
  [Text] As a new round of Arab-Israeli negotiations will be 
held next month, the question that should be posed is: Will the 
United States sponsor this round on the basis of Resolutions 242 
and 338 or based on Resolution 904, which showed a comprehensive 
reversal of the U.S. position on both Jerusalem and other 
occupied Palestinian territories? 
  The new U.S. position clearly means that the word "First" 
has 
been dropped from the famous Oslo agreement, that there is no 
more room to talk about the post-Gaza-Jericho phase, and that 
Resolution 904 canceled the reported postponement of the 
discussions on Jerusalem and the sovereignty over it. Above 
all, this also means that the televised display that took place 
at the White House on 13 September was sent off to the U.S. 
archives to be stored with other shows labeled: No longer 
suitable for broadcast! 
  The Palestinians, along with other Arabs, have gained a 
condemnation of the Ramadan massacre, which was registered 
against unknown perpetrators. This is because the Security 
Council resolution did not condemn the Zionist enemy or hold it 
responsible for not committing itself to protecting the 
Palestinian citizens in accordance with the Geneva conventions. 
Meanwhile, the Israelis-- in return for accepting the 
condemnation of the massacre, rather than its 
perpetrators--gained recognition of their usurpation of 
Jerusalem and other Palestinian territories, except for the 
small areas of Gaza and Jericho. This humiliating deal raises 
the question: Is it worthwhile for the Arab delegations to 
return to Washington for negotiations, and what issues will be 
discussed after the United States has granted legitimacy to the 
occupation of land? 
  While realizing the bitterness of returning to the 
negotiating table, we should not hesitate to assert that it is 
the Palestinian side that chose to return and that prompted the 
other Arab delegations to do so. When the PLO decides to agree 
on resuming the negotiations, we are confident that the 
Jordanian, Syrian, and Lebanese parties will not have enough 
bargaining chips to continue to boycott the negotiations as an 
expression of their indignation over Resolution 904. It is 
essential here to note that the few months between mid-September 
1993 and mid-March 1994 have placed us all before the fact that 
the peace that Washington and the Zionist enemy are seeking is 
not a just peace, that what is left of the bases of the Madrid 
conference is not worthwhile, and that the Gaza-Jericho First 
agreement has become insignificant since the word "First" was 
dropped and after the enemy clearly pursued policies regarding 
Gaza and Jericho as two new Palestinian camps on Palestinian 
national soil!

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Jerusalem Which They Have Let Down!"] </F>
  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has said that it was a 
mistake and a serious matter to introduce Jerusalem into the 
draft resolution pertaining to the Ramadan massacre in the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque. This introduction resulted in compensating 
the Zionist enemy for an incomplete condemnation of the massacre 
with a new and serious U.S. position on the occupation of 
Jerusalem. Washington abstained on an article of the draft 
resolution that considers Jerusalem as an occupied territory. 
This is a tragic position that needs an open U.S. explanation. 
  His majesty's statements to AFP stressed his disappointment 
and great fears about the shift in the U.S. position. Despite 
all the efforts his majesty made before the vote on the draft 
resolution, the United States maintained its position because 
the Palestinian-U.S. dialogue, which other Arabs did not join, 
led to this devastating result and placed the entire Arab nation 
at a serious turning point concerning the occupation of 
Jerusalem. This requires an explanation by the PLO first, and 
also by other Arabs, particularly those who have always stressed 
their determination to perform prayers in Jerusalem! 
  Resolution 904 is one of the bitter fruits and devastating 
results of the Arab situation. Certain people are eager to 
maintain Arab estrangement and differences. At a time when 
these people are encouraging capitulation to the Zionist enemy 
and giving material and moral bribes to each party that shows 
readiness for this capitulation, we find out that these people 
continue to pay such bribes in order to maintain Arab 
fragmentation, grudges, and weakness. This tempted others into 
destroying us during the Gulf catastrophe, and is now tempting 
them into bringing about further destruction and humiliation. 
  King Husayn's statement was replete with bitterness and 
disappointment. To his majesty and to all genuine Arabs and 
Muslims, Jerusalem is our spiritual capital, so any position 
hostile to its Arab and Islamic character will evoke the king's 
anger and indignation. 
  Resolution 904 was another opportunity for the Arab nation 
to 
identify those who really care for both Jerusalem and every inch 
of our holy places, and also to identify those who do not 
hesitate to sell out both Jerusalem and these holy places. 
Meanwhile, we have not seen or heard a move designed to condemn 
the attempt to legitimatize the occupation of Jerusalem. 
Instead, we have seen people reversing all their bargaining 
chips and standing alongside the enemy, despite the fact that 
the Arabs denied the United States neither funds nor 
subservience, but rather kept serving the United States. 
Naturally, we are referring here to those Arabs who were not 
shocked by the serious U.S. position and who did not make 
efforts to crystallize an Arab or Islamic position that would 
enable us to confront this situation. Moreover, these people 
demonstrated grudges, bad manners, and rancor to their brethren 
whereas they demonstrated love, cordiality, and good treatment 
to the enemy!

  [Text] Cairo, 19 Mar (MENA)--Arab League Assistant 
Secretary General 'Adnan 'Imran voiced hope today that practical 
measures will be taken to provide protection for the occupied 
territories' residents, especially after the UN Security Council 
last night adopted a resolution condemning the 25 February 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron on the West Bank. 
  'Imran said he also hopes that the resolution will mark the 
beginning of a greater UN role in providing for the security 
needs of the occupied Arab territories prior to the transfer of 
these lands to their rightful owners. 
  'Imran, who was speaking on the sidelines of the opening 
session of the second Conference on Solidarity and Cooperation 
in the Mediterranean in the 1990's, remarked: We regret that a 
member of the Security Council abstained on a paragraph that 
affirms respect for the Geneva Conventions, particularly the 
Fourth Convention, which explicitly deals with the world 
community's responsibility for protecting people living under 
occupation from being killed, oppressed, or terrorized. 
  'Imran pointed out that not only are the Israeli settlers 
responsible for the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, but the Israeli 
authorities also are because of the prevailing settler mentality 
and the instructions given to the Israeli Army not to intervene 
to stop any Israeli murderer. He said the Security Council 
resolution on the incident should have been adopted in a more 
timely and urgent manner. 
  The Arab League assistant secretary general asserted that 
Jerusalem is occupied territory according to Security Council 
resolutions. He said this issue must be given priority in the 
peace negotiations. 
  He emphasized that Jerusalem's Arab identity is "beyond 
doubt" and said that all the Arab countries are committed to a 
full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, 
including Jerusalem. 
  'Imran added: More important than resuming the negotiations 
is Israel's abandonment of its procrastination and evasiveness. 
The negotiations will be fruitless unless Israel foregoes its 
rejectionist mentality and complies with international legality. 
  Explaining that the peace issue is a permanent item on the 
Arab League's agenda, he noted that the next Arab foreign 
ministers conference will discuss the Middle East peace process.
