  [Excerpts] President Ilyas al-Hirawi received Robert 
Pelletreau, assistant U.S. secretary of state for Middle East 
affairs, at the Presidential Palace this morning. The following 
is a dispatch from our correspondent at the Presidential Palace: 
  Mr. Pelletreau expected Arab-Israeli negotiations to resume 
toward the end of April. After meeting the president he 
stressed that American support for the Lebanese Government as it 
moves to bolster Lebanese national unity will continue. 
[passage omitted] 
  Earlier, Pelletreau visited Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz. 
[passage omitted] At the end of the meeting, Minister Buwayz 
made the following statement: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Has Mr. 
Pelletreau brought any new positions on the bilateral peace 
negotiations [words indistinct]? 
  [Buwayz] Mr. Pelletreau's visit is part of new American 
efforts to get the peace process moving. It follows various 
consultations with the parties involved in the negotiations. 
The United States is willing to give a new impetus to this 
process. Perhaps this needs additional intensive consultations 
at the level of the U.S. secretary of state. 
  [Correspondent] Have the discussions dealt with the 
explosive 
situation in the south? 
  [Buwayz] Yes. The talks touched on this situation and on 
repeated Israeli aggression, through which, we believe, Israel 
is (?harming) the peace process at the same time it is engaged 
in negotiations. There are also suspicions about internal 
interferences in this regard. 
  [Correspondent] [question indistinct] 
  [Buwayz] There is a climate that effectively means holding 
contacts [words indistinct] officials. I do not think that this 
round has been decided yet. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, did you discuss the continued 
U.S. ban on travel to Lebanon? 
  [Buwayz] I believe that the latest American decision 
includes 
some signs that the American position is changing. These 
include the period [word indistinct] the decision, which is 
shorter than that of earlier decisions, and certain phrases that 
suggest that this period will be used to reconsider the ban. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, it is known that you are 
leaving for Cairo today to attend the Arab League Council 
meeting. The Arab boycott against Israel is on the agenda. 
What do you expect from this? 
  [Buwayz] We believe the boycott was a result of a state of 
war. Lifting it should be a result of a state of peace. Making 
progress at the negotiations and reaching a declaration of 
principles that makes us believe that peace is becoming final 
and real will effectively and legally end the boycott. But 
abolishing the boycott theoretically while the state of war in 
the Middle East continues, I believe, will be only a 
(?theoretical) decision. At any rate, we believe that the 
boycott is a feature of the Arab-Israeli conflict and must be 
discussed within a comprehensive framework for peace. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] the foreign ministers of 
the Arab cordon states in Cairo? 
  [Buwayz] It is customary for the meetings of the cordon 
states to be held independently from other regional or 
international meetings. This, however, does not mean that 
consultations or preparatory meetings in Cairo are not possible. 
But I think that any such meetings will only be in preparation 
for a coordination meeting, which may be held either in Cairo or 
in [words indistinct] independent from the Arab League meeting. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, is it true that Washington 
asked Lebanon to calm the [word indistinct] situation through 
negotiations? 
  [Buwayz] The U.S. policy toward this subject is steady; [?it 
always asks] the Lebanese Government to calm the situation and 
control things in the south. This is nothing new, but there is 
no exceptional interference in [words indistinct] 
  [Correspondent] Do you think the internal security situation 
will affect the negotiating delegation or the Lebanese-Israeli 
negotiations? 
  [Buwayz] Since the beginning of the negotiations, we have 
been eager to secure for the negotiating delegation a sort of 
immunity against all internal changes. I believe this climate 
is necessary for the delegation to continue the negotiations in 
the best way. Anyway, I believe [words indistinct] or negatively 
affect the performance. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, do you share the view that 
the private radio and television newscasts threatened state 
security? 
  [Buwayz] I believe a country like Lebanon, which is living 
in 
the middle of a volcano in this region, cannot continue to have 
a disorganized security, media, and democracy. From this 
perspective, I think that we cannot live in a more easygoing and 
freer atmosphere than in Switzerland, France, or Britain. We 
live in a very turbulent area. Therefore, I believe that 
organizing the media through a clear and frank law will return 
matters to normal and to an acceptable level of freedom and 
democracy commensurate with the internal situation and the 
homeland's security. In any case, I believe this principle is 
not new or exclusive to Lebanon. Freedom, if it is abused, 
hurts others. There is an acceptable level of freedom that 
guarantees the freedom of others, their rights, and the rights 
of the homeland. Therefore, a well-studied law that is based on 
the principle of freedom and democracy -- which are basic in 
Lebanon and are the pillars of this homeland -- and that will 
place controls and checks to ensure that this freedom will not 
become an attack on the homeland will resolve this situation.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Information Minister Michel </F>
Samahah in Beirut by unidentified Radio Monte Carlo reporters in 
the studio--live] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Mr. Michel Samahah, it is feared that 
free expression in Lebanon might be curbed. What can you say in 
this regard to dispel these fears? 
  [Samahah] Nothing in the decision made necessitates fear for 
the media and freedom of expression in Lebanon. Lebanon has its 
own traditions as embodied in its people, heritage, and system. 
Lebanon is a parliamentary democracy. The measure taken is 
temporary and extraordinary. It is dictated by the current 
extraordinary circumstances of our country. This is evident in 
the plotting against the unity of Lebanese territory, the unity 
of the Lebanese people, and the unity of Lebanese institutions. 
Within the framework of the measures taken by the Council of 
Ministers, a media measure was taken regarding only the illegal 
and unlicensed audio and visual sector, pending the issuance of 
the audio and visual media law. The written means of 
expression, i.e., the Lebanese press -- dailies, weeklies, 
monthlies, and periodicals -- continue to exist. They are 
safeguarded by the Lebanese press law. The newspapers are 
issued daily, as normal. All opinions expressing the political 
and trade unionist reality of Lebanese society are being 
published. 
  As for the audio and visual media, the Council of Ministers 
will study and endorse the draft law in its extraordinary 
session on Tuesday [29 March] and then refer it to the Chamber 
of Deputies. I would like to stress here that when the Chamber 
of Deputies receives the government opinion as expressed in its 
draft law, it will make the decision. It will be free to study 
this law, ratify it as it is, or amend it in a manner that 
expresses the opinion of the Lebanese. The people's opinion is 
expressed through the Chamber of Deputies within the framework 
of the democratic parliamentary system. 
  [Reporter] May I say that the al-Hariri government decision 
was not taken to gag mouths or silence every opposition voice, 
and consequently leave the media arena only for the official 
voice? 
  [Samahah] Absolutely, absolutely. Opposition voices do 
exist. They have the opportunity to express themselves on 
Lebanese television, on official Lebanese radio, and in the 
national news agency, starting last night, after the closure of 
all -- sorry, not closure, but suspension of -- the transmission 
of news over radios sand televisions. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, have private audio and visual media 
abided by the ban, especially the dissolved Lebanese Forces [LF] 
news media? 
  [Samahah] All Lebanese audio and visual news media operating 
on Lebanese territory have fully abided by the government 
decision since midnight on 23 March 1994. I had a series of 
meetings with officials in charge of these outlets, the latest 
of which ended two hours ago. We are working together in full 
harmony in order to implement this temporary arrangement, 
pending the ratification of the law regulating audio and visual 
media. 
  [Reporter] Can you say when the new law regulating private 
media will be issued? 
  [Samahah] I cannot anticipate the time the Chamber of 
Deputies will take to study and ratify the law. However, I will 
work from my position so the period will be the shortest 
possible. 
  [Reporter] I would like to refer to the government decision 
to dissolve the LF. Some say it was an attempt by the 
government to liquidate this party. LF Commander Samir Ja'ja' 
said yesterday that three of the suspects accused of the church 
explosion, who belong to the party, have been residing abroad 
for a long time. How were arrest warrants issued against them? 
Can you explain this point? 
  [Samahah] I would like to clarify two points. There is no 
retaliation between the government and the LF. The security and 
political facts gathered on the general situation and the LF 
activities dictated that the Lebanese Government make a 
decision, upon the recommendation of the interior minister. As 
for the judicial aspect, arrest warrants were issued by the 
examining magistrate in this regard. No one can wade into the 
details of this subject before the end of the investigation. We 
should all respect the disengagement of powers between the 
executive and judicial estates. According to Lebanese laws and 
all international investigation laws, it is the examining 
magistrate who, based on available facts and figures, forms a 
judicial conviction, issues arrest warrants, and interrogates 
suspects upon their apprehension, in a legal manner and in the 
presence of a defense lawyer. The examining magistrate will 
then issue an indictment prior to trial. We expect this 
indictment to be issued once the investigation is over. The 
trial will be held publicly in the presence of the defense 
counsel. 
  [Reporter] Do you think the Government of Lebanon's 
adoption of these political, security, and media decisions came 
at the right time, in light of local and regional circumstances? 
  [Samahah] I think it was the right time, otherwise, the 
Lebanese Government would not have made these decisions at this 
time. Consequently, I think if we had not taken, or if we had 
delayed taking, these measures, we would have regretted it and 
our citizens would have accused us of delinquency. 
  [Reporter] In the government statement two days ago, you 
explicitly accused Israel of being behind the explosions in 
Lebanon. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday spoke 
about the resumption of negotiations between the Arabs and 
Israel at the end of next month. Will these accusations have 
any reflections on the negotiations between Israel and Lebanon? 
  [Samahah] The facts available to the Lebanese Government 
from 
the security angle, as well as political information and the 
proceedings of the negotiations, led us to directly accuse 
Israel. We are convinced of this accusation, based on the facts 
available to the Lebanese Government. As for negotiations, 
since the first day of negotiations in Madrid we have been 
sitting and talking to an enemy. We did so in solidarity with 
the Arab brothers. Together, we went to the negotiations, 
proceeding from the principles of Madrid conference. We all 
seek a just and comprehensive peace. Consequently, we will not 
be affected by the ongoing aggression on Lebanon -- land and 
people -- in the south through occupation, shelling, and the 
coercion of our people in the occupied Lebanese strip in 
southern Lebanon and the western al-Biqa'. We will not be 
affected by Israeli moves inside. This means we will continue 
our march toward peace, proceeding from the principles I have 
mentioned, at the negotiating table. Once the judicial 
investigation is over and real incriminations based on facts are 
made of Israeli involvement in explosions in Lebanon and 
[plotting] against the unity of Lebanon, the unity of authority 
in Lebanon, and the unity of people in Lebanon, the Lebanese 
Government, as its statement said, will take a position that 
will demand that the international community and the cosponsors 
of the conference deter Israel and prevent it from continuing 
all these aggressions, whether in occupied south Lebanon and the 
attacks on unoccupied southern Lebanon, or in the explosions and 
criminal hands that plant bombs in places of worship, as 
happened in the case of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq 
[Mikha'il] and the fasting worshipers in it. 
  [Reporter] Your Excellency Lebanese Information Minister 
Michel Samahah, thank you for this direct telephone interview 
from Beirut. Is there anything else you would like to add at the 
end of this interview? 
  [Samahah] I would like to thank Radio Monte Carlo and appeal 
to all friends of Lebanon and all those who care for Lebanon's 
unity, its independence, sovereignty, and independent decision 
to help Lebanon eliminate the Israeli occupation and its 
repercussions for Lebanon's unity and the unity of the 
government in Lebanon. Thank you. 
  [Reporter] Thank you.

<F P=106> [News conference by Information Minister Michel Samahah with </F>
unidentified correspondents in Beirut on 25 March--recorded] 
  [Text] [Samahah] Before anything else, I wish to welcome 
you all. At the beginning of this news conference, before we 
delve into details and issues, I would like to ask you to 
demonstrate your full professionalism at every stage we are 
going through in this country. That is, you need to always 
report the situation or the news item in full. Lebanese and 
Arab brothers in Lebanon who report on Lebanon, as well as the 
foreign correspondents who are here to report on developments, 
we beg of you to take into consideration the fact that this is a 
homeland whose people have suffered a great deal. It deserves 
your full professionalism on the one hand, and your help in 
reporting and commenting on events here on the other hand. You 
should do this to fortify its unity and help it emerge from the 
remnants of past events so that no foreign scheme to return it 
to its previous condition can slip into the country. 
  After that introduction to my meeting with you, I thank you 
for your work and all you are doing. Specifically, I address 
your professional duties in this homeland under these 
circumstances. To start off with -- I would prefer to dedicate 
more time to questions and answers -- but I would like to say 
that the circumstances Lebanon is experiencing and the 
repercussions of all events in the region, in particular the 
negotiations, have caused us to experience security events and 
actions during the recent stages that prompted the cabinet two 
days ago to take the measures that it took. These are 
extraordinary measures because the situation in Lebanon at this 
stage is extraordinary and sensitive. 
  We are not claiming that the situation is dangerous. No. 
But so that the situation does not reach the danger point one 
day, we need to handle extraordinary situations with 
extraordinary measures that bolster the unity of the homeland -- 
land, people, and institutions -- and fortify the Lebanese 
national decision internally and in the negotiations taking 
place in Washington within the framework of the peace talks 
which started in Madrid. 
  I would now like to allow an opportunity for questions and 
answers. 
  [Correspondent] From what I hear you say, I infer that the 
decision to prevent the private media from broadcasting 
newscasts and political programs was demanded by negotiations 
[as heard], in an indirect manner, that is, and that the 
suspension will be for a long time. What can you say about that? 
  [Samahah] This inference is wrong and out of place. To be 
precise, the measure is exceptional and temporary. The Council 
of Ministers linked it to the audiovisual media law, which the 
cabinet will conclude on Tuesday. It will be available to the 
Chamber of Deputies as of Wednesday. It is absolutely not 
connected to negotiations or to what goes on during them. It is 
linked to security and the psychological experience the country 
has undergone. The decision does not condemn audiovisual media 
in Lebanon. This decision is not a condemnation; it prepares 
for the restoration of normalcy in the general atmosphere in the 
country at the sensitive stage we are going through. The future 
of these mass media, their circulation of news and their very 
existence, will depend on the new law. That is why we ordered 
the suspension of newscasts and did not close private radio and 
television stations, out of a desire to respect the 
Constitution, the nature of our people, and our system's 
observation of freedoms. The legalization of audiovisual mass 
media will be achieved through the new law. 
  As explained in the recent cabinet statement, all that is 
happening in Lebanon today -- starting with the negative 
security incidents caused primarily by the heated situation in 
the south as a result of the Israeli occupation of our land and 
our people's resistance of this occupation and also by the 
assault against Lebanon's geographic, human, and personal 
identity as represented by the Sayyidat al-Najat explosion -- is 
linked to our conflict with Israel in its various aspects and 
the ongoing negotiations with Israel. There is evidence in this 
connection. If anyone thinks that negotiations with Israel will 
dictate to us any position on suspending freedoms and preventing 
our people from expressing their views on this issue, this is 
out of the question completely. All freedoms, particularly in 
this field, are protected, not only by government decision or 
action, but by the actual practice of the Chamber of Deputies 
and daily practice. We exempted written media -- newspapers and 
magazines -- which are subject to the publication law. No 
measure, directive, or guidance has been issued to these media. 
  [Correspondent] Your Excellency, the Lebanese Government 
has adopted measures against the media. 
  [Samahah] Not all the media. No measures were adopted 
against the media. An information measure was adopted which 
fully respects and appreciates the role of the private media. 
Our objective behind this measure is to ensure a stronger 
commitment by everyone to the law and to the ongoing efforts to 
boost the national decision and services. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Samahah] I want to speak clearly. Over the past four 
months, many things have happened in Lebanon. These include 
rumors and minor bombings of some holy places and certain 
educational centers and schools. They also include attacks on 
religious sites in several areas and attacks on the cemeteries 
of various sects. Furthermore, leaflets were distributed during 
the night inciting religious sedition, particularly during the 
holiday periods [words indistinct] spiritual families in 
Lebanon. Then came the bombing of the church in Zuq Mikha'il. 
This was followed by rumors. However, the source and motives of 
the rumors were known. [words indistinct]. 
  What the security services and judicial authority have done 
is quite important to our homeland. It is an extraordinary 
measure. The information that was made available when the 
Council of Ministers adopted its decision demonstrated to us 
that Lebanon's unity, the Lebanese legitimate institutions, the 
unity of the Lebanese, and coexistence in Lebanon were the 
targets. 
  This is an extraordinary matter as far as we are concerned. 
What we experienced of events in the sixties, seventies, 
eighties, and early nineties made the government, as a result of 
the facts and information available to it, adopt extraordinary 
measures and stands that it announced after the recent session 
of the Council of Ministers. 
  This, therefore, is not a state of emergency; had it been 
so, we would have simply announced it. This is an extraordinary 
case that could be handled only by the extraordinary decisions 
and measures that the government took to stabilize the 
situation, to bolster the decision, and to protect Lebanon's 
most important foundations: the unity of the land, the 
institutions, and the citizens. The measures were also meant to 
remove the specter of the dark years that our citizens have 
experienced, remove it from their (?daily) life and their 
aspirations for a better future. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] 
  [Samahah] I am not concerned [words indistinct] from all 
private audio, visual, and even printed media. There is no 
discrimination before the law [words indistinct]. All are equal 
before the law. When officials apply this to themselves, they 
become equal to nonofficials and to those who are outside the 
decision centers in the government; both refrain from expressing 
their opinions in their media. This is a national measure taken 
in the context of national decisions at the level of the 
homeland. There was a need to ease the situation, remove the 
tension, and entrench stability. The decision was not meant to 
condemn the media or to evaluate them. Along with the other 
decisions, it was made out of concern for the citizens' 
psychological stability and national immunity. And because this 
is an extraordinary situation and the ban is an extraordinary, 
temporary move, the decision was basically related to the 
application of the Lebanese law, through the law on audio and 
visual media, to the existing media, which will continue to 
exist. This is not a restriction on freedoms, about which we 
are much concerned; this is an extraordinary case to bolster all 
elements of the homeland at a stage in which a new kind of 
confrontation is imposed on us by the Israeli enemy. 
  Regarding the first question -- the deployment of the 
Lebanese Army in Saydun -- I cannot say anything because nothing 
has yet been said officially concerning the dead men. If they 
belonged to the Lebanese Army, then the Army Command will make 
an announcement, and if not, [words indistinct] if the 
resistance carried out an operation against elements 
collaborating with Israel inside our occupied territory and the 
operation succeeded. 
  Regarding the second question, any media establishment on 
Lebanese territory that does not conform to the cabinet's 
decision to stop newscasts and direct or indirect political 
programs will be considered to have violated this decision. If 
that is the case, the necessary measures will be taken against 
it. There can be no vacillation or hesitation in this regard. 
The cabinet's decisions were made to be implemented and there 
can be no bargaining in this respect. 
  There is a special situation in southern Lebanon where the 
citizens are influenced by the media services in the occupied 
Lebanese territory. These citizens are the target of 
psychological warfare waged by the radio of the collaborators 
with Israel [Kafr Killa Voice of the South] and by Israel's 
radio. We are currently studying how to confront this situation 
through Lebanon's state radio and television. The state radio 
reaches several areas and state television covers most parts of 
the south. In the next 24 hours we will boost transmission to 
that area. All this is within the framework of implementing the 
cabinet's decision. No one [word indistinct] in Lebanon has 
violated this decision. 
  [Correspondent] First, do you believe gallows will be set up 
in Beirut [words indistinct]? Second, do you believe the 
investigation [words indistinct]? 
  [Samahah] There is no person in Lebanon, be he Lebanese or 
non-Lebanese, who does not come under the jurisdiction of 
Lebanese law. The Lebanese law is above everyone, regardless of 
his capacity, responsibility, and position. The death sentence 
is the jurisdiction of the Lebanese judiciary. The government 
cannot anticipate the verdicts of the specialized courts on who 
will be sentenced to death or what the sentences will be. The 
Lebanese Government can affirm and I can affirm on behalf of the 
president that if the courts issue death sentences, these 
sentences will be carried out where the crimes took place. If 
the law or the investigation involves big and small fish, there 
are no small and big fish; there are citizens or residents on 
Lebanese territory. If they are convicted, accused, or arrest 
warrants are issued against them, the law will be applied and 
they will be brought to investigation. They will be equally 
treated and their full rights will be safeguarded, such as 
having a defense attorney present during the interrogation and 
to defend them in public trials that are held in accordance with 
the procedures for Lebanese trials. 
  [Correspondent] Could we go back to [words indistinct]? 
  [Samahah] What is the question? 
  [Correspondent] The question is will the fate of [words 
indistinct]? 
  [Samahah] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]? 
  [Samahah] I will start by answering the latter part, because 
the answer to the latter part makes answering the second and 
first parts of the questions easier. All the circumstances that 
have been created in the past in Christian society, or in the 
Christian street as you called it, took various forms to pave 
the way for what was supposed to take place in the Christian 
street as a result of the death of over 100 people in the 
Phalangist Party headquarters explosion and over 100 people in 
the Zuq Mikha'il Church bomb. 
  We heard some voices programmed to make statements at the 
same time as the explosion, on the night it happened and the 
days following it, targeting the unity of Lebanon by calling for 
self-security and federalism. Thus, whoever wanted to frustrate 
the Christian street was planting the seeds through which he 
could reap Lebanon's fragmentation. He was building on the 
frustration and absence of relations with the authorities, the 
regime, and the legitimate institutions that unite the homeland. 
Through this gap, he would then demand international 
protection, to go along with talk we have recently heard about 
requests for international protection, as an after-effect of the 
massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque or the international 
protection that has been demanded for Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Lebanon is a different case altogether. Lebanon is not 
territory occupied by another power as is the case in the 
occupied Arab territories in Palestine which makes the 
Palestinians demand international protection. The same case as 
the Palestinian one also applies to the struggle in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, for one party in the struggle to demand 
international protection from an oppressor party. Lebanon is 
united in its territory and people; there is coexistence among 
the spiritual families. Lebanon is also united in its 
institutions and authorities. Therefore, the objective of all 
attempts that started a long time ago to plant frustration in 
the minds of some people in the Christian street was to move 
from this condition to another condition which would be the 
result of programmed explosions. Reactions to these programmed 
explosions were also programmed to demand the fragmentation of 
the country. 
  Consequently, one cannot be frustrated if one believes in 
the ideals of the spiritual families, believes in the homeland, 
has a democratic political pattern in the political work inside 
the country, and believes in his land. This frustration 
represents an evil desire that seeks to dismember the homeland. 
What is required is that we pass these tests. Thank God, our 
people and their leaders have shown cohesion in confronting the 
aftermath of the church bombing and the Phalangist Party 
headquarters bombing. We must rally more around the state's 
establishments, around the unity of the homeland, and around the 
citizens' unity. 
  I now come to the subject of freedoms, and consequently the 
subject of the television and radio media law. [words 
indistinct] It is natural that this law should take its course 
[words indistinct]. The cabinet has now received this law. At 
its last meeting, the cabinet adopted a decision to discuss this 
law definitively at an extraordinary meeting to be held 
especially for this purpose on Tuesday [29 March]. [words 
indistinct] The decision is that we should study and approve 
this law at a meeting on Tuesday even if the meeting is a long 
one. I hope that even if the meeting takes a long time we will 
be able to finalize it and refer it [to parliament] on 
Wednesday. I am confident that with the new willpower of the 
cabinet [words indistinct] the law will reach the phase of final 
study and final approval at the next meeting. [words indistinct] 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, some newspaper reports claim 
that the United States [words indistinct] knew about the Council 
of Ministers' decision before they were issued [words 
indistinct]. Is this true? 
  [Samahah] This is certainly not true. The way I read this 
report in some newspapers, it was published as though it was a 
confirmed report. In order to make these decisions -- and you 
can testify to what I am saying -- the recent session of the 
Council of Ministers started at 1700 and ended at 2230 in the 
evening. In other words, these decisions were discussed at 
length and in depth. They were decided by the session. No one 
can have prior information before a session begins about 
decisions that are made during that session through a consensus 
of the Council of Ministers and that are formulated during the 
session. Anyone who suggests such an idea, is wrong. The 
Lebanese Government's decisions are made by the Lebanese 
Government itself during its meetings. The Government is not 
affected by any necessity to inform some other party before it 
makes these decisions [words indistinct]. No. Many of the 
decisions were proposed during the [Council of Ministers] 
session and their proposition, discussion, and approval were 
dictated by the facts that were available to the Council of 
Ministers during the session. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] Mr. Minister [words 
indistinct] an attempt to [words indistinct] change the Lebanese 
society, and [words indistinct]. Could one say that the 
measures taken by the Council of Ministers are an attempt to 
[word indistinct] the media [words indistinct]? 
  [Samahah] You are talking about the decisions dealing with 
the media? 
  [Correspondent] Yes, the media and [word indistinct] 
preparing Lebanese society [words indistinct]? Can you comment 
on the [word indistinct] negotiations? 
  [Samahah] The decisions that we have made are not linked in 
any way to the contents of the peace negotiations nor to any 
possible evaluations we might have about the results of these 
negotiations. The decisions we adopted were made as a result of 
the information available to us. They are an indivisible whole. 
The decisions we made concern the media, the political 
situation, security, and a host of issues on handling the 
extraordinary circumstances, situation, and reality the country 
is going through. 
  The temporary nature of the decision regarding the 
audio-visual media is linked to this reality and nothing else. 
It has no background in, or relationship to the results of the 
negotiations on the one hand, nor to the actual contents of the 
law on audio and visual media to be issued. Had we wanted to 
restrict freedoms, or had there been ulterior motives to 
restrict freedoms, the decision would have also included the 
print media and press. Our decision does not include these two 
areas, because they are covered by a separate law, which exists 
within its own framework. The Cabinet decision was made under 
extraordinary circumstances for specific purposes and for a 
limited period of time. I sincerely hope that it will not last 
too long. 
  The law includes the audio and visual media only, for the 
reasons I explained at the beginning of our meeting. There is 
nothing else behind these reasons and they are not linked to the 
negotiations or their results. 
  The country's security situation [words indistinct] 
negotiations. When Israel threatens at the negotiations to 
change the course of these negotiations by disrupting security, 
we should be wary in interpreting this threat and linking it 
with the security incident that targets political 
decision-making through [words indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] some [word indistinct] 
the 
dissolution of the Lebanese Forces Party [words indistinct]? 
  [Samahah] The decision to dissolve the Lebanese Forces Party 
at the Cabinet meeting upon the interior minister's proposal was 
not made merely for judicial considerations. The Cabinet does 
not (?depend) on the judicial authorities' investigation. The 
Cabinet had no knowledge of the investigation and it has no 
access to the investigation before a judge makes an indictment. 
  In its decision, the cabinet relied on security and 
political 
considerations and on a number of incidents and factors in the 
context of its eagerness to enhance the domestic situation. 
  On the other hand, we in the government are concerned with 
Dr. Samir Ja'ja's case as much as we are concerned about any 
Lebanese citizen. As for what Dr. Ja'ja' decides to do, he is 
free to do what he likes. Whether or not he is implicated -- as 
your question might suggest -- this has to be decided by the 
judiciary in light of the evidence they have and the conviction 
of the investigating judge, who alone has the right to act 
according to his convictions. We cannot predict or jump to 
conclusions on this issue. 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] 
  [Samahah] According to the Cabinet's information, we do not 
believe that for four years Lebanon has witnessed such progress 
in consolidating stability and national unity and institutions 
as it has in the past three or four weeks. Besides, no 
conditions as serious and delicate as those which prevailed 
recently have ever existed in Lebanon before. 
  The Cabinet's recent assessment of the general course of 
domestic events required us to adopt this kind of important, 
bold, and extraordinary decisions to protect the unity of the 
land and the people and the country's security and stability, 
all of which was at stake. 
  Our aim was to dispel the fear that held the nation in 
thrall and that was blamed, we were told, on frustration. Bombs 
were planted, leaflets were distributed, places of worship were 
attacked, and rumors were spread, creating an extraordinary 
situation, one which the Cabinet was mindful of when it made its 
decisions at this specific point in time. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] the media that supports 
or 
opposes the Government? 
  [Samahah] Private media cannot be easily classified as 
progovernment or antigovernment. Those who support the 
Government and those who oppose it, as well as those who make up 
their minds as they go all work for various media organs. Means 
of expression are still available in Lebanon. We still have 
newspapers. The press is still free. We still have Lebanese 
Television, Radio Lebanon, and the NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY. 
  The private media, by their very nature, were not in the 
habit of printing all statements in full. Your objection, 
although valid, is not the only consideration that dictates 
everything that should be published. The official media do not 
carry the full statements of the information minister, just the 
highlights. The situation will be dealt with gradually. The 
official media will be as open to the Government as to the 
opposition. They will reflect the country's political life to 
the fullest extent. 
  The measure that has been taken is an extraordinary and 
temporary one, if I may repeat. We are not making excuses. 
This is an extraordinary situation and, whether you are 
Lebanese or foreign, you must be aware of that from the 
experience of the past few weeks, for you have been in close 
touch with events. 
  Extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures. 
These measures will not last for long, because we want the 
situation to go back to normal. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, what is it that is 
frightening you about the radio and television stations? Is 
there something specific [preceding word in English] about what 
these radio and television stations did? You have 50, 60, or 
100 radio and television stations [words indistinct]. What 
precisely frightened you? 
  [Samahah] In what you have watched and heard on those 
television and radio stations, were there not broadcasts that 
largely contributed to the spread of anxiety or sought to 
encourage resentment in the ranks of certain sects or groups, 
thus possibly serving the same aims as the recent bombings? I 
am not saying everyone did this; only some and perhaps only a 
few. After carefully observing these broadcasts, we judged that 
in addition to the positive and helpful atmosphere provided by 
some television and radio stations, some others created certain 
atmospheres that were amenable to Israeli-influenced plans. 
Were these stations doing this innocently or maliciously? In 
view of our exceptional circumstances, it was necessary for us 
to make not only this exceptional decision, but a large number 
of exceptional decisions. Furthermore, we made this decision 
because, for the first time ever, we had uncovered schemes to 
disrupt the country's security; we discovered their planners and 
those who carried out the schemes. We also came into possession 
of security information apart from the data that is purely 
judicial. We acted preemptively in order to protect our 
resolutions during these exceptional circumstances. 
  This will not last long. Soon these audiovisual media will 
be governed by law, as in other countries. I do not wish to 
draw a comparison between Lebanon, in its current circumstances, 
and those very few countries that have no new laws governing the 
media. 
  We must keep in mind that no one else has passed through 20 
dark years as we did. No one else is going through a period of 
domestic recuperation while living in regional circumstances 
like ours and negotiating at the same time. We are not taking 
anyone to task, as I said at the beginning. I am saying exactly 
what I mean. I was careful in choosing my words when I 
discussed the subject. We are not taking anyone to task. The 
measure we implemented was precautionary, not disciplinary. We 
are not trying to suppress these media. Had we wanted to do 
this, we would have closed them down. We simply adopted a 
protective measure, pending the issuance of the media law and 
the results of our ongoing communications with the people in 
charge of those media. 
  [Correspondent] What guarantee is there, Mr. Minister, 
that [words indistinct] the media law for a period [words 
indistinct]? 
  [Samahah] Thank you for that question. The guarantee is the 
Lebanese system. The nature of the Lebanese system and the 
existence of the democratic institutions in the Lebanese system, 
particularly the existence of the Chamber of Deputies, is our 
guarantee that no one will misuse his authority. I think that 
as a minister in the Government I know that the Government does 
not want and will not misuse its authority. If, God forbid, the 
authority has been misused, there is the Chamber of Deputies to 
monitor the misuse of authority. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] the issuance of the law 
by the Council of Ministers on Tuesday? 
  [Samahah] Yes. You arrived late. These questions were 
asked before your arrival. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] the decision to dissolve 
the Lebanese Forces was adopted after the judicial authorities' 
decision. The judicial authorities issued a tentative 
indictment [words indistinct] regarding a certain political 
party, but no measures were adopted against it. Why? 
  [Samahah] The tentative indictment was issued yesterday. A 
Council of Ministers meeting will be held on Tuesday. Wait for 
the Council of Ministers' decisions on Tuesday. 
  [Correspondent] In the wake of the Zuq Mikha'il explosion, 
[words indistinct] arrest warrants were issued [words 
indistinct] the Lebanese Forces. [Words indistinct] involved 
certain areas only? 
  [Samahah] They covered all areas, and successive ... 
  [Correspondent, interrupting] ...did not go beyond a 
specific area? 
  [Samahah] Measures are being adopted in all the Lebanese 
Army's deployment areas. Statements are being issued by the 
Lebanese Army regarding all the confiscations that are taking 
place. There is no discrimination. All Lebanese are equal under 
the law and according to security measures. There is no 
autonomous security in Lebanon. 
  [Correspondent] When will it take up its new (?positions)? 
  [Samahah] It will take its new positions in its present 
deployment areas, in the areas where it has the ability to do 
so, and in the areas where the Syrian Army, which complements 
the Lebanese security forces, is deployed. The same measures 
are being adopted in all Lebanese territory and covers all 
Lebanese citizens. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, my question is about the 
operations area of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon. [Words 
indistinct] the deployment of the Lebanese Army, will it leave 
the area or [words indistinct]? 
  [Samahah] This involves another very careful consideration 
related to the Israeli occupation and the confrontation with 
Israeli occupation. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, did the Council of Ministers 
consider [words indistinct]? 
  [Samahah] These measures have been adopted and will be 
implemented. The Lebanese authorities are working to maintain 
security according to Government policy. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Dispatch by Antoine Kustantin from Beirut] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] This morning, through Radio 
Monte Carlo, Lebanese Information Minister Michel Samahah denied 
yesterday's AL-NAHAR report on the restrictions the minister has 
communicated to the owners of the media organs, including a ban 
on commenting on economic and sports news. Minister Samahah 
said: 
  [Begin recording] [Samahah] First of all, I would like to 
say that I do not like posturing. While the meeting with the 
officials in charge of media organs was under way, I had hoped 
that the source of this report would reveal its identity and say 
what it had to say at the meeting and not outside it. The 
meeting was held in a normal manner at the request of some 
representatives of media organs. The atmopshere was very calm, 
very responsible, and nothing of what one local paper has 
reported took place. The presence of his excellency the 
director of the Public Security Department was natural because 
in the Press and Publications Law, which is currently in force 
in Lebanon, the prerogatives of the Public Security Department 
concerning political censorship are very clear. I wanted his 
excellency the director general to attend this meeting with the 
media officials to prevent any future clamor on the contents of 
the cabinet's decision. The meeting was normal, and the media 
officials who attended showed a sense of responsibility. I 
thank them for their cooperation during and after the meeting. 
  [Kustantin] Your Excellency, it has been said that some 
questions were raised about broadcasting Friday sermons and 
Sunday sermons, and that some Friday sermons have disturbed you? 
  [Samahah] There was no anxiety. There was only complete 
understanding. The banning of broadcasting Friday sermons or 
those delivered during Sunday masses has not been discussed at 
all. What is usually said in these sermons deals with religious 
topics and has nothing to do with politics. Therefore, there is 
absolutely no need for interpretation on this topic. 
  [Kustantin] Your Excellency, two points still need to be 
clarified. The first deals with one of the radio stations which 
you were reportedly asked to ban because it transmits from 
outside Lebanon. Is this true? 
  [Samahah] There is some ambiguity concerning a specific 
radio station which transmits from outside Lebanon, and has... 
  [Kustantin, interrupting] An intermediary office, station in 
Lebanon? 
  [Samahah] An intermediary station in Lebanon. This issue is 
being tackled, and I do not want to discuss it now. We want to 
tackle all issues in a calm manner. 
  [Kustantin] Your Excellency, one last point. It has been 
mentioned that the owners of the media organs have asked you to 
submit a list of what is prohibited and what is allowed and you 
promised to present it at the next meeting, on Wednesday? 
  [Samahah] I reached an understanding with them. I do not 
believe that among us, we need to set lists and limits which can 
be harsh. We agreed on a group of things which have a direct 
bearing on the implementation of the cabinet's decision. They 
abide by this and implement them in a responsible manner. We 
agreed to hold periodic meetings to discuss in detail everything 
to do with the implementation of the decision and the law on 
visual and audio media. 
  [Kustantin] Your Excellency, thank you. [end recording]

  [Text] New York, 25 Mar (INA) -- Iraq has called on the 
United Nations to implement Security Council Resolution 778 
requiring all countries that hold deposits representing proceeds 
from Iraqi oil sales or products, paid in or after August, 1990, 
to transfer these funds from the suspended guarantee account 
[hisab al-daman al-mu'allaq] as laid out in Resolutions 706 and 
712. 
  This came in a letter from Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id 
al-Sahhaf to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  The letter emphasized the need to observe the general rules 
requiring that Iraqi money deposited in the suspended account be 
invested efficiently and that the proceeds be added to the 
principal. 
  Following is the text of the letter: 
  Your Excellency Butrus Butrus-Ghali, 
  UN Secretary General, 
  New York 
  Regarding UN Security Council Resolution 778 of 1992, I 
would 
like to point out the following: 
  1. Paragraph 1 of the said resolution decided that all the 
countries that hold deposits of money for the Iraqi Government 
which represent proceeds of Iraqi oil sales or oil products, 
paid in or after August 1990, must transfer the funds as early 
as possible to the suspended guarantee account, as laid out in 
Resolution 706 and 712 of 1991. 
  Inasmuch as the money put into the Iraqi deposit accounts 
cannot legally come under this heading, since, although it 
represents the proceeds of oil sales, having become part of the 
account it loses this capacity. The money thus becomes Iraqi 
deposits, in view of the fact that the source of the debt 
changed from a sales contract to a bank deposit. Consequently, 
the money does not represent oil sales as stated in the 
resolution. 
  The argument stated above supports Paragraph 2 of the same 
Security Council resolution referring to the proceeds from oil 
sales before they are added to any account. This means the sale 
price must go into the suspended credit account. 
  2. According to banking transaction rules, a suspended 
account owner, in our case the Iraqi Government, does not lose 
it. Accordingly, as the legal proprietor of the account, the 
Iraqi Government's opinion must be taken into consideration in 
all that affects the account. 
  3. It must also be taken into account that the general rules 
require funds deposited in the suspended account to be invested 
efficiently and their proceeds added to the principal. 
  From the above, it is obvious that the provisions of the 
said 
Security Council resolution are illegal; indeed, they flout 
established banking norms that form the foundations of 
international trade. 
  Kindly distribute this letter as a document of the Security 
Council. Regards.

<F P=106> [Report on Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf's </F>
statement on Iraqi Television on 15 March: "Al-Sahhaf: 
Resolution 706 Contains Traps and Snares To Shackle Iraq and To 
Continue Imposing the Blockade; There Is a Treacherous Game in 
Applying the Resolutions Aimed At Avoiding Fulfillment of 
Obligations"] 
  [Text] Iraqi Television last night carried an interview 
with Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf in which he 
reviewed the provisions of the resolutions which were issued by 
the UN Security Council, Iraq's position on them, and the lack 
of any justifications for these resolutions now that Iraq has 
fulfilled its obligations. 
  The minister remarked that this subject needs to be 
explained 
and clarified in detail in view of the conspiracies and intrigue 
which the enemies of Iraq and Arabdom have woven around it. 
  The minister said: Let me begin by pointing out very briefly 
that Resolution (687) was passed on 3 April 1991 after being 
submitted by the henchmen of the imperialist powers. There were 
16 drafts before the resolution was finally put to a vote. Some 
12 member states voted for the resolution. Cuba, which was 
daring and courageous, voted against it. Two other 
non-permanent member states; Ecuador and Yemen, abstained. Some 
member states, such as China and others, gave their vote for the 
resolution, but they also explained their position on it and 
contested some of its provisions. 
  The minister added: The resolution has a preamble and 34 
operative paragraphs. It is a long, complicated resolution and 
its operative paragraphs are purposely divided into 9 sections, 
of which Section (C) is the axis. The leader president had 
dealt with this section in his [13 March] speech. The 
resolution was passed on 3 April, and on 6 April Iraq nofied the 
Security Council of its frank and clear position on it in a 
long, precise message based on the principles of international 
law and the UN Charter. Iraq dealt with all those paragraphs, 
explaining how they conflicted with the principles of 
international law. Iraq concluded its message -- and it is 
important that I mention this -- by citing the words of its then 
Foreign Minister Professor Ahmad Husayn: "While recording these 
principled, legal, and legitimate observations, Iraq appeals to 
men of free conscience among the members of the international 
community and world public opinion to understand the truth as it 
is and to support justice as they should. Iraq has found itself 
faced with one choice only, which is to accept this resolution." 
We then requested that our message be distributed as a document 
of the Security Council, and this was done. 
  The minister added: The purpose was to establish our legal 
and legitimate position which was based on the UN Charter and 
the principles of international law so that our rights would not 
be lost even if we had to accept the resolution under the 
existing circumstances. 
  Al-Sahhaf said: The second remark I would like to make -- 
and this is very important also -- is that on line three of its 
preamble, Resolution (687) affirms the member states' commitment 
to defending Iraq's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and 
political independence. But no sooner had they mentioned this 
sentence than they went about violating it in several paragraphs 
of the same resolution. Several paragraphs conflict with this 
basic principle on which international society is founded. 
  Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf pointed out that he had to make 
this 
remark so people will fully comprehend the unfair general 
blockade which is being imposed on Iraq. The minister said: 
Resolution (661), which was issued on 6 August 1990, explained 
why the unjust blockade was imposed. It was imposed because 
Iraq did not approve Resolution (660) which was issued on 2 
August 1990. What does Resolution (660) say? Resolution (660) 
has two paragraphs providing for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait, 
calling on Iraq and Kuwait to sit together to solve their 
problems, and noting that the Security Council welcomed all 
efforts being exerted, including those of the Arab League, to 
achieve this aim. 
  The minister said: Later, Iraq approved all the resolutions; 
namely, 660, 661, and so forth. Still, the Security Council did 
not fulfill its obligations. So they came and drafted this 
resolution [687], thus "swallowing up" all their previous 
resolutions on the one hand, and producing new conditions and a 
new situation which only exposes the real aims of the whole 
aggression against Iraq. 
  The minister added: Everyone in our society must know how 
matters were twisted at every stage and the purpose behind doing 
so. Resolution (687) has 34 operative paragraphs. The preamble 
refers to Iraq's political independence, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity only as a formality. The preamble also 
includes certain principles which were carefully selected by 
those who drafted the resolution in order to serve as a 
background and a basis for the operative paragraphs which, in 
themselves, are a gross violation of international law and the 
UN Charter in particular. 
  The minister said: The key point of Resolution (687), to 
which the leader president referred in his speech, is Section 
(C). This section includes Paragraphs (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 
13). Paragraph (14) is an explanation saying if Paragraphs 7-13 
are applied successfully to Iraq, it would the beginning of 
their application to the entire Middle East to turn it into a 
zone free of weapons of mass destruction. They have not yet 
done anything on this score. 
  The minister said: Regarding Section (C), which includes the 
paragraphs I just mentioned, they said: We know that you Iraqis 
have weapons of mass destruction. These weapons exist in the 
following fields: the nuclear field, the chemical field, the 
biological field, and the delivery systems field; that is 
missiles. They also said: We have Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 
12, and 13 to apply and we will set up a UN Special Commission 
for that. There is also the International Agency for Atomic 
Energy, which specializes in these matters. The Special 
Commission and the agency have been instructed to work out a 
plan with you. You will tell them the weapons and missiles you 
have. Teams from the Special Commission and the agency will 
come to inspect them, and the existing arsenal will be 
destroyed. We will inspect the sites where you manufactured and 
installed the machines and plants which produce these weapons. 
We will remove parts of these machines so that they would no 
longer be able to produce chemical weapons or missiles with a 
range of more than 150 km. 
  The minister added: They wanted us to reveal all that we had 
and to destroy it. They wanted us to destroy the weapons, which 
were banned under the provisions of this resolution, and also 
the machines and factories connected with their production. 
Once these steps were taken, Iraq would have nothing left and 
would be in no position to produce anything. 
  The minister said: They said: But in order to make sure that 
you Iraqis -- and we know you are a clever and dynamic people -- 
will not go back to producing these weapons, we will set up a 
future monitoring system. They mentioned in Section (C) of 
Resolution (687) that the monitoring system would last for one 
year. 
  The minister said: Since they accepted the resolution, one 
would presume that based their acceptance on the principles of 
law, international relations, and the UN Charter, meaning, 
first, that whatever they requested under Section (C) would not 
prejudice Iraq's national sovereignty and independence, its 
ability for development, and its right to self-determination, 
which are basic for any society and country. We presumed that 
our dealing began on the basis of the provisions and principles 
I mentioned. 
  The minister added: We have been following Section (C) since 
the cease-fire in 1991. The leader president said: Tell us 
what you want so we can sit together, discuss it, and destroy 
some machines and plants to make them unserviceable. And in 
order to reassure everyone we will also set up a monitoring 
system. This has been going on since 1991. We did more than we 
promised. For the sake of precision and to prove to our people, 
I will mention some of the documents which we deposited with the 
United Nations and which are now considered documents of the 
Security Council. They asked us to begin with the nuclear field 
first, and we did. They said we want Iraq to announce its 
commitment to the Nonproliferation Treaty, we said: Fine, we 
have the following: six letters which were sent by the foreign 
minister containing Iraq's adherence to the Treaty on the 
Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, 16 messages and statements 
confirming that Iraq does not possess nuclear weapons and that 
it does not produce these weapons or any substance that goes 
into their production, 62 letters containing Iraqi declarations 
on nuclear positions, and 23 nuclear teams. Then they said: 
Tell us about the components of the Iraqi nuclear program. We 
told them what we had: 547 tonnes of natural uranium [yuraniyum 
tabi'i] and 50 kgs of highly enriched fuel. They took them and 
transported them outside Iraq. We said also that we had 1,850 
kgs of a fairly enriched uranium, 6 kgs of plutonium for 
scientific research, and 6 tonnes of uranium waste. That was 
all. 
  They carried out a thorough inspection. Then, they said: 
We want to know the stages of your nuclear program. So, we 
told them that our stages are as follows: Extraction of uranium 
from ore and its transformation into uranium compounds. We have 
electromagnetics, chemicals, and central [word indistinct]. All 
this is for research. We also process fuels. This framework, 
as you can see, is very normal. We have nuclear reactors we 
bought from you. We have an electro-nuclear power project, 
plants to retrieve depleted (wasted) nuclear fuel, and a plant 
for the treatment of radioactive waste. We have scientific 
research efforts that are connected to the program. Our 
position is the same as that of any other nation or state that 
is conducting research. It is all scientific research for use 
in medicine and agriculture, as part of the development 
programs. Finally, we have agricultural and medical 
applications, to which we have already referred. Of course, we 
have a nuclear safety system, nuclear safety measures, and the 
engineering support for them. 
  The minister said: They saw and thoroughly inspected what we 
had. Talks with [UN chief inspector] Ekeus began in July 1993. 
They continued in September, October, and November of that year, 
and in New York, as well. In his capacity as the representative 
of the International Agency for Atomic Energy, he wrote -- we 
have the document because it is a now Security Council document 
-- saying: There are no more secrets in the Iraqi program. Iraq 
has approved Resolution 715 concerning permanent monitoring. We 
believe Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations. 
  The minister said: Regarding the chemical field, we followed 
the same line. We told them what we have. I will mention some 
figures, because we have them in our records and they are also 
documented with the Security Council. 
  The minister continued: Some 12 large chemical inspection 
teams came, under Paragraph 9 of Section C, to see the records, 
visit the sites, and obtain samples. We detailed our stockpile: 
10,780 pieces of missile hardware ['atad sawarikh] for 122-mm 
missiles, 1,776 shells [qanbarah], 12,634 artillery shells, 30 
al-Husayn missile warheads and 2,000 mortar shells. We said you 
can visit the sites where this hardware is produced, and the 
development laboratories, as well. They inspected them. Then 
they asked: Where are the simple materials [al-mawad 
al-basitah]? We told them that the stockpile of active 
materials [al-mawad al-'awamil] is 280 tonnes, and the simple 
materials stockpile is 75 tonnes. They asked to see the 
canisters. We told them here are 45,000 canisters for 122-mm 
missiles and 5,000 shells for 250-mm missiles, and here are the 
24,000 that were destroyed in the bombing. They were all 
destroyed in the bombing. They saw it all, including the scrap 
metal. Then, they began inspecting. Later, they said: We want 
to see the documents. 
  The minister added: We gave them the nuclear documents, 
which totaled more than 60,000 pages. Then they asked for the 
documents on chemical weapons. We told them they were destroyed 
in the bombing. Then they told us: We want you to remember 
everything and write it down on paper. Iraqi experts exerted 
great efforts and wrote down everything in order to eliminate 
any excuse. Ekeus wrote on a piece of paper: I find this to be 
satisfactory, meeting all requirements. Ekeus then heard the 
statements by the official in charge of the Iraqi and Gulf 
Section in the U.S. State Department and by the U.S. National 
Security Council adviser. He became suspicious after hearing 
these statements, although we had a signed document between us 
in which he said that what he saw was satisfactory and met all 
requirements. 
  When he heard those people speaking in this way, he decided 
that he wanted more information and that what we had given him 
was not enough. Some 12 large chemical teams came. They left 
nothing unearthed. They analyzed water and soil. They carried 
out air inspections. They were very provocative, but the Iraqis 
restrained themselves and remained very patient. The behavior 
of the others was really bad and provocative. 
  The minister said: Iraq did not have anything in the 
biological field. Actually, what we had was just scientific 
research. We did not have any secrets. The so-called 
reinforced microbes [mikrubat mujahhadah] were purchased from 
the United States for purely scientific research, not for 
biochemical weapons. Several experts came and saw them. Then 
they said: We want to see the laboratories, even in those in 
Iraqi universities. They also asked if there were any private 
sector laboratories. 
  Regarding the missiles, we told them: This is what we have. 
Here are the al-Husayn missiles. Here are the Scuds we got from 
the Russians. We gave them details. During this period, they 
brought in 21 teams, if not more, consisting of missile 
specialists. 
  The minister said: The United States continued to play the 
same tune, i.e., that Iraq hid some missiles. So, they launched 
a new search campaign. I call it a search campaign, not an 
inspection campaign. They brought in helicopters and gamma ray 
spectrometers to discover what Iraq might have hidden 
underground. They then toured the country. They stayed for 
several weeks. The American lie was exposed. 
  The minister added: Finally, they asked for the records 
about the disposal of missiles. We gave them the records. Then 
they said: We want to see if these documents are original or 
recent. They brought in a team to inspect the documents. Then 
they said: The documents are original, but we will take them to 
Europe for further inspection by more sensitive instruments, 
although we are sure they are original. We will take them to 
inspect them. We patiently said: Take them. Then we said: 
Fine, we have covered all fields under Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10, 
11, 12, and 13 of Section C. Nothing has been left uninspected. 
  I will now mention how far they have gone in their behavior. 
They said: We want to go to the southern marshlands, because we 
received information about possible leftover chemical weapons 
that were used there. We said: This is very ridiculous. They 
said: Still, we must go. We took them to the south. They wore 
protective suits against chemical weapons. They were flat on 
the ground while helicopters hovered over their heads. They 
located an object stuck into ground. They walked over 
cautiously, tied a rope round it, fearing it might explode. 
When they pulled it out it turned out to be used mortar shell. 
I still remember how some of them shook their heads shamefully, 
and others said: These people -- meaning the Americans -- are 
making a mockery of us. 
  The minister said: We knew right from the start that it was 
an intentional thing. This was one of hundreds, if not 
thousands, of examples that Iraqis have patiently endured since 
1991. 
  The minister added: You may not have heard some of the 
remarks made about the Ministry of Agriculture, which turned out 
to be theatrical, since they did not find any of the things they 
claimed were inside the Ministry. Actually, there was nothing 
in the Ministry. But since they had nothing to say, they wrote 
in their report: We found in one of the rooms "a scratch" on a 
wall caused by a chair. Apparently, the employee using this 
particular chair placed it against the wall, causing the 
scratch. They said in the report: We saw the chair but its 
back was not as high as the scratch. So, it was not the chair 
that caused scratch. This means the chair that made the scratch 
was replaced. They included that in the report as evidence. 
The report was referred to the UN Security Council. You know 
how tense relations were with the Security Council, which wanted 
any justification in order to deceive the world about the 
aggressive threats being made by peoples' hangmen. 
  The minister said: As you can see, I am only citing examples 
and completely avoiding any personal comment. I dealt with this 
person, Ekeus, right from the start. I recall that during our 
meeting together during his last visit here in February 1994, we 
asked him certain specific questions. I asked him: Why this 
delay? What more is asked of us? We explained what we have. 
You also know what we destroyed. I also gave you figures. 
Then they said they wanted whatever we mentioned in writing. 
They said: Actually, we saw the destroyed ammunition, and the 
picture you presented to us was clear, but please remember 
everything and put it down in writing. They wanted us to sit 
down, remember everything, and commit it to writing. We had to 
think and remember what happened in a certain month or a certain 
year, what empty shell, magazine, or simple weapon was used, and 
for what purpose. 
  The minister said: Iraqi technicians sat down and very 
patiently searched their brains so as to eliminate any excuse. 
They produced a full record for Ekeus. He was astonished by 
the results. He said: What you have written down from memory is 
sufficient and meets the purpose. We recorded it in our joint 
minutes. But the Western henchmen said it was not enough. We 
could not accept their haphazard remarks. We told Ekeus: Sit 
down. You said the record was sufficient and met the purpose. 
Therefore, this change in attitude is politically motivated in 
order to prolong the blockade of Iraq. Some Western henchmen 
say this is not enough. To be honest, most members in the 
Security Council are against the extension of the blockade on 
Iraq, because they have begun to see the irrefutable facts. But 
the Americans are known for influencing and blackmailing others, 
and Ekeus knows that. During the last meeting in February 
regarding the monitoring, Gart [name as transliterated] produced 
a chart and reminded me of Resolution 706, which provides for 
exporting oil worth $1.6 billion. The world knows only that oil 
is to be exported. But it does not know the traps and snares 
inherent in this resolution designed to shackle Iraq. All these 
traps and snares are actually intended to make us approve the 
monitoring system details. 
  The minister said: Fine, you have worked out everything. 
Ekeus said: Well, I cannot say that. I said: Fine, why don't 
you find out? You have the Special Commission and the 
experience. You have used everything, including espionage 
aircraft. And now you say you do not know anything. How can 
that be? He said: We do not have the capability. I said: 
Fine, when the Americans wanted to support Iranian claims that 
Iraq used chemical weapons in the Gulf, you made a big uproar. 
A working team was immediately dispatched to the south. Fine, 
let us talk about monitoring. Iraq and its people have been 
very patient with you since 1991. Yet, you now say that you do 
not have the capability. This is unacceptable. We ask you, in 
fact, it is our right -- or, to be more precise, it is our 
minimum right -- to work out a timetable to apply to what 
remains, if you have something new to be monitored. Practically 
speaking, the monitoring began in December 1993, it is in 
progress, and the inspection cameras have been mounted at 
missile sites and nuclear establishments. The inspection teams 
also continue to operate in the factories. They even marked 
some machines with tape, saying they must not be used. Ekeus 
came to us saying: There are machines in some factories that 
must not be used until the monitoring system has been installed. 
So, he produced some tape and stuck it on the machines, 
although they are ordinary commercial machines that the Iraqi 
could have used for months. Tape was stuck on machines, cameras 
were installed in two places, to inspect missile engines and in 
the nuclear sector. Iraqi laboratories are under inspection and 
all the monitoring measures have been taken, yet Ekeus comes and 
says: But our capabilities are limited. This is an obvious 
lie. Its purpose is to waste time and to continue the blockade 
of the Iraqi people. We told Ekeus in February: This is our 
minimum right. We have been patient with you until now. 
  The minister said: We said let us work out a timetable. He 
evaded the subject. We pressed him. We held three meetings 
that continued for hours. But he prevaricated like a fox in the 
forest, as the leader president said. He said: We must have a 
protocol, or a record, for each factory specifying the type of 
monitoring being conducted in it. We should also set up logs. 
Although this was completely unacceptable, we told him: Let it 
be, although we are not 100-percent convinced that you have the 
capability. We know what your capabilities are. We know what 
the Americans have placed at your disposal. We ask you: How 
many Iraqi engineers and experts do you want? Two hundred? 
Take 200. They will help you accomplish your work quickly, 
according to this timetable. As far as we are concerned, we 
believe monitoring began in December 1993. Ekeus said: If I 
agreed to that, they would say I was cooperating with the 
Iraqis. What a weak excuse! So, he completely avoided 
committing himself to a timetable, which is our minimum right. 
  The minister said: The announcement should have been made 
in December 1993. But now that we are in this phase, let us 
respond to the one who brought up the fabrication, although the 
resolution clearly says that once Iraq has fulfilled its 
obligations in these fields there can be nothing left against 
it. It was Ekeus who came up with this prevarication. We do 
not know where he got it from. Monitoring began in December 
1993. The six-month period is a baseless fabrication. The 
resolution itself, as we have heard, spoke of one year. The 
leader president has proved this. The game has become only too 
clear, not just to the politicians, but to any citizen, 
observer, or anyone with an ordinary interest in this subject. 
He can see very clearly that there is a treacherous game that 
goes beyond this resolution. No matter what anyone might say, 
this resolution violates the entire UN Charter and the 
fundamentals of international law. The game has been completely 
exposed. Ekeus wanted to maintain the blockade on Iraq, so he 
looked for any excuse to avoid his obligations. That is quite 
obvious. 
  The minister added: As soon as the inspection teams began 
their work, we should have said that there was nothing left 
unfavorable to our country. But the mean, mean game has 
continued ever since. We have been very patient. I say this 
because we have, indeed, been very patient; in fact, too 
patient, about the enemy's own standards, assumptions, and 
violations of our sovereignty. These people are aggressors who 
resorted to any feeble excuse to implement the resolution their 
way. All these steps could have taken in the spring of 1992, 
but they wanted to continue injuring the Iraqi people, because 
they are the only people who said "no" to the entire 
imperialist-Zionist game. So, they have continued to play the 
fox in the forest to this day. Even now, they insist on what 
they are doing. I will mention some figures. You all recall 
the U.S. spy David Kay. He fabricated a crisis. Therefore, 
they issued Resolution 707, that included several paragraphs 
violating Iraq's sovereignty and independence. I will cite some 
of the provisions in this resolution. The provisions say the 
inspection teams have the right to intercept any car, ship, or 
plane; enter any house or place; storm any building; and 
completely freeze Iraqi rights, even with regard to medicine. 
Even isotopes needed for medicine were withheld from us. Yet, 
they say all Security Council states uphold Iraq's sovereignty, 
territorial integrity, and political independence. 
  The minister continued: They imposed the no-fly zone in the 
South on 28 August. Before that, they imposed the no-fly zone 
in the North. From 28 August to 31 December 1993, the Americans 
violated Iraqi sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political 
independence 25,534 times; that is more than 10 times daily. 
There were days when there were 80 violations. This is in 
addition to dropping flares on fields from low-flying aircraft. 
Thousands of Iraqi women suffered abortions. Several diseases 
were caused. Many people's interests were disrupted. This was 
just during that period. But what did those who imposed this 
situation do? What did those who included in the resolution the 
sentence about member states upholding Iraq's independence, 
territorial integrity, and political independence do? They 
committed scores of violations daily. We have recorded 
everything. They have all been documented with the United 
Nations and even the Arab League. Let us now restrict our 
discussion to the Security Council and Paragraph 22 of 
Resolution 687, which represents the minimum Iraqi rights. As I 
said, the picture now in the Security Council is as follows: 
Those renegades who want continuation of the blockade on the 
Iraqi people are a minority in the council. The majority in the 
council, without mentioning names, call for the need to speed up 
the implementation of Paragraph 22. The majority includes some 
of the permanent members of the UN Security Council. They are 
also a majority within the five big powers; in fact, three of 
the big powers. What is taking place in the Security Council is 
a reflection of the international situation. I believe that to 
a large extent these changes are an expression of an 
international awakening, albeit slowly, to the big plot planned 
in the eighties and carried out against Iraq. The so-called new 
world order was aimed at Iraq and the world. The changes taking 
place in the Security Council are an expression of this 
comparatively slow awakening. We might be able to expedite this 
awakening. 
  The minister added: Tangible changes are definitely taking 
place in the Security Council. The reason is that Iraq has 
fulfilled all its obligations under this resolution, despite its 
unfairness. The so-called new world order has also been 
exposed. Iraqi blood was shed, but the Iraqis remained patient 
all this time. When the evil directed against Iraq began to 
affect others, the changes started. Everyone said: God help 
the Iraqis and give them patience. Yes, when the spark of fire 
began to reach others, they started asking questions: What is 
going on? They could not stand it. What can we say about the 
Iraqis who had to endure this for four years; who were hit by 
the equivalent of seven nuclear bombs? Iraq will soon enter the 
fourth year of the blockade. Indeed, the change has started. 
  The minister said: The leader president, may God preserve 
him, spoke about the nature of the mission of Deputy Prime 
Minister Tariq 'Aziz. I have just spoken about general climate 
of this mission, which is very clear, documented, and founded on 
a basis that any sensible and logical person can understand and 
come to the same conclusion as the leader president, i.e., that 
the game has been exposed and Iraq is only demanding its rights 
under Paragraph 22; rights that should have been applied in the 
spring of 1992. The international situation now -- actually the 
change became evident in the last quarter of 1993 -- is very 
different from what it was on 3 April 1991. The resoluton was 
issued at an inadvertent moment in history, within the game, or 
plot, of the so-called new world order. They tried to establish 
something that conflicted with the nature of things in all parts 
of the world. So, their plans were deadlocked in 1992 and 1993 
and began to be exposed after the last quarter of 1993. 
  The minister explained: The international atmosphere now is 
clearly in favor of Iraqi rights. This inclination exists in 
the Security Council. As I said, the majority in the Security 
Council are demanding implementation of Paragraph 22. Their 
conscience is burdened by the Iraqi people's sufferings as a 
result of this despicable crime committed against them since the 
imposition of the blockade; in fact, since the issuance of 
Resolution 661 on 6 August 1990. The majority is making 
demands. There are divisions in the minority and even inside 
the United States itself. 
  The minister said: Actually, a significant debate took 
place within one of the subcommittees of the Congressional 
Foreign Relations Committee. The debate was between Committee 
Chairman Lee Hamilton, a Democrat and a Clinton supporter, and 
Assistant Secretary of State Pelletreau. The latter was U.S. 
ambassador to Tunisia during the initial contacts with the PLO. 
He was then transferred to the State Department. Pelletreau 
was summoned to testify before the committee. Hamilton himself 
put the questions to Pelletreau. He asked him: Tell me, what 
do you want from Iraq? Pelletreau tried to dodge the question, 
but Hamilton kept coming back with the same question, saying: 
You are not making it clear to me. I want you to say exactly 
what you want from Iraq. What is it that Iraq has not fulfilled 
and must fulfill before the blockade is lifted? Pelletreau 
replied: I believe it will be wise if I do not answer your 
question. The question was repeated ten times, but Pelletreau 
remained evasive. Hamilton then told him: Go now and come back 
after one or two weeks with a written reply. 
  The minister said: This shows that even inside the enemy map 
the atmosphere is no longer the same as the one they fabricated 
and presented in 1991. Yes, the situation is changing and will 
continue to change. We have all seen how world nations changed 
their attitude when spark from the fire that hit Iraq and the 
Iraqi people began reaching them. They stood up and said: This 
is unacceptable. 
  The foreign minister said: Iraqi rights will definitely be 
achieved. The arguments, evidence, and documents we have just 
outlined will silence the largest of them. Who will continue to 
be stubborn once he has been exposed? I believe justice will 
prevail and that Iraqi rights will triumph. No one has been as 
patient as the Iraqi people. No one has withstood such a savage 
onslaught as our people. I believe our people will remain 
steadfast until they hold final victory in their hand and regain 
their rights, God willing. 
  [Badawi] Are there any other implicit conditions set by the 
United States before lifting the blockade on Iraq, even 
partially? Are there conditions related to Iraq's internal 
situation? 
  [Salih] The resolution itself does not include any 
conditions, except those I have just mentioned, i.e., the 
application of the clauses related to Iraq. But outside the 
resolution, there are proposals. Yes, there are proposals, 
including, for example, the issue of human rights and respect 
for human rights. The issue is completely reversed. It is not 
the Government of Iraq that violates human rights. It is the 
U.S. Government and some officials in the United States and 
Britain that violate human rights in Iraq. They are interfering 
in Iraq's domestic affairs in violation of the UN Charter. They 
imposed two no-fly zones on the official forces, apart from the 
Security Council's resolutions. There is no Security Council 
resolution in this regard. These pretexts have become weak. 
These justifications are unfounded. 
  [Badawi] Mr. Sa'di Mahdi Salih, it has been noticed that 
differences surfaced during the recent Security Council debate 
on Iraq, especially among France, Russia, and the PRC on one 
hand and the United State and Britain on the other, and on the 
position to be adopted regarding the assessment of Iraq's 
efforts to handle and respond to the international resolutions. 
The Security Council's members differed. They were unable to 
agree on a statement praising Iraq, for example, for making 
progress regarding disarmament. How do you assess and interpret 
these differences, as well as the French, Russian, and PRC 
positions? 
  [Salih] The facts at present have imposed those differences 
because it is wrong to renew the blockade automatically and 
without any discussion or without considering Iraq's measures to 
implement the relevant Security Council resolutions. Here, any 
objective and fair person will certainly raise his voice and 
call for a pause to discuss the reason why they decide 
automatically, without discussion. Raising such a question will 
lead to differences between the two sides, because some want to 
renew the sanctions without giving convincing reasons and others 
call for discussing and seeing if the reasons that made them 
impose the blockade on Iraq are still there. The answer will 
be: No, none of the reasons are there. Therefore, there will 
be a demand for lifting the blockade. So, the United States and 
Britain are trying to prevent such a trend. 
  [Badawi] There have been Iraqi threats to take some certain 
measure if a settlement was not reached regarding the oil 
embargo on Baghdad, but Tariq 'Aziz did not disclose the nature 
of that measure. What do you mean by a certain measure, 
especially since your demand for lifting the oil embargo was not 
met? 
  [Salih] Let us ask any world state, whose people are placed 
under a comprehensive and firm blockade for four years, what it 
would do when it sees its people dying slowly in a genocide-like 
situation, when its officials and doctors see children dying 
before their eyes without being able to do anything because they 
do not have medicine, and when it sees its people hungry and 
their health affected. What would that state do in such a case? 
It will take measures to protect the people. We should not go 
too far to hint that we will launch a new war. No, we will do 
our utmost to lift that blockade. Our forefathers said: 
Poverty amounts to infidelity. When people starve and are 
naked, they have the right to do everything. 
  If we have managed to restrain our people and prevent them 
from doing things that violate the international will, or can be 
considered a departure from the prevailing concepts, then I 
believe that if our people do something in the future, we will 
not be able to tell to them stop, as we did and continue to do. 
  [Badawi] In other words, is it possible to expect a popular 
Iraqi move? 
  [Salih] I cannot define a certain formula. This might happen 
on the spur of the moment. I cannot now define the formula by 
which we will respond to the injustice our people have suffered. 
However, the wronged have the right to do anything. 
  [Badawi] There is also the question of recognizing Kuwait, 
which was raised again during the debates. Tariq 'Aziz promised 
that if the embargo against Iraq is lifted, then Baghdad might 
reconsider its stand on Kuwait. 
  [Salih] In case the embargo is lifted, then everything can 
be 
discussed. Tariq 'Aziz's answer was clear. I have nothing to 
add to that answer. 
  [Badawi] How can the question of reconsidering the issue of 
Kuwait be interpreted? A final recognition of borders, for 
example? 
  [Salih] Until 2 August 1990, we considered Kuwait a state. 
We dealt with Amir Jabir as a head of state. During his 
meetings with Amir Jabir, President Saddam Husayn dealt with him 
as such. Therefore, when we accepted Resolution 660, I think 
that implicitly meant recognition. But, if we are asked, after 
all that happened to our people, to be lenient to our people's 
enemies -- who insist on harming us -- of course, this puts us 
in an embarrassing position. What will we tell our citizens if 
we keep silent when we see them or their family members die or 
get sick without finding medicine? What will we tell him? What 
will we do? 
  [Badawi] Mr. Sa'di Mahdi Salih, you are taking part in the 
Interparliamentary Union [IPU] meeting in Paris. In accordance 
with an IPU spokesman, a proposal to discuss a request to lift 
the economic sanctions against Iraq has been rejected. In your 
view, does this stand reflect the support of most international 
parliamentarians for the continued sanctions against Baghdad? 
  [Salih] After the disappearance of the role of the former 
Soviet Union, the world now is controlled by a sole superpower, 
the United States. Therefore, all that is prevailing in 
international politics does not reflect the true state of 
affairs. Some fear for their interests, and some even fear 
their own safety. Therefore, the real stands are unclear now. 
Yet, there is broad international sympathy for the Iraqi 
people. This is because the issue is a human issue. Besides, 
the proposal was an extra item. It was not a basic item. 
Therefore, it could be that... 
  [Badawi, interrupting] Yes, but it was rejected. Does this 
reflect a certain orientation, or are your contacts... 
  [Salih, interrupting] No, I do not think it reflects 
reality. 
For the first time, the proposal was put to the vote on the 
first day, while such a thing would usually happen three or four 
days after the opening of the conference. Of course, this seems 
to be a game by the presidency of the conference. 
  [Badawi] The presidency of the conference? 
  [Salih] The traditional presidency of the conference. I do 
not mean the French. The president, I believe, is British. 
  [Badawi] Contacts were recently noted between Baghdad and 
France, Russia, and even Turkey. Turkish President Demirel 
recently called for either toppling the Baghdad regime or 
permitting Ankara to play a role or embark on meditation between 
the Iraqi Government and the Kurds. What is your comment on 
this talk? 
  [Salih] We and Turkey are linked by old and broad relations. 
However, the Iraqi-Turkish relationship was affected by the Gulf 
war. As was the case with several other states, Turkey 
sustained much damage as a result of the blockade. We 
understand what Demirel meant. Demirel meant to say: Enough. 
You are wagering on the possibility that the Iraqi regime will 
fall due to the continued blockade, but this lengthy blockade 
has resulted in nothing to this effect, so you should lift the 
blockade. 
  [Badawi] Mr. Sa'di Mahdi Salih: The Turkish position was 
accompanied by information about Iraqi troop concentrations in 
northern Iraq and a plan to reopen the northern road leading to 
Turkey. Is this true? 
  [Salih] I have no such information. 
  [Badawi] Is there not an intention to reopen the Baghdad- 
Ankara road in order to facilitate exchanges, export, or 
import... 
  [Salih, interrupting] The Baghdad-Ankara road would have 
been open if hadn't been for the Hammer Force and for the U.S. 
and British interference that prevented free movement. This 
road is passable. There are no obstacles on it. 
  [Badawi] But, at present, this road lies in the Kurdish 
region ... 
  [Salih, interrupting] I believe, however, that if there was 
approval of movement, such movement would take place. 
  [Badawi] So, an international green light is awaited. 
  [Salih] Yes, we are awaiting the departure of the Hammer 
Force. It is illegitimate. This force represents flagrant 
interference in the affairs of an independent state and a UN 
member state. 
  [Badawi] Within this context, Mas'ud Barzani has accused the 
Iraqi authorities of taking revenge on the Kurds for the 
extension of the economic embargo on Baghdad by halting fuel 
supplies to the Kurds. 
  [Salih] Iraq is besieged. We told you we suffer much due to 
this blockade, in many forms, including food, medicine, and 
fuel. There is strict rationing of all these materials. The 
Kurds receive their rations. But, if the Kurds compare their 
rations to the pre- war period, the rations will naturally seem 
very small. However, this is the ration Iraq can provide at 
this time. When the blockade of Iraq is lifted, you will find 
that the blockade on the Kurds will consequently and 
simultaneously be lifted. 
  [Badawi] Hence, this measure is linked to ... 
  [Salih, interrupting] It is linked to the main blockade [on 
Iraq]. 
  [Badawi] So, Barzani is right. 
  [Salih] No, he is not right, because he accuses the Iraqi 
Government. But where can the Iraqi Government get additional 
rations? It cannot give to a Kurd twice the ration of an Arab. 
It gives the Kurd the ration mentioned in the ration card. We 
are not responsible for the Kurds' failure to control the 
disbursement and delivery process because we do not have any 
employees there. As a result of the interference in our 
internal affairs, we do not have any authority in that region. 
We deliver the supplies to certain points, and they receive 
them. If they do not deliver the supplies, it is their own 
responsibility. If they sell fuel to Iran for hard currency and 
dispose of fuel as individuals, it is their own responsibility. 
  [Badawi] It is reported that Iraqi oil is being exported to 
Pakistan and Afghanistan via Iran. How true is this? 
  [Salih, laughing] How can oil be exported across borders? 
You know oil is exported in pipelines and requires large 
investments before this can take place. This is not available 
at present. 
  [Badawi] Then, these reports are incorrect. 
  [Salih] Yes, incorrect. 
  [Badawi] Regarding the domestic situation, the opposition is 
talking about the expansion and exacerbation of tension, 
particularly on the security level, in Baghdad and elsewhere in 
Iraq. 
  [Salih] My answer to such utterances is that we welcome 
anyone, even the one who calls himself the opposition, who wants 
to find out or be sure of the true situation. The country is 
opening its doors to all -- to newsmen, politicians, and 
parliamentarians -- to see for themselves in full freedom and to 
become closely acquainted with the situation. I can say in 
advance that they will discover that what they said was wrong 
and does not represent the truth. Security is prevailing all 
over Iraq, except for the area outside state authority, which is 
called the Kurdish area. This area consists of the three 
Governorates of Dahuk, Irbil, and al-Sulaymaniyah. 
  [Badawi] What about the situation in the south? 
  [Salih] The situation in the south is no different from the 
situation in Baghdad. Both are the same. Stability is complete 
and overwhelming. 
  [Badawi] Mr. Sa'di Mahdi Salih: In the aftermath of the 
second Gulf war, promises were made that there would be reforms 
on the political level, toward democracy, pluralism, and so 
forth. Negotiations and dialogues were held with the Kurds. 
Afterward, we heard nothing in this regard. How long will the 
suspension of dialogue between authority and other political 
factions, including the opposition and others, continue? 
  [Salih] We embarked on what you termed political reform at 
the end of the war with Iran. We were expecting to implement 
all that was required by the end of 1990. This included the 
endorsement of a new constitution for the country through a 
referendum and the election of a National Assembly, a Shura 
Council, and the president of the state. These steps were 
expected to be taken at that stage. However, things happened. 
Now, the situation of Iraq is as follows: It is besieged. Part 
of its territory is in one way or another under the control of 
international forces, particularly the United States and 
Britain. Accordingly, these steps are now suspended, but not 
forever. We will implement them as soon as the present 
extraordinary circumstances come to a conclusion. Still, the 
National Assembly discussed and ratified a new party law, which 
is currently valid. Any Iraqis wishing to engage in politics, 
in Iraq or abroad, can apply according to this law. Thus, this 
is a pledge that was not imposed on us but stems from our creed, 
from our conviction that democracy is the right path to run the 
affairs of our country. 
  [Badawi] What about the federation proposal called for by 
the 
opposition factions as a final solution for the Iraqi issue? 
  [Salih] I think there was an answer that was also proposed 
during the dialogue: There is nothing beyond autonomy. We will 
not accept a formula beyond autonomy. We believe this autonomy 
fulfills the aspirations and demands of the Kurdish sons of our 
people. These people enjoyed these rights before their brothers 
in other countries -- Turkey, Syria, and Iran -- did. These 
countries did not give the Kurds what Iraq gave them. But it is 
the game of politics. Iraq wants to build a progressive, 
developed, and cultural system with a sound scientific method. 
Some international powers, however, do not want this. 
Therefore, problems are created. This is one of the problems 
that were first created by Britain and now pursued by the United 
States, to keep Iraq weak and backward. 
  [Badawi] A last word about the future. How do you view it 
from besieged Baghdad? 
  [Salih] The future is for Iraq. The present circumstances 
are extraordinary and temporary. The day will come when the 
world will discover it has wronged Iraq. Many will come to help 
Iraq continue its march because it pursues a sound course. The 
whole question is that we do not want anyone to interfere in our 
internal affairs. Therefore, we respect those who respect us and 
cooperate with them to the end. Iraqi-French relations and the 
previous Iraqi-Soviet relations, and Iraqi-Chinese relations, 
serve as good examples of this. We established good relations, 
even with the United States, but we are very sensitive to any 
interference in our internal affairs. I am sure that future is 
for Iraq. 
  [Badawi] Thank you, Mr. Sa'di Mahdi Salih, speaker of the 
Iraqi National Assembly. 
  [Salih] Thank you.

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Mar (INA)--Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad 
Sa'id al-Sahhaf has said Iraq is being subjected to something 
that has nothing to do with the issue of Kuwait or the 
implementation of UN resolutions. Instead, he said, it is a 
U.S.-led conspiracy with obvious political objectives. 
  Al-Sahhaf was addressing a news conference at Arab League 
headquarters today. It was attended by correspondents of Arab 
and world news agencies, television networks, and the press. 
Al-Sahhaf stressed that Iraq has fully cooperated with the 
United Nations and implemented its resolutions, especially 
Resolution 687. According to the mutual obligations outlined by 
this resolution, especially Paragraph 22, al-Sahhaf noted, the 
United Nations is supposed to unconditionally lift the blockade 
imposed on Iraq. 
  Noting the allegations and charges about the issue of Iraqi 
weapons, al-Sahhaf said: At present, Iraq does not possess any 
banned weapons. Iraq is completely free of the weapons covered 
by Resolution 687. Recalling the UN Special Commission's 
reports and confessions, al-Sahhaf said Iraq cooperated with the 
inspection committees and approved the long-term monitoring 
programs in order to expedite the lifting of the blockade 
imposed on its people. 
  In this regard, Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf pointed out the 
major shift in the positions of many UN Security Council members 
in light of Iraq's great response and major strides in terms of 
commitment to and implementation of UN resolutions. 
  He said the UN Security Council's debates and sanctions 
review during its recent meeting saw a major shift in the 
positions of most of its members in favor of Iraq. He said 
France, China, and Russia -- in addition to nonpermanent member 
states of the UN Security Council, such as Brazil, Rwanda, Oman, 
and Spain -- demand that the blockade be lifted. 
  He expressed extreme regret that international resolutions 
continue to be drafted under U.S. influence, and that the U.S. 
Administration continues to besiege Iraq despite the 
far-reaching effects on society's public health, especially 
among children and women. He said that under U.S. influence, 
the Security Council has decided to maintain the sanctions, 
something intended to humiliate and annihilate the Iraqi people. 
  The foreign minister drew the attention of public opinion 
and the international community to the depth and seriousness of 
the crime perpetrated against the Iraqi people. He said the 
continuing freeze on Iraqi assets at Western banks and 
establishments robbed Iraq of the opportunity to employ the 
international resolution to use these assets to import food and 
medicine. 
  The minister stressed the fact that this reflects the 
illegal 
criminal and hostile campaign of annihilation waged against Iraq 
by well-known international powers. This has no precedence in 
history. He said: Reports by international bodies, the World 
Health Organization, and UNICEF clearly point out the crimes 
perpetrated against Iraq. 
  The minister refuted the Kuwaiti regime's lies and its 
claims 
about so-called missing Kuwaitis. He reemphasized that there 
are no Kuwaitis in Iraq. He said: Iraq has cooperated in a 
positive way with the Red Cross and the Arab League about this 
issue. 
  The foreign minister accused the al-Sabah family of 
continuing to exploit the aggressive U.S. position, instigating 
public opinion against Iraq, and preventing the lifting of the 
embargo against the Iraqi people by creating the lie about 
missing Kuwaitis. 
  Reinforcing his argument, al-Sahhaf said: The Kuwaiti regime 
has not responded to or agreed with all the Arab initiatives, 
including Gulf initiatives, intended to close the book on these 
allegations used to injure Iraq. 
  Focusing on relations between Iraq and the Gulf states, 
al-Sahhaf said: We follow a constant policy based on principles 
of promoting cooperation and activating ties with Arab countries 
. He stressed Iraq's permanent readiness to sincerely cooperate 
with the Arab group to serve Arab causes. He said: We now have 
good relations with Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and other brothers. 
  Touching on the issue of Arab reconciliation, al-Sahhaf 
said: 
Iraq supports every Arab effort to effect solidarity. He said 
such efforts and intentions should be based on the principle of 
preserving pan-Arab security and confronting threats directed at 
Iraq and the Arab nation, indicating in this regard Iraq's 
previous positions on this issue, particularly the pan-Arab 
declaration of President Saddam Husayn in August 1980. 
  Warning the Arab nation against the gravity of the 
U.S.-Zionist scheme against it, al-Sahhaf said: Those 
intentions are not aimed just against Iraq. Rather, the 
imperialist-Zionist scheme targets all Arab countries and seeks 
to incite direct and indirect problems in them. 
  The minister shed light on the aggressive U.S. practices 
designed to dismantle Iraq and harm its national sovereignty. 
He said the air exclusion zones in southern and northern Iraq 
are nothing but a U.S. plot, drafted in the form of a 
resolution, that contravenes UN Security Council resolutions. 
This has been admitted by UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, he noted. 
  He explained that from the time the no-fly zone was imposed 
in southern Iraq to the end of last year, U.S. and British 
aircraft carried out over 25,535 violations of Iraqi airspace in 
the south, using bases and facilities provided by the Saudi and 
Kuwaiti regimes. 
  Touching on imperialist-Zionist interference in northern 
Iraq, Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said the central government had 
been about to sign an agreement with Kurdish parties to promote 
self-rule. However, the U.S. Administration, as acknowledged by 
Barzani, prevented those parties from signing the agreement, 
which was in the interest of the Kurds of Iraq in the first 
place. 
  Al-Sahhaf accused Washington, Tel Aviv, and Arab parties, 
including the al-Sabah family, of conspiring against Iraq and 
supporting some gangs in northern Iraq in order to ensure the 
continuation of the abnormal situation there and to partition 
Iraq. He stressed that Iraqis are aware of the objectives of 
these schemes, and are very prepared to confront them. 
  The minister described the domestic situation in Iraq as 
very 
excellent. He said rumors propagated against Iraq are nothing 
but exposed and explicit propaganda campaigns pushed by the 
United States and other hostile parties.

  [Text] A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said the 
signing of agreements between Iraq and two French oil companies 
is a matter that only concerns the two companies. 
  Commenting on contacts between Iraq and the French companies 
last Friday, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told a news 
conference that he would like to have a list of companies from 
other countries that have the same contacts with the Iraqi 
Government--a reference to the U.S., British, and other Western 
companies. 
  Minister of Oil Safa' Hadi Jawad emphasized in a statement, 
published in AL-QADISIYAH last Saturday, that several major 
international oil companies have shown a strong desire to sign 
contracts with Iraq. 
  He said negotiations with French oil companies in Paris 
resulted in agreements that will be implemented after the siege 
is lifted.

  [Text] Baghdad, 26 Mar (INA)--Oil Minister Dr. Safa' Hadi 
Jawad has said that a number of leading U.S., Canadian, British, 
Brazilian, and Spanish oil companies have expressed a strong 
desire to conclude contracts with Iraq and to cooperate with it 
in the field of oil production. 
  In an interview with the newspaper AL-QADISIYAH published 
here today, the minister said that these international 
companies, which play a great and effective role in their 
countries' governments, seek to reemploy their expertise and 
investments in our oil industry despite the continuation of the 
blockade imposed on Iraq. 
  He said that there is another group of oil companies that 
seek to improve and promote their relations with Iraq, and that 
they seek to seize the appropriate opportunity to hold contacts 
and talks with Iraq in order to reach a specific agreement or to 
conclude contracts to develop their investments after the 
blockade is lifted. 
  The oil minister said: Negotiations with the international 
oil companies have taken place not only in Baghdad, but also in 
other world capitals, including Amman and Vienna. He stressed 
that the negotiations with the French oil companies, which were 
recently held in Paris, resulted in agreements that will be 
implemented after the blockade is lifted. 
  He emphasized that the continuation of the blockade not only 
affects Iraq and its people, but it is now affecting the 
neighboring states and other states with interests in Iraq. 
These states have begun to feel the grave damage inflicted on 
their economies. He added that Turkey is now suffering from a 
serious economic crisis after the stoppage of the Iraqi-Turkish 
pipeline, and after banning the crude oil exports through this 
line to Turkey and then to other ports. He said that 
reoperating this line will secure jobs for thousands of Turkish 
workers. 
  Oil Minister Safa' Hadi Jawad added: The closure of the 
Iraqi- Turkish oil pipeline has led to the deterioration of the 
economic situation in the Anatolia region and the Turkish ports, 
to the growth of unemployment rates, and to the deterioration of 
the security situation in the region. 
  He noted: As a result of these problems and obstacles, 
Turkey began to pressure the UN Security Council to allow the 
reopening of the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline, which will reactivate 
trade between the two countries using 1,000 trucks per day to 
transport goods. 
  The oil minister pointed out that Iraq's current production 
of crude oil falls within the limits of 550,000-600,000 barrels 
per day to meet the local needs for oil byproducts. He said 
that important explorations have been undertaken in the central 
and western regions of Iraq, and that previously-discovered oil 
fields have also been developed.

  [Text] Tehran, March 27, IRNA -- Loss of floppy diskettes 
containing vital classified information has terrified the Iraqi 
regime, according to radio 'Voice of the Iraqi People', 
monitored here today. 
  The radio said Iraq security forces have started inspecting 
houses of hundreds of persons suspected of removing the 
diskettes, and have arrested a number of employees of related 
departments. 
  It has not yet been clarified what data the diskettes 
contained, but the way the Iraqi regime is treating the 
suspects, the radio said it is likely that they might contain 
vital security information. 
  What's more concerning for the regime is that foreign 
embassies in Baghdad can get access to the diskettes. 
  The radio added that broadcast of the classified information 
contained in the diskettes by internationl radio stations might 
also be critical for the Iraqi regime. 
  Voice of the Iraqi People is an opposition radio operating 
from somewhere inside Iraq. It did not give further details.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ahmad al-Jalabi, president of the Executive </F>
Council of the opposition Iraqi National Conference by Salim 
Badawi; date and place not given; from "The Event" 
program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Jalabi] With Saddam still in office, the 
sanctions cannot be lifted. Relief for the Iraqi people lies in 
the implementation of Resolutions 706 and 712. The 
international community has no confidence in the Iraqi regime or 
its compliance with resolutions. 
  [Badawi] Don't you agree, though, that the only party being 
hurt is the Iraqi people, of which you are a part, rather than 
the regime? Do you continue to hold that retaining the 
sanctions will topple the regime? 
  [Al-Jalabi] The Iraqi people will not benefit from lifting 
the sanctions. The regime will use the ensuing income to 
purchase weapons and new tools of repression. Only the regime 
will benefit from lifting the sanctions. 
  [Badawi] There has been a relative and limited shift in the 
positions of certain major powers like France and Russia toward 
the Baghdad regime. How do you feel about that? 
  [Al-Jalabi] France and Russia seem to be misreading the 
situation. Russia seems to think that scrapping the sanctions 
will bring in money Iraq can use to pay the huge military debt 
it owes Moscow. As for France, important commercial interests 
there want drilling concessions in the Majnun oil field. These 
interests think extending support to Saddam at this point will 
help him survive, and then they will be in a position to clinch 
the oil drilling contracts. They are influencing their 
government. We think their influence is extremely limited. 
  [Badawi] If the Iraqi regime can capitalize on some positive 
shifts by certain world powers, you, as an opposition, will 
benefit as well. There are reports you receive financial 
support from abroad, especially from regional powers opposed to 
the Iraqi regime. Don't you think such an attitude makes you 
less credible as a patriotic opposition? 
  [Al-Jalabi] Saddam [words indistinct] and destroyed the 
Iraqi people's independent movement. We set up offices and we 
are working from inside Iraq. We have moved the opposition from 
exile onto Iraqi territory, where we are engaged in real, 
democratic, and open political action. We believe our 
credibility with the Iraqi people is strong. As for the reports 
about financial backing, I have no comment, you are not being 
specific. 
  [Badawi] In light of the present situation in Iraq, how do 
you see the country's political landscape developing? 
  [Al-Jalabi] The Iraqi regime is now progressively losing all 
the requirements of a proper state. The regime is abdicating 
state functions, like securing food, protection and safety for 
the population. Thefts are rife, as are murders. The regime is 
doing nothing about them. The regime is growing weaker and 
weaker, and the people are poised to pounce on it. We are now 
mobilizing our resources to promote that end. 
  [Badawi] Thank you, Mr. al-Jalabi. 
  [Al-Jalabi] Thank you.

  [Text] According to reports received from special sources, 
the chauvinistic Baghdad regime deployed a military division 
inside Karkuk on 18 and 19 March, fearing an explosion of 
popular outrage in the city, especially during the days 
commemorating the anniversary of the liberation of this beloved 
Kurdish city and the Nowruz celebrations. 
  In their patrols of the streets and alleys of Karkuk, the 
regime's discipline men stand fully prepared and [words 
indistinct] to suppress any popular move in the city. The 
regime troops also searched the shops of Kurds in the city and 
caused many troubles for their owners.

  [Text] Cairo, 28 Mar (INA)--Iraq has informed the Arab 
League that the rulers of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait continued to 
offer facilities to U.S., British, and French aircraft to 
violate Iraqi airspace, noting that this seriously jeopardizes 
Iraq's security, sovereignty, and national unity. 
  In a message addressed to the league's secretary general, 
the 
Iraqi permanent representative to the Arab League said these 
aircraft carried out 321 hostile air sorties, flying from bases 
in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on 17-24 March. 
  A list attached to the letter detailed the airspace 
violations.

  [Text] Zakho, Iraq, March 27, (AFP) -- Two Austrian UN 
guards were wounded, one of them seriously, when gunmen ambushed 
a bus they were travelling in Sunday [27 March] near Irbil in 
Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, UN sources said. 
  The United Nations was trying to evacuate the wounded 
guards, 
said the officials in Zakho near the Turkish border. 
  The Austrians were in a bus taking 22 UN guards from Irbil 
to 
Baghdad at the end of their tour of duty. The guards are 
employed to protect UN personnel and vehicles. 
  UN organisations have been working in the Kurdish-controlled 
region of northern Iraq since the Kurdish uprising against 
Baghdad which followed the January-February 1991 Gulf war. 
  Since 1992 UN personnel and offices in the region have been 
repeatedly attacked. 
  The Kurdish authorities blamed agents of the Iraqi 
government. 
  Baghdad has warned several times that it will not tolerate 
foreigners carrying out humanitarian work in the north of the 
country. 
  There have been 11 attacks this year, nine against the UN, 
one against a German humanitarian organisation and one against 
Swedish journalists, the UN's Inter-Agency Relief Coordination 
Unit reported. It said six people were injured but none killed.

  [Text] Baghdad, 26 Mar (INA)--The newspaper AL-'IRAQ has 
denounced U.S. President Bill Clinton's recent statements in 
which he announced before the leaders of Jewish organizations in 
the United States that he and his government consider Jerusalem 
as the united capital of the Zionist entity. 
  In an article today, the paper notes: During his election 
campaign, Clinton competed with his predecessor George Bush to 
win Zionist votes by pledging never to forsake the Zionist 
entity. 
  The paper points out that this pledge included Clinton's 
readiness to support the Zionist entity by giving it loans and 
grants to finance the establishment of settlements in the 
occupied West Bank, and assurances that the Zionists will not 
find a better friend at times of war or peace. 
  The paper reviews some of Clinton's actions after he won the 
presidential elections. The most important of these actions are 
his disavowal of the statement in which he expressed his 
readiness to turn over a new leaf in relations with Iraq if Iraq 
complied with the UN Security Council resolutions, his missile 
attack on Baghdad, and the current scandals in which he and his 
family are involved. 
  The paper notes that the campaign against Clinton's 
reputation by the Republicans and certain Zionists is due to the 
fact that these circles are not satisfied with the White House 
President merely announcing openly that he supports the Zionist 
entity, they want him to prove, through words and deeds, that he 
will pursue this course, and show that any deviation from this 
course will result in blackmailing and exposing him, making him 
a lesson to others.

  [Text] The G-15 countries have favored transregional 
arrangements to promote cooperation in trade, investment, and 
technology. The matter came up for extensive discussion at the 
meeting of personnel representatives of the heads of government 
and state of the group in New Delhi today. Briefing newsmen 
later, the spokesman of the G-15 summit said the representatives 
will come up with concrete proposals to promote this in both the 
private and public sectors. They felt that this will increase 
exchanges among them. With the group having a combined trade 
turnover of over $400 billion a year and a GDP of $1.4 trillion, 
the arrangement will improve their economic strength 
individually and collectively. 
  The preparatory meeting for the New Delhi G-15 summit -- 
beginning on Monday [28 March] -- considered substantive issues, 
including the summit agenda, draft joint communique, future 
organization of the work and activities of the group, and 
proposals for new projects. The major agreement among them was 
to take up issue-based consultations with the G-7 group of 
industrialized countries a practical and result-oriented 
approach. [sentence as heard] They stressed the importance of 
continuing post-Uruguay Round consultations. Another suggestion 
was that the foreign ministers of the group should have a more 
comprehensive role to carry on the work effectively between the 
summit meetings. Procedural aspects -- including the quorum 
issue, frequency of summit meetings, and predetermined period 
for holding the summit -- also came up for review. The 
representatives will continue their consultations tomorrow 
morning. 
  The troika foreign ministers of G-15 -- India, Argentina, 
and 
Senegal -- will also have simultaneous meetings on the summit 
agenda. 
  AIR [All India Radio] correspondent reports that New Delhi 
is 
spruced up to welcome the heads of government and state of the 
G-15 countries, who will be given a ceremonial welcome in the 
capital on Sunday. Seven or eight heads of state and government 
are expected to attend the summit.

<F P=106> [Statement by "official Palestinian spokesman;" place and </F>
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] Once again some Arab brothers have tried to 
cause confusion regarding the issue of Jerusalem during UN 
Security Council debates on Resolution 904. This resolution was 
adopted to condemn the massacre in the sacred al-Ibrahim Mosque 
in Hebron, and to take important measures, for the first time, 
on this significant international level. Especially important 
is the comprehensive aspect of this resolution, which is binding 
on all members of the international community. In relation to 
holy Jerusalem, the resolution deals with it as an integral part 
of the Palestinian territories that have been occupied since 
June 1967. 
  The clarification supplied by the U.S. Government on the 
paragraph concerned prompted the Islamic and Arab groups to 
begin activities in New York and Washington to immediately take 
up the issue with the U.S. Administration. The administration 
has recently clarified its position, and despite feverish 
attempts by the Jewish lobby in the United States, the final 
status of Jerusalem will be discussed within a period not 
exceeding two years from this date. 
  Holy Jerusalem is the capital of the state of Palestine; 
therefore, we stress our total belief in our right, religion, 
and holy Koran [passage omitted]. Jerusalem is an integral part 
of Palestinian national sovereignty; God Almighty has honored us 
by making us its loyal guardians; we defend it with our lives 
and with the cascades of blood that have not ceased to flow for 
one single minute along the path of the Palestinian and Arab 
holy war to defend the two holy places -- sacred places of 
Prophet Muhammad, God's peace and prayers be upon him, and Jesus 
Christ, God's peace upon him. 
  Stemming from this principle, we will not accept any Israeli 
or non-Israeli control over Jerusalem, because it is the capital 
of our independent state of Palestine. [passage omitted].

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Mar (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General 
Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has demanded that Israeli settlers in 
the occupied Arab territories be completely disarmed and that 
all settlements in these territories be dismantled and removed 
in line with UN Security Council Resolution 465. 
  In his speech to the opening session of the Arab League 
Council's conference, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid stressed that Israel 
must implement the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, 
particularly in connection with protecting people living under 
occupation. He urged that an effective international presence 
be expeditiously established in the occupied territories. He 
declared that the Arab countries are committed to a 
comprehensive and just peace in line with UN and Arab 
resolutions. 
  'Abd-al-Majid said that Israeli procrastinations and inhuman 
practices have encouraged the settlers' criminal propensities, 
resulted in greater violence, and created real obstacles to the 
peace process, which, he noted, cannot continue unless the 
minimal conditions for restoring trust are met and Israel stops 
evading its commitments. 
  He announced that the Arab group at the United Nations has 
decided to form a troika representing the Arab ambassadors to 
the United Nations and the heads of the Arab group for the 
months of February, March, and April. This troika, he said, 
will hold a meeting with the U.S. permanent delegate to the 
United Nations. The Arab group also instructed the Egyptian 
delegation to prepare a draft message on behalf of all Arab 
countries that expresses a united position on Jerusalem. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that this message will be approved by 
the Arab group and sent to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali 
and to the president of the UN Security Council to be 
distributed as an official document. 
  Regarding inter-Arab solidarity, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid explained 
that the closing of Arab ranks will enable the Arab countries to 
revise some of the principles and charters governing collective 
Arab action and set them forth in a new form that is more in 
line with contemporary Arab wishes. He pointed out that this 
requires a discussion on amending the Arab League charter and 
the establishment of an Arab court of justice as a mechanism to 
solve inter-Arab disputes peacefully and prevent their 
escalation. 
  'Abd-al-Majid said that within the context of a 
comprehensive 
Arab reconciliation, the Arab League seeks to resolve the 
problem of the Kuwaiti detainees and those who are missing. He 
added that this will be a positive factor in allaying the 
current tensions, both for the families of the Kuwaiti detainees 
and the missing and in regard to the efforts to alleviate the 
suffering of the Iraqi people, in whose territorial integrity we 
are concerned and interested. 
  Discussing pan-Arab security, he said: Security, in our 
view, now means one thing--to be or not to be. He noted that 
pan-Arab security now has many sides covering most aspects of 
joint Arab action, both economic and political, as they are two 
sides of the same coin. 
  He urged the Arab League Council to work quickly and 
seriously to restructure the Arab economic situation to help us 
avoid any negative repercussions, especially from the GATT. 
  He expressed regret over the continuing crisis between Libya 
and some Western countries despite Libya's flexible stand and 
eagerness to settle the crisis in the context of international 
legitimacy. He called on the three Western parties to be 
responsive to the efforts by several parties to reach a solution 
that respects Libya's territorial integrity and is in line with 
Article 33 of the UN Charter, which calls for resolving 
differences between states through dialogue and peaceful means. 
  He reiterated the Arab League's support for the United Arab 
Emirates' efforts to regain all its legitimate rights and its 
sovereignty over its three islands in the Gulf. He also 
expressed his support for the United Arab Emirates' measures to 
recover these rights and hoped that Iran will respond by 
handling the issue peacefully and with wisdom. 
  Speaking about the situation in Somalia, 'Abd-al-Majid 
praised President Husni Mubarak's initiative that contributed to 
achieving national reconciliation in Somalia. He said it was 
time that the fraternal Somali people directed their efforts 
toward reconstructing their country so that Somalia can resume 
its role in the Arab arena. 
  Discussing the situation in Yemen and Sudan, the Arab League 
secretary general expressed confidence that the Yemeni leaders' 
wisdom will help overcome this crisis and enhance ties among the 
people in that nation. He said we are following the situation 
in Sudan with extreme concern, and expressed his hope that the 
Arab League Council will adopt a resolution asserting its clear 
commitment to Sudan's unity and its opposition to any attempt to 
separate the south.

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Mar (MENA)--Faruq Qaddumi, head of the 
PLO's Political Department, said in a speech at the opening 
session of the Arab League Council today that the Palestinians 
have come under intense pressure to resume the peace talks 
following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and before measures 
are available for protection of the Palestinian people. He 
called on the cosponsors of the peace process to shoulder their 
responsibilities in providing security for the Palestinian 
people. 
  He added that allowing the massacre to pass without 
punishment could undermine the peace efforts in the area. 
Referring to the racist tendencies in the Israeli Government 
itself, he said that the Israeli Government's actions are 
characterized by violence against the Palestinians, and that the 
massacre has exposed Israel's claim to be a democratic country. 
  Qaddumi affirmed that the PLO is committed to peace, but is 
not prepared to resume the peace talks under these conditions 
and until tangible measures are taken to protect the Palestinian 
people in the occupied territories. 
  He said that the massacre has singled out the problem of the 
settlements as a time bomb that does not help advance the peace 
process. 
  Qaddumi expressed regret at the recent U.S. position at the 
UN Security Council regarding the status of Jerusalem, saying it 
causes concern. He affirmed that the Palestinian people are 
ready to make sacrifices in order to ensure their legitimate 
rights, no matter how long this takes.

  [Text] Khartoum, 27 March (PANA) -- The Sudanese Government 
intends to expel an American relief organization, Area 
Development Agency (ADRA), which it accused of importing and 
distributing relief stuffs contaminated with bacteria. Quoting 
unnamed sources Saturday [26 March],the government owned 
newspaper AL-INQADH AL-WATANI alleged that ADRA had imported 
food contaminated with bacteria in mid 1993 for distribution in 
camps for southern Sudanese populations displaced by the civil 
war and drought. The paper said the organisation would be 
dismissed from Sudan in two days after the decision has been 
published by the attorney general. 
  The paper quoted the Sudanese commissioner for relief 'Abd 
al-Rahman Abu Dawm, as saying the behaviour of ADRA was 
contradictory with its duty as a humanitarian organization and 
breached the international laws and norms of human rights. He 
said ADRA had imported a mixtutre of food stuffs contaminated 
with bacteria with the intention of distributing it to the 
needy. "When concerned authorities refused the mixture the 
agency claimed that the shipment could be used as animal 
fodder," said Abu Dawm. 
  ADRA is one of the biggest reief organizations active in the 
Sudan. With offices in nearly all parts of western and southern 
Sudan with a wide number of staffers both local and foreign.

  [Text] Kuwait, 28 Mar--Information Minister Shaykh Sa'ud 
Nasir al-Sabah, in an interview to the daily AL-WATAN published 
here today, has denied the existence of any Iraqi build up on 
the Kuwaiti borders, pointing out that the build up was taking 
place in the north in Kirkuk and not in the south toward Kuwait. 
  For his part, Defense Minister Shaykh 'Ali Sabah al-Salim 
al-Sabah, in a similar interview to the paper, has stressed that 
the State of Kuwait was fully prepared to respond to any 
provocation or any reckless action the Baghdad regime might 
contemplate. 
  Shaykh 'Ali said "the situation on the northern borders is 
changeable. It could be reassuring today and the opposite 
tomorrow; however, our armed forces are prepared to face up to 
all eventualities", pointing to the existence of coordination 
with the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Egypt, and 
Syria. 
  On the other hand, AL-WATAN has attributed to a high ranking 
Foreign Ministry source as having said that the Foreign Ministry 
had checked the reports circulated by the Iraqi opposition, and 
it was ascertained that the 10th Division of the Iraqi Army has 
moved from the marshes area to the north. 
  The source stressed to the paper that the situation was 
under 
control, an aerial surveillance operation was carried out every 
two hours, all movements were monitored very closely and, 
according to available reports, the picture had not changed in 
12 days. 
  Iraqi opposition in Syria reported two days ago the 
existence 
of an Iraqi forces build up estimated at 180,000 soldiers on the 
Kuwaiti borders.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by 'Adi Talmor, </F>
at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem on 25 March; from 
the weekly "In the Current Situation" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Talmor] Good day and a happy Passover to Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  [Rabin] Good day and a happy holiday to all the Israeli 
people. 
  [Talmor] Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad is undoubtedly no 
al-Sadat or Mubarak. Are you convinced that he really seeks a 
full peace agreement with Israel or is he just pretending to 
want peace in order to secure U.S. economic aid? 
  [Rabin] First of all, it is my pleasant duty to recall the 
past 15 years, which have proven that it is possible to achieve 
a lasting peace with a large, leading Arab country like Egypt 
even in a region as turbulent as the Middle East. I telephoned 
Egyptian President Mubarak yesterday. I expressed my 
appreciation and gratitude to Egypt for signing the peace 
agreement and for proving its ability to adhere to it. The 
Egyptian president said he was happy that I called and said that 
Egypt and Israel had set an example on how to overcome past 
hatreds and build a viable peace. Mubarak expressed the hope at 
this stage that Israel and the other countries engaged in the 
peace process would attain the same accomplishment. 
  I hope and believe, in light of the fact that the talks in 
Cairo ended yesterday on a positive note and will resume in 
Cairo next Tuesday [29 March], that we will first of all 
overcome the issue of security arrangements for the Palestinians 
in Hebron and then of course continue the negotiations to reach 
agreement on the implementation of Gaza-Jericho First, in order 
to show the world that it is possible to reach agreements and to 
implement them. I hope that the agreement's implementation will 
help change facts on the ground, at least in those areas where 
it will take effect in the initial stage. I therefore have 
faith in the future. 
  Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon have already agreed to resume the 
Washington talks at the end of April. I also believe that the 
talks will take a somewhat different form. There will no longer 
be algebraic-like formulas defining what constitutes peace and 
what constitutes withdrawal, but rather a far more comprehensive 
view of peace and withdrawal as packages, withdrawal in stages 
without committing oneself to a final line, and of course 
security arrangements and the subsequent U.S. aid. 
  [Talmor] You may have your faith, Sir, but in south Lebanon 
only this week there were serious terrorist attacks in which 
Katyusha rockets were fired at Israel. The same al-Asad you pin 
so many hopes on was supposed to stop this. 
  [Rabin] There is no doubt that just as you mentioned 
earlier, al-Asad is no al-Sadat. Al-Asad has a different 
approach which makes progress in the peace process more 
difficult. The State of Israel and its people are democratic. 
The Israeli public has to be convinced that the Arab leader it 
is negotiating with really means peace and is willing to hold 
public meetings at the most senior levels.... 
  [Talmor, interrupting] And this is not happening. 
  [Rabin] At this stage of the negotiations with Syria, only 
relatively low-level contacts have been held. If this does not 
change at some stage -- if higher-level contacts are not held, 
if the Syrian media does not show greater openness, if Syrian 
leaders do not issue clearer public statements on their 
intention to reach peace -- it will be very difficult to make 
progress in the negotiations. Clearly, and as a further 
projection of this, Syria also has the capability to keep things 
quiet along Israel's northern border. 
  [Talmor] Why did Israel not come out with a more vigorous 
and aggressive reaction to this week's Katyusha attacks against 
the Israeli border and even against areas inside Israel? 
  [Rabin] First of all, we did react. Last week's Katyusha 
firing was an exception because there are understandings which 
are basically kept. According to these understandings, no 
Katyushas are to be fired at Israel's northern border 
settlements. 
  [Talmor] But the Katyushas could have fallen on Israeli 
settlements? 
  [Rabin] Nothing can be hermetically sealed. In general, the 
residents of the northern settlements along the Lebanese border 
live in greater security and tranquility today than they did 
before July 1993. I am sure that this Passover, tens of 
thousands of Israelis will safely spend their holiday in the 
Galilee. 
  [Talmor] Mr. Rabin, you mentioned the telephone conversation 
you held with President Mubarak to mark 15 years of peace. Does 
Mubarak's regime appear stable from Jerusalem's perspective. Is 
there no danger of an Islamic revolution similar to the one 
which swept Iran? 
  [Rabin] I think that the Egyptian reality is completely 
different than that of Iran although a terroristic, radical, 
Islamic movement exists there as well. I believe that the 
majority of the Egyptian people support President Mubarak's 
regime, would like to see continued economic development, and do 
not exhibit any leaning toward the Iranian brand of 
nationalistic or religious-nationalistic extremism. Terrorist 
attacks are carried out here and there. That, regrettably, is a 
part of Arab society and the Islamic world. Terrorism is a fact 
of life in most of the neighboring countries as well as in more 
distant ones. 
  I have confidence in the strength of President Mubarak's 
government and have no doubt that he adheres to his 
comprehensive policy of both encouraging peace and extending 
Egypt's assistance to Israel and to its Arab interlocutors in 
reaching peace. We see this for a fact: most of the recent 
contacts have taken place in Cairo or at other Egyptian 
locations. 
  [Talmor] This interview is taking place immediately 
following the return of the Israeli delegation from Cairo. Now 
that you have been briefed and held consultations, can you tell 
us what the Palestinians will ultimately receive in return for 
their agreement to continue the talks in Cairo next Tuesday? 
Will Hebron be awarded an almost equal status to that of 
Jericho and Gaza? 
  [Rabin] No, Hebron will not be given a similar status to 
neither Gaza nor Jericho. Nevertheless, I cannot ignore the 
horrendous massacre which took place at the Cave of the 
Patriarchs. I cannot ignore the fact that we have been keeping 
Hebron under curfew for almost one month in order to prevent 
friction between the approximately 120,000 Arab residents of 
Hebron and the 415 Israeli Jews who live there, whether as 
permanent residents or as students at the Shavey Hebron Yeshiva. 
This state of affairs is unacceptable and I am talking as a Jew 
and an Israeli. It is totally unacceptable that the 
Palestinians be the ones to suffer on account of this despicable 
massacre, which was committed by a Jewish criminal. At the same 
time, I want to make sure that the war against the enemies of 
peace, such as Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the 
Islamic Jihad, will continue full blast. Even while our 
delegation was sitting down with the PLO representatives in 
Cairo, we did not hesitate to carry out an operation which led 
to the elimination of at least three Hamas terrorists who had 
participated in the murder of Jews and were continuing to plan 
additional murders. 
  We will guarantee the security of the Israelis living in 
Hebron but it is difficult to explain to the world and to 
ourselves why the burden for this despicable massacre in the 
Cave of the Patriarchs should fall, and has fallen for the past 
month, on the 100,000 Arab residents of Hebron. Therefore, we 
must offer reasonable security arrangements for the Palestinian 
residents of Hebron. We agreed to a temporary international 
presence in Hebron, which will help the town return to normal 
life and report to the Palestinian-Israeli liaison committee, 
the mayor, and to the military governor. 
  [Talmor] Do you not fear that Hebron may set a precedent 
for subsequent Palestinian demands in Nabulus and other cities? 
  [Rabin] I believe that what happened in the Cave of the 
Patriarchs was really a despicable, murderous, aberration, which 
will not be repeated. Therefore, there will be no need for such 
a precedent. 
  [Talmor] Is Israel still considering moving all the Jewish 
settlers in Hebron to one location or perhaps even evacuating 
the Jews from the town? 
  [Rabin] I do not think that at this stage we, or at least I, 
have any intention of evacuating the Jews living in Hebron. All 
the rest is not an issue for public statements. This is an 
Israeli decision which should not fall within the framework of 
returning life to normal in Hebron or resuming the negotiations 
on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. 
  [Talmor] Any discussion of the Hebron massacre inevitably 
leads us to the state commission of inquiry investigating it. 
In your opinion, Mr. Rabin, how has the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] and the defense establishment portrayed themselves so 
far in the state commission's hearings? 
  [Rabin] At this stage, I do not intend to discuss issues 
being discussed in detail by the commission. A state 
commission, made up of distinguished and experienced people, has 
been established, and I am sure that it will do the kind of job 
expected from such a commission and present its recommendations 
to the government. Then I will be able to comment. Right now, 
I would like to merely state in general that the IDF is the 
sovereign body in the territories on behalf of the Israeli 
Government. Ever since the inception of the intifadah, the IDF 
has been facing challenges it never had to face before. Seven 
years have passed and it has learned to handle these challenges. 
It has had to enforce law and order under the special 
circumstances of a civil uprising by the Palestinians in the 
territories against the Army. This is not an easy task. 
Elsewhere in the world, armies are not usually employed for 
this kind of job, which is mainly police work in addition to 
confronting terrorist squads. I do not believe that any other 
army in the world would have met this challenge while retaining 
its moral caliber, the values of the IDF, and the authentic 
values of the Jewish people -- not those of the murderer from 
Qiryat Arba'. I admit that mistakes have been made and mishaps 
have occurred. I am talking about widespread activities, day 
and night, 365 days a year for over seven years. Hundreds of 
thousands of IDF soldiers have served dutifully despite all the 
difficulties. I have nothing but praise for the IDF. 
  [Talmor] Sir, you are probably aware that the public 
believes that the commission could ultimately find you, as 
defense minister, responsible for what happened in Hebron and 
perhaps even topple the government. 
  [Rabin] As prime minister and defense minister I bear 
ministerial responsibility for whatever happens in the framework 
of my duties. I am talking about responsibility in the correct 
sense of the word. I am not responsible for every slip-up by a 
sentry, battalion commander, or even brigade commander -- if the 
appropriate orders had indeed been issued in a timely fashion. 
Not everything falls under the framework of collective 
responsibility and I believe that what you described earlier 
will not come to pass. 
  (Talmor] Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, 
thank you very much and a happy holiday. 
  [Rabin] Happy holidays. I would like to use this 
opportunity to express my thanks, appreciation, and holiday 
greetings to the IDF soldiers, the Border Police, the Israeli 
police, and to all those who guarantee the security of Israel's 
civilians.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Roni Daniyel] </F>
  [Text] Over the past few days the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] in Gaza has completed all preparations for the 
evacuation of bases from the Gaza Strip. The Southern Command 
can evacuate the region in less than a week from the moment the 
agreement with the PLO is signed. Our military correspondent 
Roni Daniyel has the details: 
  Everything which is not vital has already been removed from 
the Gaza Strip, and the Southern Command can carry out the task 
of evacuation, if and when the agreements are signed, by the 
middle of April. We are not fully packed, it was stated in the 
Southern Command, but what is left can be evacuated in only a 
few days. There are detailed plans for overlapping with the 
Palestinian security forces, including a joint command for the 
days of the evacuation which will begin in Rafah and end in Gaza. 
  The security system which will be in effect after the 
evacuation is also already in operation in the Qatif Bloc. The 
usual security activity, including the chasing of armed wanted 
people, continues, but the IDF is surely waiting for the signing 
of the agreement and the evacuation.

<F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Damascus Welcomes `Guarantees' </F>
Offered by Ross of Progress in Peace Negotiations"] 
  [Excerpt] Damascus -- Syria yesterday welcomed the 
guarantees of real progress this year which Dennis Ross, U.S. 
coordinator of the peace process, offered to Syrian officials. 
It also urged the U.S. Administration to change the Israeli 
position in the peace negotiations. Syrian sources said that 
Ross' renewal of the Washington administration's commitment to 
achieving progress in the peace process is "positive, 
encouraging, reinforces the credibility of the U.S. role, and 
reflects Washington's wish to shoulder its moral and political 
responsibilities and to fulfill the promises and pledges it has 
made in the past to establish a just and comprehensive peace in 
the Middle East." 
  The Syrian sources, which reflect an official view, added 
that "logic says that compelling Israel to adhere to the 
foundations of the peace process is the only way to guarantee 
the achievement of the desired progress and to help to secure 
factors ensuring success for the peace process and to avert 
failure." 
  The sources pointed out that Syria will respond to 
Washington's new obligations to establish a "lasting" peace. If 
this peace does not come, the situation will be like a temporary 
truce that could collapse at any moment and with the first shock. 
  The sources stressed that Syria's eagerness to respond to 
the 
U.S. Administration's commitment to making the peace process in 
the region a success "stems from eagerness to recover the Arab 
land and rights in full.... Just as Syria is committed to these 
principles, it is also committed to the peace process as a 
historic opportunity that is supposed to eventually lead to the 
establishment of a real and strong peace based on the principles 
of right and justice." The sources pointed out that anyone who 
wants to advance the peace process "is urged to persuade the 
rulers of Tel Aviv...to recognize the principle of complete 
withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories." [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif </F>
by Zaki Shihab in Tehran; date not given] 
  [Text] [Shihab] How do you assess the state of 
Iranian-Iraqi relations in light of recent bilateral contacts? 
  [Zarif] It is a matter of policy for us in Iran to cultivate 
good relations with all our neighbors, particularly those with 
which we share borders. This holds for Iraq and the other Arab 
states, as well as the republics of the former Soviet Union and 
Turkey. 
  Our intention is to sort out all our problems with Iraq. To 
that end, we initiated confidence-building measures, 
particularly after the end of the war Iraq triggered. Recent 
moves to improve our ties with Iraq began in Karachi, where our 
foreign ministers met. There was another session in New York. 
The two sides agreed to follow up with exchange visits on 
various occasions with a view to ironing out outstanding issues. 
  My visit to Baghdad was to lay the groundwork for this and 
to 
ensure the success of any future talks between the Iraqi and 
Iranian foreign ministers. After my visit to Baghdad, a top 
Iraqi Foreign Ministry official came here. 
  [Shihab] What did you talk about at these sessions? 
  [Zarif] The prisoners of war, disputed border demarcation, 
and coordination on reactivating the Shatt al-'Arab, plus other 
technical matters. The Iraqis raised the question of their 
aircraft that landed on our territory in the wake of the 
invasion of Kuwait. For our part, we brought up the issue of the 
Iranian planes that landed in Iraq, that were either hijacked or 
whose pilots defected. 
  [Shihab] How many Iranian are held by Iraq? 
  [Zarif] Twenty, the last plane was commandeered to Baghdad 
about two months ago. It is still being held there in 
contravention of international aviation rules that require Iraq 
to return it and hand over the hijackers. As for the Iraqi 
planes that landed on our territory against our will, we think 
that as long as the international embargo remains in place, we 
should keep them, as stipulated by UN Security Council and UN 
resolutions. 
  [Shihab] Is your call for a restoration of ties with Iraq 
tactical, or is it based on strategic considerations? 
  [Zarif] We view our relations with Iraq from a strategic 
perspective, based on a desire on our part to nurture good and 
cooperative relations with all our neighbors. It is in this 
frame of mind that we have sought to bury the hatchet. In other 
words, we have been trying to rise above the wounds of the war 
that exhausted our manpower and economic resources. We have 
worked and are still working on starting with a clean slate. We 
are reaching out to our neighbors in the south of the Gulf in 
the interest of regional stability and to forestall attempts by 
external powers to destabilize the region in order to justify 
their continued presence. Let me repeat that we are now 
approaching Iraq from a strategic perspective. Naturally, 
pressing issues still need to be addressed. For instance, the 
prisoners of war [POW's]. We still think Iraq holds a large 
number. 
  [Shihab] Can you be specific about the number? 
  [Zarif] The trouble is that the Iraqi Government has been 
asserting for some time that it has none. This is at odds with 
our estimates. We have documents to show that there are 8,000 
Iranian prisoners in Iraq. We have provided the International 
Committe of the Red Cross [ICRC] with information about 3,700 
prisoners. We also know there are Iranian prisoners in two 
Iraqi camps to which the ICRC has been denied access. According 
to our records, there are 39,000 Iranian prisoners in Iraq, of 
whom only 18,000 are registered with the ICRC. The ICRC knows 
nothing about the rest. Some of these have been in detention for 
more than five years. The question of prisoners of war is a 
humanitarian one and so needs urgent attention. We have been 
asking our Iraqi brothers to do something positive about this 
issue so the POW's dossier can be closed. 
  [Shihab] What was Iraq's reply? 
  [Zarif] The Iraqis said they had been pressed to raise the 
issue of the Iraqi POW's in Iran and that they had no interest 
in keeping any Iranian POW. They said: We want to clarify the 
matter and clear the air. There are many other issues on which 
we should cooperate so we can succeed in building and enhancing 
confidence between the two sides, on both the official and 
popular levels. 
  [Shihab] Do you have the impression that Iraq's replies are 
true and sincere? 
  [Zarif] It is difficult to comment on that. However, I hope 
the Iraqis are sincere. We in Iran and Iraq will remain 
neighbors forever, whether we like it or not. This is one of 
life's realities. 
  [Shihab] Have you sensed any Iraqi effort to resolve the 
problem of the POW's? 
  [Zarif] We have not yet received any signs of such 
readiness. 
We made proposals at the negotiating table. They also explained 
their views on several issues. 
  [Shihab] Did they deny the presence of Iranian POW's in 
Iraq? 
  [Zarif] Yes, they did. 
  [Shihab] Do you have any evidence supporting your claims of 
the presence of such POW's? 
  [Zarif] We have no evidence, but we strongly feel a large 
number of Iranian POW's are still detained in camps. We are 
making every effort to apply UN resolutions regarding relations 
between the two countries. Iran has previously complied with 
these laws, and it will continue to do so in the future. 
  [Shihab] Regarding the aircraft issue, the Iraqi Government 
is talking about 100 aircraft, while you are talking only about 
20 or 30 Iraqi aircraft in Iran. 
  [Zarif] The problem is that the Iraqis believe all the 
aircraft that left Iraq headed for Iranian territory. This is 
wrong. Some Iraqi aircraft that took off crashed and some 
others returned to Iraq. Iraq believes every aircraft seen on 
radar heading for our territory and our airspace is in Iran. 
This is untrue. We are honest in seeking a solution to this 
problem. Iran has about 20 aircraft in Iraq. Some of them 
were, as I said, hijacked. Regrettably, the hijackers were not 
tried or extradited and the aircraft were not returned. 
  [Shihab] How many Iraqi aircraft crashed in Iranian 
territory? 
  [Zarif] I don't have a specific figure in mind. Here, I 
would like to add that some of the aircraft that landed in our 
airports were Kuwaiti aircraft Iraq seized after its invasion of 
Kuwait. We carried out maintenance work and returned them to 
their original owners. 
  [Shihab] How many? 
  [Zarif] About six, and we still expect the Kuwaiti 
Government 
to pay the costs of their maintenance in Iran. 
  [Shihab] How may Iraqi aircraft are at your airports? 
  [Zarif] We had announced the arrival of 22 aircraft, 
including the six Kuwaiti aircraft that were returned. 
  [Shihab] What are your conditions for returning the Iraqi 
aircraft? 
  [Zarif] The international embargo imposed on Iraq does not 
allow their return. When the embargo is lifted, we will discuss 
and resolve the issue within the general framework of the 
Iraqi-Iranian relationship. Our aircraft are still held in 
Iraq, and we have to resolve that problem. 
  [Shihab] To what extent do you agree with the Iraqi 
Government confrontation of the establishment of a Kurdish 
state, especially since you have previously said you reject the 
establishment of a new Israel on your border? 
  [Zarif] We clarified our position on the need to maintain 
Iraq's territorial integrity from the beginning, after we felt 
that some had ambitions in the region. This was not a 
unilateral Iranian position. Syria and Turkey shared with us 
the idea during the periodic meetings we held. We agree with 
many Arab and foreign countries that Iraq should remain unified. 
We reject the partition of Iraq. Any attempt to partition it 
will create problems and dangers that will threaten a number of 
the region's countries. From the very beginning, we opposed 
Iraq's invasion of the State of Kuwait. We will take a similar 
position in the future. On the international level, we also had 
a similar position on Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh. We also 
urged some Gulf Cooperation Council member states to solve their 
border disputes through understanding, because we believe 
dialogue is the best means for understanding. 
  [Shihab] You are talking about an understanding with 
Turkey about the issue of a Kurdish state in northern Iraq. But 
Turkey has often charged that Iran is extending military aid to 
banned Kurdish groups in Turkey. 
  [Zarif] I have seen such reports, but Turkey and Iran have a 
complete understanding about the situation in Iraq and the 
violability of its territorial integrity. We have also reached 
an understanding on combating terrorism from whatever source it 
comes. We look forward to the day when Iraq complies with all UN 
resolutions and reasserts its authority on all its territory. 
Syria also shares this hope. 
  [Shihab] Are you worried by the cooperation between the 
Kurds and certain Western nations? 
  [Zarif] Human rights in Iraqi Kurdistan is not a new issue. 
What is new, however, is the newfound Western and American 
interest in the matter. Then, you have the Israeli presence in 
northern Iraq on which we must keep a watchful eye. 
  [Shihab] What evidence do you have of Israeli-Kurdish 
cooperation close to the border with Iran? 
  [Zarif] We have heard much about this presence and this 
cooperation. 
  [Shihab] Have you received reports about the matter? 
  [Zarif] We have received reports. We are following them 
closely. There are indications that there have been visits and 
contacts that have nothing to do with humanitarian and social 
work. They are purely political and suggest ill intentions. 
  [Shihab] One of the issues that will come up during the 
forthcoming visit to Baghdad by 'Ali Akbar Velayati is the 
future of Iranian and Iraqi opposition groups -- Mojahedin-e 
Khalq and the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution of Iraq 
[SAIRI]. Have you reached an understanding with Iraq on the 
activities of the two organizations? 
  [Zarif] From the start of the war imposed upon us by Iraq, 
mercenaries have been working on behalf of the Iraqi Government. 
They have mounted numerous terrorist attacks for the enemy. We 
are not worried about the presence of such hypocrites on Iraqi 
territory. However, if Iraq really does want to turn a new leaf 
in its relations with Iran, we will certainly pursue our 
security and our people's safety. Thus, if any terrorist groups 
mount an offensive action on our territory, we will have to 
pursue them across the border into Iraq where they maintain 
bases. Cooperation between the two countries is hardly advanced 
by giving refuge to such people. They have to be barred from 
pursuing any activities that will damage relations between Iraq 
and Iran. 
  [Shihab] How did the Iraqis react to your proposals 
regarding Mojahedin-e Khalq and SAIRI, led by Muhammad Baqir 
al-Hakim? 
  [Zarif] The human rights issue in Iraq must be addressed. 
We think the reasons that prompted hundreds of thousands of 
Iraqis to cross into Iranian territory must also be addressed. 
We are playing host to them on humanitarian grounds. There is 
no comparison between the presence of SAIRI in Iran and that of 
Mojahedin-e Khalq in Iraq. 
  [Shihab] Are we likely to see Iranian pilgrims visiting 
al-Najaf and Karbala' anytime soon? 
  [Zarif] This is one of the issues that we discussed with the 
Iraqis. We want to see movement of people in both directions 
for visits to holy sites. We are striving to work out an 
arrangement. 
  [Shihab] When do you expect a solution on that front? 
  [Zarif] We have been cooperative. The ball is now in the 
Iraqi court. 
  [Shihab] When will Dr. Velayati visit Baghdad? 
  [Zarif] Within the next two months. There are a number of 
outstanding issues we hope will be straightened out through 
diplomatic channels before a date is set for the visit.

  [Text] Baghdad, 27 Mar (INA) -- His Excellency leader 
President Saddam Husayn has chaired a joint session of the 
Revolution Command Council [RCC] and the Iraq Command of the 
Arab Socialist Ba'th Party [ASBP]. 
  The meeting reviewed the visit to New York by an Iraqi 
delegation led by Tariq 'Aziz, deputy prime minister and member 
of the RCC and the Iraqi Command of the ASBP, and the outcome of 
his contacts with the members of the UN Security Council. 
  After the meeting, an official spokesman made the following 
statement: 
  Our delegation noticed that there are circles in the 
Security 
Council that may grow into a majority that have begun to sense 
the harshness of the blockade to which the Iraqi people are 
being subjected. These circles are taking a positive outlook on 
Iraq's implementation of the obligations enshrined in Resolution 
687. The nations that represent this trend stressed the need 
for Rolf Ekeus to present a monthly report to the council about 
the Special Commission's relations with Iraq and for this to 
lead to the commission setting the beginning and period of what 
was called the test in order for the Security Council to move to 
the implementation of Paragraph 22, which should not take long. 
  Some council members mentioned six months as a suitable 
period to test the implementation mechanism. Other member 
nations wondered why the period could not be a little shorter or 
longer to make sure that Ekeus draws up his timetable on clear 
and practical grounds rather than be swayed by political goals 
that do not meet with the agreement of the council's members who 
moved from a new positive position in their approach to this 
issue. 
  This constructive and fair position was shared by France, 
Russia, and the PRC, along with other nations like Brazil, 
Pakistan, Nigeria, and Rwanda, among others. On the other hand, 
the United States and its supporters, or the countries that are 
influenced by its analyses and intentions, view things from the 
perspective of fabricating excuses to drag out the blockade on 
our people and avoid a commitment to a fixed date for 
implementing Paragraph 22, which allows Iraq to export its 
products, including oil, to the outside world 
  The conclusion we have drawn is that an important positive 
development has occurred in the position of important and 
influential circles in the Security Council. This development 
requires follow-up and encouragement in order to know for 
certain whether or not there is should be serious and imminent 
hope for the lifting of the injustice done to Iraq. The next 
two months will be important to make clear conclusions in light 
of what President Saddam Husayn announced in his address to the 
council of ministers on Sunday, 13 March 1994, the first day of 
the blessed 'Id al-Fitr. After two months, the ASBP command and 
the RCC will be able to make the suitable decisions. 
  The official spokesman said: On this occasion, we pay 
special tribute to the states whose positions were clear in this 
direction. These specifically included France, Russia, China, 
and Brazil. We appeal to these countries to develop their 
positions to become clearer and more influential within the 
Security Council and the circles in which they have influence. 
While following up all the details of these developments, our 
great people will not forget the fair stands of these states and 
whoever support this just position. It is obvious that the basis 
for the development in the stands of these countries vis-a-vis 
Iraq is the firmness and patience of our great people; their 
active social, political, and economic life; our people's strong 
adherence to their future; and their firm and unshakeable faith 
in their nationalism. 
  The ASBP command and the RCC adopted a series of 
instructions 
and resolutions to follow up the political and diplomatic move 
in the coming period and until the next Security Council review 
[of the sanctions on Iraq] in the second half of May.

  [Text] Leaders of G-15 countries have expressed serious 
concern over attempts by developed countries to raise new trade 
barriers after of the conclusion of GATT agreement. At the 
plenary meeting of the summit in New Delhi today, they pointed 
out that new areas of trade distortions are being created by 
raising issues like human rights and environment. This could 
create new difficulties for developing countries who are now 
carrying out economic reforms. Instead the leaders wanted 
greater market access to developing countries to help their 
reform process. 
  The summit leaders have agreed to have wider consultations 
among member countries to achieve a concerted and coordinated 
approach to promote trade in the wake of protectionism. They 
said it is the mandate of the developing countries that there 
should be greater cooperation between the South-South countries. 
Eighteen on-going projects were reviewed and the need for 
setting up a monitoring system to speed up the implementation 
was highlighted. The heads of state and government have also 
decided to establish two projects. They include the setting up 
of a renewable energy promotion center and a project on the 
transfer of technology and development to achieve 
self-sufficiency in food production and energy supplies. 
  The prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, himself set the tone 
of the summit by cautioning against replacing the old barriers 
lowered by GATT proposals with new ones in the guise of 
noneconomic concerns. Inaugurating the three-day summit, he 
said there is reason for concern over attempts to undermine 
multi-lateralism because of unilateral action and demands for 
concessions beyond those agreed to at Uruguay Round of 
negotiations. Mr. Rao called for mobilizing world opinion 
against forces of terrorism, separatism, and fundamentalism. He 
also referred to the wide-ranging issues, including the 
restructuring the United Nations, constructive dialogue with the 
G-7 industrialized nations and the need for closer economic 
cooperation. President Suharto of Indonesia, who spoke as the 
Asian group representative, regretted that developing nations 
have very little to say in shaping global economic policies. He 
warned that if the changing international scenario is not 
managed with care now, it may end up with pernicious North-South 
economic divide. Speaking on behalf of the African group, 
President Sani Abacha of Nigeria called for specific projects 
for removal of poverty, job creation, industrialization ,and 
debt reduction. 
  AIR [All India Radio] correspondent reports that the main 
concern of the leaders who spoke at the summit today was on 
creating closer economic ties among the developing nations at 
this critical juncture. President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and 
President Abdou Diouf of Senegeal were also seated on the podium 
of the plenary hall in the Vigyan Bhavan [conference hall], 
which was decorated for the summit with flags and buntings. 
  Briefing newsmen later, an official spokesman said all the 
leaders participated in the plenary session. The special envoys 
representing other countries joined them in informal 
consultations later. They discussed at length the restructuring 
and democratization of the United Nations, including the 
security Council, and international financial institutions like 
the IMF and the World bank. The business forum of the G-15 
countries, which also met simultaneously today, expressed 
concern at advanced countries raising nontariff issues like 
human rights and child labor to block exports from developing 
countries. Presiding over the meeting, the commerce minister, 
Mr. Pranab Mukherji, called for collective action of the group 
to counter such moves.

  [Text] Tunis, 29 Mar (MENA)--A high level Palestinian 
source has revealed that the agreement to be signed between the 
PLO and Israel in Cairo today provides for resuming the talks 
between the two sides with a view to implementing the 
Gaza-Jericho Agreement as soon as possible. It also provides 
for Israel's adoption of a set of measures to meet the 
increasing security needs of the Palestinians, especially in 
Hebron. 
  The Palestinian source informed the MENA correspondent in 
Tunis of the text of the agreement, which includes the following 
points: 
  A. A temporary international presence in Hebron. 
  B. Deployment of the Palestinian police force and its 
activity in Hebron. 
  C. Joint patrols in Hebron. 
  D. Israel's responsibility for the security of all 
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including 
Jerusalem. 
  E. Resumption of the Gaza-Jericho talks as of today. 
  The following is the text of the agreement: 
  Following the heinous crime in Hebron and in accordance with 
Security Council Resolution 904, the Israeli and PLO delegations 
met in Cairo on 23 March and agreed to adopt the following 
measures to meet the increasing security needs of the 
Palestinians, especially in Hebron. 
  This agreement led to resuming the talks between the two 
sides to implement the Gaza-Jericho agreement as soon as 
possible. 
  A. [letter as received] A temporary international presence 
in 
Hebron. 
  Israel believes this presence should be for observation 
purposes, while the PLO believes it should be for the purpose of 
meeting the Palestinians' need for security and stability by 
helping with observation and submitting reports on the acts that 
affect the safety of the Palestinians and their property, which 
will encourage the return of normal life among the Palestinians. 
  To facilitate the tasks of the international observer force, 
an office will be set up in Hebron. The office will submit 
periodic reports to the joint Israeli-Palestinian Liaison 
Affairs Committee to be formed in accordance with the 
Declaration of Principles. 
  The international observer force will submit reports on 
specific incidents to the Joint Hebron Committee composed of the 
Israeli military governor of Hebron, the Palestinian mayor of 
Hebron, and the commander of the soon-to-be-formed Palestinian 
police for the town. The PLO believes an invitation should be 
sent to the representative of the international observer force 
to participate in the meetings of the Joint Liaison Affairs 
Committee. 
  Israel believes the members of the international observer 
force should wear civilian clothes and carry pistols, while the 
PLO believes they should wear official uniforms with special 
insignia to be agreed upon by the two sides, that their cars 
carry this insignia, and that they be armed with light weapons 
for self-defense in Hebron. 
  Israel believes the international observer force should 
number 20. The PLO believes their number should be 200 in 
addition to an enhanced role for the International Committee of 
the Red Cross by raising the number of its team to 30 
representatives. 
  Israel demands that the financiers appoint 20 Norwegian 
civilians while the PLO demands that the financiers should 
appoint 200 individuals from their own citizens as observers on 
condition that the first batch will be appointed from Norway, 
Egypt, and the United States. 
  The duties of the international observer force are to 
provide 
a sense of security for the Palestinian residents of Hebron and 
create the appropriate atmosphere leading to strengthening the 
prosperity and economic progress of the Palestinians. The duty 
of this force is also to supervise the return of normal life to 
Hebron and to complete reports on that. 
  The members of the international observer force will enjoy 
freedom of movement to perform their duties. This freedom will 
not be limited for any reason other than compelling military 
requirements, which will be temporary and extraordinary measures. 
  The financing countries will bear the expenses of the force. 
The International Red Cross is asked to expand and intensify 
its activities in Hebron by increasing its staff to 30 
individuals. The force can proceed with its work as soon as the 
agreement is signed. Israel is demanding that the term of the 
observer force be three months while the PLO is demanding a 
one-year term with the approval of the two sides, which can be 
extended in accordance with the agreement. 
  Regarding the deployment and activity of the Palestinian 
authority in Hebron and without prejudicing Israel's authority 
and its responsibility for security and public order, the two 
sides agreed on the formation of the Palestinian police and its 
work in the town. 
  Israel demands that the police number 50 individuals while 
the PLO demands that it number 400 policemen who will be chosen 
and appointed by the directorate of the Palestinian police force 
that will be formed in Gaza and Jericho. 
  The duties of the Palestinian police in the town will be to 
protect public establishments and the Palestinian installations 
on which agreement will be reached and to participate in joint 
patrols. The police will periodically hold contacts with the 
directorate of the Palestinian police force to receive general 
instructions, training, and administrative duties connected with 
it. 
  The Palestinian police will submit its reports to the Joint 
Liaison Affairs Committee, which will define the daily activity 
of the Palestinian police personnel in coordination with the 
Israeli security and police forces. Israel's collective 
responsibility for security will be recognized. 
  To coordinate between the Palestinian and Israeli police, 
the 
Joint Liaison Affairs Committee will set up a coordinating 
bureau in Hebron administered jointly and working 24 hours a 
day. The committee will define all details regarding the 
structure and tasks of the Hebron police coordinating bureau. 
  Israel demands that the Palestinian policemen in Hebron wear 
ordinary clothes and carry pistols while the PLO demands that 
they wear a special uniform with an insignia, carry light 
weapons, and that their cars carry special insignia to be agreed 
upon by the Hebron coordinating committee. 
  The two sides will negotiate in Cairo on the organizational 
structure of the Palestinian police in the town and on its 
equipment and vehicles. 
  The Palestinian police in Hebron will work in accordance 
with 
a special decree issued by the military governor defining its 
duties and tasks. 
  As for regulations governing the joint police patrols, the 
duties of which are to provide security for the Palestinians, 
observe the situation, and compile reports on it, Israel 
believes that these patrols should be the same as the patrols in 
the city of Hebron and consist of two Palestinian policemen and 
two Israeli policemen in one vehicle driven by an Israeli 
officer of a higher rank. 
  The PLO believes that there should be two four-wheeled 
vehicles, one Palestinian and the other Israeli. The vehicle 
[not further specified] will be distinguished from other 
vehicles in the area and driven by an Israeli officer of a 
higher rank. He should be in contact with the police 
coordination office. 
  The Joint Hebron Committee is specifying and equipping the 
number of patrols, defining their duties, and drawing up the 
course of their patrol and the routes they should follow. 
  In the agreement, Israel affirmed its responsibility for the 
safety of all Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip, including the city of Hebron. It will continue to 
implement all the necessary measures to avert any conflict 
between the settlers and the Palestinians and to prevent acts of 
violence by the settlers. 
  With respect to the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the two sides 
agreed to resume the Gaza-Jericho negotiations today, Tuesday, 
and to speed them up to make up for lost time. Israel will 
reduce the period of the withdrawal schedule and adhere to the 
dates specified in the Declaration of Principles. 
  Immediately after finalizing the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the 
negotiations on the early transfer of authority will start. The 
two sides will then discuss the possibility of expanding the 
scope of negotiations and resuming them over the transitional 
arrangements in accordance with the Declaration of Principles. 
  The agreement reconfirmed that preparations for the 
permanent 
situation will start as soon as possible on condition that they 
do not continue beyond the third year of the transitional 
period, as is stipulated in the Declaration of Principles. 
  The gradual entry of the Palestinian police into Gaza and 
Jericho will start one week after the resumption of the 
Gaza-Jericho negotiations, so as to start preparations for 
taking on responsibilities and authority.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Ali Nun: "Gaza-Jericho: Implementation Agreement </F>
May Be Signed Tomorrow"] 
  [Excerpt] London, Cairo, AL-HAYAH -- Today, Monday, the 
Palestinian leadership is waiting to hear about the Israeli 
Government's position on the outstanding points concerning 
implementation of Security Council Resolution 904 on Hebron 
security arrangements, which were not settled at last week's 
negotiations in Cairo between the Palestinian delegation, headed 
by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, and the Israeli delegation, headed by 
General Amnon Shahaq, deputy chief of staff. 
  Sha'th told AL-HAYAH over the telephone yesterday that the 
Israeli response "which we might receive from Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin's office by fax or phone will deal with two 
fundamental points: first, the number of Palestinian police 
elements, their weapons, and their authority. Second, the 
number of international observers and their nationalities. If 
we get something that satisfies us, the agreement will be signed 
tomorrow, Tuesday, in Cairo, and a timetable will be drawn up 
immediately to implement this agreement, then we will move to 
complete the negotiations concerning Gaza and Jericho." 
  He pointed out that "utmost precedence is at present given 
to 
security arrangements to Hebron. We will not complete the talks 
on Gaza and Jericho before we finish with this issue. And if 
Rabin is expecting us to begin the self-rule negotiations 
tomorrow, it means that he is going to offer us a satisfactory 
reply on Hebron today." 
  He pointed out that Israel "is agreeing -- in principle -- 
for the first time to implement a Security Council resolution, 
even though some of the details have not yet been completed." 
He ruled out a meeting between President Yasir 'Arafat and 
Rabin "at present." However, he said that this will be on the 
cards "when we reach an agreement on all outstanding points." 
  Well-informed Palestinian sources in Tunis have told 
AL-HAYAH 
that the PLO is demanding the participation of U.S., Russian, 
and Egyptian elements alongside the Norwegian elements in the 
provisional international observation force in Hebron, while 
Israel offers to accept only 20 Norwegian observers armed with 
pistols together with 30 elements from the International Red 
Cross Committee and 50 elements from the Palestinian police. 
The sources say that Israel wants the occupation authorities to 
be the authority to which the Palestinian police should refer, 
and it refuses to allow the international observation force to 
report to the cosponsors of the peace process, that is 
Washington and Moscow -- which is unacceptable to the PLO, which 
for its part believes that any effective foreign measures in 
Hebron require "hundreds of international observers, Palestinian 
police elements, and an international authority that guarantees 
implementation of Resolution 904 and hence a nonrepetition of 
the attacks on the people of the city." 
  The sources ruled out the possibility that the differences 
between the two sides in this connection will be settled "today 
or tomorrow." They believe that "this may require a meeting in 
Cairo between 'Arafat and Rabin before any measure is 
implemented, whether with regard to Hebron, Gaza, or Jericho." 
  The sources confirmed reports released over the past two 
days 
by more than one Israeli and U.S. official regarding the entry 
of Palestinian units into Gaza and Jericho "within days." They 
said that Israel has informed the PLO of its willingness to 
"immediately hand over to it the points the Israeli Army has 
evacuated in Gaza and Jericho. This could take place within 10 
days. Thus it can be said that the implementation of some 
aspects of self-rule will begin before 13 April." [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, chief of the </F>
Palestinian negotiating delegation to the Cairo talks, in Cairo, 
by Sa'id Mu'addi, in the studio; date not given; from the "With 
the Events" program--live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, good evening. 
  [Sha'th] Good evening, Sa'id. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, has the Palestinian side received an 
Israeli reply to the Palestinian proposals on the number of 
Palestinian policemen and international observers who will enter 
Hebron? 
  [Sha'th] We have not yet received any replies on these 
figures. All that we have received is the telephone 
conversation which Major General Shahaq held with me. He told 
me that he will lead the Israeli delegation that will come to 
Cairo tomorrow in order to complete the talks on Hebron 
security. Shahaq said: It is better for us to bring our 
information to Cairo in order to complete this instead of 
conveying it via telephone or fax. 
  Naturally, we understand this, but we hope that the Israeli 
delegation will bring something that will enable us to achieve 
security in Hebron as a prelude to achieving security for all 
Palestinian citizens in the occupied Palestinian territory. 
This is the path that will allow the completion of negotiations 
on Gaza and Jericho. If this does not happen, we will not have 
learned anything from the hard lesson represented by the Hebron 
massacre. This lesson requires us to emphasize measures that 
will prevent the recurrence of such massacres. 
  As you know, the situation in Hebron has been extremely 
tense 
since the massacre. Thus, we cannot delay the implementation of 
the Palestinian measures represented by the Palestinian police 
force, and the UN measures, represented by the international 
observers, as well as the Israeli measures, whose implementation 
is urged, in order to provide security for the Palestinians in 
Hebron and other territories. This is an important and vital 
issue, and I hope the Israeli delegation will bring a reply on 
this issue. 
  [Mu'addi] In your conversation with Maj. Gen. Shahaq, did 
you feel that there were positive signs and that it is possible 
to achieve an agreement tomorrow on the security arrangements in 
Hebron? 
  [Sha'th] I have not received any clear information, apart 
from what I have said. It all depends on what the Israeli 
delegation brings tomorrow, which, I hope, will be positive. I 
also hope that the Israeli cabinet has decided on something that 
will respond to the Palestinians' security needs, particularly 
in Hebron. This will open the way for the completion of 
negotiations. Without this, we will spend the whole time in 
Cairo on Hebron security. 
  [Mu'addi] The PLO has demanded the deployment of Norwegian, 
Egyptian, Russian, and U.S. observers. Has Israel agreed on 
this demand? 
  [Sha'th] As was published and said, Israel is now supportive 
of deploying international observers in Hebron in implementation 
of Security Council Resolution 904, which provides for deploying 
these observers in all occupied Palestinian territories in order 
to provide security for the Palestinians in these territories. 
  Naturally, we agree on the Norwegian observers without 
reservations; they sponsored the peace process, and they are 
still making great efforts to maintain this process. We, 
however, want the important states--which are participating in 
the peace process and supporting both the Palestinian police and 
the coming Palestinian authority; namely, the donors [preceding 
word in English], including, of course, the cosponsors of the 
peace process, Russia and the United States, and also Egypt, 
which is playing an important role in the peace process, as well 
as Norway and other European states--to support both security 
and peace, and this is the reason why we proposed these 
particular states. 
  [Mu'addi] When will the vanguards of the Palestinian 
policemen arrive in Hebron, Jericho, and Gaza? 
  [Sha'th] Once there is agreement on the measures on Hebron 
security, the Palestinian police and the international observers 
will immediately move to Hebron. A few days after we begin the 
Gaza-Jericho negotiations, the vanguards of the Palestinian 
police will head for Gaza and Jericho. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, the last question is: Has the 
Palestinian side received a reply on your proposal to the 
Israeli side on repatriating Mustafa al-Natshah, the former 
mayor of Hebron? 
  [Sha'th] This issue has not yet been discussed, and no 
specific names have been proposed. Mustafa al-Natshah, also 
known as Abu-'Umar, is necessarily the elected mayor of Hebron, 
and thus he carries popular and electoral weight. This issue, 
however, has not yet been discussed on the negotiating table. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, in Cairo, thank you very much. 
  [Sha'th] Thank you.

  [Text] Cairo, March 29 (AFP)--PLO chief negotiator Nabil 
Sha'th on Tuesday [29 March] accused elements within the Israeli 
army of wanting to torpedo the Middle East peace process after 
soldiers shot dead six Palestinians on the eve of a new round of 
talks. 
  The shootings were "a premeditated crime carried out in cold 
blood by killers within the Israeli army who want to kill the 
peace process," Sha'th told AFP. 
  Israeli troops shot dead six members of the armed wing of 
PLO 
chief Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah group on Monday in a Gaza Strip 
refugee camp. Another Palestinian died and 29 were wounded in 
clashes with Israeli troops on Tuesday. 
  Palestinian witnesses denied Israeli army allegations that 
the Fatah men were armed, and said they were shot in cold blood 
as they handed out leaflets. 
  The shootings came as Israel and the PLO prepared to meet in 
Cairo Tuesday amid hopes of clinching a security deal for 
protecting Palestinians, opening the way for a resumption of 
autonomy negotiations. 
  Sha'th said it was not a coincidence that last week "five 
Palestinians were killed in Hebron (last week) on the eve of a 
resumption of talks ... and that they (Israeli soldiers) 
committed a crime in Gaza on the eve of Tuesday's talks." 
  Sha'th said he has also been in touch with the US officials 
about the incident. 
  Army deputy chief of staff General Amnon Shahaq telephoned 
Sha'th during the night to explain the shootings were "not 
premeditated" and that such incidents were unavoidable, Israeli 
state radio said. 
  Sha'th declined to say whether Tuesday's talks would now be 
postponed following the latest shootings. 
  He said he had been in contact with PLO headquarters in 
Tunis 
where "intense meetings have been going on all night." 
  An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman said Israeli 
negotiators were to fly to Cairo Tuesday despite fears that the 
talks may not go ahead. 
  Five Palestinians were killed in a 20-hour Israeli army 
operation last week in Hebron, when soldiers pounded a house 
being used as a hideout for members of the Islamic Resistance 
Movement HAMAS, hours before Israeli and PLO delegations met in 
Cairo.

  [Text] Palestinian peace negotiator Sa'ib 'Urayqat says he 
believes the peace process is coming to an end and there is no 
point in continuing the talks without ensuring effective 
international protection for the Palestinians. 'Urayqat spoke 
with reporter Mark Weiss after the Jabalyah incident. 
  [Begin recording] ['Urayqat] Well, I think Mr. Rabin has 
decided to move massacres from one place to another. It seems 
to me that Palestinian lives are not that important and of no 
value to what authorities of the Israeli Government are 
concerned. [sentence as heard] I think the incidents in Hebron, 
the incidents in Jabalyah today [28 March] are grave. Is this 
Mr. Rabin's response to our demands to have international 
protection? Is this Mr. Rabin's response to us, when we urged so 
many times that this unnecessary use of violence, this 
unnecessary escalation conducted by the Army must stop? We 
think just this stresses our point that until we have effective 
international protection, I think there is no sense in going 
ahead with the peace talks. 
  [Weiss] And what do you think the correct Palestinian 
response should be to the killing of these Fatah activists? 
  ['Urayqat] The killing of Palestinians, irrespective of 
their affiliations, is something of a grave consequence; it is 
something that we take very, very seriously. Human Palestinian 
lives are really very, very important to us. And, Mr. Rabin is 
deciding on the ground the fate of the peace process, which in 
my honest opinion, is coming to its end. 
  [Weiss] Would you support a postponement or a total 
withdrawal of the Palestinian team from the Cairo talks? 
  ['Urayqat] I think that even if they go on talking in Cairo, 
unless they can get an Israeli commitment to evacuate the 
settlers from Hebron, I think if they cannot get a commitment to 
a genuine, effective international protection for the 
Palestinian people, I think these negotiations will be of no 
value. [end recording]

  [Text] A short while ago, we spoke with the chief Israeli 
delegate to the talks with Syria, Israel's Ambassador to the 
United States Itamar Rabinovich, whom we asked whether the 
reported new format of talks with Syria meant a certain 
compromise on the part of each party -- namely, the depth of 
withdrawal on the part of Syria and the nature of peace on 
Israel's part. 
  [Begin recording] [Rabinovich] It does not necessarily mean 
a desire to compromise on this basic equation. Rather, it is an 
acknowledgment that after many months of haggling over this 
issue, the negotiations will be better off if their scope is 
expanded. In this sense, an agreement on the equation is almost 
devoid of any significance. I do not want to belittle it, of 
course, but it does not have any merit per se, and I think both 
the Americans and the Syrians now realize it. 
  [Correspondent Itay Engel] By the way, what was the level at 
which the decision to alter the format was made? Have the 
Syrians agreed to it? So far, we have only heard our prime 
minister's remarks on this matter. 
  [Rabinovich] Just last week, the U.S. peace team visited 
Damascus. Their visit followed the prime minister's U.S. visit 
and talks in this vein. The matter was presented to President 
al-Asad by the U.S. peace team, and we have been told that his 
reaction was favorable and positive. The reaction has generated 
some of the present optimism concerning this track. 
  [Engel] Will the revised format help the Israeli-Syrian 
negotiations out of the bind? Will it lead to a breakthrough? 
  [Rabinovich] I think the revised format of negotiations is 
all you said, but above all, it shows that the negotiations have 
reached a degree of maturity, that the Syrian approach is now 
more realistic in that they now realize that negotiations cannot 
consist of the two parties reiterating their respective stands 
and eventually reaching a verbal agreement. A true agreement is 
first and foremost one which changes the reality. To secure a 
change, the agreement must address that reality. In the reality 
of Israeli-Syrian relations, questions such as security, water, 
and a genuine implementation of the agreement are no less 
important than the verbal and legal formulations on which the 
negotiations had focused until recently. 
  [Engel] Is there an envisaged time frame for the signing of 
a joint declaration of principles that will pave the way for 
negotiations on details? 
  [Rabinovich] I do not want to give rise to expectations of a 
fast breakthrough. The negotiations are difficult and 
complicated, and even if we manage to change the format and the 
climate, I would not want to create an expectation of an 
imminent breakthrough. This process will benefit if it is 
conducted in a new format and if it gathers momentum when the 
talks are resumed at the end of April. I hope to see results in 
the subsequent weeks and months, but it would be definitely 
premature and wrong to start speaking of dates and deadlines. 
  [Engel] Thank you very much, Professor Itamar Rabinovich.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, Jordanian </F>
minister of state for foreign affairs, in Cairo, by Hani 
al-Badri, in the studio on 26 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Badri] Sir, we would like you to give us an 
idea about the general atmosphere of the meetings of the 101st 
session of the Arab League's Ministerial Council in Cairo. 
  [Al-Hasan] I delivered a speech at the beginning of the 
meeting. I explained Jordan's position on the peace process. I 
pointed to the efforts Jordan and His Majesty King Husayn made 
concerning the massacre of worshipers in the holy al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque during the blessed month of Ramadan. 
  In the deliberations, I also pointed to the need to upgrade 
coordination among the Arab parties that are directly concerned 
with the negotiations, and the need to achieve Arab 
reconciliation in a way that leads to good Arab solidarity. 
  [Al-Badri] Your Excellency: You met with the Egyptian prime 
minister this afternoon. Please give us a brief idea about this 
meeting. 
  [Al-Hasan] I indeed had the honor of meeting with his 
excellency the Egyptian prime minister this afternoon. At the 
beginning of the meeting, I conveyed to him the greetings of His 
Excellency Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali. During 
the meeting, which the Jordanian ambassador in Cairo attended, 
we discussed a host of bilateral issues, led by convening the 
Higher Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Committee, which, we hope, will 
hold a meeting in Amman next month. 
  I also briefed his excellency the Egyptian prime minister on 
several Jordanian positions and issues, led by Jordan's position 
on, and adherence to, the peace process, as well as other issues 
linked to the siege on the Gulf of Aqaba we are suffering from, 
and the need to lift the siege on Jordan, which inflicts great 
damage to the Jordanian economy. This damage totals $300 
million a year. 
  Moreover, I briefed the prime minister on some other Arab, 
regional, and international issues. 
  [Al-Badri] With regard to amending the Arab League's 
charter, which is a top priority on the 101st session's agenda 
in Cairo, would you please brief us on the general framework of 
such an amendment? 
  [Al-Hasan] Before answering this question, I would also like 
to note that I met with His Excellency Egyptian Foreign Minister 
'Amr Musa yesterday as part of the continued bilateral 
consultations and coordination. 
  With regard to amending the Arab League's charter, it has 
been agreed to link this issue to pan-Arab security and to delay 
discussing these two issues until there is a better Arab 
situation and until Arab reconciliation is achieved. We hope 
this reconciliation will be realized as soon as possible under 
the best circumstances.

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Mar (MENA)--Iraqi Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf has stressed that Iraq is neither 
keeping nor able to produce any type of weapon of mass 
destruction now that such weapons have been completely destroyed 
under the supervision of the UN commission set up for this 
purpose. 
  In a news conference at the Arab League headquarters this 
evening, al-Sahhaf called on the UN Security Council to lift the 
embargo against Iraq now that the country has met its 
obligations on the destruction of weapons of mass destruction. 
  He said Security Council procrastinations in this regard are 
a kind of political pressure applied by the member states, 
especially the United States, against Iraq to overthrow 
President Saddam Husayn. 
  He noted differences among the Security Council's permanent 
members on the removal of the boycott. He explained that 
France, China, and Russia support lifting the embargo. 
  The Iraqi foreign minister said the Iraqi people are 
suffering diseases, epidemics, and food and medicine shortages. 
He said his country cannot import food and medicine because of 
a lack of finances. This causes large numbers of children and 
elderly to die daily, he said. 
  On Kuwaiti captives and detainees in Iraq, al-Sahhaf 
stressed 
that not one Kuwaiti is imprisoned in Iraq. He said that all 
prisoners from all nationalities were released through the 
International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] at the end of 
the war. 
  He said Iraq is cooperating with the Arab League to solve 
this problem. We invited popular committees from the Kuwaiti 
parliament to see the facts for themselves but the Kuwaitis 
rejected the offer, he said. 
  He said Iraq is prepared to provide all facilities to the 
ICRC, the Arab League, the Gulf states, and any other Arab 
country to solve this problem. 
  He said Iraq's relations with the Gulf states, especially 
Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain, are good. He said Iraq's relations 
with the United Arab Emirates have not been broken off either.

  [Text] Cairo, Mar. 28 (MAP)--The Arab world will gain 
nothing if it remains on the fringe of the developments sweeping 
over the world at political and economic scales, said Moroccan 
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Abdellatif 
Filali. 
  Filali, who led the Moroccan delegation to the 101st 
ordinary 
session of the Arab League Ministerial Council held here March 
25-26, told MAP bureau here he was confident that the Arab 
world, thanks to the wisdom of its leaders, will overcome the 
difficult situation it is going through. 
  Filali underlined the importance of the issues tackled by 
the 
league session recalling that participants have called on the 
Security Council to take measures to guarantee the security of 
all the states in the Middle East and to enable them contribute 
to the promotion of a new era based on understanding, mutual 
trust and cooperation in the social and economic realms. 
  Pointing out that the discussion of a number of issues such 
as security in the Arab world and the boycott of Israel was 
postponed, Filali however deplored the postponement of the item 
related to the Arab League Charter amendment. He said the 
Charter, signed in the forties by seven Arab countries which 
were then independent, must keep pace with the changes taking 
place on the Arab and international scenes. 
  He added however that Morocco backs the idea to revise the 
Charter rather than the idea to amend it, as claimed by some 
member states. 
  Filali, who [words indistinct] had conferred with several 
Arab foreign ministers on the fringes of the league session. He 
thus met with peers from Egypt, the Comoros Islands, Iraq, 
Syria, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia. 
  He also attended Saturday a coordination meeting between the 
foreign ministers of the Arab Maghreb Union (UMA) meant to 
coordinate Maghreban states' stands on the items slated on the 
agenda of the league ministerial session and to review issues of 
concern to UMA. UMA gathers Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, 
Morocco and Tunisia.

  [Text] Cairo, al-Rabia'a 28 [28 March], Jamahiriya News 
Agency -- The Arab League Council has reaffirmed its previously 
adopted resolutions which concern its solidarity with the Great 
Jamahiriyah and it support for its efforts in trying to achieve 
a peaceful and just solution to the crisis between the Great 
Jamahiriyah and the Western countries. 
  In a resolution passed at the end of its meetings the Arab 
League Council expressed its complete support for the proposal 
put (?forward) by the the general secretariat which calls for a 
just trial for the suspects at the headquarters of the 
International Court of Justice in the Hague emphasising to the 
Security Council the importance of following through such a 
proposal taking into account the need for a peaceful solution to 
prevent an escalation which would lead to an increase in tension 
in the region. 
  The Arab League Council entrusted the secretary general with 
the task of following up the execution of the resolution while 
also expressing its full appreciation for the Great 
Jamahiriyah's initiative to solve this crisis in a peaceful and 
just manner. 
  The Arab League Council then reiterated its condemnation of 
the continuation of the unjust harsh measures imposed on the 
Great Jamahiriyah as a result of the baseless resolution imposed 
on the Great Jamahiriyah by the Security Council at the bidding 
of the Western countries expressing its extreme concern at the 
human and material effects of these unjust measures. 
  The Arab League's Resolution was as follows: 
  `The League's Council, referring to Resolution 5156 of 
5/12/1991, 5158 of 16/1/1992, 5156 of 22/2/1992, 5224 of 13/9/ 
1992, 5281 of 19/4/1993 and 5328 of 21/9/ 1993 concerning the 
harsh measures and threats which the Great Socialist Peoples 
Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah is being subjected to by the United 
States, Britain and France. 
  Does refer to Article 33 of the United Nations Charter, 
dealing with the solving of conflicts through negotiation, 
mediation and judicial settlements, does express its extreme 
concern at the human and other suffering incurred by the Libyan 
people and neighboring countries as a result of UN Security 
Council Resolution 748 of 1992 and 883 of 1993, and does 
express its full appreciation for the positive initiatives 
(?undertaken by) Libyan to solve this crisis and its positive 
response to the stipulations of UN Security Council Resolution 
731, and does therefore express its extreme concern for the 
escalation of the crisis by imposing additional sanctions and 
the threat of the use of force, a method which is a violation of 
all international conventions and international law. 
  Does also express its appreciation for the efforts exerted 
by 
the seven-member committee and the secretary general of the Arab 
League in order to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict. 
  After an examination of the general secretariat's 
memorandum, 
and after a perusal of the latest developments of the matter, 
does therefore decide: 1) To reaffirm its previous resolutions 
concerning solidarity with the Great Socialist Peoples Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriyah and support for its efforts in arriving at a 
peaceful solution to the crisis within the framework of respect 
for Libyan national sovereignty and the principles of 
international law. 2) To support the recommendtion of the 
general secretariat calling for a just trial for the suspects, 
presided over by Scottish judges and held according to Scottish 
law at the headquarters of the International Court of Justice in 
the Hague. It urged the Security Council to take this serious 
and novel recommendation into account in order to seek a 
peaceful solution to prevent an escalation which would serve to 
increase the tension in the region.

  [Text] Cairo, 29 Mar (MENA)--PLO Political Department chief 
Faruq Qaddumi has stated that the Palestinians will not resume 
negotiations with Israel on the implementation of self-rule in 
Gaza and Jericho before the Israelis respond to the Palestinian 
proposals, which provide only the minimum of protection for the 
Palestinian people in Hebron. 
  We are awaiting these responses so that our people can feel 
safe, assured, and sense some achievement, Qaddumi told MENA. 
  In his statement, which comes only hours before the 
resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli talks on measures to 
protect Palestinians in Hebron, Qaddumi said an agreement should 
have been reached immediately after the massacre. 
  He said that when the Israelis came to Tunis they promised 
to 
agree immediately to several points. Regrettably, they backed 
down on their promises, as they usually do, he added. 
  Qaddumi said this Israeli policy will not help the political 
settlement. Indeed, he added, it will create further obstacles 
and difficulties. He noted that the Israelis are using the same 
tactics in their negotiations with the Jordanians, the Syrians, 
and the Lebanese. 
  Qaddumi defined the Palestinian leadership's basic demands 
for the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on 
self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, which are scheduled to begin on 
13 April. These include deploying sufficient international 
forces in Hebron and all other occupied Palestinian territories 
in accordance with Security Council Resolution 904, evacuating 
the settlers from Hebron, implementing the withdrawal as 
scheduled, and discussing the Israeli settlements in the 
occupied territories. He said these settlements constitute not 
only an obstacle, but a threat to the entire political process. 
  Qaddumi said the Israelis are evading the implementation of 
Security Council Resolution 904 on international protection for 
the Palestinians. 
  He said talk about differences over the size of the 
Palestinian police force, the international protection force, 
and joint Palestinian-Israeli patrols is merely an Israeli 
attempt to dwarf Palestinian demands. It is as if the 
differences were over numbers, not principles, he said. 
  He said Israel is still evading acceptance of these 
conditions, basically on the pretext of numbers, while it really 
does not want to implement the Security Council resolution. 
  Qaddumi stated: "I challenge Israel to announce that it is 
ready to discuss the settlements, which represent an obstacle to 
peace. I challenge Israel to withdraw immediately or to disarm 
the settlers." 
  All this, Qaddumi maintained, indicates that our differences 
with Israel are over principles, not over numbers or other 
similar things, which are raised only to play down the real 
differences at the negotiations. 
  Qaddumi said the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations are moving 
with extreme difficulty. We have had this in mind from the 
beginning, he said, noting Egypt's experience in its three years 
of negotiations with Israel over Taba. 
  Qaddumi said in this regard that during those negotiations, 
Israel presented maps to Egypt, which had to go to Istanbul--as 
late Turkish President Turgut Ozal told him--to obtain the right 
maps. This shows Israel's constant policy of forging facts and 
procrastinating, Qaddumi said. 
  He said that while Israel has repeatedly claimed it would 
withdraw from the territories it occupied in 1967, it is 
actually fabricating further obstacles and excuses to maintain 
its occupation. 
  Qaddumi stressed that the Palestinian leadership is under 
pressure and strong criticism from the Palestinian people inside 
the occupied territories. He also noted frustration among the 
Palestinian people, which was reflected in the escalation of the 
intifadah. 
  All this constitutes pressure on the Palestinian leadership, 
he said. The Palestinian people in the occupied territories, he 
added, want the negotiations to be broken up until Israel, the 
Security Council, and the sponsors of the peace conference--the 
United States and Russia--implement the Security Council 
resolution. He said the Palestinian people do not want the 
leadership to go to the negotiations before the world provides 
the necessary measures for the Palestinians to feel safe and 
assured. 
  Qaddumi said: Our people have taken the initiative and 
escalated their intifadah against Israel to tell the world that 
they reject settlements and want a speedy withdrawal. These are 
two basic demands by the Palestinian people in the occupied 
territories. 
  On Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar's implicit 
criticism that the Palestinians failed to coordinate with the 
other Arab parties involved in the peace process, Qaddumi said 
the Palestinians were the ones who sought coordination. He 
noted that the PLO worked to end its estrangement with Syria 
after the Gulf war. 
  He explained: We went to Damascus and began to coordinate 
with Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Egypt. We are extremely eager 
for Arab coordination, which must continue. 
  Noting that the Syrians consider the signing of the Oslo 
Agreement a departure from Arab coordination, Qaddumi said that 
despite the contents of that agreement--which he himself 
opposed-- one should not keep bringing up these matters because 
it will only weaken the Arabs' negotiating cards. 
  He said that the Syrian foreign minister stressed during 
their recent meeting in Damascus that Syria was ready to 
coordinate with the Palestinians to mobilize international 
public opinion after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. This is a 
positive Syrian position, he said. 
  Qaddumi stressed that the Palestinian side is in direct 
contact with the brothers in Syria on coordination. 
  All of us in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, and the PLO are 
stressing the importance of Arab cooperation, without which we 
will weaken our negotiating cards, he said. 
  He said that the Palestinian leadership has decided to 
return 
to this policy as soon as possible. 
  On the importance of coordination before a return to the 
negotiations, the PLO Political Department chief said that under 
clear instructions from the Palestinian leadership he held 
direct talks with the foreign ministers of Syria, Jordan, and 
other Arab countries. He said he also instructed the 
Palestinian representative at the United Nations to coordinate 
with the Arab group and its chairman, Ambassador Nabil al-'Arabi 
of Egypt. 
  He said the PLO also called for an urgent Arab League 
meeting, which resulted in resolutions condemning the Hebron 
massacre and explaining Arab demands. He said Arab coordination 
over the massacre was evident. 
  At the end of his statement, Qaddumi expressed the belief 
that the Israelis will not be honest during today's talks in 
Cairo. 
  By applying international pressure on them and exposing 
their 
positions, we must force the Israelis to meet the Palestinian 
demands, which were recognized by the UN Security Council, he 
said. 
  He stressed that Israel fears to live in a political 
isolation that would hurt its society and heighten the internal 
dispute to the level of a clash, which is already happening.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Palestinian Spokesman Urges Arab </F>
States To Lift Embargo Imposed on Iraq and Libya, in Retaliation 
for Washington's Position"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI -- A Palestinian spokesman 
has urged the Arab states to lift the embargo imposed on Iraq 
and Libya in retaliation to statements made recently by U.S. 
President Bill Clinton on Jerusalem. 
  PLO Executive Committee member Taysir Khalid said that 
Clinton's statements to leaders of U.S. Jewish organizations on 
Jerusalem "are in conflict with Security Council resolutions, 
which consider Israel's annexation of holy Jerusalem null and 
void. They also conflict with the previous U.S. 
Administrations' positions." He added that the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles agreement "does 
not allow the U.S. Administration to disdain the resolutions of 
international legitimacy concerning Jerusalem, because the 
agreement does not revoke or weaken these resolutions, which are 
binding on the U.S. Administration and the Israeli Government," 
as he said. 
  Members of U.S. Jewish organizations quoted the president as 
saying that he "strongly supports the view that Jerusalem -- its 
east part, occupied in 1967, and west part, occupied in 1948 -- 
should remain `unified' and the capital of the Hebrew state." 
  He pledged that his administration would resist any attempt 
to consider the east part of the city, which has an Arab 
character, to be part of the occupied Arab territories. This is 
what Washington refused to approve of in Security Council 
Resolution 904 condemning the Israeli massacre of al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque worshipers. Khalid, who is also member of the Political 
Bureau of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, 
which is opposed to the declaration of principles agreement and 
the peace negotiations with Israel, urged the "influential 
leaderships in the PLO and the Arab states concerned with the 
negotiations to suspend the bilateral negotiations and the 
multilateral committees until the Israeli Government and the 
U.S. Administration announce their respect for the resolutions 
of international legitimacy related to the Arab 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict and their commitment to the 
negotiation process on the basis of these resolutions."

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad 'Ali al-Qulaybi: "Unannounced Fatah </F>
Central Committee Meeting Discusses Issues Threatening the 
Movement's Future"] 
  [Text] Tunis -- Fatah's Central Committee has been holding 
meetings over the past 48 hours, despite a lack of quorum, to 
discuss serious internal issues threatening the movement's unity. 
  Informed Palestinian sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: 
The meetings were called by Fatah Central Committee Members 
'Abbas Zaki and Muhammad Jihad after a statement was issued 
attacking them vehemently and crudely criticizing their conduct 
and personal lives. That statement was issued several days ago 
in Tunis and faxed to PLO offices and departments. It contained 
expressions contrary to the general ethics and the spirit of 
amity which had governed past differences. 
  The sources said that the statement was not signed and 
concluded with the phrase "this is the first in a series of 
scandals to be published later on." They added that one of 
'Arafat's advisers deported from the occupied territory might be 
behind it. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that during these 
meetings, held in extreme secrecy, 'Abbas Zaki and Muhammad 
Jihad threatened to take measures unprecedented since the famous 
secession of Abu-Musa [Sa'id Musa] and his group in 1983 which 
resulted in armed clashes at the time. 
  Zaki and Jihad blame 'Arafat for what happened, claiming 
that 
had he not protected some individuals, they would not have dared 
commit such folly. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has also learned that these meetings 
coincide with internal Fatah problems, especially in the 
occupied territory, between the conflicting wings of the 
movement, some of which have for some time now been rejecting 
President 'Arafat's appointment of certain individuals in the 
occupied territory. That prompted a delegation of Fatah members 
in the occupied territory to go to Tunis to discuss with the 
leadership these issues and excesses threatening an eruption of 
armed confrontations. 
  According to the same information, a large number of Central 
Committee members have expressed profound resentment of that 
statement and expressed solidarity with 'Abbas Zaki, Muhammad 
Jihad, and others including Abu-Ziyad al-Qurbi who were also 
included in these accusations. They demanded that those who 
were behind that statement should be exposed and so should their 
interest in doing such a thing in these critical circumstances 
when the Central Committee meetings should be concentrating on 
discussion of the "secret" file pertaining to the resumption of 
the negotiations on which talks are now being held in Tunis and 
Cairo without the knowledge of many members, and on the press 
reports about agreement being discussed in Cairo, which would 
mean resumption of the negotiations. But there has been no 
official statement to that effect.

  [Text] The Liberation of Land and Man Group of the Popular

has issued a statement claiming responsibility for killing a 
Zionist soldier in Jerusalem on 23 March 1994. 
  In its statement, the Liberation of Land and Man Group added 
that it fired bullets from a pistol at an enemy soldier's head 
in Jerusalem and took his weapon in reply to the holy al-Ibrahim 
Mosque massacre. 
  The enemy radio acknowledged the operation, claiming the 
soldier was a guard who was transferred to the Hadasa hospital 
where he passed away. 
  The group pledged to our Palestinian people to continue its 
operations against the Zionist enemy until the land and man are 
liberated.

  [Text] The Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command, PFLP-GC, has issued a communique 
subsequent to the military communique it issued on the martyrs 
of the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque operation that was carried out by 
the PFLP-GC's commandos on 21 March 1994. Based on information 
from commandos who returned from the operation, the communique 
confirms that the operation against the enemy forces targeted 15 
Zionist paratroopers and infantrymen from the Engineering Corps. 
  The communique says: When the enemy patrol arrived at the 
controlled area, our comrades detonated two explosive devices 
that resulted in the wounding of all of the patrol's personnel. 
Afterwards, our comrades ambushed the enemy patrol and showered 
them with bullets, grenades, and rockets. They took full 
control of the situation in which the enemy soldiers could not 
fire a single bullet. Afterwards, fatal bullets were fired at 
the enemy soldiers who ran away, trampling over their comrades' 
heads. 
  More than 30 minutes later, the Zionist enemy sent out 
military rescue teams to the scene of the battle in order to 
remove the bodies of their soldiers. The enemy also sent out 
its tanks and infantry rescue teams to surround and chase our 
comrades. However, a number of antitank and antipersonnel mines 
blew up in the faces of the enemy forces, which further 
increased the enemy's losses. 
  The enemy admitted that two noncommissioned officers [NCO's] 
were killed and that three of its soldiers were wounded. As it 
always does, the enemy tries to hide the number of its losses 
for well-known political and moral reasons. Then it attributes 
the killing of their soldiers to road accidents and other 
reasons. 
  The communique continues to say: Hours after the 
al-'Ayshiyah operation, the enemy radio announced that a truck 
turned over, killing two soldiers and injuring three others. It 
later announced that three of its soldiers were injured when a 
missile exploded by mistake in the same area as the operation. 
Hours before that, it was announced that an NCO died of his 
wounds. 
  We, in the PFLP-GC, stress that the enemy's losses exceed 15 
soldiers and tanks--which like to kill women and children, to 
perpetrate massacres against our defenseless civilians inside 
Palestine, and to barbarically shell southern Lebanon and the 
camps inside it. 
  Through the operations carried out in the past few days, it 
has been proven that the occupation army is unable to face the 
mujahidin on the battlefield and that it quickly collapses amid 
the crying and screaming of its soldiers. 
  On this brave operation carried out by our heroic comrades 
in 
broad daylight, and in view of the sacrifices of our people 
inside occupied territories and the strikes by the national and 
Islamic resistances, we, in the PFLP-GC, reaffirm that the 
option of confrontation and jihad for the sake of liberation and 
of ousting the Zionist invaders is our one only option. We also 
reaffirm that the treasonous and capitulatory agreements in Oslo 
and Cairo will vanish. Moreover, this will also be the fate of 
the one who signed these agreements as this is the fate of all 
the treasonous ones in the history of the struggling nations. 
The massacres being perpetrated against our people inside the 
occupied territories will only add to our strength, solidity, 
and determination to continue the jihad until the liberation of 
land and man.

  In a statement, the joint PFLP-DFLP command added that, 
therefore, Washington is not qualified to play a neutral role in 
settling the Arab-Israeli dispute. It called on all concerned 
Arab parties to end the current talks because the U.S. position 
undermines the pillars of the peace process.

<F P=106> [By Riyad Mansur in Amman] </F>
  [Text] The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
[PFLP] has set three basic conditions for 'Arafat's continuing 
as PLO leader in accordance with a national consensus. 
  Speaking on behalf of the George Habash-led PFLP, Political 
Bureau member 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh said the conditions are: 
admitting failure in assuming his political and national 
responsibilities, renouncing the Oslo and Cairo agreements, and 
apologizing to the Palestinian people. 
  Malluh, who represented the PFLP in the PLO Executive 
Committee before he withdrew to protest the Madrid conference, 
told SAWT AL-SHA'b that if 'Arafat fails to meet these 
conditions he should leave the leadership immediately. 
  Malluh said 'Arafat now has a last chance to respond to the 
conditions of the Palestinian national forces, adding that while 
there is still time left to carry out these conditions, this 
time is narrowing day after day. 
  Malluh said the Palestinian opposition is now more confident 
of its position now, noting that what is taking place in the 
occupied territory belies the miserable option of the PLO's 
negotiating wing. 
  While expressing the Palestinian opposition's confidence in 
its position, Malluh strongly criticized it for its inability to 
unify its forces on joint issues and voiced regret for the 
absence of a unified strategy for these forces. 
  Malluh said that despite the failure to unify the opposition 
forces, there is a joint political base represented by 
opposition to the Oslo and Cairo agreements and the need to 
continue the intifadah and the struggle against the occupation. 
  Answering a question, Malluh said the democratic forces have 
many concerns and that the two fronts' [PFLP and the Democratic 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine] joint leadership has a 
unified strategy to face the dangers of the imposed settlement, 
which is threatening the national cause with liquidation.

  [Text] The minister of petroleum resources, Chief Don 
Etiebet, has assured Nigerians that the decision of OPEC not to 
cut oil production would not adversely affect this year's 
budget. He gave the assurance in Geneva, Switzerland, yesterday 
while answering questions from newsmen shortly after the 12th 
meeting of the Ministerial Monitoring Committee of the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. From Geneva, 
energy correspondent Alex Udoh reports on the outcome of the 
meeting: 
  [Begin recording] [Udoh] In a communique issued at the end 
of 
their meeting, the ministers decided to maintain the present 
overall production ceiling of 24.52 million barrels of crude oil 
per day for the remaining part of the year 1994. In doing so, 
they pledged strict adherence to their individual allocated 
production levels of last year. The OPEC ministers said they 
would not tolerate any violation of the agreement, pointing out 
that necessary sanctions would be imposed on defaulting member 
countries. 
  Briefing newsmen after the meeting, the minister of 
petroleum 
and mineral resources, Chief Don Etiebet, said Nigeria was in 
support of the decision reached at the meeting. Chief Etiebet 
said although Nigeria favored a cut in production as a means to 
firm up oil prices, that could not be borne in isolation. Chief 
Etiebet, however, gave detailed explanations on why the decision 
will not affect Nigeria's present budget. 
  [Etiebet] [passage indistinct] 
  [Udoh] Chief Etiebet stated that Nigeria had a [words 
indistinct] system to maintain a production quota of 1.85 
million barrels per day of crude oil allocated to it. [end

  [Text] Geneva, March 26 (AFP) [dateline as received] -- The 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is 
considering moving its headquarters from Vienna to Geneva, an 
OPEC source said Sunday [27 March]. 
  The source, seeking to clarify conflicting reports in the 
Swiss and Austrian press, said rumours arose because "we want to 
have our own headquarters" after 29 years in rented premises in 
Vienna. 
  As a result of the rumours, Geneva authorities contacted 
OPEC 
with an offer to provide a site for 90 years and help finance 
construction of a headquarters near the United Nations 
institutions here, the source explained. 
  OPEC's secretariat was initially based in Geneva, but was 
moved to Vienna in 1965 because the Canton of Geneva refused to 
grant it diplomatic privileges in line with those of UN 
facilities here. 
  Qatar meanwhile also said it would offer "everything you 
want" if the headquarters was moved to the tiny Gulf state, the 
source said. 
  The source said Austria, which draws economic benefits of an 
estimated 50 million dollars a year from OPEC's presence in 
Vienna, in turn reacted by offering OPEC new terms. 
  "The situation is still fluid," the source added, saying a 
written proposal from the Austrians was expected to be discussed 
by OPEC ministers at their summer conference in Vienna around 
mid-June.

  [Excerpts] Head of State Lamine Zeroual is continuing his 
meetings with the various political parties, national figures, 
and social and economic organizations. Following the statement 
issued yesterday by a political party that indicated that the 
leaders of the dissolved Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] were to 
participate in the current national dialogue, a source close to 
the presidency said that this matter was related to a biased 
interpretation of the content of Zeroual's talks with the 
various parties that he has received to date. 
  The same source recalled the content of the statement issued 
by the presidency on 18 March on the eve of the resumption of 
the national dialogue. [passage omitted] 
  It is worth mentioning that Head of State Lamine Zeroual has 
met to date with the National Liberation Front [FLN], the 
Movement for Democracy in Algeria, the Islamic Society 
Movement-Hamas, the Ennahda Movement, and the Party of Algerian 
Renewal [PRA].

  [Text] A statement by the Islamic Society Movement, Hamas, 
said that a delegation of the movement, headed by Mr. Mahfoud 
Nahnah, was received yesterday by Mr. Lamine Zeroual, head of 
state. 
  The statement of Hamas considered the meeting as a 
preparation for future practical meetings. It also said that 
the meeting was characterized with frankness. 
  The statement added that the delegation reached an agreement 
that the aim of the transitional period was to return to the 
election stage, and that the dialogue would continue and would 
include the leadership of the dissolved FIS [Islamic Salvation 
Front] within the framework of respecting the constitution and 
renouncing violence. 
  This was the statement of Hamas. 
  However, sources close to the presidency pointed out that 
the 
text of the statement in the part related to the participation 
of the dissolved FIS in the current national dialogue was 
nothing more than an interpretation -- used for political aims 
-- of the message conveyed by Lamine Zeroual to the various 
personalities he received until now. 
  As far as the dialogue was concerned, the source close to 
the 
presidency recalled, it would take place within the framework of 
the statement issued on 18 March.

  [Text] Algiers, March 29 (AFP)--President Lamine Zeroual 
has said the government has made "contacts" with the Islamic 
Salvation Front (FIS), in an effort to form a transitional forum 
among the country's political parties. 
  According to a statement sent to AFP Monday evening by the 
opposition leftist Ettahaddi party, the president stressed that 
the "government is now waiting for the FIS to keep its promise 
to stop terrorism." 
  The statement did not say what the government may have 
promised the FIS, which it officially banned in January 1992 
after the army intervened to cancel a general election the FIS 
looked poised to win. 
  Government dialogue with the banned party has been a point 
of 
controversy in recent days, since the Islamic Society Movement 
(MSI) released a statement, which the government contested, 
implying that FIS leaders were talking with the government. The 
MSI is a moderate Islamist rival of the FIS. 
  According to Ettahaddi, Zeroual "assured that dialogue (with 
political parties) would not be exclusive," but that he would 
"leave out any who attack the constitution." He also said that 
the government would not discuss anything that "is not 
negotiable." 
  The goal of the talks, which began last Wednesday, is to 
form 
a National Transition Council. The proposed body would have 200 
members representing political parties, the government, unions 
and professional organisations. 
  The organisation would be a quasi-legislative body in which 
the FIS would occupy around 40 seats. The council is scheduled 
to get underway by the end of April.

  [Text] Continuing the national dialogue, the head of state, 
Mr. Lamine Zeroual, received during the past two days a FLN 
[National Liberation Front] party delegation led by Mr. 
Abdelhamid Mehri, the party's secretary general; he also 
received the leader of the Ettahadi movement Mr. Hachemi Cherif. 
Here are more details from Zohra Zemit. 
  [Zemit] At the meeting which brought together the head of 
state and the FLN party delegation, the latter conveyed to the 
head of state a letter of proposals on the means for making the 
national dialogue successful and overcoming the current 
political crisis. 
  The letter, a copy of which was received by the radio today, 
has pointed out that the chances, albeit very small, for making 
the national dialogue a success were still there. The letter 
hoped that the national dialogue, called for by the head of 
state, would not be another missed opportunity. Consequently, 
the letter added, that the FLN political bureau believed that 
the state, represented in the person of Mr. Lamine Zeroual, was 
called upon to take firm measures which would create chances for 
making such a dialogue a success, and would bring about a 
political relaxation which would allow the people as well as the 
rest of political and social forces to continue the dialogue, to 
get involved in it, and to prepare themselves to accept its 
outcome. 
  The letter pointed out, furthermore, that the people were 
called upon this year to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1 
November revolution and to be loyal to such a great revolution. 
The latter would require, however, the generation which fought 
it, including the head of state Lamine Zeroual, to mobilize 
itself to put an end to the confrontation between the Algerians, 
which has nearly blown away everything such a revolution has 
achieved. 
  The letter concluded by asserting that the FLN political 
bureau was convinced that a serious and a profound dialogue 
between all Algerians, without any seclusion, would bring back 
hope to the people and would overcome the serious and 
complicated problems which have been threatening the country's 
stability, security, progress and independence. 
  The Ettahaddi movement has issued a statement today, after 
its Coordinator Mr. Hachemi Cherif was received by the head of 
state Lamine Zeroual, in which it stressed its known stances 
towards the situation and the ways to deal with the crisis. 
With regard to the latter, it considers that redrawing the 
political map and the emergence of a new political class, on the 
basis of the project of modernization, were a pressing need for 
bringing about the rupture with all the methods and practices of 
the past. 
  The Ettahaddi movement considered that the transition 
leading 
to a modern state of law compelled the country to embark upon 
radical structural reforms. This need goes hand in hand with 
the complete elimination of terrorism and fighting extremism 
relentlessly on all fronts, in the society and the institutions 
of the republic.

  [Text] The FLN [National Liberation Front] has sent a 
message to Lamine Zeroual, the head of state, in which it says 
that it rules out participation in any nominal dialogue, but 
remains committed to serious and deep dialogue with those who 
represent the authority of the state and all effective political 
forces. 
  The FLN said that the invitation of parties that emerged 
through the latest elections, regardless of differences, to a 
joint and open meeting was pressing and urgent. This was an 
excerpt of the message addressed by the FLN to the head of state.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The security services have 
announced also that a 41-old Russian national, Konstantin 
Kokoshin, was murdered in Saoula in Tipaza province. The

car, which belonged to the Russian embassy, parked at a bus 
station at Saoula. 
  The security services have added that their investigation 
following the discovery of the murder have enabled them to 
eliminate four armed elements and to recover three automatic 
revolvers and a sawn-off shotgun.

and the foreign ministry official, who was murdered at Bourdj el 
Kiffan this morning.

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Mar (MENA)--The Egyptian National 
Progressive Unionist Grouping Party has warned against lifting 
the Arab boycott on Israel. 
  A statement issued today by the party's Central Secretariat 
says that with the continued Israeli occupation of the 
Palestinian and Arab territories and the ongoing Israeli 
policies of settlement building and violence, oppression, and 
killing against the Palestinian people, the boycott is the only 
remaining weapon in the hands of Arabs and Palestinians. 
  The statement says that the Arab League's involvement in 
lifting any part of the boycott against Israel at this time, 
before a just and a comprehensive peace is achieved, will 
represent a harsh judgment on the future of the Arab League and 
on the conduct of Arab governments.

  [Text] Cairo, 28 Mar (MENA)--'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi, a 
dissident element from the terrorist al-Shawqiyun group, has 
exposed the corrupt thought of the extremist terrorist groups 
that have misled many youths under false claims not consistent 
with the Islamic religion's teachings. 
  'Abd-al-Baqi described these extremist terrorist groups as 
"a 
band of thieves, criminals, and mercenaries who use religion as 
a cover for their acts and who claim that differences among them 
mainly revolve around the interpretation of the shar'iah. 
  In an interview with Egyptian television last night, 
'Abd-al-Baqi, 33, who was born in al-Fayyum, related his bitter 
experience with the various elements of terrorism and extremism 
over 17 years spent moving from one governorate to another 
calling for extremist thought and recruiting many youths. He 
said his relationship with the terrorist groups began in 1977. 
He was exercising in a sports hall inside a mosque in 
al-Fayyum. Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman was chairman of a 
charitable society affiliated with the mosque. He then became 
acquainted with the members of this society with the aim of 
understanding Islam and studying religious issues. 
  Repentant 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi related his relationship with 
Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, describing him as a "dissolute 
preacher and power hungry." 'Abd-al-Rahman would answer 
questions without submitting evidence or proof. Most of his 
fatwas were governed by personal whims. He claimed that he was 
infallible and would issue orders without explaining who vested 
this authority in him. 
  'Abd-al-Baqi noted that on joining these groups he was 
affected by several books he read, including one entitled "The 
Four Terms" by al-Mawdudi and another entitled "Rules of 
Propagation," which calls for seizing funds by force and by any 
other means. After reading this book, he began carrying out 
armed robberies of jewelry shops, stealing cars, dismantling 
them, and selling them as spare parts. He explained that he 
adopted terrorism after reading a book entitled "Milestones" by 
Sayyid Qutb. He said the books calls for changing the regime by 
force. 
  'Abd-al-Baqi said he recruited many youths and inculcated 
them with corrupt ideas. These youths later became leaders of 
terrorist operations. They included Muhammad al-Aswani, Khamis 
Muslim, and Muhammad Sa'd, who carried out assassinations, armed 
robberies of jewelry shops, and attacks on Central Security 
Forces camps. 
  'Abd-al-Baqi explained that it was very easy to recruit 
youths because they were prepared for this and had no legal or 
religious background. It was easy to influence them. 
  He said that mingling with the terrorist groups he noticed 
that marriages within the groups took place haphazardly. These 
marriages were documented solely for security reasons, not 
because this was an important religious duty. He explained that 
some of these groups used to blaspheme [takfir] husbands to 
separate them from their wives who would then be forced to join 
these groups and marry group members. He noted that some wives 
would marry more than once without the knowledge of their first 
husbands who were declared blasphemous. The marriage would 
sometimes take place a few days after the wife got a divorce and 
without waiting for the legal three-month period. 
  Repentant extremist 'Abd-al-Baqi said in his interview with 
Egyptian television that the terrorist groups have nothing to do 
with religion. He described the members of the so-called 
al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [Islamic Group] as having no religion or 
morals. He said that members of the al-Shawqiyun Organization 
are a group of thieves and criminals and of the al-Takfir Group 
[Repudiation and Renunciation] are a group of immoral people who 
commit adultery and prostitution under the cover of Islam. 
  'Abd-al-Baqi then discussed the financing of these groups. 
He said it took place through armed robbery. The money netted 
from these robberies was spent on members to meet their housing 
and marriage needs. 
  He also noted that weapons were stolen from village houses 
in 
Lower and Upper Egypt. 
  'Abd-al-Baqi said the purpose of making his confession is to 
expose these groups and show the falsehood of their ideas. He 
added: We found no one to correct our ideas so we stuck to our 
false beliefs.

  [Text] The Egyptian film "The Terrorist" has created 
sensitivity and often bickering outside Egypt, because it deals 
with a very controversial topic, the Islamic fundamentalist 
movement. 
  In Egypt, the confrontation between the regime and the 
"Islamists," while not reaching the level of violence witnessed 
in Algeria, has assumed greater dimensions to include every 
level, including the cinema, television, and arts in general. 
  In addition to the scenes of commotion and pandemonium in 
the 
streets surrounding the nine movie theaters that began screening 
the film a week ago, Interior Minister Major General Hasan 
al-Alfi has announced that new television serials will be 
screened soon in which "repentant" Islamists will denounce the 
"corruption of the extremist thought." 
  Acting on a presidential decision, the Egyptian authorities 
have banned Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Kafi from delivering sermons at 
Asad Ibn-Furat Mosque in al-Duqqi [a Cairo suburb]. The 
Egyptian authorities placed the mosque under the supervision of 
the Ministry of Awqaf and banned Shaykh 'Abd-al-Kafi from 
travelling. 
  Shaykh 'Abd-al-Kafi was behind the campaign to persuade 
movie 
and theater actresses to wear the veil. A secular campaign 
against him has increased his popularity such that thousands of 
people pray behind him every week. 
  The security forces surrounded Asad Ibn-al-Furat on Friday 
[18 March]. The worshippers were surprised to see the director 
of al-Awqaf in al-Jizah ascending the pulpit to deliver the 
Friday sermon. 
  A colonel from the State Security Intelligence Department 
went to the house of Shaykh 'Abd-al-Kafi and informed him of the 
presidential decision to ban him from delivering sermons or 
giving religious classes at that mosque or any other. 
  The day before yesterday Maj. Gen. al-Alfi declared: "Many 
of these Islamists have understood the false calls of the 
extremist terrorist elements and have returned to society to 
resume their life in a normal way." He promised to screen 
recorded television interviews with some of the "repenters." 
  Egyptian state television has given Muslim religious men the 
chance to appear on its screen. A few weeks ago, it began 
screening a program criticizing the ideas and practices of the 
"extremist" Islamists. 
  Hasan al-Hillawi, a former Islamist leader, issued a 
statement the day before yesterday calling on the extremist 
organizations to abandon terrorism. 
  The film "The Terrorist" was written by well-known novelist 
Lenin al-Ramli and was directed by Nadir Jalal. The main role 
is played by popular comedian 'Adil Imam. 
  The streets surrounding the nine Cairo movie theaters that 
began screening the film a week ago have witnessed scenes of 
commotion and congestion. These movie theaters have witnessed 
pandemonium among the audience. 
  The security forces have imposed a tight guard on these 
movie 
houses in case they are targeted for attack by the Islamic 
groups. The film, its title, theme, and action, rejects Islamic 
group acts. Film analysts say the film earned $200,000 during 
the first three days of its screening, a record figure for the 
Egyptian film industry. 
  The film is accompanied by a large adverstising campaign, 
which includes huge placards showing the "terrorist" 'Adil Imam 
bearded and carrying a pistol.

  [Excerpt] The Aircraft Factory of the Arab 
Industrialization Organization has concluded a supplementary 
contract with the U.S. Lockheed Corporation, which manufactures 
the F-16 fighters, according to which more of the aircraft's 
parts will be manufactured in Egypt. The $21 million contract 
is valid for five years and is renewable. The initial and 
supplementary contracts provide for manufacturing parts for 80 
F-16's for Lockheed. 
  Last month, the Aircraft Factory began production of the 
equipment needed for manufacturing parts of the U.S. F-16's. 
Delivery of the first manufactured parts will begin early next

  [Text] The French foreign minister has spoken to Arab press 
correspondents in Paris about what is called the Lockerbie case, 
and called for what he termed specific measures in this respect. 
Commenting on this, JANA's international affairs editor says: 
The Great Jamahiriyah is the one that adopted the initiative and 
all the measures for the trial of the two suspects, the latest 
of which was when it called for the trial of the two suspects 
before the International Court of Justice in The Hague, and the 
implementation of the Montreal convention. 
  However, the western governments do not want such a trial 
because the two suspects are Libyans who have no case to answer, 
they are not accused of anything specific, and there is no 
evidence against them. If they are tried in accordance with the 
law, the West will be exposed and the fallacy of their evidence 
will be confirmed. 
  The editor concludes: All the suggestions put forward by 
Libya in this respect are specific and practical suggestions.

  [Text] Libya demanded the implementation of the agreement 
it signed with Chad in 1989 in the Algerian capital on the Aozou 
Strip and at the same time affirmed its intention to withdraw 
from that strip. 
  The agreement stipulates for the exchange of POW's following 
the war which broke out between the two countries over the Aozou 
Strip. 
  The Libyan foreign affairs minister affirmed his country's 
compliance with the decision of the International Court of 
Justice, which acknowledged Chad's claim over the Aozou Strip. 
  The Libyan official said in a letter he sent to the UN 
secretary general that Libya did not object to the decision and 
had no prior or subsequent conditions. 
  The Libyan foreign affairs minister mentioned that his 
country was only interested in reaching a final settlement to 
the Aozou Strip by peaceful means and logical practices. He 
said that required the implementation of the Algiers agreement. 
  The Libyan official pointed out that Chad insisted on 
obtaining a timetable on the withdrawal of the Libyan civilian 
and military administration from the Aozou Strip before studying 
the preparation of a mechanism for implementing and setting up 
committees for this purpose. 
  It is worth mentioning that the talks which started between 
the two sides since the beginning of this month have brought no 
results whatsoever.

  [Text] Paris, March 27 (AFP) -- Libya is pledged to comply 
with a court order to quit the disputed Aouzou Strip, but wants 
the Organisation of African Unity [OAU] to supervise the 
pullout, Libya's foreign secretary told AFP Saturday [27 March]. 
  Sa'd Mujbir [an official of the Libyan parliament] said 
Libya 
had accepted the February 3 ruling by the International Court of 
Justice in The Hague in favour of Chad's territorial claims to 
the Aouzou Strip, which Libya has occupied for the past 20 years. 
  "There's no question of reneging," he said. "But we want to 
withdraw within the rules in such a way as to avoid future 
conflict, preserving the dignity of all parties." 
  He said the OAU should act fast to supervise the withdrawal, 
saying Libya had asked current OAU chairman Egypt to put 
together a team of observers to carry out the task. 
  He rejected claims by Ndjamena that Libya was setting 
preconditions for a withdrawal, and denied that Libya was 
sending reinforcements to the territory.

  [Text] Cairo, March 27 (AFP) -- Violent protests broke out 
in a Libyan town after calls for the execution of 55 army 
officers linked to a rebellion, an opposition leader said here 
Sunday. 
  Guards shot and wounded several protesters who smashed and 
set fire to public buildings on March 17 in Bani Walid, about 
150 kilometers (90 miles) southeast of Tripoli, Muhammad Fayiz 
Jibril told AFP. 
  Protests erupted after Libyan television broadcast "false 
confessions extracted under torture from army officers" 
implicated in last October's rebellion in Bani Walid, said 
Jibril, Cairo representative for the Libyan National Salvation 
Front. 
  "Members of the Libyan regime called for the execution of 
these officers, who admitted under torture to being agents of 
the United States. Bani Walid residents were outraged over the 
call for executions and the use of torture," he said. 
  "The residents then smashed and set fire to the offices of 
the revolutionary and information committees" set up by 
al-Qadhdhafi, he said. 
  "Agents of the revolutionary committees holed up in the 
offices opened fire on the demonstrators, wounding several of 
them," he added. 
  Jibril asked Arab League Secretary General 'Ismat 
'Abd-al-Majid and Arab foreign ministers meeting in the Egyptian 
capital to intervene to prevent al-Qadhdhafi from "executing the 
55 officers."

March in Bani Walid, 150 km south of Tripoli, after they 
attacked public buildings. According to this opposition leader, 
the demonstrations broke out after Libyan television broadcast

  According to the director of Libya's foreign information 
service, the claims of this opposition leader are hardly 
credible, given his collaboration with foreign information 
services, in particular the CIA.

Be Toughened Next Month"] 
  [Excerpt] Cairo, AL-HAYAH -- Dr. Madani Abu-al-Duwayrat, 
representative of the Libyan Solidarity Committee, has 
criticized the continuation of the economic embargo imposed on 
his country. He said that Libya responded to UN Security Council 
Resolution 731 and made "numerous initiatives" to end the 
Lockerbie issue, "but the United States and France continue to 
adopt the policy of escalation against Libya." 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH in Cairo, Abu-al-Duwayrat 
expected 
sanctions against his country to be toughened in April so as to 
include the freezing of Libyan assets abroad and a ban on oil 
imports. He said that toughening the sanctions would not cause 
Libya to change its position "or abandon its sovereignty." He 
pointed out that his country has expressed willingness to secure 
a "fair trial" for the two suspects in the case of the U.S. 
plane blown up over Lockerbie (Scotland in 1988). He urged the 
Western states to "return the problem to its legal character, 
instead of politicizing it." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, was given a 
warm welcome when she flew into Muscat on a three-day official 
visit to Oman. Special representative of Sultan Qabus, (Sa'id 
Ghoyn Bin-Shahab al-Sa'id) greeted the prime minister and 
members of the entourage at Muscat airport. National anthems of 
the two countries were played. The prime minister inspected a 
guard of honor. A large number of dignitaries present to 
welcome her were introduced to the prime minister. 
  Later, the leaders of the two countries had informal chat at 
the VVIP [Very Very Important Person] room of the airport. In a 
statement, the prime minister said Pakistan regards Oman as an 
important neighbor with whom it has traditionally enjoyed close 
and cordial relations based on history, common religion, 
cultural heritage, convergence of perception on major regional 
and international issues, and mutually beneficial cooperation in 
all fields. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said she will brief Sultan Qabus 
Bin Sa'id on recent developments in our region and drew his 
attention to the latest situation in Kashmir. Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto said bilateral relations between Pakistan and Oman are 
progressing steadily for the mutual benefit of our two 
countries. She hoped that her visit will be instrumental in 
giving impetus to our relations and shall lay a base for 
accelerated cooperation in many spheres. 
  Pakistan Television's correspondent Abdul Khaleq Sargarna 
said during the talks between Sultan Qabus and Prime Minister 
Ms. Benazir Bhutto, relations with the Gulf countries, the 
Central Asian Republics and the possibility of cooperation 
between the Economic Cooperation Organization -- ECO -- and the 
Gulf countries are also expected to come up for discussion.

  [Text] Pakistan and Oman have called for an early solution 
to the Kashmir problem and an end to the human rights violations 
in occupied Kashmir. During detailed discussions in Salalah on 
a wide range of issues, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Omani 
Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id reviewed the latest situations in 
occupied Kashmir, Afghanistan, Palestine, and Bosnia, and 
reacted strongly to the atrocities being committed by Indian 
forces against the innocent Kashmiris. Expressing serious 
concern over the situation in Kashmir, Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id 
stressed the need for a solution to the Kashmir problem, which 
is in the best interests of both India and Pakistan. 
  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto apprised the Omani sultan of 
the latest situation in occupied Kashmir, saying Kashmir is the 
core issue between India and Pakistan and it needs to be 
resolved in accordance with the UN resolutions. As a first step 
in this direction, human rights violations in occupied Kashmir 
should be stopped to create a congenial atmosphere for 
meaningful negotiations. India, she said, should allow people 
from other countries to visit occupied Kashmir and assess the 
situation. The prime minister reiterated that an Islamic 
Conference Organization mission should be allowed to visit 
occupied Kashmir. 
  During the talks, Benazir Bhutto suggested a more frequent 
exchange of views between Pakistan and Oman on regional and 
international issues. The two countries should lay the 
foundations for wider economic cooperation because there are 
many areas in which they can increase cooperation. Potential 
areas of cooperation include the delimitation of the maritime 
boundary; defense production; a gas pipeline project; joint 
ventures to establish chemical fertilizer plants; a ferry 
service between Karachi, Gwadar, and Oman; and the export of 
manpower from Pakistan to Oman. 
  Radio Pakistan special correspondent Abdul Aziz Khan reports 
in his dispatch from Salalah that during their talks at the 
(Qasr-i al-Bosin), Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Sultan 
Qabus Bin-Sa'id discussed several agreements. The talks were 
held in the atmosphere of trust and goodwill that is 
traditionally found between the two neighboring countries. Our 
correspondent says the two leaders attached special importance 
to the expansion of fraternal relations between Pakistan and 
Oman and also reviewed the security arrangements in the Gulf and 
the current status of the Economic Cooperation Organization.

  [Text] At the invitation of the government of His Majesty 
Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id, Her Excellency Mrs. Benazir Bhutto, 
prime minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, paid an 
official visit to the Sultanate during the period 26-28 March

Khan, minister of petroleum and natural resources; His

and senior officials. 
  The prime minister was accorded a warm and hospitable 
reception that mirrors the spirit of the sincere and strong 
brotherhood between the two countries connected by ties of 
religion, history, and culture. 
  His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id received Her Excellency 
Prime Minister Mrs. Benazir Bhutto and held lengthy talks on 
strengthening bilateral ties. Sultan Qabus and Mrs. Bhutto 
exchanged views regarding regional and international issues of 
mutual interest, including Kashmir, Palestine, and Bosnia. 
  The two sides paid special attention to the situation in 
Jammu and Kashmir and asserted the need to find ways to hold 
talks to resolve the conflict over Kashmir in accordance with 
the aspirations and desires of the people of Kashmir. The two 
sides noted the need to provide an appropriate atmosphere and 
circumstance for purposeful talks. 
  The two sides reviewed the peace process in the Middle East 
after condemning the Hebron incident. They expressed their 
continuous support for the Middle East peace talks. The two 
sides denounced the Hebron massacre and expressed the hope that 
such events will not obstruct the progress of the Middle East 
peace process. The two sides expressed the need to settle the 
Middle East problem in accordance with the Security Council 
resolutions and called for complete protection for the

their legitimate right to self-defense. The two sides called 
for urgent measures to protect the sovereignty and territorial 
integrity of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as for 
humanitarian and development aid to end the suffering of the 
people in that friendly country. 
  A number of ministers and ranking officials in the 
Sultanate met with the prime minister, exchanged views with her, 
and discussed ways and methods to give momentum to joint 
cooperation in the service of both countries. Official talks 
were also held to discuss the various aspects of cooperation 
between the two countries under the chairmanship of His 
Excellency Maqbul Bin-'Ali Bin-Sultan, minister of trade and 
industry, and His Excellency Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, Pakistani 
minister of foreign affairs. The talks were attended on the

  Pakistan and the Sultanate agreed to work together to 
strengthen regional cooperation for peace and security. In 
order to reach understanding on bilateral, regional, and 
international issues, the two countries agreed to hold bilateral 
political consultations at least once a year on the level of the 
foreign ministers, with meetings alternating between Muscat and

<F P=106> [Report on a news conference held by Pakistani Prime </F>
Minister Benazir Bhutto in Muscat on 28 March; from the 
"Correspondents' Dispatches" program; passages within quotation 
marks in English] 
  [Text] Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto left the 
Sultanate today following a three-day visit, during which she 
held talks with His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id, may God 
preserve him, and with the officials in the Sultanate. 
Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto held a news conference 
today, the last day of her visit, before her departure. During 
the news conference she spoke about the results of her visit to 
the country, as well as other regional and international issues. 
At the outset of the news conference, the Pakistani prime 
minister expressed her sincerest appreciation for His Majesty 
Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id, may God watch over him, and for the 
Omani people, for the warm welcome and hospitality she and her 
delegation were accorded during their visit to the country. 
  "I'd like to start by expressing my appreciation to his 
majesty, the government, and the people of Oman, for giving us 
such a warm welcome during the visit to your country." 
  The prime minister said that her visit to the country is of 
a 
special significance, because we, in Pakistan, attach special 
importance to our relations with the Sultanate, especially since 
the Sultanate and Pakistan are geographically close to each 
other, in addition to the fact that they have historical 
relations, she added. 
  Regarding her talks with His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id, 
Mrs. Bhutto said: 
  "While I was here in Oman I had the opportunity of not only 
discussing the areas that there can be economic cooperation, but 
also hearing his majesty on the world situation and the regional 
situation." 
  The prime minister said: My visit to the Sultanate was not 
only to discuss economic relations, but also to hear his 
majesty's views on the international situation in general, and 
the regional situation in particular. 
  Mrs. Bhutto added that she had discussed with his majesty 
the 
situation in Jammu and Kashmir, and that she had briefed him on 
Pakistan's stand toward the issue, and on her country's call for 
reaching a peaceful settlement of this crisis through 
international means. The two sides also discussed the Afghan 
issue, the Yugoslav crisis, and the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Mrs. Bhutto said that his majesty briefed her on the 
situation in this region, that she felt that the visit was very 
useful to her, and that this visit will be followed by other 
visits on the ministerial level. 
  Mrs. Bhutto invited his majesty to visit Pakistan where he 
will be received with the same warm welcome and hospitality from 
the Pakistani people.

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto says Pakistan 
cannot close its eyes to developments taking place in Kashmir 
and this is the right time for a solution to this problem 
because Kashmir has now turned into Asia's Bosnia. Addressing a 
crowded news conference in Muscat before her departure for home 
at the conclusion of her three-day visit to Oman, she said the 
problem should be resolved in accordance with international law 
and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people. Bhutto said she 
also briefed Sultan Qabus on the situation that has arisen on 
the Indian subcontinent as a result of the Jammu and Kashmir 
problem. She also informed Sultan Qabus of the selective 
tyranny and oppression carried out against the people during the 
struggle in occupied Kashmir. 
  The prime minister thanked Oman for its support to Pakistan 
on the Kashmir problem and also requested Sultan Qabus to assist 
in lessening tension in the subcontinent because Oman has good 
relations with India. She urged the Sultan to persuade India to 
stop human rights violations and strive for a political 
settlement of this issue. Bhutto added it is regrettable that 
India is not only criticizing her government but also attacking 
her personally, which reflects that the present government has 
perturbed India on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, which was not 
done by any previous Government of Pakistan. The prime minister 
said she held negotiations on Jammu and Kashmir with complete 
firmness, because Pakistan is really interested in the 
establishment of peace and stability in Jammu and Kashmir and 
believes that the time is ripe for settling this issue in 
accordance with the aspirations of the Kashmiri people. She 
said we have struggled for human rights in Pakistan, and, hence, 
we cannot overlook the developments taking place in Jammu and 
Kashmir. We cannot close our eyes to the fact that 600,000 
Indian troops are stationed in Jammu and Kashmir. India has 
increased its defense budget by 20 percent within a span of one 
year, which is directly related to the attempts to crush the 
struggle going on in occupied Kashmir. Pakistan cannot also 
ignore the fact that women are being molested in occupied 
Kashmir. 
  The prime minister described her visit to Oman as very 
fruitful and expressed the hope that her visit will lead to 
exchange of visits at the ministerial levels. The two countries 
have the potential to work together to meet the requirements of 
the Pakistani markets and of the Gulf and Central Asian markets. 
  Benazir Bhutto apprised the Omani Sultan of Pakistan's 
defense capabilities and said the two countries can find new 
avenues of cooperation in this field. She announced a gift of 
three Mashshaq trainer aircraft to Oman as an expression of the 
gesture of friendship. Later, addressing a large number of 
leading businessmen, the prime minister said Oman is the closest 
neighbor of Pakistan which offers vast opportunities for 
investment. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Pakistan and Oman have affirmed the necessity of 
finding ways for meaningful negotiations to solve the Kashmir 
dispute in accordance with the wishes of the Kashmiri people. 
In a joint statement issued at the end of the three-day 
official visit of the prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, to 
Oman, the two sides also stressed the need for creating the 
right environment and condition for meaningful talks to resolve 
the problem. The prime minister and Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id held 
in-depth discussions on strengthening bilateral relations and 
shared views on regional and international issues of common 
interest and concern, including Kashmir, Palestine, and Bosnia. 
  The two sides expressed their continued support for the 
Middle East peace negotiations, condemned the al-Khalil 
incident, and hoped that the peace process in the Middle East 
would not be hampered by such incidents. They called for full 
protection of Palestinians in the occupied Arab territories. 
About Bosnia, Pakistan and Oman called for urgent measures to 
protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as humanitarian and relief measures 
to alleviate the sufferings of the people of that fraternal 
country. 
  The statement says the ministers of the two countries 
exchanged views and examined ways for advancing bilateral 
cooperation for mutual interest and benefit of their people. 
The two countries agreed to work together for promoting 
regional cooperation in the interests of peace and security. 
They agreed to sign agreements in several fields for 
cooperation. One such agreement for cooperation between Oman 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Federation of Pakistan 
Chambers of Commerce and Industry was already signed. 
  The prime minister conveyed the invitation of the president 
of Pakistan to Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id to pay a state visit which 
was accepted by the sultan.

Participate in Meeting Hosted by Muscat"] 
  [Excerpt] Muscat -- Well-informed Omani sources have 
confirmed to AL-HAYAH that the Omani Government has officially 
sent an invitation to the Israeli Government to attend the 
upcoming meeting of the water committee arising from the 
multilateral negotiations, scheduled to be held in Muscat on 17 
April. 
  The sources said that the invitations have been sent to 
Israel and the other states participating in the committee's 
proceedings, in accordance with the tradition pursued in the 
Madrid formula, which stipulated that the invitation should be 
sent by the state hosting the meeting and the cosponsors of the 
peace conference (United States and Russia). The sources told 
AL-HAYAH that Israel has also been invited among a limited and 
select group of states to attend a preliminary meeting at expert 
level to be held in Muscat on 5 April. 
  The sources pointed out that Israel was among the states 
that 
participated in the researches and proposals which the Sultanate 
of Oman had been assigned to prepare within a comprehensive 
study on ways of developing sea water desalination technology. 
The experts meeting will meet to discuss the stage the study 
has reached so far. The sources said that this "distinguished" 
participation by Israel and other states in the region, 
especially neighboring Arab states like Egypt, Jordan, and the 
Palestinians, is a natural thing because these parties are 
closely concerned with the issues to be discussed. [passage

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ahmad Jabir 'Afif, member of the </F>
Yemeni Political Forces Dialogue Committee, in Aden, by 
political affairs correspondent Salim 'Ali Dhiyab, in the 
studio, on 28 March -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Dhiyab] Mr. Ahmad, the Yemeni Council of Ministers 
met in Aden yesterday. Can you shed some light on the results 
of this meeting? 
  ['Afif] First of all, I would like to thank you, especially 
His Majesty King Husayn and the people and Government of 
fraternal Jordan for following the situation in Yemen. 
  In fact, the Council of Ministers met on Wednesday [23 
March] 
and today it is still in session. It made many decisions to 
implement the accord document, which was signed in fraternal 
Amman. The government is continuing its efforts in order to 
implement this document. The implementation is the government's 
responsibility. 
  [Dhiyab] How do you assess the work of the Jordanian-Omani 
military committee? 
  ['Afif] This committee, particularly the Jordanian team, 
carried out excellent work and is highly appreciated by all the 
sons of Yemen. I say this, because I feel that Major General 
'Id [head of the Jordanian team] and his team did good work with 
the joint military committee at many locations. Confrontations 
among the Armed Forces were prevented at many locations. In 
fact, the joint military committee exerted intensive efforts. A 
few days ago, I heard His Majesty King Husayn say upon his 
return to Amman from the Gulf that he still has much hope and 
optimism. Of course, his majesty is holding the people of Yemen 
responsible in this regard. However, Jordan, especially His 
Majesty King Husayn, continues to follow this issue because 
Amman is the Yemenis' final resort. 
  We hope that all the people of Yemen will implement this 
accord signed in Amman, and I frankly reiterate that all the 
people of Yemen admire and are proud of King Husayn and the 
Government and people of fraternal Jordan for their continued 
efforts and they will continue this work because the accord was 
signed in fraternal and great Amman.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with National Assembly Speaker Sa'di </F>
Mahdi Salih by Sami Kulayb in Paris; date not given] 
  [Text] The speaker of the Iraqi parliament, Sa'di Mahdi 
Salih, has affirmed that France, Russia, and China have changed 
their stances on Iraq. He said that the United States is 
adamantly adhering to its current stance for political reasons, 
which are supported by some Arab countries, and economic reasons 
stemming from the fear of Baghdad's return to the oil market. 
He pointed out that Iraqi authorities have implemented all the 
international resolutions, including the recognition of Kuwait. 
He accused Kurdish leader Mas'ud Barzani of working for 
Washington's interests. 
  AL-SAFIR met Salih in Paris, where he was heading the Iraqi 
parliamentary delegation to the 19th conference of the 
International Parliamentary Union held at UNESCO headquarters 
and attended by parliamentarians from 125 countries, among them 
many Arabs countries, including Kuwait. This conference is 
usually dedicated to looking into issues of international 
interest, human rights, and bolstering democratic action. 
  During his speech, French President Francois Mitterrand 
stressed issues of work, environmental protection, and 
development. However, the Iraqi delegation, which is currently 
visiting Paris for the first time since the occupation of 
Kuwait, stressed other goals. Salih summarized these goals by 
explaining Iraq's viewpoint to the international forum and 
presenting the issue of major concern to Iraq: lifting the 
economic boycott. 
  [Kulayb] We learned that a meeting took place on the 
sidelines among the Arab parliamentarians. What were their 
stances on lifting the boycott? 
  [Salih] The Arab meeting took place on the sidelines of the 
international meeting. In general, activities during such 
meetings are restricted to coordinating stances that will be 
presented during the international conference. This is why 
these issues were discussed, and we reached an agreement on a 
way to bolster Arab issues and proposals, including lifting the 
boycott on Iraq. 
  [Kulayb] Much is being said about a change in the French 
stance regarding Iraq. Is this serious? 
  [Salih] I believe that it is serious; France headed those 
countries that demanded that the lifting of the siege of Iraq 
should be discussed in a new way, not in the usual way that 
always followed an American opinion. In short, this American 
formulation maintains that there is nothing new in Iraq's stance 
and, therefore, the boycott must continue. But now the French, 
Russian, and Chinese have rejected this argument. They believe 
that Iraq has implemented many of the resolutions and a new 
stance must be taken. I believe that this is a good beginning. 
  [Kulayb] What are the obstacles preventing the lifting of 
the boycott, just so long as Iraq has implemented all or most of 
the international resolutions? Is it American policy or the 
economy and Iraq's return to the oil market? 
  [Salih] Of course, the political stance is the main reasons. 
The Americans and their Arab allies want to achieve the 
objective they failed to achieve through the use of weapons, 
that is, changing the regime in Iraq. This in itself is a 
violation of the UN Charter and of the right of people to choose 
the regimes they want. We still believe that this is not a good 
policy and will not achieve any results. 
  The second factor is economic. The oil-producing countries 
oppose Iraq's return to the oil market because this would mean a 
new reduction in oil prices. This is selfish. The oil issue 
should be treated in accordance with quotas. Prices can be 
stabilized only when quotas are redistributed and the highest 
production ceiling is maintained. We believe that Kuwait and 
Saudi Arabia are using this method now. 
  [Kulayb] The West wants you to declare a clear position on 
the border issue with Kuwait. Why don't you recognize the 
borders and Kuwait's sovereignty over these borders? 
  [Salih] Actually, we are taken aback when this issue is 
submitted in this manner. Until 2 August 1990 Iraq had 
recognized Kuwait as a state and had treated its amir as a head 
of state. Kuwait's amir was even honored by the al-Rafidayn 
medal first class. But things changed when we entered Kuwait 
militarily. We believe that there are known factors behind 
this, because the plot was exposed and Kuwait's amir was the 
perpetrator of this plot against Iraq. Everything is now clear, 
since we implemented the Security Council resolutions. The 
issue of Kuwait is in the past, as stated by Deputy Prime 
Minister Tariq 'Aziz. 'Aziz even reiterated this stance in his 
message to the Security Council president, French Ambassador 
Jean-Bernard Merimee. 
  [Kulayb] What about your relations with Iran and Turkey? 
  [Salih] I prefer not to talk about this subject. We had 
excellent relations with Turkey. We still maintain some of 
these ties, but we hope that one day we will promote our 
bilateral relations. Iran's stance is variable, shifting 
between negative and positive aspects. We hope that Iran, as a 
Muslim neighbor country, will adopt the correct attitude toward 
Iraq. This is not difficult for Iran. This would benefit both 
countries. 
  [Kulayb] The Western countries continue their embargo on 
Iraq, and you continue to besiege the Kurds. Why did the 
relations deteriorate with the Kurds in the north and the 
Shiites in the south? 
  [Salih] I believe that those who are objective would find 
that all that is being said on these matters is untrue and 
inaccurate. As for the Shiites, they are leading Iraq side by 
side with t?eir Sunni brothers. Concerning the Kurdish problem, 
if the United States, Britain, and France withdrew their troops 
deployed in southern Turkey, the situation would return to its 
pre-1990 status. Iraq's Kurds enjoy full rights. They have 
their autonomous region and their language: the second official 
language in Iraq. They also have their local parliament and 
government. 
  [Kulayb] We asked you the question because Mas'ud Barzani 
has 
increased his attacks on Iraq, and also because the Kurds stress 
that Baghadad has imposed a new oil embargo on Kurdistan. 
  [Salih] The whole country is under siege. Therefore, the 
talk about the siege of Kurdistan is of no use. Barzani's 
attacks on Iraq are motivated by the United States. The game 
has been uncovered and it is disgraceful for an Iraqi to talk in 
this way. This is treason.

Islamic Resistance forces. They are the commander of the 51st 
Armored Division and Staff Colonel [name indistinct], commander 
of the 47th Brigade. 
  According to the sources, the division commander was killed 
in an attack launched by the Islamic Resistance last week 
against a military convoy in the area of al-Rumaylah, in 
al-Basrah governorate. The sources added that the men of the 
resistance inflicted heavy losses on the regime troops and 
forced them to retreat to their back positions. 
  Our sources in al-Basrah marshlands have said that tyrant 
Saddam's 47th Brigade has sustained heavy human and material 
losses due to the courage and steadfastness of the Islamic 
Resistance troops. The sources affirmed that dozens of bodies 
were scattered over the battlefield and that the body of the 
brigade commander was seen among those of a number of officers 
of different ranks. 
  Our sources in the southern marshlands report the continued 
massing of regime troops around the marshlands to prepare for 
new attacks against displaced civilians.

<F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by Barzan al-Tikriti: "What is </F>
Required From Iraqi Diplomacy Now and in the Future?"] 
  [Text] The Iran-Iraq war imposed a certain method of 
political action on the Foreign Ministry, represented by its 
focus on the United Nations while paying less attention to 
bilateral relations. Perhaps this was justified by certain 
circumstances and by bilateral relations that did not require 
constant contact in order to be developed. Moreover, the 
political situation in Iraq at that time allowed it to achieve 
successes at the UN because of the Iranian rejection of any 
peaceful settlement to the Iraqi-Iranian conflict. This is in 
addition to the fact that most other countries understood Iraq's 
stand, except for major and Western countries, which had selfish 
interests and sought to prolong the conflict on the ground, 
taking advantage of the United Nations as a political forum that 
provided them with an opportunity to avoid a peaceful solution. 
This is similar to the present situation, but with a different 
form and method aimed at keeping Iraq in its current situation 
for the longest time possible so that these countries can meet 
their agenda in the region. This was clear in their alternating 
support for Iraq and for Iran. 
  It is also obvious that the means available to Iraq at the 
time were no longer available after 2 August 1990 and the 
subsequent barbaric aggression against Iraq. On the contrary, 
the United Nations became a field for political confrontation 
against Iraq, through the use of all its institutions, as a main 
tool to break the will of and destroy Iraq. This restricted the 
role of Iraq in terms of influencing these institutions and the 
UN member states because of U.S., Western, and Zionist hegemony. 
This fact led to the conclusion that all of Iraq's efforts at 
the international organization's level would not achieve their 
objectives even though Iraq mobilized all legal, political, and 
factual arguments to support their case. 
  In light of this situation, I believe that Iraq should no 
longer deem it enough to work with the United Nations alone -- 
although this is something that has been imposed on Iraq and 
Iraq has been given no other choice. In order to support and 
render its work a success, Iraq should intensify its bilateral 
contacts, not only with UN member states, but also with all 
countries of influence within their particular geographical 
groups, based on a plan created by the Foreign Ministry. If 
this is achieved and we are able to realize tangible progress in 
those relations that were greatly harmed, then our stand in the 
United Nations will improve and our proposals and views will 
have an effect on friends and just nations. This is especially 
true if we take into consideration that the current 
international situation has changed and that there has been an 
emergence of many countries that could express their viewpoint 
in a manner different than that during the Kuwait crisis. 
  I note, regrettably, that we have ignored our continuing 
ties 
with our friends. Our moves were confined to certain periods of 
time, after which we forgot about such moves until major events 
on the level of our relation with the United Nations occurred. 
Even if we made a move toward one of these nations, such a move 
basically ended up in New York because we did not have many 
ambassadors in many important countries that could have 
influence on a case such as ours. 
  Based on my study of the developments in countries' stands 
toward us, I find it appropriate that the Foreign Ministry's 
action plan should cover many fronts: 
  Within the framework of inter-Arab relations, it is 
necessary 
to continue our contacts with the countries whose stands toward 
us continue to be relatively positive. 
  As for the Gulf countries, it has become clear to every 
observer that there has been a change in their stands toward 
Iraq. Some are even publicly announcing their stands and their 
sympathy with us without any fear from the media. These 
developments should be an incentive for us to intensify and 
broaden our contacts with these countries. 
  We also find that stands on the international level are 
tangibly improving. Even though it did not make a declared 
stand exactly as we wanted, Britain is no longer raising the 
banner against Iraq as it did before. Mr. Tariq 'Aziz's meeting 
with the British ambassador at the Security Council may not be 
considered a bad step. What applies to Britain also applies on 
other European countries, including France, Italy, Spain, and 
former socialist states, led by Russia. If we are able to reach 
out to these countries and talk to them in the language of 
interests that they understand, then I am confident that we can 
reach good results. 
  It is important not to restrict our moves toward certain 
countries. There are countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin 
America that have influence in the international arena and at 
the same time have economic interests and problems that Iraq can 
help solve.

  [Text] Baghdad, 28 Mar (INA)--AL-QADISIYAH has said Iraq is 
about to reenter the oil market. In an editorial today, the 
newspaper expresses confidence that Iraq, since it is a 
heavyweight, will be the decisive factor in the balance between 
supply and demand in the oil markets in a manner that preserves 
the rights of the exporting countries. 
  The paper focused on the contacts several oil companies and 
establishments are making with Iraq. It said the ghost of the 
resumption of Iraqi oil exports is haunting some agent OPEC 
member states which placed the wealth of their peoples at the 
service of the imperialist and Zionist circles to prevent the 
organization from reaching an agreement that secures the 
interests of its members. 
  It said the objective of the aggression against Iraq was 
clear from the beginning when the imperialist circles tried to 
control oil sources and tighten the siege on Iraq. It added 
that the aggression did not stop, but expanded to include all 
oil-exporting countries with the aim of preventing them from 
utilizing their resources in building their development 
capabilities and improving their economic and social conditions. 
  The newspaper emphasized that the only way to stop 
aggression 
against oil states is through fixing a production ceiling by 
which all OPEC member states abide in order to secure the rights 
of exporting nations and find the means that secure growth and 
prosperity for these nations. 
  The newspaper criticized the OPEC ministerial committee's 
decision to maintain the current output ceiling. It said this 
decision will seriously harm those who adopted it, and is viewed 
as serving the interests of imperialism, whose prosperity and 
might have been realized at the expense of the struggling and 
developing nations.

  [Text] Baghdad, 27 Mar (INA)--An Iraqi newspaper has stated 
that the case for perpetuating the unfair embargo clamped on 
Iraq has been immensely weakened, and that no one can any longer 
justify the perpetuation of this embargo. 
  In an article today, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH, which speaks 
for the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, adds that Iraq's 
international image is shining, and that its brightness will 
extinguish the light in the eyes of evildoers, defeatists, and 
dollar worshipers. 
  The paper goes on to say: The reason the embargo, along with 
Ekeus, have been pushed into a corner is manifested in the fact 
that Ekeus has continued to evade the issue of setting a date 
for the start of "long-term monitoring" per Resolution 715, 
although this monitoring actually started before the beginning 
of this year. 
  The paper says that for some time, there have been 
increasing 
Arab and international calls for lifting the unfair embargo 
clamped on Iraq. In this regard, the paper notes the statements 
made by former French Defense Minister Jean-Bernard Chevenement, 
who has described the anti-Iraq embargo as an objectionable 
scandal for humanity, adding that he is indignant over the 
suffering the embargo is causing to Iraqi children. 
  Commenting on those who have been blinded by malice, those 
who placed their destiny in the hands of Zionists and 
colonialists and spent the Arab nation's wealth buying 
consciences to ensure the perpetuation of the embargo against 
the Iraqi children, women, and elderly, the paper urges them to 
correct their positions and come to their senses.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk] </F>
  [Text] Since 6 March, the murderous Saddamite regime has 
been launching a barbaric and wide-scale military campaign 
against the marshes overlooking al-Nasiriyah, al-Basrah, and 
al-'Amarah cities, with a view to besieging and annihilating our 
people who live there. It is part of a premeditated criminal 
plan to stop the popular current, which is opposed to the 
regime's criminal practices against our struggling people. 
  According to the information we have received from our 
strugglers in the region, the authority's troops conducted a 
large offensive along several battlefronts, using tanks, 
artillery, and infantry troops from four divisions and backed up 
by regiments from the Republican Guards. They overran a large 
area of the marshes following concerted artillery bombardment 
using internationally banned napalm bombs, which caused huge 
fires in several villages in the region that left several 
villagers dead. 
  The following facts emerge from the recent treacherous 
Saddamite attack against our people in the south: 
  1. The isolated regime in Baghdad has launched the attack to 
liquidate the bastions of Iraqi jihad and popular resistance, 
which pose an increasing threat to the regime, have become 
rallying points for the people, and provide a ray of hope for 
salvation now that the international threats to bring down the 
regime have vanished. 
  2. Saddam and his gang continue to act with hatred toward 
the people and a desire to harm and muffle them, despite the 
catastrophes, perils, and calamities caused by this gang to the 
people; this increases day after day without any hope of change 
in the gang's bloody and inhuman practices. 
  3. The new world order, led by the United States and backed 
by its allies, does not care much about the constant deaths, 
general starvation, and utter misery in Iraq caused by Saddam's 
gang. They also do not care much about the violations of human 
rights in the south. Among the Security Council resolutions, 
they only care about the destruction of Iraq's strategic 
weapons. For this reason, they focus their entire attention on 
destroying these weapons, a goal that has turned into the 
standard criteria for judging the Iraqi regime's attitude and 
discipline. 
  4. The annihilation, destruction of the environment, and 
devastation of the populated areas in southern Iraqi are part of 
a comprehensive Zionist scheme, which closely resembles the 
campaigns of annihilation and demographic changes carried out by 
the Zionist entity in Palestine and is intended to be 
standardized throughout the Islamic countries. 
  5. The silence of world public opinion at what is happening 
in Iraq is part of a multifaceted collusion against the gigantic 
Islamic trend, which started during the blessed uprising of 1991. 
  Let us all announce a general mourning throughout the world 
over the March 1994 massacre, which is still in progress. Let 
us all participate in organizing permanent and vocal marches in 
front of the Saddamite regime's embassies throughout the world. 
Let us intensify our protests over the world's murderous 
silence on the annihilation of our people. Let us do everything 
we can to help save our people, who are dying inside Iraq, and 
not just sit with our arms folded and accept the work of destiny.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by Pe'erli </F>
Shahar in Peres' office; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Shahar] During the 
negotiations on the Palestinian issue, do you not sometimes 
think: What is there to discuss with them at such length? Often 
it seems that creativity and imagination are required to keep 
the process alive and kicking, and you never get tired, and 
always come up with new phrasings and terminology. 
  [Peres] Some say that the Oslo agreement is very difficult, 
but it is not the agreement that is difficult -- it is the 
situation. We have to deal with a difficult situation, not a 
difficult agreement. We must always keep our aim in mind, while 
remembering the support that we have. We have a Knesset 
majority of one, and that majority can be lost. Hence, we must 
work with our eyes on the goal and our ears attentive to the 
support. This is what makes the process so difficult. At the 
same time, the Palestinians have very high expectations and make 
very high demands. 
  [Shahar] What do you mean when you say that the Oslo 
agreement was difficult? Was it the fact that we talked to the 
PLO, the content, or the discussions? 
  [Peres] Sitting with the PLO was difficult too. The PLO 
used to be taboo for most Israelis. This was a major obstacle 
to overcome, for us and for people outside our camp. The second 
thing was the issue of Jerusalem. Had we not stumbled over the 
issue of Jerusalem today, we would have reached an agreement. 
The third matter were the settlements. There are 130,000 
settlers. It is nothing like the Sinai. Another issue was 
security. 
  [Shahar] Looking back, do you not believe that the decision 
to leave them intact was a mistake? 
  [Peres] No, because had we made the opposite decision, we 
would have antagonized and lost the support of all of those who 
support them. 
  [Shahar] Perhaps they should not have been mentioned at all 
in the negotiations? 
  [Peres] Not mentioned? The settlers would have asked: What 
about us? This way we tell them: You stay where you are. 
  [Shahar] Thus putting off the confrontation for how long? 
Two years? Five years? 
  [Peres] But this cannot be done. There are certain 
questions that need to be answered first regarding the police 
force that would operate there; their rights; their protection. 
What do you mean not mention them? Their status has to be 
determined. 
  [Shahar] But leaving them in their place creates a situation 
of constant friction? 
  [Peres] And if they are not mentioned, what then? Should 
they be removed or not? 
  [Shahar] A decision will have to be made. 
  [Peres] Such as? 
  [Shahar] I am not expressing opinions here. I am the 
reporter. While you attempt to solve the problem of two to five 
years of friction, there are Israelis and Palestinians who want 
to establish facts on the ground.... 
  [Peres] And what it the alternative? 
  [Shahar] Settle the matter now. State that you 
wholeheartedly believe they should be removed in order for the 
Palestinians to be able to maintain their autonomy, perhaps. 
  [Peres] This would have created an intolerable situation. 
Remember how hard it was to remove the settlers from the Sinai. 
  [Shahar] But you will reach this point in the negotiations 
on the permanent arrangement. 
  [Peres] Maybe yes, maybe no; we will see. 
  [Shahar] You typically think of long-term results. What do 
you believe will happen at the end of the interim period? 
  [Peres] I believe that if there is a change of attitude 
between us and the Palestinians, the settlers could stay. I see 
no reason why not. 
  [Shahar] Do you not see the Palestinians presenting an 
ultimatum for a state after the interim period? 
  [Peres] What do you mean ultimatum? Will they aim their 
artillery at us? I believe they will make demands and we will 
seek a compromise, a solution. 
  [Shahar] The problems on the Palestinian track are 
extremely difficult, and it appears that the Palestinians and 
the Syrians are holding up comprehensive peace in the Middle 
East. Last week it was announced that a Jordanian bank is 
opening a branch in the West Bank. Are we expecting economic 
relations with Jordan before we establish diplomatic relations? 
  [Peres] I doubt it. 
  [Shahar] Why? 
  [Peres] Jordan is hesitant at this time. Perhaps it 
believes that nothing will come out of the 'Arafat business. 
Perhaps it believes the same about al-Asad. It also could be 
that it wants to change the current pace. 
  [Shahar] Does the fact that negotiations with the 
Palestinians move slowly help our relations with al-Asad, who 
feared that we will reach an agreement with the Palestinians and 
leave Syria isolated? 
  [Peres] I am not certain. This speculation is hard to 
verify. 
  [Shahar] What is really happening with al-Asad? 
  [Peres] Al-Asad has made a strategic decision to opt for 
peace, but he has not yet answered four cardinal questions. The 
first regards the nature of the negotiations, which projects on 
the nature of peace. The negotiations cannot be held on a 
narrow and rigid basis. He must change that if he wants peace. 
Second, when he speaks of comprehensive peace, he remains vague. 
  [Shahar] Several senior Syrian figures appeared in 
international symposiums where they spoke of full peace for full 
withdrawal, explaining that full peace includes all of the.... 
  [Peres] I have not heard a Syrian official doing that. 
  [Shahar] What about the meeting between Clinton and al-Asad? 
  [Peres] We saw Clinton answering this question, not al-Asad. 
  [Shahar] But he said that al-Asad has reached a decision. 
  [Peres] We will see. The third is the issue of security 
arrangements. We are on the Golan for security reasons, and we 
must provide answers to the security problems that would be 
created in case of a withdrawal from there. 
  [Shahar] Do you not often say that peace is security? 
  [Peres] Yes, peace is definitely an element of security. I 
am not saying that it is the only one. The fourth thing is 
Lebanon, because both Syria and Lebanon have been hinting that 
it is not standing on its own feet. 
  [Shahar] What is the solution we seek with Lebanon? 
  [Peres] We believe it would be desirable for Lebanon to be 
independent, in control of its territory. Securing the north of 
Israel is our supreme interest. We have no business in running 
the Lebanese policies for them. We conduct an Israeli defense 
policy which has bearings on Lebanon. 
  [Shahar] Do you mean that if al-Asad guarantees appropriate 
security arrangements in Lebanon we would settle for that? 
  [Peres] Yes. 
  [Shahar] It has been often said that in 1994 matters will be 
determined. Do you really believe we will reach some 
comprehensive breakthrough this year? 
  [Peres] We will reach breakthrough; I do not know if it will 
be comprehensive. 
  [Shahar] Where will it take place, and where not? 
  [Peres] I see a good chance for implementing the agreement 
with the Palestinians. I also regard this a major psychological 
and political breakthrough. We may also start things with the 
Syrians, but this depends on the way Syria behaves. 
  [Shahar] Does Jordan depend on the Palestinians, Syria, or 
both? 
  [Peres] Jordan depends on whoever it believes it does. I 
believe it is independent. 
  [Shahar] Who does it believe it depends on? 
  [Peres] They apparently believe that Jordan cannot precede 
everyone with its treaty. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report on an "exclusive" interview with Deputy Foreign </F>
Minister Yosi Beilin by Qol Yisra'el correspondent Nawwaf 
al-Nabbari in Jerusalem on 28 March; from the "With the Midday 
Events" program -- report is interspersed with recorded portions 
of Beilin speaking in Hebrew] 
  [Text] Our first question to Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. 
Yosi Beilin was, naturally, about tomorrow's negotiations with 
the Palestinians in Cairo and whether some of the sticking 
points will obstruct or delay the negotiations. Dr. Beilin 
hoped these points would not delay or obstruct the negotiations 
and said substantive issues have been resolved. What remains, 
he said, are quantitative and numerical issues such as the size 
of the police force, including the Palestinian police force and 
international observers. He expressed his conviction that when 
the matter is related to quantitative and numerical issues, it 
will be easier to reach an agreement. He hoped that 
negotiations on the Gaza and Jericho agreement will also begin 
tomorrow and that this issue will be dealt with quickly. 
  Regarding the phased settlement in Gaza and Jericho, Dr. 
Beilin said the issue of the number of Palestinian police and 
that of coordination and understanding between them on the one 
hand, and the Israeli police and Army on the other, are still 
unresolved. This is one of the issues to be discussed in 
connection with the phased settlement just like the economic 
issues. As for security arrangements in Hebron, talk is 
revolving around small and limited numbers of Palestinian 
policemen, and this continues to be the main topic of 
disagreement. Naturally, the deputy foreign minister said, 
there are no difficult substantive issue in connection with the 
issue of Hebron or even the Gaza and Jericho agreement. 
  Asked whether the deployment of a Palestinian force is the 
necessary step now to maintain security in Hebron or if it is 
related to a step toward the Palestinian side aimed at 
supporting the position of the Palestinian leadership and 
consequently restoring the previous momentum of the 
negotiations, Dr. Beilin said: I think this step is symbolic. 
Moreover, I do not belittle such symbols. I do not think that 
those policemen are the perfect solution for the present 
security problem. I am aware of the problem between the 
settlers and Palestinians in the territories. But, it is 
important to demonstrate here that we are alert to what happened 
in the aftermath of the massacre in Hebron. We, too, do not 
overlook the dimensions of this action and we are ready to 
undertake an unusual action. Talk is about a Palestinian force 
in Hebron and an international presence. We have not planned 
for this happening before a comprehensive agreement is reached. 
  Replying to another question, Dr. Beilin did not want to 
discuss proposals about rounding up Jewish settlers in one or 
two locations in Hebron to prevent friction and maintain the 
security of both sides. He said the security authorities will 
find the right answer to these issues. 
  Asked about the way the decisionmakers in Jerusalem view the 
situation of the present Palestinian leadership as a leadership 
to which one can talk in the future when a final solution is 
reached, and the extent of the Palestinian leadership's ability 
to make crucial decisions under critical circumstances like the 
present ones, the deputy foreign minister said: I do not want 
to discuss details of the final solution or the nature of the 
political solution to the Palestine question although you know 
how firmly I support a solution based on a confederation between 
the Palestinians and Jordan. I am following what is taking 
place in the Palestinian camp and I must in this regard say that 
I was not taken by surprise. Everyone knew that at a decisive 
moment there would be a difficult confrontation within this 
camp. We have never thought that once a settlement is reached 
or a solution between us and the Palestinians gets closer, all 
the Palestinians will clap in support of the realistic current 
within the PLO. Undoubtedly, I am aware of the difficulties 
facing this current or trend in implementing its policy. But, I 
also believe that this current will emerge from this process 
stronger and firmer. When a change occurs on the ground and 
when the Palestinian police force is deployed in Gaza and 
Jericho, and in case autonomy is established--which will enjoy 
economic and practical ability and authority--this current or 
main party within the Palestinian camp will get stronger. 
  During his conversation with us, Dr. Beilin expressed 
concern over the phenomenon of extremism and the violation of 
law by certain factions living at the margin of the Israeli 
society. He said he never thought such a phenomena exist, 
particularly in this magnitude. He indicated that the decisions 
made by the government proved that the Israeli Government has 
realized the characteristics and dangers of the new situation 
after the Hebron massacre and acted accordingly. 
  In light of the good chances that economic talks between 
Israel and the Palestinians, which started in Paris on the 
Palestinian customs system, will resume in Cairo tomorrow, we 
asked Dr. Beilin about the economic future of Israel and the 
Palestinians and whether the two economies should be disengaged. 
He said: Had it been up to me and were it possible to start 
right from the beginning, I would have certainly been inclined 
to disengagement on the economic level between us and the 
territories. Today, we cannot seriously talk about this because 
the territories connection with Israel and vice versa is 
extremely big and because the Palestinians depend mainly on us. 
If we close the borders between the territories, or the 
autonomous areas and Israel, it would mean thousands of 
Palestinians would not be able to work in Israel and would face 
unemployment problems. This would undoubtedly be immediately 
reflected in the living standards in the autonomous Palestinian 
areas. Therefore, although I wish to see economic and political 
disengagement between the two sides, I know this is not 
realistic and we have to continue the present situation, but 
perhaps on a narrower scale. 
  Finally, we asked Dr. Beilin about talks with Syria and the 
U.S. role in healing the rift between the two sides, as well as 
bringing solutions closer to reality, he said: The Americans 
returned from Syria, encouraged by Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad's readiness to push forward the peace process. I also 
hope that negotiations with Syria will resume in the second half 
of April. I hope the Americans will intensify their efforts 
because I do not envisage any progress with Syria without 
intensive U.S. intervention. Moreover, the prospects of 
reaching an agreement with Syria in 1994 are still realistic and 
possible.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Knesset member 'Abd-al-Wahhab </F>
Darawshah, the head of the Arab Democratic Party, in "the 
occupied West Bank," by Fawzi al-Jundi, in Cairo on 29 March; 
from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Jundi] Let us begin this dialogue by 
referring to discussions inside Israel regarding dangers 
stemming from the presence of settlers in the occupied Arab 
territories. 
  [Darawshah] A heated debate is taking place on the Israeli 
political map and among the Arab community in Israel regarding 
the necessary arrangements to guarantee protection for the 
Palestinians and prevent the settlers' aggressive acts against 
the sons of our Palestinian people in the West Bank and the Gaza 
Strip. The reality is that although the Israeli Government has 
facilitated the entry of a Palestinian police force and 
international forces consisting of Norwegian police, these 
arrangements do not seem to be enough, because the population of 
Palestinians in the occupied areas exceeds 2 million, all of 
whom need protection. They need protection from the armed 
extremist settlers, who have been equipped with arms by the 
Israeli Government. They receive the full support of the 
Israeli Government. The Palestinian people in the occupied 
areas also need international protection from the Israeli Army 
and the other security organs, particularly the musta'ribin 
units [Israeli agents who disguise themselves as Arabs], who 
fool the Palestinians. 
  While we welcome the recent agreement, I am not confident 
that these arrangements will provide real protection for the 
Palestinians in the occupied territories. While there is 
settlement and occupation, the problem will remain. The fears 
of massacres similar to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in 
Hebron and other such acts will remain. The dangers of renewed 
daily aggression against the Palestinian people will remain. 
  [Al-Jundi] But how do you read Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq 
Rabin's recent statements that he is not ready to meet the 
Palestinian demand to evacuate the settlers from the Palestinian 
city of Hebron? 
  [Darawshah] This stance is not justified. Yitzhaq Rabin 
fears the Israeli right. He is afraid of the demonstrations the 
Israeli right might hold. The extremist and criminal settlers 
are at the head of the Israeli right. This is why he tries to 
appease them at the expense of the peace process, the 
Palestinian people, and the Arab nation. Proceeding from this 
perspective, we criticize Yitzhaq Rabin's stance and demand 
practical action to prove that he has honest intentions toward 
protecting the Palestinians and deterring the extremists, be 
they settlers or Israeli forces, to prevent them from taking 
action against the Palestinians and carrying out crimes of 
terrorism against them. This is why Yitzhaq Rabin has been 
talking a great deal about peace but he has implemented no real 
practical steps that deter the extremist settlers and secure 
protection for our defenseless Palestinian people in the 
occupied Arab territories. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Jundi] How will the Israeli people view the need to 
implement the Gaza-Jericho Agreement quickly as a means to cool 
down the heated struggle inside the occupied territories? 
  [Darawshah] There are two trends on the Israeli street. The 
Israeli right does not want to implement this agreement and is 
working to destroy it. It is also trying to prevent an Israeli 
withdrawal from even one inch of the occupied Arab territories. 
The left wants the agreement to be implemented immediately to 
allow the PLO led by Yasir 'Arafat to enter Gaza and Jericho 
first, implement the agreement, and prevent things from 
worsening. 
  There is interest among the forces advocating peace inside 
Israel in implementing this agreement. But the problem is that 
the Israeli Government swings between the right and the left. 
In particular, Yitzhaq Rabin swings back and forth, although he 
heads a leftist government. He has not had the courage to take 
practical steps to prove his credibility and readiness to 
implement the agreement on 13 April. This is why discussions 
concentrate on how to reach agreement on implementing the Oslo 
Agreement by 13 April. I doubt withdrawal will take place by 
the middle of next month. It could take much longer than that.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Text] "When the Gaza-Jericho negotiations are completed 
and an agreement with the PLO is signed we will move on to 
serious negotiations with Syria," a senior political source in 
Jerusalem told HA'ARETZ. He said "we are now preparing the 
ground for serious negotiations with Syria." According to the 
source "the price for peace with Syria is obvious, but there is 
no point in declaring it before negotiations start." 
  The source said he believes that Israel will reach a peace 
agreement with Syria this year. In Jerusalem's contacts with 
Washington, it was suggested that Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher come to the region prior to the completion of the 
talks with the Palestinians, participate in the signing ceremony 
of the Gaza-Jericho withdrawal agreement, and go on to Damascus. 
In this way, Christopher's trip would symbolize transferring 
the emphasis in the peace process from the Palestinian track to 
the Syrian one. 
  Israel expects at this stage additional public moves by 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad as an opening to negotiations and 
in order to help convince public opinion to support an agreement 
between the two sides. Al-Asad's agreement to renew the talks 
with Israel, even before the Palestinians announce the 
resumption of their talks, is seen in Jerusalem as a sign of the 
Syrian president's seriousness and as a proper response to Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's remarks on Syria during his recent 
visit to the United States. Rabin said that "the time has come 
for painful decisions over Syria. We will agree to do what is 
required of us if the Syrians do what is required of them." 
  Nevertheless, analysts recently reiterated the evaluation 
they passed on to the political echelon in Jerusalem that 
al-Asad will not advance significantly in the peace process with 
Israel before he is convinced that Israel intends to withdraw 
from the Golan Heights. 
  Israel hopes that speeding up the talks with the Syrians 
will 
also find expression in a change in the negotiating format and 
character. Israel called on Syria to replace Muwaffaq 
al-'Allaf, its representative to the negotiations, claiming that 
its delegate, Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, is a Rabin confidant 
while al-'Allaf does not have a similar status with al-Asad. 
Another Israeli request, raised by Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres during his recent visit to Washington, was that a peace 
settlement with Syria lead to peace arrangements with Jordan and 
Lebanon, and normalization of relations with the other Arab 
states, except for Libya and Iraq. Israel will not, however, 
present that as a condition to the Syrians so that the agreement 
with Damascus will "stand on its own two feet." Syrian Foreign 
Minister Faruq al-Shar' said recently in talks with western 
sources that Syria opposes a separate agreement with Israel, but 
will be able to make do with "progress" along the other tracks. 
Al-Shar' made it clear that Syria will oppose the lifting or 
easing of the Arab boycott on Israel at the present time. He 
explained that such an action depended on progress in the peace 
process and that the Arabs would not give up such an important 
card at this stage of the negotiations. Syria also ties its 
participation in the multilateral talks to progress in the 
bilateral negotiations with Israel.

  [Text] Six Palestinians were killed this evening in the 
Jabalyah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. Our correspondent 
Shlomi Eldar was told that the six were Fatah members who this 
afternoon attended a march in the al-Shaykh Radwan neighborhood 
of Gaza commemorating a Fatah Hawks fugitive who was killed last 
year. The six were apparently driving back from the march 
wearing uniforms. Army sources told our correspondent that the 
six were riding in two cars, and they appeared suspicious to the 
troops. 
  Our military correspondent Alon Ben-David reports that an 
IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] undercover unit ordered them to stop, 
and they refused. The soldiers opened fire, killed six, and 
wounded a passerby. Severe riots broke out in the Jabalyah 
refugee camp, and the IDF considered imposing a curfew there. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1700 GMT on 28 March 
reports: "Curfew was clamped on Nabulus this afternoon after 
two locals were injured by soldiers who fired at rioters. The 
IDF intend to lift the curfew later this evening. A driver of 
military truck was injured this afternoon by stones thrown at 
his car in Janin." 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1900 GMT on 28 March 
adds that in the clash in Jabalyah, "two locals were injured." 
The report goes on to say that "the restrictions imposed on 
Nabulus this evening have been lifted."]

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Fatah has declared a 24-hour 
strike in the Gaza Strip in the wake of yesterday's incident in 
Jabalyah, and threatens to organize three days of violent 
clashes with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. 
  Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation 
to 
the talks with the PLO, phoned his counterpart Nabil Sha'th 
yesterday to explain that the killing of the six Fatah members 
in Gaza had not been an operation initiated by the IDF. Shahaq 
said it had been an encounter with an armed gang, and emphasized 
that IDF soldiers can only shoot when confronted with armed 
masked men. 
  Our Army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe says that the 
purpose of the phone call was to explain the circumstances of 
the incident on the eve of the resumption of the talks in Cairo. 
It has been asserted more than once in the talks with the PLO 
to date that the IDF will take action against any armed man 
likely to endanger our troops. 
  Meanwhile, it has been learned that some 70 percent of the 
IDF installations in the Gaza Strip have been relocated to 
alternative sites within the boundaries of the Green Line and to 
Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip. The IDF estimates that 
from the moment the agreement with the PLO is signed it will 
need three to five weeks to complete the withdrawal from Gaza 
and Jericho. Our correspondent has learned that Israel does not 
object to having the first Palestinian policemen arrive in Gaza 
next week even if there is still no agreement with the PLO. 
However, the Palestinians make the arrival of the policemen 
contingent on the signing of an agreement concerning Hebron.

  [Text] There is a great deal of outrage in the territories 
over the killing of six Fatah activists in Gaza. Serious riots 
erupted in Nabulus this morning, and our correspondent Moti Amir 
reports that 15 locals were wounded and a soldier was lightly 
injured by a stone. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has clamped 
a curfew on the city, as well as on the adjacent refugee camps. 
  Brigadier General Doron Almog, commander of IDF troops in 
the 
Gaza Strip, has been trying to calm down the situation. He 
phoned several Fatah leaders in the area this morning to explain 
the circumstances of the shooting of six armed Fatah members who 
aimed their weapons at the soldiers. 
  The six victims were buried late last night in the Jabalyah 
refugee camp. This morning a curfew was clamped on the camp, as 
well as on Bayt Lahiyah and adjacent areas. A 24-hour general 
strike called by Fatah is being observed today in the Gaza Strip. 
  Several stonethrowing incidents occurred near the homes of 
the mourning families. Locals claim that soldiers tried to 
prevent them from putting up shacks to accommodate the mourners.

  [Text] One Arab was killed and another 45 were wounded 
this morning in riots in the territories in response to the 
killing of six Fatah members in the Jabalyah refugee camp last 
night. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that 17-year-old 
'Umar 'Awwad al-Qabbani was killed by soldiers' gunfire in the 
al-Burayj refugee camp. His body was snatched away and buried. 
Another 15 Arabs were wounded by soldiers' gunfire in Jabalyah, 
Bayt Hanun, and Gaza. 
  Riots erupted this morning in most cities and refugee camps 
in Judaea and Samaria. The security forces clamped a curfew on 
Nabulus and its environs after 30 locals were wounded by 
soldiers' gunfire. A curfew was also imposed on Tulkarm and its

  [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will prevent the 
march of the settlers in Hebron on Wednesday. In reaction to 
media reports, the IDF spokesman wants to make it clear that the 
IDF command in Judaea and Samaria has not approved the march, 
slated to be conducted under the slogan "All Israel Is Hebron," 
and that the IDF will not safeguard it. It was also decided to 
prevent entry into Hebron on the day of the march to anybody who 
is not a town resident. 
  The body of a person suspected of collaboration with Israel, 
Muhammad 'Ali Abu-'Ata, 28, a resident of the Rimal 
neighborhood, was found near a garbage dump in Gaza. Local 
residents told our correspondent Moti Amir that Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam members murdered him 
since he participated in several IDF actions against wanted 
Hamas people. According to them, more than six months ago Hamas 
members murdered Abu-'Ata's brother for similar reasons.

<F P=106> [Report by Roni Shaqed] </F>
  [Excerpt] Attorney General Mikha'el Ben-Ya'ir informed the 
attorney for the Hebron settlers that no evacuation of Tall 
al-Rumaythah would take place in the coming 10 days. 
  The attorney general also said that an evacuation would take 
place only after proper deliberations are held either in the 
cabinet or the Knesset and after the settlers are given 
sufficient time to appeal to the High Court of Justice. 
  Similar remarks were made yesterday by Major General Dani 
Yatom, commander of the Central Command, to settlement leaders 
in Hebron and Qiryat Arba'. Gen. Yatom said that if the 
settlers are uprooted from Hebron it will be done in an orderly 
and public way and not like "thieves in the night." 
  Our correspondent Mikhal Goldberg reports that before this 
promise was made, Uri Qarzan, a Tall al-Rumaythah resident, 
appealed to the High Court of Justice to order the defense 
minister and the Army to give 72-hours notice before evacuating 
Jewish settlers from Hebron. The court will deliberate on the 
appeal this week. 
  Likud Knesset Member Mikha'el Eytan yesterday called on the 
prime minister and justice minister to give a week's prior 
warning before carrying out any evacuation in the territories. 
  The Hebron march which was due to take place tomorrow will 
be 
replaced by a large gathering of settlers in Qiryat Arba' on 
Thursday, it was decided yesterday following a day of 
discussions between the settlers and Gen. Yatom and Gen. Sha'ul 
Mufaz, Army commander in Judaea and Samaria. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Our settlement affairs correspondent Gil Litman has 
learned that over the past several days, settlers from the 
'Etzyon Bloc and the Hebron Hills have been touring the Hebron 
region and marking dozens of alternative routes to the city 
should the government decide to evacuate Jews. Dov Weinstock, 
in charge of the 'Etzyon Bloc fields, has said that the settlers 
will set up some roads to handle vehicles so that reinforcements 
can arrive in Hebron and help prevent the evacuation.

<F P=106> [Report by Shlomo Dror] </F>
  [Text] Settlers from the Hebron area, soldiers in a 
reserve battalion, have written a letter to Yitzhaq Rabin, prime 
minister and defense minister, in which they declared that 
following the suspension of their battalion commander, Reserves 
Major Yisra'el Blumental, they consider themselves discharged 
from reserve duty. Soldiers serving with the battalion reported 
that they intended to refuse to do reserve duty and turn in 
their IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Reserve identity cards. 
  Blumental, a settler from Qiryat Arba', has been the 
commander of a regional defense battalion in Hebron for several 
years. Major General Dani Yatom, the commander of the Central 
Command, suspended him after he described Dr. Barukh Goldstein 
as "a soldier fallen in battle" in a television interview. 
  News of the suspension was revealed two days ago, during 
Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq's testimony before the state 
commission of inquiry on the Hebron massacre. Professor Menahem 
Ya'ari, a member of the commission, told Baraq that the murderer 
served in a reserve unit in Qiryat Arba'. During the massacre, 
Ya'ari noted, he used a weapon which was issued to him by that 
unit. The commander of that same unit publicy described the 
massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs as a "battle." Ya'ari 
asked how it could happen that such a man had been in charge of 
issuing a weapon to someone who subsequently carried out such a 
terrible deed. 
  Baraq declared that to the best of his knowledge, the man 
had 
been relieved of his post. "At any rate, this man cannot be 
permitted to command IDF soldiers, not even reserve troops, 
especially not in an area like Qiryat Arba', the chief of staff 
said. 
  In reaction to this, Nahum Hoss, one of the soldiers in the 
battalion and an aide to Rabbi Levinger, said: "This is a 
political ouster. They are bringing politics into the Army. 
Blumental should be judged according to his professional 
ability as an officer and not according to some statement, 
which, in my opinion, was taken out of context. As far as I am 
concerned, Blumental is an excellent officer who I would follow 
to any battle. If he is not reinstated as commander of our 
battalion neither myself nor any of my comrades have anything to 
look for in an army that serves the government rather than the 
people." 
  An injunction issued after the Hebron massacre bars Hoss 
from 
carrying weapons. The police have so far not been able to hand 
him the injunction. Yesterday, Hoss asserted that he would not 
turn in his weapon. "I must continue defending the lives of my 
family and myself. I think the Army is mistaken if it thinks 
that it is serving the country by ignoring our request and doing 
without our battalion's reserve duty. Many people will follow 
in our footsteps," he said. 
  An officer in the battalion, who refused to reveal his name, 
said: "What would have happened if the Army had ousted an 
officer who was a member of Peace Now? Did the Army get rid of 
officers with left-wing views after Mordekhay Vanunu or Udi Adiv 
[who spied for Syria in the late 1960's]? Yatom should remember 
that the IDF is the peoples' army and not the army of Meretz. 
  The officer added that attempts were being made to convince 
the southern Hebron hills regional defense battalion to join 
their struggle. 
  An IDF spokesman said that Maj. Gen. Yatom had indeed 
decided 
to suspend Blumental pending an investigation into the matter. 
Blumental will be summoned for a hearing by Colonel Me'ir 
Kalifi, the commander of the Hebron Brigade and Major General 
Sha'ul Mufaz, the commander of IDF forces in the West Bank. 
They will then decide which steps to take against him.

  [Text] At least eight reserve soldiers who refused to 
serve in the territories over the past month were stationed for 
military service inside the Green Line. Our legal correspondent 
Shlomo Arad reports that one of them, Yo'el Shem-Tov, was tried 
and sentenced to 14 days in military prison after refusing to 
serve in Hebron. His commanders, however, waived the sentence 
and stationed him at a post which does not conflict with his 
conscience. 
  A spokesman for the Yesh Gvul [there is a limit] Movement 
said, however, that another reservist, Peter Weiner from Tel 
Aviv, was arrested last night at his home in Tel Aviv after he 
refused to report for duty with his unit which serves in the 
territories.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Text] Saudi Arabia is deliberately keeping oil prices low 
in order to undermine Iran's economy and regime, senior analysts 
told the political echelon in Jerusalem. The main aim of the 
Saudi oil policy, according to this evaluation, is to prevent 
Iran from becoming stronger, which the Saudis fear and are 
prepared to suffer economically as long as the harm they cause 
Iran is even greater. 
  The political echelon was informed that raising the price of 
oil by several dollars would significantly improve Iran's 
economy, which has a very heavy foreign debt of $30 billion, of 
which $8 billion are short-term debts. 
  Political sources in Jerusalem recently expressed concern 
about an agreement by Germany, Japan, and Switzerland to 
reschedule Iran's debts and to offer it new lines of credit. 
Iran is also negotiating a similar agreement with France. In 
the view of the analysts, Iran might use the money to purchase 
dual purpose technology which would permit it to advance its 
plans to develop nuclear weapons. 
  The analysts said that the scope of trade between the United 
States and Iran casts a shadow on the U.S. commitment to isolate 
Tehran. Iran's trade with the United States is smaller than 
with the Europeans and the Japanese. It was over $600 million 
last year, and in 1992 reached some $730 million, which was made 
up almost entirely of U.S. industrial equipment to Tehran. 
Iranian exports to the United States were very small, only some 
$20 million. 
  Israel warned the West about Iran's aspiration to obtain 
nuclear arms and its actions to encourage Islamic fundamentalism 
in the Arab states. Israel's policy was however not to present 
itself as an enemy of Iran, but to round up international 
support for a policy of curtailing Iran's rearmament and 
subversive tactics, and to support a U.S. policy of "dual 
containment" against Iran and its rival Iraq. 
  The evaluation recently presented to the political echelon 
in 
Jerusalem states that U.S. "dual containment" is no longer a 
single policy against Tehran and Baghdad. An analysis of a 
paper published by National Security Adviser Tony Lake in 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS shows that Washington's policy toward Iraq calls 
for the overthrow of President Saddam Husayn's regime. Its 
policy toward Iran is different. The United States is not 
trying to overthrow the Islamic regime in Iran and wants to 
influence Tehran to change its behavior and start a dialogue 
with Washington. It has, however, reservations about the 
policies of European states and Japan, which are seen as 
attempts to advance their business interests with Tehran. The 
Americans think that improving Iran's economic situation will 
decrease the regime's extremism. The analysis presented to the 
political echelon said that Israel early on expected "dual 
containment" to be expressed in an effort to isolate Iran 
politically and economically, as the United States had done with 
the USSR. 
  Elements in the U.S. intelligence community recently 
dismissed the Israeli evaluation of Iran's subversive activities 
in the Arab world. In their view, Iran is trying to keep up its 
revolutionary image and present itself as having influence in 
the Middle East way beyond what it really has, and that there is 
no real Iranian threat to undermine the existing regimes in the 
Arab states. 
  The U.S. sources believe that the fundamentalist movements 
in 
Egypt enjoy some aid from Iran, but do not want to be Tehran's 
satellites since they regard themselves as popular Egyptian 
organizations. Tehran is simultaneously maintaining ties with 
Husni Mubarak's government. In the U.S. view, Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] in the territories also does not want to 
operate as an Iranian satellite.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz returned from Cairo 
this afternoon after taking part in the 101st session of the 
Arab League Ministerial Council. At the airport, Minister 
Buwayz made a statement in which he said: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] You returned 
from Cairo today, after taking part in the 101st session of the 
Arab League Council. How do you assess the work of that 
session, particularly in relation to Lebanon? 
  [Buwayz] This conference was certainly held amid critical 
regional conditions. It involved sensitive topics, which we 
noted before leaving Beirut, primarily lifting the boycott and 
amending the League Charter. The most important thing during 
that session was the postponement of these sensitive issues, 
because we feel that conditions are not favorable for a change. 
The causes that led to and justified them at a certain stage 
still exist. 
  I believe that this session was very wise in overcoming some 
challenges and certain differences in views. Hence, it studied 
the agenda in depth and postponed discussion of a number of 
points that the League thought it was premature to review. 
  [Correspondent] You certainly carried the problem of the 
south with you to that conference. How was Arab solidarity 
regarding the ongoing Israeli aggression against the south? 
  [Buwayz] I believe that Arab solidarity concerning the issue 
of the south, Palestine, and all other Arab issues under 
consideration is very serious. It is not the idea of solidarity 
that counts; it is how we apply this solidarity that counts. I 
can say that the Arab League's work mechanism had earlier been 
submitted for discussion. I hope Arab accord will be further 
enhanced to help the League express this solidarity and unity. 
  [Correspondent] You held a number of meetings on the 
sidelines of the conference. Can you give us an idea about 
their outcome? 
  [Buwayz] Just like any other conference, this meeting gave 
the opportunity to hold side meetings. I held a number of 
intensive meetings with Arab foreign ministers, including Their 
Excellencies 'Amr Musa, Faruq al-Shar', the Qatari foreign 
minister, and others. I also held several meetings with the Arab 
League secretary general. 
  [Correspondent] Will the secretary general pay a visit to 
Lebanon soon? 
  [Buwayz] I believe that his excellency the Arab League 
secretary general will visit Lebanon in mid April to open the 
Arab League's legal center, which has selected Lebanon as a 
base. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Randah Taqiyy-al-Din: "Al-Hariri: State Not </F>
Applying Double Standards"] 
  [Excerpts] Paris -- [Lebanese] Prime Minister Rafiq 
al-Hariri has reiterated his accusation of Israeli involvement 
in inciting elements from the Lebanese Forces to blow up the 
Sayyidat al-Najah Church. However, he said that the Forces 
cannot be accused as a party until the outcome of the 
investigations is known. The disbandment of the Forces party 
was the result of an "administrative-political decision." He 
stressed that the authorities are not applying double standards 
when dealing with the parties and that the Lebanese resistance 
is to continue. 
  Al-Hariri was speaking to a number of Lebanese journalists 
in 
Paris following his meeting with French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe. [passage omitted] 
  Al-Hariri said that "all the measures we are taking are 
aimed 
at strengthening the situation. Lebanon is targeted. It is no 
secret.... Lebanon represents a challenge to Israel after peace 
[is achieved], because the stage ahead will witness an economic 
challenge." 
  Asked about the Lebanese Forces' responsibility for the 
church blast, he said: "We are not accusing the Forces, but, 
rather, elements [from them]. As for the party's disbandment, 
it was the result of an administrative-political decision based 
on a number of pieces of information available to the judiciary 
and security services. The issue was raised with the Council of 
Ministers and a decision was taken." [passage omitted] 
  Asked whether the decision to disband the Forces is a 
prelude 
to hitting Hizballah, he said: "Until an agreement is reached 
with Israel on its withdrawal from Lebanon, the resistance issue 
remains a red line which cannot be touched. We, the country, 
and the government have paid heavy prices for the sake of 
safeguarding the Lebanese' right to resist, and we will not stop 
it. This is settled. As for actions outside the resistance, 
they are unacceptable and will not be overlooked. Their 
perpetrators will be judged like anyone else. The resistance is 
limited to a certain area. Any actions outside this area will 
certainly not be overlooked." 
  Asked about Christians' fears that the resistance might 
contribute to reinforcing sectarian sentiments, he said: "If 
Samir Ja'ja' comes and decides to resist Israel and the state 
treats him differently from Hizballah, then the talk (about 
fears) is true." He pointed out that he has not made any 
contacts with Ja'ja' since the Lebanese Forces' arrest and the 
party's disbandment. [passage omitted]

  [Text] People's Assembly Speaker 'Abd-al-Qadir Qaddurah 
today received a Pakistani parliamentary delegation, led by 
Maulana Fazlur Rahman, chairman of the Pakistani National 
Assembly Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs. The meeting was 
attended by Shakir Is'ayyid, head of the Arab and Foreign 
Affairs Committee of the Syrian People's Assembly; Hasan Sibahi, 
member of the Syrian People's Assembly; and the Pakistani 
ambassador in Damascus. 
  The discussions dealt with parliamentary relations, 
cooperation and coordination, exchanges of parliamentary 
delegations, and means to reinforce parliamentary ties to serve

please his new comrades.

  [Text] Tehran, March 28, IRNA -- Iran's Foreign Ministry on 
Monday confirmed that Armenian troops deployed in Karabakh 
region had shot down an Iranian plane, killing all 32 passengers 
and crew members aboard. 
  "This bitter incident is a clear proof of the tense 
situation 
in Karabakh which endangers the lives of innocent people and 
those of foreign nationals," the Foreign Ministry said in its 
statement. 
  The Iranian aircraft, a C-130 Hercules, was flying from 
Moscow to Tehran with families of Iranian diplomats in Russia on 
board on March 17, when it exploded in mid air over Karabakh 
after being hit by a missile fired by Armenian troops based in 
the region, shortly after the plane had contacted Yerevan 
control tower at 19:10 GMT. 
  "The Islamic Republic of Iran reserves the right to take 
legal action... and receive compensations for the victims of 
the crash, and calls on the Armenian Government to identify and 
punish those guilty of downing the aircraft," the Foreign 
Ministry statement said. 
  It expressed regret that tension in Karabakh not only has 
caused heavy casualties and losses but has also endangered 
flight security in the region. 
  Those trying to fan the flame of war and heighten tension in 
the region should bear the consequences of such painful 
incidents, it warned. 
  The Foreign Ministry statement was based on a report filed 
by 
a team of Iranian experts dispatched to the site of crash to 
probe the incident.

  [Text] The Islamic Republic of Iran's Foreign Ministry has 
said that, according to the report prepared by the fact-finding 
team, the reason why our country's C-130 aircraft crashed in the 
Karabakh region was the forced alteration of its flight path, 
the lack of air traffic assistance and guidance from the 
region's control towers, and the impact of a missile fired by 
the Armenian forces stationed in the Karabakh region. 
  The Foreign Ministry, while reserving the right for the 
Islamic Republic of Iran to pursue the downing of the aircraft 
through legal and judicial means and to seek compensation for 
the victims, has called on the Armenian Government to identify 
and punish the perpetrators of this painful incident.

  [Text] Tehran, March 28, IRNA -- Foreign Minister 'Ali 
Akbar Velayati is to leave here today for Conakry on a 
six-nation tour of Africa which will take him to Guinea, Burkina 
Faso, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Kenya, and Namibia. 
  Political observers deem the visits as "very important" and 
in line with bilateral interests for further strengthening of 
political, economic and cultural ties as well as regional and 
international cooperation. 
  In the pre-revolution era, Africa was ignored by the shah's 
regime which had ties with only certain African countries such 
as the racist South African regime. However, the following the 
triumph of the Islamic revolution in 1079, Iran severed its 
relations with the racist South African regime upon the orders 
of the father of the Islamic revolution the late Imam Khomeini, 
and expanded its ties with sub-Saharan African countries. 
  Islamic Republic of Iran now has established ties with 20 
African countries at the ambassadorial level and "very sincere" 
relations with many others, but is yet to develop healthy 
economic ties with them. 
  The six African countries which Velayati is to visit are 
rich 
in gold, diamonds, silver, bauxite, zinc, iron, copper, tin and 
cobalt as well as in such agricultural products as coffee, 
cocoa, tea, rice, cotton, sugar cane and pineapple. 
  Iran can have favourable cooperation with the said countries 
and can invest in their mineral and agricultural sectors in 
favour of common interests. 
  However, Iran has no direct aerial and marine transportation 
links with the said countries to promote economic cooperation. 
  Contrary to Iran, the European Community, U.S., Japan and 
even the Zionist regime have embarked on economic investments in 
sub-Saharan Africa unilaterally to plunder the rich natural 
resources of the deprived continent.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Oil Minister Gholam Reza </F>
Aqazadeh-Kho'i by an unidentified correspondent; place and date 
not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. Aqazadeh, considering the 
decision by OPEC to maintain its production ceiling, please give 
us your assessment of this decision. Why was this decision 
made? What effects will it have on the oil market? 
  [Aqazadeh] Fortunately, this year the Majles and the 
government had predicted from the start that the current 
situation would continue. Therefore, in the government's 
proposal, a considerable reduction of income from oil had been 
predicted, and the Majles reduced the government's proposal. 
The figure this year is less than the figure for last year. 
Hence, the concerns that the government and Majles had in mind 
the situation of the market.... [pauses] They made the required 
decisions regarding this situation. 
  Of course, on the other hand, with the commissioning of 
certain major projects in the country, the demand for currency 
has been reduced. For example, our own ministry -- which was a 
major consumer -- our demand for currency has fallen 
considerably compared to previous years. 
  We hope that the changes in the oil market will not affect 
our macroeconomics [eqtesad-e kalan] too much. What has upset 
us, however, is that oil is being sold at an unrealistic price. 
This, on the whole, is not to the benefit of oil producers. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Engineer, considering the OPEC decision 
and your remarks, the price of oil will probably either remain 
the same or go down. What is your prediction for the second 
quarter of the year about the price of oil, taking into account 
that summer is approaching and there will less domestic demand? 
  [Aqazadeh] Yes. Let me say that when we faced the 
non-reduction in production in OPEC, a number of ministers 
proposed that the same production ceiling should be kept for the 
third and fourth quarter of the Christian year. Our decision is 
for nine months [sentence as heard]. This decision was made 
because our current difficulty is the second quarter. In the 
third and fourth quarters, demand will go up automatically, and 
the production ceiling can be in balance with the demand of that 
time.

  [Text] Economics Division. New guidelines on the procedures 
for transferring the shares of government corporations and 
companies, setting their prices, and selling them for 
installment payments were approved by the Economic Council. 
  RESALAT's economics correspondent reports that yesterday 
afternoon Mas'ud Rowghani-Zanjani, vice president of the 
republic and chief of the Plan and Budget Organization, gave a 
press conference in which he discussed the new guidelines on the 
procedures for transferring the shares of transferable 
corporations and companies belonging to the government and 
government organizations and companies, and for setting their 
prices and selling them for installment payments. 
  He discussed Article 4 of the measure enacted by the Council 
of Ministers concerning the transfer of the shares of government 
companies, whose priority has been given to the stock market. He 
said: According to this article, other methods may also be used 
for the transfer of the shares. 
  The vice president of the republic said: In the last four 
years basic and important steps have been taken with regard to 
the transfer of the shares of government companies, but we have 
not yet reached the desired point. Various steps must be taken 
concerning the stock market to increase its efficiency. 
  Rowghani-Zanjani emphasized the need to expedite the process 
of privatization. He said: In this area the government has 
required the Ministry of Economic and Financial Affairs to 
prepare guidelines for the transfer of shares outside the stock 
market. 
  RESALAT's economics correspondent reports that the measure 
enacted by the Economic Council concerning the transfer of 
shares, setting their prices, and the procedure for selling them 
for installment payments, which will go into effect on 1 
Farvardin next year [21 March 1994], reads as follows: 
  The base price of profitable producing companies (with the 
exception of agricultural and industrial and service companies 
and companies that have shown losses in the three years prior to 
transfer) is determined by dividing the net pretax profit by the 
rate of capital return, taking into account the factors 
affecting the company's adjusted profits, as well as the effects 
of the secondary factors that adjust the base price of the 
company's shares. 
  It is necessary to note that the rate of capital return is 
equal to the effective rate of profits on long-term capital 
five-year bank deposits (15 percent) in addition to 5 percent. 
  Likewise, the finished cost of development projects and the 
cost for the completion of semicomplete or operable projects 
that went into operation less than a year ago will be 
recalculated, adjusted by the foreign exchange cost at the 
current price of foreign exchange and also adjusted by the rial 
costs using the wholesale price indicator announced by the 
Central Bank or an expert, and after confirmation by the 
company's general assembly, the difference obtained in the 
recalculation will be added to the base price of the shares. 
  The transferring organization is required, prior to 
transferring the shares, to repay the debts having to do with 
the funds collected from the Treasury for development projects, 
or it must reach an agreement with the treasury on the procedure 
for that repayment. 
  Likewise, in cases designated by the official in charge of 
the organization making the transfer, to facilitate the transfer 
of the shares where a cash transfer is not convenient, the 
transfer may be done via installment payments. 
  It is necessary to note that installment sales are possible 
only when the buyer or buyers are seeking to buy all the 
transferring organization's shares at one time. 
  Installment sales for general purchase applicants, other 
than 
the workers and managers of each company, will be conducted as 
follows: 
  If 30 percent of the price of the transaction is paid in 
cash, the balance will be paid in installments over a three-year 
period. If 40 percent of the price of the transaction is paid in 
cash, the balance will be paid in installments over a three and 
one-half years. Likewise, if 50 percent of the price of the 
transaction is paid in cash, the balance will be paid in 
installments over a four-year period. 
  Likewise, to create means for the transfer of the shares of 
government companies to the managers and employees of these 
units, this measure says: If the employees and managers of the 
company wish to purchase the shares and if they are on an equal 
footing with other buyers, may pay 20 percent of the price of 
the transaction in cash and pay the balance in installments over 
a four-year period. 
  In the case of an installment sale, the price of the 
transaction consists of the cash price of the sale of the shares 
in addition to the banking system's profit on an installment 
sale in the industrial sector. 
  The guidelines on the procedure for the transfer of the 
shares of government organizations and companies state: 
  The base price for the sale of the shares must be confirmed 
by the minister in charge of the organization transferring the 
shares, and then it must be printed in an advertisement. 
  The advertisement of the transfer of the shares must be 
published in at least two high-circulation domestic newspapers. 
In addition to that, if necessary, as determined by the 
transferring organization, the announcement will also be made by 
the Voice and Vision organization or other information delivery 
methods. 
  The transferring organizations are also required to make the 
appropriate arrangements for the transfer of the shares. 
  The decision on whether to transfer the shares by auction, 
negotiations or sale on the stock market will be made by the 
minister in charge of the transferring organization. Of course, 
with regard to companies that have been accepted on the stock 
market, priority in the transfer of the shares will be given to 
the stock market. 
  These guidelines emphasize the publication of information 
concerning the shares sold on the stock market, via negotiations 
or through competitive bidding, so that at the time of the 
transfer information must be given by the transferring 
organization to those wishing to buy shares, such as the name 
and subject of the company's activities, the number of 
transferable shares and their percentage of the company's total 
shares, an announcement of the status of the remainder of the 
company's shares including the percentage of shares owned by 
other shareholders, specification of the place to obtain forms 
and related information, an announcement of the date the shares 
will be offered in the stock-market hall, the base price, the 
method of selling the shares in small lots or all at one time, 
any other kind of information or conditions the transferring 
organization deems it necessary for buyers to know, and an 
announcement of readiness for visits to the factory by 
applicants wishing to visit. 
  Based on this report, at the end of this press conference 
the 
chief of the Plan and Budget Organization excused himself from 
answering questions. To the question from RESALAT's 
correspondent concerning the sharp rise in the price of foreign 
exchange, he replied: I do not give interviews.

He said: Recently the market demand for foreign exchange by 
certain groups has increased dramatically, and this has caused 
an increase in its rate. 
  Dr. 'Adeli said the main groups are importers and merchants. 
He said: This group has put pressure on the foreign exchange 
market, and as a result of this demand, the corresponding rate 
of foreign currencies has increased. 
  He said: Factories and industrial units, which are mostly 
government-owned, have brought heavy demand to the foreign 
exchange market, and this has caused an increase in its rate, 
and this increase has also been accelerated by brokers and 
speculators. 
  Dr. 'Adeli said: Another factor, which has been very 
effective in the value of foreign exchange, is increases in the 
prices of products from some government factories, where this 
group mainly uses the bank's floating foreign exchange rate of 
1,750 rials [R]. 
  In explaining this matter, he said: These factories have 
raised the prices of their goods so much that importers of goods 
are using dollars that cost more than R2,000. 
  He noted that another factor in the increase in the foreign 
exchange rate is psychological, which must not be overlooked. He 
said: The method of reporting on changes in the foreign exchange 
rate by some publications is such that not only does it not 
serve to calm the economic atmosphere, it severely heats up the 
rumor market. 
  He added: At this time Iran's enemies, by decreasing the 
price of oil, are trying to stop Iran's growing economy. Thus 
the nation's various economic agents must join hands and prevent 
damage by the enemy. 
  Dr. 'Adeli said: To prevent plots like this, the various 
sectors must not increase demand on the foreign exchange market 
and cause the rate to rise. 
  He emphasized: All agents must work together to protect and 
stabilize the nation's money. One cannot expect to guide all the 
agents in the commercial, guild and financial sectors in the 
proper direction through Central Bank sales of foreign exchange. 
  Dr. 'Adeli said: Various studies have been done following 
the 
recent changes on the foreign exchange market. After views were 
exchanged on the Economic Council and in the Council of 
Ministers, the proposals studied were considered in the 
Paragraph 3 Committee. To bring about the necessary cuts in this 
year's foreign exchange costs, in view of the reduced pressure 
from the nation's foreign exchange commitments as the result of 
the current financial negotiations with our trading partners, 
and also in view of the reduced foreign exchange expenditures 
for next year as the result of investments and the 
self-sufficiency achieved in some economic sectors, the 
Paragraph 3, Note 29 Committee presented the following decisions 
to the president of the republic aimed at reducing the existing 
demand for foreign exchange on the free market and on the 
foreign exchange market and to answer that demand through the 
banking system: 
  1. The foreign exchange required to register the orders 
remaining in the Central Bank will be allocated in the form of 
drafts by the Central Bank, and the necessary steps will be 
taken concerning this amount by the end of the current year. 
  2. The Central Bank will allocate the foreign exchange 
required to register priority orders that are now in the banks, 
and will pay it in the form of drafts by the end of the current 
year. 
  3.- As of the beginning of the year 1373 [21 March 1994] the 
Central Bank will take steps to meet the demand for foreign 
exchange to register all orders that have been made through 
ordinary procedures such as the opening of credit documents by 
the commercial banks. 
  In view of the measures that have been taken, these kinds of 
credit documents will be paid when they are due. Thus all those 
seeking to import raw materials and parts will be able to get 
the foreign exchange they need at the bank's floating rate by 
opening credit documents payable on sight or payable at maturity 
at one of the commercial banks, after registering their orders 
at the Ministry of Commerce. 
  4. In view of the fact that the import of any kind of 
merchandise can be done only by registering the order at the 
Ministry of Commerce and through the lawful executive officer, 
the relevant organizations are therefore required to intensify 
the campaign against smugglers and to deal with violators. 
  5. When necessary, the Central Bank will intervene in the 
foreign exchange market in the manner required. 
  6. Increases in the prices of the products from government 
factories and companies and factories and companies affiliated 
with the government without the approval of the Economic Council 
has been prohibited. The Ministry of Commerce and the Consumer 
and Producer Protection Organization are required to take the 
steps necessary to set prices, in accordance with regulations. 
At the same time, government organizations and companies and 
organizations and companies affiliated with the government are 
not authorized under any circumstances to procure the foreign 
exchange they need on the free market. They are required to 
procure the foreign exchange they need exclusively through the 
lawful executive officer. 
  Dr. 'Adeli then advised the owners of industry, producers, 
and importers not to rush to buy the raw materials for the 
products they produce and not to obtain the goods they need on 
the free market, but rather to do their work at the proper time, 
calmly and gradually through normal bank procedures and using 
the banking system. 
  He said: The Central Bank's studies show that the market 
foreign exchange rate is not justifiable, and the Central Bank 
has decided not to increase the floating foreign exchange rate. 
It believes that with the cooperation with the other agents 
previously named, this rate can even be decreased. 
  Dr. 'Adeli said: Next year credit accounts will be opened in 
the normal way, and those registering orders should not rush to 
obtain their goods. 
  Decisions have also been made in the area of import 
procedures using the foreign exchange from exports, to be 
announced later by the Ministry of Commerce. 
  Dr. 'Adeli was then asked for his opinion about a rumor on 
the foreign exchange market that the government is increasing 
the foreign exchange rate to make up its budget deficit. He 
answered: This rumor is completely unfounded, because the 
government has no need to make up its budget deficit in this way. 
  He explained: Rial credits have been allocated to the same 
extent that we have revenues, and the Plan and Budget 
Organization has exercised great economy in its rial 
expenditures. Revenues are therefore entirely in line with 
expenditures, and for some costs 70 percent has been trimmed 
from the amount expected. 
  A second point is that this year foreign exchange costs have 
been sharply cut, so that the eight-month statistics for the 
nation's imports show savings of 35 to 40 percent on foreign 
exchange costs and reductions in the nation's imports, which is 
a striking figure. 
  Dr. 'Adeli said: The government and the bank favor a lower 
foreign exchange rate. If the bank decides to intervene in the 
market sometimes, this intervention will be to control prices. 
  Dr. 'Adeli was asked about the effects of the recent drop in 
the price of oil on recent events. He said: Decreased oil 
revenues affect the amount of foreign exchange the government 
sells, but several other things have also happened, which 
compensate for this drop in price to a great extent. 
  These events include the fact that in the year 1372 [21 
March 
1993-20 March 1994] heavy cuts were made in foreign exchange 
expenditures, and this was accomplished by controlling imports 
of certain goods, controls on imports and increased tariffs. 
  He said: The result of these steps was a reduction in the 
amount of goods imported into the country compared to the 
previous year. At the same time the nation's foreign exchange 
needs were reduced by self-sufficiency and investments in some 
sectors. 
  Dr. 'Adeli was asked about the effect of currency in 
circulation on the demand for foreign exchange. He said: 
Currency in circulation and its growth is an important factor in 
the excessive demand for foreign exchange. The people know that 
in the first half of the current year [21 March-23 September 
1993] the Central Bank made striking efforts to control currency 
in circulation. 
  In this regard 'Adeli asked the government factories and 
companies to manage their finances efficiently in order to 
minimize their need for currency in circulation, and to refrain 
from buying foreign exchange on the free market. 
  In conclusion he said: To control the foreign exchange rate, 
cooperation is necessary from all those involved.

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The 
first goal of the Majles in cutting expenses is to reform the 
government's administrative and financial structure. 
  The above was announced yesterday in an interview with 
RESALAT'S parliamentary correspondent by Engineer Hashem 
Rahbari, deputy from Tehran and member of the Majles Plan and 
Budget Commission. 
  He said: The Plan and Budget Commission believes that the 
administrative organizations can be managed in a more limited 
form than the present one and that this amount of cost is not 
needed for the nation's administrative organizations. If the 
price of foreign exchange is going to rise on the one hand and 
on the other hand the organizations are going to expand, no kind 
of structural reform will take place. 
  Continuing, he added: To cut unnecessary government 
expenses, 
the Majles has made a policy that strict economy will be 
observed in the purchase of buildings, land, automobiles, and in 
changing decorations and carpets, and this is the will of the 
Majles. On the one hand, in view of outstanding foreign 
commitments, to establish a positive direction, 50 percent of 
the cuts made in the government's proposed budget, in the event 
that additional revenues are obtained, will be used to pay 
commitments, which will protect the nation's credit. 
  Continuing this interview, Engineer Rahbari said: It is the 
Plan and Budget Commission's view that the finished costs of 
goods and services announced by the government are not that 
high, and that by adopting certain measures the finished costs 
can be reduced. 
  He added: In view of the presence of concerned specialists 
and existing resources, more reliance can be placed on domestic 
construction, and the finished cost can be reduced by reforming 
procedures, economizing, and creating more efficiency, 
productivity, and profitability, in order to make the pressure 
on the consumer just and logical. Because this measure is in the 
interest of the people, they will accept it. For this reason, 
all the price increases proposed by the government were not 
accepted by the Majles. 
  The Plan and Budget Commission member emphasized the fact 
that the Majles places great importance on solving the economic 
problems of the people. He added: To achieve this goal, the 
Majles increased the subsidies on some goods needed by the 
people. The amount of subsidies for drugs was increased from the 
government's proposed $330 million to $400 million, the 
subsidies for basic goods were increased from $695 million to 
$800 million, 220 billion-rials[R] credit was approved for 
education and training and R70 billion was approved for student 
scholarships and food. 
  He then discussed the credits allocated for the deprived 
areas. He said: The Majles added R50 billion to the credits for 
this sector. Credits were approved to provide water service in 
1,000 villages. The government proposed to provide electrical 
power to 500 villages, and the Majles increased this to 1,500 
villages. In addition, the Majles has provided for the expansion 
of electrical power in 300 cases. Likewise, the Majles has made 
provisions in next year's budget to install telephones in 500 
villages. He noted that to expand gas delivery service, the 
Majles allocated R100 billion for the year 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995]. 
  He emphasized: While the Majles has set out to economize, it 
is moving in the direction of implementing social justice.

  [Text] Economics Division. In the year 1371 [21 March 
1992-20 March 1993] 14,442 domestic companies with capital of 
about 342 billion rials[R] in 82 of the nation's cities were 
registered, representing increases of 2.8 percent in terms of 
numbers of companies and 44.3 percent in terms of capital over 
the year 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992]. 
  The Central Bank's Office of Economic Statistics reports 
that 
in 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] 1,706 domestic companies 
with capital in excess of R20.4 billion were officially 
dissolved, representing increases of 1.4 percent in terms of 
numbers and 157.6 percent in terms of capital compared to 1370 
[21 March 1991-20 March 1992]. 
  Based on this report, last year 36 foreign companies with 
capital of more than R1.626.1 trillion were registered, a 
2.17-percent decrease in terms on numbers compared to 1370 [21 
March 1991-20 March 1992]. 
  Of the total number of registered companies, 50.1 percent 
are 
corporations, 41.5 percent are limited partnerships, and 7.7 
percent are cooperatives. 
  This report adds that of the total number of companies 
registered in 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993], about 28.1 
percent was in the construction sector, 32.4 percent was in the 
industrial sector, 19.4 percent was in the commercial sector, 
13.6 percent was in the credit institution, insurance, brokerage 
and commercial services sector, and the remaining 10.8 percent 
was in other economic activities. 
  Likewise, the percentage of registered companies whose 
dissolution was announced in 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] 
was 12 percent in terms of numbers and 3.3 percent in terms of 
capital. 
  This report adds that after Tehran the cities ranking 
highest 
in numbers of registered companies were Esfahan, Ahvaz, Mashhad, 
Shiraz, Tabriz, Urmia, Bandar 'Abbas, Kerman, and Kermanshah, 
and that after Tehran the cities ranking highest in terms of the 
total capital of their registered companies were Bandar 'Abbas, 
Mashhad, Esfahan, Kashan, Shiraz, Yazd, Tabriz, Ahvaz, and Urmia.

  [Text] Economic Division. The greatest factor in the rapid 
increase in the market price of foreign exchange over the last 
two weeks is the failure to open draft credit accounts for 
factories in the banking system and their turning to the open 
market. 
  Other factors in the increase in the foreign exchange rate 
on 
the market were the approaching New Year's holidays, planning 
for travel, and turning to the market to procure foreign 
exchange, conversion of the cash of government factories, 
companies and institutions to foreign exchange for future 
purchases, and the creation of a psychological mood to make 
profits. 
  The above was announced yesterday in an interview with 
RESALAT's parliamentary correspondent by Engineer Seyyed 
'Alinaqi Khamushi, Majles deputy from Tehran and chief of the 
Iran Chamber of Commerce and Industries. He gave an expert 
analysis of the reasons and factors in the instability of the 
foreign exchange market in recent months, and he criticized and 
studied the Central Bank's policies in this regard. 
<H5>  Reduced Foreign Exchange Revenues in the Current Year </H5>
  Eng. Khamushi began by discussing the roots of this problem. 
He said: In the First Five-Year Plan foreign exchange and 
revenue sources and expenses were taken into account, but in 
practice the expenses were as predicted while the revenues did 
not come in, and there was a scandalous deficit. The second 
question is the manner of using financial resources. If debts 
are studied it will be clear that 70 to 80 percent of them are 
short-term and about 20 percent are long-term, and this in 
itself has created escalating problems for the country. 
  Continuing, he said: Another problem concerns the revenues 
anticipated from the sale of oil, which are far removed from 
reality. For example, in the current year government revenues 
from the sale of oil are about $3 to $4 billion less than 
anticipated, and this figure will create problems for the 
nation's economic ability. 
<H5>  Excessive But Nonessential Imports </H5>
  Eng. Khamushi then discussed the problems caused by the 
procedures for allocating foreign exchange. He said: Based on 
legislation from the Third Majles, the Foreign Exchange 
Allocation Committee divided approved credits from the very 
beginning according to sectors. In order to spend the 
allocations approved for that year the government organizations 
consumed and imported in cases where it was not necessary 
without taking priorities into account. 
  He also added: Most of this consumption and importing was in 
the commercial sector and in government imports of manufactured 
goods, most of which did not have priority. Currently many of 
these goods are gradually being put on the market, yet there has 
been absolutely no need for some time to import some of these 
goods. 
  Continuing, the chief of the Chamber of Commerce discussed 
the way the banking system allocates foreign exchange. He said: 
Since the time the foreign exchange rate was allowed to float 
and the various banks were authorized to open credit accounts 
for goods, any kind of policy or priority in the country went 
off the boards, and some goods were imported in abundance into 
the country without taking necessities into account. This caused 
the amount of foreign exchange earned through oil exports to 
become imbalanced in relation to the nation's import needs and 
it brought us up against a shortage of foreign exchange. This 
caused the price of foreign exchange, which is like a commodity 
on the market, to increase. 
<H5>  Injecting Foreign Exchange Into the Market </H5>
  Eng. Khamushi criticized the Central Bank's injection of 
foreign exchange into the market. He said: At the outset the 
Central Bank announced that there are no limitations of any kind 
on the insertion of floating foreign exchange into the market, 
without taking into account the extent of market struggle and 
demand. After some time they realized that no matter how much 
foreign exchange is injected into the market, there is still a 
struggle and that doing this is a mistake. 
  He added: Before they imposed restrictions, they paid $5,000 
to anyone with a passport, and it reached the point where this 
procedure brought the nation's foreign exchange consumption up 
to $70 million per week. This is one of those mistakes that were 
made without paying attention to the market pulse and its 
struggles. During the period when this procedure was in effect, 
about $1 billion was injected into the foreign exchange market, 
while at the same time the figures on opening credit accounts 
had fallen to less than $10,000 and we were faced with 
nonpayment. This can in reality be called a foreign exchange 
disaster and a banking system disaster that brought the country 
face-to-face with a problem. 
  In the same regard the chief of the Chamber of Commerce 
added: When the banking system officials took notice and stopped 
this practice it was already too late and we were faced with the 
failure to make payments, and this failure to make payments has 
continued for a little over a year, is still going on, and has 
created a serious problem for the country. It has caused foreign 
banks to refuse to accept credit accounts because of the failure 
to make payments. To solve their problem, importers, most of 
which are factories, have resorted to importing without the 
transfer of foreign exchange. Doing this means disrupting supply 
and demand and the result of that is also to increase the price 
of foreign exchange. 
  Continuing, Eng. Khamushi said: This measure was adopted 
about three months ago, and the practice continued for some 
time. Gradually the currency changers took over the work of the 
banks. Goods were paid to the money seller for the transfer of 
foreign exchange, and goods were imported. In negotiations with 
the Central Bank we brought the bank to the conclusion that this 
was a mistake and that the bank must do this work. Before the 
bank adopted this measure the price of the dollar at the bank 
was 1,750 rials[R] and it was R2,300 on the market. As soon as 
the bank agreed to do the work on drafts, the floating foreign 
exchange rate dropped from R2,300 to about R2,000 and this trend 
has continued for four months. 
<H5>  Registration of Many Orders and the Central Bank's Decision </H5>
  The chief of the Chamber of Commerce then discussed a recent 
improper decision by the banking system. He said: A procedure 
that was adopted by the banking system was a mistake that was 
made due to the effects of excessive orders registered in the 
Ministry of Commerce. When the Central Bank was unable to open 
credit accounts for these orders, the bank suddenly decided to 
rescind them. It announced to the applicants that there was no 
ability to open credit accounts. As soon as the bank announced 
this decision and it became known in the market, all the 
applicants turned to the market and the market price of foreign 
exchange increased. 
  Eng. Khamushi discussed the solution to the current foreign 
exchange market problems. He said: To reach an immediate result 
and stop this current trend, the banking system should continue 
the same system of drafts that was being used until three weeks 
ago. It should continue this until the day the opening of credit 
accounts returns to normal and the banks accept the opening of 
credit accounts. Priority should be given to factories, 
machinery, and raw materials until this huge volume of demand 
can be removed from the market and the bank can stop the rise in 
the price of foreign exchange. 
<H5>  Agreement Between Iran and Germany Concerning Debts </H5>
  In conclusion, the chief of the Chamber of Commerce said: 
Just as was announced, negotiations were held with Germany 
concerning the suspension of debts and the movement towards 
normalization of relations with this country has begun. It is 
very likely that the negotiations with Japanese officials will 
also conclude by the end of the week. Negotiations will also be 
held in turn with other European countries. This will be a step 
towards returning the situation with opening credit accounts to 
normal. If the banking system does not increase the foreign 
exchange rate and if it does not create unwanted inflation, and 
if it works with drafts until the opening of credit accounts is 
normalized, then the foreign exchange rate on the free market 
will decrease, the difference between the bank's foreign 
exchange rate and that of the free market will be reduced, and 
the situation on the foreign exchange market will return to 
normal.

  [Text] Note. In view of the importance and sensitivity of 
the Court of Administrative Justice in the judiciary and in the 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, we set out to 
interview Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Ferdowsipur, chief of 
this court, concerning this judiciary entity's accomplishments 
and procedures. What follows is the result of the interview. 
With thanks to him, we present the text of the interview for our 
esteemed readers. 
  [RESALAT] What are the limitations and responsibilities of 
the Court of Administrative Justice? Was its formation an 
innovation by the Islamic Republic, or did it have a precedent? 
  [Ferdowsipur] Ferdowsipur began by detailing the duties in 
the short history of the Court of Administrative Justice. He 
said: The Court of Administrative Justice actually exercises 
supervision over government administrative offices, units, 
organizations, and entities. It also deals with grievances from 
the public concerning guidelines and charters. It is a source of 
pride for the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran that we 
also have a substitute magistrate. If the chief justice is sick 
or on vacation, that magistrate can manage the branch court. 
Every branch court has an office manager, and it also has a 
secretary who helps register and distribute complaints and 
judgments. We have two review councils composed of five judges, 
and the chief of this court is the general chief of the court. 
The other four judges are chosen every six months in ballot 
voting by the chiefs of the branch courts, and they study the 
cases. One of the benefits of our constitution is the enactment 
of this same Article 173 concerning the formation of the Court 
of Administrative Justice. 
  In previous governments we did not have such organizations 
and supervision over government offices. Of course, there was a 
legal body called the administrative council, but this 
administrative council was never established and implemented. 
  After the great revolution of France, an Administrative 
Council Law was passed to supervise the work of the government. 
This council began its work under the supervision of the 
legislative power. According to them, this supervision has been 
successful so far. It is also the same way in England, except 
that it is under the supervision of the judiciary power. We do 
not have such supervision in other countries. 
  [RESALAT] Must the plaintiff or the complaints definitely 
come from the people? 
  [Ferdowsipur] If we refer to the proceedings of the Assembly 
of Experts we see that after this article was proposed debates 
occurred. In their remarks concerning the Court of 
Administrative Justice, some of the gentlemen paid no attention 
to the characteristics of the Court of Administrative Justice. 
However, Mr. Hashemi, president of the republic, gave a talk in 
which he said: "I, myself, was a defender of the Court of 
Administrative Justice, and my view was that we ought to have a 
powerful and authoritative organization to supervise the 
authoritative government organizations, one that will act with 
full power and decisiveness." 
  The first session of the Court of Administrative Justice 
took 
place at the Higher Martyr Motahari School, chaired by Mr. 
Emami-Kashani. Because it was a newly established entity, they 
chose the best judges. The offices of chief of the Court of 
Administrative Justice were held by Grand Ayatollahs Rezvani, 
Feyz-Gilani, Musavi-Tabrizi, and Hojjat ol-Eslam Abbasifard. We 
have three pillars in the court, the plaintiff, the defendant 
(in the Court of Administrative Justice the plaintiff and the 
plaintiff side must definitely come from the people), in the 
sense that if the government, or the government office or 
institution or the prosecutor want to complain, it will be 
rejected in the court. 
  He added: The defendant must definitely be the government, 
meaning the ministries, the district governor's offices, the 
general offices, the government organizations and any 
organization that procures the salaries for its workers through 
the government. Therefore, the Veteran's Foundation, the Martyr 
Foundation, and other foundations affiliated with the 
government, which are supervised by the president of the 
republic, the municipalities, the Urban Land Organization, and 
the seven-person councils can also be the defendants for 
complaints. 
  The third pillar is the question of complaints, and this 
goes 
back to administrative violations, i.e., if any worker violates 
the laws and regulations, which pertain to his work, and if a 
complaint is lodged by someone about the violation, we will 
investigate these complaints. 
  [RESALAT] In what way are illegal guidelines investigated 
and 
voided? 
  [Ferdowsipur] If illegal guidelines are issued by the 
ministries or offices of governors-general and if someone 
complains about them, they are investigated, and if it is 
determined that they are illegal, the order to void them is 
issued. If we do not determine that it is illegal or if we have 
doubts, we seek an opinion from the Guardian Council. 
  If the interested party complains about guidelines, letters 
of enactment, and charters, and guidelines for government 
organizations and centers, which is illegal, we are required to 
attend to it, and what we do is announce that it is illegal and 
order it nullified, or we announce that it is not illegal and 
issue a verdict of affirmation. 
  [RESALAT] In what way can the people complain about 
government organizations, foundations, and municipalities? 
  [Ferdowsipur] Our petitions have specific forms that are 
sold 
at the post offices in all the cities. The people can obtain the 
petition forms from the post offices, and the procedure for 
complaining is given on these forms. 
  [RESALAT] What is the procedure for appealing and protesting 
the court's opinions? 
  [Ferdowsipur] After the verdict is issued, if it is against 
the defendant, he has up to two months to protest and request an 
appeal. After we receive the information we study the request 
for appeal. Here either the original verdict is upheld and 
distributed for implementation or it is ruled deficient and sent 
to another court at the same level for reconsideration. 
  [RESALAT] How many judges and branch courts deal with the 
cases? 
  [Ferdowsipur] There were formerly 10 branch courts. This 
Court of Administrative Justice now has 20 branches. The chief 
of each branch is an experienced and committed judge with a 
record of service, and there is also a consultant. Likewise, 
after the verdict is approved on appeal it is distributed for 
implementation. If the verdict is against the defendant, the 
person who has executive responsibility and against whom the 
verdict was issued must carry out the verdict. 
  [RESALAT] What happens if he does not carry out the verdict? 
  [Ferdowsipur] We issue a reminder, and if he pays no 
attention we have a legal article called Article 21, which 
allows the branch court of the Court of Administrative Justice 
to terminate the employment of the executive official who 
refuses to carry out the verdict. This termination is in 
proportion to the violation, which has been committed. 
  [RESALAT] What will happen if an executive official in a 
higher position does not carry out the verdict? For example, 
what will happen if the mayor of one of the districts of Tehran 
is convicted in the Court of Administrative Justice, but the 
mayor of Tehran, who is a higher executive official, does not 
carry out the verdict concerning his mayor from the court of 
justice? 
  [Ferdowsipur] The implementation of the verdict pertains to 
the highest ranking executive official in that organization. For 
example, if we order the dismissal of the mayor of a district, 
the general mayor must implement it and if he does not, the 
highest level executive official, meaning the president of the 
republic, can do this. 
  I told the chief of the branch court to carry out the law in 
accordance with the regulations he has and to coordinate it with 
me wherever he encounters problems. I coordinate with the 
highest ranking executive official to carry out that verdict. 
  For example, regarding the position of president of one of 
the universities, we had a verdict on a complaint received from 
one of the professors of the university, which was issued for 
the professor and against that university. We had to implement 
Article 21, because this verdict was not implemented for about 
two years. I got in touch with the minister of culture and 
higher education and told him we have such prerogatives. I 
believe that we should not do such a thing without coordinating 
with the highest level executive official. He welcomed this, and 
because he was not familiar with the case the files were given 
to him to familiarize him with its details. He said that they 
would implement the verdict themselves if possible, and if not 
we were free to do as we wished under the law, and this is just 
what we did. 
  [RESALAT] Where has the case gotten now regarding the 
dismissal of one of Tehran's regional mayors and his failure to 
obey the verdict from the court of justice? 
  [Ferdowsipur] In this regard I have also heard that that 
official for the municipal district was sentenced to termination 
of employment. However, to keep from executing the verdict, they 
resorted to starting a rumor that he had been pardoned by the 
exalted leader. Then when Mr. 'Abbasifard told Ayatollah Yazdi, 
Ayatollah Yazdi said that he was the one who recommends pardons; 
how could this person have been pardoned by the exalted leader 
without me knowing? It is, therefore, nothing more than a rumor. 
Then they realized that the truth had been discovered. They 
worked in secret for a time and then were forced to carry out 
the order to dismiss the mayor of that district. 
  [RESALAT] Do you have stronger procedures under 
consideration 
to carry out the orders of the Court of Administrative Justice? 
  [Ferdowsipur] I have coordinated this subject with the 
minister of justice, with Ayatollah Yazdi, with other officials, 
with the Majles, and with the Article 90 Commission so they will 
support our verdicts so we can implement our verdicts 
decisively. God willing, we hope the issue will not arise. 
Second, if such a thing happens we will act in accordance with 
rules and regulations. 
  [RESALAT] What is the difference between the General Council 
of the Court of Administrative Justice and the Supreme Court? 
  [Ferdowsipur] Another organization we have is the General 
Council of the Court of Administrative Justice. This council 
meets once a week on Saturday. Verdicts that contradict each 
other are presented in this council. That is, if two similar 
complaints are presented in two branch courts and the issued 
verdicts are in conflict, these complaints are sent to this 
council to resolve the conflict. After a review, if it is 
decided that there is a conflict, a new vote is then taken on 
which verdict is correct. There is a general council both on the 
Court of Administrative Justice and on the Supreme Court, and it 
has law-making status, meaning that opinions issued by this 
general council have the force of law. The same is true of the 
national Supreme court, although the area of competence of each 
is different. 
  [RESALAT] In the Court of Administrative Justice, may those 
who lack the credentials of an attorney represent the two sides 
in the consideration of the complaints? 
  [Ferdowsipur] The interested party or his attorney may make 
the complaint. Of course, the attorney must be qualified and a 
member of the Attorney's Society. 
  [RESALAT] Is it compulsory or optional to have an attorney 
at 
the Court of Administrative Justice? 
  [Ferdowsipur] This issue was raised at a meeting of judicial 
officials and a decision was made that the attorney must be 
required. Of course, if the party himself does not want to get 
an attorney and says he will defend himself, we will not accept 
this and at the time of the trial officials must obtain a 
government attorney for him, because this is their right unless 
he himself has no interest. 
  [RESALAT] What are the statistics on the court's backlogs 
and 
verdicts issued? 
  [Ferdowsipur] Answering, the chief of the Court of 
Administrative Justice said: The total case backlog in all 
branch courts is 1,000 to 1,100 cases. About 100 cases arrive at 
each branch court each month. 
  One of the distinctions of the Court of Administrative 
Justice is that every branch court is required to hear 70 cases 
month, meaning it must issue a verdict on them. If the number is 
less than this the court is reprimanded. If the number is 
between 70 and 120, in accordance with a measure we have this 
year it receives a commission. For the branch courts, which hear 
more than 120 cases, we give a prize to the three highest, and 
we have a court that completes 300 cases per month. Sometimes, 
however, when a case takes too long it is not the fault of the 
court of justice, because we must send one copy of the plea to 
the defendant, and sometimes the defendant does not answer for 
up to six months. 
  [RESALAT] How far has the work on the seven-person land 
investigation councils gone? 
  [Ferdowsipur] The work on the seven-person councils has been 
completed in the court. Of course, we have cases for which a 
verdict has not yet been issued, and they will also be heard. 
However, the final verdict will be given by a council designated 
by the Interests Discernment Council consisting of a judge 
confirmed by the chief of the judiciary, a Majles deputy 
confirmed by the speaker of the Majles, and a person chosen and 
confirmed by the minister of agriculture. These three people are 
a council, and they must study all the cases of the seven-person 
councils that have ended here with the issuance of a verdict. 
  Recently a set of guidelines for these councils was 
presented 
at a meeting of judicial power officials by the minister of 
justice and was approved. The three-person councils will be 
formed to deal with these kinds of cases in order to determine 
their outcome. 
  [RESALAT] In conclusion, do you have any special 
recommendations for the public and for the two parties to a case? 
  [Ferdowsipur] Some complaints are time consuming. The 
complaint is rejected and they complain at another court, 
meaning they present their complaints several times. It would be 
better for people like this to consult with a judge or a lawyer 
to deal with the problem. A judge is not anyone's family. When 
he issues a verdict the right to protest is retained for 
individuals, but when the verdict is finalized it must be 
obeyed. Send individuals to give advice which, in the words of 
His Holiness the Imam (peace be upon him), will be plastered on 
the walls.

  [Text] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed has warned the 
nations of the South about the emerging tendency among developed 
nations to impose a global minimum wage scheme. This will erode 
the competitive edge that developing countries currently enjoy. 
The prime minister raised this issue today during the plenary 
session of the fourth G-15 summit meeting in New Delhi. 
  Briefing Malaysian journalists, Foreign Minister Datuk 
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said he regarded the prime minister's 
statement as an early warning for developing countries so they 
are not caught up in what is seemingly a very attractive scheme 
to protect the interests of workers. He said Datuk Sri Dr. 
Mahathir pointed out that such a scheme is not advantageous to 
them. The economies of developing countries economies would be 
destroyed. They would lose their competitive edge and 
ultimately be confronted with a severe unemployment problem. 
The only advantage that developing countries currently have is 
cheap labor. This has enabled them to develop their economies 
and produce goods at a much cheaper price. On the other hand, 
the developed nations have numerous advantages, such as capital, 
skilled manpower, and modern technology. 
  Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir told leaders at the session that if 
they are forced to accept the global minimum wage scheme, their 
economies will be continuously harmed. Although the scheme 
looks good on the surface, it will not be beneficial because it 
will ultimately lead to the closing of factories and bring about 
unemployment. He also pointed out that the standard of living 
is low in the developing countries and should therefore not be 
compared with the developed nations. He considered the move to 
impose a global minimum wage a protectionist policy against the 
developing countries, regardless of whether such a policy is 
linked to issues of democracy, the environment, or human rights. 
  Datuk Abdullah said the prime minister also welcomed the 
issue raised by the Senegalese President Abdou Diouf with regard 
to the Western media. The president believes the Western media 
does not present an accurate picture of the nations of the 
South, particularly the African states. The media only 
highlights negative aspects. Malaysia truly understands the 
sentiments expressed by the Senegalese leader. 
  The current leaders of the G-15 are holding an unofficial 
meeting with representatives of leaders who are unable to attend 
the summit.

  [Text] Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign 
affairs, has said the world has witnessed the most grotesque 
crime of this century. Al-Hasan was alluding to the massacre of 
innocent worshipers at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque during the 
blessed month of Ramadan. He said in our view and in view of 
the world, the massacre proved the racist settler trend 
continues to hold sway in Israel, finding support, cover, and 
facilities and revealing the bad conditions of the Palestinian 
people under occupation. 
  Al-Hasan said Israeli crimes continued after the Hebron 
massacre. The least occurred the day before yesterday, and was 
committed by Israel after the issuance of Resolution 904, in 
contempt of all rules of international legitimacy and human 
values. 
  In a speech at the opening of the 101st session of the Arab 
League council that began in Cairo today, al-Hasan said this 
grotesque crime explains to us the importance of the unified 
Arab stand in affirming the condemnation of Israel and exposing 
its intentions, and the need to coordinate among the brothers to 
confront challenges and dangers. 
  Al-Hasan said: In Jordan, we moved on Arab and international 
levels. We contacted permanent and other members of the UN 
Security Council. The condemnation of the crime was made plain. 
We demanded protection for the unarmed Palestinian people. We 
asked the international community to shoulder its 
responsibilities and affirmed the need to remove Israeli 
settlements from the occupied Arab territories.

  [Excerpt] Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat has called 
for an urgent meeting of the PLO leadership in Tunis today to 
discuss the peace process and the developments in the occupied 
Arab territories after eight Palestinians were killed 
distributing leaflets in Gaza and 47 others were wounded by 
Israeli occupation gunfire. 'Arafat described the incident as a 
new massacre. He said: We are facing a secret organization 
from inside the Israeli Army and the settlers, which seeks to 
destroy the peaceful solution. 
  The Palestinian president said he informed Washington and 
Moscow, in their capacity as the sponsors of the peace 
negotiations, about the incident and said the PLO will present a 
memorandum to the Security Council in this regard. 'Arafat 
stressed that the Israeli Army and Government are blamed for 
such attacks against the Palestinian people. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Geneva, March 26 (AFP) -- Ministers of the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed here 
Saturday [26 March] to keep their current production ceiling 
unchanged until year-end, OPEC Secretary General Dr Subroto said. 
  Saudi Arabia thus overruled a bid by Iran and other non-Gulf 
members, including Indonesia, to reduce the ceiling from its 
present level of 24.52 million barrels a day (MBD) to bolster 
weak oil prices, delegates said. 
  Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazir told reporters "it was the 
best we could do under the circumstances." 
  Nazir declined to say what the impact could be on oil 
prices. 
  Ahmed Said al-Badi, of the United Arab Emirates, said the 
decision was a unanimous one and the Libyan minister, Abdalla 
al-Badri, said he was "not happy" with the outcome.

  [Text] Kuwait, 28 Mar -- Kuwait today stressed that the 
brotherly relations between the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council 
(Persian Gulf)] states are deep and strong. 
  A responsible source in the Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry denied 
that the first deputy prime minister and minister of foreign 
affairs, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, had indicated during a press 
conference in Cairo yesterday that the subject of some GCC 
states' relations with the Iraqi regime would be discussed by 
the council. 
  In a statement to Kuna, the source said "that Shaykh Sabah 
had explained in reply to a question in this regard during the 
above-mentioned press conference that diplomatic relations 
between these states and Iraq had not been severed at all so 
that they could be restored" and that this was exactly what 
Sabah had said. 
  On the other hand, the source expressed his regret at 
Sudan's 
continued failure to condemn the Iraqi regime's aggression 
against Kuwait and its failure to demand that Iraq should abide 
by the legitimate UN resolutions related to that aggression. 
  The source said that Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad's meeting in 
Cairo 
yesterday with Sudanese Foreign Minister Dr. Husayn Abu Salih 
was confined to a discussion of the item on the agenda of the 
Arab League meeting which was concerned with the southern Sudan. 
  Here the source was commenting on what Radio Monte Carlo had 
broadcast quoting a Sudanese diplomat in Cairo who said that the 
meeting had dealt with the subject of what he claimed to be one 
hundred thousand Sudanese who had been working in Kuwait.

  [Text] In reaction to the attack in Petah Tiqva, Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres said today that such incidents are part 
of the current Israeli security situation. He made the remark 
at the opening of a fund-raising campaign at the Tel Aviv 
Museum. Our correspondent Eyal Eisenstein reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Eisenstein] The stabbing in Petah Tiqva 
was nationalistic in nature. It is an inseparable part of the 
overall current situation, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said 
today. More people will be hurt and murdered, Peres said, if we 
do not bring about a basic change in the situation. 
  [Peres] This is yet another terrible bloody incident, part 
of the current situation. I do not believe that the incidents, 
the stabbings, the killings, can be stopped without basically 
changing the situation. Courage is needed to see things as they 
are, to see their roots, and to reach the necessary conclusions. 
  [Eisenstein] Regarding the impact of last night's incidents 
in Jabalyah on the political process, Peres said that the 
killing of the six members of the Fatah Hawks will make the 
talks very difficult, but they will open today and continue. 
Peres added that he is certain the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
soldiers who killed the Gazans had no malicious intentions and 
acted responsibly. We are only clever after the fact, the 
foreign minister said. 
  [Peres] Primarily, I have every respect for the soldiers who 
serve under impossible conditions. I believe that we should 
offer the Army a political solution before we pass judgment on 
their military performance. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by Dan </F>
Margalit in the studio -- live] 
  [Text] [Margalit] We have just heard on IDF Radio that 
the delegation leaving for Cairo consists of only Major General 
Amnon Shahaq's group. Does this mean the Palestinians want to 
slow down the negotiations on Gaza-Jericho First? 
  [Peres] I am not certain this report is correct or official. 
The delegation will be able to deal with the issue of Hebron as 
well as the issue of resuming the negotiations on Gaza and 
Jericho. It has been decided that the parties will first 
discuss the issue of security in Hebron and, if they reach 
agreement, they will immediately move on to the issue of Gaza 
and Jericho. I hope they will reach an agreement. 
  [Margalit] How many Palestinian policemen are we willing to 
allow into Gaza, Jericho, and Hebron; and how many Norwegian 
observers, for example? 
  [Peres] This is precisely what we will tell the Palestinians 
tomorrow. I would not like to state it on television now. 
  [Margalit] What does it really matter whether there will be 
20 or 200 Norwegians? Either we trust them, or we do not. 
  [Peres] Basically, we trust the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. 
It is in charge of security in Hebron. We make supreme efforts 
to prevent friction, to take the other side's needs into 
consideration as well. We would not really want to set up three 
equal forces in Hebron. At the same time, we agree to bring in 
an international presence -- as we pledged in the Declaration of 
Principles with regard to Gaza and Jericho. The figure is 
important. It will determine whether it is a presence or more 
than that. 
  [Margalit] Who will command the Palestinian policemen in 
Hebron, for example? 
  [Peres] Overall and supreme responsibility over issues of 
security will remain in the hands of the IDF. 
  [Margalit] But, there will be situations, such as the one we 
saw on television, in which settlers fire their guns. Can 
Palestinian policemen fire at them, or will they first have to 
ask the permission of Gen. Mufaz? 
  [Peres] It is not as simple as that. We want to prevent 
contact between the two altogether. I suppose that the 
Palestinian police will guard Muslim and Arab sites, and there 
will also be joint patrols. As a whole, the IDF will have the 
overall and supreme responsibility. 
  [Margalit] If you want to prevent friction, you must ban the 
settlers from going to the marketplace in Hebron, because it is 
not clear whether we should protect them or protect other people 
from them. 
  [Peres] This is not the only alternative; you can have two 
access routes, one for the settlers, the other for the Arabs. 
We seek solutions for the complicated situation, as you pointed 
out. 
  [Margalit] Speaking on this issue, are you for or against 
the settlers staging a march in Hebron [on 30 April]? 
  [Peres] I certainly oppose it. Who needs it? 
  [Margalit] How about a rally? 
  [Peres] Look, one of the worst things to have happened, 
other than the Cave of the Patriarchs incident, is the incessant 
appearances of the those people on the international media. One 
may have the impression that the Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza 
settlers control the State of Israel. They use extremist 
language, painting a picture of an nearly unrecognizable Israel. 
The situation is incredibly tense; there is enormous anger; 
nothing has calmed yet. Who needs this rally? What for? 
Against what? What does it serve? 
  [Margalit] It is against the government policy, which is 
their democratic right. 
  [Peres] You can stage demonstrations against the government 
policy in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. You do not stage 
demonstrations in tense and hurting places. There is a limit. 
Look, everything is allowed; I could come into your house and 
pull you out [as heard]. The question is what do we do when the 
situation is very tense; when there is a lot of friction; when 
some people use their arms illegally; what do we do to reduce 
the tension? 
  [Margalit] Would the friction not have been better reduced 
by pulling out the settlers from the heart of Hebron, not Qiryat 
Arba', but Bet Hadassah and Tal al-Rumaythah? 
  [Peres] I do not know. I will not say anything on this 
matter outside the cabinet sessions. We are in the midst of 
negotiations, not only with ourselves. Anything you say 
immediately turns into a concession before negotiations were 
even held. Being a member of the cabinet, I believe that the 
only place for me to discuss such issues is the cabinet session. 
I suggest that we do not task the IDF with this matter. I 
expect the members of the cabinet to have the courage to ask how 
to construct a situation which would minimize friction and 
clashes, while securing the life of people of all sides, 
settlers as well as Arabs. 
  [Margalit] Assuming that the, so called, security package is 
wrapped up -- that is, the first stage of the Palestinian police 
and Norwegian observers entry into three regions in the 
territories -- when do you believe, will the Gaza and Jericho 
stage of the negotiations be over? 
  [Peres] It depends. If we reach the agreement on providing 
a feeling of security in Hebron tomorrow and begin discussing 
Gaza and Jericho the next day, and if the delegates sit all next 
week -- day and night -- in an accelerated process of 
negotiations, we can finish the whole thing in two to three 
weeks. 
  [Margalit] But, as we just heard, the PLO wants negotiations 
to start only when the security package is wrapped up. 
  [Peres] I hope they will end it tomorrow. 
  [Margalit] Are we that close? 
  [Peres] I believe so. The gaps are such that I believe they 
could be bridged. We can end discussing the issue of Hebron 
tomorrow evening or night, and make an agreement. Then, we will 
be able to immediately begin discussing Gaza and Jericho the 
very next day. At the same time, we were to begin discussing 
economic issues, but the PLO announced that it wants to begin 
discussing this next Sunday. Let me tell you: Any delay in the 
beginning of the discussions, will naturally lead to a delayed 
conclusion. 
  [Margalit] Finance Minister Shohat said today, however, that 
the economic agreement is ready, and if it was not for the Cave 
of the Patriarchs massacre, it would have been signed by now. 
  [Peres] I believe there are some issues that need to be 
agreed on; there is agreement on some things, and disagreement 
on others. Negotiations are still called for. 
  [Margalit] Would it not have been more convenient had we 
been in the midst of negotiations with Syria? 
  [Peres] I believe that we must first end the matter of Gaza 
and Jericho. We must first crate a piece of new Palestinian 
reality. Nothing will change the situation in the Middle East 
more than a change in the physical reality. Making another 
declaration, statement, or appearance is unimportant. We are 
pretty close, I believe, to turning the Oslo agreement into a 
new political reality. After this, we will have to start the 
Syrian issue. 
  [Margalit] Not before? Not at the same time? Last week we 
heard al-Asad saying that if Rabin wants peace in the north, he 
should come and make an arrangement. 
  [Peres] I do not know where he was quoted.... 
  [Margalit] It made the headlines. 
  [Peres] Another headline.... If he opens the negotiations, 
they will open and right now. We are putting off nothing. It 
should be understood that peace is not made between leaders 
only; it is peace between peoples. Negotiations involve both 
nations. In any event, our people have to see, in no uncertain 
terms, that the Syrians are really willing to enter full 
negotiations for full peace. 
  [Margalit] Mr. Peres, do you agree with the prime minister 
that, in its deliberations, the Shamgar commission causes damage 
to the IDF? 
  [Peres] It certainly causes problems. I would not like to 
reach conclusions about the commission before it reaches its own 
conclusions about what happened, but it is very problematic. 
The Army officers must prepare and be ready for their 
appearances, explain, worry, and convince others. This is very 
difficult.

  [Text] Tehran, March 27 (AFP) -- An Islamic newspaper on 
Sunday accused Armenians of shooting down the Iranian plane 
which crashed in war-torn Nagorno-Karabakh killing 34 people and 
criticised the government for its silence. 
  "All the evidence shows that Armenia is responsible for the 
tragedy, the most important of which is the fact that the site 
of the crash is occupied by Armenian forces," JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI 
said. 
  The C-130 Hercules transport plane was carrying 13 crew 
members and 19 relatives of Iranian diplomats in Moscow when it 
crashed March 17 near Stepanakert, capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, 
an Armenian-majority enclave in Azerbaijan fighting for 
independence since 1988. 
  The plane was on a flight from Moscow to Tehran. 
  Armenians and Azerbaijanis have accused each other of 
shooting down the plane, but Tehran has remained silent pending 
an investigation. 
  Iranian foreign ministry and air force experts have visited 
the crash site to investigate the incident. 
  However, Tehran Radio said Sunday that the investigation 
committee had not been able to find the plane's black box. 
  The team met Armenian Vice President Gagik Arutyunyan in 
Yerevan on Saturday and were to leave for Georgia on Sunday and 
then on to Azerbaijan to continue their investigation. 
  A foreign ministry official said last week that the plane 
had 
exploded in mid-air, denying earlier reports that the crash 
resulted from technical problems. 
  The daily JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI, close to Islamic hardliners, 
criticised the ministry for keeping silent and urged it to 
"reveal the truth and not allow the Armenian crime to be 
eclipsed." 
  It also urged the government to pressure the Armenians into 
accepting responsibility for the "crime" and compensating the 
relatives of the victims. 
  Meanwhile, the English-language TEHRAN TIMES blamed the war 
over Nagorno-Karabakh for the "spilling of Iranian blood" in the 
crash and urged Armenians to show "goodwill" in accepting an 
Iranian-mediated settlement. 
  More than 20,000 people have been killed in six years of 
fighting between Armenians and Azerbaijani forces. Iran has 
launched several peace initiatives but without success.

  [Text] The Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi has 
described as unjustified the hue and cry raised by India on the 
reports of the provision of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan. A press 
release issued by the High Commission has referred to the joint 
communique issued in 1981 after the visit to Pakistan of the 
then Indian external affairs minister and the present prime 
minister, Narasimha Rao. In the communique, both sides endorsed 
each other's right to acquire weapons for their defense. As 
India has already acquired a large quantity of arms, it should 
not sense any threat from Pakistan. The press release further 
states that the F-16 issue, payment for which has already been 
made, concerns Pakistan and the United States. The press 
release also gives a reminder of the fact that Pakistan has 
never tried to have any influence on the acquisition of arms by 
India, although the acquisition of such arms has altered the 
balance of power in the region. Pakistan has always tried to 
maintain a balance in conventional arms and has supported a ban 
on the acquisition and installation of weapons of mass 
destruction and has also submitted several proposals in this 
regard. The press release asks India to hold constructive talks 
with Pakistan so as to ensure peace and stability in the region 
instead of indulging in arguments and debates.

  [Text] Amman -- His Majesty King Husayn Monday [28 March] 
linked Jordan's return to Middle East peace negotiations to 
lifting a three-year siege of the Port of al-'Aqabah and 
adopting a "new way of dealing with the Hashemite Kingdom of 
Jordan." 
  The King told the ambassadors of the five permanent members 
of the United Nations Security Council that Jordan's resumption 
of peace negotiations with Israel was contingent on the 
immediate resolving of this "completely unacceptable situation 
and adopting a new way of cooperating with the Hashemite Kingdom 
of Jordan." 
  A statement released by the International Press Office at 
the 
Royal Court said: "His Majesty King Husayn called to his office 
at the Royal Court today the ambassadors of the five permanent 
members of the United Nations Security Council to inform them in 
very clear terms of the pressures and aggravation Jordan faces 
due to the blockade imposed on the Port of al-'Aqabah. 
  "His Majesty said that since the outbreak of the Gulf 
crisis, 
the blockade has resulted in great losses with negative 
repercussions on the Jordanian economy, in addition to the 
suffering of Jordanian citizens and the losses endured by the 
commercial sector in Jordan. His Majesty said that it is odd 
that the such sanctions and such harassment are imposed solely 
on Jordan and not any other country in the region. 
  "His Majesty explained to the ambassadors that since the 
outbreak of the Gulf crisis naval bodies concerned with the 
implementation of the sanctions have inspected more than 1,700 
ships bound for the Gulf of Aqaba. The inspections failed to 
find any violations of the sanctions or of their cause or aim. 
His Majesty stressed that not only are these sanctions and the 
resulting harassments at odds with the historical role that 
Jordan has assumed in order to achieve security, stability and 
growth in the region, but also are a direct affront to Jordan's 
dignity and a violation of to rights. [sentence as published] 
  "His Majesty stressed that from now on the resumption of 
Jordan's involvement in the peace-making process to establish a 
just and lasting peace for the benefit of the entire region is 
contingent upon immediately addressing this completely 
unacceptable situation and on finding a new way of cooperating 
with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan." 
  Attending the meeting with King Husayn were Prime Minister 
'Abd al-Salam al-Majali, Royal Court Chief al-Sharif Zayd Bin 
Shakir and the King's Political advisor Marwan al-Qasim. 
  The interceptions are part of a U.S.-led effort to enforce 
the international sanctions that were imposed on Iraq after its 
August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
  Jordan, which has suffered large losses because of the 
sanctions against Iraq, has repeatedly complained of the 
problems the enforcement of the sanctions poses and suggested 
that sea searches be replace by less disruptive land inspection 
at the Port of al- 'Aqabah. 
  Washington said it was studying the proposal, which involves 
a neutral international body such as Lloyds register inspecting 
the cargo. 
  Since early this year, the interceptions of ships headed for 
al-'Aqabah have gone up, causing costly delays to Jordanian 
importers. 
  But the U.S. Navy denied the allegation. "There has been no 
change in guidelines and no change in our procedures," 
Lieutenant-Commander Bruce Cole, spokesman for U.S. Naval Forces 
Central Command headquaters in the Gulf was quoted as saying by 
the Associated Press. 
  But official figures show seven ships have been turned back 
or delayed for periods of up to four days this year, compared to 
20 in all of 1993. 
  Three vessels in March were given extra searches before 
docking, including demands to see every package, complaints of 
unclear mainfests and even a protest of "stinging bees in the 
haches of ships" shipping agents quoted by Reuter said. 
  The Lower House of Parliament last week urged the government 
not to return to the U.S.-backed Arab-Israeli peace talks before 
the siege of al-'Aqabah is lifted.

  [Text] Khaldun Abu-Hassan, head of the Amman Chamber of 
Industry, has met with (Jeng Huang Wan), secretary of the UN 
Sanctions Committee. They reviewed the status of the industrial 
sector in Jordan as a result of the sanctions imposed on Iraq 
and the measures being taken in the Red Sea, which delay the 
arrival of imports and increase their costs, thus increasing the 
cost of Jordanian products and reducing their competitiveness. 
Details are in the following report: 
  Khaldun Abu-Hassan told the UN official that Jordan feels it 
is being targeted by these measures. He said that the cost of 
these measures increases the cost of shipping every tonne of 
goods by $15, which constitutes an additional cost to Jordan 
amounting to approximately $600 million per year. He noted that 
the measures have also resulted in damaging some of the goods 
that undergo inspection. He added that delays in the arrival of 
these goods has also forced exporters to pay fines to the 
parties who have ordered these good. 
  He said that preventing the import of certain raw materials 
from Iraq resulted in increasing the cost of local production, 
which is the case with importing sulfur that led to an increase 
in the cost of producing fertilizers in Jordan. 
  Abu-Hassan noted that Jordan was affected by the Gulf crisis 
on a larger scale by losing some of its traditional markets, not 
including Iraq, and the return of thousands of Jordanians 
working in the Gulf states. This, he added, has affected the 
Jordanian economy and increased poverty and unemployment. 
  The head of the Chamber of Industry said that the UN 
Sanctions Committee's resolution is not based on firm standards, 
noting that if it sometimes allows the export of a certain 
commodity to Iraq, it does not mean that it will allow the 
continuous export of this commodity. 
  For his part, Mr. (Jeng), secretary of the UN Sanctions 
Committee, reaffirmed that Jordan is not being targeted by the 
sanctions but is being affected by them. He noted that the 
Sanctions Committee is aware that Jordan is the second country 
after Iraq that is being harmed by the sanctions. He said that 
he would present a memorandum from the Chamber of Industry to 
the UN Sanctions Committee and will brief them on Jordan's 
situation. 
  The two sides discussed a proposal by the chamber to send a 
delegation representing the various sectors harmed by the 
sanctions to express their viewpoint to the Sanctions Committee 
and hold contacts with the Jordanian Government to discuss and 
arrange this visit. (Jeng) expressed willingness to follow up 
this proposal. 
  In another development, Muhammad 'Asfur, chairman of the 
Board of Directors of the Amman Chamber of Commerce, received a 
Canadian economic delegation, including a number of businessmen 
and representatives of Canadian companies. A number of 
Jordanian businessmen attended. 
  'Asfur reviewed Jordanian-Canadian economic relations, the 
economic situation in Jordan, the negative effects of the siege 
on the port of al-'Aqabah, the losses and the increase in the 
prices of commodities and products that have resulted from 
inspections and from other measures taken under the pretext of 
implementing UN resolutions. 
  The guest delegation expressed its understanding of Jordan's 
stands and economic situation and its willingness to increase 
and reinforce trade and economic exchange between the two 
friendly countries. The delegation also expressed a desire to 
exert efforts to lift the siege on the ships bound for the port 
of al-'Aqabah.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Let the Farce of al-'Aqabah Blockade Stop"] </F>
  [Text] After drawn-out patience and strong adherence to 
quiet diplomacy, His Majesty King Husayn placed the issue of 
al-'Aqabah blockade in its proper place when he summoned the 
ambassadors of the five permanent Security Council member states 
and informed them in very clear terms of the pressures and 
harassments Jordan is facing due to the blockade imposed on 
Jordan's only port. 
  It is obvious that this blockade, which has been continuing 
for several years, is not aimed only at inflicting losses on the 
national economy and increasing the difficulties arising from 
the Gulf war, but also undermining national dignity and 
inflicting political harm on a country that has always been an 
element of stability and moderation in the region. 
  Had the naval siege of the port of al-'Aqabah been the 
result 
of the Gulf war, not only Jordan-bound ships would have been 
searched to the exclusion of other countries in the region. No 
such arbitrary inspection is carried out in any of the ports of 
other states which have not attached great importance to the 
Iraq-related sanctions resolutions. 
  Moreover, inspecting more than 1,700 ships bound for 
al-'Aqabah during the last few years without detecting any 
violation of the blockade or its causes should have caused an 
end to such a naval farce if the blockade of al-'Aqabah was 
really linked to the issue of the embargo imposed on Iraq. 
  Accordingly, it has long been clear to us that those 
besieging the Port of al-'Aqabah are aiming at something else. 
They are trying to dictate to us policies and positions that 
neither agree with our national and pan-Arab considerations nor 
conform with our priorities and concepts of the developments of 
the current peace process in the Middle East. 
  Hence, the position His Majesty King Husayn expressed to the 
ambassadors of the permanent member states of the Security 
Council was starkly clear in projecting the fact that this 
blockade and these harassments undermine the historic role 
Jordan has always played in its capacity as a principal element 
of moderation in a region that suffered and continues to suffer 
from successive waves of extremism. 
  Given such a situation, Jordan, which counted much on quiet 
diplomacy to end the siege imposed on its only port, cannot and 
will not play its vital role in making peace before this totally 
unacceptable situation has been promptly addressed in a manner 
that respects the Jordanian will and refrains from doing 
anything that harms it.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Frank, Clear Stand in Meeting With Ambassadors"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, King Husayn was, as always, clear and 
frank in his meeting with the ambassadors of the five major 
powers. The king briefed them on the pressures and harassments 
to which Jordan has been subjected as a result of the al-'Aqabah 
port siege and the inspection operations of ships bound for the 
port, and the subsequent losses, the harm done to our national 
economy, and the suffering of our merchants and citizens. 
  Taking into consideration the fact that these measures and 
this treatment are confined to Jordan to the exclusion of other 
neighboring states and countries, we realize the extent of the 
contempt in which the major powers and the international 
organizations to which these powers are affiliated are holding 
Jordan. This is an encroachment on our country's sovereignty 
and a denial of its historic role and great responsibilities in 
establishing peace, stability, and progress in the region. 
  Therefore, the king emphasized the need to stop these 
practices and end this completely unacceptable situation and 
deal with Jordan in a new method, preserving its dignity and 
respecting its right and role. 
  In his meeting with the ambassadors, his majesty linked 
Jordan's resumption of its role in the process of just and 
durable peace to this abnormal situation and asserted that the 
resumption of Jordan's responsible role in peace-making is 
contingent on the cessation of these practices and on ceasing 
any acts that harm Jordan's sovereignty, harass and annoy ships 
bound for al-'Aqabah, or harm the trade sector and the Jordanian 
citizens. 
  We have tolerated enough harassment and siege and endured 
unjustifiable inspection operations of ships--an inspection 
which did not produce any violations related to the siege. The 
major powers, the UN Security Council, and the United Nations 
must realize that nations have sovereignty and that they should 
respect this sovereignty rather than become tools of injustice, 
oppression, and enslavement of peoples, and that they should 
abide by their own preaching of respect for people's freedom and 
human rights.

between the Palestinians and Israelis, which will resume in 
Cairo tomorrow. 
  In a statement to the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY, Hakam Bal'awi

  [Text] At a meeting between Prime Minister Dr. 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali and Hakam Bal'awi, representative of 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, who arrived in Amman last 
night, the latest developments on the Palestinian-Israeli track 
were reviewed. 
  Bal'awi conveyed the Palestinian leadership's ideas on the 
current stage of Palestinian-Israeli talks to the Jordanian 
Government, and the circumstances that surrounded the adoption 
of Security Council Resolution 904. 
  [Begin recording] [Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for 
cabinet affairs and information minister] His excellency the 
prime minister today received Hakam Bal'awi who, in my opinion, 
presented a positive stand that covered many issues. We 
explained to him our viewpoint, which I explained in detail 
earlier, regarding our position on the Jerusalem issue. I think 
that, henceforth, we need to coordinate our positions on 
Jerusalem because this subject, as you know, is an Arab, 
Palestinian, Jordanian, Islamic, and Christian subject. The 
responsibility toward this subject is very great. 
  [Bal'awi] I had the honor to meet with his excellency the 
prime minister this morning. I am here as the envoy of 
President 'Arafat and the Palestinian leadership to brief the 
Jordanian brothers on all details that preceded and followed the 
recent security council resolution, and on all Palestinian 
contacts with the Israelis and Americans on developments in the 
situation following the massacre in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in 
Hebron. Undoubtedly, the brothers in Jordan closely follow all 
these speedy and important details. We should work together in 
all fields. We are not neighbors, but one people in the same 
geographic area. We work together and our capabilities are 
devoted to attaining the Palestinian independence that will 
eventually enhance the Jordanian independence, which will then 
create the forthcoming Jordanian-Palestinian cohesion which, God 
willing, will be a living model for the future, civilized Arab 
situation in this area. [end recording]

  [Test] Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign 
affairs, said that the meetings of the Arab League Council, 
which ended in Cairo yesterday, tackled the issues of Arab 
solidarity and reconciliation within the issue of pan-Arab 
security. This came in statements to our political affairs 
correspondent Shakir Maharimah upon the minister's return from 
Cairo this evening. 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Hasan] Foremost of the many issues 
discussed by the Political Committee were the Arab-Israeli 
conflict, the issue of Jerusalem, and the intifadah. Jordan 
made a lengthy comment on this issue. We reviewed the peace 
process and the Jordanian stand that condemned the massacre 
perpetrated in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque as well as our stand on 
UN Security Council Resolution 904. We also reviewed His 
Majesty King Husayn's efforts toward this issue and the 
Jordanian measures aimed at expressing condemnation of the 
horrific massacre and at showing concern and pressuring the 
international community to take measures to protect the 
Palestinian people. 
  [Maharimah] Your excellency, What about your bilateral 
contacts during the current session of the Arab League Council? 
  [Al-Hasan] During my visit to Cairo, I held a series of 
bilateral contacts. I met with a number of brother Arab foreign 
ministers. I met with the foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria, 
Oman, and Yemen. I also met with the foreign minister of the 
Federal Islamic Republic of Comoros, the new 22d member in the 
Arab League Council. I also had the honor of meeting with 
Egyptian Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi. We discussed bilateral 
issues of interest to both countries as well as a number of 
Arab, regional, and international issues. [end recording]

  [Text] Amman, 27 Mar (MENA)--Jordanian Prime Minister Dr. 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has stated that the Joint 
Egyptian-Jordanian Higher Committee chaired by the prime 
ministers of the two countries will hold its next meeting in 
Amman during the first week of April. He said that postponement 
of the meeting, which was supposed to take place in the second 
half of March, was due to special circumstances concerning 
officials in Egypt. 
  In a statement to MENA, Dr. al-Majali called for Arab 
reconciliation, saying that Jordan sincerely extends its hand to 
Arab brothers for solidarity. He said: I think that this 
matter is very essential, especially as there is a system being 
worked out for the region, and we are afraid that it will be 
worked out without consulting us. This will not be to our 
advantage. Therefore, we must have Arab understanding and 
solidarity, and determine the system acceptable to us in the 
region. 
  Regarding the peace negotiations, the Jordanian prime 
minister pointed out that the resumption of the Arab-Israeli 
peace negotiations in Washington must take place following 
agreement by the Arab countries concerned. Jordan cannot adopt 
a separate decision in this regard. He said that this subject 
might be discussed on the sidelines of the meetings of the Arab 
League foreign ministers council currently being held in Cairo. 
He emphasized that no date has been set for a meeting of the 
Arab states concerned with the peace process. 
  Answering a question, Dr. al-Majali denied that any prior 
arrangements had been made for a Jordanian-Saudi summit meeting 
during King Husayn's visit to Saudi Arabia for the minor 
pilgrimage. He said that the Jordanian monarch's visit was only 
to perform this religious rite.

<F P=106> [By Mariam M. Shahin, JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] Amman--an Islamist/leftist coalition Monday [28 
March] marked the one-month anniversary of the Hebron massacre 
by calling on Arab and Muslim governments to pull out of peace 
negotiations with Israel. 
  "We, together with the Arab masses, must continue to exert 
pressure on the Arab regimes and the Palestine Liberation 
Organisation to give up the policy of surrender and stop their 
negotiations with the Zionist entity," read a joint statement 
issued by the two Jordanian political parties, the Islamic 
Action Front (IAF) and the National Action Front (NAF). 
  "Our conflict with the Zionist enemy is the struggle over 
existence not over borders," said the statement. 
  The coalition leaders, which include IAF Secretary General 
Ishaq al-Farhan and former leftist radicals Muhammad al-Zu'bi, 
Naji Allush and Breik Hadid, asked the "Arab nation to resist 
all attempts of normalisation with the Zionist enemy," during a 
joint press conference." 
  "We warn the Arab regimes and the Arab League of the dangers 
inherent in lifting the boycott of the Zionist entity," read 
their joint statement. To lift the boycott, said the group, 
would constitute the imposition of further "Zionist domination 
and occupation." 
  The coalition, also known as the United Front, said it held 
the media partially responsibly for supporting the peace process. 
  "We call on the free and honest press to shoulder its 
responsibilities in highlighting the plight of Palestine and to 
actively counter normalisation policies in all their forms as 
well as to expose the cheap writers promoting normalisation with 
the Zionist enemy," said the statement. 
  The IAF, recognised as Jordan's most powerful political 
party, and NAF a relatively new political party, announced that 
they were "coalition partners" in early March. Their declared 
aim is to "resist Zionist designs and new world order strategies 
to disrupt the Middle East region," according to IAF Secretary 
General Ishaq al-Farhan. 
  The NAF, which only received official political party 
licence 
in January, is composed mostly of hardline pan-Arab nationalist 
parties and groups, many of whom were outlawed in Jordan before 
democratic reforms were introduced in 1989. 
  The coalition between the two parties was formed after the 
February killing of worshippers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron 
and the subsequent attack on a Maronite church in Lebanon. 
  The two parties declared that they had an "historic 
responsibility" to work together to actively oppose the 
normalisation of Arab countries with Israel.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter P.V. Vivekanand] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Twenty-three people charged with plotting and 
carrying out attacks aimed at destabilising internal security 
will be put on trial in mid-April, official sources said Sunday 
[27 March]. 
  The sources said the case, which was supposed to have gone 
on 
trial before the military tribunal shortly after the 'Id al-Fitr 
holiday this month, was delayed because the questioning of some 
of the suspects was not completed. 
  "The interrogations are continuing, and the charge sheet is 
being drawn up," said one source. 
  According to the source, the 23 suspects, all of whom are in 
detention, would be tried as one group charged with "plotting 
and carrying out terrorist activities and illegal possession of 
explosives." 
  The suspects were filtered from more than 40 people 
questioned after the Jan. 26 and Feb. 1 explosions at Amman's 
Rivoli and al-Zarqa's Salwa movie theatres. Both theatres were 
showing pornographic movies and the blasts gave rise to 
suspicions that religious zealots were behind them. 
  The sources said some of the suspects belonged to the 
so-called Arab Afghan group--volunteers from Arab countries who 
fought alongside Afghans in the 1980-90 battle against the 
Soviet occupation of Afghanistan--while others were locally 
recruited by them. 
  Asked whether it was established who financed the sabotage 
in 
Jordan, the source declined direct comment, but said that "all 
the suspects were guided by a single group...which sought to 
create chaos and undermine the internal security of the country." 
  Interior Minister Salamah Hammad told Parliament in February 
that authorities had uncovered a plot to destabilise Jordan 
through a series of attacks on theatres, videocassette and 
liquor shops, nightclubs and security forces. 
  Yemeni government officials, who faced a spate of similar 
explosions in their country several months ago, have been quoted 
as saying that Usamah Bin-Ladin, a Saudi millionaire of Yemeni 
origin who supported the "Arab Afghans", was suspected to have 
financed those who carried out the attacks in Yemen. 
  Mr. Bin-Ladin, who has been disowned by his Saudi-based 
tribe 
and family, is believed to be living in Khartoum, Sudan. 
Reports in the Egyptian press have indicated him as a main 
supporter of extremist military groups waging a violent campaign 
to topple the government of President Husni Mubarak. 
  There was no immediate confirmation or denial of whether the 
Jordanian investigators suspected Mr. Bin-Ladin or any of his 
associates of involvement in the bombings in the Kingdom. 
  At least six of the suspects have confessed to have planted 
the explosive devices that went off at the Rivoli and Salwa 
theatres as well as others which were discovered at a 
supermarket outside Amman and the Zahran cinema, local reports 
said. 
  Arabic-language papers carried photographs of the suspects, 
all of whom appeared to be in their early 20s, accompanied by 
prosecutors and police officers, reenacting the planting of the 
bombs at these places after confessing during interrogations. 
  No background details were available on any of the suspects. 
  The sources said most of them are from lower middle class 
families and some of them would be charged as accessories before 
and after the crime. 
  It was not clear from the reports how many of the suspects 
knew each other. They were all said to have worked separately, 
as small groups, unaware of each other, under the guidance of 
one or more people. 
  According to the reports, one of the suspects, Muhammad 
'Adaribah, told interrogators that he tried and failed to plant 
a bomb at the Rivoli, in downtown Amman, one week before the 
Jan. 26 blast. 
  The device, described as a time-bomb that actually went off 
inside the theatre at midnoon, was planted by another suspect, 
Yasin Zahrah, the reports said. Seven people were injured in 
the blast. 
  The youth who planted the bomb which was discovered and 
defused at Amman's Zahran cinema was identified as Samir Ahmad, 
who told police that he was asked to plant the bomb by Muhammad 
Shihadah, a construction material salesman from the al-Baq'ah 
refugee camp. 
  Mr. Ahmad was reported to have met Mr. Shihadah, described 
as 
an Arab Afghan, in front of the al-Husayni Mosque in downtown 
Amman to inform him that he had planted the bomb inside the 
theatre. 
  Mr. Shihadah, who is also under detention, was also 
implicated in the al-Zarqa' bombing by the man who confessed to 
have planted the device, 'Id Jahalin, a 30-year-old plumber from 
al-Baq'ah. 
  Mr. Jahalin lost his limbs in the explosion when the bomb 
exploded prematurely. His confession from his hospital bed is 
believed to have been the most significant breakthrough in the 
case. 
  The suspects also took interrogators to 'Akrush Supermarket 
in Safut, which straddles the main road between Amman and 
al-Baq'ah camp, and reenacted the planting of the device which 
was discovered and defused there a few days before the Rivoli 
blast. 
  Mr. Zahrah, the man who reportedly confessed to the Rivoli 
explosion, was also identified as the one who planted the bomb 
at the supermarket. 
  Another target of the suspects was the sprawling Housing 
Bank 
complex in the heart of Amman, according to the reports. 
  Some of the suspects showed interrogators how "they cased 
the 
joint to determine where to plant the bombs" but no explosives 
were actually placed in the complex. 
  Apart from Mr. 'Adaribah, Mr. Zahrah, Mr. Ahmad, Mr. 
Shihadah 
and Mr. Jahalin, other suspects identified by name included 
Hasan Hamdan and Sulayman Biyah. 
  All the bombs were said to have used crude technology widely 
employed by the Afghan rebels in their battle against the Red 
Army and Soviet-supported government soldiers in Afghanistan. 
  The bombing case is the second known organised sabotage 
attributed to "Arab Afghans" in Jordan. 
  In 1991, members of a group called "Jaysh Muhammad 
(Muhammad's Army)" made up mostly of Afghan returnees were 
arrested following a series of attacks and foiled attempts 
against night-clubs, cinemas, liquor shops and security officers 
as well as government buildings and diplomatic missions. 
  Eighteen of them were tried and convicted; eight of them, 
two 
in absentia, were given the death sentence, and others were 
jailed for terms ranging from two years to 15 years. 
  His Majesty King Husayn later commuted the death sentences 
to 
life imprisonment for the six who appeared in court. 
  In a Feb. 15 meeting with the members of the Foreign 
Relations Committee of the Upper House of Parliament, the King 
referred to the late spate of sabotage actions and said a "small 
group" with foreign links was responsible for them. 
  "There are certain parties and circles trying to reach and 
influence our youth who are in vulnerable positions," the King 
said. 
  The influenced youth, he said, "are goaded into committing 
crimes," and "the parties and circles seek to reach the weak and 
strong points of our people--our religion and faith." 
  "We have warned against such attempts to distort our faith 
and our Islam, and we have often called for action to prevent 
matters from getting out of hand or beyond reason," the King 
said.

  [Text] A delegation representing the Council of Islamic 
Organizations and Societies and the Muslim World League's bureau 
in Amman met with the Austrian ambassador to Jordan and conveyed 
to him a memorandum protesting his government's decision to give 
this year's $30,000-award for European literature to Indian-born 
British writer Salman Rushdie, author of Satanic Verses. 
  The book slanders and lies about all prophets, especially 
Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and members of his family. 
  The delegation told the ambassador that giving the award to 
Rushdie is a deliberate hostile action and is considered a 
challenge to the feelings of Muslims. The delegation said this 
was what U.S. President Bill Clinton had done when he invited 
Salman Rushdie to go to the United States from Britain, received 
him at the White House, and encouraged him to continue his 
anti-Islam and Muslims march. 
  The delegation added that the Austrian Government had 
committed a serious action, one which influences its relations 
and friendship with the Arab and Islamic states. 
  At the end of the meeting, the ambassador promised to convey 
the memorandum to his government.

<F P=106> [By P.V. Vivekanand, JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] Amman--A German vessel was turned away early Monday 
[28 March] from the Gulf of Aqaba by the enforcers of the 
international sanctions against Iraq despite an agreement under 
which cargo aboard the ship was supposed to have been inspected 
at al-'Aqabah port, informed sources said. 
  They said the 13,000-tonne Skyman was denied entry after 
inspectors aboard the American-led warships patrolling the Red 
Sea insisted on their own interpretation of an agreement reached 
with Jordan, the sources said. 
  Under the accord, the first of its kind since the sanctions 
against Iraq went into force in August 1990, an inspector from 
one of the U.S. warships was to aboard the Skyman at the Tiran 
Straits in the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba and come to the port 
aboard the vessel to supervise the inspection of the cargo 
unloaded at the port, the sources said. 
  "But instead of sending an inspector aboard the vessel, the 
Americans insisted that the agreement was that a warship will 
accompany the Skyman to al-'Aqabah," said one of the sources. 
  "The Jordanian government rejected the suggestion and hence 
the ship was turned away," added the source, who, like others 
who confirmed the incident, spoke on condition of anonymity. 
  According to another source, "Jordan rejected the American 
suggestion since (the Kingdom) considered the entry of a ship 
escorted by a warship into Jordanian waters as an infringement 
of its sovereignty." 
  Furthermore, said the source, the American insistence on 
sending a frigate to accompany the Skyman despite Jordan's 
record of abiding by the sanctions against Iraq was also seen as 
raising questions on the Kingdom's credibility and sincerity. 
  His Majesty King Husayn has repeatedly said that Jordan 
would 
not allow anyone to question its credibility and sincerity. 
  When it was known two days ago that the cargo aboard the 
Skyman -- 3,000 tonnes of general cargo including steel rods and 
animal feed -- was to be inspected on land at al-'Aqabah port 
instead of the Tiran Straits, hopes were raised that it could be 
the forerunner of an arrangement to move all cargo inspections 
to port. 
  Under the proposed arrangement, a neutral international 
agency would inspect all incoming and outgoing cargo for 
violations of the sanctions against Iraq. 
  The Skyman was first turned away last Wednesday after four 
inspections since March 19 failed to satisfy the "cargo 
accessibility" demands of the inspectors. 
  Following the denial of entry, for the ship proceeded 
towards 
the Gulf Port of Dubai to unload cargo destined there before 
possibly returning to al-'Aqabah or offloading the Jordan-bound 
cargo elsewhere the shipowners or consigners--as the case may be 
subject to the terms and conditions of the bill of lading--to 
tranship the goods to al-'Aqabah. [sentence as published] 
  Contacts launched by the Jordanian government led to the 
agreement for an on-land inspection of the cargo and the Skyman 
was recalled to the Red Sea, only to be turned away again as 
happened on Monday. 
  The Skyman was the seventh ship to be intercepted and 
subjected to costly delays this year compared with 20 vessels 
during last year. 
  U.S. Navy spokesman deny that there is an escalation of 
interceptions and tightening of inspection procedures despite 
the high number of ships delayed or forced to offload cargo 
elsewhere. 
  Jordan has lodged numerous protests to the U.N. Security 
Council, which imposed and authorised the enforcement of the 
sanctions, and the U.S., which is leading the monitoring of the 
sanctions. The protests highlighted that the actual victim of 
the overzealous enforcement of the sanctions was Jordan and that 
the volume of Iraq-bound cargo passing through al-'Aqabah had 
declined to less than 20 per cent of the pre-Gulf crisis level. 
  Shipping agents say that Iraq-bound goods passing through 
Turkey and Iran are six times that coming to al-'Aqabah and 
point out that Turkish bound and Iran-bound vessels are not 
subjected to any inspections.

  [Text] A U.S. spokesman has said the United States is 
studying plans to ease the commercial embargo on the Port of 
al-'Aqabah. He said one proposal being considered is a plan to 
inspect ships once they have docked at al-'Aqabah, instead of 
the current procedure of stopping and searching them before they 
reach the Port of al-'Aqabah. 
  The U.S. State Department's Michael McCurry said the United 
States is examining proposals that are supposed to respond to 
the Jordanian Government's concerns.

  [Text] Military sources close to Yemeni Defense Minister 
Haytham Qasim have said in Aden that the north Yemenis have 
imported various types of chemical weapons and ammunition from 
East European states through a Jewish arms dealer known for his 
close ties with Zionist circles that are very active in these 
states. 
  Defense Ministry sources in Sanaa categorically denied this. 
They said such claims tarnish the image of Yemen and obstruct 
the implementation of the pledge and accord document signed in 
Amman to achieve Yemeni reconciliation. Defense Ministry 
sources in Sanaa said an officer called Colonel 'Ali al-Hadi, a 
member of the south Yemeni Socialist Party and armament director 
at the Defense Ministry, is currently in an East European state 
to make a deal to purchase long-range missiles against the will 
of the Defense Ministry in Sanaa. 
  In another development, Yemeni newspapers spoke about a 
recent clash between the northern and southern forces in the 
Shabwah area in southern Yemen, in which five were killed. A 
north Yemeni source, however, said it was a clash between tribes 
and only two were killed.

<F P=106> [Report by Faysal Makram and Iqbal 'Ali 'Abdallah: "Aden: </F>
Sanaa Importing Chemical Weapons"] 
  [Excerpt] Sanaa, Aden -- A statement issued by the Defense 
Ministry in Aden accuses "the economic military establishment in 
the capital, Sanaa, of importing various types of 
internationally banned chemical weapons and ammunition from a 
number of East European countries." 
  The statement, a copy of which AL-HAYAH received in Aden 
yesterday, says: "These weapons and ammunition are imported 
through a Jewish dealer who has strong links and ties with the 
Zionist centers of influence formed recently in a number of East 
European states." 
  The statement, which falls within the framework of the 
resumption of media campaigns between the southern forces 
supporting the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] and the northern 
forces supporting the General People's Congress, describes "the 
weapons brought to Yemen recently as weapons of mass destruction 
like those which have been and are still being destroyed in Iraq 
and which are banned in other states." 
  The statement says: "The military-economic establishment is 
a 
close commercial establishment controlled directly by the ruling 
military family in Sanaa. It controls most trade activities in 
the republic without the knowledge of the government and the 
House of Representatives." 
  The YSP, which controls Aden, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping 
[YRG], which is led by Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, 
speaker of the House of Representatives, traded accusations 
yesterdays. The YRG said that houses belonging to its supporters 
in Aden has been stormed, while security sources in the city 
said that large quantities of weapons had been confiscated in 
hideouts in the city. 
  The sources added that "the security services in Aden have 
over the past two days discovered large quantities of weapons 
which were smuggled in secretly and delivered to terrorist 
elements belonging to the Jihad organization in Yemen." The 
sources said that "interrogations of the suspects accused of 
acquiring the weapons have shown that they belong to a major 
Islamic party in the country" -- a clear reference to the YRG.

Shabwah in eastern Yemen in recent clashes with forces loyal to

<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Gulf Support for </F>
Egyptian-Syrian Mediation in Yemen"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- Political sources have revealed to 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Syria and Egypt intend to play an 
important part in resolving the Yemeni crisis. They said that 
the foreign ministers of Syria, Egypt, and Yemen, who are now in 
Cairo to attend the Arab League Council's meeting, will, after 
the Arab League meetings, hold talks to redefine the framework 
for future action. Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and Yemeni 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih held a closed meeting in Damascus 
last Thursday. They discussed Yemeni developments and ways of 
ending the disputes and restoring stability to the state of 
unity. It was not known what agreement was reached by the two 
presidents and there was no indication of their future plans. 
  Yemeni sources, however, have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that, 
during his visit to Damascus, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
tried to "break the ice" between him and Syria and to regain 
Syria's trust after the position he took during the Gulf war. 
His closed meeting with President al-Asad lasted one and a half 
hours. The talks were frank and in depth. 
  Yemeni opposition sources said that President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih realized the terrible mistake he made when supporting 
Saddam Husayn during the invasion and the Gulf war, and he has 
been trying to restore confidence and understanding with the 
states which supported Kuwait. They added that none of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] members attended the Syrian-Yemeni 
meetings despite the official announcement -- according to the 
list sent from Yemen -- that YSP Political Bureau Member and 
Fish Resources Minister Fadl Muhsin would be a member of the 
Yemeni delegation. The sources said that the Syrian move 
coincided with a similar Egyptian move on Yemen, with Gulf 
support based on confidence in these two states and the fact 
that neither has any ambitions in Yemen. President Hafiz al-Asad 
might invite President Salih, Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, 
and other leaders to Damascus for a dialogue to end the crisis. 
Al-Bid had himself expressed support for such a move. Syria 
and Egypt are expected to uphold the Pledge and Accord Document 
and act as a third-party witness to that. 
  Diplomatic sources believe that Syria and Egypt might, with 
Arab League approval, send military forces to Yemen in the event 
of a threat of a military explosion and partition there. They 
add that the Yemeni parties would be well advised to take this 
matter into consideration and show commitment to stability in 
Yemen. They sources also say that President al-Asad has so far 
been focusing on restoring trust between the Yemeni parties and 
finding common grounds for understanding among them on the way 
to ending the crisis.

  [Text] Baghdad, 30 Mar (INA) -- AL-THAWRAH newspaper 
describes the UN Security Council's instructions for Special 
Commission Chairman Rolf Ekeus to submit a monthly progress 
report as the right beginning for neutralizing intense pressure 
being applied by certain quarters to influence council 
resolutions. 
  In an article published today, the paper calls it a 
qualitative shift and positive step indicative of a growing 
sober, understanding, and fair approach uninfluenced by an 
antagonistic United States out to manipulate the commission's 
work and steer it away from its declared goals. 
  The progress the commission will report will be a virtual 
certificate that the international community is increasingly 
showing an understanding of Iraq's cooperation vis-a-vis 
Resolutions 686 and 715. 
  The paper applauds the constructive and fair stands of 
France, Russia, the PRC, and Brazil during the council's debate 
at which the the four countries departed from the U.S. position 
calling for dragging the sanctions out. 
  This positive development at the Security Council would not 
have been possible had it not been for Saddam Husayn's letter of 
facts, carried to the council by the Iraqi delegation. Credit 
must also go to Iraq's proven capacity for steadfastness and 
tenacity. 
  This appreciable change at the council clearly shows a 
conflict of interests between these states and Washington, which 
tries to commandeer and monopolize decision making for its own 
ends. It is also the result of Iraq standing up for its 
legitimate rights and its valiant resistance to all pressure and 
blackmail, AL-THAWRAH concludes.

  [Text] Baghdad, 29 Mar (INA)--Commenting on the statement 
issued by the UN Special Commission yesterday on what it 
described as an attack with stones by a group of people on a 
helicopter belonging to the Commission at Saddam Hospital in 
Mosul, northern Iraq, an official spokesman for the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs has stated the following: 
  1. Three helicopters belonging to the UN Special Commission 
have been operating in Iraq since late 1991. These helicopters 
carry out the tasks assigned by the UN Special Commission in 
accordance with Resolutions 687 and 715. 
  2. In emergency cases, the UN Special Commission requests 
that Iraq agree to the use of these helicopters in medical 
evacuation operations for other UN organizations. For 
humanitarian reasons, Iraq has agreed on such sorties, despite 
the fact that the missions of these helicopters have nothing to 
do with medical evacuations for organizations other than the UN 
Special Commission. 
  3. On 26 March, the Special Commission requested that Iraq 
give permission for one of the helicopters to carry out medical 
evacuation from Mosul to Baghdad for two UN guards at Saddam 
General Hospital. Iraq agreed to the request for humanitarian 
reasons, and the helicopter's route was defined from the 
al-Rashid Air Base in Baghdad to the Ibn-Firnas Air Base in 
Mosul. 
  4. On 27 March, a helicopter belonging to the Special 
Commission, accompanied by an Iraqi helicopter, left Baghdad for 
Mosul. A few minutes before arriving at the Ibn-Firnas Air Base 
in Mosul, UN elements accompanying the two UN guards at Saddam 
Hospital in Mosul contacted the Special Commission's helicopter 
and requested that it land at Saddam Hospital because the 
ambulance at this hospital was not fit for transferring the 
wounded to the Ibn-Firnas Air Base. 
  5. When the helicopter approached the base, the pilot of 
the UN Special Commission's helicopter requested that Iraq 
change the landing area and to make it the Saddam Hospital in 
Mosul. Despite the fact that the Iraqi side knew that this 
request would be difficult to meet due to the existence of 
technical and administrative obstacles that require advance 
preparation, it responded to the request for humanitarian 
reasons and based on the Special Commission's pledge that the 
landing at the hospital would be on their own responsibility. 
  6. When the Special Commission's helicopter landed suddenly 
in the Saddam Hospital area, which is a residential area, some 
of the citizens, visitors of the Saddam Hospital, assembled and 
expressed spontaneous anger by throwing stones at the 
helicopter. These feelings are not at all strange to Iraqis 
these days. 
  7. The accompanying Iraqi side did all that it could to 
protect the Special Commission's helicopter and its crew, and 
through their efforts, they were able to control the situation. 
Three accompanying Iraqis and a UN employee were slightly 
wounded as a result of the stone hurled at them. Among those 
who were wounded was the accompanying Iraqi pilot. The Special 
Commission's helicopter also sustained slight damage as a result 
of stones hitting it. Afterwards, the helicopter accomplished 
its mission and transported the two injured UN guards to Baghdad 
peacefully. 
  8. The abovementioned facts show that the incident, which 
was limited and spontaneous, was the result of the Special 
Commission's miscalculation by changing the landing area from 
the air base to a residential area in the center of Mosul. All 
this took place only a few minutes before the scheduled landing 
at the air base. From a technical and security viewpoint, this 
made it difficult, in fact impossible, for the Iraqi side to 
secure a new landing site due to the shortness of time, and in 
light of the fact that the Special Commission's pilots changed 
the landing area at their own responsibility. Facts also prove 
that Iraq exerted every effort to control the situation. This 
fact was recognized and appreciated by the German crew of the 
helicopter.

  [Text] Dr. Sa'dun Hammadi, adviser at the Presidency, has 
said that excessive oil production by certain Arab states has 
led to the deterioration of oil prices and greatly harmed 
national and pan-Arab economies. 
  At a symposium yesterday, organized by the Iraqi Economists 
Association and attended by Planning Minister Samal Majid Faraj, 
Dr. Hammadi said that this intentional excessive production by 
some Arab regimes such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United 
Arab Emirates [UAE] has caused a glut in world oil markets, 
causing a deterioration of the Arab oil price, which has dropped 
to $7 per barrel after it had been $34 per barrel. 
  Dr. Hammadi added: The Arab economy in general is 
essentially 
based on one commodity -- oil -- as a main source of revenue for 
economic development. This deterioration in the price of oil 
has caused large balance of payment deficits in several Arab 
states, affected development plans, and compelled the Arabs to 
seek foreign aid under terms that have affected their economic 
and political independence. 
  Dr. Hammadi wondered about the reason behind this situation, 
which has burdened the Arab states with financial losses 
amounting to $1 trillion between 1987 and 1992. He said the 
reason was that these regimes have thrown themselves into the 
lap of U.S. policy.

  [Editorial report] Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic on 20 and 
21 March 1994 publish a number of articles by Iraqi columnists 
commenting on the "split" within the UN Security Council during 
its latest periodic review of the blockade on Iraq. The 
columnists are unanimous that the split indicates an erosion of 
U.S. influence in the Council and growing sympathy with Iraq. 
  Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic 19 March carries on page one a 
500-word article by Taha al-Basri entitled: "The Blockade Is 
Bound To Be Eroded." Al-Basri writes that the heated debate 
within the UN Security Council over the statement it normally 
releases after every review of the blockade "is tangible proof 
that the unusual Iraqi steadfastness and the wise leadership of 
struggler President Saddam Husayn have borne fruit and that the 
blockade will sooner or later be eroded." The article adds that 
after more than three years of U.S. absolute domination of the 
Council "differences have emerged for the first time, splitting 
the members into two groups." The article continues: "Events 
of the past three days have clearly shown that a large majority 
of the members are now convinced that Iraq has the right to 
demand the lifting of the blockade after it has fulfilled its 
obligations under the Council resolutions." The article 
concludes: "By doing so, the member states are defending: 
first, the interests of their own countries; and second, the 
clear right that Iraqi diplomacy has been trying to explain to 
them all along." 
  The paper also publishes in its "Standpoint" column on page 
two an 800-word article by 'Isa Isma'il al-'Abbadi entitled: "UN 
Majority is With Iraq." Referring to the split within the 
Security Council, the article says: "Most big powers, 
especially France, China, and Russia, and the overwhelming 
majority of the world states have realized that the United 
States and Britain are playing a dirty political game that has 
nothing to do with UN resolutions and regulations, but has a 
great deal to do with their narrow-minded interests and their 
calculations to harm the Iraqi people and the other world 
nations, which have been affected by the unjust blockade that 
has been imposed on Iraq for more than three years." The 
article adds: "The U.S. and British Administrations must 
understand that the world around them is changing and that Iraq 
has rights and is an influential factor in the region and the 
world." Concluding, the article says that the world, which is 
speeding toward the 21st century, aspires for "balanced 
relations based on common interests, common concern for human 
progress, and justice." 
  The paper further publishes in its "Attention" column on 
page 
tree a 500-word article by Hasan al-Kashif entitled: "After the 
Non-Resolution." This item too refers to the split within the 
Security Council and the failure of the member states to come 
out with the usual periodic statement. It notes that this 
"non-resolution on the blockade has come as a big resolution to 
end the United States' new world order," thanks to Iraq's 
steadfastness and sacrifices under its great historic leader 
Saddam Husayn. It has also proven, the article adds, that 
"Washington is not suitable for the role of arbiter, because it 
has not discarded the garb of pirate and colonialist and is 
still influenced by the tendencies of domination, plunder, and 
even invasion and occupation." The article says that by 
supporting the "clear, firm facts" the UN Security Council 
members "have regained their role, position, and the respect of 
world nations and governments, which believe in peace, 
stability, justice, and fairness. "As for the Arabs," the 
article concludes "they are put before a test for the umpteenth 
time. They should either act as Arabs or remain mere followers 
of U.S. policy and thus fall behind the honest stands by 
governments of even non-Arab states. This is what we do not 
wish for any honest Arab." 
  The paper also publishes in its "Windows" column on page 
seven a 150-word article by Diya' Hasan entitled "The Split Has 
Occurred and the Rest Will Follow." The columnist notes that 
the important thing is that a split has occurred in the UN 
Security Council and that the majority has not given an easy 
"yes" this time. The article adds that despite the decision to 
continue the blockade for two more months, this time the 
decision did not come "by a mere hand signal from America's 
Madeleine Albright," but following a grueling debate lasting 
more than two days. The article adds: "The good thing about 
what happened was the anxiety expressed by some Security Council 
member states over Tariq 'Aziz's message to the Council, because 
it vehemently asserted Iraqi rights and pointed to the duties 
and obligations of the Council, which the Americans and British 
considered rather excessive under the prevailing logic in the 
world organization; that is, the logic of superiority and 
hegemony. But the message was intended to break the back of 
that useless logic." The article concludes that the Iraqi 
message succeeded in creating the split, which will be further 
widened if the member states also act according to their own 
national interests. 
  Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic 21 March 1994 publishes in its 
"Standpoint" column on page two an 800-word article by Sabri 
Hammadi entitled: "What Does This Split Mean?" Hammadi says the 
split in the Security Council must have disturbed and 
embarrassed the U.S. Administration, proving that the Council is 
no longer "a mere section of the U.S. State Department devoted 
to serving the aims and interests of the United States and its 
pampered protege, Israel. Here are three permanent member states 
in the Council saying no to U.S. hegemony and defending their 
interests and prestige as big powers." The article adds: "Of 
course, we do not want to exaggerate by considering the split 
that occurred as the desired change in the Security Council that 
will put an end to U.S. tyranny and monopolization. What took 
place was, however, the beginning of a new phase in the 
relationship between the permanent member states." The article 
concludes: "True, despite its significance, the clear split 
within the Security Council did not achieve the objectives 
aspired by Iraq, but it must also be said that what happened was 
a serious and promising start for a more just and fair 
international stand responding to Iraq's rights and legitimate 
demands."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Baghdad AL-QADISIYAH in Arabic carries 
in its 10 March issue on page 3 an approximately 4,000-word 
article by Sami Mahdi under the headline "The Middle East Market 
Between Solid Facts and Flimsy Justifications" in which the 
writer explains why Israel has an interest in establishing a 
Middle East market, how the Arabs would lose from such an 
economic entity, and why the Egyptian regime promotes it through 
its press and officials. 
  Speaking about Egypt's role, the writer says: "It has become 
clear that the Egyptian regime is the one which champions such a 
call among the Arabs for opportunistic and selfish reasons" and 
because the Egyptian regime "seeks a role for Egypt other than 
the natural one it assumes within its Arab environment and 
because it wants to take quick steps toward normalization with 
the Zionist enemy after it used to be afraid or to hesitate in 
taking such steps." 
  Continuing to speak about Egypt's role in this respect, the 
article says: "It would be politically naive to deal with a 
historic enemy of the Arab nation which has established its 
parasitic entity by usurping its lands, plundering its rights, 
and flouting its dignity." The article wonders about the blind 
Egyptian confidence in an enemy "which has not given up, as yet, 
its designs to swallow more Arab land and targets Arab resources 
such as water and oil?" 
  Explaining why such a market is impossible to establish, the 
writer says: "The enmity between the Arabs and the Zionists is 
not a transient one, originating from temporary differences 
between two countries and which can be settled during 
negotiations and later forgotten. It is a historical enmity 
between a usurper which not only does not want to give up what 
it had usurped but seeks to usurp more, and the victim which is 
asked to give up its rights by force under the canopy of unequal 
circumtances." 
  The article says that under the plan for a Middle East 
Market, Israel would gain everything such as new markets, the 
possibility to exploit oil sources, and many investment 
opportunities while "the Arab nation is asked to give up its 
unity, sacrifice its cultural identity, forget its usurped 
rights, and submit to a fait accompli." The article contnues: 
"It would be better for those who champion the establishment of 
economic blocs and those who search for benefits to be gleaned 
from such blocs to join their voices, if they are sincere, to 
those advocating Arab economic unity, or at least to those who 
call for an Arab common market that will fulfill the aspired 
objectives." The writer further says: "The establishment of an 
economic unity, or common market among countries which belong to 
the same nation is the most logical, scientific, objective, and 
concrete action which is in harmony with historical and 
geogrqaphic considerations and with the masses' present and 
future aspirations." The writer adds: "As for the Middle East 
market, it will be a market of material gains in which the Arab 
nation's enemies, the usurpers of its land and those who covet 
its resources will have their say and the lion's share." 
  Concluding, the writer says "The Middle East market is 
needed 
for specific reasons that serve the Zionist entity alone, 
legalize its usurpation, provides it with stability and 
security, solve its economic bottlenecks, realize the Zionist 
scheme, and enable it to systematically plunder Arab resources." 
The article ends by asking "what forces Arabs to give up their 
pan-Arab project and rush down the road to a Middle East market?"

<F P=106> [Report by Qusayy Salih al-Darwish: "As Zeroual Continues </F>
His Dialogues With Algerian Parties, a Call Within the Regime 
for the Formation of Armed Militias"] 
  [Excerpt] Paris -- Algeria has for the past 10 days been 
witnessing a race in the top echelon of the Algerian regime 
between advocates of political dialogue as a solution to 
Algeria's crisis and advocates of intransigence who want both 
the armed and unarmed wings of the fundamentalist trend to be 
cut out of Algeria's political life. 
  As President Lamine Zeroual continues his dialogue contacts 
with the political parties -- yesterday he met with 
representatives of the National Liberation Front [FLN] and Hamas 
[Islamic Society Movement] -- the prime minister, the interior 
minister, and the secretary general of the Trade Unions 
Federation continue their campaign against dialogue and have 
proposed new ideas about formation of militias and distribution 
of arms to the public, that is to supporters of the regime, to 
break the intensity of the dual confrontation between the Army 
and the armed organizations and turn that into a multiple 
confrontation in which civilian sectors of the population would 
take part. 
  In a statement it issued yesterday after meeting with 
President Zeroual, Hamas said that the Algerian president 
confirmed that the political dialogue which he started about a 
week ago will include leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front 
[FIS]. It added that President Zeroual reaffirmed his 
determination to hold a serious dialogue without excluding any 
party and without any pressures, and that he also emphasized 
that the Army will respect any decisions made by the political 
authority to ensure success of the dialogue. 
  That implies a denial of last week's reprts about 
differences 
between President Zeroual and some Army commanders. 
  Despite that denial, informed sources have stressed that 
such 
differences did occur during the military command's three-day 
meeting 10 days ago. 
  However, there are those who say that both sides in the end 
agreed on a compromise solution based on combining what may be 
achieved through security confrontation and what may be achieved 
through serious dialogue with all parties, and agreed that if 
the recent security campaign achieves tangible results, it will 
enable the regime to negotiate from a position of strength and 
will restore the state's lost prestige. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] In Algeria, the security forces have once again 
struck a severe blow against the Armed Islamic Group, the GIA. 
A few days ago, three close associates of the leader of this 
terrorist movement were killed near Medea, some 100 km south of 
Algiers. Jerome Bastion reports: 
  [Bastion] [passage omitted] We learned today that three 
close associates of the leader of the GIA were killed by 
security forces in bushland about 100 km to the south of 
Algiers, in a region where a secret congress of clandestine 
Islamic groups was taking place. The congress is said to have 
discussed the unification of the armed resistance under the 
banner of the GIA. It was after this meeting that Djamel 
Zitouni, one of these warlords, was killed, and it seems that it 
was in retaliation for this blow that the two French nationals 
were executed on Tuesday evening.

  [Excerpt] After an expulsion order by French police, which 
was endorsed today by a French court, of Algerian nationals 
Mouloud Medaci and Abdelkrim Youbi on charges of participating 
in a demonstration in Lyon, the Algerian Embassy in Paris today 
issued a statement received by APS. 
  The statement says that Algeria, its representation, and 
consulates are today, more than at any other time, keen to hear 
the concerns of the Algerian expatriate community. 
  The embassy views the expulsion order by absolute necessity 
to be a measure which will lead to confusion in peoples' minds. 
  In the same statement, our embassy in Paris renews Algeria's 
commitment to protect its subjects. It believes it is necessary 
to recall ties of cooperation and interests between it and those 
countries close to it. 
  The statement says that any attempt which is likely to lead 
to the belief that the dignity of citizens could be the subject 
of a misunderstanding is simply unacceptable. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Following a series of investigations, the security 
services reveal the identity of a number of the executors of the 
Saoula operation, which targeted a Russian national. 
  Through the investigations opened by the security services 
on 
the assassination of a Russian national yesterday in Saoula, 
south of the capital, it became clear that the Russian national 
used to frequent a spare-parts merchant and an ironmonger in the 
area. 
  The same sources pointed out that the victim had made an 
application to the two merchants to buy certain products 10 days 
earlier and arrived at the specified time in the same car he was 
using to receive the merchandise. This gave his assassins a 
chance to seize him, then assassinate him. 
  The same sources said that the security services, which 
immediately surrounded the place after they were informed of the 
operation, succeeded in killing and identifying four of the six 
armed members. The matter concerns Seddou Said, Chalmouh Ahmed, 
and Boutiche Yazid, who lived in Ouled Fayek and Douira [only 
three names as received]. 
  The two armed persons sought out by the security services 
are 
Kisoume Omar and Zitouni Djamal. 
  The security sources reported that the search is still under 
way for Sayeh Atia, the main executor of the assassination of 
the governor of Tissemsilt and members of the accompanying 
delegation on 11 January last.

  [Text] Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif has affirmed 
that President Husni Mubarak is trying to achieve inter-Arab 
reconciliation to overcome the repercussions of the Gulf war and 
find a new formula to end Arab differences and face the 
challenges of the Arab nation under the new economic and 
international order, in particular the GATT agreement and 
increased acts of violence and terrorism, within the framework 
of the new concept of pan-Arab security. 
  In statements made exclusively to AL-AHRAM AL-MASA'I, the 
information minister said that pan-Arab security requires a 
decisive stance to review the current formula, which no longer 
consists of military security, stockpiling of weapons and 
arsenals, or mobilization of troops. He said that the new 
formula is centered on economic, political, military, security, 
media, and educational areas. 
  Safwat al-Sharif noted that the GATT agreement, acts of 
violence and terrorism, and cultural confrontation targeting the 
identity of the Arab nation are the main reasons why a new 
concept of pan-Arab security is necessary. 
  Responding to a question on the Egyptian role in the new 
formula, the information minister affirmed that President Husni 
Mubarak's meetings with King Husayn of Jordan and Yemeni 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih focused on how to overcome Arab 
differences and find a way to implement the new pan-Arab 
security plan. 
  The information minister said that Egypt, led by Mubarak, is 
the nerve of pan-Arab security and the force behind the Arab 
nation in the areas of education, manpower, economy, and 
military. Al-Sharif described the current formula of pan-Arab 
security as a fragile one based only on the bonds of language 
and history. He warned about the challenges and dangers of the 
future awaiting the Arab nation. 
  On the acts of violence in the Arab region and the export of 
terrorism by Arab countries, the information minister said that 
terrorism is also present in those countries that are currently 
exporting it. He demanded inter-Arab cooperation to confront 
terrorism by using all possible means to bolster security in the 
Arab region. 
  Regarding the pan-Arab security project recently proposed by 
the Arab League, the information minister said that this 
project, with some amendments and modernization, increases the 
Arab nation's ability to confront future challenges. He 
affirmed that current developments make it essential that Arabs 
overcome their differences and erase the effects of the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait.

  [Text] The Arab countries can no longer escape 
reconsidering their position on Iraq on a purely realistic, 
practical, and pragmatic basis free from emotion. The Arab 
countries should reconsider their stance on Iraq based on 
accurate, logical, rational, and long-term calculations to serve 
the Arab nation's interests, and even the interests of the 
neighboring countries that have been subjected to aggression 
from the current Iraqi regime. 
  After more than three years since the Gulf War, which led to 
the collapse of the old Arab system without bringing down the 
Iraqi regime, and in view of the failure of all efforts to 
establish a new system capable of assimilating Arab and 
international changes, it is necessary for the Arab world to 
look for other ways to bring the Iraqi regime back into the 
fold. The Arab world should not leave Iraq in its isolation at 
the mercy of the international forces, primarily the United 
States and Britain, which seek to use the current situation for 
their own interests. 
  What happened at the UN Security Council recently indicates 
that the international alliance, which was opposed to Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait and also encouraged Saddam Husayn and 
provided him with weapons and nuclear capability that made him 
the bully of the Gulf, has been beset by clear rifts. These 
rifts appeared in the differences among the Security Council 
members over the statement that it releases periodically on the 
extent of Iraq's compliance with Resolution 715 on subjecting 
its military resources to international supervision, which is a 
condition for lifting international sanctions. 
  France, Russia, and the PRC believe that there is a need to 
note in the statement the "progress" Iraq made in destroying 
banned arms instead of issuing the usual arbitrary statement on 
which the United States and Britain insist, a statement that 
maintains that Iraq has not complied with all the necessary 
conditions to lift the sanctions. By insisting on this usual 
statement the United States and Britain seek to achieve goals to 
entrench the current division of the Arab world, a division that 
will only increase Iranian influence and deepen suspicions and 
fragmentation within the Gulf Cooperation Council itself. 
  The United States usually uses the stick and carrot in its 
dealings, even with North Korea, but it only uses the stick with 
Iraq. France and Russia believe that "encouraging" Iraq by 
giving it time to watch its behavior and note its progress will 
motivate it to cooperate in all areas, notably recognition of 
the state of Kuwait. 
  It is strange indeed that when foreign countries are seeking 
to "normalize" ties with Iraq, the Arab countries, which are 
racing to normalize ties with Israel, find no justification to 
even consider reaching a minimum level of normalization with 
Iraq.

<F P=106> [Article by Mustafa Mashhur, Muslim Brotherhood deputy </F>
leader: "The People's Will Conquers, O Clinton"] 
  [Text] We thought the United States had learned a lesson 
in Vietnam, but then it got involved again in Somalia. Now it 
is facing a more bitter experience by adopting an explicit 
position in favor of the Zionist enemy and extending strong 
support to it. Clinton has repeated the Zionist enemy's 
statement that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Zionist 
entity. The United States has also postponed the adoption of a 
resolution at the UN Security Council condemning the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre in Hebron, although more than three weeks have 
elapsed since the carnage. At the same time, the United States 
has prevented the UN Security Council from adopting a resolution 
lifting the sanctions against Iraq in order to sell its oil. 
Thus we see that the United States is adopting a double 
standard. 
  This policy is unacceptable. The United States will only win 
the anger of all the Islamic peoples with this policy. 
  Has Clinton forgotten that there is a UN Security Council 
Resolution No. 252 from 1968, which confirmed the legal status 
of Jerusalem and stated that any measures aimed at changing the 
status of Jerusalem are invalid? This resolution called on the 
Zionist enemy to immediately refrain from any action that could 
lead to a change in the status of Jerusalem. 
  Do we understand from this that the United States has the 
authority to impose resolutions and cancel resolutions of the 
Security Council whenever it wishes? 
  We would like to ask Clinton: Would he accept it if some 
Jews or people from any other nationality were to occupy any 
U.S. state and do to its American citizens what the Zionists are 
doing to the Palestinians and establish settlements against the 
will of its people? Or would the situation be different? 
  Let Clinton know that people are brought into this world 
free 
and will not accept being treated like slaves. Every person is 
proud of his freedom. Freedom will triumph, and blood will be 
shed freely for the sake of freedom. The will of the peoples 
will conquer, and injustice will have a terrible end. 
  The United States had paved the way for the cancellation of 
the United Nations resolution equating Zionism with racism. Is 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque incident considered racism or democracy? 
Are these blood-smeared hands considered the source of 
terrorism, violence, and extremism? This U.S. policy is 
rejected by all the Islamic peoples. It implements the wishes 
of the Knesset which is seeking to establish a state from the 
Nile to the Euphrates. 
  We said before that this enemy is full of hatred toward the 
Muslims. The Koran acknowledged this when it said: "Strongest 
among men in enmity to the believers wilt thou find the Jews and 
pagans." But there are people, may God forgive them, who have 
sought to establish reconciliation and peace with them. The 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque incident revealed some of the hatred and 
rancor the Jews have in their hearts. They even regarded the 
settler who killed this large number of Muslims as their patron, 
because the killing of Muslims is considered a cult. One of the 
rabbis even said with complete insolence that a finger of a Jew 
is worth one million Muslims. This is despicable and rejected. 
The Muslim's blood is precious. Glory is to God, his 
messenger, and the faithful. 
  Perhaps those who have been deceived by peace and 
negotiations with this enemy have awakened from their 
heedlessness and have realized that it is impossible to achieve 
peace with it. The responsibility for the massacre was not 
limited to this settler. Others participated in it, and some 
soldiers also colluded with him. The responsibility is 
collective, involving even the head of the state. Otherwise, 
how can we explain the instructions to the soldiers to kill the 
Palestinian stone thrower and not to kill the Zionist settler 
who kills with bullets? 
  They are the killers of the prophets. Who knows, perhaps 
they are planning to accomplish something momentous with the 
advent of the year 1997, the 100-year anniversary of the Basel 
conference in Switzerland in 1897. After the massacre, they 
also provoked the Palestinians, killing and wounding scores of 
them. Furthermore, a curfew was imposed on Hebron from the day 
of the incident. 
  We then saw that all that Rabin and Clinton are concerned 
about is for the negotiations and the peace process not to be 
halted because of the massacre. 
  These negotiations do not represent the Palestinian people. 
The Palestinian issue is not the issue of some Palestinians or 
some Arab rulers, but it is the issue of all the Muslims. We 
know that the United States resorts to the carrot and stick 
policy with some of these rulers and the few Palestinians 
represented by the PLO. 
  Let the United States and the Zionist enemy know that rulers 
change, but the peoples stay, and that the peoples' will 
conquers. Let them review their position on the Palestinian 
issue and the issues of Jerusalem and the al-Aqsa Mosque, the 
third holiest shrine. The Muslim peoples will not forsake the 
issue of Palestine and the al-Aqsa Mosque, irrespective of time 
and sacrifices. 
  To the Palestinians: We say to the Palestinians: Do not 
allow the Zionists to kill you from behind, but face them and 
defend yourselves and your land. This is a legitimate right. 
Know that your dead are in paradise and their dead are in hell. 
"So lose not heart, nor fall into despair, for ye must gain 
mastery if ye are true in faith. If a wound hath touched you, 
be sure a similar wound has touched the others. Such days (of 
varying fortunes) we give to men and men by turn that God may 
know those that believe, and that He may take to Himself from 
your ranks Martyr-witnesses (to truth). And God loveth not those 
that do wrong. God's object also is to purge those that are 
true in faith and to deprive of blessing those that resist 
faith." And slacken not if following up the enemy. If ye are 
suffering hardships, they are suffering similar hardships; but 
ye have hope from God, while they have none." [Koranic verses] 
  To the Muslims in general: O Muslims, Islam is not a 
personal 
religion. It is the religion of one nation, one group, and even 
one body. If one member of this body complains, the entire body 
comes to help. O Muslims, appreciate the meaning of the one 
nation and one body. Do not slacken, weaken, or keep quiet. You 
must rise up from your sleep. The matter is very serious. The 
enemies of Islam have underestimated you and undervalued your 
lives as we have seen in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kashmir, and other 
places. They were disgraced as they left hundreds of thousands 
of men, women, and children to be killed and tens of thousands 
of women to be raped and killed. 
  O Muslims, do not believe in the international institutions. 
They have become puppets in the hands of the arrogant forces. 
Call on your rulers to play a strong role in these 
institutions. Otherwise, establish an Islamic league that cares 
for and manages the affairs of the Muslims, protect and defend 
them. 
  The enemies of Islam are after their own interests. The 
Muslims in the world can use the weapon of popular boycott of 
enemy goods. It is an effective weapon against them. We warn 
against the issues of the Middle Eastern market, normalization 
with the enemy, and ending the boycott of Israel. These are 
extremely important matters, because they work for the benefit 
of the enemy. The economic issue will be followed by political 
hegemony. 
  It is not becoming of 1.2 billion Muslims to surrender to 
slaughter, displacement, and rape. We must act, contemplate, 
and think about what must be done to fortify ourselves before 
what happened in Palestine and Bosnia-Herzegovina is repeated 
against us. The first thing we must do is return to God and fear 
Him, and then equip ourselves with all the means of strength. 
The first of these is strength of faith, then the strength of 
unity, the strength of weapons and education, and so forth. We 
must then have confidence that Almighty God will support us and 
make us triumph. God's book tells us about victory, God 
willing: "Until there is no more tumult or oppression, and 
there prevail justice and faith in God." "Fain would they 
extinguish God's light with their mouths, but God will not allow 
but that His light should be perfected, even though the 
unbelievers may detest (it). It is he who hath sent His apostle 
with Guidance and the religion of truth to proclaim it over all 
religion, even though the pagans may detest (it)." [Koranic 
verses] 
  God has granted victory to his messenger and the few 
believers with him against the pagans in the Arabian Peninsula 
and against the Jews, Persians, and Greeks. If we follow the 
same path of God's messenger, may God's prayers and peace be 
upon him, God will grant us victory. 
  To the rulers of the Muslim countries: O rulers of the 
Muslim countries: Sense your responsibility for your Muslim 
peoples and cooperate with them. "Let not the strutting about 
of the unbelievers through the land deceive three: Little is it 
for enjoyment. Their ultimate abode is hell. What an evil bed 
(to lie on)." Purge your countries from what is objectionable 
and sinful that angers God. Educate your peoples about 
strength, fortitude, good character, and zeal for religion and 
your peoples will support you in the face of the enemy's 
treachery and even sacrifice their lives for you. 
  O rulers, all sedition fanned by the enemies between the 
Muslim countries and among the Muslims in the same country or 
between them and their rulers must be stopped. 
  Close your ranks according to God's book and his messenger's 
teachings and mend your differences. Respond to your Lord's 
order: "The believers are but a single brotherhood. So make 
peace and reconciliation between your two (contending) brothers; 
and fear God, that ye may receive mercy." "And hold fast, all 
together, by the rope which God stretches out for you, and be 
not divided among yourselves. And remember with gratitude God's 
favor on you, for ye were enemies and He joined your hearts in 
love, so that by His grace ye became brethren." [Koranic verses] 
  This is the way, and there is no other one. Avoid violence 
and counter violence. Avoid anything that could weaken our 
Islamic countries. 
  God be my witness, I have conveyed the message.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Rahim 'Ali] </F>
  [Text] A dispute has flared up between Asyut Governor Samih 
al-Sa'id and the People's Assembly members; each side is 
accusing the other of supporting terrorism. Escalating disputes 
have led Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi to call an emergency 
meeting next week to be attended by members of the Consultative 
Council and municipal councils in the governorate. 
  The governor held an emergency meeting in the governorate 
last week. It was attended by popular leaders. During the 
meeting, the governor criticized some People's Assembly and 
Consultative Council members sharply and accused them of 
assisting terrorists and protecting them instead of doing their 
duty to support the popular resistance of terrorism, at a time 
when the security agencies are doing their utmost to catch 
terrorists and contain their activity. 
  Muhammad 'Abd-al-Muhsin Salih, secretary of the National 
Democratic Party [NDP] in Asyut, expressed his belief that the 
Interior Ministry is engineering a conspiracy to embarrass 
Asyut's popular leaders. Muhammad Ahmad Husayn, Asyut deputy, 
and Jamil Abu-'Aqrab, Abu Tij deputy, blamed the NDP and corrupt 
officials for what is happening, particularly since everybody is 
competing for privileges and to obtain arms licenses for their 
family members. He claims that everybody is ignoring the 
expansion of terrorist activities in their villages and centers 
and in their families. 
  People's Assembly member 'Abd-al-Hafiz Abu-Hashish said that 
the seven terrorists who were killed recently in al-Zawiyah 
al-Hamra' in Cairo were located with the help of information 
provided by popular leaders in Asyut. But the security agencies 
overlooked this fact and gave all the credit to their men, he 
said. 
  When 'Abd-al-Muhsin Salih called for setting up popular 
committees in every village to stand up to terrorists, the 
governor replied angrily that the committee was formed two years 
ago on the orders of former Governor Major General Hasan 
al-Alfi, before he was appointed interior minister. It is known 
that al-Alfi encountered the same problems when he was governor 
of Asyut. President Mubarak intervened at the time to settle 
the dispute between the governor and popular leaders. 
  In another development, the security agencies in Asyut 
declared a maximum state of alert as a precaution against 
possible terrorist suicide operations in retaliation for the 
death of six members in the village of al-Balayzah and two 
others in al-Duwaynah, Abu-Tij, last Sunday, a senior security 
official in Asyut told AL-AHALI. A terrorist group attacked a 
police car on the way to the officers' guest house in Sadafa on 
the same day. 
  AL-AHALI has learned that the terrorists have set up four 
separate groups within the military wing so that the fall of one 
group will not lead the security apparatus to the remaining 
groups. The first group is in charge of attacking civilian 
targets, the second attacks trains and tourist cruises, the 
third banks, and the fourth attacks Coptic targets.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, in </F>
Tunis, by Nidal Qabalan, in London on 29 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Qabalan] 'Arafat told us that there were two 
possibilities behind the attack in which six Palestinians were 
killed yesterday in Jabalyah Camp. 
  ['Arafat] Either, and I wonder about this, it is that Rabin 
knows what is going on but is turning a blind eye, or that these 
acts are being committed by Israeli army units without Rabin's 
knowledge. In either case, it is a terrible situation that will 
have a grave effect on the entire peace process. 
  There are formations within the Israeli Army... [pauses] We 
are facing the same experience as our brothers the Algerians in 
Evian [Algerian pre-independence talks with the French] when an 
organization named OAS, or the Secret Army Organization, was 
formed from French Army personnel and French settlers. Now we 
are facing the same [type of] secret organization. 
  [Qabalan] In your opinion, what is the fate of 
Palestinian-Israeli talks in view of repeated Israeli massacres 
of the Palestinian people and PLO activists? 
  ['Arafat] There have been no... [pauses] There are no 
negotiations. What is happening is simply this: When they 
[Israeli officials] came here, they said: We will give you the 
final answer after going back to Rabin. We will convey the 
answer during the donors meeting. The donors meeting was held 
in Cairo last Thursday [24 March], but nothing happened. They 
postponed the answer till today, Tuesday. 
  [Qabalan] And, today? 
  ['Arafat] Today, before they gave the answer, the crime took 
place, the second massacre took place. Therefore, these are 
premeditated acts, no more and no less. I lay the 
responsibility at the doorstep of the co-sponsors of the [peace] 
conference. 
  [Qabalan] What, then, is the Israeli delegation doing in 
Cairo now? 
  ['Arafat] This delegation is not a delegation; it is an 
individual who will give an answer to us and to the Egyptian 
brothers. 
  [Qabalan] Thank you, President.

  [Text] Following the hideous massacre, the official 
Palestinian spokesman made the following statement: 
  The forces of the Israeli occupation have yesterday 
committed 
a new massacre against the children of our people in the 
occupied Gaza Strip when the Israeli Army fired at some 
Palestinian young activists while they were distributing 
political leaflets in Jabalyah to the masses of our people on 
the political developments that are currently under way. 
  When those youths stopped near a gas station, the army 
patrols and Arabic-speaking elements of the Israeli intelligence 
immediately opened fire on them, killing the six youths, as well 
as a woman and a man while passing by the place. 
  This new massacre -- which is being added to the series of 
the massacres committed by the Israeli Army and the armed 
settlers against the children of our people since the terrible 
massacre of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque, and before that since their 
occupation of our land and their attacks on our sanctities, 
freedom, and dignity and on our right in a dignified, free and 
independent life -- all these reveal the depth of the 
premeditated conspiracy in which some Israeli Army units and the 
armed settlers are implicated against our masses, our sanctities 
and land, which, in their totality, constitute hideous crimes 
and vile conspiracies against humanity, against our people and 
against the whole of the peace process. 
  This massacre will only increase our people's determination 
and adherence to obtain their legitimate rights. It is 
regrettable that all these crimes and violations are taking 
place at the same time when false crocodile tears are being shed 
over lost opportunities for a solution, and evasive talk is 
being heard on good intentions and on a desire for peace. 
  Genuine peace comes about by protecting the Palestinian 
people, their sanctities, lives and properties in accordance 
with international legitimacy, the last of which was declared in 
UN Security Council Resolution 904. This resolution calls for 
ensuring international protection for our people by providing an 
international presence in the Palestinian territories, disarming 
settlers, and evacuating the settlements which lie in the heart 
of our towns and amidst our people.

  [Text] The Fatah Movement has announced a general strike in 
the occupied territories in the aftermath of the martyrdom of 
eight Palestinians affiliated with the Fatah Hawks in the 
Jabalyah camp in the occupied Gaza Strip. The Fatah Movement 
threatened to step up clashes with the Israeli occupation 
authorities. 
  Israel Radio expressed fears today that the Jabalyah 
incident 
could influence the course of the negotiations and the peace 
process, particularly since brother President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 
'Arafat] has called for an urgent PLO meeting in Tunis to make a 
decision on this incident.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, "a Fatah leader in the </F>
Gaza Strip" by Hasan Abu-Zayid, place and date not given; from 
the "With the Events" feature] 
  [Text] [Abu-Zayid] Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, Fatah leader in the 
Gaza Strip, what do you have to say about what happened in 
Jabalyah yesterday? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] First, this is a very serious incident. It is 
an unforgivable act by the Israeli undercover units. To 
cold-bloodedly kill six Palestinians, six Fatah members, in 
broad daylight is an extremely dangerous thing. 
  [Abu-Zayid] But, the Israelis; that is, the military 
authorities have claimed that they were armed and masked. 
  [Abu-Zayidah] This is nothing new. The appearance of masked 
men on the Palestinian streets has become a familiar phenomenon. 
The same goes for carrying arms. This is no reason to kill 
them. If the Israeli authorities want to kill whoever uses a 
mask or carries arms, this means that they will kill hundreds of 
Palestinians every day. I do not think that this would be a 
reasonable thing to do. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Sufyan Abu-Zayidah: How does the typical 
Palestinian view current developments, particularly at this 
point in time when Israel and the PLO are attempting to resume 
their talks? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] The entire Palestinian people are deeply 
saddened and pained. They are shedding tears of blood on their 
martyrs. At present, they cannot conceive of negotiations or a 
peace agreement, of a resumption of the negotiations, or of a 
halt to them. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Have you submitted your recommendations to the 
PLO with regard to resuming or halting the negotiations? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] The Palestinian leadership is fully aware of 
even the most minute developments here. In light of these 
developments, the proper decision that will promote the 
Palestinian people's interests will be made. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Has there been a retreat in the Palestinian 
people's support for the peace process? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] The Palestinian people have not thus far seen 
any tangible result, even a modest one, from the peace process. 
On the contrary, since the convening of the Madrid conference, 
they have seen calamities. It goes without saying that this is 
bound to influence their convictions. Certainly, this latest 
incident will not help strengthen the Palestinian people's 
convictions regarding peace. Nonetheless, the Palestinian 
people hope that the Israeli Army will withdraw from the 
occupied territories so that peace may prevail in the region. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Notwithstanding these incidents, do you expect 
progress in the peace talks at present? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] The natural outcome of this incident should be 
the immediate withdrawal of the Israeli Army from Gaza Strip in 
general, and from Jabalyah Camp in particular. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, Fatah leader in Gaza Strip, 
thank you very much. 
  [Abu-Zayidah] You are welcome.

called on the brother strugglers abroad to act immediately in 
order to overcome all differences, to mend the rifts, to affirm 
and reinforce the principle of Fatah brotherhood, and to rally 
around the leadership of the movement's leader, Yasir 'Arafat, 
with the aim of thwarting the enemies and their henchmen. 
  Fatah also warned those whom it described as conspirators 
who 
issue leaflets against some leading officials in the movement.

  [Text] The unified command of the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] and the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] has appealed to Fatah members and 
cadres and the Fatah Hawks in the occupied territories to 
withdraw their confidence from 'Arafat's leadership and rebel 
against its orders, policies, and course as this leadership has 
given up national rights. This came in a statement issued by 
the two fronts' unified command. 
  The unified command said that the massacre of Jabaliya in 
Gaza once again shows that the occupation does not differentiate 
among the revolution's strugglers, and that it pursues its 
terrorism against all the sons of the Palestinian people. 
  For his part, DFLP secretary General Nayif Hawatimah has 
emphasized the need to immediatley stop wagering on the U.S. 
Administration. He called for discarding the belief that 
Washington will bring pressure to bear on Israel, as the 
Oslo-Cairo agreement proponents claim. Hawatimah called on 
those who defend this agreement to give up their positions in 
the PLO.

  [Excerpt] Jerusalem -- The Supreme Islamic Council has 
called on the Palestinian leadership in particular and the Arab 
states in general to withdraw from the current Arab-Israeli 
talks. It also stressed the need to stand firmly against U.S. 
positions, which are biased in favor of the Israeli party. 
  This demand, which is the first of its kind since the Madrid 
conference was convened about 20 months ago, came in an urgent 
telegram by the council following its meeting yesterday morning 
in Jerusalem. In the meeting, the council discussed the assault 
against Islamic sanctities and the Palestinian people, 
especially the recent massacre perpetrated by Israeli settlers 
in Hebron's al-Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  The council criticized remarks by U.S. President Bill 
Clinton 
and Israeli officials on the fate of holy Jerusalem, as well as 
the U.S. Administration's stance on UN Security Council 
Resolution 904. It called on Arab and Islamic countries to 
clearly determine their stance on the U.S. Administration in 
light of its biased positions toward the Israeli side. [passage

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Israel's Military Hurting Peace Prospects"] </F>
  [Text] Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat expressed 
concern after the Hebron massacre, and rightly so, that the 
Israeli Army and settlers are conspiring to derail the peace 
talks. We had no doubt that the settlers would do something to 
kill the peace process. What surprises us is the army's attempt 
to do the same. 
  The army's actions in Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
speak for themselves. In Lebanon, the Israeli army reacted to 
attacks against army bases by shelling civilian centers in south 
Lebanon outside the so-called security zone. The result was the 
brutal and merciless murder and injury of children when Israeli 
army shells hit a school bus. Then the Israeli army dares to 
complain when Katyusha rockets fall on vacant land in northern 
Israel and threaten to react harshly, as if the damage and pain 
already done was not enough. 
  In the West Bank, the Israeli army fired rockets at a house 
in the heart of Hebron, allegedly in pursuit of armed 
Palestinian activists. For 18 hours, the army engaged the 
Palestinians and opened fire on them from all directions with 
the intention to kill. The severity of the shelling only proves 
that the army had no intention to take the Palestinians alive. 
Finally, after killing four activists and a pregnant mother 
sitting in her home, the army demolished the house. 
  All this happened while Hebron was still under curfew since 
the massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque on Feb. 25. Every time the 
army lifts the curfew for a few hours, a young Palestinian or 
two is shot and killed by the military. The TV news clearly 
shows that the army opens fire and shoots at demonstrators all 
the time. It also shows children shot while running away from 
army bullets and not threatening anyone. So, they have no 
excuse to open fire at them. 
  The testimonies of ranking army officers at the Israeli 
Commission of Inquiry try to justify the army and the settlers' 
trigger-happy policy in the occupied territories. In reality, 
they only prove that the army has one mode of thinking: the gun 
is the only means of negotiating. 
  With Yitzhaq Rabin serving as Israel's prime minister and 
number one decision-maker, as well as serving as defense 
minister responsible for the army's actions, one is left to 
wonder what his real intentions are. If we assume his 
intentions are the same as his generals, then the peace process 
is in real trouble. It is then up to the civilian members of 
the Israeli Cabinet to correct this defect, if they are really 
interested in a peace settlement.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Clinton's Statements On Jerusalem Have </F>
Deprived Washington of the Sponsor's Role"] 
  [Text] Citing U.S. President Bill Clinton's statement to 
the effect that "united Jerusalem is the capital of Israel," 
U.S. Jewish leaders said that this position is compatible with 
the commitment that he made during his election campaign. If 
the U.S. president really made this statement, and there are 
indications that he did, this means that the current U.S. 
Administration has adopted a stance contrary to official U.S. 
positions on Jerusalem advocated by previous administrations. 
In addition such a stance is a flagrant violation of 
international legitimacy and resolutions relating to the 
Arab-Israeli conflict. 
  This stance also affirms that the U.S. Administration cannot 
play the role of honest broker in the peace talks, especially 
when the Palestinian-Israeli accord has clearly specified that 
the status of Jerusalem will be at the top of the list of issues 
to be discussed during the final stage talks between the 
Palestinian and Israeli sides. 
  This position, attributed to Clinton, was preceded by the 
U.S. abstention in the Security Council vote on a clause 
affirming that Jerusalem was part of the occupied Palestinian 
territories. The vote was within context of a resolution on the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. On this basis, Clinton's recent 
statement is not separate from the U.S. position's farce in the 
Security Council during the deliberations over the massacre and 
from what he stated during his election campaign. 
  Therefore, those voices which considered Clinton's 
statements 
during the election campaign as being mere lip service to gain 
the American Jewish vote in the elections should now realize 
their mistake. They should also realize that what is happening 
now is a clear shift in the U.S. position -- one that seeks to 
be in harmony with the Israeli position and that ignores and 
denies the rights of the Palestinian people and the Arab and 
Islamic nations in Jerusalem. 
  In sum, a U.S. stance that is so clear and grave on a 
central 
problem in the Arab-Israeli conflict calls for a serious 
assessment of the U.S. role in the peace talks. The U.S. 
Administration's continued fulfillment of the sponsor's role in 
the peace talks while adopting Israel's positions means that it 
has lost any credibility in playing such a role and that it has 
lost the legitimacy of intervening in the talks, especially as 
it has defied international legitimacy and its resolutions, on 
which the foundations of the peace process are based.

Threat of Postponement and Inclination To Suspend Its Work"] 
  [Excerpt] Tunis -- On 2 April Tunisia will host the sixth 
Arab Maghreb Union [UMA] summit conference but there is a 
possibility that the summit might yet again be postponed and 
there are fears that its work might be suspended. 
  Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali recently chaired 
a 
limited cabinet meeting to discuss the summit, the normal 
transfer of the UMA chairmanship from Tunisia to Algeria, and a 
follow-up of the implementation of the agreements and 
achievements made during the period of Tunisia's chairmanship 
throughout 1993. 
  Although the date of the sixth Maghreb summit is only five 
days away, the fear of the summit being postponed for the fourth 
time still exists. 
  Observers have confirmed to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that it is 
feared that a number of the UMA leaders may not attend the 
summit. So far there has been no support, at least not from 
Morocco and Libya, for the holding of the summit. 
  Diplomatic observers have expressed fears that a further 
postponement of the sixth Maghreb summit might open the way for 
interpretations and claims as a result of which the UMA's 
activities might be suspended. 
  The summit has already been postponed three times. [passage

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Mar (MENA)--A study prepared by the Arab 
League has stressed that the decisions of the Uruguay round of 
the GATT agreement will negatively affect the Arab countries in 
the areas of development, economic growth, exports, and imports; 
will shift the Arab trade balance in favor of the advanced 
countries; and will increase the unemployment rate in the Arab 
countries as a natural consequence of the liberalization of 
international trade. 
  The study, which was prepared by the Arab League's General 
Department of Economic Affairs, on the expected consequences of 
the GATT agreement on the Arab economy, said that the outcome of 
the principle of liberalization of international trade, which is 
the basis of the agreement, will favor the industrial countries 
whose products and services enjoy a superior level of quality. 
It added that these countries will benefit from the 
implementation of the agreement in tackling the unemployment 
problem and increasing world demand for their products, and that 
the world trade growth rate will increase in favor of these 
countries. 
  The study then said that, according to the agreement's 
clauses, special privileges will be granted to members of some 
economic groupings--namely countries belonging to the EU's 
Maastricht Treaty, the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA), and the Rome Agreement. 
  It then explained that the deteriorating Arab growth rates 
of 
agricultural and industrial production confirm that the 
consequences of implementing the agreement will not be in favor 
of the Arab countries whose agricultural production represents 
only 1.5 percent of the overall world agricultural production 
while their industrial production represents only 0.5 percent of 
world production. 
  The study pointed out that the price of agricultural and 
food 
products will treble as a result of the GATT decisions; this 
will absorb a major part of the Arab countries' financial 
revenues. It noted that current Arab agricultural imports total 
around $21 billion annually. 
  It said that with the increase in the price of agricultural 
imports, the deficit in the Arab balances of payments will 
consequently increase; this will, in turn, lead to a similar 
increase in the deficits of public budgets. 
  According to the agreement, agricultural subsidies for the 
member countries' production will be repealed and hence the 
(?Arab) countries will find themselves at a great disadvantage 
vis-a-vis agricultural imports from abroad, as the price of 
imported goods will be less than that of local Arab goods. This 
threatens to destroy Arab agricultural production in the long 
term unless advanced agricultural development is achieved. 
  The study called for developing systems of Arab 
agricultural production, food security, and water availability 
in the future to help the Arab states face outside competition. 
The study highlighted the need to turn to agricultural 
mechanization; improve agricultural packing, transportation, 
storage, and marketing methods; cut back on consumption; and 
eliminate agricultural waste in production, transportation, and 
storage. 
  The study touched on the GATT's effects on Arab industrial 
commodities. It pointed out that the Arab states will face 
tough competition in the future in the field of industrial 
products, particularly since raw materials represent a 
considerable part of Arab exports. In the meantime, the major 
industrial states endeavor to develop new alternatives to the 
raw materials they obtain from the developing nations, something 
that will weaken the competitive position of the Arab world. In 
this regard, the study noted that the Arab states have 
difficulty promoting Arab industrial products as an alternative 
to foreign imports, except in limited areas. For instance, the 
Arab world produces 10 million tons of iron annually, while the 
Arab markets need more than 16 million tons. 
  The study emphasized that under the GATT agreement, a number 
of Arab industries will be affected by tough international 
competition, including petrochemicals, wooden products, 
ready-made clothing, paper, printing, and publishing industries. 
The study called for applying the rules of research and 
development and introducing quality methods and world standards 
on specifications to save Arab industries. 
  On the freeing of trade in services, the study noted that 
this will result in unequal competition within the Arab markets 
in the fields of banking, insurance, transportation, tourism, 
communications, construction, cultural production, and aviation 
because the Arab states are importers of services. Meanwhile, 
these services are highly advanced in the developed nations. 
  The GATT has expanded the concept of world trade to include 
government purchases, including purchases by the army, police, 
local governments, and public utilities, in which the public 
tenders will be subject to free world competition. Accordingly, 
the advanced states will gain a larger share of government 
tenders, which will amount to $100 billion in the year 2000, as 
compared to $22 billion in 1990. 
  The study concluded that the Arab world will be greatly 
affected in the fields of government purchases and tenders for 
infrastructure and public sector projects. It also concluded 
that the Arab states will incur losses in the short and medium 
terms in the areas of agricultural and industrial production and 
services, while the price of imported commodities is expected to 
rise. 
  The study recommended the need to devise integrated and 
modern economic and trade policies that rely on a common Arab 
will to remedy the expected losses. 
  The GATT's decisions were issued during the Uruguay round 
last December. There are 115 member states of the GATT and two 
observer countries. Among the member states there are eight 
Arab countries: Egypt, Bahrain, Tunisia, Kuwait, Mauritania, 
Morocco, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 29 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysian 
Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed Tuesday [29 March] expressed 
disappointment with the poor turnout of leaders at the ongoing 
summit here of the Group of 15 (G-15) developing countries, 
attended by only six of the heads of government. 
  The leaders of at least 10 nations had pledged to attend the 
meeting, he told Malaysian journalists covering the summit. 
  Those attending the three-day meeting are Dr. Mahathir, 
President Suharto of Indonesia, President Abdou Diouf of 
Senegal, President Sani Abacha of Nigeria, President Robert 
Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Prime Minister Narasimha Rao of host 
India. 
  Absent are the heads of government of Algeria, Brazil, 
Chile, 
Egypt, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela. The incoming G-15 
chairman, President Carlos Menem of Argentina, is scheduled to 
be present on the last day of the meeting. 
  The absent leaders had cited, among other things, pressing 
domestic problems as their reason for staying away. 
  Nevertheless, Dr. Mahathir said, the leaders who attended 
were really serious about wanting to undertake all the 
programmes of the grouping. 
  He also said that the meeting came up with a formula to get 
around the insufficient quorum of attendance by requiring only 
eight leaders to make up the quorum instead of the previous 10. 
  Of the eight, at least five must be heads of government 
while 
the other three must be acting, deputy or vice heads of 
government, he added. 
  Dr. Mahathir said the decision would be made known to all 
member nations. 
  Asked whether the absence of many of the heads of government 
at the ongoing summit reflected their level of commitment to the 
G-15, he said the majority of the leaders remained committed to 
the grouping. 
  From the letters and the representatives, many of them 
foreign ministers, sent by the leaders, I gather that there is 
commitment. 
  Although some countries did not send any representative, six 
nations sent top-level delegations. It is clear, therefore, 
that the majority remain committed, he said. 
  Dr. Mahathir acknowledged that it was not easy to get all 15 
heads of government to together [as received] at the same time. 
  On a suggestion for the summit to be held biennially, he 
said 
the majority of the leaders present at the ongoing meeting 
seemed to want to retain the present annual session.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 29 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysian 
Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said Tuesday [29 March] the 
West's attempts to push developing countries to have a minimum 
wage for workers were directed at producer nations such as 
Malaysia, Indonesia and India. 
  The attempts to impose the minimum wage started after the 
Group of Seven (G-7) held a meeting recently to discuss 
unemployment in the developed countries, he told Malaysian 
journalists covering the ongoing summit of the Group of 15 
(G-15) developing countries here. 
  Their aim is clear, they want to make it impossible for us 
to 
sell our goods. 
  When workers are paid high wages, factories will have to 
close, the workers will lose their jobs and then the 
unemployment in the developed countries will be solved, he said. 
  Dr. Mahathir said the developed countries did not take into 
account the fact that the standard of living was usually low in 
developing countries and that the workers were not yet ready to 
adjust to a high standard of living. All this while, the 
developed countries had imposed various regulations on 
developing countries linked with trade, such as the question of 
democracy, human rights and the environment. 
  He said the heads of government at the G-15 summit where 
they 
had raised the issue of the minimum wage, agreed that developing 
countries did not want the West to impose its systems and 
perceptions on the issues of democracy, human rights, the 
environment and minimum wage. 
  The question of trade should be separate from any unrelated 
condition, he said, adding that Western countries seemed [word 
indistinct]. He said, the United States still talked of Super 
301, on the imposition of conditions on certain countries in 
their trade. 
  Dr. Mahathir also said that the plenary session of the G-15 
summit was agreed that the structure of the United Nations must 
be reorganised for it to be more democratic. 
  He said it was undemocratic for a superpower in the UN to 
veto the wish of the majority of member nations. 
  If this continues, their talk of democracy will be 
meaningless. They want to force democracy on all other countries 
but there is no democracy in the UN itself, he said. 
  Dr. Mahathir said the voice of the majority could not be 
simply dismissed just because five big countries in the UN held 
the veto power. 
  He also said the other G-15 member countries shared 
Malaysia's view that the Western media always carried adverse 
reports on the developing countries. 
  However, he added, some of these countries feared that they 
would be the target of the Western media if they stated their 
stand openly in the matter. 
  Dr. Mahathir said the Western countries assumed that they 
had 
more rights than other countries. 
  While we do not interfere in their affairs, they feel they 
can not only interfere in ours but also direct any country to 
follow their concepts, failing which they will impose various 
forms of pressure, he said. 
  He said Western countries had yet to understand that a 
sovereign nation had the right to manage its domestic matters on 
its own.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 29 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The G-15 
summit here feels that the Bilateral Payment Arrangement (BPA) 
which Malaysia has implemented will enhance trade among 
countries of the South. 
  Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said 
Tuesday 
[29 March] trade among countries which had opted for the 
arrangement had shown remarkable progress in terms of the volume 
involved. 
  Trade had grown from about RM [Malaysian ringgit] 1 billion 
(about US$370 million) in 1989 to RM4 billion (about US$1.48 
billion) last year, he told Malaysian reporters covering the 
three- day summit which began Monday. 
  He said heads of government attending the G-15 summit felt 
that the success proved that the BPA had become an effective 
mechanism to promote trade among countries of the South. 
  Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed informed the 
other heads of government attending the summit that Malaysia 
would strive to get more countries to sign the BPA. So far 19 
countries had signed the agreement. 
  On the North-South dialogue, Abdullah said all G-25 leaders 
felt that it was an important agenda and they hoped that the 
dialogue would benefit developing countries. 
  On Malaysia's proposal that academic excellence centres be 
set up in G-15 member countries, Abdullah said it was not 
discussed at the plenary session because the foreign ministers 
had already accepted the proposal at their meeting two days ago. 
  He said efforts to identify suitable institutions for the 
purpose would be made as soon as possible in member countries 
even though several countries had still to state their views on 
the proposal. The centres would be set up in countries which had 
agreed to the proposal and which were ready to implement it, 
Abdullah said.

  [Text] President Suharto stressed that Indonesia is willing 
to extend its current term of the Nonaligned Movement leadership 
for another term lasting between six months to one year only if 
the members of NAM find it difficult to appoint another chairman. 
  This was stated by Foreign Minister Ali Alatas to newsmen in 
New Delhi today. He said Indonesia is willing to extend its NAM 
chairmanship only if the NAM members find it difficult to 
appoint a new chairman. 
  President Suharto stated that Indonesia was of the opinion 
that several members have the capability to lead the movement 
and the appointment of the new chairman should be carried out in 
an orderly manner. Indonesia became the chairman of the NAM in 
1992 after the holding of the high-level summit conference in 
Jakarta. Indonesia's current term of chairmanship will 
terminate in 1995. 
  During his meeting with the Indian prime minister, the head 
of state, as the leader of the NAM, expressed his hope that a 
decision would be made in connection with the leadership issue 
during the upcoming foreign ministers meeting in Cairo from 1-4 
June. A senior officials meeting will precede the high-level 
foreign ministers meeting from 30-31 May in Cairo.

  [Text] Cairo -- Dr. Nabil Sha'th has said that the 
accusations leveled by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' 
against the PLO about resuming the talks with Israel without 
coordinating with other Arab states were unjustified. 
  He added: It should be noted that the negotiations in which 
we have been engaged since the Security Council issued its 
resolution are based on the resolution itself. This is an 
intensive effort to implement Resolution 904. 
  Responding to al-Shar', Sha'th said: We insist on Arab 
coordination. If there is a problem, it is because in Madrid, 
the Arab parties' accepted a phased solution interim period for 
the Palestinians. Hence, the Arab agreement was and continues 
to be that the PLO should hasten to achieve its phased solution 
so that there will be a single negotiating stage with the other 
parties over a final solution.

  [Text] Cairo, 29 Mar (MENA)--An Israeli delegation headed 
by Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq arrived in Cairo at noon 
today for talks with a Palestinian team on the implementation of 
Security Council Resolution 904 concerning international 
protection for Palestinians in Hebron and the occupied 
territories. 
  The two delegations are expected to sign an agreement in 
this 
regard if particular obstacles concerning international 
protection are overcome. The two sides will then resume their 
negotiations on implementing the Gaza-Jericho Accord. Those 
negotiations broke off after the Israeli massacre in the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron on 25 February.

  Sources close to negotiations say that the delay in going to 
the venue of the talks is because they want to hold the talks in 
a secret place, away from reporters and television cameras. The 
delegation is also waiting for instructions from the Palestinian 
leadership in Tunis to begin negotiations. 
  The Israeli delegation to the talks arrived in Cairo at noon 
today.

  [Text] Cairo, March 29 (AFP) -- Israel and the PLO began 
talks here Tuesday [29 March] in secret aimed at reviving the 
stalled autonomy negotiations despite the killing of six 
Palestinian activists by the army, Palestinian officials said. 
  The two sides met to hammer out security plans for the West 
Bank town of Hebron, where a Jewish settler massacred 30 Arabs 
last month, and clear the way for the last leg of talks on 
launching autonomy in Gaza and Jericho. 
  The talks went ahead after 'Arafat called an emergency 
meeting in the PLO's Tunis headquarters to discuss the impact of 
the killings of six members of the Fatah Hawks by the Israeli 
army in the occupied Gaza Strip late Monday. 
  The Hawks are the armed wing of 'Arafat's Fatah faction of 
the PLO. 
  The Fatah leader in the Gaza Strip, Zakariya al-Agha, told 
journalists that he shared the people's "feeling that the talks 
have to be suspended for a while." 
  Al-Agha asked: "For how long do we have to be subjected to 
these massacres, even though a peace process is going on." 
  He called for international protection to guarantee the 
safety of Palestinians and rejected as insufficient military 
regrets about the incident. 
  The PLO broke off the autonomy negotiations after the 
February 25 Hebron massacre and has said it will not resume them 
until it receives proper security guarantees for the occupied 
territories. 
  Differences exist on the nationality and number of foreign 
observers to be deployed in Hebron as well as on the number of 
Palestinian policemen and the type of weapons they should have, 
according to negotiators.

'Arafat, and General Amnon Shahaq, Israel's deputy chief of 
staff, met at 1900 today at a secret location in Cairo. The

requested in view of the conditions in the occupied Arab 
territories. 
  The drafting committee began its meeting at approximately 
2200 and is expected to work late into the night. The remaining 
members of the Israeli and Palestinian delegations have retired 
to their quarters.

  [Text] Cairo, 30 Mar (MENA)--MENA has learned that the 
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators will resume their extensive 
secret meetings in Cairo at noon today after the Palestinian 
leadership's reply to the new draft agreement on security 
measures in Hebron, which was completed at dawn today, is 
received from Tunis. 
  The drafting committee, which comprised, on the Palestinian 
side, president 'Arafat's political adviser Nabil Sha'th and 
Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya and, on the Israeli 
side, 'Uzi Dayan, deputy director of the Defense Ministry's 
planning administration, and Yo'el Singer, legal adviser at the 
Foreign Ministry, held a meeting last night, which continued 
until dawn today. This meeting followed a three-hour private 
meeting between the head of the Palestinian delegation, Nabil 
Sha'th, and the head of the Israeli delegation, General Amnon 
Shahaq. 
  Sources close to the negotiators told MENA that the 
Palestinian leadership will meet in Tunis later today to examine 
the new draft agreement on security measures and international 
protection in Hebron and to inform the two delegations of its 
view of the agreement. Afterward, the two delegations will hold 
an extensive meeting to discuss the details of the agreement. 
  The same sources said the worsening situation in the 
occupied 
territories and the outbreak of clashes in which over 66 people 
were killed and wounded dominated the atmosphere of the 
negotiations, which was tense at first and relaxed gradually as 
the negotiators began to discuss substantial issues. 
  The sources added that the Israeli side proposed the 
presence 
of 100 Palestinian policemen in Hebron and 70 international 
observers armed with light weapons and able to move freely. 
  The sources said that if the wording of the agreement on 
security measures in Hebron is completed today, the negotiators 
will turn immediately, as of tomorrow, Thursday, to the 
discussion of issues concerning the Gaza-Jericho Accord. 
Discussion was suspended following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre in Hebron on 25 February. 
  The agency has learned that intense international contacts 
took place with the Palestinian leadership in Tunis all day 
yesterday to make the Palestinian leadership give its delegation 
in Cairo the green light to restart negotiations on security 
measures and international protection in Hebron after the 
killing of six members of the Fatah Hawks in Gaza two days ago 
by a special unit from the Israeli Army and the death of a 
Palestinian woman and a man who were on the scene. 
  The agency also learned that Israel agreed to vanguards of 
the Palestinian police force entering Gaza and Jericho directly 
following the resumption of the negotiations concerning 
Palestinian self-rule in these two areas.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following review of the 23 March 
issue of Cairo AL-NUR summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  NOTE ON AL-NUR'S PUBLICATION, FORMAT: </H5>
  The current editorial report describes the contents of the 
23 
March 1994 issue of AL-NUR, the first issue of this publication 
received by Nicosia Bureau since January 1994. 
  The last issue received of AL-NUR, which has the serial 
number 599, does not give a day of publication, only naming the 
month of publication as January. The current issue, with serial 
number 600, is presumably consecutive to the January issue. In 
an inscription added to the front page's top right-hand square 
carrying the paper's title, the paper describes itself as an 
"Islamic Weekly," which did not appear in earlier issues in the 
Bureau's files. The paper does not give a reason for the hiatus 
in its publication. 
  The current issue displays no notable change in AL-NUR's 
format. The front page caption still cites al-Hamzah Di'bis as 
chairman of the board and 'Ali Faruq as chief editor. The paper 
is still "issued by the Liberal Party," but the caption fails to 
display the information that Mustafa Kamil Murad is the "party 
leader," as it did in the previous editions on file here. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Television programs denounced 
  2. Al-Azhar Schools Close Down 
  3. Red Cross Publication Praised 
  4. Muslim Figures Interviewed 
  5. Co-ed Colleges Denounced 
  6. Extremist Disavows AL-AKHBAR Interview 
<H5>  TELEVISION PROGRAMS DENOUNCED </H5>
  An 800-word commentary by "AL-NUR's political editor" 
appears 
on page 1 under a triple headline: "Television Assails Islam and 
Its Tenets Under the Pretext of Fighting Terror; What Shall We 
Tell Our Children About the Television's Edict Banning Cucumber 
and Zucchini? The Solution in the Television's Opinion is That 
an Unveiled Girl Should Lead the Muslims Into the Desert." 
  The political editor begins his commentary by lauding the 
Islamic propensities of slain President Anwar al-Sadat and 
denouncing what he sees as the secular policies of the current 
government. He writes: 
  "The late President Anwar al-Sadat, God bless his soul, 
struck at communism, expelled Russian experts from Egypt, and 
issued presidential decrees liquidating the Vanguard 
Organization of the Arab Socialist Party, the Youth 
Organization. Having led the nation to victory in the 
October/Ramadan [1973] war, he restored freedoms and the 
multi-party system and began to Islamize the laws, a goal that 
he entrusted to al-Azhar professors, law experts, and members of 
the judiciary. Meanwhile, communists and members of the defunct 
Vanguard and Youth Organizations lurked in the dark. No sooner 
had al-Sadat passed on then those communists and Vanguard and 
Youth Organization officials returned to office with only one 
object in mind: killing al-Sadat's memory and accomplishments 
every living day." 
  The editor then expands on television dramas that, he 
claims, 
"poke fun at Islam" by ridiculing religion among youth and the 
Islamic dress code. 
<H5>  AL-AZHAR SCHOOLS CLOSE DOWN: </H5>
  A 600-word report on page 1 by Safwat al-Sandafawi cites 
Shaykh Muhammad Bashir 'Abd-al-'Al, director general of al-Azhar 
institutions, as saying that "1,500 al-Azhar institutions have 
been closed down due to a lack of funds needed to rehabilitate 
the school buildings that cracked in last year's earthquake." 
Shaykh 'Abd-al-'Al says that 294 million pounds [approximately 
$80 million] are needed to put the schools back in working 
order. Al-Azhar has petitioned the government for these funds, 
but "the government did not oblige," the al-Azhar official says. 
<H5>  RED CROSS PUBLICATION PRAISED </H5>
  Chairman of the Board al-Hamzah Di'bis writes a 1,500-word 
editorial on the front page entitled, "International Committee 
of the Red Cross Applauds Islam's Global Rules of War and 
Peace." Di'bis says that Liberal Party leader Mustafa Kamil 
Murad gave him a Red Cross publication called, "From the Records 
of Arab Islamic History." He then reviews this publication, 
commending its favorable view of Islamic traditions. 

<H5>    MUSLIM FIGURES INTERVIEWED </H5>
  On page 2, the paper carries interviews with Chief Bosnian 
Ulema Shaykh Mustafa Ibrahim and a U.S. physician, Barbara 
Klein, who converted to Islam. The Bosnian official deplores 
the attacks on Muslims in his country and says that there is "an 
orchestrated policy to eradicate Islam from Europe." Dr. Klein 
praises her adopted faith and denounces U.S. support for Israel. 
<H5>  CO-ED COLLEGES DENOUNCED </H5>
  A 3,500-word report by Sayyid Farghal appears on page 3. He 
interviews a dozen students from various universities, all of 
whom believe that mixed education is both unnecessary and 
unethical and that all-male and all-female colleges are morally 
commendable and educationally superior to co-ed universities. 
  "Distinguished Islamic scholar" Dr. 'Abd-al-Rashid Saqr, 
"Islamic scholar" Dr. Muhammad 'Imarah; Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman 
al-'Adawi, Professor of religious studies at al-Azhar 
University; Dr. Majdi Hasan, professor of Civil Law at 'Ayn 
Shams University; Dr. Muhammad Farahat, professor of shari'ah at 
'Ayn Shams University; and 'Uthman Muhammad 'Uthman, an 
education expert, concur with this view. 
  Farghal's interviews include no co-ed supporters. 
<H5>  EXTREMIST DISAVOWS AL-AKHBAR INTERVIEW </H5>
  Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Samawi writes a 2,000-word "Rebuttal of 
Sabir Shawkat" on page 5. Al-Samawi, a one-time friend of 
Shawqi al-Shaykh and Muhammad 'Abd-al-Baqi, co-founders of 
al-Shawqiyun group, is rumored to have issued the license 
[al-istihlal] edict by which Muslim extremists are encouraged to 
steal from infidels, i.e., anyone that is not an extremist. 
  Al-Samawi had been interviewed by an AL-AKHBAR journalist 
named Sabir Shawkat who published an account of that interview 
in AL-AKHBAR's issue at the beginning of Sha'ban [around 12 
January], which al-Samawi vehemently disavows. 
  For example, Shawkat wrote that he "faced al-Samawi with the 
details of his crimes against Egypt and the youths whom he sent 
into the dark tunnels of extremism." Al-Samawi says "he did not 
face me with one crime." 
  Al-Samawi writes: "What crime have I committed against Egypt 
and its youth? Is it that I urged youth to stick to Islam and 
be proud of it? Is it that I made them turn to God and attend 
prayers? Is it that I made them desert the disreputable haunts 
and head to the places of worship? Or, is it that I made them 
follow the path of God and pray for his blessing?" He adds: "I 
have been imprisoned for 12 years without being indicted, 
without a court ruling, and without doing any wrong or 
committing any crime." 
  Al-Samawi says: "The AL-AKHBAR journalist has cited me as 
saying, `I do not deny that I am the first who called for amirs 
to lead the Islamic groups in Egypt, 20 years ago, and the first 
who formed religious groups since the Muslim brotherhood, but 
now I call for paradise.' I ask you, journalist, is this what I 
said or what you invented?" 
  Al-Samawi adds: "The journalist wrote, `concerning the 
extremist ideas that he [al-Samawi] inculcated into thousands of 
youth, he [al-Samawi] said: I have never sanctioned license 
[al-istihlal].'" 
  Ridiculing Shawkat, al-Samawi writes: "If I have not passed 
the license edict, then what brand of extremism have I 
inculcated into the minds of thousands? Or is it that I am 
accused of having spread moderation through failure to pass that 
edict?" 
  Al-Samawi denies having told Shawkat that "al-Shawqiyun and 
other groups have sanctioned the practice of license." He also 
denies having said that he "indoctrinated thousands of youth who 
then deserted me and joined other groups where they became a 
fuel for terror, and I am opposed to their terrorist operations." 
  Al-Samawi continues his defiant rebuttal of Shawkat's 
account 
of the interview, but refrains from expressing his opinion on 
terrorism or giving any clear statement on his current political 
position.

<F P=106> [Article by Counselor Muhammad Sa'id al-'Ashmawi: "Religion </F>
and Ideology"] 
  [Text] One of the most difficult things for a normal human 
being to achieve during his lifetime is to set or absorb a 
definition for each subject, idea, or opinion. As a result, 
most people lead a blurred existence where concepts are not 
defined, issues are not clarified, and a balance is not 
attained. Since the condition of such a life is continuous 
blindness where objects and people always clash against each 
other, the result will be successive catastrophes leading to a 
confusion of religion and ideology. When things get to this 
stage, religion deteriorates from being a belief into being a 
sect and topples from religious tolerance to a rigid system. 
Therefore, what is religion and what is ideology? 
  It is difficult to find one definition for religion. 
However, one of its definitions is a sense of spirituality 
regarding the existence of an omnipotent single supreme power. 
This feeling becomes manifest in the various courses of life 
and is reflected in various behaviors. As for ideology, it 
consists of theories and the comprehensive objectives that 
constitute the basis for a social and political program. This 
is known as an ideology. 
  Islam is the religion. But the doctrines followed by some 
groups, especially the political Islam groups, are an ideology, 
not religion. This is because once politics enters religion, it 
destroys the latter's concepts, changes its content, and 
influences its essence. Religion is more noble than a doctrine, 
finer than regimes, more comprehensive than theories, and above 
taking sides and joining groups. When religion is restricted to 
an ideology, confined within a system, summarized into a theory, 
or formed into a party or group, when this happens it detracts 
from the freedom and divinity of religion and transforms it into 
a sectarian struggle, fighting regimes, contradicting theories, 
or clashing parties. 
  This cannot be justified by claiming that the Prophet, God's 
peace and blessings be upon him, practiced religion through 
politics. The reality is that when the Prophet, God's peace and 
blessings be upon him, practiced politics, he did so as part of 
his message with the intention of spreading it. This, according 
to Islamic understanding, took place under the supervision and 
follow- up of the inspiration, where every shortcoming was 
rectified on the spot. Any Muslim who attempts to practice 
politics after the Prophet's time, God's peace and blessings be 
upon him, where there is neither prophet nor inspiration, does 
so to realize certain goals and specific objectives. He does 
not do so because he is following a message from God or a part 
of a prophesy. Prophesies are over and done with. Evidence of 
this is that when politics infiltrated Islam, the great sedition 
took place. Muslims were divided into various parties--the 
Umayyads, the Hashemites, the Khawarijites [the oldest dissident 
religious sect of Islam], and other such parties. Each of these 
parties portrays the other as a heretic, and believes that its 
ideology is the absolute and the whole. Whoever does not adopt 
the ideology of that group becomes a rival, nay even an enemy, 
that must be fought and defeated. His blood and property become 
sanctioned. The practice of the Islamic parties and groups 
becomes killing each other and sanctioning the blood of Muslims 
outside their groups. Then, this turned into a war against 
Islam to kill Muslims. 
  Religion brings people together, and religious ideology 
divides them. Religion unites and ideology fragments. Religion 
reconciles people and ideology separates them. Religion is 
forgiving and ideology creates grudges. This is because 
religion comes from a perfect God while ideology was created by 
imperfect man. 
  This is why loyalty in religion is to God and God alone, 
the God of all mankind. All people are considered the family of 
God: They learn and practice the values of religion, accept and 
apply its morality, become linked to its history, and then 
spread it throughout humanity. When talking about ideology, 
loyalty is to the organization, or the party, or the group; 
belief is in the ideology even though it may be wrong; 
allegiance is to the amir even if he is misguided; obedience is 
to the rules set by mankind regardless of how clearly they 
contradict religion or call for killing innocent people or 
destroying homelands. 
  Many people have noticed that religious ideology is bad and 
that it is based, in the first place, on dividing people for 
earthly reasons. It is based primarily on changing religion 
into warring parties and fighting groups. These people have 
fought this ideology and made enemies with it. But because of 
the difficulty in setting definitions, and the confusion in and 
vagueness of issues, their enemies -- that is, the supporters of 
ideology -- accused them of being enemies of religion. The 
former, in actual fact, are the enemies of ideology, not 
religion. They might even be more religious and stronger 
believers than the people with ideologies who believe only in 
their ideology, adhere to the opinion of an individual, and obey 
the orders of a human being. 
  Ideology is the true enemy and actual foe of religion. This 
is because it restricts religion to one ideology, when religion 
has the capacity to incorporate many ideologies; ideology 
confines religion to the opinion of one person, while religion 
has the capacity to absorb many opinions; it limits religion 
inside empty slogans while religion rises above all slogans; it 
explains religion through general terms, while religion is based 
on a text and specific explanations. In the name of this 
ideology, many institutions have been created throughout history 
all over the world, monopolizing allegiance to themselves and 
waging wars in their own interests. They falsely allege that 
loyalty should be to them, not to God, and that wars are 
religious, while religion has nothing to do with war and killing. 
  Perhaps it is vital in this age, where many issues are 
intertwined, values are vague, and knowledge ambiguous, to 
clarify all matters, thus leaving no room for ambiguity or 
inadequacy. Facts should be made clear and specified. Religion 
should be distinguished from ideology. Religious laws should be 
distinguished from sectarianism to stress that religion is from 
God and ideology comes from humans. What stems from God calls 
for unity in worshipping the one and only God. No man or 
doctrine other than God's should be worshipped. "The same 
religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on 
Noah - the which We have sent by inspiration to thee and that 
which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: Namely that ye 
should remain steadfast in religion and make no divisions 
therein." [Koranic verse] "Say: "O people of the book! Come to 
common terms as between us and you: that we worship none but 
God." [Koranic verse] 
  The just person is one who does not confuse religion with 
ideology, but knows the scope of religion and the place for 
ideology. He does not place his belief in an organization, 
party, or group. He is not denying his own religious beliefs 
when he claims that an organization is not religious, or when he 
denies that religion is confined to a party or welded into a 
group. In fact, he would be a moderate capable of telling the 
difference between ideology and religion. He would be 
dedicating himself to his belief in God, and would work hard to 
spread his belief through his noble personality, good manners, 
harmony, and ability at reconciliation. These are qualities that 
start with the individual, and then spread to the family, the 
society, humanity, and the whole globe. He would thus be the 
person who through his creation wants to shape the world, and 
allow humanity to progress and the world to prosper.

  [Text] Tripoli/ al-Rabia'a 29 [29 March] / Jamahiriya News 
Agency -- The British Government has rejected the Arab League's 
resolution concerning the trial of Libyan suspects in the 
(?Lockerbie) incident, with the League totally rejecting a 
(?trial) if it is to be held in the United States or (?Britain). 
  The Jamahiriya News Agency's international affairs editor 
commented on this saying that the decision made by the British 
Government exposes the true intention [word indistinct] the 
British Government to escalate it with the aim of carrying out 
an aggressive act against Libya and to inflict damage on its 
interests. This is [word indistinct] and parcel of previous 
(?attacks) carried out against Libya without regard for 
international law, without regard for the truth and without 
respect for the mediation which was undertaken by several 
countries. They also have no consideration for the ease with 
which the Great Jamahiriyah responded as well as the practical 
initiatives which are sufficient for reaching the truth and 
solving the problem from the very core. However, the three 
Western allies decided to ignore these and failed to reconsider 
their stance. 
  The important thing to do now is to develop the Arab 
position 
with the aim of having the embargo on the Great Jamahiriyah 
lifted through the channels of their compatriots in the Arab 
League, firstly and secondly through the Islamic Conference.

  [Text] A Chadian ministerial delegation has arrived in the 
Libyan capital Tripoli to discuss Libya's withdrawal from the 
Aouzou Strip. As the delegation arrived, the Libyan press was 
calling on Chad to reconsider its relations with Paris. It has 
appealed to Ndjamena to cut its ties with France. The interest 
of the Chadian people, writes the Tripoli daily, AL-SHAMS, is to 
prevent the return of the colonialists in order to consolidate 
its relations with neighboring states. These comments 
undoubtedly reflect an official viewpoint. The same tone can 
be found in the columns of the daily AL-JAMAHIRIYAH, where 
France's involvement in Chad is described as harmful. 
  These anti-French attacks come at a time when Ndjamena is 
trying to obtain Libya's withdrawal from the Aouzou Strip. 
After the failure of initial contacts in Ndjamena on 17 March, 
Chad threatened to refer the dispute to the United Nations 
Security Council in order to force Libya to respect the verdict 
of the International Court in The Hague, which recognizes Chad's 
claim to the Aouzou Strip. 
  In this context, Libya's attacks against France look like a 
maneuver aimed at delaying its withdrawal from the Aouzou Strip. 
Moreover, Tripoli has had a grudge against France ever since 
France blamed Libyans for the bomb attack which downed a UTA 
plane in 1989. On the basis of a military accord with Chad, 
France has a military presence in Chad with the Epervier 
operation, which is not of course to Libya's liking.

  [Text] Tripoli, [date indistinct] Mar--JANA's African 
affairs editor has warned against the French collusive plan 
toward Chad's brotherly people. 
  He stressed that France, which was still dealing with Chad 
and African countries with a colonialist mentality, has not 
given up its desires in the African continent. France's 
dealings with Chad have always been within this framework. It 
was France that conspired against the Frolinat revolution. It 
toppled the former president Felix Malloum, conspired against 
Goukouni Oueddei and overthrew him, and is now conspiring 
against President Idriss Deby because it does not want this 
brotherly country to ever enjoy stability so that France can 
continue serving its interests in dominating and colonializing 
Chad. 
  The JANA African affairs editor said: We are confident that 
the Chadian people, who suffered from French colonialism's 
calamities and persistent conspiracies to hinder the 
establishment of stability and security in Chad, are well aware 
of what France is contriving against them and will not give 
colonialism the opportunity to come back to the region again.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Both India and Pakistan claimed victory 
after the deliberations at the Geneva-based UN Human Rights 
Commission on the Pakistani resolution on human rights 
violations in Kashmir. 
  Pakistan withdrew the resolution hours before it was due for 
a vote on 9 March after high-level contacts between Pakistan, 
China and Iran and an appeal by the delegates of developing 
countries for its withdrawal. While Indian officials were 
euphoric in claiming "stunning diplomatic victory" for the 
"unconditional withdrawal" of the resolution, which they say has 
now "lapsed," Pakistani officials were adamant that the 
resolution has only been "deferred" after what it described as 
"singular diplomatic victory" after India came under 
international pressure to allow a fact-finding delegation from 
Muslim countries to visit Kashmir. 
  While the Indian press was near unanimous in hailing the 
outcome as vindication of the Indian position that the Kashmir 
issue could only be solved bilaterally, and in predicting 
increasing domestic political pressure on Bhutto for her "Geneva 
rebuff", reaction from Pakistani media was mixed, with some 
papers even going to the extent of describing it as a "loss of 
face" for Pakistan. 
  Within hours of the Geneva vote, Delhi All India Radio in 
English at 0245 GMT on 10 March described it in its news 
bulletin as "vindication of India's principled stand" and 
broadcast a statement by External Affairs Minister Dinesh Singh. 
Singh thanked China and Iran for "prevailing upon Pakistan to 
withdraw the resolution." He also expressed the hope that 
"Pakistan will now be ready for bilateral talks under the Simla 
Agreement and desist from misleading the international community 
through false allegations of violations of human rights in 
India." 
  A radio commentary that morning urged Pakistan to "accept 
defeat." The commentary said: "Will Pakistan learn a lesson 
from the humiliation it suffered in Geneva? The outcome of the 
conference shows that while rhetoric as resorted to by the 
Pakistan prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, may sound fine, it 
does not yield results. India believes in peaceful coexistence 
with its neighbors and has consistently reiterated its 
commitment to bilateral dialogue. Hopefully, Pakistan -- having 
traversed the path of defeat -- will now realize that there is 
no substitute for peace, truth and honesty." 
  In its prime-time 1530 GMT news bulletin on 10 March, Delhi 
Radio broadcast Foreign Secretary Srinivasan's statement. The 
statement affirmed that "Pakistan's withdrawal of the resolution 
is unconditional and there is no question of linking it with 
sending of a fact-finding mission to Kashmir." At the same 
time, Srinivasan ruled out Iranian mediation on Kashmir. 
  In its 1230 GMT and 1530 GMT bulletins on 10 March, Delhi 
Radio reported the reaction of Indian political parties. The 
ruling Congress-I Party described the development as "a 
diplomatic success for India as Pakistan found itself totally 
isolated in the international community." The statement added: 
"The clear message to Pakistan from Geneva is that it must go 
back to the Simla pact." The Communist Party of India hoped 
"good sense will prevail on the Pakistan Government now that it 
has withdrawn its resolution at the UN Commission on Human 
Rights at Geneva. Pakistan should make an honest effort to 
solve it within the framework of the Simla Agreement." The 
opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, while hailing the outcome, 
urged the government "to take firm action to curb the militancy 
in Kashmir." BJP leader Atal Behari Vajpayee wanted 
"consolidation of the gains of Geneva vote by taking concrete 
steps to restore normalcy in the Kashmir valley." The Communist 
Party of India-Marxist, while expressing satisfaction, called on 
the government "to find a political solution of the Kashmir 
issue." 
  The Indian press was unanimous in praising what it described 
as Pakistan's "failure" and the "rebuff" it received. It also 
contended that the Geneva failure may create domestic political 
pressure for Benazir Bhutto. The anti-establishment INDIAN 
EXPRESS said in the editorial "Returns From a Hard Line" on 11 
March: "Islamabad is trying hard to cover up its debacle at the 
UN Human Rights Commission session by claiming that its purpose 
of internationalizing the Kashmir issue has been amply served. 
Why does it imagine that the chancelleries around the world are 
not already fully aware of the Kashmir dispute after three 
full-scale wars and four years of low intensity proxy conflict? 
In point of fact, the ridiculous strategy of internationalizing 
Kashmir has more to do with internal pressures of successive 
Pakistani regimes than with gaining external support. This is 
why Benazir Bhutto may well face the most daunting domestic 
challenge of her career following the Pakistani misadventure in 
Geneva." 
  An article by HINDUSTAN TIMES columnist M.K. Dhar said: "The 
rebuff Pakistan suffered at Geneva, where its concerted efforts 
to internationalize the Kashmir issue failed miserably, deals a 
severe diplomatic and political blow to Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto whose anti-India rhetoric is expected to become more 
strident in the coming weeks. Having queered the pitch for a 
showdown with India and having forced to retreat under the 
impact of adverse international opinion, she has made herself 
vulnerable to a renewed attack by her political adversaries. 
She will find her position further weakened, precariously 
poised as she is as the head of an inherently unstable 
government." 
  The first Pakistani report came in an Islamabad Radio 
Pakistan Network Urdu news bulletin at 0200 GMT on 10 March. 
While announcing the "deferment" of a vote after India agreed 
to allow Muslim fact-finders to visit Kashmir, the report said: 
"A three-point package has been worked out out after high-level 
contacts among Pakistan, Iran and China. Sixteen countries 
supported the formula." The same news bulletin included Foreign 
Minister Sardar Asif Ali's statement saying: "Pakistan has 
achieved its objective to awaken world opinion about the plight 
of the Kashmiri people. Despite the deferment of the 
resolution, the Kashmir issue will be raised at other world 
forums." 
  The 1100 GMT bulletin that day included Information Minister 
Khalid Ahmad Khan Kharal's statement echoing the foreign 
minister's remarks. Kharal said: "Pakistan has not withdrawn 
the resolution, but it has only been deferred at the 
intervention of its Chinese and Iranian friends." In its 
prime-time 1400 GMT bulletin, Pakistan Television in English 
broadcast a recorded statement by Foreign Minister Sardar Asif 
Ali defending Pakistan's decision to withdraw the resolution. 
The statement said: "The package deal is that a resolution has 
been tabled. It has not been withdrawn. It remains in its 
original form without any amendment whatsoever, but it has been 
deferred. So, the Kashmir resolution is now on the world 
agenda." In its 1500 GMT Urdu bulletin on 10 March, Islamabad 
Radio referred to Foreign Secretary Sharharyar Khan's statement 
that India should include the Islamic Conference Organization 
secretary general in the Muslim delegation allowed to visit 
Kashmir under the package deal. 
  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's reaction was reported by 
Islamabad Radio at 0100 GMT on 13 March. Bhutto told foreign 
correspondents in Islamabad that "Pakistan will now consider 
presenting a resolution on the issue at the United Nations." On 
the Geneva vote, Bhutto said: "India had promised us through 
Iran that it would allow the ambassadors of Islamic countries to 
visit occupied Kashmir. Fourteen countries expressed concern 
over the people of Jammu and Kashmir and violation of human 
rights when the voting on the resolution was deferred." In its 
1400 GMT English bulletin on 16 March, Pakistan Television 
referred to Bhutto's interview with Voice of Germany Radio 
defending the Pakistani decision to withdraw the resolution. 
She said: "Voting on the resolution was not important as it is 
not a game of numbers, rather it is a matter of conscience." 
  State-run media gave scant coverage to reaction by 
opposition 
parties not satisfied with the government's explanation. At 
0200 GMT on 11 March Islamabad Radio broadcast an under-minute 
report saying that Nawabzada Nasrulla Khan, chairman of the 
National Assembly Kashmir Committee, was "not happy with the 
deferment of the voting on the resolution on Kashmir at the 
Human Rights Commission in Geneva." The radio said main 
opposition leaders Mohammad Nawaz Sharif and Maulana Mohammad 
Ajmal Khan have also "criticized the deferment of the voting on 
the Pakistan resolution on Kashmir." 
  The press, however, widely published opposition criticism. 
Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz Group leader Chaudhary Shujat 
Hussain described Geneva as a "fiasco" and said "it is a black 
day in the struggle of Kashmiri people, who are rendering 
unprecedented sacrifices for their rights and have been stabbed 
by an unpopular government." Gauhar Ayub Khan, deputy 
opposition leader in the National Assembly, was more critical, 
saying "the prime minister should immediately step down as she 
had brought an embarrassment to Pakistan, which had no parallel 
in the history of the country." He added the negative vote 
outcome was due to the "criminal negligence on the part of the 
government." Mian Shahbaz Sharif, opposition leader in Punjab, 
condemned the government decision and accused Bhutto of 
"patronizing" India. He said: "She is not prepared to lose any 
single opportunity to please India by playing with the national 
interests of Pakistan, which are in no way dear to her." He 
appealed to the people to stand up against the "pro-India" 
government. 
  Editorial reaction was mixed. The pro-government THE 
PAKISTAN TIMES said in the 11 March editorial "A Successful 
Move" that "Pakistan has achieved the basic objectives 
underlying the move" to table the resolution in Geneva. 
Insisting that Pakistan has succeeded in highlighting the 
Kashmir situation for the world, it claimed: "Thus, while on the 
one hand Pakistan has succeeded in putting India on the 
defensive on the human rights issue in held Kashmir, on the 
other, it retains the diplomatic initiative in the matter." The 
Urdu-language Rawalpindi daily JANG published an editorial on 11 
March supporting the government move in wake of "pressures from 
China, Iran and 15 other friendly countries" by saying: "the 
foreign minister's assertion that by tabling the resolution 
Pakistan has realized many of its objectives is correct to a 
great extent." 
  The English-language daily THE NATION, however, took a 
different view. In the 11 March editorial "Loss of Face in 
Geneva" it said: "Whether it was an outright foreign policy 
debacle, as the Opposition would insist, or a tactical retreat 
dictated by the compulsion of circumstances as is likely to be 
offered as an alibi by the Foreign Office, Islamabad, to say the 
least, has been guilty of gross miscalculation in Geneva. And, 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be made accountable for 
misleading the government and the people about the success of 
our campaign to win the international support." The paper 
added: "whether we like it or not, New Delhi has scored a major 
propaganda victory." 
  The Rawalpindi Urdu-language daily NAWAI-I-WAQT said in a 17 
March editorial said "This indicates the weakness of the 
government's foreign policy. The withdrawal of the Pakistani 
resolution at a time when the United States, United Kingdom and 
most other countries of the world are acknowledging that Kashmir 
is a disputed territory, and when they are realizing that 
serious violation of human rights are being committed in 
occupied Kashmir, is quite amazing." The Islamabad 
Urdu-language daily KHABRAIN said in its 11 March editorial: 
"The decision will also affect the Kashmiri struggle negatively 
and Kashmiris will be gripped by a feeling of frustration."

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "A Pan-Arab Commitment," the 
newspaper AL-THAWRAH writes on the Arab meetings that were 
recently held in Syria, the most recent of which was the meeting 
held between President Hafiz al-Asad and Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih. The talks during this meeting dealt with the 
Arab situation and the efforts being exerted to tackle the 
situation in fraternal Yemen. 
  AL-THAWRAH stresses that Syria is actually qualified to play 
a pioneering pan-Arab role, and that it was the first to achieve 
solidarity and unity. Its Arab and international credibility 
has given it this pivotal and effective role that has attracted 
the sons of the Arab nation. 
  AL-THAWRAH reviews some of Syria's achievements and stands, 
such as the October war, its sacrifices for the sake of the 
Palestine question and Lebanon's unity, and its efforts to 
achieve unity with Egypt, Libya, Jordan, Sudan, Iraq, and 
Algeria. The paper also reminds us of Syria's pan-Arab stand at 
the Geneva summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and President 
Bill Clinton. The Arabs and the world were unanimous that 
President al-Asad negotiated on behalf of all Arabs. 
  AL-THAWRAH says: It is a stand that is committed to 
defending 
Arab rights and the Arab nation's interests, to achieving its 
unity, to settling differences among Arab brothers, to 
preventing internecine fighting and bloodshed, and to defending 
every pan-Arab achievement, such as Yemeni unity, which is an 
important step toward achieving Arab unity. Syria stands with 
the fraternal Yemeni people in their concern about safeguarding 
their unity, defending it, and protecting it from any reckless 
action or any attempt to torpedo it. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: Al-Asad's Syria has frequently warned 
against the dangers posed by Arab differences, which Israel 
seeks to create. The paper calls for assuming responsibility to 
achieve Arab unity and to adopt a unified stand, particularly in 
light of the current changes in the world. Israel is exploiting 
these changes to besiege the Arabs, increase their differences, 
and isolate them from their friends in order to force them into 
capitulation and normalization. Unity is needed to face Israel, 
especially while it abides by occupying land, annexing 
Jerusalem, building settlements, and bringing more Jewish 
settlers. 
  AL-THAWRAH also notes President Hafiz al-Asad's statement 
that Syria's policy has always been based on achieving Arab 
solidarity. In addition to this, Syria advocates unity and calls 
on others to achieve it, whether with us or with the other Arab 
states. We have always warned of the dangers posed to the Arabs 
if they do not achieve solidarity and unity. Arab solidarity is 
the cornerstone of the joint Arab action on which we build our 
subsequent steps. 
  Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Based on all of this, Damascus 
attached great importance to the Yemeni issue in order to arrive 
at a quick and practical solution to the current crisis, and to 
foil the scheme of internecine fighting and partition, taking 
into consideration that safeguarding Yemen's resources 
necessitates the establishment of a strong unified state, 
especially since Yemen enjoys an important location on the Arab 
and international map.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: Before the outset of the secret talks 
that led to Oslo agreement, Israeli officials used to call for a 
unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip without waiting for 
the results of the Washington talks. This is due to the fact 
that the lives of the Israeli occupiers in the Strip turned has 
into a nightmare as a result of extensive and effective 
Palestinian resistance operations, and the Palestinian people's 
confrontation of the occupation troops as one rank. 
  All of a sudden, the situation changed completely, for the 
secret Oslo talks have produced an agreement called the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. Then, as a result of the Palestinian 
side's commitment to halting struggle, the Palestinian people 
found themselves chased by the same Israeli troops they used to 
pursue. Thus, the number of Palestinians either killed or 
wounded begun to increase rapidly. 
  Israel has declared openly that its troops have the right to 
end terrorism and destroy terrorists. By this, it means the 
intifadah and its people. It implemented this on the ground by 
having its regular forces and the underground units began to 
fire indiscriminately on everyone. 
  In fact, Israel claimed that it was helping the Palestinian 
side, which was involved in signing the Oslo agreement, to 
restore security and stability to the occupied territories. The 
settlers also moved and conducted patrols. The killings 
escalated in a manner that raised the concern of the Palestinian 
people both inside and outside the occupied territories. Later, 
Israel perpetrated the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre that shook 
the world. It repeated this action by perpetrating the Jabaliya 
camp massacre in the Gaza Strip yesterday when the underground 
units, or the death squads, fired at a number of intifadah 
youths, killing six and wounding many others. Even the Fatah 
Hawks themselves have not escaped the Israeli escalation, for 
several of them were either killed or wounded. 
  It is clear to every Palestinian and Arab citizens, as well 
as to any international observer, that Israel used the Oslo 
agreement as a pretext to settle accounts with the Palestinian 
people. It has exploited the grave imbalance this agreement has 
created in the Palestinian and Arab arenas as a result of the 
Palestinian side's deviation from Arab consensus and the bases 
of the peace process, and its involvement in a distorted partial 
settlement. This has opened an endless labyrinth of darkness. 
The Gaza-Jericho accord has not led to Israel's withdrawal from 
Gaza or from Jericho, but to the tightening of the Zionist grip 
around the Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho. Moreover, the 
negotiations stumbled and the Israeli withdrawal seemed to be a 
very complicated and difficult process. 
  After Gaza and Jericho, where the situation is becoming 
intensely volatile and the suffering is growing, the Israelis 
dragged the Palestinian side into discussions on the security of 
the city of Hebron. The security of Ramallah, Tulkarm, Janin, 
or Nabulus will also rise in the future. Amid these divided 
talks, which are very far from the crux of the peace process and 
its bases and objectives, the Israelis have succeeded in 
distracting the world's attention from the true nature and 
contents of the conflict. The issue has changed from one of a 
people whose land was occupied and rights were usurped, into an 
issue of security, which Israel proposes to tackle by conducting 
patrols, of course under its officers command, by the Israeli 
Army and the proposed Palestinian police. 
  UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, which 
were 
adopted as a basis for the peace process, are clear and call for 
Israel's full withdrawal, and not for the establishment of a 
limited autonomy. The Madrid conference was held on clear bases 
and on the land-for-peace formula in order to achieve a just and 
comprehensive settlement on all the fronts of the conflict. 
Syria, supported by the Arabs, has always abided by the demand 
of a just and comprehensive solution and a full Israeli 
withdrawal. However, the Palestinian side's deviation from the 
bases of the meetings of Damascus, Beirut, and Amman, and from 
the agreed conditions of peace, has not only weakened the Arab 
position, but it has also brought catastrophes to the 
Palestinian people, increased Israeli intransigence, and 
involved the Palestine question in endless labyrinths. 
Certainly, Israel's massacres will not end with the holy 
Ibrahimi Mosque massacre or yesterday's massacre in the Gaza 
Strip. The Palestinian people will be exposed to further 
catastrophes and setbacks under the cover of futile negotiations 
that will bring nothing to the Palestinians, regardless of the 
names they take, other than entrenching occupation and 
usurpation. 
  Getting rid of this Israeli labyrinth cannot take place by 
going deeper into it, but by returning to the pillars of the 
just and comprehensive Arab peace, Arab unanimity, and to full 
coordination with the brothers, by abiding by the UN Security 
Council resolutions and the agreed-upon bases of the peace 
process, and by uniting the Palestinian people inside and 
outside the occupied territories.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Today, local newspapers address the barriers Israel 
places in the path of the peace process and its attempts to 
destroy its foundations by the commission of further massacres 
and the adoption of procrastination and maneuver. 
  AL-BA'TH writes: It has been shown to be impossible for 
Israel's policy to lead the region to the desired peace. The 
paper notes that since the positive summit session between 
Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton Israel has been 
temporizing, maneuvering, and skirting the peace process and its 
basic components. 
  Israel is bent on negating all that has been achieved in the 
interest of the peace process by fabricating incidents that 
could rekindle and destabilize the Middle East, directly 
affecting the peace process, which Israel views as being in 
conflict with its short- and long-term objectives. Israel 
objects to the terms of a just and comprehensive peace laid out 
in the UN resolutions as preconditions for any settlement. 
Israel's conduct inside occupied Palestinian territory and in 
Lebanon is designed to rekindle Lebanon, camouflage its crimes 
in the occupied territories, and derail the peace process. 
While Israel professes to be concerned about peace, it is 
carrying out a policy aimed at killing every chance for peace 
and implementing its game plan of promoting a greater Israel, 
through massacres in the occupied land and attempts to reignite 
Lebanon. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes: Working for a just and comprehensive 
peace necessarily means creating the right climate in the 
region. Had Israel been concerned about the peace process, it 
would have at least committed itself to the implementation of 
the UN resolutions. Tel Aviv, is however, not serious about 
peace. Its attention is focused on sabotaging the peace process. 
  Discussing the same theme, AL-THAWRAH writes: Since the 
Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, the heavy hand of Israel's terror has 
been felt throughout the Palestinian arena, and has been 
escalating systematically. AL-THAWRAH points to the deliberate 
killings committed by Israel on a daily basis. Blind and savage 
Zionist hatred has extended to Lebanon to assassinate the peace 
march, stability, and national unity, and sap the country's 
strength so as to make it easier to dictate its terms. There 
has been an international condemnation of Israeli aggressiveness 
and crimes and anti-peace policies. Yet, instead of 
international efforts being directed at forcing the Israeli 
rulers to comply with UN resolutions, pressure is being applied 
to victimized Arabs -- the only pary commited to peace. 
  It is important, AL-THAWRAH concludes, to reiterate that 
double standards cannot help the peace process. 
  TISHRIN, discussing the Jabalyah refugee camp massacre in 
Gaza, which claimed the lives of six Fatah hawks at the hands of 
Israel's secret units -- death squads disguised in civilian 
clothes -- writes: The new Israeli massacre was committed in 
the context of atrocities planned to browbeat the Palestinian 
people, quell their intifadah, and push them into unconditional 
capitulation. For Israel there is nothing to choose between one 
Palestinian and another; in its eyes all of them, including 
pregnant women and sucklings, are enemies. 
  The escalation against the Palestinians began after the 
signing of the Oslo agreement and since the Palestinian side 
deepened its involvement in the talks to put that accord in 
place. Before they began the secret talks with the Palestinians 
in Oslo, the Israelis threatened to effect a unilateral 
withdrawal from the Gaza strip, after their presence there had 
become a veritable inferno. But once the accord was signed, they 
adopted the tactic of temporization, withdrawing neither from 
Gaza nor from Jericho. And they are not planning any pullout. 
They saw in the Oslo agreement and its aftermath a pretext to 
escalate their criminal actions against the Palestinian people. 
  The Israeli-Palestinian negotiations are far from addressing 
the substance of the Palestinian cause, the Arab-Israeli 
conflict, the UN Security Council resolutions, the Madrid 
formula, or the peace requirements. The Palestinian side is 
yielding fresh ground at each negotiating round. What all 
parties should seek is a just and comprehensive peace on all 
fronts of the conflict. Faced with mounting Palestinian 
resistance and a united Palestinian front, Israel contemplated a 
withdrawal from Gaza before the Oslo agreement. Today, however, 
is does not seem to be in any rush. Israel sees in the split in 
the Palestinian people's ranks and the continued involvement of 
the Palestinian side in the self-rule negotiations a golden 
opportunity for settling scores with the entire Palestinian 
community. 
  Unless the Palestinian side rectifies its position by 
returning to full coordination with the other Arab parties and 
the components of a just and comprehensive peace on all fronts, 
it will be the Palestinian cause that will suffer.

<F P=106> [Report by the political editor] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] According to available 
information that is still incomplete, the network that carried 
out the church bombing is made up of three rings: 
  1. The first is the planning ring, which is Israel. The 
information indicates that two Israeli officers visited Lebanon 
for this purpose. 
  2. The second is the implementation one. Several employees 
of the Lebanese Forces' [LF] security apparatus were involved, 
including some who lived in Lebanon and some who were travelling 
and were persuaded to return. Several meetings took place 
between those who planned and those who supervised the 
implementation. Some of these meetings took place in Israel, 
some in Cyprus, and a few in Lebanon. 
  Some of those who lived abroad returned to Lebanon by sea 
from Cyprus with Israeli help involving the Israeli Navy, rubber 
dinghies, and frogmen. 
  3. The third is the protection and concealment one. This 
ring was asked to carry out a number of distraction operations 
to conceal the effects of the first crime and preoccupy the 
people with other imaginary or genuine operations. 
  The rings operated independently of each other. They only 
knew the Israeli liaison officers. 
  After the operation, most members of the implementation team 
were withdrawn by sea or infiltrated to the border strip with 
forged identity cards or foreign passports issued for this 
purpose. The members of the protection ring were also scheduled 
to be withdrawn. 
  How was the network uncovered? 
  There is no sufficient information on this subject. But what 
is certain is that the security services went back to its rich 
archives about explosive experts (these people have records and 
are identified by bombs, shells, timers, and the way the bombs 
are connected). The security services also benefited from the 
treasure they confiscated in the Lebanese Forces' war council 
when they seized the building and evicted Dr. Samir Ja'ja' to 
where he now lives in Ghidras. In this treasure there was 
abundant information about the people, networks, liaison 
officers, and explosive experts who received excellent training 
in Israel. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Why Fu'ad Malik Was Arrested </H5>
  According to the information, retired Major Fu'ad Malik, who 
is the second in command of the Lebanese Forces after Ja'ja', 
had attended some of the preparatory meetings to plan the church 
bombing. He was cited as saying to the young men in one of 
these meetings, "May God give you health." By virtue of his 
responsibility and military position, he must have been 
involved, even if he did not give the order. 
  According to the information, during his interrogation he 
said: "I am not bloody like Samir Ja'ja', and in all my time in 
the Lebanese Forces I have not killed anyone..." [passage 
omitted] 
  His arrest, according to this information, might have been 
for the purpose of exposing Ja'ja's role. It also might have 
been the result of a political settlement involving intensive 
U.S. efforts to save the head of the Lebanese Forces' commander 
and satisfy some sectarian sensitivities. 
  It is also said that U.S. Embassy officials in Beirut were 
briefed about the investigation and were stunned by the accurate 
information (and perhaps also the confessions). Consequently,

  [Text] We have been informed that at 1320, Israel raided 
the Iqlim al-Tuffah heights. Israeli warplanes are now 
releasing thermal balloons. After 1300, residential areas in 
'Arab Salim started coming under heavy sniper fire from the 
occupation troops' posts in al-Suwayda'. Israeli warplanes 
continue to overfly al-Nabatiyah and Iqlim al-Tuffah, drawing 
ground fire. Since 1200, Israeli warplanes have been flying 
over al-Nabatiyah and Iqlim al- Tuffah and conducting mock 
raids. They drew antiaircraft fire from the Lebanese Army's 
ground defenses. 
  [In a related report, Paris AFP in English at 1038 GMT on 30 
March adds the following: "Two Israeli warplanes blasted 
positions of the pro-Iranian Hizballah movement in south Lebanon 
in two successive waves on Wednesday, police here said. 
  ["The warplanes fired two missiles at positions in the Iqlim 
al- Tuffah hills east of the port city of Sidon, where Hizballah 
maintains strongholds dug in the rock."]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Fadlallah: U.S. Decision Behind </F>
al-Nabatiyah Massacre; Israelis Will Drink From Same Cup"] 
  [Text] Beirut, AL-HAYAH -- Scholar Muhammad Husayn 
Fadlallah has said that "there is a U.S.-Western terrorism 
working to kill us daily in Lebanon and Palestine with U.S. 
weapons." He also said that "a U.S. decision and U.S. brutality 
are behind the massacre committed by Israel against our people 
in the south." He said that "those killing our kinfolk and 
cities will drink from the same cup and will suffer the effects 
of this experience, because it is not that we like to kill 
children, women, and the elderly, as they did, but because we 
could reach these results when the tragedy develops into more 
than one people's revolution and more than one state of 
bereavement." 
  He added: "We understand that a war might move to stir up a 
problem with troops here and there, and we understand that some 
civilians can be killed when there is a state of war, but we 
cannot -- in the context of any political, religious, or 
cultural position -- understand why civilians, in particular 
children returning from schools, should be bombarded with a 
brutal mentality that can aim its shells against people working 
in their schools, markets, and homes, especially in areas where 
there are no military personnel or posts at all." 
  He said: "That illegitimate state is a state of massacres 
that murders children, women, and the elderly; blows up hotels, 
churches, and mosques; and kills Muslim and Christian worshipers 
in cold blood." Fadlallah wondered: "If the children killed 
while returning from their schools and the innocent people 
killed while at their homes or on their way to work were Jews, 
would the United States have kept silent? Would Europe have 
kept silent? Would that world, which calls itself civilized and 
developed, have kept silent? Or would it have instigated the 
entire world against what it terms extremists, fanatics, and 
savages.... We have not heard a single word from the arrogant 
world or an official word from Lebanon. Are they all frightened 
to condemn Israel?... [It seems that] what is required is for 
everyone to give Israel everything in order to risk the peace, 
as U.S. President (Bill Clinton) says." 
  He said: "When we look at all this spite and all these 
missiles launched against civilians, we see the U.S. decision, 
U.S. brutality, U.S. terrorism, and U.S. arrogance, joined from 
time to time by British and French arrogance." Addressing 
citizens, he said: "Store all this inside you and teach your 
children that the United States is the cause of all your 
problems, as it is the one which gives the enemy all the means 
of power and obstructs any condemnation of him." He added: "It 
is the mujahidin who represent Lebanon's strength and freedom, 
not those who engage in internal sectarian predicaments and 
massacres."

  [Text] In his Friday sermon at Imam al-Rida Mosque in

  [Text] Beirut, March 28 (AFP)--Several mass circulation 
newspapers Monday accused the government of stifling freedom of 
expression in Lebanon after it banned news programs on private 
radio and television stations. 
  The criticism came as authorities prepared to take legal 
action against two newspapers for reports on the investigation 
into the bombing of a Maronite Christian church and allegations 
that a leading suspect was beaten up in custody. 
  Ten people were killed and 54 wounded when a bomb exploded 
in 
the Our Lady of Deliverance Church in Zuq Mika'il, north of 
Beirut, on February 27. 
  "In five days a party was dissolved, radios and televisions 
were silenced and (now) they are after newspapers," said the 
pro-Syrian AL-DIYAR daily on Monday. 
  "Is the government of Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri trying 
to transform the country into a big jail?," asked the daily's 
political commentator. 
  Newspaper publisher and Lebanon's former ambassador to the 
United Nations Ghassan Tuwayni blasted Information Minister 
Michel Samahah describing him as a "little Goebbels." 
  "We fear the country will become a third world dictatorship 
with tribunals like those of the 1930s under Stalin," said 
Tuwayni in a front-page editorial in his Arabic-language daily 
AL-NAHAR. 
  Tuwayni, who up until now supported al-Hariri's government, 
called for a cabinet reshuffle. 
  Authorities last week charged that seven out of nine 
suspects 
in the bombing were members of the disbanded Christian Lebanese 
Forces militia. 
  The group, which became a political party in 1991, was 
outlawed after its deputy leader Fu'ad Malik, was arrested as 
part of the inquiry. 
  The cabinet also banned private radio and television 
stations 
from broadcasting news and political programs from midnight 
Wednesday until parliament approved legislation to regulate the 
media. The ban restricted news coverage to the state-run Tele 
Liban and Radio Liban. 
  The state-run National News Agency (ANI) said the state 
prosecutor would take action Monday against AL-DIYAR over a 
report alleging that Malik was beaten while under arrest. 
  Action would also be taken against the pro-Syrian newspaper 
AL- SAFIR which alleged the Israeli Shin Beth internal security 
service had "planned the attack on the church," according to ANI. 
  ANI said legal officials had "warned against any violation 
of 
the secrecy surrounding the investigation and maintain they will 
take action against anyone publishing information without 
official proof."

<F P=106> [Report by Hala Boncompagni] </F>
  [Text] Beirut, March 30 (AFP)--Politicians and newspapers 
voiced fears on Wednesday that Lebanon's week-old ban on 
unofficial news broadcasts could turn into a long-term blackout, 
after the government delayed a new media law. 
  A special ministerial committee is to discuss ways of 
modifying a draft law, Information Minister Michel Samahah said 
at the end of an emergency cabinet meeting on Tuesday. 
  But Beirut newspapers expected the discussions to be drawn 
out, noting that the draft law had already been shelved for more 
than two years. 
  The new law "will never authorise private media to broadcast 
news but instead invite them to collaborate with the official 
radio and television," the pro-Syrian daily AL-SAFIR. 
  "A majority of cabinet ministers support a definitive ban on 
private radio and televisions, which were born of the war and 
must end with the end of the war," it said. 
  Private radio and television stations have been banned from 
broadcasting news and political programmes since March 23. The 
government has restricted all news coverage to state-run Tele 
Liban and Radio Liban. 
  The move came as the authorities launched an investigation 
into a church bombing last month that killed 10 worshippers and 
wounded 54 others. 
  The authorities accuse seven members of the Lebanese Forces 
(LF) Christian militia of involvement in the attack. They have 
arrested the group's deputy Fu'ad Malik and outlawed the LF, 
which formed a political party in 1991. 
  The move against the LF, one of the militias widely held 
responsible for much of the bloodshed and destruction in 
Lebanon's 1975-1990 war, has divided public opinion. 
  But the ban on broadcasts has led several political and 
religious leaders as well as ordinary people to express fears it 
could mean an end to Lebanon's political freedoms, although the 
government insists it's only temporary. 
  Former MP Butrus Harb charged that the ban was shifting 
Lebanon "from a democracy to a totalitarian regime." 
  The leader of the Iranian-backed Hizballah movement, Shaykh 
Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, warned that "the turn of the print 
media will come, and Lebanon will become like all Arab 
countries, colourless and insipid." 
  Right-wing Christian Phalange Party leader George Sa'adah 
joined in to say that "a distinction must be made between 
security problems and freedom of opinion." 
  State-run Tele Liban, meanwhile, started Wednesday to 
broadcast hourly news bulletins for the first time since its 
creation in 1959 to fill the news vacuum in the country. 
  Official Radio Liban, which is picked up on medium wave in 
the Greater Beirut area only, also began broadcasting news on 
its FM channel to cover the entire country. 
  Around 50 private radio and television stations sprouted up 
during the war, most of them illegally. 
  The ban affects around 20 stations which broadcast daily 
news 
and political programmes, including Future Television which is 
owned by billionaire Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri.

  [Text] Beirut, March 29 (AFP) -- The right-wing Christian 
Phalangist Party on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against its former 
militia the Lebanese Forces (LF), in a fresh challenge to the 
outlawed faction. 
  Phalangist Secretary General Karim Paqraduni told AFP that 
the party wanted to recover the Lebanese Broadcasting 
Corporation (LBC), Lebanon's most watched television station 
which has been run by the militia since 1985. 
  He said that the LBC was set up in 1980 with Phalangist 
funds 
after a political decision was taken by the rightwing party. It 
began broadcasting five years later. 
  "The dissolution of the LF has opened the way for us to 
recover what rightfully belongs to us," he said. 
  Paqraduni added that the party had already filed lawsuits 
against the LF to retrieve cooperatives and buildings controlled 
by the former militia. 
  Last week the government outlawed the Lebanese Forces as 
part 
of an investigation into the bombing in February of a Maronite 
Christian church that killed 10 worshippers and wounded 54. 
  The authorities charge that seven out of nine suspects are 
LF 
members, including the former militia's deputy Fu'ad Malik. 
  The LF was set up in 1976 by assassinated president elect 
Bashir al-Jumayyil to be the military wing of the Phalangist 
Party, which was founded in 1936 by al-Jumayyil's father Pierre. 
  It grouped a string of Christian militias until the 
government disbanded the militias in 1990. One year later the 
LF formed a political party under the leadership of Christian 
warlord Samir Ja'ja'.

Palace on 29 March--recorded] 
  [Text] This evening, the Cabinet held an extraordinary 
meeting chaired by the president and attended by the prime 
minister and other ministers. The president expressed his hope 
and that of the prime minister and ministers that the Christian 
communities that will celebrate Easter on Sunday will perform 
all their religious rites -- after the heinous crime committed 
against the worshippers in Sayyidat al-Najat Church -- in an 
atmosphere of peace and security, thanks to the measures taken 
by the state to consolidate security and protect the homeland 
and citizens. He congratulated the Lebanese people in general 
and the Christian communities on Easter. 
  The Cabinet studied the draft media law in light of the 
observations of the ministerial committee entrusted to draft it. 
It also studied all the extraordinary circumstances compelling 
the Cabinet to adopt the extraordinary measures at its meeting 
held on 23 March. The Cabinet also discussed a bill on amending 
legislative Decree No. 104 amending the law on publications. 
The Cabinet asked the ministerial committee to redraft the 
media law in light of the ministers' observations. 
  Following the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Michel al-Murr, 
chairman of the ministerial committee, asked the committee to 
meet at 1100 on Thursday [31 March) to complete its work. The 
Cabinet also asked the information minister to propose to the 
next Cabinet meeting that it define the framework banning the 
radio and television networks from broadcasting direct and 
indirect political news and programs, with the exception of 
Tele-Liban and Radio Lebanon, in accordance with the Cabinet 
decision.

  [Excerpts] Amman, 29 Mar (PETRA)--[passage omitted] Dr. 
Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for cabinet affairs and 
information minister, has said the Council of Ministers reviewed 
the measures that are being taken in the port of al-'Aqabah to 
search vessels on their way to Jordan. [passage omitted] 
  He added that the council heard a report from the minister 
of 
state for foreign affairs on his participation in the Arab 
League foreign ministers meetings. He said Jordan is very eager 
that Arab meetings reflect the Arab desire and tendency to hold 
a unified position. 
  He said Jordan believes that there are problems facing the 
process of clearing Arab atmosphere and returning Arab relations 
to their previous situation, saying Jordan has an open heart to 
all Arab brothers who want to have relations with Jordan on the 
basis of fraternity and sincerity. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said the Arab League Council delayed 
discussing 
the subject of the Arab League Charter, on which there were 
several ideas presented for discussion. He said His Majesty 
King Husayn was the first to demand the reconsideration of the 
charter so that it can cope with new circumstances. 
  As for bilateral relations with Egypt, Dr. al-'Anani said 
the 
minister of state for foreign affairs met at the sidelines of 
the Arab foreign ministers meetings with Egyptian Prime Minister 
Dr. 'Atif Sidqi, and an agreement was reached to hold meetings 
of the Jordanian-Egyptian higher joint committee in the second 
half of April. The meetings had previously been delayed. 
[passage omitted] 
  Answering a question on the U.S. proposal that a barge carry 
out inspection at the port of al-'Aqabah, Dr. al-'Anani said the 
presence of a barge in the port would conflict with Jordanian 
sovereignty and that Jordan could not accept this. He said that 
there has been no such proposal at all. 
  He said what was demanded was that a neutral international 
quarter assigned by the United Nations carry out inspection of 
vessels that unload their cargoes in the port of al-'Aqabah. He 
said that Jordan rejects the presence of any military forces 
from any party because Jordan maintains its sovereignty. Had 
Jordan been willing to relinquish this sovereignty, it would 
have allowed the ships that inspect al-'Aqabah-bound vessels to 
cross into Jordanian territorial waters to reach the port and 
carry out inspections. This was the original problem that 
delayed the vessels in the past, because the government totally 
rejects this. 
  He said we accept the presence of civilian technical 
observers from a specialized neutral quarter who give 
certificates that the inspected cargoes do not contain anything 
that violates the economic sanctions.

<F P=106> [By P.V. Vivekanand, JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Excerpts] Amman--American and Jordanian officials are 
scheduled to meet in Washington Thursday [31 March] to discuss 
Jordan's demand for a solution to the negative impact on its 
economy of the de facto blockade of al-'Aqabah imposed by the 
enforcers of the 44-month-old international sanctions against 
Iraq, Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said Tuesday. 
  Addressing a press conference after a regular Council of 
Ministers meeting, Dr. al-'Anani called on the U.S. to seek a 
speedy solution to the problem so that Jordan could go back to 
the 28-month-old American-backed Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. 
  The government has been informed by the Jordanian embassy in 
Washington that a meeting has been scheduled for Thursday among 
Jordanian officials and representatives of all concerned U.S. 
government departments and agencies to discuss the issue, Dr. 
al-'Anani said. 
  "The Jordanian government urges concerned authorities in the 
U.S. and also the United Nations to speed up the proposal to 
replace offshore inspections by onshore inspections by a third 
neutral party," said Dr. al-'Anani. [passage omitted] 
  Dr. al-'Anani said Jordan did not share the view that the 
Arab-Israeli peace process and the effects of the international 
sanctions imposed against Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait 
in August 1990 were two separate issues. 
  "We believe that the issue of al-'Aqabah cannot be fully 
disassociated from the peace process," he said. "After all, the 
whole peace process was basically generated after the Gulf war. 
Therefore, to say that there is no link is not a view that is 
necessarily shared by Jordan." 
  Dr. al-'Anani said a recent escalation of the interceptions 
and inspection procedures adopted by the American-led warships 
patrolling the Red Sea could not but be seen as a form of 
indirect pressure on Jordan to accept an Israeli demand that the 
Kingdom sign a peace agreement and then negotiate the terms of 
the accord. 
  "Jordan is not going to succumb to pressures of this kind," 
the minister said. "We want the peace process to pursure a 
rational path. Jordan does not need to give any further 
evidence to its positive attitude and its important and key role 
in the peace process itself." [passage omitted] 
  Dr. al-'Anani, who estimated that Jordan lost up to $1.3 
billion in extra freight costs alone as a result of higher 
charges levied by shipowners sending their vessels to and from 
al-'Aqabah since the sanctions against Iraq were imposed in 
August 1990, noted that inspectors have not been able to find a 
single violation of the sanctions after checking more than 1,700 
vessels. 
  Despite such a record, he said, Jordan continued to suffer 
from the modalities of the inspections. The minister said the 
Kingdom reserved the right to demand compensation for the losses 
it incurred. 
  "The final effect of the method of inspections on 
Jordan-bound ships is not justified by the method of application 
of sanctions against Iraq," Dr. al-'Anani said. "Alternatives 
were offered and we think they should have been studied but that 
should not have taken so much to be finalised and approved. 
  "Therefore, when the number of ships that were intercepted 
escalated in the last month while there was a constructive 
proposal that has been discussed but not ratified, we had to 
draw a conclusion that Jordan is targeted economically and 
politically...," said Dr. al-'Anani. [passage omitted] 
  The information Minister welcomed a statement by U.S. State 
Department spokesman Michael McCurry that the Jordanian proposal 
was under study and said Jordan hoped that "this matter will be 
very very soon resolved." 
  "If that happens, then we think it would iron out a major 
problem which is not only affecting the Jordanian economy but 
also inflaming popular response to the whole situation," Dr. 
al-'Anani said. 
  The minister was referring to a call issued by Parliament 
last week for the goverment to refuse to return to peace talks 
with Israel until the siege of al-'Aqabah is lifted and the 
lifting is formally announced at the Security Council. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said the Jordanian call for an end to the 
"modus operandi" of inspecting Aqaba-bound vessels was not 
linked to the overall sanctions against Iraq although Jordan 
strongly felt that the situation of the Iraqi people was 
worsening due to lack of enough food and medicine. 
  Dr. al-'Anani also reiterated that Jordan would not accept 
the stationing of international forces in its territory since 
such a move... will be in violation of Jordan's sovereignty and 
territorial integrity." [punctuation as published] 
  Asked whether Jordan would attend an April 7 round of 
multilateral talks on the environment, which is part of the 
Middle East process, Dr. al-'Anani said: "We hope that the 
concerned parties will arrive at a speedy decision to solve the 
problem" of the siege of Aqaba.

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has 
stressed that Jordan has always backed just, comprehensive, and 
lasting peace and will continue to support it and that Jordan is 
working to establish stability in the region. 
  During his meeting with German Labor Minister Norbert Bluem 
at the Prime Ministry today, the prime minister said the 
negotiations should inevitably lead to a comprehensive and real 
peace. He added: We agreed to negotiate on the essence and not 
the form, and we agreed that the issue of security should be 
discussed with the withdrawal from the occupied territories, the 
issue of economy with that of the refugees and the displaced, 
and the issue of water with the plans on environment and energy, 
and we have announced that we are ready to discuss all these 
problems at the same time. 
  The prime minister pointed out that Jordan has endured the 
most from the Gulf war and that it has sustained a sizable loss. 
He said: I personally visited New York and explained to the 
officials there the pressure and harassment to which Jordan is 
being submitted through the blockade imposed on the port of 
al-'Aqabah and the momentous losses resulting from this 
harassment, as well as the other consequences sustained by the 
Jordanian economy, which has been unjustifiably punished. 
  Dr. al-Majali said: We hope that Germany will support 
Jordan's right to have the blockade lifted from the al-'Aqabah 
Port and help it overcome its problems by alleviating the 
tribulations of the citizens and the trade sectors as a result 
of the price hikes caused by the transportation costs and the 
blockade imposed on the port. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd- al-Salam </F>
al-Majali in Amman by Nicole Tannuri in London; date not 
given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Tannuri] A U.S. spokesman has stated that the 
United States is considering amending the procedures for 
searching ships bound for the Jordanian port of al-'Aqabah to 
curb the economic impact on Jordan resulting from the sanctions 
imposed on Iraq. Dr. al-Majali, how do explain the Jordanian 
stand? 
  [Al-Majali] The Jordanian economy has been considerably 
affected. In such an atmosphere and with that massive impact on 
conditions in Jordan, how can we go to peace negotiations? A 
negotiator must be relaxed; he must feel at ease about 
negotiating for peace because it involves benefits for all. 
  [Tannuri] The United States has said that there are 
proposals 
and ongoing negotiations about searching ships. What are these 
proposals; and is it possible for the government to respond 
positively to them? 
  [Al-Majali] First of all, I would like to affirm that we are 
hiding nothing. We are a committed state that has good 
credibility. When we say that we import nothing that violates 
the UN resolutions, we really mean that. But they have to 
conduct searches. Hence, we proposed several methods to handle 
this. One of these is to entrust the task to an international 
nonprofit firm, like Lloyd's Register. This firm's 
representatives in al-'Aqabah can monitor things and report 
directly to the United Nations. 
  More than three months have passed. We understood that the 
parties concerned had approved this proposal. Nothing has 
happened yet. On the contrary, the number of ships searched or 
intercepted this year is almost equal to all the ships searched 
in the past years. 
  [Tannuri] Are there guarantees in monitoring violations and 
ensuring Jordan's commitment not to violate the UN resolutions 
imposing the embargo on Iraq? 
  [Al-Majali] We are committed. We are a member of the United 
Nations. If we do not comply we will be violating the 
resolutions of an organization to which we belong. 
  [Tannuri] Thank you Mr. prime minister.

  [Text] Cairo, 30 Mar (MENA)--Talal al-Hasan, Jordanian 
minister of state for foreign affairs, has said that the intense 
ministerial participation in the Arab League Council's meetings 
showed sincere intentions and sound hopes for Arab solidarity. 
  In an interview with AL-AHRAM today, the minister said 
Jordan 
is eager to support the Arab League and realize the idea of 
comprehensive pan-Arab security to allow an Arab reconciliation 
and solidarity able to overcome the differences. He added that 
Jordan is also eager to forsake the past to enable the Arab 
nation to face up to its challenges and dangers. 
  He said his country will not abandon the principles of the 
peace process in which it believes, primarily Security Council 
resolutions, the principle of land for peace, Israel's 
withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories, primarily 
Jerusalem, and securing the Palestinians' legitimate rights, on 
top of which is their right to self-determination. 
  On the blockade of the port of al-'Aqabah, which Jordan 
tried 
to link with the resumption of negotiations, he said the 
blockade causes huge losses to the Jordanian economy, adding 
that it was enforced as a result of the Gulf war to which Jordan 
was not a party and for the results of which it was not 
responsible. 
  He added that Jordan presented legal documents to the United 
Nations and every country concerned and explained the need for 
and importance of lifting this blockade as a security measure to 
guarantee the region's stability and advance the peace process. 
  Commenting on recent terrorist incidents in Jordan, Talal 
al- 
Hasan said they were isolated. They are being investigated and 
the law will take its course. He noted that Jordan has always 
enjoyed stability and security.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "We Reject Encroachment on Our Sovereignty"] </F>
  [Text] The press statement issued after His Majesty King 
Husayn's met with the ambassadors of the permanent Security 
Council states was a source of deep pride for the people of 
Jordan. They see King Husayn's brave stand as a reflection of 
their deep feelings of being deceived throughout the past. 
  This is especially so since the siege imposed by the U.S. 
Navy on the Port of al-'Aqabah encroaches on what is most 
valuable for Jordan -- its dignity and its national reputation. 
The siege directly encroaches on Jordan's sovereignty, in 
addition to the economic losses it causes and the difficulties 
it produces, which add to the difficulties Jordan faces in the 
wake of the Gulf war. 
  In light of this, Jordan justly and legitimately demands the 
lifting of the unfair and unjustified siege of the only port 
linking it to the outside world. It demands that naval forces 
stationed in international waters stop dealing with Jordan as an 
outlaw country that is secretly violating international 
resolutions. 
  Hence, any measure intended to be a quick solution to the 
siege of the Port of al-'Aqabah will be rejected if it is 
conditional on the presence of U.S. barges in the Jordanian 
port. This is especially so because such a solution would be a 
blatant violation of the sovereignty of an independent country 
and a UN member that has not committed any violation that 
stipulates such punishment. 
  In return, Jordan -- which accepted the UN Security Council 
resolutions without being convinced about them and which avoided 
as much as possible appearing as a violator of international 
legitimacy resolutions that deal with the ongoing siege -- 
accepts the presence of international employees to inspect the 
goods arriving at the Port of al-'Aqabah. In other words, it 
accepts the presence of a neutral international party delegated 
by the United Nations to inspect incoming ships. 
  We believe the stand bravely expressed by His Majesty King 
Husayn reflects the feelings of every citizen in this patient 
and mobilized country. We realize at the same time that the 
siege of the Port of al-'Aqabah is an issue that goes beyond 
implementing the UN embargo on Iraq. It reaches the level of 
exercising political pressure and compelling Jordan to accept 
what it did not accept in the ongoing peace process. This 
prompts us to stand together in support of King Husayn's stand 
to reject every encroachment on our sovereignty and national 
dignity.

<F P=106> [By P.V. Vivekanand, JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] Amman--A senior Palestine Liberation Organisation 
(PLO) official on Tuesday [29 March] briefed Jordanian officials 
on the status of the PLO's negotiations with Israel on security 
arrangements for Palestinians in the occupied territories 
following the Feb. 25 massacre in Hebron and said afterwards 
there were no differences between Jordan and the organisation. 
  Hakam Bal'awi, the PLO's representative to Tunisia, briefed 
Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali on PLO-Israeli contacts 
and related developments in the Middle East peace process 
following the adoption of U.N. Security Council Resolution 904. 
  While the resolution cleared the way for a possible 
resumption of Middle East peace talks by condemning the Hebron 
massacre and calling for international protection for the 
Palestinian people living under occupation, it also signalled a 
possible shift in the U.S. stand towards Jerusalem. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton has denied thatthere was any 
such 
shift, and senior Washington officials say that the U.S. refusal 
to endorse the Holy City's status as occupied territory stemmed 
from a desire not to prejudge the outcome of Israeli-Palestinian 
negotiations on the future of the occupied lands. 
  Jordan has criticised the PLO over the resolution saying the 
document was mishandled since it opened the door for the U.S. to 
state what could be a precedent-setting position by abstaining 
on the reference to Jerusalem as occupied territory. 
  Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani, one of the officials 
who met on Tuesday with Mr. Bal'awi, who was sent there by 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, agreed with Mr. Bal'awi that there was 
no "fundamental rift" with the PLO. 
  "In essence the difference is not a political one because 
what is demanded first and foremost is guaranteeing the Arab 
rights in Jerusalem," Dr. al-'Anani said. 
  Dr. al-'Anani told reporters that Mr. Bal'awi had brought a 
"positive approach" in the sense that he reaffirmed that 
"Jordanian- Palestinian relations are strong and should remain 
strong and should not be negatively affected by a difference 
here or a difference there." 
  Dr. al-'Anani said Jordan's foremost concern in the context 
of Jerusalem was to defend the Arab rights to the Holy City. 
"Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation should not 
differ over Jerusalem because we have a right in Jerusalem and 
we should restore them," Dr. al-'Anani said. 
  "Differences in opinion sometimes lead to exaggerated 
political implications if those differences are overread," Dr. 
al-'Anani said, emphasising the need for coordinating Jordanian 
and Palestinian stands towards Jerusalem, "an issue that 
concerns the Arabs, Jordanians, Palestinians, Muslims and 
Christians..." 
  It was clear from Mr. Bal'awi's comments to reporters after 
the meeting that the PLO was anxious to avert any dispute with 
Jordan. Jordanian-PLO differences were "something of the past" 
he said, adding "Jordanians and Palestinians share the same 
objectives and goals and we are working together to achieve 
them." 
  Mr. Bal'awi avoided direct questions on a statement issued 
by 
the PLO early this week criticising Jordan and defending the 
organisation's handling of Resolution 904 at the Security 
Council. 
  Jordan said that it was a midtake to have insisted on 
including a reference to Jerusalem in Resolution 904 after it 
became clear that Washington would abstain from voting on any 
reference to the Holy City as occupied territories. Instead, 
Jordan said, the wording of the resolution could have been 
amended to include a general reference to the territories Israel 
occupied since 1967 without mentioning Jerusalem. 
  Jordan pointed out that for all practical and technical 
purposes Washington always recognised Jerusalem as occupied 
territory and the door would not have been open for the U.S. to 
signal a shift in its stand by abstaining on a specific 
reference to Jerusalem if it was not included in the resolution. 
  But the PLO stand was that every U.N. resolution issued on 
the Middle East since 1967 included a reference to Jerusalem and 
dropping such a reference would have implied an abandoning of 
the Palestinian claim to the city as the capital of their future 
independent state. 
  Mr. Bal'awi indirectly repeated the same position on 
Tuesday, 
"Jerusalem is the capital of the independent state of 
Palestine," he told reporters. "At the same time it is also an 
issue of concern for Arabs, Muslims as well as Christians." 
  The PLO official looked visibly uncomfortable answering 
repeated questions from journalists focusing on the theme of 
Jerusalem and the restoration of holy shrines there. 
  The question of restoring holy shrines in Jerusalem was 
raised when last week's PLO statement specifically referred to 
Saudi Arabia's "contribution to repairing and maintaining" them 
but did not contain any reference to Jordan, which continues to 
be the guardian of the Muslim shrines in the Holy City despite 
its severance of legal and administrative links with the 
occupied territories in 1988. 
  Asked what the PLO's stand was towards the restoration of 
holy sites, Mr. Bal'awi skirted a direct answer and said: "Any 
development of any sites in the occupied territories is not 
different from developing any sites elsewhere in Palestine or in 
Jordan... Karak, Ma'an, Qalqiliya, Gaza or Nabulus..." 
  Answering other questions, Mr. Bal'awi said he briefed the 
Jordanian government on the status of negotiations with Israel 
"following the massacre in Hebron and the adoption of U.N. 
Security Council Resolution 904." 
  He stressed that the talks that the PLO launched with Israel 
after Resolution 904 was adopted were not a continuation of the 
negotiations on self-rule as envisaged in the Sept. 13 
Israel-PLO accord but covered only "security arrangement for the 
Palestinians living under occupation." 
  If these talks produced a satisfactory arrangement, he said, 
the PLO would resume the self-rule negotiations.

  [Text] Amman, March 29 (GNA)-- The Jordanian authorities 
have started the application of new restrictions on traveller 
crossing into Jordan through bridges with the occupied 
Palestinian territories. 
  Without any announcement, the Jordanian authorities ordered 
Palestinians to obtain an entry authorization ahead of crossing 
its territories from the occupied Arab lands. 
  The new decision, the first such measure since 1967, is only 
effective on residents of the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip who 
are 45 years old and more and those living in the occupied West 
Bank who are 36 years old and more. 
  Palestinian and Jordanian joint committees have discussed 
here lately the movement of Palestinians through bridges linking 
Jordan with the occupied territories. 
  The measures were apparently taken in light of the agreement 
reached between the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel 
in regard with the Gaza-Jericho first accord.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Amman AL-BILAD in Arabic on 30 March 
publishes on page 5 an approximately 4,000-word report on the 
suspects charged in connection with a spate of recent explosions 
in Jordan. 
  AL-BILAD, "an independent political weekly," claims to have 
accompanied Major Muhannad Hijazi, the public prosecutor of the 
State Security Court, and the defendants to the sites targeted 
for explosions. The defendants were reported to have been in 
good health. They were also reported to have said that they are 
"heroes" because they carried out these bombings. The argument 
that they advanced is that they were carrying out God's 
injunction against "debauchery." They reportedly planned to 
establish a caliphate, assassinate intelligence and army 
personnel, and kill the Jordanian and Palestinian peace talks 
teams to halt the march of "capitulation," as they put it. 
  The weekly states that 'Abdallah Kamil al-Shuraydah 
al-Hashayikah is the principal defendant in the series of 
bombings that have recently taken place in Jordan. The weekly 
notes that al-Hashayikah, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, 
Suwaylih Branch, left Amman in 1990 to work as a teacher of 
Arabic in the Philippines, where he also taught at the al-Imam 
al-Shafi'i Foundation. This foundation is supervised by Jamal 
Khalifah, also known as Abi-Bara', a Saudi national and an 
in-law of Usamah Bin-Ladin, a Saudi national of Yemeni origin 
currently living in Khartoum, Sudan. Khalifah, Bin-Ladin's 
right hand-man, is reported to be close to the ruling Saudi 
family. 
  According to the paper, al-Hashayikah discussed with 
Khalifah 
the idea of launching of an organization in Jordan to "eradicate 
forbidden conduct by force" in order to lay the groundwork for 
establishing a caliphate in Jordan. This idea was well received 
by Jamal Khalifah. The recruits of the organization would be 
Jordanians who received military training in Afghanistan during 
the war with the Soviets. The only thing the organization 
needed was financing. The report states that this all happened 
while the two were in the Philippines. Al-Hashayikah returned 
to Amman early this year to launch his organization so that he 
might receive the promised finances from Bin-Ladin, and Jamal 
Khalifah, "the mastermind of Bin-Ladin's terrorist operations in 
the Arab world." 
  The article continues, noting that the organization 
al-Hashayikah used had already taken its final shape before he 
left for the Philippines. It had a joint command consisting of 
himself, as well as Jihad al-Tanjir, Zakariyah Muhammad Dawud, 
and Isma'il al-'Amayirah. They used mosques and places of 
worship to "concoct conspiracies." The recruits of the 
organization received refresher courses in military training 
during further visits to Afghanistan via Saudi Arabia or Yemen. 
  According to the paper, "Bin-Ladin's group" received the 
recruits in Saudi Arabia upon their arrival there, and provided 
them with the necessary visas and air tickets to Pakistan, where 
they then traveled to Afghanistan. Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid 
al-Zandani, representative of the Yemeni Reform Grouping at the 
Yemeni Presidential Council, is reported to have provided the 
Afghan Arabs stopping over in Yemen en route to Afghanistan with 
the necessary visas and air tickets, as well as "his constant 
financial support for the organization." 
  The weekly also claims that some of the organization members 
remained in Jordan to plan bomb attacks and recruit other 
members. Having faced difficulties in acquiring the necessary 
explosives in Jordan, the organization sent Zakariyah Muhammad 
Dawud Qasim to Yemen, where he was trained in how to manufacture 
sophisticated explosives. He was also trained in detonating 
explosives by remote control. 
  The paper explains that, in order to achieve its objectives, 
the organization believed that it had to kill Arab and Muslim 
leaders who do not apply the Islamic sharia in their countries. 
It also believed that it had to resist the ongoing Middle East 
peace negotiations by all means, including the use of force. 
The organization also planned to blow up movie theaters, 
nightclubs, bars, tourist areas, liquor stores, and public areas 
where the two sexes mingle, such as the Housing Bank Complex. 
The organization also planned to assassinate senior 
intelligence, army, and public security personnel in order to 
pave the way for the creation of a caliphate in Jordan. 
  Noting a plan by the organization to assassinate the 
Jordanian and Palestinian peace talks negotiators, AL-BILAD 
says: "In addition to carrying out bombings, the organization 
members entertained the idea of drawing up a full-fledged plan 
to liquidate Jordanian and Palestinian peace negotiators, headed 
by Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, former head of 
the Jordanian delegation to the peace talks. 
  According to the paper, the group found al-Majali's home 
telephone number, and telephoned him, telling him they were 
journalists working for a local daily. They asked for a date 
for an important press interview with him. Al-Majali agreed to 
grant them an interview. Al-Majali was meant to be assassinated 
during this bogus interview, according to the report, which it 
said was planned with a great deal of cleverness. A date was 
set for the interview and forty-eight hours before the interview 
was scheduled to take place, the organization leadership had 
drawn up a detailed plan to assassinate al-Majali by explosive 
charges and other weapons to be carried by the bogus press team, 
which would have consisted of reporters and cameramen. 
  The paper says it was only divine providence that intervened 
to save al-Majali, who was assigned an official mission outside 
Jordan. This mission required him to travel to Washington ahead 
of the time set for the implementation of the assassination 
plan. Thus, the bogus interview date was postponed to a later 
date. However, this date has never materialized because the 
culprits were apprehended. 
  The weekly paper goes on to say that, having failed in their 
bid to liquidate al-Majali, the organization members attempted 
to assassinate members of the Palestinian delegation to the 
Middle East peace talks, including Faysal al-Husayni and Hanan 
'Ashrawi. However, stringent security precautions and the 
secrecy with which al-Husayni and 'Ashrawi surround their moves 
thwarted the defendants' scheme. Undeterred by their failure, 
the defendants recruited an employee of the Grand Palace Hotel, 
where the Palestinian peace negotiators stayed. The hotel 
employee was asked to plant explosive charges in the peace 
negotiators' rooms. Once again, strict security precautions 
thwarted their scheme. 
  According to the report, the failure of the organization's 
assassination scheme prompted the organization command to 
endorse a plan of explosions in Jordan to convince Jamal 
Khalifah to finance the organization. This resulted in 
explosions at movie theaters in Amman and al-Zarqa'. However, 
attempts to carry out further explosions elsewhere in Jordan 
failed. 
  Muhammad 'Ali Shihadah is reportedly the "organization's 
mastermind responsible for picking explosion targets." 
  The paper's investigations indicated that 'Abdallah Diyyah, 
a 
prominent Suwaylih-based Muslim Brotherhood member, was 
acquainted with the organization's scheme by 'Abdallah 
al-Hashayikah. However, Muslim Brotherhood sources ruled out 
Diyyah's involvement in this scheme. 
  Elaborating further on this issue, the paper says: "Several 
quarters insinuated that the Muslim Brotherhood could be 
implicated in these explosion incidents, particularly since 
al-Hashayikah was a Brotherhood leader in Suwaylih, not to 
mention the fact that Diyyah was close to the hawkish wing of 
the Muslim Brotherhood. Meanwhile, informed sources ruled out 
this possibility, which has not been confirmed by the 
interrogations conducted with the defendants. 
  "AL-BILAD has learned that 23 persons have been implicated 
in 
the recent spate of explosions. They will stand trial at the 
State Security Court within the next two weeks. If found 
guilty, they could receive punitive measures, including the 
death sentence. These defendants are the following: 'Abd Salih 
Husayn al-Jahalin, Muhammad 'Ali Husayn Shihadah Abu-'Ayyad, 
Yasin Hasan Muhammad Zahrah, Hasan Hamdan Hasan 'Abd-al-Qadir, 
Muhammad Salih Musa 'Aqil, Sulayman Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Al Bisah, 
Muhammad Ahmad 'Abd-al-Fattah al-'Adharibah, Samir Ahmad 
Muhammad Tilagh, 'Abd-al-Nasir Mahmud Muhammad Yunus, Fa'iq 
Salih Yusuf al-Shawish, 'Umar Jibril Muhammad al-Shawahin, 
'Abdallah Kamil al-Hashayikah, Jihad Ahmad Khalid al-Tanjir, 
Khalil Tawfiq Muhammad 'Alqam, Muhammad Ahmad al-Shaykh 
al-Fahmawi, Salim Musa Yusuf, Zakariyah Muhammad Dawud Qasim, 
Isma'il Sa'id al-'Amayirah, Muhammad Sa'id Muqbil Dar-'Awdah, 
Walid Muhammad 'Ashsha, Muhammad Amin al-Shamasinah, Ra'd 
Khalil, and 'Abd-al-Majid al-'Adharibah." 
  AL-BILAD concludes its report by promising to provide its 
readers with further details as they unfold when the State 
Security Court begins to investigate this case. 
  No further processing planned.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] Amman--The Islamic Action Front (IAF) party Tuesday 
[29 March] voiced its support for North Korea in the face of 
what it called U.S. arrogance and attempts to humiliate the 
North Korean people and tamper with their internal affairs. 
  In a letter addressed to president Kim Il-Song through the 
North Korean ambassador in Amman, the IAF denounced U.S. 
attempts to conduct inspections on North Korea's nuclear 
programme at a time when Washington continues to provide 
unlimited assistance to the Jewish state by helping it to build 
up its own nuclear arsenal. 
  The Americans continue to supply military assistance to the 
Israelis who continue to occupy Palestinian land and cause the 
dispersion of Palestinians throughout the world, said the letter. 
  American threats levelled against North Korea remind us of 
the tragedy and the sufferings of the Iraqi people who continue 
to endure the consequences of the unjust war waged on them and 
the results of the embargo on its children and women, the letter 
continued. 
  At the same time, it said, the Americans continue to pursue 
a 
policy aimed at humiliating the Iraqi people and devastating 
their potentials in order to prevent them from building for 
future generations. 
  American threats levelled against North Korea, which refuses 
to succumb to Washington's hegemony, they said, also remind them 
of Washington's threats against Sudan, whose people suffer as a 
result of an embargo imposed since the emergence of an Islamic 
regime in the country, said the letter. 
  In conjunction with the sanctions on Sudan is American 
continued support for the separatist movement in the South of 
the country a move which, the letter said, is designed to weaken 
the Sudanese people and keep them subjected and under American 
control. 
  "While we express our total astonishment at the U.S. 
administration's insistence on conducting inspections on your 
nuclear programme through the help of the U.N. Security Council, 
which has become a tool in Washington's hands, we also note that 
the United States administration protects and enhances Israel's 
nuclear programme and an arsenal of hundreds of nuclear heads 
that perpetually threaten the Arab region's security," said the 
IAF. 
  Such practices, concluded the letter, provide a stark 
evidence of the United States double standard policies.

<F P=106> ["Highlights" column by Dr. Fahd al-Fanik: "Will We Bend Our </F>
Heads to the United States?"] 
  [Text] The UN Security Council's resolution on 17 March 
1994, which maintained the blockade on the Iraqi people, was a 
U.S. decision. This resolution represented the utmost in racial 
discrimination and hostility toward the Arabs. It was a new 
U.S. stab in the back of the Arab nation and dignity, as well as 
a violation of simple human rights and Security Council 
Resolution 715, which clearly provides for the lifting of the 
oil embargo once the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass 
destruction is completed. This elimination, however, was 
achieved two months ago as was stated by the chief inspector 
Ekeus. 
  Each time Iraq meets the Security Council's demands, despite 
their arbitrary nature, the United States presents impossible 
new demands and terms. The blockade is not meant to liberate 
Kuwait, dispose of Iraq's nuclear capabilities, or eliminate 
weapons of mass destruction; it is meant to subjugate Iraq to 
the United States. 
  U.S. sources say that 397,226 Iraqis died as a direct result 
of the blockade from 1990 to the end of 1993. This figure 
includes 140,181 children under five years of age. This is a 
true massacre and "a holocaust" committed against the Arab race. 
  The world is still feeling guilty due to its silence over 
the 
racist Nazi crimes, but, the world's conscience is still asleep 
despite the continuous massacre against Iraq's children, old 
people, and patients. 
  There are other significant statistics to measure the 
repercussions resulting from the crime of this age. Iraqi 
medical laboratories issued 1,494,050 reports in 1989. This 
figure declined by 27 percent in 1990; by 57 percent in 1991; by 
60.5 percent in 1992; and by 61.4 percent in 1993. Due to the 
lack of necessary medical supplies, surgeries carried out in 
Iraqi hospitals declined by 43 percent in 1990; by 57 percent in 
1991; by 63.7 percent in 1992; and by 65.6 percent in 1993. 
Moreover, diseases caused by malnutrition have risen 13.6-fold 
since the blockade began. 
  The real pleasure for those in the U.S. Administration, who 
pursue the hobby of torturing and annihilating human beings, is 
to compel the Arabs and Muslims to join the blockade. This is a 
unique way of coercion and humiliation under the slogan of 
international legitimacy. 
  The United States committed a bloody massacre in Iraq in 
1991 
using the most sophisticated lethal weapons under the Republican 
George Bush. Today, the United States is committing another, 
yet more atrocious massacre, under the Democrat President 
Clinton, represented by denying an entire people their natural 
rights to obtain food and medicine. This constitutes an open 
call for terrorism, bigotry, wrath, and extremism in the Middle 
East. 
  The humiliating Arab submission to the unfair U.S. blockade 
on the Arab people in Iraq means that the Arabs are bending 
their heads to the neo-Nazis who describe the wars of 
annihilating peoples as a conflict among civilizations.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Siege of Iraq and Boycott of Enemy"] </F>
  [Text] It is an economic disaster even to think of lifting 
or easing the Arab boycott of the Zionist enemy, and it is an 
economic and political disaster to include this topic in the 
Arab foreign ministers meetings less than 40 days since the 
martyrdom of scores of Palestinians in the Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  It will be an economic, political, and moral disaster if 
these ministers meet to discuss lifting the Arab boycott without 
daring to discuss the racialist Arab, Islamic, and Western 
boycott of sisterly Iraq and the war of annihilation launched 
against its people, their bread, medicines, and security. 
  How did things get so bad? How did the U.S. and Western 
disdain for the nation reach the point of asking it to lift the 
boycott on the enemy and tighten it on a sisterly country? How 
do the Arab League states meet in Cairo without remembering the 
tragedy of the Iraqis who, thanks to this league and under its 
pan-Arab flag, the first instigative resolution against them was 
adopted without hearing the voice of the honorable Arabs which 
warned that this resolution was against the whole nation and 
targeted the nation's dignity, wealth, present, and future. 
  We were pleased with the reference to the continued Western 
pressures on Libya, but we wonder why no reference was made to 
the Western war of annihilation launched against the Iraqi 
people? 
  We were pleased with the reference to the Libyan flexibility 
in dealing with the Western pressures, but we wonder why no 
reference was made to all obligations fulfilled by sisterly Iraq 
and the flexibility it showed, which did not convince the 
brother rather than the enemy, and did not convince the friend 
rather than the foe? 
  What we hope to see is something concrete to show respect 
for 
the blood of Ramadan's martyrs in the Ibrahimi Mosque, and a 
conviction by all that the Iraqis, Palestinians, Libyans, 
Sudanese, Somalis, and all other Arabs are Arabs who should be 
treated with the same standards -- that is if we have the free 
will to do this and can make an independent decision. 
  What we hope is that some people would be ashamed before 
God, 
homeland, nation, and history when we hear talk about lifting 
the boycott on the enemy and do not hear whispers about lifting 
the boycott on the brother, although hundreds of Iraqis are 
martyred by famine, disease, and horror, while this enemy is not 
affected by our boycott because all Westerners support it, based 
on all their hatred of us and racism in dealing with us. 
  What is the use of thinking about whether or not to amend 
the 
Arab League Charter if this is not preceded by a change in what 
is in the hearts of some of us, especially concerning the Arab 
peoples suffering from tragedies and disasters due to the 
pan-Arab and religious positions of some of us?

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Once Again: He Who Owns Nothing Gives To The </F>
Ones Who Do Not Deserve"] 
  [Text] Did U.S. President Bill Clinton offer Jerusalem as a 
gift to Israel even before the end of the ongoing negotiations 
with the PLO over self-rule and before the start of negotiations 
on the final status of the occupied territories? We pose this 
question in view of Clinton's recent statements to Jewish 
leaders on his claimed belief in the need to keep Jerusalem as 
the united capital of Israel. 
  President Clinton left such an issue to be decided during 
negotiations between the PLO and Israel on the final status of 
the occupied territories. However, the PLO, which agreed 
through the Oslo accord on a solution of unlinked phases, is now 
required to pause at the contents of Clinton's statements on 
Jerusalem, which, aside from its sanctity, also represents a 
large part of the West Bank area. If the PLO continues the 
negotiations while overlooking these statements, it will mean an 
implicit acceptance of a predetermined decision on the issue of 
occupied Jerusalem, even before negotiations on it begin. 
  The PLO and all the concerned Arab and Islamic parties are 
required to stress what Jordan has repeatedly stressed -- that 
sovereignty over holy Jerusalem can only belong to Almighty God, 
and that if peace is to be achieved in this part of the world, 
Jerusalem should be a symbol of peace and a meeting point for 
the sons of the three monotheistic religions. Jewish hegemony 
over Jerusalem will only fuel conflict and instability. 
  The continued Jewish insistence on clinging to Jerusalem as 
the united capital of Israel and the growing U.S. support for 
this direction should prompt the PLO -- which has shouldered the 
responsibility of negotiation over the issue of the West Bank 
territories occupied in the 1967 war, including Jerusalem -- to 
adopt a clear and sound stand on the issue of Jerusalem. Israel 
has repeatedly claimed Jerusalem is an inseparable part in 
tandem with increasing U.S. support for the annexation since the 
recent UN Security Council resolution in which the issue of 
Jerusalem was included. Washington had reservations over this 
issue and hence an agreement was reached to resume the 
negotiations despite these reservations and Clinton's statements 
on his belief that Jerusalem should remain united under Israel's 
control. 
  Since we are still in the first stage of the negotiations, 
we, as Arabs and Palestinians, are required to return to the 
strongest form of coordination so that we will not leave the 
door open for the Arab parties to be isolated and so we do not 
end up with results such as those which surprised us in the 
secret Oslo negotiations and the well-known Washington accord.

inquiry into yesterday's incident in the Jabalyah refugee camp, 
in which six Fatah members were killed by gunshots fired by 
undercover IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers. 
  Betzelem says that a probe conducted by its personnel 
reveals 
that the event was initiated by the IDF unit and that the 
soldiers deliberately opened fire without a warning and without 
firing in the air. According to Betzelem, the first round of 
fire was followed by another, which was apparently meant to 
ensure that the masked men were dead.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 
1130 GMT on 29 March reports: "The Shamgar Committee hearings 
on the Hebron massacre today tried to clarify two outstanding 
questions regarding the morning of the massacre: Why a 
policeman was not at his post at the Cave of the Patriarchs, and 
why three Border Police were late reaching the site? More from 
No'omi Segal: 
  "What emerged in testimonies on the failure of security 
arrangements to work properly on the morning of the massacre was 
a broken chain of command. In contradiction to an earlier 
testimony by head of Central Command Dani Yatom regarding the 
stationing of a policeman at the Cave of Patriarchs, commander 
of the Judaea District Police Moshe Mizrahi testified there was 
no standing order for a police officer to be present at the 
site. An alternative arrangement called for a police van to 
patrol the area, Mizrahi said, but on the morning of the 
massacre the police scheduled to patrol were unaware it was 
their turn. 
  "Eli Moyal, the Border Police duty officer the night before 
the massacre, answered questions on why three Border Police 
failed to reach their posts. I prepared a list of who had to be 
working, Moyal said, but the morning duty officer changed it. 
By the time three other Border Police were waken, it was too 
late, he said. 
  "Qiryat Arba' resident Eli'ezer Spitzer, who was in the jeep 
that gave Barukh Goldstein a lift to the Cave of the Patriarchs, 
also appeared before the commission. Spitzer said he noticed 
nothing unusual about Goldstein's behavior and, in response to 
the judges question, could not recall what kind of weapon 
Goldstein had. 
  "The commission tried to verify contradictions in testimony 
by a Muslim worshiper who was in the Cave of the Patriarchs at 
the time of the massacre, 'Abd-Rabbuh al-Atrash. He told the 
judges he heard two explosions and then firing, not one 
explosion, as he earlier told police. 
  "At this hour, Pinhas Eidelstein, who is the duty 
communications officer in Qiryat Arba', is appearing before the 
commission. Miryam Goldstein called Eidelstein minutes before 
the massacre, urging him to contact her husband. The judges are 
trying to clarify if there was anything in her tone that 
indicated alarm." 
  At 1600 GMT, Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English further 
reports: "Police Commissioner Rafi Peled testified this 
afternoon before the commission of inquiry into the Hebron 
massacre. He is now testifying behind closed doors. He told 
the Shamgar Committee there are different instructions for 
opening fire for the Army and the police. He intends to meet 
with the Central Command general to draft an order that would be 
acceptable to both the Army and police, but until then, the 
present orders would remain in force. Peled complained that a 
small force of police operating in the territories, and said 
that, in fact, police work boiled down to giving an appearance 
of law, instead of law enforcement. For instance, in Hebron 
there was one patrol of eight policemen -- the bare minimum for 
doing the work -- but this was better than in Yattah, where 
there were no policemen at all, and law was not enforced."

  [Excerpts] Likud Knesset Member Ari'el Sharon urges 
Hebron's Jewish settlers and their supporters to conduct a 
quiet, nonviolent, and unarmed struggle to secure their 
residence in Hebron, if the government decides to evacuate them. 
He was interviewed by our party affairs correspondent Menashe 
Raz: 
  [Begin recording] [Sharon] I think every effort should be 
made to avert an evacuation. I would like to urge all Israelis 
to engage in passive resistance to the evacuation. I am against 
harming IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers or the security 
forces in any way. I am speaking about passive resistance by 
tens of thousands of people, who should come empty-handed -- I 
stress, empty-handed, without any weapons whatsoever, because 
provocation of any kind should be prevented -- people who should 
persistently engage in resistance. If, God forbid, they manage 
to evacuate a certain place, tens of thousands of people should 
return there and resist the evacuation in a passive manner. In 
my view, right now this is the only, the ultimate move that can 
be undertaken against the insane actions of the government which 
is surrendering to PLO dictums -- although it says the decision 
was its own -- by evacuating Jews. [passage omitted] 
  [Raz] Will you be there yourself, when the time comes? 
  [Sharon] I will be there in person. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur by On </F>
Levi; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Levi] Was the latest katyusha 
shelling a violation of the agreement reached after Operation 
Accountability? 
  [Gur] The latest katyusha shelling was apparently carried 
out by one of the Palestinian organizations which broke away 
from the PLO in the wake of the peace accord. 
  [Levi] We seem to be lenient toward those Palestinian 
organizations since it was the second katyusha attack in the 
past month. 
  [Gur] We are not tolerant with anybody who shells us. I do 
not wish to go into all the operational, intelligence, and 
political problems, but you can be sure about one thing -- that 
we make every effort to locate them and reach them immediately 
and effectively, and I am certain we will do so. 
  [Levi] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] required more than 
20 hours to defeat four terrorists in Hebron. 
  [Gur] That is because of the tactics used, because of the 
fact we operated in a built-up area, since we want to reduce to 
a minimum the number of civilians harmed and to reduce to zero 
the risk to our fighters. It does not point to any reduction in 
the IDF's offensive capability. We have already stormed, 
conquered, and blown up much larger installations. The two 
constraining factors I mentioned above were very important, and 
that is why those tactics were used. They are special tactics 
for a built-up area of that type against a very defined target.

  [Text] Touring the Gaza Strip today, Lieutenant General 
Ehud Baraq, the chief of staff, said it is the IDF's [Israel 
Defense Forces] supreme duty to enforce law and order on Arabs 
and Jews alike. He further said that to foil terrorist attacks, 
officers and soldiers have to be alert and vigilant. An instant 
reaction by a soldier who finds himself on the scene of an 
attempted attack can make all the difference between a 
successful or a foiled attack. 
  Our correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that the chief of 
staff inspected the preparations for the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Uri Sagi, head of the IDF </F>
Intelligence Branch, by Smadar Peri; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Peri] This week, 'Arafat complained that his 
standing had been weakened as a result of the Hebron massacre. 
Do you believe that he really represents the Palestinian people? 
  [Sagi] I believe 'Arafat is not the only one who has been 
weakened. The Hebron massacre has undermined the ability of 
Palestinians and Israelis in general to conduct a dialogue. 
This despicable incident has exposed the raw nerves of the 
Arab-Israeli conflict -- and especially of the struggle between 
Palestinians and Israelis -- with all its religious, national, 
traditional, and cultural aspects. 
  'Arafat's standing has been greatly weakened in the 
territories. His pictures are no longer proudly displayed in the 
homes of the relatives of the Hebron massacre victims. 'Arafat, 
however, is the symbol of the PLO, which is the largest and most 
dominant organization. True, 'Arafat is facing a lot of 
opposition in the territories, even without the massacre, with 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] being the most prominent 
example. Public opinion in the territories, however, is less 
sensitive to political nuances and cares far more about 
security, standard of living, and being able to run their own 
affairs. Clearly, the more difficulty 'Arafat encounters in 
implementing his agreements with us, the weaker he will become. 
Time plays a critical role in his success in achieving what he 
regards as a favorable political settlement. If 'Arafat fails, 
his position will be undermined even further. 
  [Peri] Let me quote 'Ali Jad, a representative of the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Jerusalem, who 
said: "Beware, 'Arafat, you are not going to live for long." 
  [Sagi] These kind of statements are made by the rejectionist 
organizations which have political representatives as well as 
militant activists in the territories. 
  [Peri] Do you believe that 'Arafat's life is in danger? 
  [Sagi] The fact is that the lives of all political leaders 
who represent only part of their constituents are in danger. I 
think that 'Arafat's life -- just like the lives of other 
leaders who represent undemocratic societies -- is in danger. 
Especially if they take politically daring steps. 
  'Arafat's life expectancy depends, of course, on his ability 
to achieve a political arrangement. If and when he fails, we 
can assume that he will disappear. Paradoxically, if the 
political arrangement is a success, new and younger leaders from 
inside the territories will emerge. They are familiar with the 
conditions, the standard of living, and the security needs. 
They are much more knowledgeable about daily life than those 
who live in Tunis. 
  [Peri] Despite the differences between the Palestinians 
there appears to be one common denominator: they all want a 
Palestinian state. 
  [Sagi] There is no doubt about that. Their attitude has not 
changed. Although there is a higher degree of political realism 
in the territories now, they do not conceal their aspiration to 
establish a Palestinian state. 'Arafat, like the others, openly 
speaks about it. We expect them to demand the establishment of 
a Palestinian state. 
  Moreover, in the Gaza-Jericho First concept, 'Arafat was at 
great pains to try very hard to include elements with clear 
links to the permanent arrangement; or in other words, the 
Palestinian state. 
  [Peri] Do you believe that 'Arafat will be able to deliver 
the goods when he arrives in Jericho? 
  [Sagi] There is no doubt that the ideological dream may 
shatter when he assumes control and is confronted by the harsh 
and mundane reality. I do not think that 'Arafat was ever very 
good at handling daily affairs, nor do I believe that they 
particularly interest him. At any rate, he makes no secret of 
his ambitions, which are greater than running things in the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho. In his opinion, he is the president of some 
sort of political entity. 
  I therefore believe that he will engage in political 
activities that will necessitate his being abroad most of the 
time. According to his viewpoint, he would prefer not being 
mayor of Jericho at this stage. If and when the situation 
changes, he will set up permanent residence. 
  [Peri] When you talk about 'Arafat's trips abroad, are you 
referring to fund collection drives? 
  [Sagi] I mean taking care of the Palestinian economy, 
especially the budget. It is no secret that 'Arafat and very 
few of his closest associates have total control over the PLO 
budget. 
  [Peri] The PLO's economic situation is bad. 
  [Sagi] I cannot, understandably, present the PLO budget to 
the readers. Since the Gulf War the condition of the 
organization has deteriorated and external budget sources have 
quite closed up. They have certain reserves indeed, and I 
understand that the Sumud [as published] which is a senior 
economic organization controls the budget reservoirs, but in 
general, in my opinion, the PLO's financial condition is quite 
dire. 
  [Peri] This is a pessimistic picture of the situation to 
those who believe it is possible to disintegrate Hamas through 
financial temptations. 
  [Sagi] The PLO by itself, without outside aid and 
contributions, cannot for long guarantee control over events in 
the territories or the development and promotion of projects 
which will improve the quality of life there. Still, we have 
more than initial signs which indicate that if and when the 
Palestinian entity is set up, Hamas people will try to work 
their way into the system, as individuals if not as an 
organization, and the PLO leadership will agree. 
  [Peri] You are talking about the PLO leadership, but 'Arafat 
is a sole ruler, after all. He complains about opposition, but 
in the end he does as he pleases. 
  [Sagi] In theory, and perhaps also in practice, 'Arafat is a 
sole decision maker, perhaps also because he is capable of doing 
so. 
  [Peri] Do the Palestinians in the territories adapt 
themselves to the idea that they will have to live alongside the 
settlers? 
  [Sagi] The Palestinian aspiration is for the settlers to 
disappear naturally, but I believe that both sides, Israelis and 
Palestinians alike, understand it is better to put disagreements 
off for a later date, not because the problem will become 
smaller but with the hope that life will take its course and 
political maturity will enable the sides to solve this problem. 
  Theoretically, the Palestinians would prefer that the 
settlements be dismantled and moved to another site, within the 
Green Line boundaries. I have no doubt that this is a very 
serious matter which will feature very prominently during 
deliberations at the next stages. 
  As with the settlers, there is another, problematic and 
loaded issue: Jerusalem. Both sides agreed to postpone 
discussion of this issue to later stages. 
  [Peri] To what extent is talk in Israel about the evacuation 
of settlers from Hebron construed by the Palestinian side as a 
precedent for the continuation of the negotiations? 
  [Sagi] I would not like to comment on talk in Israel, but it 
is clear that the more diversified the Israeli positions are, 
the better the Palestinians' bargaining power becomes. 
  [Peri] You have been following 'Arafat since the beginning 
of the negotiations. Has he indeed changed? 
  [Sagi] I think you can say 'Arafat fully recognizes and 
controls his political actions. I am not going to comment on 
mental states attributed to 'Arafat that I have not observed. 
  [Peri] We have heard about tantrums, shouting, and 
feet-stomping. Are these tactics? 
  [Sagi] As human beings, we all get angry, and as political 
or military leaders, we all use different styles to attain goals 
or make things happen. 'Arafat requires no marks from me, but I 
would not say he has lost his way or control of himself. 
  [Peri] May we have your assessment on an issue which 
troubles us all: Will there be Palestinian retribution for the 
Hebron massacre? 
  [Sagi] Regardless of the various indications, the potential 
and desire for revenge requires no intelligence verification 
after such an incident. 
  One cannot lie back and think that since some time has 
passed 
the fury will blow over and the incident will be forgotten. 
Paradoxically, I believe that the more time passes without any 
dramatic act of revenge, the more we can expect a serious act of 
revenge. 
  [Peri] You have not calmed me. 
  [Sagi] It is not my duty to calm. My duty is to try and 
objectively describe what I know and estimate the results. 
Subjectively, I believe the more time passes, the closer we are 
to such an incident. 
  [Peri] It seems that you are not only preoccupied with the 
Syrian issue but it also interests you. Do you see any change 
with al-Asad's conception of the nature of peace? 
  [Sagi] I have not changed my position about the Syrians' 
concept and their drive toward a political arrangement, nor 
about what al-Asad will employ to obtain his goals. Still, 
noting changes in Syria does not mean that al-Asad, in whom I 
have taken interest lately, has become friendly to the Zionist 
idea or more amiable to the State of Israel. 
  I believe that al-Asad understood that Israel is stronger 
than Syria militarily, and he finds it difficult to reach 
strategic parity by himself in the face of what he defines as 
the Israeli threat. He surely feels isolated with his political 
concept within the Arab world. Despite his cooperation and 
close ties with Iran, he is very much aware of the danger of the 
fundamentalist Islamic wave. He understands he is totally 
isolated, and not only because the Soviet Union vanished but 
also because there is no super power other than the United 
States which is prepared to invest in our region. 
  [Peri] Al-Asad wants the entire Golan Heights from Israel. 
What exactly does he offer us in return? 
  [Sagi] I think that now more than ever, Syria understands 
that in return for sovereignty over the entire Golan Heights it 
will be required -- and I believe it will also agree -- to offer 
peace with its attendant components, including diplomatic 
relations. Still, I do not think that al-Asad defined publicly 
or to himself all components of normalization. 
  [Peri] Why? 
  [Sagi] At least for the tactical reason of conducting 
negotiations. In my opinion, he will refrain from unveiling the 
components of peace as long as he can help it. 
  [Peri] From al-Asad's viewpoint, is there any room to talk 
about full peace without a full withdrawal? Is there room to 
bargain on the extent of the withdrawal on the Golan? 
  [Sagi] I have not detected any readiness for compromise on 
al-Asad's part. From his viewpoint, he needs to believe he will 
receive the entire Golan Heights. Yet al-Asad also understands 
the other side of the coin, namely, that normalization with 
Israel is required. 
  There is a very deep psychological gap between the parties, 
a 
credibility gap. Each side demands of the other, as a 
precondition, that thing which he psychologically finds 
difficult to grant. As long as the gap is not bridged, it is 
very hard to progress, especially since the Israeli-Syrian 
negotiations are indeed the key to achieve a comprehensive 
settlement in the Middle East. 
  [Peri] In the meantime, Syria continues to purchase weapons, 
to build up militarily, and to acquire missiles. 
  [Sagi] Its military buildup is very impressive. The Syrians 
naturally claim that Israel is doing the same. It is clear the 
reference is not to two countries that are weakening militarily. 
It should be noted that as far as al-Asad is concerned, Israel 
has yet to clearly say "full withdrawal from the Golan Heights." 
  [Peri] From Israel's viewpoint, al-Asad is perceived as a 
cunning, stubborn political fox that is prepared to patiently 
lie in ambush for its prey. Can you read him? 
  [Sagi] I hope so. This is how I earn my living at least. 
  Unfortunately, I have not met him yet. I read almost 
everything written about him that is available to me. I also 
take an interest in him in terms of intelligence, which has many 
aspects to it. It would be pretentious of me to say that I know 
him as I would a family member, but I think I know him well 
enough to form an opinion. 
  Al-Asad is a very experienced person who knows the Middle 
East inside out. If I could wish for anything, I would prefer 
that he knew much more about the Israeli reality. 
  [Peri] He is said to be a man of honor who honors his 
commitments. 
  [Sagi] He is a man of reason, he is cautious and suspicious, 
and he has his reasons for this. To a very large degree it is 
possible to say that he is reliable as long as his interests are 
served. Proof of this is the disengagement agreement between 
Israel and Syria on the Golan, in effect since 1974. The 
stability of this agreement is almost unparalleled on any other 
border we share with the Arabs. 
  Suffice it to say that if and when he signs an agreement, he 
will keep his word, but I do not want to engage in a millenial 
vision here as this would not be a realistic depiction of the 
situation. There are still deep conflicts between Syria and 
Israel, and Syria is a very strong military country, a country 
which builds itself up militarily and which views Israel as its 
number one enemy. 
  [Peri] I would guess that as the sole leader at the top, 
al-Asad relies heavily on reports he receives from his 
intelligence services. 
  [Sagi] I can only hope that this enhances his understanding 
of Israel and perhaps also of world-wide political reality. To 
the best of my knowledge, he is under exposed to visits and 
foreign elements. 
  [Peri] Are we still defined in Damascus as "the Zionist 
enemy?" 
  [Sagi] We are now the "Israeli enemy." I have no doubt that 
al-Asad too, not just others, needs to overcome a deep 
psychological barrier. 
  [Peri] Since the regime in Syria is dictatorial in nature, 
does he at all need to prepare public opinion for peace with 
Israel? Will he have opposition? 
  [Sagi] I think he will. This is not, indeed, public opinion 
in the open, democratic style with which we are familiar, but to 
change the views of a nation which has been educated and 
accustomed to a very certain outlook requires time and 
preparation. Al-Asad mentioned this point in public interviews. 
He expressed his opinion that it is not only Israel which must 
prepare public opinion. 
  There is no opposition in Syria preventing al-Asad from 
pursuing the road he has chosen embarked, but I surely 
understand what he means when he mentions the need to prepare 
the masses. 
  [Peri] Did the death of his eldest son, Basil, have an 
influence on al-Asad's political considerations? 
  [Sagi] I do not know a well-balanced person who would not be 
affected by the death of his son, but this carries no political 
influence in my opinion. After all, we are talking about a man 
with a strong personality. 
  [Peri] But he is not young anymore. Al-Asad is 64 and his 
health is not so good. What will happen when he dies? 
  [Sagi] I do not know. Naturally, the question is when. I 
can detect enough stability among today's ruling group -- I am 
referring to four to five people -- to continue in al-Asad's 
direction, for a short period of time at least. 
  [Peri] The Egyptians, the go-between between ourselves and 
Damascus, persist in their claim that an Israeli-Syrian peace 
accord will be signed within a year. Do you share this 
assessment? 
  [Sagi] I prefer to be cautious, unless the Egyptians possess 
information they do not share. I cannot identify anything that 
would elicit such an unequivocal assumption. This may be a 
combination of wishful thinking and an assessment, although it 
is not totally unreasonable. 
  I would be wary of setting such a binding timetable, but I 
agree that the chance of achieving a political settlement is 
better than before. Circumstances, as well as each sides' 
positions, might have reached a level of maturity necessary for 
such a settlement to become a reality. 
  [Peri] How big a danger is posed to Mubarak's life, in your 
opinion? 
  [Sagi] Islamic resistance in Egypt is not new, and to the 
best of my knowledge, President Mubarak and the security forces 
in Egypt are stable enough to overcome this resistance, not 
without problems, but Egypt still seems able to manage as far as 
security and the stability of the regime are concerned. 
  At the same time, it is impossible to dismiss this danger 
completely. The Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamic terror 
organizations in Egypt believe there is an alternative and that 
the regime had better be replaced. There is increasing evidence 
that the numbers are increasing, at least, the number of 
incidents involving these organizations in Egypt. 
  [Peri] Are you troubled over what will take place if 
something bad happens to Mubarak? 
  [Sagi] This question, like others, concerns me and requires 
due attention. Egypt is the leader of the Arab world which 
marked the road to peace in this world. I think that the 
Egyptian-Israeli model is a good point of reference to all those 
who participate in peace negotiations. This is something which 
the Arab world experienced and, in my opinion, found to be 
better than anything else. 
  In my opinion, President Mubarak plays a very positive role 
in his readiness to show the benefits Egypt enjoys from its 
peace treaty with Israel and in his efforts to try to bridge the 
gaps between the sides. 
  [Peri] What is King Husayn's state of health? 
  [Sagi] According to official medical bulletins, I think he 
is in good health. For the time being, and to the best of my 
judgment, there are no negative implications or side effects. 
The king functions in a normal, reasonable, and full manner, 
and I wish him long life. 
  [Peri] What is the condition of Saddam Husayn? 
  [Sagi] Three years after the Gulf War, Iraq's internal 
problems are worsening, but not enough to threaten Saddam 
Husayn's control. This is demonstrated by isolation of the 
Kurdish enclave and the struggle with the Shiite population in 
the south. 
  Saddam is in control of his army and of security. His 
regime, although exposed to relatively -- but not sufficiently 
-- difficult economic and domestic problems, is stable for the 
time being. On quite a few occasions he has been successful in 
circumventing the economic embargo on Iraq by cooperating with 
foreign elements on both official and less official levels. 
  [Peri] What is your opinion of the reports and intimations 
that Saddam Husayn is interested in joining the peace process? 
  [Sagi] These are merely gimmicks and speculation. They are 
not worthy of any serious consideration. 
  [Peri] What about the other alternative? Should we expect 
more nasty surprises from him. 
  [Sagi] Iraq's military capabilities have not improved since 
the Gulf War. Their order of battle is small. They have 
maintenance problems and the army has to both protect the regime 
in Baghdad, deploy around the borders, and confront the Kurds. 
In addition, they have tense relations with Iran and are deeply 
involved in a struggle against the Shiites in the south. The 
Iraqi Army is still large and capable of protecting the regime 
but the danger of Iraq launching a military campaign against 
Israel without the backing of a united Arab coalition or some 
kind of strategic military upheaval in the region is reduced. 
  Obviously, I would prefer not to comment on Saddam Husayn's 
ambitions, which he may have not renounced. It would be 
irresponsible of me to say that there were definitely no signs 
or remnant of Iraq's strategic surface-to-surface missile or 
chemical warfare capabilities, or even of his continued attempts 
to develop his nuclear project. If the international 
supervision efforts are sufficiently effective, they may perhaps 
guarantee that Iraq will not regain its previous strength. I am 
not optimistic, however, concerning the effectiveness of the 
inspection teams. 
  [Peri] Can Israel monitor what is happening in Iraq today? 
  [Sagi] We do our best. But this becomes more difficult as 
distances grow. I would say that our ability to know what is 
happening and to monitor developments in Iraq has improved 
compared to the past. But we will never be able to confidently 
state that we know everything. I can note with satisfaction 
that in light of the intelligence need to cover every location 
whenever possible, the level of cooperation between Israel and 
other countries has increased. 
  [Peri] Are you referring to our intelligence cooperation 
with the United States? 
  [Sagi] Yes, but not only that. 
  [Peri] Despite all the warnings, assessments, and 
information, two IDF soldiers were killed in Lebanon this week. 
  [Sagi] Terrorism in Lebanon is not a new phenomenon. It is 
merely the scope of terrorist activity that changes. 
  [Peri] Does what happened last week constitute a violation 
of the understandings reached during "Operation Accountability." 
  [Sagi] I do not think so. It is most infuriating and 
painful but the way I see things there was no violation of these 
understandings, except for the firing of the katyusha rockets. 
Hizballah claims, although I disagree, that operations against 
the IDF and the SLA [South Lebanese Army] in the security zone 
does not violate the understandings we reached. If we retaliate 
against such activity, the situation will deteriorate. 
  [Peri] Who should restrain them? 
  [Sagi] The question is not who should but rather who is 
capable of restraining them. Nobody made such a commitment. It 
is no secret that Syria has the capability to control Hizballah 
or at least restrict its actions. They know how to do this and 
try to stop things from getting out of control. 
  [Peri] Now that we are conducting peace talks, do you 
detect mental blocks or inhibitions among your staff in running 
a different kind of intelligence service. Is there such a thing 
as peacetime intelligence? 
  [Sagi] I am not familiar with such an expression. My 
responsibility is to provide assessments for both the military 
and political echelons. I would even say that we are 
responsible for providing economic and technological information 
in all fields that present a threat to Israel. Only the 
integration of all these elements enables me to fulfill this 
responsibility and provide intelligence assessments at the 
national level. 
  Times have changed and sometimes the emphasis is placed on 
different things. The way we collect, analyze and process 
intelligence has also changed. It is the actual assessment 
report itself that highlights these different aspects. 
  It is important to stress that the IDF Intelligence Branch's 
top priority is still to give early warning about military 
threats to the State of Israel. This despite, and perhaps even 
because of, the political process. 
  The political process undoubtedly forces us to carry out a 
great deal of study and research. It necessitates our deep 
involvement. I would like to praise my people, who, despite the 
emphasis on early warning about military threats, correctly 
assessed, some three years ago, that a political shift of 
strategic significance for Israel was taking place. 
  [Peri] Are you primed to identify signs of peace? Tomorrow 
will mark the 15th anniversary of the signing of the peace 
treaty with Egypt, and I remember President 'Ezer Weizman 
remarking at the time that our intelligence dossiers had not 
been in step with developments. 
  [Sagi] I think it is our duty, and not only our privilege, 
to predict such developments. I think we have been successful 
enough to give Israel time to adequately prepare itself. 
  [Peri] What has really changed in the concepts and modus 
operandi of the Intelligence Branch since the start of the peace 
negotiations? 
  [Sagi] The Intelligence Corps is a large body, and not 
everyone necessarily does the same job. The integration process 
takes place at the higher levels. Some people handle the 
military side of things while others deal with the political 
process. The higher one goes up in the Intelligence hierarchy, 
the more integration is needed. 
  As for the threats, our intelligence package has greatly 
expanded. Today, collecting intelligence on threats in Iran, 
Iraq, or Libya is no longer a fantastic notion. This has a 
profound impact: we have to invest heavily in people, 
equipment, input, and in formulating concepts. 
  The political aspect requires additional 
information-collection investments in people and places. 
Without singing my own praises, I think we have good 
intelligence. I do not believe that Israel suffers from an 
intelligence block that prevents the political echelon from 
making decisions. 
  [Peri] Did you think that the political process would be as 
long, winding, complex, and complicated? 
  [Sagi] I said that the process would be complicated and 
strewn with crises. Difficult, with many stalemates. But the 
general trend I identified -- and I still adhere to my position 
-- will be progress toward a political settlement. Whether or 
not such a settlement will really be achieved depends on both 
parties. 
  [Peri] What will the Middle East look like in another two 
years? Will there be peace and open borders or hunger and 
Islamic terrorism? 
  [Sagi] The fundamental problems will continue. Economic 
problems will grow worse. There are very serious demographic 
problems and a lack of resources. The Islamic wave has not 
reached its crest yet nor has terrorist extremism. 
  On the other hand, additional progress will be made in the 
political process which will moderate things to a certain 
degree. We may reach agreement with the Arab world on issues of 
joint interest. 
  The water problem and the military threat will remain. 
However, I believe that the Arab countries will not expand 
their budgets for military buildup purposes. Even Syria, which 
has systematically built up its army, has not increased its 
military budget. 
  [Peri] What about war? 
  [Sagi] War is still a threat in the Middle East but that 
does not mean that the prospects for war have increased. On the 
contrary, I think that the chances for a war in the foreseeable 
future have been greatly reduced. The probability of war does 
not necessarily grow if and when the political process runs into 
a problem. 
  Nevertheless, if the political process runs aground, 
developments in Syria will warrant special attention and a 
higher level of interest from us. 
  [Peri] Who in your opinion is the most intriguing Arab 
leader? 
  [Sagi] All of them are intriguing. However, I would say 
that personally I am most interested in al-Asad. He is the Arab 
leader that can have the most impact on the realization of my 
assessments. 
  [Peri] During your tenure as head of the Intelligence 
Branch, which Arab leader has made the most progress? 
  [Sagi] 'Arafat. It is interesting to note that he thinks 
the same thing about us. He is not alone in this assumption. 
There are other Arab leaders who think that Israel was the one 
to come a long way. 
  [Peri] Which Arab country would you like to visit? 
  [Sagi] I would like to go everywhere. I have been to Egypt 
because that is allowed. 
  [Peri] The hottest topic of discussion in both Israel and 
the Arab world is the commission of inquiry into the Hebron 
massacre. Are you following the hearings? 
  [Sagi] Like every other Israeli citizen. 
  [Peri] And as a major general in the IDF, how do you feel 
about it? 
  [Sagi] I do not wish to comment on issues outside of my 
purview. 
  [Peri] Where do you see yourself in another year or two? 
  [Sagi] I hope that I will still be functioning and in good 
health.

<F P=106> [Article by Aviva Shabi and Tzvi Singer: "The Mentors"] </F>
  [Text] In the meeting of the National Religious Party 
[NRP] Knesset faction, held last week in the shadow of the 
detentions of Kakh and Kahana Hay activists, Hanan Porat spoke 
of the need to establish a spiritual leadership, a sort of 
council of Torah scholars for the Zionist-religious movement. 
  Porat, who is running for party leadership, has been 
preaching setting up such a leadership for quite a while. He 
wants it to be made of the first-rank of rabbis, such as Avraham 
Shapira, Sha'ul Yisra'eli, and Moshe Tzvi Neriya. The context 
in which the remarks were made this time was somewhat different. 
According to Porat, such a forum could make decisions that 
would compel the rabbis to support, openly or tacitly, acts such 
as the Hebron massacre. 
  Two of the names mentioned in this context were Rabbi 
Yisra'el Ari'el, of the Temple Institute [makhon hamiqdash] in 
Jerusalem, formerly the rabbi of Yamit; and Rabbi Dov Li'or, the 
Qiryat Arba' rabbi and the head of the high school-yeshiva in 
town. 
  It was no accident that the two, Ari'el and Li'or, led the 
funeral of the murderer-doctor, and even eulogized him. Ari'el 
compared Goldstein to Judas Maccabaeus and Samson, who killed 30 
men with the jawbone of an ass, and called him a martyr. 
  In his eulogy at the Qiryat Arba' yeshiva, addressing 
hundreds including the yeshiva students, Rabbi Li'or described 
the deceased as a man full of love for his fellow men "who could 
no longer take the humiliation and the disgrace. Everything he 
did was in honor of Israel and for the glory of God." 
  Li'or should know a little about Goldstein's love of men. 
For months, the Qiryat Arba' doctor devotedly treated the 
rabbi's first wife who was dying of cancer. On the night she 
died, he sat with Rabbi Li'or till dawn. 
  The embarrassment Rabbi Ari'el's remarks caused in the 
Zionist-religious camp, can be seen in the following story: 
Last Wednesday, the heads of the Bney 'Aqiva [NRP's] youth 
movement held a sympathy tour of Qiryat Arba' and Hebron. 
During a meeting with members of the movement, some of them 
lashed out at the movement leaders for their decision to 
demonstrate in Jerusalem in protest of the Hebron massacre. 
Yaron Te'ena, head of the instruction department, told his 
listeners that he held a conversation with Rabbi Yisra'el Ari'el 
after he promoted Dr. Goldstein to martyr. 
  "I could not believe that the rabbi really made such 
remarks," Te'ena said, "but I realized that he insists and that 
he bases his statements on Samson's heritage. I asked Rabbi 
Ari'el: Has there been no exile, state, and sovereignty since 
Samson? Has nothing changed? And he said: You still have a 
lot to learn." 
  Rabbis such as Li'or and Ari'el disturb the NRP heads for 
good reason. First, they make all of the Judaea, Samaria, and 
Gaza rabbis look like extremists. Second, they inspire 
followers such as Goldstein. Those spiritual mentors do not 
openly identify with Kahana's movement, but their world view is 
pretty close. Things they do not explicitly say, often remain 
open for personal interpretations. Things are quite often said 
behind closed doors -- during yeshiva classes on Jewish 
philosophy and ethics -- under the assumption that they will not 
reach the ears of the secular public. When they leak, they cause 
major storms. 
  Four years ago, Rabbi Neriya, head of the Bney 'Aqiva 
yeshivas, was at the center of such storm when a letter he wrote 
was read out in a conference of rabbis in Jerusalem. The 
conference was held to protest the conviction of Rabbi Levinger 
of causing the death of a Hebron shoe trader. Neriya, who won 
an Israel Award for education and is admired by tens of 
thousands, wrote for the occasion about the type of distress in 
which Levinger found himself. He said that "this is not a time 
to think; it is time to shoot left and right, and do everything 
required to chase away murderers who rise to break your skull, 
stab you through the heart, or break your bones...." 
  Neriya explained that he was speaking of acts of 
self-defense 
when under a death threat. He did not even think of condemning 
the rabbi who, according to the judges' ruling, shot 
indiscriminately and endangered the lives of innocent people. 
  This argument surprised no one, considering the enormous 
importance of rabbinical decrees for the religious public. Upon 
his detention in 1984, Menahem Livni, head of the Jewish 
underground, wrote about the support of "Qiryat Arba' rabbis" 
for "acts of mass terrorism" staged to deter the Arab population. 
  The names mentioned in that document were Rabbi Li'or, Rabbi 
Waldman, Rabbi Levinger, and Rabbi Yo'ezer Ari'el. Equipped 
with the rabbis' support, the members of the Jewish underground 
went to assassinate Arab mayors. This support, however, did not 
help them when they were arrested. The rabbis were questioned 
by the police, but came out unharmed by the whole affair. 
  Rabbi Li'or is no eccentric, nor does he belong to the 
maniacal fringes; he is the flesh and bone of the 
religious-Zionism. He is a graduate of the Merkaz Harav Yeshiva 
in Jerusalem, and an assiduous follower of late Rabbi Tzvi 
Hakohen Kook. Therefore, any attempt to dismiss him is very 
difficult. Li'or is considered a superb halakic ruler and 
diligent scholar; he was Chief Rabbi Shapira's candidate for the 
post of judge at the Rabbinical High Court in Jerusalem. The 
state attorney ruled out his candidacy due to his racist remarks. 
  His opinions were expressed, among other places, in a letter 
Li'or sent several years ago to a military physician who asked 
for his opinion about practicing giving intravenous injections 
on detained Arab terrorists in the framework of a military 
drill. "If it is possible to conduct experiments on worthless 
persons, who deserve to die in a country ruled by law, and if 
this is being suggested by a soldier, and if it could be done, 
it should," the rabbi wrote in his reply. Another remark 
attributed to Li'or was made in a conference of rabbis: 
"Several Arabs should be sent to heaven for each Jewish 
fatality." Several people who attended talks and classes with 
Li'or have claimed that these remarks are among the most 
moderate he has ever made regarding the Arabs. 
  Rabbi Ari'el is also a graduate of Merkaz Harav. He served 
as the Northern Command chaplain; as a paratrooper, he took part 
in the battle for Jerusalem and the taking of the Western Wall 
in the Six-Day War; and headed the high school-yeshiva of Yamit 
with his brother, Rabbi Ya'aqov Ari'el, today the chief rabbi of 
Ramat Gan. Another Ari'el brother is Yo'ezer who teaches in 
Li'or's yeshiva in Qiryat Arba'. The fourth brother, Yig'al, is 
the rabbi of the Golan settlement of Nov. Yig'al Ari'el was one 
of the rabbis who strictly condemned the massacre. 
  Yisra'el is considered the most extreme brother. He is 
remembered from the evacuation of Yamit as the one who called on 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers to refuse orders. After 
the evacuation, he used his compensation money to buy a luxury 
apartment in the Jewish Quarter in Jerusalem, and established 
the Temple Institute. In the 1981 elections he was No. 2 on 
Kahana's list of candidates for the Knesset. In 1983 he was 
arrested along with Kakh activist Barukh Marzel during a 
security forces operation to foil an attempt by extremists to 
take over the Temple Mount. Incidentally, Rabbi Li'or is an 
ardent supporter of redeeming the Temple Mount. He even urged 
putting up a fence around the al-Aqsa mosque, preventing alien 
access to it, and setting up a Jewish house of prayer next to it. 
  Another outstanding representative of the extremist craze is 
Rabbi Yitzhaq Ginsburg, the rabbi of the 'Od Yosef Hay Yeshiva. 
He is highly thought of by the settlers who used to be secular. 
He is of American origin, and belongs to Habad. His 
association with Gush Emunim and the Merkaz Harav school of 
thought was made possible through the students of the yeshiva he 
heads. Some say he was adopted by them to provide them with 
ideological legitimacy. His influence on the national religious 
public is insignificant. 
  Ginsburg's Kahanist views were first revealed when he 
defended one of his students who opened fire at Arab workers on 
the Geha road. After five of his students were arrested on 
suspicion of killing an Arab girl in the village of Kifl Harith, 
he declared that "Jewish blood and Arab blood are not equal." 
He remained firm even after a complaint was filed against him 
with the police for racist incitement, and after NRP Secretary 
General Sha'ul Yahalom demanded that he be ousted from his role 
as yeshiva head. 
  In an interview with HA'ARETZ's Ya'ir Sheleg, Ginsburg 
confirmed that he supports some of Kahana's ideas. He clarified 
his stands by saying that "there is a great difference in the 
punishment becoming a person who hurts a Jew and a person who 
hurts a gentile... the life of a Jew is worth much more than the 
lives of many gentiles." The reverberation this remark caused 
did not prevent the heads of Gush Emunim from holding a 
conference of sympathy and encouragement for the Nabulus yeshiva 
students. 
  It should be stressed that the three do not carry equal 
halakic weight. Rabbi Li'or is considered a most senior 
authority, while Ari'el and Ginsburg are said to have much less 
impact. "At the same time," Prof. Ehud Sprinzak of the Hebrew 
University in Jerusalem says, "if ever a new Jewish underground 
is set up in Israel, the people who found it will first ask 
those three to legitimize their acts." Sprinzak specializes in 
studying radical right-wing movements. Among others, he studied 
the Jewish underground. 
  "There has been no act by the Jewish underground which did 
not have a rabbinical backing," Sprinzak said. "Even the plans 
that were not carried out, such as blowing up the Temple Mount 
mosques, were canceled because the rabbis did not approve of 
them. Hence, there is a chance that the most radical elements 
of Gush Emunim will seek extremist rabbis' support if they ever 
decide to establish a new underground. The three rabbis 
mentioned here are certainly potential addresses should matters 
deteriorate, and I am afraid they will." The three rabbis, 
incidentally, refused to be interviewed for this article. 
  After the underground was uncovered in the summer of 1984, 
Rabbi Ari'el set up a small group called Tzfiyya [observation]. 
Rabbi Li'or was also part of this ideological group. According 
to Prof. Sprinzak, "this was the only group of the entire 
national-religious camp which provided the Jewish underground 
with absolute halakic backing after it was uncovered." 
  In a lengthy article Rabbi Ari'el published in the TZFIYYA 
booklet, he determined, among other things, that the commandment 
"you shall not kill" does not apply to Arabs; according to his 
interpretation, the ban only applies to Jews. Rabbi Ari'el 
found halakic support for his claim that when Jews murder Jews 
they should be tried in courts on earth, but anyone who murders 
an Arab will only be tried in heaven. 
  In his article, Ari'el launched an unprecedented attack at 
the Gush Emunim rabbis for hurrying to condemn the members of 
the Jewish underground. He equated the "character 
assassination" done to the members of the underground with 
actual murder, and determined that "he who shames his friend -- 
loses his share of heaven." He wrote: "That which is said here 
does not apply to those who, for our sins, departed with the 
Torah and, as part of their overall indiscretion, make mistakes 
on this issue as well. Why should we complain about them? It 
is very painful, however, to hear such disgraceful remarks made 
by rabbis! Our friends! Let us assume, God forbid, that we are 
talking of murderers. A murderer of the flesh who served his 
term, does not lose his share of the afterlife. And what of the 
murderer of the soul...?" 
  The teachings of Rabbi Kahana are, therefore, the obvious 
and 
hidden thread connecting the three rabbis. A thorough 
examination of the stands reveals a surprising similarity 
between their stands and the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
concepts on cardinal issues: Both share a vision of a religious 
state between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea; and 
xenophobia which refers to aliens or the secular ("infidels" as 
the fundamentalist Muslims call it; Hellenizers, as Kahana 
called it); they both demand that all aliens be removed from the 
entire holy land; both perceive the conflict as an East-West 
cultural clash; and they both reject the Western culture, the 
source of all evil that came upon the nation. 
  "We should know what the reality is," Rabbi Li'or wrote. 
"The Torah is very explicit: "But if you do not drive out the 
inhabitants of the land from before you, then those of them whom 
you let remain shall be as pricks in your eyes and thorns in 
your sides, and they shall trouble you in the land where you 
dwell." He further wrote in favor of the notion of transfer: 
"Removing the Arab residents of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza is a 
state task." 
  Rabbi Ari'el: "The Arabs who do not want to be transported 
will be given the status of non-Jewish residents. They will 
have to abide by the seven commandments of the sons of 
Noah....Those who want will be able to remain, but they will not 
be able to receive any administrative post or any other kind of 
post. They will be able to be shepherds and merchants...they 
will be second rate citizens." 
  Elsewhere: "Eretz Yisra'el was allotted only to the people 
of Israel, and is not meant for the settlement of foreigners, 
non-Jewish residents, or even to proselytes." 
  According to Ari'el the patriarchs' allotted territory is 
equivalent to the area promised to Abraham, stretching from the 
Mediterranean to Iraq, including parts of Syria, Jordan, and 
Lebanon. During the Lebanon War, Ari'el declared that "Lebanon 
is part of our flesh, just as Tel Aviv and Haifa." Rabbi Li'or 
also said during the Lebanon War that "the territory of the 
tribes of Asher, Naphtali, and Zebulun has been 
liberated...therefore it is inconceivable to even think of 
returning this area to the gentiles." 
  In a conference of NRP rabbis, Li'or stated that the Arabs 
are lagging years behind us, and "we are fools for improving the 
living conditions of those who want to destroy us." Another 
pearl of wisdom emitted by him in TZFIYYA: We cannot make real 
peace with the Ishmaelites. One of the Arabs' characteristics 
is that they hate peace." 
  It is no coincidence that Li'or agreed with the definition 
of 
the intifadah as a war: in an interview to IDF Radio he said 
that "in a state of war the prohibition against hurting innocent 
people does not apply and collective punishment is permissible." 
Incidentally, Li'or does not find only the Arabs hard to live 
with. According to him, correspondents should also be added to 
the list of those are unfit for halakic testimony, whereas 
leftists he defines as traitors. 
  In a lesson to his students, Rabbi Ari'el once ruled that a 
Jewish doctor must never aid a Christian or Muslim casualty 
unless he is paid for doing so. Baruq Goldstein probably 
fulfilled this ruling when he refused to treat Hizballah 
casualties in Lebanon. 
  Prof Sprinzak emphasizes that Ari'el, who suffered greatly 
as 
a result of his activity in Yamit and in Kakh, is no longer 
active in the militant groups. He "came out of the closet" 
while delivering his obituary to Goldstein. However, one of the 
settlements' rabbis, who asked to remain unnamed, related the 
following story: 
  "Several years ago -- after one of the mass terror attacks 
-- 
a student rose up during one of my lessons and said he wanted to 
retaliate. He quoted Rabbi Ari'el as an authority for this sort 
of action. Since I could not dissuade him, I suggested that we 
both call Ari'el and ask for his opinion. Ari'el's answer: I 
do not recommend to do so, but I also cannot say that I oppose 
it." 
  Other rabbis in the territories, such as Rabbi Eli'ezer 
Melamed, secretary of the committee of settlements' rabbis, are 
trying to downplay the influence of the extremists. Melamed 
emphasizes that Rabbi Ari'el has no official capacity and that 
his influence is minimal. He says that "people who tend to be 
extremist can seek support in him. They would remain extremist, 
however, whether Rabbi Ari'el existed or not. I doubt whether 
even one percent of the settlers are as extremist as him." 
  What about Rabbi Li'or? 
  Rabbi Elyaqim Levanon of Elon More says that "most of the 
time his opinions are no different than those of other 
settlements' rabbis. He has a distinct personal style, but his 
principles are similar to ours." 
  One settlement rabbi adds that "great as his halakic 
authority is, Li'or is politically naive. He might say that 
'the Arabs are evil and we must fight and harm them.' When one 
asks him, however, whether such acts should be initiated, he 
will answer: 'to initiate such acts? how can anybody initiate 
such acts of his own volition?'" 
  The problem is that talking is precisely Jewish rabbis' 
stock-in-trade, whether they proffer counsel to individuals or 
give lectures to large audiences. The various Goldsteins 
require no more than a vague statement for carrying out their 
deeds.

  [Text] Baghdad, 29 Mar (INA)--The newspaper AL-'IRAQ has 
described the UN Security Council's decision to invite Special 
Commission Chairman Ekeus to make a monthly review of the 
details of his commission's work and the progress that it makes 
as an important step reflecting greater appreciation by the UN 
Security Council states of Iraq's cooperation. 
  In an article today, the paper, which is issued here, 
stresses the need for a specific mechanism for the commission's 
work and activities. It says matters should not be left 
undecided and unspecific, something that would exclude any 
possible action to swiftly implement Paragraph 22 of Part C of 
Resolution 687. 
  The paper says that throughout the past period, it was clear 
from the way the commission conducted its business that the 
commission was procrastinating despite Iraq's sincere 
cooperation, and although its various subcommittees visited Iraq 
dozens of times and submitted authenticated and detailed reports 
testifying to Iraq's cooperation. 
  The paper explains that under U.S. pressures, the commission 
was involved in gimmicks and sharp contradictions between what 
has actually been achieved on the ground and Commission Chairman 
Ekeus' unsubstantiated statements. 
  The paper adds: Iraq is aware of the causes of U.S. 
pressures on the commission and the attempts to force it not to 
acknowledge facts. Iraq is also aware of the way nations' 
issues are run and discussed inside the halls of the UN Security 
Council and how plots are concocted and facts falsified to 
control other peoples' and their wealth, preventing them from 
exercising their independent free will. The paper notes that 
all this takes place under slogans of "international legitimacy 
and international law." 
  The paper says experience has proved the practices of United 
States and its satellites inside and outside the UN Security 
Council are a very long way from true legitimacy, law, and 
justice. These nations are ready to ignore all ethical and 
human standards for the sake of their colonialist interests and 
global policies. 
  The paper stresses that after the recent UN Security 
Council's decision, the Special Commission should be freed of 
U.S. influence and hostile polices against Iraq. The commission 
should deal with facts impartially, objectively, and fairly, and 
it should not be dragged to unjust stands that further increase 
the suffering of the Iraqi people. 
  Concluding its article, AL-'IRAQ says fair people in this 
world have become absolutely convinced that any delay in lifting 
the blockade can be classified as a major crime whose 
responsibility rests with the sides that obstruct the adoption 
of the only resolution that reflects responsibility, justice, 
and law--a resolution lifting the blockade.

<F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Announcer Obima] Now, let us go to the G-15 -- 
that meeting in Delhi of 15 major developing countries. One of 
the main issues being discussed there are seats on the UN 
Security Council. And, on the line is Nigeria's foreign 
minister, Babagana Kingibe. Good morning, Mr. Kingibe. 
  [Begin recording] [Kingibe] Good morning. 
  [Obima] The issue of the UN Security Council that is going 
to 
be discussed -- you all seem to want to sit on the UN. Is 
Nigeria still pressing for a seat on the UN? 
  [Kingibe] Well, as you know, we are on the UN and we are a 
nonpermanent member of the Security Council. I think you must 
be referring to the reform, efforts for the reform of the UN 
system which would allow the expansion of the permanent 
membership of the UN Security Council in such a way as to ensure 
fair representation of all the regions of the world in the light 
of current realities, in the post-cold war situation. And, in 
that regard, of course, we should definitely be interested, if 
the responsibility is going to be (?thrust) on us. 
  [Obima] Is that expansion a very realistic aspiration at 
this 
time, do you feel? 
  [Kingibe] Well, of course, because don't forget that the 
genesis of the UN -- that is, an organization which was formed 
after the First World War by the.... [pauses] after the Second 
World War by the victors of that war. And, it was in fact 
designed to answer some of the shortcomings of the experience of 
the League of Nations, to the give the UN system some peace.... 
[pauses] to enable it maintain peace and security in the world. 
And it is in that context that all the provisions about the 
Security Council, about veto power and enforcement capabilities 
and so on, were incorporated into the Charter of the UN. And, I 
think a lot of time has elapsed since then. The world today is 
not the same as the post-45 world and new realities have to be 
taken into account. I think the current trend worldwide is for 
democratization, for fair representation, for equity, and I do 
not think that these concepts are only good enough within 
national boundaries. They ought to be extended to the 
operations and organization of the international organizations 
also. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Excerpt] The brother leader of the revolution received 
leaders of the Palestinian alliance forces: the Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine, the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine, the Islamic Jihad Movement, Fatah 
Movement-Intifadah, the Palestinian Liberation Front, the 
Palestinian Front for the Popular Struggle, the Palestinian 
Communist and Revolutionary Party, the Vanguards of the 
Palestinian Liberation Party, the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command, and the Islamic 
Resistance Movement -- Hamas. 
  The Palestinian alliance forces have issued a statement in 
which they stressed that their meeting with the brother leader 
of the revolution falls within an awareness of the historic 
responsibility shouldered by the pan-Arab forces that are 
resisting the plans of submission and Zionist dominion. Within 
this framework, developments on the Arab and international 
arenas were discussed, in particular developments related to 
occupied Palestine in the aftermath of the massacres that are 
being committed by the Zionist enemy against the Palestinian 
people, the latest of which is the sacred Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre. 
  The statement reiterated the rejection of the Palestinian 
people and its revolutionary and pan-Arab forces of the unjust 
and unfair measures that are imposed against the Great 
Jamahiriyah by the so-called UN Security Council. The statement 
underlined that these measures are a result of the principled 
and firm stance of the Great Jamahiriyah and its commitment to 
issues of the Arab nation, foremost of which is its fundamental 
issue, Palestine, and its rejection of the U.S.-Western-Zionist 
domination plan. 
  These measures not only target the Arab Libyan people, but 
they also target the whole Arab nation. The sons of the Arab 
nations and its dynamic forces are called upon to work towards 
putting an end to the embargo, which they should not honor. 
  The statement pointed out that the leader's view of these 
developments truly expressed the (?Arab nation's) goals and 
aspirations and its adherence to its national and historical 
rights to protect its interests, wealth, and sovereignty. 
  The statement of the Palestinian alliance forces said that 
Jerusalem was a holy land for the divine religions and the 
capital of struggling Palestine. The masses of our people will 
never accept anything other than that and will resist the 
Zionist plan targeting its Arab nature, obliterating its 
history, and Judaising it. 
  Accusing our Palestinian people and our Arab and Islamic 
nation of terrorism was only a conspiracy against our right to 
freedom and life in order to force us to neglect our just 
humanitarian demands. 
  We do not practice terrorism, and we do not target unarmed 
innocents, as they do, but we seek freedom, which is guaranteed 
by all laws and divine codes and confirmed by human rights 
conventions. 
  We are for the just peace that guarantees the legitimate 
rights for our struggling Palestinian people and our fighting 
Arab and Islamic nation. 
  We reject and resist, and we call and mobilize the masses of 
the Arab and Islamic nation to resist and overthrow, the 
imposition of hegemony and domination in the name of peace. 
  The submission projects put forward through the Madrid 
process and Washington, the bilateral and multilateral talks, 
and the Oslo talks are considered an abandonment of our people 
and nation's rights that will not achieve peace. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Damascus Urges Israel To </F>
Accept Recent Syrian Proposals in Washington"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- A Syrian official has stated that 
ending tension and establishing peace require an end to the 
Israeli occupation represented by the Israeli Army and 
settlements, the return of the occupied territories to their 
owners, and acceptance of the recent Syrian proposals submitted 
during the Washington negotiations to ensure objectivity and 
balance. This indicates that there has been no change in the 
Syrian proposals and views on the peace negotiations and topics 
of discussion in these negotiations with the Israelis since U.S. 
envoy Dennis Ross's visit to Damascus. 
  The Syrian official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the chain of 
events since the stumbling Palestinian-Israeli agreement has 
proved the Syrian views to be correct and demonstrated that 
partial solutions do not establish peace in the region, that the 
peace proposed by Syria is in harmony with the Security Council 
resolutions and the essence of the U.S. initiative, and that the 
Israelis should not believe that without such a peace the Middle 
East could possibly emerge from the circle of wars, violence, 
and disturbances. 
  The Syrian official accused Israel of obstructing any 
progress in the peace process and of persisting in its practices 
which are preventing the U.S. efforts from making any progress. 
The Syrian official also said: Israel cannot continue to 
pursue that line. It is very important that it should abide by 
Security Council Resolution 904 and accept international 
protection for the Palestinian people. It is also important 
that it should, in future Washington negotiations, discuss the 
future of the occupied territories and undertake to withdraw 
from them. 
  He added that the Washington negotiations cannot go on for 
ever and cannot remain as they are now. He said that Israel has 
two options, namely peace and security or return to wars and the 
law of the jungle. That is why the United States, which is 
committed to peace, is requested to play the main part in 
bringing about a change and in making Israel comply with the 
basis of the peace process, that basis being the U.S. proposals. 
  The Syrian official pointed out that the massacres Israel is 
committing against the Palestinian people can only mean that 
Israel does not want peace, and that the failure to take any 
serious and practical measures against the Israeli policy has 
encouraged Rabin's government to commit more massacres and more 
acts of terrorism, as confirmed when six people were martyred 
and dozens wounded last Wednesday. 
  The Syrian official said that any progress in the peace 
process will depend on ending Israel's disregard for the United 
Nations and its resolutions.

  [Excerpts] Beirut -- Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri has 
stated that the recent series of explosions and the political 
confusion in his country sought to bring down the state. 
However, it had the opposite effect. [passage omitted] 
  In an interview with AL-BAYAN, the Lebanese prime minister 
said that certain individuals tried to exacerbate the situation 
and divide the people to influence the visit Pope John Paul II 
is scheduled to pay to Lebanon on 28 May. He said they wanted 
to influence the pope to adopt the opposition's viewpoint and 
stand. Al-Hariri stressed that the pope's visit will take place 
as scheduled in spite of all these circumstances. [passage 
omitted] 
  Al-Hariri told AL-BAYAN that his government is in the 
process 
of adopting a plan to review the recent threats against the 
state. 
  Al-Hariri stressed that this review, which his government 
started by tackling the situation on the judicial, security, and 
information levels, stems from the fact that his government will 
puruse its tasks without a cabinet reshuffle. 
  Al-Hariri said he expects the general atmosphere in the 
Middle East, particularly in Lebanon to change in light of the 
satisfaction with the UN Security Council resolution condemning 
the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beirut, 26 Mar (MENA)--A Lebanese newspaper today 
published new information about the Lebanese network that 
recently carried out a series of sabotage operations, most of 
whose members have been arrested. 
  Lebanon's AL-SAFIR says that Israel played a key role in 
planning these operations. Two Israeli officers from the Shin 
Bet, Israel's state security service, paid several visits to 
Lebanon and held contacts and meetings with the members of the 
network. Some of these meetings took place in Israel and 
Cyprus. The paper adds that employees of the Lebanese Forces' 
security service took part in these meetings. 
  The paper says that members of this network live outside 
Lebanon. They were transported to Lebanon on rubber dinghies 
with the help of the Israeli Navy to carry out these sabotage 
operations and plant explosives in places of worship and the 
headquarters of political parties and to attack religious 
leaders in the Christian areas. 
  AL-SAFIR says that after the Sayyidat al-Najat Church 
explosion, most of the members of the group that carried out the 
operation were evacuated by sea or by infiltrating across the 
occupied border strip with forged identity cards. 
  The paper says that the Lebanese security services received 
important information about the suspects and explosives experts 
who had carried out such operations during the civil war, thus 
facilitating the quick arrest of the network members. 
  The paper explains that the information and confessions 
obtained by the security services confirm that this network had 
planned a further series of explosions in the Christian areas to 
strongly shock the Christian community, cause sectarian strife, 
and encourage Christian fundamentalists to begin clamoring for 
autonomous security organs for the Christian community and 
demanding international protection. 
  The newspaper AL-SAFIR says that the operations involved 
attacks against places of worship and clerical and political 
figures and the desecration of Christian cemeteries. The 
masterminds of these operations aimed to undermine national 
unity, disrupt relations with Syria -- a country that provides 
Lebanon with its current security umbrella -- upset Syrian-U.S. 
relations, impede the peace talks, and abort Pope John Paul II's 
visit to Lebanon, scheduled for late May. 
  AL-SAFIR says that the scheme also aimed to point the finger 
of accusation at the Lebanese Muslims after the discovery of an 
unexploded bomb bearing the inscription: "There is no God but 
God." 
  The paper accuses some French quarters of trying to 
establish 
an unofficial bridge between Lebanon and Israel by arranging a 
meeting between former Lebanese Army Commander General Michel 
'Awn, currently living in Paris, and Uri Lubrani, coordinator of 
Israeli activity in Lebanon and the head of the delegation 
negotiating with Lebanon.

  [Excerpt] The Council of Ministers held a session today 
under Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, during which 
it discussed several issues, including the measures taken in the 
port of al-'Aqabah and the Straits of Tiran against 
al-'Aqabah-bound vessels. The council also discussed the 
situation in the occupied territories in the wake of the 
arbitrary Israeli measures there. 
  Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for Cabinet Affairs 
and Information Minister, held a news conference on the issues 
that the cabinet discussed today. 
  [Begin al-'Anani recording] The Council of Ministers today 
reviewed the measures that are being taken in the port of 
al-'Aqabah and the Straits of Tiran to search vessels on their 
way to Jordan, and the great losses the Jordanian economy incurs 
due to these measures. These losses have been estimated at more 
than $1.3 billion from 1990 until now. These sums have been 
paid by the Jordanian consumer and importer as a result of the 
unreasonable measures that are used to search the vessels or to 
send them back. This has made the prices of cargo spiral to a 
point that has greatly affected the Jordanian economy. 
  The government believes that the current search operations 
are a means of putting pressure on Jordan to have it adopt 
political stands during the current peace process that it cannot 
condone. This method will come to no avail with Jordan. From 
this premise, the government takes great pride in and completely 
supports his majesty's statements yesterday, as well as the 
press statement issued after his Majesty King Husayn met with 
the ambassadors of the five UN Security Council permanent 
members. 
  We have taken note of the reactions, especially by the 
United 
States, and believe these reactions contain positive points that 
could contribute to ending the present problem of the methods 
used in inspecting al-'Aqabah-bound vessels. 
  We emphasize that the government is still waiting for the 
United States and the other concerned parties to make a decision 
expeditiously and without delay in this respect to end this 
problem as soon as possible and to allow the Jordanian economy 
to return to its normal activities and vigor and tackle the 
problems from which it suffers, particularly unemployment and 
poverty. 
  The prohibitive price Jordan has paid could, of course, be 
compensated and Jordan should call for such compensation. 
  The second point I wish to speak about today, and which is 
connected to this, is that the Jordanian Government, or the 
Council of Ministers reviewed today the violence in the occupied 
territories, particularly the massacre that took place in 
Jabaliyah camp in Gaza yesterday, martyring eight Palestinians. 
We believe that the continuation of violence in the West Bank 
and the Gaza Strip proves that Israel until now still prefers to 
resort to military methods. This massacre has taken place two 
days before Land Day. As you know, Land Day falls tomorrow. 
This day reminds us all of the arbitrary measures the Israeli 
authorities carry out in a manner that conflicts with the 
atmosphere of peace that should prevail for the attainment of a 
just and comprehensive solution in the region. While it 
denounces the killings, woundings, and persecution operations 
against our people in the occupied Arab territories, the 
Jordanian Government would like too to celebrate Land Day 
tomorrow to emphasize that peace cannot be attained unless all 
the occupied Arab territories, including of course occupied Arab 
Jerusalem, are regained and the Palestinian people are given 
their full rights on their land and national soil. 
  Thus, we also believe that the current pressure on Jordan, 
along with the cases of violence fabricated by the Israeli 
authorities in the Arab territories and the killing of innocent 
people, are both a form of pressure and an expression of will 
that causes us to cast doubt on Israel's intentions toward the 
peace process. Jordan fully insists that a just and honorable 
peace should ultimately prevail. 
  We should also talk about some domestic issues. Today, the 
Council of Ministers reviewed the many reports published in the 
newspapers and the statements by some trade unions accusing the 
Jordanian Government of seeking to weaken or undermine them, and 
similar rumors. The Council of Ministers reviewed this issue. 
  The Jordanian Government wants to emphasize that it 
completely respects the trade unions; it respects their 
organizations, institutions, and individuals. The government 
also appreciates the great role these trade unions are playing 
in the service of the Jordanian community. We also take pride 
in the achievements of engineers, doctors, pharmacists, 
agricultural engineers, geologists, dentists, journalists, and 
other trade union members who serve the Jordanian community. 
This, however, does not mean that differences can never arise 
between a trade union and various ministries or government 
bodies. This state, which enforces the law and has 
self-respect, acts with methods approved by the Jordanian law 
and constitution. 
  In light of the fact that some trade unions have very large 
memberships and important members, we expect these trade unions 
to play their role in building the community together with the 
government. Differences of views or interpretations does not 
mean that democracy, God forbid, is endangered. On the 
contrary, we want to consolidate the trade union's role and wish 
to grant a very profile value to this role in building the 
community, especially since we are talking about a young 
community that needs all its capabilities to build itself and 
face future challenges. 
  Thus, the government does not have differences with the 
trade 
unions, and does not want to belittle the trade union's 
importance, God forbid. Moreover, it does not want to subject 
these trade unions to anything. However, in the event of 
differences with the trade unions, we will resort to the lawful 
methods approved by the constitution and law. This can occur at 
any time. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Arab towns and villages in Israel hold a 
general strike today to mark Land Day. Security forces and 
police are out in force today to prevent disturbances. Leaders 
of the Israeli Arab community have promised Police Minister 
Moshe Shahal and senior police officers that they will work to 
ensure quiet during the many rallies scheduled. More from 
reporter Dani Gur-Arye: 
  [Begin recording] The day each year in which Israeli Arabs 
protest government confiscation of land will be marked this year 
in the shadow of the Hebron massacre and recent incidents in the 
territories. For the first time in years shops, schools, and 
public offices will be closed throughout the Arab sector. 
Rallies are expected in the main cities and towns. Police are 
hoping the demonstrations will be held quietly, but are prepared 
to deal with disturbances. Arab leaders have asked the public 
to refrain from outbursts of violence. [passage omitted] 
  On March 30 18 years ago policemen opened fire on Arabs 
demonstrating against confiscation of land. Six Israeli Arabs 
were killed. This year Police Minister Moshe Shahal says police 
will concentrate on safeguarding the main roads, but will not 
enter the population centers. The main rally will be held this 
afternoon for the first time in the Bedouin town of Rahat. A 
month ago police shot dead a youth in Rahat in the riots 
following the Hebron massacre. Both sides are hoping to avoid 
similar incidents today. [end recording] 
  In the territories as well, security forces are on alert to 
prevent trouble on Land Day. A Qol Yisra'el reporter says the 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] plans to keep forces away from 
Palestinian population centers, to prevent unnecessary friction, 
and to avoid as much as possible any casualties. At the same 
time the Army will be out in force along major access routes.

<F P=106> ["Sidelines" column: "Double Containment: Obvious U.S. </F>
Fallacies" by Sabri Hammadi] 
  [Text] The article U.S. national security adviser Anthony 
Lake wrote for FOREIGN AFFAIRS magazine contains many obvious 
political deceptions and fallacies. It is easy for any observer 
to diagnose, refute, and expose their suspect aims. This 
article is a modest attempt in that direction. 
  After saying that "the strategy and principles of U.S. 
policy 
in the Gulf are based on establishing a balance of forces in the 
region with the aim of protecting U.S.interests," U.S. national 
security adviser Lake speaks about an endeavor by the U.S. 
Administration and its regional allies to maintain the balance 
in the region without Iraq and Iran. He believes several 
factors that did not exist before have helped the U.S. 
Administration pursue this policy. He then speaks about "the 
removal of the strategic consideration" from U.S. calculations 
with the end of Cold War and says: "The strategic importance of 
both Iraq and Iran has dropped dramatically"! 
  More than that, the U.S. national security adviser goes on 
to 
say: "The general trend in the area is positive and Washington 
enjoys the support of basic forces in it, such as Egypt, 
`Israel,' Turkey, and Saudi Arabia." He adds that progress in 
the "peace" process has contributed toward strengthening the 
U.S. position in the Arab World! 
  It is very clear that Anthony Lake is expressing wishes 
rather than stating facts and realities. He says things the way 
he and his administration like to see them, not as they are in 
reality. 
  The U.S. Administration's endeavor to maintain a balance in 
the region with the cooperation of its regional allies without 
Iraq is a complete failure. What the region has witnessed over 
the past three years has clearly shown it is suffering from a 
flaw in the balance of power due to the absence of Iraqi power. 
This flaw from which the region is suffering has expressed 
itself in more than one occasion and event: Foremost was Iran's 
occupation of the UAE island of Abu Musa and Saudi Arabia's 
attack on the Qatari post of al-Khufus, in addition to other 
tangible manifestations. 
  The U.S. national security adviser tells his biggest lie 
when 
he claims that "the general trend in the region is positive." 
The fact that neither he nor his master Clinton can ignore is 
that the general trend in the region is neither positive nor in 
the interest of the United States; in fact, it is hostile to it. 
  Therefore, when he says that "Washington enjoys the support 
of basic forces in the region such as Egypt, 'Israel,' Turkey, 
and Saudi Arabia" he is playing with words and not telling the 
whole truth. These states enjoy clear and effective U.S. 
political, financial, and military support. In fact, some of 
them have become a burden to the United States because of their 
financial needs and political and security problems! 
  And when he speaks about "progress in the peace process," 
which has helped strengthen their position in the Arab World, he 
is only deceiving himself, and perhaps his administration, by 
such talk. For there has been no real progress so far in what he 
terms "the peace process." And, in addition to U.S. partiality 
toward the Zionist entity, a partiality preventing the 
achievement of any progress, an Arab conviction is growing day 
after day that the Arab regimes taking part in the "peace 
process" have not received anything for their involvement from 
"Israel" or the U.S. Administration. 
  The great fallacy of the U.S. national security adviser is 
his statement that "the strategic importance of both Iraq and 
Iran has dropped dramatically," because political and strategic 
facts cannot be changed or wished away. Nobody can create 
political or strategic facts that do not exist. If Iraq's 
strategic importance has "dropped," as he claims, has the 
strategic importance of any Gulf state, of limited resources and 
capabilities, increased even if it is an ally of the United 
States?! 
  And, when Lake says "it is not strange to renew the 
sanctions 
on Iraq every 60 days without a debate" he is talking about the 
past rather than the present or future. What happened during 
the periodic review of the blockade on Iraq a few days ago 
confirms that what the U.S. national security adviser says is 
absolutely not true. There were debates and differences over the 
issuance of a statement renewing the blockade. Chinese, 
Russian, and French viewpoints conflicted with the viewpoint of 
the United States concerning the extension decision. In fact, 
it was clear that a split had occurred in the Security Council 
over the renewal of the blockade on Iraq. 
  It remains to be said that the current U.S. Administration 
does not define its aims and means in the Gulf in light of the 
real U.S. interests, but is defining them under the influence 
and pressure of the Zionist lobby on the U.S. decision maker. 
What the U.S. national security adviser cannot say is that the 
Zionist factor plays a decisive role now in determining the aims 
and means of U.S. policy in the region, and that this Zionist 
factor stands behind all this U.S. hatred and hostility to Iraq.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Sima Qadmon </F>
at the Knesset on 23 March] 
  [Excerpts] [Qadmon] Sir, had you known eight months ago 
what you know today, would you have started the whole peace 
process? 
  [Rabin] [passage omitted] I knew peace had Israeli enemies. 
I 
found it very hard to believe that an Israeli could commit a 
loathsome crime such as the one committed at the Cave of the 
Patriarchs, but can we say that we ruled it out altogether? 
After all, even today some politically mad person could go to 
some West Bank Arab marketplace, open fire, and kill people. 
There is no certainty that this can be prevented, just as I 
cannot guarantee that a terror squad will not open fire at a bus 
on one of the many roads on which Jews travel. 
  At the time, I made a distinction between political and 
security settlements. The political settlements were set up in 
the heart of Judaea and Samaria, and the issue of providing 
security for the residents was not considered. They did not set 
up clusters of settlements such as the Qatif Bloc. The 
settlements are isolated, and in between them and on the roads 
there are Arab settlements. The Army escorts settler children to 
and from school, making 700 such escorts a day. A large part of 
the Army is tied down in guarding installations, routes, and 
escorting busses, instead of fighting terrorism. The only basic 
solution to this reality, if there is basic solution, is a 
political solution backed up with military might. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Qadmon] Let us discuss one thing you may regret -- the 
Shamgar Commission of Inquiry. 
  [Rabin] The commission exists and is made up of very 
distinguished members. It was set up by a government decision 
that I supported. I have a lot of respect for its work, despite 
the difficulties it adds to the work of Army commanders in the 
field. Naturally, they will consult legal advisers more than in 
the past, which may be good. I believe I will be called to 
testify before the committee, and I believe it is my duty to do 
so. 
  [Qadmon] But you opposed it. Why did you surrender if you 
believed that it would cause damage? 
  [Rabin] I thought that since such an offer was raised at the 
cabinet, and since it had support, it would be a mistake to 
bring it up for a vote. This would have started a public debate 
on whether or not to establish a committee. I do not fear the 
committee. Today, it exists. I am certain its distinguished 
members, mainly its chairman, will study the case, investigate 
it, and issue conclusions that will be recommendations for the 
government. 
  [Qadmon] Did you not say the committee would cause damage 
to the Israel Defense Forces [IDF]? 
  [Rabin] I never said that. In general, the press often 
carries quotes that are very far from the truth. What I said 
was that the committee would impose an additional burden on the 
work of IDF officers and others. They are preoccupied with the 
investigation, and each one fears for himself, mainly those 
directly involved. This is a very complex and sensitive matter. 
For the 1.8 million Palestinians living in the territories, we 
are an occupying army, an occupying government. On the one 
hand, we should provide for the security of that population; on 
the other hand, in their mind, we are an occupying force. As 
such, under international law, we should run life in the 
territories, Jewish as well as Arab. 
  This is a very complex situation, further complicated by the 
political settlements. It is also complex from the aspect of 
security because it has created thousands spots of daily 
friction on the roads and in places where the two populations 
work together. Naturally, when emotions run high, there is no 
end to the areas of contact, friction, and possible 
confrontations of all kinds. Sometimes these things occur in the 
background of some incident, certainly in the wake of the Hebron 
massacre. This time, people who are not members of terror 
groups, swept up by national-religious-fundamentalist-Islamic 
zeal pull out knives and stab others. Since September, we have 
prepared for Jewish riots. Nevertheless, since this issue will 
be examined by the committee, please understand that I cannot 
elaborate. 
  [Qadmon] And yet, the commission found there is an order 
prohibiting soldiers from shooting at settlers under any 
circumstances. 
  [Rabin] I will not comment on that. This issue is being 
investigated by the commission. It remains to be seen in what 
context the order was issued and what orders are being referred 
to. Because this is what the state commission of inquiry is 
working on, I believe that it would be inappropriate for me to 
comment on this question in an open interview. [passage omitted] 
  [Qadmon] Is the five-year long interim period necessary? 
Why should Goldsteins in both camps be given five more years to 
attempt to blow up the entire enterprise? After all, at the end 
of that period we are expecting a Palestinian state. 
  [Rabin] We will make no progress without the interim period. 
The main achievement of the Declaration of Principles is the 
following: The issue of Jerusalem will not be dealt with during 
that period, and the opposition can chatter as much as it likes. 
No country in the world has recognized the unification of 
Jerusalem, but that has never prevented an Israeli Government 
from viewing united Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty as the 
capital of the Jewish nation. Our problem is how to provide 
freedom of worship for other religions as well. To me, this is 
the Jewish test of the State of Israel. Not only guarding the 
integrity of Jerusalem, but also being tolerant to worshipers of 
other religions who really need Jerusalem to perform their 
religious rites. 
  The second thing is maintaining the settlements, not 
uprooting them. The third, is the IDF's overall responsibility 
for the security of Israelis on the roads and in the 
settlements. The fourth thing is responsibility over external 
security along the Jordan River, international border with 
Egypt, and in the area between Nitzana and the Gaza Strip. If 
we have to deal with solving these problems without first 
creating a different reality -- without making the Palestinians 
realize what it means to be in charge of the fate of 1.5 million 
Palestinians, provide them with food, labor, housing, health, 
and education -- it would not have been possible. There is no 
doubt in my mind that this is what we should hope for -- 
creating a new reality that would facilitate dealing with a 
solution no later than two years after the implementation of 
Gaza and Jericho First. 
  [Qadmon] But a Palestinian state will still be waiting at 
the end of the five years, will it not? 
  [Rabin] Who said so? I do not want to deal with the 
solution to that now. I am against the establishment of a 
sovereign, independent Palestinian state west of Jordan. We 
will complete the agreement on Gaza and Jericho and secure its 
implementation and the next stage. This is very important: both 
reaching an agreement as well as implementing it. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Pollard Rejection"] </F>
  [Text] It is both tragic and ironic that the recent arrest 
of CIA spy Aldrich Ames, which should have made it easier for 
President Bill Clinton to pardon Jonathan Pollard, actually 
played an apparently decisive role in preventing his release. 
What seems to have affected Clinton's decision most is the kind 
of message a clemency for Pollard would send at this time. In 
the eyes of the public, there is little difference between 
spies. And showing leniency for one spy immediately after 
another is apprehended -- with the possibility that still others 
are operating -- would probably be an unpopular move. Being 
under fire himself, Clinton must have felt that he was in no 
position to make such a move. 
  Yet on merit the Ames case should have worked in Pollard's 
favor. It has made clear that the nasty innuendoes about Pollard 
selling Israel material that was then conveyed to the Soviet 
Union by Communist moles here were baseless. And the charges 
that he may have caused the death of American agents in the USSR 
are even more unreasonable. With the Soviets having a CIA mole 
in charge of U.S. agents in the USSR, any other information 
about American operations in the Soviet Union -- something 
Pollard had little reason to be interested in anyway -- was 
rendered superfluous. The recent charges that Pollard, in 
isolation almost throughout his stay in prison, managed to 
transmit even more secrets to Israel after his arrest are simply 
ludicrous. 
  Nor does it make sense to say, as CIA chief James Woolsey 
did 
in explaining why he opposed the clemency, that it makes little 
difference whether the spy worked for a friendly country of for 
the U.S.'s most dangerous enemy. It is traditional and 
customary, and perfectly logical, to treat spies for friendly 
countries leniently. In most cases they serve relatively light 
sentences. The U.S. has treated such spies very differently 
from the way it has treated Pollard. And Israel has been 
remarkably lenient with American spies. 
  Yet the intelligence establishment in the U.S. seems to 
believe Pollard deserves life in prison, the maximum punishment 
in peace time. It is the kind of punishment usually reserved 
for the Ameses of this world, the traitors who sell secret 
information to America's most implacable enemy. Unlike Pollard, 
Ames endangered the U.S. and caused the death of at least 10 
American agents. But in what can only be called a travesty of 
justice, Ames's sentence will be no heavier than Pollard's. 
  The existence of this double standard can only be explained 
by a prevailing antagonism toward Israel in some parts of the 
American government. Why it exists is not quite comprehensible. 
None of the pat explanations is satisfactory. One can only 
hope now that it will not be long before another opportunity to 
appeal to the president will arise, and that the circumstances 
will be more conducive to clemency. Pollard has suffered enough.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpts] The powers of the Palestinian urban police 
force to be set up in Hebron will be decided unilaterally by 
Israel and will be made public in an order issued by the town's 
military governor following the signing of the agreement with 
the PLO on the establishment of the police force. The 
governor's order will detail the structure and tasks of the 
urban police and the locations where they will be stationed. 
  In talks between Israel and the PLO it was agreed that the 
source of authority for Hebron's urban police will be the order 
of the Israeli governor, who is the sovereign in the area. 
Israel will not discuss the details of the powers with the PLO. 
  The urban police will safeguard a limited number of 
Palestinian public structures, and according to Israeli sources, 
it will mainly have a symbolic role. 
  The Israeli intention is to have the Palestinian police 
located at sites which are currently not guarded by the Israeli 
security forces. In addition, there will be joint patrols by 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the Palestinian police. 
  The Hebron police will not have any authority over Jewish 
settlers in the town, just as the Palestinian police in Gaza and 
Jericho will not have powers and responsibilities over the 
Israeli settlers in those areas; their security will continue to 
remain the responsibility of Israel even after the autonomy is 
set up. 
  At a gathering in Cairo last Thursday of donor states to the 
Palestinian police force, it transpired that the various states 
promised to contribute equipment and train the police, but that 
the Palestinians are suffering from serious shortages in funds. 
[passage omitted] 
  Israel called on the PLO to present a list at the next 
meeting detailing its requirements for funds, equipment, and 
training for the Palestinian police force. Israel offered 
assistance in making up the list. 
  [Tel Aviv MA'ARIV in Hebrew on 29 March in a related report 
by Hemi Shalev on page 2 says: "Despite Israel's declared aim 
to reach an agreement before 13 April, at yesterday's 
consultations at the Defense Ministry participants assessed that 
it will be impossible to complete the deliberations in less than 
four to six weeks. Sources said after the consultations that 
Israel will show flexibility with Palestinian demands to 
increase the policing force to 100 observers and some 150 
Palestinians. Israel is not opposed in principle to the 
Palestinian demand that observers from another country in 
addition to Norway be deployed, but will not agree to observers 
from Egypt, Russia, or the United States being stationed there."]

<F P=106> [Commentary by 'Oded Granot: "The Glue Is Beginning to Come </F>
Unstuck"] 
  [Text] The Arab countries managed to rally around the 
pronouncement that Israel is the Arab nation's staunchest enemy 
for 50 years, until something happened in Cairo yesterday: For 
the first time in the history of the Arab League, the foreign 
ministers decided that henceforth each country would identify 
its own enemy. 
  This does not mean that the Arab League's friend-or-foe 
detection system went haywire or felt a sudden surge of love 
toward Israel, but it is yet another indication of the collapse 
of inter-Arab solidarity. 
  The Gulf war blew Arab unity to smithereens. The 
disagreements among the Arab countries worsened in the wake of 
that war and became more acute as a result of the absence of a 
charismatic and influential Arab leader. For years hostility 
toward Israel was the only glue that kept all their conflicting 
interests together, and now that glue is beginning to come 
unstuck. 
  Not so much because of our beautiful eyes but because of 
interests: The Syrians see a chance of getting back the Golan 
Heights in the context of a peace arrangement and play down 
their outrage in reaction to the Hebron massacre; 'Arafat sees a 
rapid implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement as the only 
chance for his survival; the Gulf states see no reason not to do 
business with Israel at a time when the "direct confrontation 
states" -- Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon -- sit around the table to 
negotiate with Israeli representatives. 
  Although this is a welcome shift, one should not indulge in 
illusions. It is still a long way between inter-Arab 
disagreement over the definition of Israel as "the common enemy" 
and accepting Israel as an observer in the Arab League. A 
decrease in hostility toward Israel definitely hinges on the 
rate of progress in the peace process.

  [Text] Prague, March 29 (CTK) -- It would not be wise for 
the Czech Republic to be faced unintentionally with the whole of 
the Islam world at a time when the large European countries were 
taking clear steps to moderate the situation surrounding Salman 
Rushdie's "Satanic Verses," spokesman of the Iranian Embassy in 
Prague Mohammad Djoneidi said today. 
  The Iranian embassy was reacting to the news that the Cesty 
publishing house intends to publish a Czech translation of "The 
Satanic Verses." 
  In an interview for NOVA television, a transcript of which 
the Iranian embassy gave CTK, Djoneidi said that the publication 
of Rushdie's controversial book in the Czech Republic was not 
yet definite. He also said he did not believe the Czech 
Government inclined towards damaging good relations with Islamic 
countries. Relations between the Czech Republic and Iran were 
good, he said, and were expanding in all directions. 
  Asked about Iran's response to the possible publication of 
the book in the Czech Republic, Djoneidi pointed to the official 
stance of the Iranian Government, according to which the work is 
politically motivated blasphemy against Islam and Muslims. 
  "The publication of such an insultive book is not 
acceptable, 
but the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran will not take 
any measure to cause violation of international law, practice 
and any other internationally recognized norms," Djoneidi said. 
  The translation and publication of "The Satanic Verses" is 
"the most outrageous act against Islam and Muslims all over the 
world, he said, adding that the book had been banned in many 
non-Islamic countries as well as Islamic ones, because it had 
been "recognized to be contrary to well known freedom 
principles." When the book was regarded as blasphemous by more 
than a billion Muslims throughout the world, it was an "obvious 
act of violation against the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights as well." 
  Another publication of the book, Djoneidi said, could only 
help "flame up the wickedness of the author and policies 
oriented against Islamic countries." 
  "Such an assault on Islamic values could certainly endanger 
world peace and security, and, of course, the responsibility for 
any possible backfire would lie with the assaulters," the 
Iranian spokesman said. 
  Asked by NOVA whether the death penalty was the only 
punishment with which the writer and any publishers were faced, 
or whether it could be substituted by other penalties, such as a 
financial one, Djoneidi also stressed that the religious decree 
(fatwa) which had been issued by the highest Iranian religious 
authorities was out of the reach of the government.

<F P=106> [Report by Raja' Mansur from Nicosia: "Tehran Expects </F>
Important Changes in Baghdad Within Months. Iranian Scheme To 
Partition Iraq. The Iranian Intelligence Services Prepare 
Terrorist Cells From the Iraqi Opposition, Distribute Them Among 
European States;" date not given--all names as transliterated] 
  [Text] Three years after Operation Desert Storm, Iraq's 
future is still "at a precarious position." Some observers 
expect that Saddam Husayn will remain the head of a country that 
is militarily destroyed, politically isolated, and economically 
besieged. Meanwhile, others await the toppling of Saddam through 
a military coup or a popular revolution. 
  A surprising analysis, however, comes from Tehran, where the 
mullahs expect serious changes in the next few months that will 
partition Iraq. Hence, Iran is preparing to gain the "lion's 
share" of "Saddam's heritage." Iran has prepared a 
comprehensive scheme to exploit the new situation by adopting, 
supporting, and entrusting opposition Shiite factions with 
military and terrorist missions in and outside Iraq. AL-WATAN 
AL-'ARABI reveals the details of the Iranian scheme designed to 
use Iraq's Shiites in the partition scenario, which includes 
Baghdad, Beirut, and European capitals. 
  At the beginning of February, the Iranian Higher National 
Security Council, the highest political and military authority 
in Iran, held a top secret meeting devoted to discussing an 
important report prepared by the foreign intelligence service 
led by 'Ali Fallahian in cooperation with the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. This security-political report was devoted to 
future Iranian-Iraqi relations, particularly the future 
situation in Iraq and its possible repercussions on Iran. 
  This report was prepared in light of secret information 
Tehran received through its diplomatic missions, particularly 
its permanent representative in New York, Kamal Kharrazi, and 
its intelligence offices in several Western capitals concerned 
with what is taking place in Iraq, as well as through its 
embassy in Baghdad. 
  The little information leaking from this meeting says senior 
Iranian officials expressed their conviction that the situation 
in Iraq will see important changes in the coming phase. They 
believe Iraq's future will not remain uncertain indefinitely, 
and that all options are still open, including possibilities of 
internal revolution, military coup, assassination, and 
partition. In this meeting, 'Ali Khamane'i, leader of the 
Islamic revolution, revealed that the situation in Iraq is 
burning under the ashes, and that talk about Saddam Husayn's 
success in controlling the situation may not last long in view 
of the economic problems, social crises, blockade, and popular 
grumbling. 
  Khamene'i added: Any change in Iraq will reflect on the 
situation in Iran. We are interested in Iraq. Consequently, we 
should be ready to consider such change and deal with it before 
it actually takes place. He continued: The policy of double 
containment, which the U.S. Administration reinstated, is only a 
pressure card adopted by the Clinton administration. This card 
is linked to the extent of our ability to contain this U.S. 
threat and to Saddam Husayn's ability to convince the Americans 
to use him as a weapon in order to confront what the powers of 
global arrogance term the Iranian threat, and also to prevent 
the establishment of a Shiite entity in southern Iraq. 
  'Ali Fallahian pointed out that the reports he recently 
received from several big capitals interested in the situation 
in Iraq do not rule out the occurrence of regional changes. 
Some reports even talk about redrawing a new regional map, 
including Iraq's partition, fragmentation, and division into 
several sectarian and ethnic entities. 
  Fallahian added: Naturally, regional and international 
reasons were behind the world's refusal to partition Iraq in the 
wake of the Gulf war. The same reasons are still behind keeping 
Saddam Husayn in power as a guarantor of Iraq's unity. 
  Fallahian continued: But the current situation in Iraq 
cannot remain as it is. Any possible scenario, whether a coup, 
a popular uprising, an assassination, or any other possibility, 
will eventually lead to the breakout of ethnic, sectarian, and 
political conflicts leading to civil war and chaos. Most 
probably, this will lead to partition. Therefore, we should be 
prepared to exploit any future developments in Iraq and use them 
in our interest, especially since such developments will have 
clear effects on us. 
  Informed Iranian sources told AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI that the 
higher authorities in Tehran have for a while been acting as if 
Iraq is heading toward partitioning. The sources add that the 
Iranians want to take a lion's share from the changes that may 
occur in Iraq. Toward this end, they are strengthening their 
relations with the Shiite majority, especially after Iran 
managed to move the Shiite religious authority from al-Najaf to 
Qom. To prove their point, the sources recall a recent 
statement by Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani to KAYHAN, the 
Arabic edition, in which he stressed that Iran, first and 
foremost, has the right to look after the affairs of Muslims in 
Iraq. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI has learned that at the conclusion of the 
Iranian Security Council's meeting, a committee comprising 
political, military, and security experts was entrusted with 
preparing a detailed future working plan to deal with such a 
scenario. This scenario is preferred by Tehran, contrary to 
most Arab and Western capitals, which unfailingly stress their 
rejection of the partitioning of Iraq and their interest in 
having its unity maintained. 
  According to information obtained by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI, the 
Iranians have actually begun preparing a plan to reap the fruits 
of the expected changes in Iraq. Thus, they have intensified 
their contacts with the Iraqi Shia to reinforce their influence 
inside Iraq, especially in the areas with a Shiite majority. 
AL-WATAN AL- 'ARABI has also learned that the Iranian plan 
focuses on organizing the fundamental Iraqi opposition factions 
to use them as a Trojan horse to implement its plan. For weeks, 
there have been disclosures about Iranian practices, activities, 
and intensive contacts with fundamental opposition factions, 
some of which have been briefed on the situation. Reports 
affirm that Iranian Ambassador in Damascus Shaykh Ahmad 'Ali 
Akhtari recently met with Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, head of the 
Supreme Assembly of Islamic Revolution in Iraq, and told him 
explicitly that important changes will happen in Iraq within the 
next few months. He told him that the international changes 
will eventually arrive in Iraq, which will be divided in 
accordance with a confederation system after international 
troops are sent into it. He also told him that many regions in 
Iraq will become autonomous. 
  Information obtained by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI from very 
reliable 
sources in Tehran says that officials from the "Liberation 
Movements Bureau," which is headed by Iranian 'Ali A'qal 
Mohammadi, head of the Iraq Affairs Center, began to prepare 
plans for bolstering the position of the Iraqi opposition, 
especially the fundamental opposition, both inside and outside 
Iraq. According to this plan, action cells will set up in Iraq, 
and they will be ready to intervene when the zero hour arrives. 
As for foreign action, Iraqi opposition elements will be 
recruited. They will be linked with the terrorist cells 
affiliated with the Liberation Movements Bureau and foreign 
intelligence. They will work to strike at Iraqi interests, 
embassies, and institutions in a number of European countries. 
They will also carry out assassinations. 
  The plan calls for seeking the help of a large number of 
Iraqi opposition elements residing in Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and 
some Arab countries. They will be urged to travel to Sweden, 
Britain, Denmark, Italy, France, Cyprus, and other countries. 
  Iranian embassies in these countries will get in touch with 
Iraqi opposition groups and terrorist cells and organize their 
activities and plans and establish their objectives. It was 
learned that the Iranian embassies will issue Iraqis with forged 
passports and equipment suited to their operations. These 
embassies will provide information and details about movements 
of Iraqi diplomats and mission staff. 
  It seems the Iranian authorities are anxious not to raise 
suspicion that they are directing these operations. It was 
noticed that their activities and contacts with the 
fundamentalist Iraqi opposition have, for some weeks, focused on 
Lebanon. In fact, the Lebanese security agencies have been 
surprised by the strength of the Iraqi fundamentalist presence 
on Lebanese territory and the increased activity of Iraqi 
fundamentalists. 
  Some reports speak of intensive meetings by Iraqi 
fundamentalists in the central al-Biqa' region chaired by an 
Iraqi called Abu- Haydar. According to information obtained 
from security sources, the al-Biqa' meetings are preparatory. 
They represent one of a series of intensive, secret sessions 
that take place in the Iraqi opposition office in the southern 
suburb of Beirut, chaired by Abu-Maysam, the Da'wah Party 
representative in Lebanon. The reports mention the name of 
another Iraqi called Fakhir, who was charged with providing 
forged Iranian, Kuwaiti, and Bahraini passports for a large 
number of the Iraqi opposition members, some of whom actually 
began travelling to a number of European nations. 
  It was learned that this official holds meetings for Iraqis 
in Bi'r al-'Abd in the southern suburb of Beirut. The 
information indicates that the external Iranian intelligence 
services began cementing their links with elements of the Iraqi 
opposition some time ago. For instance, in the German city of 
Aachen, Iraqi opposition elements have joined hands with Iranian 
intelligence presonnel to launch an Arab language daily under 
the name of AL-JIHAD for distribution among Iraqi, other Arab, 
and Islamic communities in Germany. A version of the paper 
printed in Tehran arrives in Lebanon where it is distributed 
among Muslim and revolutionary extremists. 
  Lebanese security agencies recently noticed that Hizballah 
has been tightening its ties with Iraqi fundamentalists, 
sponsoring their operations. It has been learned that financial 
remittances have been transferred in the past few weeks from 
Iran to a number of Iraqi opposition members stationed in Syria 
and Lebanon to finance their activities and moves. According to 
some reports, the Iraqi Affairs Bureau in Tehran has requested 
additional funds from the Iranian Foreign Ministry's 
intelligence section to meet potentially increasing foreign 
operations. 
  The Iranian project to organize opposition Iraqi factions 
calls for merging the Iraqi organizations and fundamentalist 
parties in an expanded front led by Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, 
president of the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in 
Iraq. The front is supposed to have a secretariat, committees, 
general secretariat, and a central shura council. It was 
learned that the front would incorporate some Iraqi Kurdish 
factions. 
  These are some of the Islamic forces that could join the 
expanded front: 
  1. SAIRI, which is headed by Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim. 
  2. The Iraqi Islamic Movement, represented by Shaykh 'Ali 
'Abd- al-'Aziz. 
  3. The Iraqi Islamic Grouping, represented by Hojjat 
ol-Eslam Muhammad Bahr al-'Ulum. 
  4. The Islamic al-Da'wah Party, represented by 
'Abd-al-Hamid Kashani. 
  5. The Islamic Action Organization, headed by Hojjat 
ol-Eslam Muhammad Taqi Mudaressi. Ayatollah Taghi will 
represent the organization. 
  6. The Imam Soldiers Movement led by Sami al-Badri. 
  7. The Islamic Movement in Iraq led by Shaykh Jawad 
al-Khalis. The Islamic Scholars Organization in Iraq, 
represented by Hojjjat ol-Eslam Muhammad Baqir al-Naseri. 
  The following are some of Kurdish organizations that could 
join the expanded front: 
  1. The Kurdistan People's Democratic Party, led by Sami 
'Abd-al- Rahman. 
  2. The Kurdistan Socialist Party, led by Rasul Mamand. 
  The Iranians seek to hold negotiations with Sa'd Salih Jabr, 
leader of the Free Iraqi Council which was formed in the United 
Kingdom during the Gulf war. However, Jabr so far has refused 
this Iranian proposal saying it serves the Persian aspirations 
in the Arab region and conflicts with the Council's objectives. 
  This heightened Iranian interest in the Iraqi opposition's 
activities has raised many questions among large sectors of the 
Iraqi opposition, including some fundamentalists. In the past, 
the Iraqi fundamentalist opposition faced some harassment in 
Tehran and at times has been explicitly told to look for another 
refuge country. The Iraqi opposition in Iran has often feared 
that Tehran would conclude a deal with the Iraqi regime at its 
expense by sacrificing it for the Mojahedin-e-Khalq which 
Baghdad sponsors. Actually, the Iranian authorities had in the 
past moved many Iraqi opposition members to Lebanon. But, it 
seems that Tehran has found a new and important role for the 
Iraqi fundamentalist opposition to play. Thus, it began getting 
closer to it and emphasizing it is ready to fulfill all its 
demands. 
  Observers believe that Iran, which originally was not ready 
to give up this Iraqi opposition without exacting a price for it 
from Baghdad--which could at a minimum be Rajavi's head--is now 
more ready to placate this opposition as a card that Iran can 
use in its as yet ambiguous plan unless the Iranian rulers 
already have secret components which are part of some deal. 
The coming months will reveal how the Iranian regime plans to 
use the Iraqi opposition.

<F P=106> [Article by Francois Soudan: "The End of Prehistory"] </F>
  [Text] Morocco. Three months from now, the press, radio, 
and television are expected finally to get legal protections 
appropriate for contemporary media. But much remains to be done 
in the economic, social, and professional domains.... 
  Three months from now, if all goes as expected, Morocco's 
parliament will be asked to put an end to an anomaly that has 
persisted for half a century. More specifically, in April the 
very obsolete "dahir" [statue] that has regulated journalists' 
status and governed their professional conduct since the era of 
the French protectorate is to be abrogated and replaced. For the 
thousand or so Moroccan journalists working at the two 
television stations, two national radio stations, and some 400 
newspapers and periodicals, the end of prehistory is thus in 
sight, since their status will be fully recognized in the law, 
if not fully in practice. 
  Over the last year, the commission established in March 1993 
to follow up on the National Colloquium on Information and 
Communication has elaborated a series of legislative bills to be 
submitted to the deputies for approval. Among the bills (none 
has yet been made public) is the new statute on professional 
journalists, destined to replace the 1942 "dahir." 
  A boiler-plate statute, it extends freedom of information 
protection to professional journalists who have been issued a 
special card by the joint commission. Most importantly, it 
stipulates in Article 2 that "journalists have right of access 
to sources of information," a provision that thus formulated 
almost amounts to a small revolution: Investigative journalism 
traditionally has been considered tantamount to espionage. 
  Another bill is supposed to replace the "dahir" decreed in 
1940 "in the French zone of the Moroccan empire" limiting 
activities of film crews and photographers. Under the new bill, 
"taking of photographs is not regulated or subject to any prior 
administrative formalities." 
  No more police interference or confiscation of film on the 
pretext the subject being photographed was of "strategic 
significance." With respect to film takes for television, the 
obligation to submit beforehand a detailed description of each 
shot and afterward allow authorities to view the footage is 
replaced by simple prior accreditation. 
  In addition to creation of a National Media Observatory (to 
be responsible among other things for public opinion polls), 
changes are expected to include appointment of press attaches in 
each ministry, restructuring of the Advanced Institute of 
Journalism in Rabat, and establishment of a High Council on 
Information--a body of "wise men" with advisory powers. The only 
point of contention: its composition. It is not yet clear 
whether the final make-up of the Council will be very restricted 
(10 to 15 members, jurists and academics) or enlarged to include 
representatives of journalists' unions and newspaper management. 
<H5>  Social Malaise </H5>
  But important as it is, this updating and modernization of 
the laws should not obscure the fact that taken as a whole 
Morocco's media establishment--especially the written press--is 
far from flourishing. Out of 406 registered 
publications--two-thirds of them in the Arabic language, mostly 
specialized and trade journals--very few pay their employees 
adequately or regularly. The malaise is thus first of all social 
in nature, and the scope of the problem went unrecognized until 
three well-known journalists died in abject poverty in 1993. 
  But there are also structural problems. In a document 
prepared for the National Colloquium on Information, Jamal 
Eddine Naji, a journalism teacher and member of the Moroccan 
Human Rights Organization, drew up a list of these dysfunctions: 
the precarious financial condition of newspapers, the small size 
of the advertising market, the weakness of editorial staffs, 
absence of training, total lack of knowledge about the 
readership.... The absence of any means of monitoring sales and 
circulation only adds to the impression of disorder. Of course, 
we know that during the Gulf war and the rape trial of 
commissioner Tabet, the dailies had record press runs--up to 
200,000 copies. But do the figures announced in normal times 
(100,000 for LE MATIN, 80,000 for AL-ITTIHAD AL-ICHTIRAKI, 
50,000 for L'OPINION and AL-ALAM, 30,000 for AL-BAYANE) really 
correspond to circulation? And what are actual sales? 
  Another problem: the poor distribution of Moroccan news 
publications outside Morocco. Whereas LE FIGARO, FRANCE SOIR, 
L'EQUIPE, and ACHARQ AL-AWSAT are printed locally in facsimile, 
and proceeds from sales of foreign newspapers in Morocco amount 
(after conversion and transfer) to $10 million per year, the 
local press is still unable--or barely able--to find readership 
abroad. "The French, Tunisian, and Egyptian markets are much 
more protectionist in this area than our own," newspaper 
executives complain. "In Algeria, it is impossible even to find 
a distributor. In late 1991, one small entrepreneur tried his 
hand at it: The experiment lasted all of three months." 
  One of the most important questions is not even addressed: 
Is 
the Moroccan press able to offer a product sufficiently 
generalized and informative to attract non-Moroccans outside the 
country? Alas, for now the answer must be no. The goodly number 
of party newspapers, including some of real quality, the 
existence of a respectable economic and commercial press, and 
the recent appearance of more hard-hitting weeklies cannot hide 
the lack of a single really independent daily newspaper. The 
readership exists, and so does the investment capital, but no 
one has done more than toy with the possibility. The 
broadcasting sector, although greatly modernized since creation 
of the encrypted 2-M station and radio station Medi-1, seems 
paralyzed by the old taboos whenever it reports on internal 
politics. The result: Events as important as the legislative 
elections of June 1993 and the failed governmental alternation 
have been covered only from a partisan and thus selective slant 
in the press, radio, and television. 
  This lack of objectivity ultimately penalizes the newspapers 
and lays bare their often archaic operating structures. 
Disappointed and weary readers are turning increasingly toward 
journals that offer a greater variety of news and do not shrink 
from scandal; such journals have had unprecedented growth in 
recent years. The pioneers in this domain, Mustapha Alaoui and 
"Ousbou' Assahafi Wa Assiyassi," have been overtaken by former 
cartoonist Mohamed Filali, who today heads a small group of 
three periodicals with press runs totaling close to 700,000. 
What is distinctive about these journals is that they cover 
everything, address interests of all readers (including 
Islamists), and blithely commingle little "scoops" and gross 
rumors. 
  "The government has done much to help the press," says the 
Ministry of Information--"help it become more professional, and 
if necessary help it cope with the chores of management." 
Communist Ali Yata, political party leader and newspaper 
publisher, enthusiastically confirms that "never has the 
Moroccan press made such important advances as those of the last 
few years." 
  That much is probably true. Journalists are getting a 
variety 
of benefits, newspapers are getting subsidies, and even the 
National Press Syndicate, headed by the able Mohamed Larbi 
Messari, is getting assistance. Hassan II dips regularly into 
palace coffers to support dailies regardless of political 
affiliation. Since 1987, the "annual royal gift" of about 20 
million dirhams ($2 million) has been divided into checks 
distributed in a televised ceremony to managing editors of the 
various newspapers. Admittedly, no one exactly knows what 
happens to the money, and journalists, who are asking for a 
little more transparency, would like to see training programs 
get the lion's share. All the same, the gesture is far from 
negligible, and neither are the efforts made by the Ministry of 
Information to improve the circulation of the big national 
dailies. 
<H5>  Vast `Uplift' </H5>
  Perceived as an anomaly, even an archaism, the lumping 
together of the Information and Interior portfolios--for the 
last eight years both have been under the wing of the same 
bicephalous minister, Driss Basri--has been from one standpoint 
paradoxically helpful. A strategic sector, information has been 
beefed up with material and human resources it previously 
lacked, and the minister--who has been quite careful, apart from 
a couple of gaffes, not to be accused of "controlling" the 
journalists--has in general tried to discourage filings of 
numerous court actions against the press by the state or private 
individuals. Everyone agrees, however, that the current 
arrangement is outdated. If the opposition had been included in 
the government that issued from the last legislative elections, 
the two ministries were to have been delinked. For the moment, 
the vast task of "lifting up" the Moroccan media still falls on 
the shoulders of Driss Basri--a man who fervently believes in 
that mission. 
  As for the future of the Information Ministry, almost 
anything is possible: a complete and autonomous ministry, a 
state secretariat, a directorate under the prime minister? 
Increasingly, however, voices are being raised calling for it to 
abolished outright and replaced by a communication agency. That 
would be a proud milestone in the "new deal" for Moroccan 
journalism.

<F P=106> [Article by Michel Rambeau (Syfia): "Euro-Moroccan </F>
Partnership at a Standstill"] 
  [Text] Partnership, association, free-trade zone, 
cooperation? Obviously, Moroccans and Europeans do not have the 
same approach to their joint future. The vice president of the 
European Commission, Mr. Manuel Marin's visit to Rabat in 
mid-December illustrated the differences arising from the 
renegotiation of the Euro-Moroccan cooperation agreement. "We 
expected the Moroccans to have reservations on a number of 
points, but we never expected such a shock," people at the 
Commission pointed out. Actually, Mr. Marin came up against a 
polite but firm "niet" from his Moroccan counterpart, Mr. 
Abdellatif Filali, minister of foreign affairs. The latter said 
that the concessions made by the Europeans to his country, 
especially as far as agriculture is concerned, were markedly 
"inadequate." 
  In fact, the Twelve agreed only to a few improvements of the 
conditions covering Moroccan agricultural exports, providing a 
3-percent annual increase for the first five years of 
application of the agreement, but only for products enjoying 
special access conditions, such as fruit and vegetables which, 
as a result, will have to be "communitized" [considered on a 
community scale]. At present, with 51 percent of imports, France 
remains Morocco's largest European customer. But the Moroccans 
keep recalling that "for the past 10 years, current agreements 
essentially benefited Europe" and that "the trade deficit keeps 
getting worse." From 1987 to 1992, it rose from 350 to 650 
million ECUs [European currency units]. Moroccan exports to the 
former EEC account for only 0.12 percent of all Community 
imports. Sales of citrus fruit and tomatoes have not increased 
since the seventies. 
  According to Mr. Allal Sijelmassi, in charge of bilateral 
relations at the Foreign Trade Ministry, "exchange terms are 
quite out of balance: Morocco no longer expects assistance but 
real partnership and the creation of a free-trade zone." But 
that question was not even discussed. The proposed agreement is 
a mere association agreement, like the one between the twelve 
European countries and East European countries. Morocco rejects 
it; what it wants is to be totally docked to Europe. This in 
spite of the reluctance displayed by Moroccan economic circles, 
who are worried at seeing their markets wide open to European 
industrial and agrifood products. They fear the disappearance of 
entire sectors of their industry and the massive arrival of 
European staple agricultural products (milk, meat, grains) at 
very competitive (because often subsidized) prices. 
<H5>  Internal Resistance </H5>
  To explain this relative failure, people in Brussels stress 
the role played by the government opposition, led by the 
(nationalist) Istiqlal and the (socialist) USFP [Socialist Union 
of Popular Forces], in denouncing this negotiation mandate "that 
brings grist to the mill of Morocco's most conservative pillars, 
including some in the government in particular at the Ministry 
of Interior, although the king and his closest advisors are 
ardent supporters of the agreement." 
  The European negotiators, however, acknowledge that their 
proposals "lacked scope" because they were dictated by the 
recession that is affecting Europe. "As member States have no 
money left and have problems with their agriculture, the 
negotiation could not have come at a worst time," Mrs. Le 
Dantec, one of the Commission's people in charge of the 
negotiation mandate, deplored. The thorny problem of immigration 
also had something to do with the Europeans' reluctance, as part 
of their public opinion is increasingly xenophobic. These delays 
exasperate the Moroccans who feel that they are doing their best 
to no avail. "We pay an exorbitant social cost for the 
structural adjustment program dictated by the IMF, the State and 
agricultural producers are making a constant effort, but in 
recent years the quantities exported per hectare have kept 
decreasing. These ridiculous proposals are no match for the 
challenges of the 21st century," an economist at the Hassan-II 
Institute protested. 
  Faced with Europe's increasing tendency to 
"de-Mediterranize" 
its trade flows (they now account for only 5 percent of all 
European trade) and with the endemic weakness of inter-Maghreb 
trade (6 percent of the global trade volume), Morocco is losing 
patience. And it is distressed at getting so little in return 
for opening its market to investors from the North ($800 million 
projected for 1994, compared with $60 million in 1986). European 
experts, for their part, point out that "this mandate represents 
an important qualitative jump, because it provides a forum for 
political dialogue at the highest level prior to any subsequent 
progress, which also answers the Moroccan's initial request." 
  The access door to Europe is barely half-open. The two 
parties still have two years to find an area of agreement before 
the renegotiation of the agreements linking the two 
Mediterranean shores is completed. The crucial year will be 
1996, with the deadline for the implementation of the PAC 
(common agricultural policy) and the new U.S. farm bill.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Trade: Slight Decline"] </F>
  [Text] The first estimates of Morocco's 1993 global trade 
volume show a decrease of about 0.7 percent, from 96.764 to 96.1 
billion dirhams[DH] . 
  Import figures are expected to decline by 1.1 percent, to 
62.1 billion dirhams in 1993 compared with DH62.805 billion in 
1992, whereas exports should remain stable at DH34 billion. 
  The trade balance deficit should slightly improve, from 
DH28.846 billion in 1992 to 28.1 billion in 1993, i.e., a 
2.6-percent decrease. 
  The rate of coverage of imports by exports should rise from 
54.1 percent in 1992 to 54.8 percent in 1993. 
  The current account balance should show a deficit of DH5.5 
billion, 46.7 percent more than in 1992. Foreign investments 
should account for 90 percent of this deficit financing: they 
are said to amount DHto 4.5 billion, 4.7 percent more than in 
1992. 
  Revenues from subcontracting are said to have increased by 
23.5 percent in 1993, to DH2.9 billion. 
  The balance of payments remains positive, at DH2.75 billion 
dirhams, although the debt rescheduling cycle has ended. 
Actually, the outstanding debt was reduced by 1.2 percent, from 
$21.3 billion in 1992 to $21.05 billion in 1993. 
  Finally, foreign currency reserves should amount to about 
DH36 billion, (a 14.5 percent increase over 1992) representing 
seven months of goods imports, compared with six months last 
year.

<F P=106> [Article by Ko Colijn and Paul Rusman: "Netherlands Army Is </F>
Going To Provide Egypt With Hundreds of Armored Vehicles"] 
  [Text] Pakistan is a problem, but Egypt is all right these 
days. In the past, that is to say about 10 years ago, the export 
of military goods to countries in the Middle East would have met 
with insurmountable problems. This changed somewhat following 
the Egypt-Israeli peace agreement (Camp David). Minesweepers 
were allowed to demonstrate their abilities in Alexandria, top 
military personnel and secretaries of state (Van Houwelingen in 
1985) cautiously tested the market during sneaky trips to the 
Nile. No real weapons were involved: after all, electronics, 
patrol ships and fishing for mines in the Red Sea did serve the 
general interest. In 1988, the Royal Navy also made a call in 
Egypt to once again demonstrate the quality of the Dutch 
bottoms. But Egypt did not have any money. In thanks for 
services rendered during the Gulf war, it received generous 
military assistance from the United States so that it did not 
have to put its scarce resources into Dutch goods. But now a 
small breakthrough is in the offing. It concerns real weapons, 
and the supplier is once again the Dutch Government itself. The 
disarmament race in Europe has led to an enormous surplus of 
weapons. Minister Ter Beek has 727 armored infantry vehicles, 
model YPR-765, for sale. The oldest are only 20 years old, the 
youngest were made in 1987. Now Egypt would like to acquire as 
many as 500 to 600 of them. According to the ministry's sales 
brochure, they should yield between 400,000 and 700,000 guilders 
each, hence a total of something like 250 million guilders. 
According to reports, Pakistan had also expressed interest, but 
the idea of Daf armored vehicles on the front line against India 
was going a bit too far. Even though a war between Egypt and 
Israel is really no longer a matter of consideration, the 
planned sale to Egypt is not uncontroversial. First of all, the 
possibility of an "Iranian" development in Egypt, where 
fundamentalists and the government are fighting hard, is not 
excluded. To deliver to Egypt means more or less lengthy 
military relations with that country (maintenance, reserve 
parts), unless the United States is willing to provide the 
follow up care (even during crises). The willingness to enter 
into military ties with Egypt shows that the Dutch arms export 
policy is in the process of changing. Evenhandedness requires 
that Israel no longer be an undesirable destination either. 
Before you know it, we will have moved from a quasiembargo of 
the Middle East as a "sensitive region" into a policy that comes 
down to calling yourself neutral as long as you supply all 
countries with equal amounts. Countries such as Iran and Iraq 
excluded, of course. The pressure to export becomes even greater 
because the defense budget takes income from future exports into 
account. Now that a large part of the discontinued equipment is 
bad, produces little return, and meanwhile is rusting away, the 
Ministry of Defense cannot afford to miss another major hit in 
the Middle East.

<F P=106> [Article by B. Krimi: "Innovations and Limitations of the </F>
New Investment Incentive Code"] 
  [Text] On 21 December 1993, the Chamber of Deputies adopted 
the new "investment incentive code" and its application texts. 
This new law, filling a legal vacuum that prevented a restart of 
investments (in marked decline in the past two years), proposes 
to provide more consistency, security, and profitability to 
onshore and offshore investments. 
  For this, the new legislation will guarantee investment 
security, mobility, and profitability. Security will be achieved 
by instituting three fundamental freedoms: freedom to invest, 
freedom to transfer profits, and freedom to transfer capital to 
complete the project. Eagerly awaited for at least two years, 
the new code will harmonize in a single text the incentives 
provided by the five previous codes (industry, agriculture, 
services, tourism, and regulations concerning trade and 
international brokerage). 
  From the start, the new code differs from the previous codes 
by its global character, by its perfect adaptability to the 
growth objectives of the eighth plan (1991-1996), and by its 
goals: to rehabilitate business and provide impetus for private 
investment. Roughly, the new code (which does not cover the 
mining, energy, and finance sectors because of their specific 
nature) aims mostly to revive direct foreign investment, to 
provide impetus for local investment, and to link both kinds of 
investment to exports. 
  The sectors concerned are: agriculture and fisheries, 
manufacturing industries, civil engineering, tourism, artisanat, 
transport, education, vocational training, culture-related 
production and industry, youth activities, child welfare, 
health, environmental protection, real estate development, and 
other activities and services specified in the decree. 
<H5>  The Code Contains 6 Innovations </H5>
  First, the code no longer targets sectors, but businesses 
irrespective of the field in which they operate. However, 
special attention is given to agricultural, aquicultural, and 
fishery companies, followed by export companies, decentralized 
businesses, and ecology-related projects. Businesses overlooked, 
or even penalized, by the code will be found in the tourism 
sector. Professionals see in this a deliberate decision on the 
part of the government to slow down investment in that sector. 
  Second, the new code draws up a new list of priority 
activities eligible for tax and financial incentives provided by 
the State. There are seven of them: exports, regional 
development, agriculture, technology transfer, environmental 
protection, incentives for young entrepreneurs to create small 
to midsize businesses or start small trades, and finally 
consolidation or support investment. 
  Third, there are two classes of incentives: common 
incentives 
and specific incentives. The latter will be granted exclusively 
to the above-mentioned priority activities. 
  Fourth, tax and financial incentives provided by the State 
will also extend to the sociocultural environment of the 
production apparatus. Incentives will thus be granted to 
entrepreneurs wishing to invest in ecology, vocational training, 
education, or cultural activities. 
  Fifth, incentives will be granted only to achieve a dual 
goal: to make businesses aware of their responsibilities and to 
encourage them to stop borrowing and to modernize their 
equipment. 
  Sixth, State subsidies and bank interest rate rebates will 
be 
replaced by premiums: a specific premium, and another 
complementary or additional premium. 
<H5>  Three Common Incentives </H5>
  -- Companies and individuals who contribute to the capital 
of 
businesses created in the sectors covered by the code will 
automatically be granted a tax exemption for 35 percent of their 
net taxable revenues or profits. 
  -- Durable goods required for the purpose of the 
investment--with the exception of passenger cars other than 
those intended for Sahara or hunting tourism--will enjoy a 
reduced customs duties rate of 10 percent while taxes of 
equivalent effect, the value-added tax, and the consumption duty 
on imports will be waived provided that equivalent durable goods 
are not available in Tunisia. 
  -- Third tax incentive: businesses may choose to use the 
diminishing values method to depreciate production equipment and 
facilities with a useful life in excess of seven years. Through 
this incentive, the government intends to encourage businesses 
to modernize their facilities and to acquire new technologies. 
According to the code, this provision is not retroactive; 
therefore, it will apply only to equipment and facilities 
acquired after promulgation of this code. As for specific 
incentives, they will be granted to priority activities. 
  Agriculture is the favorite sector of the new incentive 
code. 
Previously granted incentives were consolidated and extended to 
agricultural product processing industries, fisheries, 
packaging, and to the forestry sector.... Premiums will be 
granted directly to farmers as soon as their projects start. 
Seventy percent of the profits and revenues invested as 
contribution to the capital of an agricultural company will be 
tax exempt. 
  Note also that investments in the agricultural sector fall 
into three classes: Class A, investments made by small farmers; 
Class B, investments made by midsize farmers; Class C, 
investments made by large farmers. Class-A and Class-B projects 
will receive two investment premiums, one specific premium and a 
complementary premium, in addition to the common incentives. 
  The specific premium, that farmers [sic] will also receive, 
will be granted solely to finance investment components: 
purchase of agricultural machinery, installation of irrigation 
systems leading to water savings, secondary irrigation for grain 
crops, water and soil preservation work, seed propagation and 
production, creation of ranges and areas for pasture and to 
plant forage and forestry bushes and shrubs. 
  Agricultural investments made in regions with a difficult 
climate, and fishery investments in areas with underdeveloped 
resources may receive an additional premium. Investments made to 
develop areas designed for aquicultural or geothermal projects 
will receive a premium representing the State's payment for 
infrastructure expenditures. 
  As far as exports are concerned, 70 percent of the profits 
and revenues invested as capital contributions will be tax 
exempt, instead of 100 percent previously. Profits generated by 
exports will be 100-percent tax exempt for 10 years, and only 50 
percent after that period. Another incentive: each exporting 
company may recruit four foreign management-level supervisors 
and sell 20 percent of its production on the local market, as 
long as it pays import customs duties. As an exception, 
agricultural and fishery companies will be considered as 
exporting companies if they export 70 percent of their 
production. 
<H5>  Exports and Technology Transfers </H5>
  The code also contains an important innovation: it 
eliminates 
the distinction between fully and partially exporting companies. 
For the first time, regional development will enjoy State tax 
incentives. Materially, investors who choose to operate inland 
will enjoy a full 10-year tax exemption for profits generated by 
investments in industry, tourism, and some services. Note that 
this 100-percent tax exemption will be reduced to 50 percent at 
the expiration of the first 10-year period. 
  Other incentives to regional investment are premiums 
consisting of a State participation in the cost of projects, 
studies, and development work in industrial and tourism areas. 
The State will pay the employer's social security contribution 
for a period of five years. Construction and real-estate 
development companies will enjoy a 50-percent tax exemption if 
they have to provide community facilities. 
  Technology transfer and technological expertise are the 
other 
priorities of the code. The code provides incentives for any 
business taking steps to improve its supervisor ratio 
(recruitment of senior technicians, etc.) and the skills of its 
supervision personnel. 
  For the first time, environmental protection and the fight 
against pollution are entitled to State subsidies/premiums. The 
latter will be granted to businesses that invest in waste and 
garbage processing and treatment. They involve exemption of 
customs duties and taxes of equivalent effect on imported goods 
that have no equivalent in Tunisia and are deemed necessary to 
complete the project. 
  Finally, the institution of tax and financial incentives 
designed to promote support or consolidation investment. The 
objective is to encourage vocational training centers, 
educational institutions, and construction and real-estate 
development companies to invest in activities lying at the 
periphery of the production apparatus (continued education, 
low-rent housing, etc.). 
  The code provides miscellaneous incentives that may be of 
"special interest" for the country's economy or for border 
zones. The additional incentives that may be granted involve tax 
exemption for a period of up to five years, State participation 
in infrastructure expenditures, investment premiums amounting to 
5 percent of the amount invested, and the waiving of duties and 
taxes on facilities required to complete the investments. 
  As a result, the new code is both open and flexible. 
Everything will hinge on direct negotiations between the 
investor and local authorities. All things considered, the code 
offers la carte service. 
<H5>  Reactions of Economic Operators </H5>
  This being said, economic operators as a whole did not react 
well to the new code. They saw it as a net reduction of 
investment incentives. As an indication, operators mention the 
elimination of the bank interest rate rebate, which 
manufacturers prefer to the State investment subsidy or premium, 
and the 10-year limit on the full tax exemption of profits and 
revenues and its reduction to 70 percent of profits of revenues 
instead of 100 percent as previously. 
  We should recognize, however, that Tunisian entrepreneurs, 
used to State subsidies and excited for some time at the 
prospect of getting new incentives under the new code, 
exaggerate a lot when they go so far as to link the restart of 
investment to the institution of zero tax on capital goods and 
duty-free import of passenger cars. 
  For the government, eliminating the (10 percent) customs 
duty 
is unacceptable for a very simple reason: under nondual-taxation 
agreements between Tunisia and its partners, local or 
nonresident entrepreneurs will be liable one way or the other to 
taxes levied by one of the two partner countries. In that case, 
why should Tunisia deprive itself of it? 
  The main objection that can be formulated against the new 
code is that it does not address current mutations and 
requirements. If we are to believe Mr. Ferid Tanfous, foreign 
trade and transfer director at the Central Bank of Tunisia, 
investors are rather more interested in the secondary sector 
(stock market, etc.), hence Tunisia's interest in working 
already now to deregulate investment in the secondary market. It 
is not at all irrelevant to recall here that any purchase of 
stocks and shares on the secondary market is still subject to 
preliminary official approval. 
  In addition, although the new code is intended to be clear 
and easy to understand, it includes very vague "formulations" 
leading to conflicting interpretations. For instance, it is 
punctuated with expressions such as "subject to...," "provided 
that...," "businesses may...." Such expressions, which will be 
defined more precisely in applications texts, indicate that 
enjoying State incentives or premiums is a mere possibility; as 
a result, they may discourage entrepreneurs who, in their 
investment decisions, look first of all for a crystal-clear 
nondiscriminatory legal system. 
  Another limitation or inadequacy of the new code is that the 
new legislation gives too much importance to financial 
incentives and overlooks other parameters that are equally 
important when it comes to improving the competitiveness of 
businesses, namely capital and personnel productivity, continued 
education, total quality, management methods, working 
conditions, etc. 
  To quote the head of the Tunisian employers association, Mr. 
Hedi Jilani, this investment incentive code "is a piece of goods 
designed for local and external consumption. It will be 
evaluated and judged not by the government or even by the 
deputies, but by the market for which it was written."

<F P=106> [By V.K. Madhavan Kutty] </F>
  [Text] Whenever a change takes place in the American 
Administration, especially from Republicans to Democrats, it is 
common practice in the media in India and also to some extent in 
government circles and among politicians to interpret it as a 
change for the good, particularly for Indo-U.S. relations. But 
the experience so far has been to the contrary, the simple 
reason being that the U.S. national interests and their 
perspectives have remained the same. In other words, the U.S. 
Administration never changed its attitudes and perspectives on 
world affairs. It has remained consistent, a fact we can 
overlook only at our own cost. 
  America fashioned its policies, tailored its approaches and 
upheld its values on democracy, human rights and whatever its 
founding fathers prescribed for them to suit their `national 
interests' as Americans perceived them, whether it was Grenada, 
Panama, the Bay of Pigs, Iran and host of other things and even 
on Kashmir. To expect that America will play its role according 
to the rule book is too much. America will even extend a Most 
Favoured Nation treatment even if it is convinced that the 
recipient country violates and defies the basic principles 
America upholds and wants all others to adhere strictly. 
  America never stood by India or anybody else for that 
matter. 
If India drew inspiration from it during our independence 
struggle it was because it suited America's national interest to 
support us at that time. It makes one even to think 
retrospectively that it was in their national interest they 
wanted Britain to withdraw from India so that one day in the 
future they can be the replacement! The subsequent U.S. attitude 
particularly in recent years, more so after the end of cold war 
towards India on Kashmir, our economic development, scientific 
programmes, NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] etc. proves 
this. Perhaps America was in a happier situation when in the 
late 60s one Central Minister with proclaimed socialist leanings 
spoke of `dove-tailing the plan', `India's womb opening up', 
'backseat driving' etc. 
  The doves have turned to hawks and planning is now at the 
dictates of World Bank and IMF. At that time there were 
warnings of the empire trying to come back by the back door. 
Now the suspicion has once again started growing among many 
Indians, thanks to Clinton's pronouncements, Robin Raphel's 
observations and John Mallot's comments. Opening up and 
liberalisation may be necessary in today's global situation but 
it should be in keeping with our national interests and not 
according to imported prescriptions. 
  One score and ten years ago, John Kennedy in his inaugural 
address said that American will "pay any price, bear any burden, 
meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure 
the survival and success of liberty". Thirty years later Bill 
Clinton in his inaugural address proclaimed to protect America's 
"vital interests" and pledged American action when "the will and 
conscience of international community defied" that is to say 
that there will be interventions for reasons of American 
national interests and for reasons of American conscience. 
Recently an American commentator wrote: "It has been a long 
road (for Clinton) from Vietnam: the conscientious objector has 
become the conscientious warrior." He added that it was a 
"breakthrough" but a dangerous one. Even nations like India 
have to pay a "heavy price", bear the burden, meet hardships and 
is forced to support America, oppose their enemies for the 
survival and success of liberty and tolerate interventions 
anywhere if America thinks that their national interests and 
their conscience are affected. 
  The Americans always suffered from some sort of 
psychological 
obsession. During the 50s and 60s especially, it was their 
obsession that they have been entrusted with the responsibility 
to contain communism. In Vietnam and elsewhere they learnt 
bitter lessons. In later years their obsession was to uphold 
human rights and liberty in all parts of the globe and they will 
be the prosecutor and judge at the same time. Assuming this 
role, America serves their national interests today in many 
parts of the world with scant regard for other nations. The 
standard for fundamental values like democracy, human rights are 
set by them, administered by them, judged by them and if they 
find any nation guilty they appropriate the right to themselves 
to punish such nations by interventions and sanctions. 
  In 1971, Indira Gandhi in an article in Foreign Affairs 
wrote 
"....successive U.S. administrations have ignored the fact that 
India must see her problems and her relationship in a different 
perspective. India was regarded with disapproval and resentment 
because of her independent policy. This could not but affect 
relations between India and America. Despite fluctuations of 
mood, our relationship as a whole has been uneasy over long 
period". 
  Today, we are deliberating whether the Prime Minister should 
visit America now or later, whether a minor functionary of the 
American administration should be advised to postpone her visit 
to India or not. What is important is to tell America in the 
language it understands, as Mrs Gandhi did during the Bangladesh 
liberation. Prime Minister Narasimha Rao told the UN Security 
Council Summit last year that countries like India express their 
views but they are seldom heard. Even the UN is hijacked to 
serve the national interests of a particular country. This 
situation has to be, and must be, changed. 
  If the Indo-U.S. relations are to improve, American national 
interests and India's self-respect should go together. "Nations 
are not individuals, nations live in a state of nature. If they 
do not protect themselves they die. Ignoring one's interests, 
squandering one's resources in fits of altruism, is the fast 
road to national destruction", This warning given to America by 
an American equally applies to India.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 19 -- The Clinton Administration' 
move to resume supply of F-16 fighters to Pakistan has cast a 
shadow over Indo-U.S. bilateral discussions starting here next 
week to enhance mutual understanding on several contentious 
issues. 
  The chances of a Prime Ministerial visit to Washington will 
also depend on the outcome of the talks here between Indian 
officials and Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphel from 
Tuesday, and Deputy Secretary of State Strove Talbott in the 
first week of April. 
  The fact that the U.S. is despatching two senior officials 
to 
India within a fortnight has given rise to hope as well as 
apprehensions. There is hope that the Clinton Administration 
may be seriously trying to improve relations and clear up 
misunderstandings arising from certain unfortunate observations 
regarding Kashmir, human rights and the "Sikh rights". At the 
same time there exist apprehensions that the officials may only 
articulate the now-too- familiar stand of the Administration and 
attempt to bring pressure to bear on NPT [Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty], MTCR [Missile Technology Control 
Regime] and other such issues. 
  The Indian side expects the two senior officials to clarify 
the U.S. Administration's stand on all these issues. New 
Delhi's serious concern at the possible supply of more F-16 
aircraft to Pakistan as a "one-time exception" through a 
Congressional waiver of the Pressler Amendment has been voiced 
in strong terms by the Prime Minister, the External Affairs 
Minister and the Chief of Air Staff. Such an act will upset the 
balance of power in the region, escalate the arms race and force 
India to divert more resources to defence to safeguard its 
security. That will not be a friendly act, Ms. Raphel and Mr 
Talbott will be told. 
  A visit by the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, to 
Washington is still in the realm of uncertainty though officials 
on both sides have been talking about it in the hope that an 
Indo-U.S. summit will help clear up the misunderstandings and 
also expand the already strong economic relations between the 
two countries. But the fact remains that no formal invitation 
has so far been extended by the Clinton Administration to Mr Rao 
to visit Washington. This being the case, Indian side does not 
want to give the impression that it is keen on such a visit 
while the Clinton Administration is not or that success of such 
a visit would be ensured if India fell in line as regards the 
U.S. suggestions on NPT, MTCR and Kashmir. 
  The U.S. Secretary of State, Mr Warren Christopher, has 
tried 
to put the issue of Indo-U.S. relations in perspective by 
referring to United States' "great admiration" for India and 
"very high respect" for it. At the same time he has pointed out 
that "as with many friends we have problems with India" on 
issues like nuclear non-proliferation and human rights. The 
Indian side recognises that differences on several issues 
between the world's two largest democracies have persisted over 
the decades and will continue in the future. But observations 
like questioning the legality of Kashmir's accession to India 
and excessive concern for human rights have conveyed the feeling 
that there is a decisive U.S. tilt in favour of Pakistan. 
  Following the passage of the unanimous Parliamentary 
resolution, it is not open to the Indian Government to negotiate 
the status of Kashmir, and the Prime Minister has already said 
that there is no question of a dispute between India and 
Pakistan over Kashmir. Political opinion in the country is also 
sharply divided on the question of India trying to make up with 
the United States regardless of the existing controversies. 
  Many ruling party members feel that the fate of Indo-US 
relations should not hinge on the statements of a few foreign 
office officials, and that the two countries should cooperate 
with each other in economic and other fields. However, another 
section in the party as also in the Opposition, has accused the 
Government of prevaricating in responding to the provocative 
statements made by U.S. officials and by President Clinton 
himself. They feel that the Government should strongly resist 
U.S. interference in India's internal affairs, its encouragement 
to Pakistan which is sponsoring terrorism against India and its 
bolstering Pakistan's strength by resuming the supply of F-16s 
under the pretext of capping its nuclear programme. Although 
Pakistan's former Chief of Army Staff General Aslam Beg is on 
record saying that Islamabad's nuclear programme has already 
been capped, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has recently declared 
categorically that "there is no question of Pakistan capping its 
nuclear programme."

  [Text] The United States has never been a close friend of 
India. At the same time, neither has it displayed any 
animosity. Of late, however, there has been a rapid change in 
the situation. The United States is doing everything possible to 
embarrass India. Why is it so furious against India? The sole 
reason is that, being an international policeman, it thinks that 
India has not become its consummate slave. Moreover, India's 
progress in South Asia as well as its overall development, which 
befits a global superpower, also irritates the United States. 
  Right from the Nehru era, only the Soviet Union maintained a 
close friendship and gave protection to India. The United 
States was unhappy with India as it was leaning toward the 
Soviet Union when both the Soviet Union and the United States 
were superpowers. Therefore, whoever became U.S. president, he 
maintained a moderate level of friendship with India. They 
never provoked India unnecessarily. Similarly, while being 
friendly with the Soviet Union, India never neglected the United 
States. It maintained an equal level of friendship with both 
countries. 
  The situation started changing after the Soviet Union was 
fragmented in 1992. Some change occurred in the moderate level 
of friendship that existed between 1941 and 1991. At the same 
time, India improved its ties with the United States without 
sacrificing its right of individuality. The stance adopted by 
India during the Gulf War a shortwhile before the break up of 
the Soviet Union pacified the United States. The then prime 
minister Chandrashekhar permitted the American warplanes, which 
took part in the Gulf war, to refuel in India. Although the 
opposition leader Rajiv Gandhi protested and the event created 
some turmoil, the Gulf War came to an end by then and the United 
States emerged victorious. Besides appreciating India for its 
cooperation, the United States came forward to strengthen its 
ties with India. 
  As a result, Indo-U.S. joint military exercises were 
organized. The commanders of the armed forces of the two 
countries met and held discussions. During the war in 
Afghanistan, the United States was lending support to the Afghan 
militants through Pakistan. Although Pakistan acted with silly 
intentions to neglect India, the United States did not endorse 
it. Moreover, when the Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan 
and Najibollah relinquished his presidency, the United States 
delinked itself from Pakistan. The resolution moved by Senator 
Larry Pressler to declare Pakistan a terrorist state and 
withhold all assistance because of its support to terrorists in 
Kashmir and Punjab was passed. An ultimatum was also issued to 
Pakistan that it would be declared a terrorist state, unless it 
mends its ways. 
  At this juncture, U.S. presidential elections were held by 
the end of 1992. George Bush was expected to be re-elected as 
the president. He was defeated and Bill Clinton became 
president. Some political observers predicted that India will 
have problems as long as Bill Clinton is the president. This 
was proved right. As soon as President Clinton took office, he 
indirectly made it clear that he is antagonistic toward India. 
He discreetly said that if India does not cooperate with (obey) 
the United States in its efforts to establish global peace, the 
U.S. will resort to other means. 
  What President Clinton said came true. The Soviet Union 
collapsed and the United States now is the only superpower in 
the world. President Clinton is prepared to tell the world that 
all countries should obey the United States and whoever does not 
obey will have to meet the fate of Libya, Cuba, or Iraq. He, 
who vetoed the decision to declare Pakistan a terrorist state, 
has extended assistance to that country and started using it as 
a tool against India. 
  Everything is under the grip of the United States, whether 
it 
is the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, or the 
United Nations. When it imposed certain regulations, India 
endorsed some of them -- those with which it could cope and were 
deemed appropriate. Opposition parties accused Rao of 
introducing the economic liberalization program only per the 
dictates of the World Bank. It is true to a certain extent. 
The World Bank gave directives toward the establishment of a 
market economy in order to pave the way for implementing a 
privatization program, which is aimed at real economic growth 
rather than create a wrong precedence by granting unnecessary 
subsidies and concessions. As this program was deemed 
appropriate, Rao introduced it. 
  Then came the compulsion to accept the Dunkel proposals. It 
is nothing, but granting royalty to a country for a commodity 
which solely originates from that country. Although we have to 
grant royalty to the United States for some particular 
pharmaceuticals, we stand to gain in several ways. Agriculture 
will not be affected. Only after realizing this did the 
government accept the Dunkel proposals. 
  The United States, however, is exerting pressure on India to 
sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. The United 
States thinks that if India signs the treaty, it can enslave 
India by crippling its military might. The treaty does not say 
anything about destroying nuclear weapons from the developed 
countries or to prevent their manufacture. India has insisted 
for the past few years that it will not sign a treaty which is 
aimed at crippling only the developing countries. This alone 
enraged the United States. 
  Then again, the United States has not given up the intention 
of setting up a military base in India. It has been nurturing 
this intention for several years. When India sensed this, it 
decided not to have any military exercises or strengthen its 
military ties with the United States. India's frontier regions 
are best suited to conduct military exercises or launch 
offensives from land, sea, or hilly terrains. Hence, the United 
States also wants to browbeat China by establishing bases in 
India, especially on its border with Kashmir by upgrading its 
military ties with India. India has not accepted this. 
  India's advancement in missile technology has also amplified 
the irritation of the United States. The successive 
accomplishments in the testing of Agni and Prithvi missiles have 
intensified President Clinton's indignation against India. 
  Under these circumstances only, President Clinton 
unnecessarily raked up the Punjab and Kashmir issues. Where 
there is a gradual return of peace in Punjab, he spoke about the 
deprivation of the rights of the Sikhs. His statements about 
the violation of human rights in Kashmir and about his readiness 
to assist the terrorists have dismayed India to an unprecedented 
level. So far, no president has raked up the issue of Kashmir 
or Punjab in such a silly manner just because India is not their 
slave. Similarly, they did not encourage Pakistan after 
describing it a terrorist state. Now, Clinton has done it. 
Indian experts are of the opinion that it is not going to bring 
any change. 
  India has begun to protect itself and to improve its growth 
without caring about the United States. Like China and Japan, 
it is ready now to speak with dignity and honor at international 
fora. The Kashmir issue, however, is a stumbling block in this 
regard. The central government believes that if terrorists are 
dealt with and elections held in Kashmir, normalcy can be 
restored there through democratic rule. However, although the 
United States will not create a big headache for India over 
Kashmir, it will not fail to use it as leverage to coerce India 
to sign the NPT. 
  Indo-U.S. ties deriorated to such an extent only after 
President Clinton assumed office. He is not going to yield, 
whatever peace efforts India makes. As long as he continues in 
office, there will not be any dearth of problems. It is a 
matter of two and a half years only. After that a new president 
will come to power. The American people always have regards for 
India. They would like to maintain friendship with India. On 
this score, we believe that the crack in Indo-U.S. ties is of a 
temporary nature.

<F P=106> ["Press Briefing" on Robin Raphel Visit] </F>
  [Text] Ms. Raphel continued her discussions today with 
senior officials in the ministries of commerce, external 
affairs, and finance. She met the commerce secretary and his 
senior colleagues followed by a meeting with the foreign 
secretary followed by a call on the minister of state for 
external affairs, Shri R.L. Bhatia. Later in the evening, she 
met the finance secretary. The joint secretary (America) [in 
charge of American affairs] hosted a working lunch for her which 
views were exchanged on various issues of mutual interest with 
some other joint secretaries in charge of territorial divisions 
in the MEA [Ministry of External Affairs]. [sentence as received] 
  Assistant secretary Raphel called on the minister of state, 
Shri R.L. Bhatia, following her discussions with the foreign 
secretary. The MOS (RLB) [Minister of State R.L. Bhatia] traced 
the changes in the global political situation following the end 
of the Cold War, outlined India's efforts to improve relations 
with our neighbours and countries in the Gulf, and CIS. 
Development of still friendlier bilateral relations with the 
U.S. was a major priority in India's foreign policy. As two 
vibrant democracies, there were bound to be some differences on 
some issues. He outlined India's consistent position on and 
preference for a global comprehensive and non-discriminatory 
approach on non-proliferation and security related issues. 
Assistant Secretary Raphel reciprocated MOS, Shri Bhatia's 
sentiments to improve Indo-US relations and to work towards 
reaching the understandings on issues the two countries had 
differing positions and perceptions. 
  The discussions with the foreign secretary covered a wide 
range of bilateral issues. Visits from USA by the secretaries 
(ministers) of commerce and energy were mentioned in this 
connection. Ms. Raphel expressed the hope that the prime 
minister of India would find it convenient to pay a visit to 
Washington on President Clinton's invitation. Turning to 
relations with Pakistan, the FS [foreign secretary] reiterated 
India's willingness to resume a dialogue under the Simla 
Agreement at foreign secretary's level and hoped Pakistan would 
eschew the path of internationalisation and support to 
trans-border terrorism. Ms. Raphel stated that the U.S. 
welcomed the continuation of the bilateral dialogue between 
India and Pakistan which was resumed in January 1994 and stood 
willing to encourage this process to facilitate resolution of 
all outstanding problems between the two countries. Referring 
to J and K [Jammu and Kashmir], the FS drew the attention to the 
resolution adopted by the Indian parliament and asserted that 
Pakistan's efforts to agitate the issue would not succeed in 
fulfilling its territorial ambitions. The foreign secretary 
regretted that Pakistan had taken steps such as the proposed 
closure of their consulate in Bombay and the embargo on Indian 
citizens crossing the land border at Wagah. Indo-U.S. bilateral 
cooperation on issues like narcotics control, education and 
culture and science and technology were noted with satisfaction 
as also the greatly increased levels of trade, investment and 
economic ties. The foreign secretary reciprocated Ms. Raphel's 
statement on behalf of the U.S. administration that the United 
States favours the strengthening of ties with India, building on 
the positive features of the present relationship and bridging 
areas where lack of understanding exists through regular 
dialogue. On non-proliferation, Ms. Raphel raised the 
possibility of discussing this issue in a multilateral forum. 
Referring to a U.S. proposal to discuss such issues within a 
small group of countries, the FS expressed certain reservations 
regarding this concept, underlining India's policies laid out in 
the 1988 action plan presented to the United Nations. 
  Turning to the possibility of amendment of the Pressler 
legislation or a one time waiver thereof, the FS expressed 
strong reservations on this approach, since any accretion of 
Pakistan's offensive military capabilities would escalate 
tensions in the region and seriously affect India's security 
environment. It was agreed that further discussions on these 
issues would be held during the visit of the deputy secretary of 
state, Strobe Talbott. 
  The discussions with the commerce secretary covered wide 
range of issues. These included developments following the 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round and specific issues on Indo-U.S. 
bilateral trade. Both the commerce secretary and Assistant 
Secretary Raphel expressed satisfaction at the increased 
momentum in the bilateral trade relationship, the growing 
interest in the U.S. business community in commercial 
interaction with India and expressed optimism about the 
potential in further growth in the bilateral trade. 
  Specific issues like difficulties being experienced by 
Indian 
software engineers in respect of HIB [expansion unknown] visa, 
apprehensions about the revival of Super 301 and other pressing 
issues of interest to U.S. were raised. Assistant Secretary 
Raphel said that the USG [U.S. Government] would use Super 301 
consistent with GATT and the results of the Uruguay Round. 
  The commerce secretary also outlined India's efforts to work 
out a preferential trading arrangement under the aegis of the 
SAARC [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]. He 
expressed the hope that Pakistan would join other SAARC members 
in this endeavour. 
  Both commerce secretary and the assistant secretary looked 
forward to further strengthening of India-U.S. trade relations 
and expressed the hope that the forthcoming visit of U.S. 
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown would provide an added impetus.

<F P=106> [Article by Aabha Dixit] </F>
  [Text] A renewed focus upon non-proliferation in South Asia 
seems to have sharply moved up in priority on the Clinton 
Administration agenda. A flurry of visits to and from 
Washington in the near future are expected to produce a fresh 
bout of nuclear activism. Ms. Robin Raphel's visit to New Delhi 
is only a prelude to higher level exchanges between India, 
Pakistan and the U.S. 
  While the Clinton Administration is beginning to flex its 
muscles to get New Delhi and Islamabad into a nuclear 
nonproliferation embrace, the operational element of this 
strategy unfortunately continues to rely upon flawed logic. By 
reviving the planes-for- non-proliferation strategy, Washington 
hopes to give its overall nuclear nonproliferation goals a 
significant boost. In the past few weeks, the Administration 
has been seeking to manoeuvre past strong Congressional opinion 
by using the supply of stranded F-16 planes to Pakistan, on a 
one-time exception basis, to induce a capping of Pakistan's 
clandestine nuclear weapons programme. Such a move, apart from 
the hydraheaded implications for the subcontinent, is fraught 
with expected risks of failure. 
  Through the 1980's, the Reagan Administration's guns for 
influence policy produced no tangible results on the nuclear 
front for Washington. Despite soaking up nearly $10 billion in 
economic- cum-military assistance, Islamabad's bellicosity 
towards its eastern neighbour remained acute. Neither did the 
drive towards acquiring a nuclear weapon capability slow down. 
To the contrary, Islamabad was convinced that the guns for 
influence policy may have been intended for its nuclear 
programme but, in effect, it held a virtual veto, because of the 
anticipation of Washington's policies whose real thrust was to 
keep open the channels of communication with the Afghan 
Mojahedin. Having cooperated with the CIA, the military regime 
in Islamabad was given a virtual free hand to procure critical 
parts for the bomb from the West. Over all, this policy only 
produced a feverish arms race in the subcontinent. 
  With Afghanistan removed from its strategic "concerns", 
Washington realised that Islamabad and the Generals had pulled 
wool over its eyes through the entire period of the Afghan 
resistance. It acted belated in deciding that the Pakistan 
nuclear establishment had crossed the "red light", which 
warranted them to stop economic and military aid, halfway 
through the second phase of the assistance programme. President 
Bush's inability to provide the waiver certificate in October 
1990 automatically brought forth the provisions of the Pressler 
Amendment. 
  The decision to seek the repeal of the Pressler Amendment 
has 
been a stated objective of the Clinton Administration. But its 
attempts to re-write the Freedom Assistance Act without a 
country specific language have not been acceptable to U.S. 
lawmakers. Without the requisite votes, the Clinton 
Administration publicly forwarded a draft that retained the 
language of the Pressler Amendment. But privately it has been 
pursuing an innovative track in diplomacy. The Grand Strategy 
that has been crafted by the South Asia Department in Foggy 
Bottom is to maximize the leverage that Washington has with 
Islamabad, New Delhi and Congress over the Pressler Amendment. 
  It is no secret that the supply of the stranded 71 F-16's 
has 
become the focal point of the dispute between Islamabad and 
Washington. The F-16's, apart from their operational 
versatility, have come to symbolise the tenuous nature of their 
bilateral relations. In another context, the F-16 represents 
the jagged edge of a bitter and costly arms race between India 
and Pakistan. Within Pakistan, the supply of the aircraft has 
been projected in popular perception as the test case of 
America's "loyalty" to Islamabad's outstretched hand of 
friendship and assistance. With the stakes getting higher on 
the issue of the delivery of the F-16's, Washington's mandarins 
including Ms. Raphel have conceived of a strategy that seeks to 
develop sufficient leverage over Islamabad by sending signals 
that it is prepared to work for the release of the F-16 for a 
price. This bounty, it is generally assumed, is to seek to cap 
the nuclear weapon programme. 
  There are two broad interpretations of the proposed moves on 
the South Asian chess board. One view looks upon the F-16 
nuclear capping swap in purely bilateral terms, with New Delhi's 
ability to steer clear of any linkages on New Delhi's nuclear 
front. The resumed supply of F-16's, this view contends, will 
spark a fresh round of purchases. Without a countervailing 
external power capable of giving aircraft that match the large 
dose of F-16's that Islamabad will receive, New Delhi may be 
forced to look at other alternatives to restore the balance. 
The second view looks at the proposed move in alarmist tones. 
They perceive this decision by the Clinton Administration to 
represent a "tilt" towards Islamabad, bringing back earlier 
fears that Washington's Pakistan policy is being worked without 
taking into account New Delhi's sensitivity. 
  There is, however, a need to look at the Administration's 
attempt as part of a larger and more coordinated strategy than 
is generally assumed. In both reports submitted to Congress for 
FY 1992-93, the Administration has consistently singled out 
nuclear non-proliferation as its highest priority item in South 
Asia. The reports have also underlined the manner in which the 
U.S. would want to proceed in achieving this goal. Washington 
would first like to "cap" the programmes of the two countries 
then "freeze" them followed by their "roll back". It is obvious 
that they can achieve this only through simultaneous pressure 
upon Islamabad and New Delhi. 
  Several credible news reports have outlined the course the 
Clinton Administration would like to take. The one-time 
exception is like dangling a carrot before the Benazir Bhutto 
government seeking in return a formal announcement that its 
nuclear programme has been capped. It is evident that 
Washington will not merely accept Pakistani declarations, but 
will seek inspections of nuclear facilities in Pakistan and 
create inventories, thereby hoping to foreclose future 
enrichment and its weapons development programme. The leverage 
to make Islamabad bite the non-proliferation bait will be the 
resumption of the F-16 fighters. Washington hopes that the 
resumption of supply of these high visibility items will allow 
Benazir a face-saving escape route because, technically, 
Islamabad's weapon option would remain open while its future 
capability would be severely hampered. In fact, the controversy 
over nuclear capping that involved all major actors of the 
troika having corroborated the decision to cap the programme, 
albeit with totally differing motivations, could be part of a 
long-term strategy of sensitising Pakistani public opinion to a 
trend that Islamabad may have accepted as au fait. 
  A declaratory posture on nuclear capping would allow the 
Administration to create sufficient grounds within Congress to 
seek the repeal of the Pressler Amendment, allowing for 
resumption of arms supplies to Pakistan. But it would be 
inconceivable for Islamabad to accept such terms on a unilateral 
basis. This is where the second element of Washington's nuclear 
nonproliferation strategy for South Asia comes into play. The 
Robin Raphel visit to New Delhi coincides with the visit of 
General Abdul Waheed Kakar to Washington. The fact that the 
much postponed visit by a Pakistan Army Chief is on, suggests 
that the nuclear issue will be discussed with the man generally 
presumed to be closest to the nuclear button. There is every 
possibility that Ms. Raphel and Strobe Talbott, the Deputy 
Secretary of State, scheduled to visit India some 10 days after 
her, may carry a significant nonproliferation message for India. 
  New Delhi would no doubt come under severe pressure, if 
Washington and Islamabad are able to agree upon this tandem 
approach. While our nuclear disarmament policies have been 
predicated upon a global approach, we have in the recent past 
been persuaded to accept the validity of a regional construct, 
not necessarily confined to South Asia. New Delhi cannot escape 
the ramifications of the impending Pak-U.S. deal on the F-16's. 
  Pressure upon New Delhi notwithstanding, Washington's 
aircraft-for-capping strategy can fall into a similar trap that 
the Reagan and Bush Administrations had fallen into. Capping 
will not remove Islamabad's clandestine bombs nor will it give 
reliable information about how much fissile material Abdul Qadir 
Khan's men would have stashed away elsewhere. Given Islamabad's 
persistent attempts to link Kashmir with the fear of a 
holocaust, Islamabad's declaratory posture needs to be accepted 
with a pinch of salt. Washington may find that in the process 
of capping nuclear programmes in South Asia, it has caused a 
sprint towards overt nuclearisation.

  [Text] The Armenian Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan today 
received the Israeli Ambassador to Armenia Baruch Birenbaun, who 
also represents his country's interests in Georgia. 
  Trade and economic cooperation between the two countries 
were 
discussed during the meeting. Particular attention was given to 
the establishment of mutually advantageous ties in banking, 
agricultural, and energy, the basis for which has already been 
laid during meetings between Armenian and Israeli experts. 
  The ambassador handed a letter to Prime Minister Grant 
Bagratyan from the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. The 
latter affirmed the Israeli government's readiness and interest 
in developing Armenian-Israeli ties. 
  Baruch Birenbaun reiterated that he will exert every effort 
to speed up the establishment of economic, cultural, and 
scientific ties between the two countries.

  [Text] Yerevan, February 24 (SNARK)--"Five factors, at 
least, can prove that Azerbaijan is an aggressor in the Karabakh 
conflict", Caroline Cox, the British Parliament's vice-speaker 
of Great Britain, said today to the SNARK reporter before her 
leaving for London. 
  She said, firstly, it was Azerbaijan that together with the 
former Soviet 4th Army carried out the forcible deportation of 
thousands of Karabakh Armenians in the spring and summer of 
1991. Secondly, as she went on, it was Azerbaijan which imposed 
fierce economic blockades on Armenia and Karabakh that are gross 
violations of human rights. Thirdly, it was Azerbaijan which 
first used weapons of indiscriminate destruction against 
Karabakh civilian people, including Grad multiple-missile rocket 
launchers, that Baroness Cox witnessed herself while visiting 
Stepanakert. Fourthly, only Azerbaijan has used aerial 
bombardment of Karabakh populated areas. And, fifthly, only 
Azerbaijan has used ground-to-air missiles against civilians. 
  As Baroness Cox affirmed, all these ways were used by 
Azerbaijan to drive out completely Armenians from Karabakh. She 
reminded of former Azerbaijan President Elchibey's words: "If 
there is a single Armenian living in Nagorno-Karabakh in 
October, the people of Azerbaijan can take me and hang me in the 
central square of Baku". It is hard to find more convincing 
proofs of Azerbaijan leadership's real intentions, she concluded.

  [Text] Yerevan, 25 Feb -- Armenia should ratify the treaty 
concluded with Russia in 1992 on the legal status of the Russian 
Federation Armed Forces on the territory of the republic, says a 
statement by the republican leadership of the Ramkavar-Azatakan 
Party of Armenia [name as received], published here today. The 
statement by this liberal democratic party says that the Russian 
Parliament ratified this document exactly a year ago, but 
meanwhile, it has not yet been examined by the Supreme Council 
of Armenia. 
  Stressing the importance of Armenian-Russian mutual 
relations, the leadership of the Ramkavar-Azatakan Party of 
Armenia expresses anxiety regarding the Armenian Supreme 
Council's delay in ratifying the treaty. The party's faction in 
the Supreme Council of Armenia will seek to have this issue 
included in the republican Supreme Council's agenda, the 
statement says. 
  The treaty was signed in Moscow on 21 August 1992 by Russian 
and Armenian Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Levon Ter-Petrosyan. 
It settles questions pertaining to the presence on Armenian 
territory of units and formations of Russian Armed Forces.

  [Text] No significant change took place at the front lines 
during the past two days. The confrontation has been mainly in 
the form of positional fighting. The disputing sides have 
refrained from carrying out intensive combat operations. 
  The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] Defense Headquarters has 
disclosed that heavy artillery, Grad rocket launchers, and 
mortars in the eastern part of Agdamskiy Rayon pounded Armenian 
positions around Salakhly, Chengerli, Novruzlu, and Marzili from 
0700 to 0800 on 24 February. The NKR artillery units were 
forced to open fire. Two enemy fire emplacements were destroyed. 
  Meanwhile, the NKR intelligence units have established that 
Azerbaijan is massing reinforcements and military equipment in 
various parts of the eastern front line. 
  The Azerbaijani military units have fired on the Armenian 
defense positions in Mardakertskiy Rayon. However, the 
situation at other parts of the confrontation lines between the 
NKR and Azerbaijan has been relatively peaceful. Several 
observers believe that tension is subsiding at the battlefronts. 
  Tension continues to exist on the border between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan. However, the situation is relatively peaceful. 
Provocative activities have been carried out on the Azerbaijani 
side of the border from time to time. 
  The Armenian Ministry of Defense press service has disclosed 
that the situation was peaceful on the entire border between 
Armenia and Azerbaijan from last night until this afternoon. 
However, the Azerbaijani military forces fired on Berkaber and 
(?Kirants) in Idzhevanskiy Rayon with various types of arms last 
night. No one was hurt. The Armenian border guards were forced 
to carry out retaliatory operations.

  [Text] Moscow (February 24) TURAN--Azerbaijani President 
Aliyev delivered a speech at London's Royal Institute of 
International Relations, reports TURAN's Moscow's correspondent 
according to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  Moscow officials attentively observed several moments of 
President Aliyev's speech. In particular, President Aliyev 
mentioned that Azerbaijan is willing to consider the deployment 
of international peacemaking forces, under the auspices of the 
CSCE, on its territory. This can take place only after a 
complete withdrawal by Armenian troops from Azerbaijani 
territory. 
  A source in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reports 
that Russian troops will form the backbone of the peacemaking 
forces. Moscow's observers believe that since NATO and CSCE are 
totally preoccupied with the settlement of the Bosnian problem, 
they are unlikely to have the strength and means to put into 
place a peacemaking mission in the zone of the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. 
  Russian defense minister mentioned that beginning on March 
1, 
Russia will begin implementation of its peace plan for the 
settlement of the Karabakh conflict. This plan provides for 
bringing Russian peacemaking troops into the zone of the 
Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict. 
  Addressing the Royal Institute, President Aliyev mentioned 
that Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh full rights equal to those of 
Azerbaijani citizens and their security is guaranteed by the 
Constitution of the country. 
  In addition, President Aliyev said that Baku will begin 
discussions over the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. But it is 
connected with the complete withdrawal of Armenian armed forces 
from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan, including 
Nagorno-Karabakh, said President Aliyev. The observers of the 
Russian Defense Ministry noted that Azerbaijan does not exclude 
the possibility of exchange of territory with Armenia. In his 
speech President Aliyev said that issue concerning the exchange 
of "corridors" was repeatedly put forth long ago. But if such a 
necessity arises, we will resume discussion of this matter 
again, mentioned Aliyev. As known, in 1991 American 
politologist, Paul Goble, put forward a proposal concerning the 
exchange of corridors which connects Azerbaijan with Nakhichevan 
and Nagorno-Karabakh. At that time, Armenia and Azerbaijan 
rejected this variant.

  [Text] Baku (February 26) TURAN--Late at night on February 
26 President Geydar Aliyev returned from an official visit to 
London. 
  As reported, during the visit Geydar Aliyev met with the 
leadership of Great Britain. Treaty on Friendship and 
Cooperation, as well as a packet of protocols about the 
intentions were signed. 
  At London press conference on February 24 Geydar Aliyev 
assessed the visit as a "successful". 
  Commenting on the treaty, signed in Moscow by Defense 
Ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia, Geydar Aliyev said that 
"this document infringes upon Azerbaijan's interests, but we 
signed it for the sake of peaceful regulation of the conflict". 
  Answering the question of the journalists about the 
perspectives of peaceful regulation of Armenian-Azeri conflict, 
Aliyev said "we adhere to the peaceful regulation, but the 
recent reports about the Armenian offensive on Tauzskiy region 
of Azerbaijan testify that Armenia is not ready for the peaceful 
regulation of the conflict". Aliyev also said that "in the light 
of the new Armenian attack upon the territory of Azerbaijan, the 
prospects of signing a long-termed peace agreement becomes 
hardly probable".

  [Text] Baku, February 25 (TURAN) -- "It is early to speak 
about the results of the meeting between Defense Ministers of 
Armenia and Azerbaijan", said the leader of press service of 
Azerbaijan Defense Ministry, Azad Isazade. 
  He said that both parties acknowledged their positions 
during 
the meeting. The conditions of Azerbaijan remained the same: 
cease-fire must be preceded by withdrawal of Armenian armed 
units from the territory of Azerbaijan. Until now this problem 
is left unsolved. 
  Isazade mentioned that presently the representatives of 
Defense Ministries of both countries maintain contacts. The 
terms of the truce and withdrawal of troops will be defined at 
the forthcoming meeting of the Presidents of Armenia and 
Azerbaijan. The functions will be divided as follows: 
Azerbaijan will have to cease hostilities along the whole front 
line, Armenia will have to leave all occupied territories of 
Azerbaijan outside of Nagorno-Karabakh, Russia will have to 
observe the implementation of the concluded agreements. The 
fate of Shusha and Lachin is unknown. This problem is expected 
to be settled during the forthcoming meeting of the presidents 
of Azerbaijan and Armenia in Moscow. 
  Having occupied the biggest in Nagorno-Karabakh Azeri city 
of 
Shusha, in May 1992, Armenian units completed the process of 
ethnic cleansing in the region. Having seized neighbouring with 
Shusha and Gorisskiy region of Armenia, Lachin town, Armenian 
units received the corridor connecting Nagorno-Karabakh with 
Armenia.

  [Text] Talks have been held in Moscow on a cease-fire 
agreement to end Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan. The 
Armenian side in the talks, which were held between the Armenian 
and Azerbaijani defense ministers with Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev in Moscow, asked for time to withdraw the Armenian 
forces from the territories they have occupied in Azerbaijan. 
  Reliable sources have said that Azerbaijan Defense Minister 
Mamed-Rafi Mamedov held talks with Armenian Defense Minister 
Serzh Sargisyan in the presence of Pavel Grachev. The two sides 
agreed on the conclusion of a cease-fire agreement. The 
Azerbaijani side stressed that the withdrawal of Armenians from 
the territories they have occupied is essential for the success 
of the agreement. The Armenian side responded by asking for 10 
days for the withdrawal of their troops. However, the 
Azerbaijani side agreed to a period of two days. 
  Russia proposed to dispatch observers to Karabakh on the 
last 
day of the talks. However, Azerbaijan rejected that proposal. 
  Apparently, the Armenians, who have been quickly retreating 
in the face of recent Azerbaijan National Army attacks, have 
decided to call for a cease-fire in order to gain time. That is 
why they have asked for 10 days. 
  Several reliable sources have said that the Armenians are 
trying to gain time though dilatory tactics in order to receive 
aid from Russia and other countries and reorganize their 
military forces.
