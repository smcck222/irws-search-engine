  [Text] An agreement has been signed in Ashgabat on sending 
2.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Azerbaijan in 1994. 
In a statement to an AZERTAC correspondent, Zeynalov, vice 
president of the Azergas Company [Azerbaijan Natural Gas 
Company], said that Azerbaijan planned to receive 3 billion 
cubic meters of natural gas. The supply will be a little less 
because of Turkmenistan's request that we repay 700 million 
cubic meters of the natural gas we wish to buy in the form of 
diesel oil. However, there is a great demand for diesel oil in 
Azerbaijan. In view of this, we were unable to agree to that 
proposal. The sides are currently working to change the 
agreement. Our republic will receive another 700 million cubic 
meters of natural gas if an agreement is reached on repaying 
that amount with other products. 
  Zeynalov also said that Azerbaijan received 6.3 million 
cubic 
meters of natural gas from Turkmenistan on 22 February.

  [Text] Yesterday, Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry 
disseminated a statement resolutely condemning the bloody event, 
which took place in the town of Hebron when Palestinians were at 
prayer. The statement by Ukraine's foreign policy department 
expresses deep sympathy to the families of those who died and 
the hope that the injured will recover. It emphasizes that any 
terrorist actions, whatever their aim might be, and whoever they 
are carried out by, are not justified. 
  Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry has appealed to the 
Palestinian and Israeli sides with a call not to resort to 
self-seeking emotions, and expressed the hope for a continuation 
of the Arab-Israeli dialogue with the aim of achieving a 
peaceful settlement in the Near East.

  [Text] The Ukrainian and Polish foreign ministers had a 
telephone conversation on Friday during which it was decided to 
postpone the visit of Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko 
to Warsaw from February 28 to late March. 
  According to sources close to the Ukrainian Foreign 
Ministry, 
the visit was put off due to the legal proceedings against an 
officer of the Ukrainian Security Service (the so-called case of 
Lysenko) continuing in Warsaw from January 19. 
  Anatoliy Lysenko and his family left for Poland in August, 
1993, on a private invitation and was arrested immediately after 
he crossed the border. 
  Lysenko has been accused of spying for Ukraine. The 
Ukrainian Security Service refutes the accusations.

<F P=106> [Statement by Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of state and </F>
Supreme Council chairman; place and date not given -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] The third round of talks held in Geneva on the 
comprehensive settlement of the Abkhazian conflict has ended 
without success. Although through efforts taken by the Georgian 
party, the United Nations, and the Russian federation there 
appeared hopes that a consent could be reached over the return 
of refugees and the political statute of Abkhazia within the 
Georgian borders, the Gudauta group again took a destructive and 
uncompromising position thus, actually, failing the talks and 
making the situation extremely tense. 
  I consider it necessary to remind the world community that 
Abkhazian separatists have perfidiously violated agreements 
signed by them three times. This was nothing else but a 
disgraceful disregard of fundamental norms of civilized 
behavior. Regardless of these unacceptable activities of the 
Gudauta group, and in order to avoid further bloodshed, the 
Georgian side spared no efforts to use all possible means for 
the peaceful settlement of the conflict. In this respect, 
significant assistance was received from the United Nations 
Organization, the Russian Federation, the CSCE, and the Group of 
Georgia's Friends [a US-based group that includes former 
political figures Shultz, Baker, and others]. I cannot help 
thanking them for all they did in order that a settlement of the 
conflict by political means would become possible. 
  It is regrettable that in response to their efforts the 
Gudauta group launched a new wave of genocide of Georgians, the 
tragic effect of which we are already facing. Hundreds of 
people were killed and injured, while 15,000 joined those 
300,000 refugees who were forced to abandon the land of their 
ancestors in order to avoid death. The Abkhazian separatists 
have again ignored universally accepted norms and did not permit 
a group of UN observers, including the head of the group, 
General (Videkaar), to go to Gali Rayon and give an appropriate 
assessment of the events taking place there. I believe that 
this scandalous act was not followed by an adequate reaction 
from international organizations and the whole world community. 
Fundamental international norms were disregarded and all this 
cannot be left unpunished if we are aspiring to build a just and 
harmonious world. 
  Despite all the abovementioned, the Georgian leadership 
regarded it possible to participate in the following meeting in 
Geneva in order to completely use even the smallest opportunity 
to settle the Abkhazian conflict peacefully. 
  It is evident that the Gudauta side failed the talks with 
the 
aim to exterminate or drive a small part of the Georgian 
population still remaining there out of Abkhazia, make the 
return of refugees impossible, and cut them off from their 
motherland Abkhazia forever. 
  The situation is extremely tense today. I can declare with 
all responsibility that in case the negotiating parties, the UN 
Security Council, and the Russian Federation fail to find the 
fastest way to come out of the crisis, a spontaneous explosion 
and renewal of large-scale combat operations will be 
unavoidable. This will be followed by a bloodshed the scale and 
cruelty of which will exceed everything witnessed by the much 
suffered land so far. The events will develop spontaneously and 
it will be impossible to keep them under control. 
  Therefore, we do agree to an immediate continuation of 
negotiations. I, personally, am ready to visit the UN Security 
Council, meet the UN secretary general, his plenipotentiary 
envoy, the leadership of the Russian Federation, and 
representatives of friendly countries in order that the 
catastrophic effects that will certainly follow the failure of 
the Geneva talks are avoided. 
  A dialogue that will be held in Washington and New York 
during my official visit to the United States following 
President Clinton's invitation will have to provide a 
substantial contribution to a political settlement of the 
Abkhazian conflict.

<F P=106> ["Excerpt" of address by Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze </F>
to a meeting of the Citizens Union party on 26 February; place 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Our prime concern is Abkhazia, our return to 
Abkhazia, and the resolution of the Samachablo [South Ossetia] 
issue. 
  Unfortunately, the Geneva meeting [Georgian-Abkhaz talks 
held 
22-25 February] ended without result. Even so, one important 
thing happened there. When there was talk about Abkhazia's 
status -- we should also make compromises -- the positions of 
our delegation, the Russian delegation, UN representatives, and 
our friends -- the United States, France, and Germany -- 
coincided. This is very important. 
  It also emerged that separatism is what it is and that a 
different language would probably be necessary in talking to 
them. Not only at our level, but also at the Security Council, 
in Russia and elsewhere. This was very important as far as 
political settlement and political solution are concerned. By 
the way, speaking about status, we found Russia's Constitution 
and experience, as well as the world experience, rather useful. 
  Anyway, the fact that our positions coincided gives us an 
opportunity to work more actively. 
  To tell you the truth, what interests me most in my visit to 
the United States is to establish relations with the IMF, the 
World Bank and, especially, to visit the Security Council. I do 
not rule out the possibility that a Security Council meeting may 
be held on 8 or 9 March in which I will participate, provided we 
succeed in having this issue included in the agenda. Then, it 
is possible that the issue of peacekeeping forces will be 
decided.

  [Text] [Announcer] The Georgian delegation [to 
Abkhaz-Georgian talks] returned to Tbilisi from Geneva 
yesterday. Today our correspondent met the leader of the 
delegation, Jaba Ioseliani. We now present an excerpt from an 
interview which will be shown fully after this information 
program. 
  [Begin recording] [Ioseliani] We knew from the outset that 
they would not agree to talks. Well, they would agree to talks, 
but they would not sign anything. We knew this very well. We 
were meeting them anyway, so that the world would know who we 
are dealing with, what their demands are and what they want. 
  This is because people abroad do not understand what is 
happening. We are five million, while they are 70 [thousand]. 
How can they have done anything at all? We must be the culprits. 
  This is because they are using everything, while we are not 
using anything. If they were in our position, they would 
trumpet their cause abroad, they would shout, cry and all that. 
We are not doing this. 
  We knew the (?situation) very well and acted little by 
little. Still, they find it hard to understand the situation. 
There have been three meetings, right? British, Americans -- 
our friends were there. They were sympathetic, but they also 
thought that we must be saying something wrongly. They thought: 
not everything is as they [Georgians] say. When there are two 
parties, both must be guilty of something. That is how it is in 
general. 
  But after they saw it this time, they went almost mad. Look 
what kind of people they [Abkhazians] are, they said, [words 
indistinct]. I did not say a word; I sat quiet. 
  Are you really giving them autonomy, they asked us. 
  Of course, we are, I said. 
  But what else do they [Abkhazians] want, they asked. 
  Ask them what they want, I said. [end recording]

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 25 Feb -- The third round of talks to settle 
the Abkhazia-Georgia conflict, sponsored by the UN and SCSE and 
with Russia as mediator, ended today in Geneva without the 
signing of a final document. ITAR-TASS was told by the press 
service of the plenipotentiary representative of the Republic of 
Abkhazia in Moscow that the talks dealt with peace guarantees in 
the region, return of refugees, and Abkhazia's political status. 
  The Abkhazian side put the failure to sign a final document 
down to the Georgian delegation's "uncompromising position" over 
a political status for Abkhazia. According to the press 
service, this status amounts in essence to the relationship of 
imperial center and colony, a lack of desire to accept current 
realities. This toughening of the Georgian government's stance 
is attributed by Abkhazia to "the signing of a treaty with 
Russia and hopes that Russian troops will police Abkhazia, and 
also an attempt by certain circles in the West to preserve the 
Shevardnadze regime". 
  Despite the difficult nature of the talks, it was decided to 
continue the search for a political solution to the 
Abkhazia-Georgia conflict.

  [Text] Our correspondent in Armenia, Karun Khumaryan, is 
here now with news from Armenia: 
  [Begin Khumaryan recording] For the fourth day running there 
has been no traffic on the railway linking Armenia with Georgia; 
no electric power is being supplied to the section between 
Tbilisi and Sadokhlo -- this is the last station of the Georgian 
section of the railway. Georgia's authorities explain the 
standstill of traffic by an accident at the Gardabani power 
station. Of course, this is a more than objective reason. But, 
after all, in the Georgian ports of Batumi and Poti cargo 
intended for Armenia, including food such as flour, oil, sugar, 
are traditionally unloaded. 
  A meeting between Georgia's Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia, 
who has arrived in Armenia, and President Levon Ter-Petrosyan 
and Premier Grant Bagratyan, was devoted to the question of the 
normalization of the operation of the railway and the transit 
supply of Turkmenian gas across Georgia to Armenia. President 
Levon Ter-Petrosyan also told representatives of the diplomatic 
corps accredited in Yerevan of the difficult situation which has 
arisen in Armenia because of the traffic on the southern section 
of the Georgian Railway grinding to a halt. Touching on this 
meeting, Vahan Papazyan, the republic's Foreign Minister, stated 
at the latest briefing: I don't think that the meeting with the 
diplomats will produce immediate results, but something will be 
done, because it is not advantageous to any of the countries 
whose representatives attended the meeting for there to be an 
unstable situation in Armenia and Georgia. The Minister also 
said, and I am now quoting from the "Armenian Republic" 
newspaper: Georgia, availing itself of its convenient geographic 
situation, is bringing pressure to bear on Armenia. In turn, 
other neighbors of ours are pressuring Georgia into bringing 
pressure to bear on Armenia. But, thanks to the fact that we 
have a positive balance with Turkmenistan -- and that to date we 
should be receiving 12 million cubic meters of natural gas per 
24 hours -- Armenia agrees to sell half of its gas to Georgia so 
that it take upon itself the delivery of cargo from the ports of 
Poti and Batumi to our country. Georgia proved unprepared for 
this proposal of ours, and Patsatsia has returned to Georgia for 
consultations. 
  It is difficult to say how long these consultations will 
last, but one thing is clear: Without a railway link with the 
outer world Armenia will find it exceedingly difficult to live.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Lennart Meri on the occasion of the </F>
76th anniversary of the Republic of Estonia, in the "Estonia" 
Concert Hall on 24 February -- received via Internet E-LIST] 
  [Text] Your Excellencies, 
  Honored members of the Riigikogu [parliament] and the 
Government, 
  Dear compatriots in Estonia and throughout the world. 
  Firstly permit me to congratulate you on the occasion of the 
76th anniversary of the Republic of Estonia, and to thank you 
for the support which you have expressed to the Republic of 
Estonia on the occasion of today's anniversary - not only by 
letter and telegram, but also in your conversations and 
handshakes. These radiate hope - yet also concern, satisfaction 
about what has been achieved - yet heartache about what has not 
been achieved, a dignified confidence of a free people - yet an 
uncertainty, a willingness to make sacrifices - as well as the 
anxious question: For how much longer? How long will we be able 
to sacrifice ourselves, to feed ourselves on this immense 
longing for independence, which we accumulated into our hearts 
during the long night that was the fifty years of Soviet 
occupation? 
  Are these the first signs of weariness? 
  No, we are not weary, and we will not become weary. We have 
never tired, throughout the seven centuries, of carrying our 
country within ourselves, and therefore we will not tire seven 
months before the last of the foreign troops leave the holy soil 
of Estonia. No, it is rather impatience, which has been born of 
suffering. It is rather our illusionary optimism, that once 
totalitarian communism collapses, all our longings and wishes 
will magically come true. Fifty years outside Europe, outside 
the practicality of democratic politics, which daily teaches 
people the balance between rights and duties - has taught us 
only how to circle our wagons for protection, how to personally 
survive, the stealthy avoidance of the commands and instructions 
coming from the capital of the colonial empire. Our romantic 
optimism has been, and is still, a nurturing source, which has 
nurtured, and still nurtures, the dangerous illusion that the 
restoration of an independent state should be simple and speedy. 
  A nation is not born simply nor speedily. Even before I 
entered politics, when I spoke to you, my dear compatriots, in 
the language of a writer, I quoted Churchill, saying that the 
road we have chosen demands blood, toil, tears and sweat from 
all of us. The world can be proud of Estonia, because 
everything we have achieved in our 76 years has been achieved 
with hard work and patience, sweat and toil, but without a drop 
of blood being spilled, as is characteristic of a lawful nation. 
Today, standing here before you in this historic hall, I can 
assure you that our major difficulties are behind us, but that 
new trials await us. These, too, we will overcome if we unite 
our forces and abilities, instead of fragmenting them; if we 
soberly assess how much has been done and how much is yet to be 
done; and what is most important: No matter how many differing 
opinions there are between our political parties, and in 
ourselves, that the Estonian's calm confidence and friendly 
desire to cooperate must rise above all this, and unite us into 
a Republic of Estonia, of which we can be proud. 
<H5>  1. The Estonian Nation and Its People </H5>
  The Constitution adopted by referendum declared the 
steadfast 
will of the Estonian people to safeguard and develop their 
nation. A nation which is founded on liberty, justice and law. 
A nation which defends internal and external peace. 
  It would now be an appropriate time to say that culture is 
politics, and politics is culture. 
  Culture is politics because it is primarily in culture where 
the national identity becomes apparent - identity is a necessary 
element, a substance which is difficult to describe, but from 
which nations are born. 
  Politics is culture primarily because the ultimate aim of 
politics is to defend the individual, to assist the individual 
to determine and deepen the characteristics of a person. The 
primary characteristic of a person is the phenomenon: That a 
person does not exist outside a culture. 
  The Estonian people have therefore created a nation for 
themselves. The supreme power of the state is held by the 
people. The state must secure the development of all the people, 
as well as the opportunity of every person for self-fulfillment. 
The mechanism for this is determined by the Constitution as the 
separate and balanced supreme bodies of state power - the 
Riigikogu, the Government of the Republic, the court system, 
with the President of the Republic as the balancing factor. 
During the last year, the supreme bodies of state power have 
been formed and have begun operations. The Riigikogu has done 
an enormous amount of work, and to date, as we heard in the 
speech by the Speaker of the Riigikogu Mr. Ulo Nugis, at the 
flag-raising ceremony this morning, the Riigikogu has adopted 
one-fifth of the body of legislation, and has therefore created 
a working legislative basis. All the components are there. But 
the total of this is not yet a state - at least not such a 
state, which has the usual characteristics of European nations. 
  And so we are confronted by a paradoxical problem. 
  The Estonian people, who have been liberated from a colonial 
yoke, have more idealism, more willingness to sacrifice in the 
name of freedom, than the peoples of welfare states, who lack 
our tragic historical experience. Despite this, there is an 
increase in a skeptical attitude towards the Riigikogu and the 
Government. Demeaning law and order, the police in particular, 
has become almost a competition. The mentality of the 
Soviet-era serf-worker, which we have thrown out via the door, 
is now creeping in through the window - the attitude of: It's 
the master's rope, let it run loose. 
  Citizens do not understand the balance between their rights 
and obligations. 
  At this stage, my dear compatriots, we should ask: Is this 
the way to build the Estonian nation? 
<H5>  2. Post-Communist Nightmare </H5>
  Let us try to soberly analyze the reasons for this problem. 
  My learned colleagues in the West see the reasons for the 
collapse of the Soviet totalitarian regime in the command 
economy. They say, this system was biased towards the armaments 
industry of the Soviet Union and simply collapsed due to the 
excessive burden. 
  This simplified explanation is only partially true. Rather, 
it is completely erroneous. The Soviet totalitarian regime was 
taken to the extreme. It commanded not so much the economy, but 
peoples' ability to think, the creativity of people. The 
ceiling for people's creativity was determined by the low 
ceiling of the Politburo's thinking prowess. The most tragic 
result of this was the complete and final liberation of people, 
the liberation of people from their heaviest burden -- the 
obligation to think, to make independent decisions, and to bear 
the responsibility of their decisions. 
  In restoring our nation and economy, we must also 
simultaneously restore the citizen who thinks and voluntarily 
takes responsibility, because democracy can only be based on 
such a citizen. And only a thinking citizen comprehends the 
unavoidable dangers of belittling the Estonian nation: Economic 
success itself does not guarantee the security of the nation, 
and following on from this, does not guarantee the continued 
existence of a state, of the people, their language and culture, 
and, therefore, the continued existence of the world. Estonian 
society is currently resolving the problems of its own 
re-organization, a process that only few Western academics can 
appreciate. The transition to democracy and a free market 
economy is like a leap across a crevice: The feet no longer 
rest on the steep cliff edge, but they have not yet landed on 
the other side. This instant of unsupportedness, this moment, 
this frightening uncertainty, has brought about chaotic 
phenomena in our society and, if these tendencies persist, they 
could open a Pandora's box. 
<H5>  3. Let's Restore Order </H5>
  I see crime as the prime domestic threat. Performances in 
the theater begin at 5 pm. because people are afraid of walking 
on the streets in the dark. Even during daylight people are 
afraid of walking in the park. People are afraid of country 
roads. People are afraid of a knock on their door. Estonians 
do not feel secure in their own country. This is only one step 
away from a nostalgic longing for the past, and of alienation 
from the state, when we prefer to peek out from behind the 
curtains in the evenings. If crime rules the streets and the 
stairwells, we must be honest and say: Estonia is approaching 
dual power. A year ago, at a meeting on state security on 
February 25, I indicated that our priority is to guarantee 
security for our population. I am very concerned that today, a 
year later, this task is even more important. There are many 
reasons for this: Firstly, lack of security may keep foreign 
investors away, because nothing will attract investors to a 
region of high risk; secondly, it places in doubt our 
trustworthiness as a partner; thirdly, it opens Pandora's box - 
the yearning for a strong hand. The recent rash proposal by 
some adventurers to use state terror to fight crime shames the 
Republic of Estonia. 
  From this podium, allow me to assure you: There is no 
fertile ground for either left or right wing extremism in 
Estonia. There is no fertile ground for the use of a "strong 
hand" in Estonia. But we have to reach consensus on 
strengthening features of our state which have become blurred. 
Let our first and common priority for the following year be to 
restore order. This is not a call to arms. This is the second 
article of our Constitution which guarantees basic rights, 
liberties and duties. Our principal right, our thousand year 
old right, has been, and is, to have a safe home in Estonia. No 
more, but not an inch less. 
  Nobody should waver from this goal. The establishment of 
order must start from the grassroots and end with the ministers. 
Here it is suitable to use the words of John Kennedy: Don't 
ask what your country can do for you, but what you can do for 
your country. And let us not forget that the Constitution and 
the rights derived from it can and should be defended only 
through legal means and with legal arguments. 
<H5>  4. National Security </H5>
  The aforementioned forces me to discuss priorities. 
  A controlled border is one of the main features of a state. 
  I regret that negotiations with the Russian Federation have 
been progressing at a snail's pace. I am nevertheless convinced 
that the Russian Federation will fulfil the obligation that it 
has undertaken and that it will withdraw its armed forces from 
the Republic of Estonia by August 31st. In reference to this, I 
am pleased to recall that last year President Yeltsin based his 
congratulations on the 75-year continuity of the Republic of 
Estonia. During his visits to Poland, the Czech Republic, 
Slovakia and Hungary, President Yeltsin distanced himself from 
the aggressive foreign policy of the former Soviet Union in a 
way that also corresponds to our hopes. Despite all this, we 
have preferred to build up our defense forces at the expense of 
effective border control. Now we are suffering the consequences 
of this decision. The loss of the feeling of security and the 
rise in organized crime is a direct consequence of this 
miscalculation. If the Republic of Estonia becomes a corridor 
of illegitimate trade of human beings, radioactive scrap metal, 
precious stones and who knows what else, it will add 
international security problems to our domestic ones. The 
international community will have difficulty regarding the 
Republic of Estonia as a trustworthy partner and will find it 
difficult to integrate her into the collective security system. 
A controlled border should be understood here as a feature of 
the state, and not as some kind of Asiatic iron curtain, the 
task of which is to separate the Russian Federation from Europe. 
The foreign policy of the Republic of Estonia has always been 
open, open to all of the states with which we share common 
democratic ideals. Rapid integration is taking place in today's 
changing world. In a small country like Estonia, we must 
integrate our domestic and foreign policy into one Republic of 
Estonia security policy. That concept is based upon equitable 
economic integration, upon concentric circles, where the first 
circle is the Baltic states, the next the Baltic Sea states and 
the European Union. No matter how far away the goal may be, the 
time factor is stalking us like a bad dream. Like Alice in 
Wonderland, we have to run fast to stay in the one place, in 
order that we may survive. Up until now we have accomplished 
this, even if it has been through great effort and with great 
sacrifice. The highest price was paid by our older generations, 
our pensioners who have given life to the people, have brought 
them up and have fed them with the hope for independence. Now it 
is our time to say: Independence is not born, and will not 
live, merely through longing. Independence endures and grows 
stronger, if longing and will marry. Much depends upon will, 
and in difficult times everything depends upon it. 
  In Osterby village in Swedish north-western Estonia, Adeele 
Paavelt sat on the edge of her bed and knitted a pair of socks 
as an Independence Day present for an unknown soldier in the 
defense forces of the Republic of Estonia. Many decades ago she 
also knitted socks for her husband, who lies buried in Siberian 
earth. Now Adeele Paavelt asks you, my dear compatriots, have 
you knitted socks for the soldier boys. She has not run out of 
longing and will. Adeele Paavelt is 94 years old. We remain in 
her debt, and she remains our example. I hope that in 
ninety-four years time, someone will say the same words about 
our generations.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 25, BNS -- Cooperation between the 
Baltic states is at present one of Estonia's first priorities, 
said President Lennart Meri in an interview to the Lithuanian 
RESPUBLIKA newspaper. 
  "If our cooperation is limited to questions of security 
systems or foreign policy, everything may remain at the level of 
mere rhetoric," Meri noted. He said the Baltic states must 
realize that, under their geopolitical conditions, issues of 
security and foreign policy can be solved only if they have a 
common economic basis. 
  In Meri's opinion, the Baltic states' cooperation must 
proceed from integrating their energy systems, which would set 
them free from dependence on Russia. 
  "Realization of our independence would allow us to regard 
Russia in a considerably friendlier light," the Estonian 
president stated.

  [Text] Commenting on the Russian president's address at the 
Russian parliament yesterday, Estonian Foreign Minister Juri 
Luik said that it had not recalled the need to withdraw troops 
from the Baltic states by 31 August. The foreign minister said 
that on several occasions the so-called protection of Russians' 
rights had been mentioned, and these are not the generally 
accepted human rights that are the case here but the rights of 
Russians. A threatening voice was used repeatedly in the course 
of the speech, firm and tough action was promised in protection 
of those rights. Russia did not make a reference to 
international law. Instead, she takes the liberty to interfere 
in the domestic affairs of others whenever she sees fit. 
  Luik is worried about the Russian president's (?statement) 
that regarding relations with the West there have been 
concessions made unilaterally, [word indistinct] in respect of 
the state budget. It seems that the idea of dismantling the 
totalitarian war machine has been abandoned and it is considered 
important to restore it. 
  [Words indistinct] that part of the speech devoted to 
Europe. 
The impression is that there is no desire to accept the 
standards that exist in Europe; instead, there is a desire to 
rework them. Such an approach is incomprehensible to Estonia. 
Estonia is fully satisfied with a Europe based on a market 
economy and a policy of consensus. It emerges quite clearly 
what Russia's interests are. It remains completely unclear, 
though, how Russia plans to consider other countries' interests, 
said Foreign Minister Luik.

<F P=106> [Parliamentary appeal in support of early parliamentary </F>
elections, to be held on 27 March, read by Supreme Council 
Deputy Chairman Vasyl Durdynets, at the Supreme Council session 
in Kiev -- live] 
  [Text] [Supreme Council Speaker Ivan Plyushch] The floor is 
given to Vasyl Vasylyovych Durdynets speaking from the 
commission...[correcting himself] from the Presidium, to read 
out the text of the Supreme Council Presidium statement that is 
being submitted for the Supreme Council's consideration. 
Attention please. 
  [Durdynets] The appeal by the Supreme Council of Ukraine: 
Esteemed Ukrainian citizens, Ukraine is experiencing hard times. 
The economic crisis has not been overcome. Social problems have 
become extraordinarily acute. Under conditions when trust in 
any branch of power has gone down, the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine, at the people's justifiable request, adopted the only 
right decision to hold early elections first to the Supreme 
Council in March and then to Ukraine's president and local 
authorities in June. 
  So, Ukraine is on the threshold of undergoing new important 
changes to its political and economic life. We have a chance to 
continue the transformation of Ukraine in a peaceful way, doing 
this as it was done in the majority of democratic countries in 
Europe and the world: From an election to an election, replacing 
the Supreme Council and therefore, the government, i.e. making 
changes in the body of those who will determine state domestic 
and foreign policy. 
  It is very good that Ukraine has avoided the use of armed 
force to change political power. However, in order further to 
ensure the peaceful way of revolutionary transformation in 
Ukraine, the elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine on 27 
March of this year have to take place successfully. 
  Some facts and statements, however, demonstrate that not 
everybody in Ukraine has an interest in holding these elections 
successfully. There is talk about some kind of vacuum of power. 
Some are even openly interested in the sabotage and disruption 
of these elections. If the elections to the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine do not take place, this will only increase political and 
economic instability and lead to a constitutional crisis in 
Ukraine. 
  However, there will be no vacuum of power. After all, the 
current Supreme Council convocation will retain its 
constitutional powers and work until March 1995. But do we 
really need to go back when a change in the body of the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council already can and must occur on 27 March 
1994. 
  This is exactly why the Supreme Council of Ukraine appeals 
to 
its citizens, every official and authority who is involved in 
organizing and holding the election campaign and asks them to 
demonstrate high responsibility at this time so important to 
Ukraine. Any actions and statements that lead to the disruption 
or sabotage of the elections, are inadmissible. Nor are any 
violations of the law on elections are admissible. 
  The Supreme Council of Ukraine draws the attention of the 
central, district, and all area electoral commissions, state 
mass media and state TV and radio leadership, to the need 
essentially to improve their activity aimed at stepping up the 
preelection campaign, ensuring the objectivity and fullness of 
its coverage, and preventing restrictions of the rights of 
candidates for deputies and electors. 
  Dear compatriots, let us realize our chance of changes in 
the 
life of each of us and our society as a whole. [Deputies then 
adopted the above appeal in a vote by raising hands.]

  [Text] Kiev February 25 TASS -- Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk conditioned his participation in presidential elections 
and said it is first necessary to elect a new parliament and 
determine the powers of the future president. 
  "My decision on participation in early presidential 
elections 
depends on many factors", he told reporters on Friday. 
  "First and foremost we have to elect a new parliament and 
appoint a new Cabinet of Ministers", he stressed and added that 
any candidate for the presidency "should know his future powers" 
before joining the election campaign. 
  "At present they (the powers) have not been determined. If 
the new president is elected according to the acting 
constitution, the new parliament is sure to raise the question 
about the powers of the president, the Supreme Soviet and the 
government. The powers of local heads of administrations have 
not been determined either", he said.

  [Text] [Volodymyr Malynkovych] Leonid Kravchuk is 
apparently very tired. 
  The situation in the country is catastrophic, and he 
understands that if nothing changes it will even deteriorate. 
Additionally, his ratings have been declining recently. 
  He would most probably lose the elections. To resign means 
to at least save face. I believe that his decision is serious. 
  [Mykhaylo Horyn] Leonid Kravchuk understands that a new 
stage of the building of the Ukrainian state has begun, which 
requires that definitely new tactics be worked out. A new 
president is needed for new tactics. 
  [Oleksandr Moroz] Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk] has not yet 
officially announced that he will not run for president. If he 
decides to do so, this will be a politically correct act. The 
popularity of Leonid Kravchuk is decreasing. He and [Supreme 
Soviet Chairman] Ivan Plyushch are responsible for the failures 
of the Supreme Council. The refusal to participate in the 
elections is a political defeat, but participation in the 
elections would be an even bigger one for him, because he does 
not have any chances.

<F P=106> [UKRINFORM report: "A Meeting Between Members of the </F>
Ukrainian and Crimean Governments"] 
  [Text] Under the chairmanship of Ukraine's acting prime 
minister, Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers 
held a meeting to discuss the fulfillment of the Ukrainian 
president's commissions on the results of his talks with the 
president of the Crimean Republic. Those present included 
Ukraine's vice premiers Vasyl Yevtukhov, Valentyn Landyk, 
secretary of the Ukrainian presidential administration Mykola 
Khomenko, and other members of the government. The working 
group of the Crimean government was headed at the meeting by 
acting chairman of the Crimean Republic's Council of Ministers 
Anatoliy Franchuk. The participants in the conference 
considered and discussed a whole series of questions, including 
problems associated with the implementation of the agreement on 
budget relationships between the government of Ukraine and the

  [Text] The Cabinet of Ministers adopted a resolution on the 
1994 plan of Ukraine's social and economic development, the 
presidential cabinet press service reported. The plan 
specifies, in particular, the state contracts and orders 
amounts, including those of basic agricultural products and 
foods. It also specifies the amounts of centralized capital 
investments and new production facilities to be commissioned. 
  The plans reportedly contains provisions for enhancing state 
discipline by subjects of economic activities involving, in 
particular, pricing discipline in fuel supplies to Ukraine under 
intergovernmental agreements with exporter nations. 
  As the presidential cabinet press service disclosed, 
President Kravchuk provided a formal additional submission to 
the parliament of Ukraine's accedence to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 39 (529)] </F>
  [Text] The Ukrainian parliament has amended and enlarged 
the law on presidential elections adopted in 1991. 
  According to the amended law, candidacies to the 
presidential 
post shall be advanced by parties, inter-party blocs and 
electors' conferences. (The old law envisaged the advancement of 
candidates on their own initiative, or by worker groups - 
Interfax). 
  The advancement of candidates shall begin 3 months before 
and 
end 2 months before elections. A candidate that has collected 
100,000 signatures shall be allowed to run an election campaign. 
  The new law has a provision which obliges a candidate to 
collect at least 1,500 signatures in two thirds of the total 
number of electoral districts. Elections shall be held in 27 
electoral districts - in all regions and the cities of Kiev and 
Sevastopol. 
  A candidate who has scored more than half of the votes shall 
be considered elected to the post of president. Elections shall 
be considered valid if more than 50% of the electors take 
part 
in them. 
  If none of the candidates scores the required number of 
votes, a second round is held involving two candidates supported 
by the largest number of electors. During the second voting, a 
candidate who scores more "pros" than "cons" shall be considered 
elected to the presidential post. 
  Presidential elections shall be held on June 26. Ukrainian 
president Leonid Kravchuk announced this week that he would not 
run for presidency. 
  Explaining his decision, Kravchuk said that presidential 
elections should hardly be held just three months after 
parliamentary elections, scheduled for March 27. He pointed out 
that although he did not oppose the idea of presidential 
elections, he believes that amid the current economic crisis 
such prompt elections might overly politicize society. 
  The president's and Cabinet's press service circulated a 
statement which clarifies Leonid Kravchuk's position. 
  It says, among other things, that Kravchuk's position 
reflects the current situation and prospects for its development. 
  The president does not rule out, it goes on to say, that 
elections to parliament and executive bodies may go beyond the 
allotted time limit and overlap with early presidential 
elections and elections to the local governments, all of which 
may cause vacuum of power, whereby the old parliament would 
cease to exist, while a new parliament and cabinet would not be 
formed up. Given this, only president can run the state. If 
the president announces early elections in such a situation, the 
executive bodies may fall part and the reigns of state power 
might be utterly lost. 
  Meanwhile, RUKH [Ukrainian People's Movement for 
Perestroyka] 
leader Vyachesav Chernovil (Kravchuk's rival during the 
elections in December 1991 -- Interfax) qualified Kravchuk's 
refusal to run for presidency as a tactical game. "This does not 
mean that Kravchuk has firmly decided not to run for 
presidency," he told Interfax. He also said that the press 
service's statement does not say a word bout his refusal to 
participate in the election campaign and that Kravchuk's moves 
are aimed at undermining presidential elections, at least in 
June.

<F P=106> [Interview with Republic of Crimea Premier Yevgeniy Saburov </F>
by Vitaliy Golovachev; place and date not given: "Yevgeniy 
Saburov: `A Shortage of Common Sense and Professionalism'"] 
  [Text] Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov's proposal that the 
renowned economist Yevgeniy Saburov head the republic's 
government is being extensively commented on in the press. Not 
only is the fact of inviting a professional economist "from 
abroad" to take the post of premier interesting in itself, but 
so is the possibility of verifying in practice the efficacy of 
approaches to implementing reforms and overcoming the severest 
economic crisis other than those applied in Russia. 
  Saburov's name first became widely known when in August 1991 
he took up the post of deputy chairman of the RSFSR Council of 
Ministers, and minister of the economy in I. Silayev's 
government. He executed this role for just a few months, 
however, and he was not invited to join the new Gaydar 
"government of reforms." 
  Yevgeniy Fedorov is 48 years old. He was born in Yalta (his 
mother still lives there). He graduated from the Faculty of 
Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University, gained a 
profound knowledge of economics, and became the author of the 
economic program "Twelve Steps From the Abyss." He is a man of 
many interests, with a creative streak: He has published his 
own play, and he is fascinated by philosophy, and theology.... 
  He has been the director of the Center for Information and 
Social Technologies under the Russian Government since January 
1992. On becoming prime minister of the Crimean Government he 
decided to remain simultaneously the center's scientific leader: 
"The brain trust will help me resolve difficult problems...." 
  [Golovachev] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, to what extent has the 
experience of Russian reforms fitted you for Crimea? How do 
you, in general, evaluate what has happened in Russia in the 
space of two years? 
  [Saburov] The situation in which the Russian economy now 
finds itself is extremely complex. This, in my view, is the 
consequence of major errors committed while implementing 
reforms. What is most tiresome is that many errors could have 
been avoided, as the government was warned about them in 
advance; but, alas, the warnings were not heeded. 
  Take, for instance, the idea for the speedy integration of 
our economy into the world market system. In the overall scheme 
of things, this was an excellent, and right-minded idea -- there 
is no argument about this. At the same time, however, it would 
have been necessary to take account of the fact that our economy 
is self-devouring, "inverted." The main economic "bricks" -- 
prices, profitability, profit -- are not compatible with the 
world market. Because cheap raw materials, cheap transport, and 
a completely different price structure lay at the basis of 
accounting in our country. In Russia, whichever example you may 
take -- a sofa, a door handle, a gadget of some description -- 
everything, by foreign standards, is loss-making, and elsewhere 
they simply would not undertake to do this because, according to 
that system of accounting and price structure, it is not 
profitable. 
  Our reformers, of course, knew that the economy was 
"distorted," but they did not understand the most important 
thing: So monstrous is the extent of this distortion that no 
monetarist methods, no financial manipulations will aid 
"recovery" here. Yes, a rigid monetary and credit policy was 
essential. But at the same time, institutional changes 
concerning the infrastructure of the market, property, and so on 
were also required. This sort of thing cannot be done in a 
month, nor in three months. Without understanding all this, 
they tried overnight, and without pause for thought, to combine 
incompatible systems, and the result was the destruction of the 
economy.... 
  [Golovachev] Do you believe that there was an alternative 
route to the market? 
  [Saburov] It is not just that I believe this, but economic 
theory and the experience of other countries indicates this. To 
be brief, it was necessary from the very outset to apply a 
well-known tactic which is called "Go and Stop, Stop and Go." 
That is, to go part of the way, stop, adjust, and then move on. 
  It is easy to see that we are talking about a gradual, more 
harmonious restructuring of the economy. Take, for instance, 
the fact that the correlation of prices has altered. The price 
structure is, indeed, different, but it is still far from the 
foreign mold. Now the economy must be given a chance to adapt 
to these new prices, and specific structural changes in industry 
must take place.... 
  [Golovachev] This is all very well in theory. But what 
about in practice? Prices were deregulated 2 January 1992, and 
they took off [oni i poshli]. So what you are saying to them is 
-- stop, take time to adapt, and then we will move further.... 
  [Saburov] But why just talk when it is essential to act? It 
is necessary to conduct reforms on the basis of a pact of 
national accord. All social forces should agree on price 
reform, and on the most important stages. A situation whereby 
certain sectors, enjoying a monopoly position and the fact that 
it is impossible to manage without their products, pump up 
prices, profitability, and earnings for their workers while 
other sectors end up in a state of collapse and impoverishment 
-- this is not what it is about at all. To avoid this, it was 
essential from the very outset to agree a restriction on the 
transition period for income growth, a restriction on 
profitability, and a number of other important things (including 
the "currency anchor," that is, smoothing out the fluctuations 
in the ruble rate against the dollar). 
  I am speaking precisely of a voluntary, conscious agreement, 
because you will achieve nothing through an order "from above." 
For 70 years directors learned how to deceive all controllers, 
how to get around any rules. So what is needed is 
self-regulation (within sensible, agreed frameworks) under the 
eye of the state. This will help to slow down inflation, and to 
render the process manageable. 
  But the reformers embarked on quite a different path. You 
will remember the declaration of market prices and market wages. 
This was a splendid slogan, but a profoundly erroneous 
approach. The market does not exist yet, and market regulators 
do not operate -- that is, prices will not be balanced by the 
market, but "blown off course," and wages for some will be 
enormous while for others they will be miserly. A sizable wage, 
like an engine, will ultimately create a momentum in its wake, 
dragging along with it the salaries in other sectors -- and an 
inflationary spiral is guaranteed. 
  In the majority of countries which have attained success in 
the economy it is obligatory at a specific stage to implement 
sensible restrictions on the growth of incomes and 
profitability. This, incidentally, was one of the fundamental 
points of Balcerowicz's program in Poland. But in Russia, for 
some reason, they decided to be "cleverer" than all the rest. 
Today, we are reaping the results.... 
  [Golovachev] But how is it possible to restrict income even 
further, when one-third of the country is already on the poverty 
line? 
  [Saburov] This is precisely the result of the fact that 
there was no well-conceived incomes policy, there were no 
restrictions: some sectors "got fat," and others are on the 
brink of extinction. 
  Of course, the "Stop and Go" tactic -- with its pauses, its 
delays -- will not be ideal. But the economy needs a breather, 
it needs time to adapt. It is better to move slowly but surely 
toward a goal than to charge at something head on and find 
yourself in a dead end. Obviously, the former is far harder: 
It requires daily, difficult, and painstaking work, great 
skill, and professionalism -- and not only in the economic 
sphere but also in the sphere of management. However, the road 
to success is never easy.... 
  [Golovachev] Okay, what is done is done. But how do we get 
out of the crisis today? Nonpayments have almost paralyzed the 
economy. If you print a heap of money, you will present 
enterprises with hyperinflation. If you do not, the result is a 
financial clinch, production stoppage, and mass unemployment. 
What is the solution? 
  [Saburov] Indeed, it is always harder to extinguish a 
full-blown conflagration than a small fire. But we must not, of 
course, lose heart. Right now it is essential to steer the ship 
with particular caution and the greatest of dexterity. Credit 
must be issued very sparingly -- by no means to everybody -- and 
for specific projects (not flimsy "rough sketches," but genuine 
business plans.) Moreover, it should be issued under strict 
controls. 
  And there should be urgent talks between the government and 
the sectors, and between sectors and the various social forces, 
on the new "rules of the game": a temporary restriction on 
income growth, profitability, and so on. A great deal depends 
upon the professionalism of the government -- it must come out 
with very precise, specific proposals, so that it is clear what 
needs to be agreed.... 
  [Golovachev] In your view, is the economic situation in 
Crimea better or worse than in Russia? 
  [Saburov] Worse, of course. A lot worse. There are bread 
lines, there is poverty, electricity is cut off for long periods 
at a time, health sanatoriums are not heated.... 
  [Golovachev] Can you employ in Crimea the "Stop and Go" 
tactic and other recommendations you have mentioned? 
  [Saburov] It is difficult to compare conditions for the 
pursuit of reforms in Crimea and Russia. There is no Central 
Bank in Crimea, and the Crimean Republic on its own is in no 
position to rein in the devaluation of the currency (although we 
will, of course, try to exert influence, pressure if you like, 
on the Central Bank of Ukraine). Economic instruments in 
conducting reforms are all we can use, as there are no others. 
  [Golovachev] Will the Russian ruble circulate officially in 
Crimea? 
  [Saburov] This would be sensible. And to some extent this 
situation already exists "de facto." However, it is vital to 
work out mutually acceptable projections. 
  [Golovachev] How much Russian currency will be required? 
  [Saburov] It is hard to say. It is essential to bear in 
mind that money for investments is one thing, and money in 
current circulation is another.... But, in general, we could be 
talking about hundreds of billions of rubles. 
  [Golovachev] Do you intend to bring in foreign capital? 
  [Saburov] Yes, and we will do everything possible to bring 
this about. It is a matter of approaching banks and 
entrepreneurs in distant foreign countries, and in Russia. 
Their activity will be granted most-favored status. This 
concerns taxes, customs policy, and much more. It is very 
important to guarantee stability in the sphere of legislation 
and finances. It is wrong to alter the laws every quarter. If 
we create attractive, advantageous conditions, capital will come 
flooding into Crimea. After all, this is a prosperous region, 
one of the best resort locations, and it has considerable 
industrial, scientific, and agricultural potential. 
  Particular attention will be given to creating new and 
maintaining existing jobs, revitalizing sanatorium facilities 
and local industry, producing competitive goods, and developing 
the vacation industry and tourism.... 
  [Golovachev] You talked to Russian Premier Viktor 
Chernomyrdin a few days ago. What was your conversation about? 
  [Saburov] It was about the need to restore economic links 
between Russia and Crimea, the possibilities for more extensive 
Russian interest in vacationing in Crimea, and other questions. 
  [Golovachev] Nowadays only millionaires can take a vacation 
in Crimean health sanatoriums..... 
  [Saburov] But why? There are Russian enterprises which pay 
for trips (either completely, or in part) and send their workers 
to Crimea. Moreover, this is cheaper than flying to Miami, 
where, as TRUD reported, Russian oil workers are taking their 
vacations. At the same time, there is quality medical provision 
available in Crimean sanatoriums, which you cannot get abroad. 
  [Golovachev] A few days ago, an official in Kiev announced 
that a citizen of another country (that is, you) cannot be prime 
minister of the Crimean Government inasmuch as a foreigner 
should not be given access to state secrets.... 
  [Saburov] This is simply ludicrous. What state secrets are 
there in Crimea? A ravaged economy? People have known about 
that for a long time.... And what kind of "foreigner" am I? I 
was born and raised in Crimea, and I have never considered 
myself to be a "foreigner" there. 
  [Golovachev] When do you leave for your new job in 
Simferopol? 
  [Saburov] In the next few days. 
  [Golovachev] Now for a few purely personal questions. Are 
you a religious man? 
  [Saburov] Yes. 
  [Golovachev] I was told that you were christened by Father 
Aleksandr Men.... 
  [Saburov] This was a great moment for me. Incidentally, 
this happened in 1968 -- at a time when the official authorities 
did not look upon the church particularly favorably. 
  [Golovachev] You realized, of course, that you would no 
longer be able to pursue a scientific career? 
  [Saburov] Just what is meant by a scientific career? I knew 
that I, as a nonparty individual, would not climb any higher 
than "lab chief" in the institute. This was my "ceiling." But 
the scientific work I did do was pretty good. 
  [Golovachev] You write plays, poetry. How well do the 
precise sciences -- mathematics and economics -- mix with the 
unfettered imagination without which poetry is impossible? 
  [Saburov] They mix very well. Poetic thinking is very 
specific. The poet sees not simply a bird but something quite 
specific -- for instance, a white crane, sitting in a nest. On 
the other hand, economics is a very "creative" science. Indeed, 
is it a science at all? So in this sense I can see a 
combination, a harmony of interests, and not their differences. 
Incidentally, many poets in the pre-Soviet era occupied 
government posts.... 
  [Golovachev] And one final question. How do you view the 
future -- more with optimism, or with pessimism? Will we get 
ourselves out of this rut without bloodshed, and without 
concentration camps? 
  [Saburov] We have to. People have become highly resistent 
to "blood and concentration camps." And you cannot reverse the 
course of history. We are merely required to make fewer errors. 
Right now, an acute shortage of common sense and 
professionalism is seen in the conduct of the reforms. But I am 
convinced: Common sense will triumph, and good will be 
victorious....

  [Text] A need for cooperation between Latvia and Poland-- 
countries brought together both by their similar past and by 
common problems they face today--was emphasized by President 
Lech Walesa speaking in the forum of the Latvian parliament. 
According to the Polish president both countries are natural 
allies along the road to European integration. 
  Walesa emphasized that there were no historical burdens 
between the two countries. He recalled that the Polish 
government had never recognized Latvia's annexation by the 
Soviet Union, thanks to which Polish-Latvian relations could 
simply be resumed in the autumn of 1991. 
  The basis for good Polish-Latvian cooperation is the 
inter-state treaty signed in July 1992, but according to Walesa 
this needs to be filled with concrete substance. In his view 
there is need for direct contacts between people. The president 
stressed that Poles resident in Lithuania were our country's 
natural ambassador in Latvia. He expressed his satisfaction 
with the fact that the Latvian authorities have guaranteed the 
possibility of unrestricted development and preservation of 
national identity for the Polish minority. 
  Among others Walesa met were parliamentary chairman 
Anatolijs 
Gorbunovs. The schedule of the Polish president's visit to Riga 
calls for further meetings with the ministers of defense and of 
foreign affairs, and another meeting with President Guntis 
Ulmanis.

<F P=106> [Article by Morris Posse: "Russia Dissolves Gas Delivery </F>
Agreement With Latvia"] 
  [Text] Riga, 11 Feb -- The Russian joint stock company 
"Gazprom," without giving reasons, has dissolved the contract 
with the state joint stock company "Latvijas gaze" (LG) on 
natural gas deliveries for the current year, LG Vice President 
Girts Stelbovics informed journalists at a press conference 
organized by leading Latvian energy experts. Agreements have 
been dissolved also with Lithuania and Estonia. For the purpose 
of signing new agreements, a 14-member Russian delegation is 
scheduled to arrive in Latvia. 
  At the same time, the president of the state joint stock 
company "Latvenergo" Gunars Koemecs stated that the Riga 
municipal authorities have settled only 54 percent of their 
accounts for the consumed heat. His enterprise has not received 
payment for heating of apartments and for hot water amounting to 
6 million lats. Due to the cold weather in February, the sum of 
the debts may increase by one third, Koemecs said. 
  G. Stelbovics also said that the main reason for the 
"Gazprom" action is the fact that LG owes 23 million USD to the 
Russian enterprise. The problem will be resolved during the next 
few days, because the Latvian Cabinet of Ministers has accepted 
the payment of this sum to LG, from the credit of the European 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 
  Although the decision of the Cabinet states that the money 
is 
slated for necessary gas supplies in the summer, G. Stelbovics 
has told DIENA that the money will go toward covering the debt. 
The large debts of LG result from the fact that the debtors do 
not pay for the consumed gas -- the total sum of debts on 1 
February amounted to 49 million lats. 
  At least 80,000 USD will be necessary for purchasing gas in 
the summer. To receive such a sum, there are talks being 
conducted by different foreign commercial banks and other 
financial structures, DIENA was told by G. Stelbovics. 
  It seems alarming that such a numerous delegation is coming 
to Latvia, said the state minister of energetics, Andris 
Kreslins. The reasons might become known after the visit of the 
representatives of the state gas enterprises of the three Baltic 
countries to Moscow in the next few days. It is also not known 
what the conditions and prices proposed by Russian 
representatives will be, and what effect they will have on 
Latvia's economy and people.

  [Text] The letter Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent to 
Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis was "misread" by the aides of 
the Latvian head of state and mass media, Aleksandr Udaltsov, 
who is in charge of relations with the Baltic countries in the 
Russian Foreign Ministry, told Interfax. 
  In his words, the Latvian interpretation of the letter is 
that the Russian president called on the Latvian leader to meet 
and iron out differences. 
  "Nothing can be farther from the truth. The letter is 
chiefly about the position of the Russian-speaking population in 
Latvia. It expressed Russia's serious concern over that," the 
diplomat said. 
  He explained that only in the beginning of the letter did 
the 
Russian president confirm his willingness to have a summit 
meeting to discuss a broad range of issues and sign agreements 
on troop withdrawal, social guarantees for Russian military 
pensioners and the functioning of the Skrunda radar station. 
  "The ironing out of formulations in international agreements 
is not the function of presidents. It is apparent from 
Yeltsin's letter that the summit is impossible unless 
negotiating teams agree on key provisions of bilateral 
documents," Udaltsov said.

  [Text] Moscow, 25 Feb -- Three Russian Army servicemen were 
attacked in Riga today by unknown assailants and were taken to 
military hospital in a serious condition. An ITAR-TASS 
correspondent learned from military sources in the Latvian 
capital that the three servicemen on leave from the Riga 
garrison -- a sergeant and two privates -- were badly beaten up. 
Two of the servicemen have concussion and the one of the 
privates was stabbed in the abdomen. 
  The command of the Russian troops in the Baltics has 
appealed 
to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the republic to take 
measures to investigate the incident. 
  Under Russian legislation, in this case the law-enforcement 
bodies of Latvia should launch criminal proceedings and carry 
out an investigation.

  [Text] [Announcer] On Friday, at the Latvian Foreign 
Ministry, there was a press briefing about Latvia's developing 
relations with Israel and the Middle East, as well as Latvia's 
attitude to Ukraine's concepts of foreign policy. On 14 January 
this year in Moscow, the presidents of Ukraine, the United 
States, and Russia issued a statement that the problem of 
nuclear weapons located in Ukraine is for the whole world to 
solve. But on 3 February, Ukraine's Supreme Council adopted a 
resolution to accede to the Lisbon Protocol. The press 
secretary of the Latvian Foreign Ministry, Ivars (?Embrekts), 
pointed out: 
  [Begin Embrekts recording] The Foreign Ministry of the 
Republic of Latvia believes that such action by the president 
and Supreme Council of Ukraine demonstrates to the world 
community Ukraine's goodwill and serious intention to promote 
the disarmament process, and that it is a significant investment 
in ensuring peace and world security. We hold in high esteem 
Ukraine's stance in the sphere of nuclear disarmament, and (?in 
wishing to regard) Ukraine as a (?powerful) and friendly 
country, Latvia supports the view of the Ukrainian president, 
that in our modern world a country's security is dependent not 
only, and not even so much, on its military potential, as on the 
successful development of its economy. Latvia (?believes in) 
Ukraine's state consolidation and economic prosperity. The 
Foreign Ministry has the conviction that the position of the 
Ukrainian president and Supreme Council on the issue of nuclear 
disarmament will not only strengthen peace and international 
security, but will also assist Ukraine to overcome its economic 
and internal policy difficulties. [end recording]

  [Text] Moscow February 25 TASS -- The Russian Federation 
Council, upper house of the Russian Parliament, approved 
dispatching an additional military contingent, numbering 300, to 
join U.N. peace-keeping forces deployed in former Yugoslavia to 
ensure control over the unconditional observance by the warring 
sides of a ceasefire agreement in the area of Sarajevo. 
  This problem was discussed by the upper chamber of the 
Russian Parliament in connection with the Russian president's 
address to the nation in response to the U.N. secretary 
general's appeal asking Russia to send an additional military 
contingent to former Yugoslavia. 
  The session of the upper chamber of the Russian Parliament 
was attended by representatives of the Russian Defence and 
Foreign Ministries, federal departments, a counter-intelligence 
department and a department for emergency situations. In 
accordance with the Russian Constitution, "a decision on the 
possibility of the use of the Russian Armed Forces outside 
Russia's territory" is within the competence of the Russian 
Federation Council. 
  A resolution passed by the Federation Council instructs the 
Russian Government to resolve problems connected with the 
formation of a corresponding military contingent on a voluntary 
basis and on terms envisaged by the resolution of the Russian 
Parliament of March 6, 1992. 
  The Russian Government was also instructed to urgently 
resolve the problem of giving a pay rise to the personnel of the 
Russian contingent. 
  Under the resolution, the Russian Defence Ministry, shall, 
jointly with the Russian Foreign Ministry, create a system of 
measures providing social guarantees to the Russian personnel 
taking part in peace-keeping operations in former Yugoslavia and 
coordinate these measures with the U.N. secretariat. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry was instructed to institute 
additional posts for Russian officers in the headquarters of the 
U.N. peace-keeping forces. The Federation Council drew 
attention to the fact that it is necessary to step up the work 
of corresponding departments for the ultimate solution of the 
Bosnian crisis by political means.

  [Text] Moscow, 26 Feb -- Federation Council deputies today 
approved Vladimir Nikitov as head of the chamber's 
administration. The 43-year-old candidate of technical sciences 
was adviser to Vladimir Shumeyko when he was first deputy 
chairman of the government. He has also had considerable 
experience of working in the Supreme Soviet. 
  In reply to deputies' questions about guaranteeing their 
parliamentary activity, Vladimir Nikitov said, in particular, 
that the question of deputies' badges had not yet been decided. 
The matter is being held up because of their cost: The proposed 
draft badge containing precious metals will cost half a million 
[currency not specified].

  [Text] Moscow February 25 TASS -- A report of the 
Federation Council's Commission for Studies of the situation in 
Northern ossetia and Ingushetia was presented today to the Upper 
Chamber of the Russian Parliament by Commission head Valeriy 
Fateyev. 
  In his opinion, the main regional problem is refugees. 
Fateyev stressed the Ingush and North ossetian presidents can 
agree between themselves on the return of refugees to places of 
their permanent residence. 
  North Ossetian president Akhsarbek galazov supported the 
pronouncement and said "the interested sides should have a 
chance to agree between themselves and the federal bodies should 
listen to the opinion of regional representatives". He added 
they have agreed with Ingush leader Ruslan Aushev on further 
negotiations. 
  Aushev agreed with Galazov, but said "they should remember 
about refugees". In his words, the participation in the 
conciliatory commission has brought no results and the North 
Ossetian president should name the exact date of his solution of 
the Ingush refugee problem. 
  The Russian Parliament deputies decided to continue the 
problem analysis in committees and discuss their proposals at 
the chamber meeting.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 26 TASS -- The third meeting of the 
Russian Federation Council, which lasted for only three days, 
has shown "the chamber proceeds from the urgent needs and its 
ability to help the reforms with laws," Council Speaker Vladimir 
Shumeyko told an exclusive ITAR-TASS interview. 
  A reason for active work of the chamber is the "absence of 
factionalism and division on party principle. It is not 
important for us who suggests a proposal if the latter is good," 
he said. 
  In the words of Shumeyko, the presidential message to the 
Federal Assembly will be discussed at a council plenary 
scheduled for March 15. The deputies have discussed some 
problems related to the message, including a resolution on 
measures against crime in the Russian Federation. 
  The deputies believe that order is even more important than 
the economic reform. In their opinion, it is a "comprehensive 
problem that starts from the question of power". They favor the 
creation of a solid system of vertical power in order to control 
implementation of resolutions. 
  Shumeyko thinks that anti-crime measures include aspects of 
the economic reform. While the old system has been ruined and a 
new one has not been formed, the use of laws to expand criminal 
activities should be prevented. 
  These also include the border issue which is to be settled 
by 
the Federation Council. Unestablished borders enable any person 
to penetrate into the Russian Federation and carry arms or drugs. 
  The introduction of a state of emergency is another 
prerogative of the upper parliament chamber. A lot of arms have 
been accumulated in the state of emergency zones, which also 
results in the increased crime rate. Shumeyko does not exclude 
parliamentary hearings on enhanced measures against crime may 
result in the parliament's proposal to the president to 
introduce the state of emergency in some Russian areas in order 
to remove arms from the residents.

Duma "On the Procedure for Implementing the Decree `On Declaring 
an Amnesty in Connection With the Adoption of the Russian 
Federation Constitution'"] 
  [Text] 1. Responsibility for the implementation of the 
Russian Federation Federal Assembly State Duma Decree "On 
Declaring an Amnesty in Connection With the Adoption of the 
Russian Federation Constitution" (hereinafter referred to as the 
amnesty decree) is placed: 
  (a) on the bodies responsible for enforcing punishment -- 
for convicted persons kept in places of detention. 
  Implementation of the amnesty decree is effected in 
accordance with a decision of the chief of the corrective labor 
institution sanctioned by a prosecutor. The following are 
attached to this decision: a record of rewards and sanctions, 
the convicted person's personal file, and other documents needed 
to decide on the application of an act of amnesty; 
  (b) on inquiry and preliminary investigation bodies -- for 
persons whose cases and documents on whose crimes are being 
processed by these bodies; 
  (c) on courts: 
  for persons whose cases and documents on whose crimes are 
being processed by the courts and had not been examined prior to 
the entry into force of the amnesty decree, and also for persons 
whose criminal cases have been examined but sentences have not 
come legally into force; 
  for convicted persons for whom the enforcement of sentences 
has been deferred in instances and under the procedure 
stipulated by law and persons who have received a conditional 
sentence in accordance with Article 44 of the RSFSR Criminal 
Code (the question of the application of an act of amnesty is 
decided by a court following a submission by the internal 
affairs body monitoring the convicted person's conduct); 
  for persons sentenced to be fined, if the fine has not been 
paid prior to the entry into force of the amnesty decree (the 
question of the application of an act of amnesty is decided by 
the court which passed sentence); 
  for persons released on parole and persons who have had the 
unserved part of their sentence commuted prior to the coming 
into force of the amnesty decree (the question of the 
application of an act of amnesty is decided by the court which 
made the ruling to allow parole or commute the unserved part of 
a sentence); 
  for persons sentenced by Russian Federation courts who are 
serving their sentence on the territory of other states which 
were formerly part of the USSR (a ruling on the application of 
an act of amnesty is made by the court which passed sentence); 
  (d) on internal affairs bodies: 
  for persons whose sentences have come legally into force and 
who have been sentenced to imprisonment but who are not in 
custody; 
  for persons serving their sentence in the form of corrective 
work not involving custody or disqualification from the holding 
of given posts or from given activities; 
  (e) on the commands of disciplinary battalions -- for 
servicemen sentenced to be assigned to a disciplinary battalion. 
  2. A decision on the application or nonapplication of an act 
of amnesty is adopted for each person individually. In the 
absence of necessary information on the convicted person 
examination of the question of the application of an amnesty is 
deferred pending the receipt of additional materials. 
  Bodies responsible for the implementation of the amnesty 
decree are granted the right to demand that the institutions in 
question provide court files and other materials needed to 
decide questions linked with the application of an amnesty. 
Such demands must be met immediately. 
  3. Decisions on the application of an act of amnesty adopted 
by inquiry and preliminary investigation bodies, internal 
affairs bodies, and also the commands of disciplinary battalions 
are sanctioned by a prosecutor. 
  When an act of amnesty is applied by courts the 
participation 
of a prosecutor is mandatory. 
  4. The amnesty decree applies to persons who committed 
crimes prior to the entry into force of the present decree. 
  5. It is to be explained that when an act of amnesty is 
applied: 
  (a) subparagraph "a" of paragraph 1 of the amnesty decree 
applies to persons who: 
  served as a serviceman or a civilian in the USSR Armed 
Forces 
during the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945; 
  participated in the Great Patriotic War as a member of a 
partisan detachment, people's volunteer militia, extermination 
battalion, or underground organization operating against the 
German occupationists; 
  served as a serviceman or a civilian in the USSR Armed 
Forces 
which participated in combat operations against Japan in 1945. 
  Subparagraph "a" of paragraph 1 of the amnesty decree 
applies 
to persons awarded the "Victory Over Germany in the Great 
Patriotic War of 1941-45" medal or the "Victory Over Japan" 
medal and also to persons who participated in combat operations 
to defend the interests of the USSR during the period preceding 
the Great Patriotic War or after it ended; to persons who 
participated in eliminating the consequences of the Chernobyl 
AES accident and are entitled to special benefits; and also to 
persons who have performed military service on the territory of 
the Transcaucasus and Baltic states and the Republic of 
Tajikistan; 
  (b) subparagraph "b" of paragraph 1 of the amnesty decree 
also applies to female minors; 
  (c) subparagraph "c" of paragraph 1 of the amnesty decree 
applies to males born before 1 January 1934; 
  (d) subparagraph "d" of paragraph 1 of the amnesty decree 
applies to persons deemed by the Medical and Labor Expert 
Commission of the Russian Federation Ministry for the Social 
Protection of the Population to be Group 1 and Group 2 invalids 
prior to the coming into force of this decree, and also to 
persons deemed by a Medical and Labor Commission of a Russian 
Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs medical department to be 
Group 1 or Group 2 invalids, following confirmation of the group 
by a commission of the Medical and Labor Expert Commission of 
the Russian Federation Ministry for the Social Protection of the 
Population within six months of the entry into force of the 
amnesty decree; 
  (e) paragraph 2 of the amnesty decree does not apply to 
persons who, in addition to a crime committed through 
negligence, have also been convicted of a crime committed 
deliberately; 
  (f) paragraph 3 of the amnesty decree applies to males born 
after 1 January 1976; 
  (g) the served part of a sentence stipulated in paragraphs 2 
and 5 of the amnesty decree is calculated to the date that the 
present decree comes into force. 
  6. The serving of a sentence in the form of noncustodial 
corrective work ends from the day that internal affairs bodies 
file a decision on the application of an act of amnesty approved 
by a prosecutor. 
  7. The amnesty decree does not extend to persons subject to 
administrative punishment, including persons culpable under 
administrative law but freed from criminal liability in 
accordance with the procedure stipulated by Articles 50 and 51 
of the RSFSR Criminal Code. 
  8. When applying an act of amnesty to persons whose length 
of sentence has been reduced by pardon or amnesty, it is 
necessary to proceed from the length of sentence prescribed in 
accordance with the acts of pardon or amnesty. 
  9. Amnestied persons are released from both their basic 
punishment and additional punishment if the latter has not been 
carried out by the date that the amnesty decree comes into force. 
  10. In accordance with paragraph 7 of the amnesty decree the 
part of the sentence which has not been served on the date that 
the said decree comes into forces is eligible for reduction. 
This point applies to convicted persons whose sentences have 
entered legally into force prior to the entry into force of the 
said decree. 
  11. When applying the amnesty decree convictions which have 
been quashed or lifted in accordance with the procedure 
stipulated by law and also convictions for crimes which have 
been excised from the RSFSR Criminal Code are disregarded. 
Furthermore, the convictions of persons previously convicted 
for crimes of negligence, irrespective of the form of 
punishment, and also of persons sentenced for premediated crimes 
to noncustodial punishment are disregarded. 
  12. Malicious violators of the terms [governing the serving 
of their sentence] are to be defined as persons who: 
  (a) systematically violate established discipline and order 
while serving their sentence; 
  (b) have been convicted, interned in deportation colonies, 
or 
sent to other types of corrective labor colonies if, after the 
court ruling that they be sent to a corrective labor 
institution, they have been in custody for less than one year on 
the day that the materials relating to the application of an act 
of amnesty is examined. The term is calculated from the date 
that the convicted person is taken into custody; 
  (c) persons sentenced to noncustodial corrective work who, 
because they have deliberately evaded serving their sentence, 
have their unserved term of corrective work replaced by a 
custodial sentence, if they have been in custody for less than 
six months on the date that the materials relating to the 
application of an act of amnesty are examined. 
  13. In accordance with subparagraph "e" of paragraph 8 of 
the amnesty decree an act of amnesty cannot be applied to 
persons released early from custody since 1985 (irrespective of 
whether their conviction has been quashed or lifted) under the 
pardons procedure or on the basis of the USSR Supreme Soviet 
Presidium decrees: 
  "On an Amnesty in Connection With the 40th Anniversary of 
the 
Soviet People's Victory in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-45," 
dated 26 April 1985; 
  "On the Release From Detention of Certain Categories of 
Women," dated 6 November 1986; 
  "On an Amnesty in Connection With the 70th Anniversary of 
the 
Great October Socialist Revolution," dated 18 June 1987; 
  and also on the basis of the USSR Supreme Soviet decree of 
28 
November 1989 "On an Amnesty for Former Servicemen of the 
Contingent of Soviet Forces in Afghanistan Who Have Committed 
Crimes," the USSR law of 1 November 1991 "On an Amnesty for 
Servicemen Who Have Evaded Military Service," and the Russian 
Federation Supreme Soviet decree of 18 June 1992 "On an Amnesty." 
  Convicted persons who have been released in connection with 
the reduction of their sentence under the pardons procedure or 
on the basis of the aforementioned acts and persons who have had 
the unserved part of a term of detention commuted should also be 
regarded as having been granted early release from punishment. 
  14. Materials relating to persons affected by the amnesty 
decree who have had been ordered under the prescribed procedure 
to undergo treatment for alcoholism, drug addiction, or venereal 
disease are examined after the convicted persons have completed 
the complete course of treatment but no later than six months 
after the completion of the implementation of the amnesty decree. 
  The grounds for deeming that a course of treatment for 
venereal disease has been completed are a medical ruling or -- 
in the case of persons for whom a court has prescribed 
compulsory treatment for alcoholism or drug addiction -- a court 
ruling on terminating the compulsory treatment. 
  15. The amnesty decree also applies to persons who were 
convicted by USSR courts on the territory of another state and 
are serving their sentence on the territory of the Russian 
Federation. 
  16. In cases when the question of the application of an act 
of amnesty arises after the expiry of a six-month period from 
the day that the amnesty decree comes into force, application of 
the act is effected in accordance with the procedure stipulated 
by paragraph 1 of the said decree. 
  17. The regulation personnel strength of corrective labor 
institutions and remand centers and also of the prisoner escort 
service is not to be reduced. 
  18. Organs of executive power of the components of the 
Russian Federation are to ensure monitoring of the 
implementation of the amnesty decree. 
  19. Organs of local self-government in cities and rayons are 
to: 
  (a) organize prompt record-keeping on all persons released 
from punishment on the basis of the amnesty decree and make 
everyday and job arrangements for them no later that 15 days 
after they arrive in their place of residence; 
  (b) find places in homes for the disabled for invalids and 
elderly persons who have been released from punishment and do 
not have relatives able to support them. 
  20. Organs of local self-government in cities and rayons are 
to ensure that juveniles released from punishment on the basis 
of the amnesty decree are promptly included in their records 
when they arrive in their place of residence, passed into the 
supervision of parents or guardianship and wardship agencies, 
and found places when necessary in children's homes, boarding 
schools, or vocational and technical colleges and to coordinate 
the work of commissions for juvenile affairs, internal affairs 
bodies, and social organizations to reeducate juveniles released 
from punishment.

  [Text] Vilnius, Feb 25, ELTA -- "There is no necessity to 
stop the second reactor of Ignalina nuclear plant", Povilas 
Vaisnys, head of Lithuania's State Nuclear Agency Inspectorate 
VATESI, told ELTA. 
  "If Lithuania had troubles to get electricity from other 
sources, the reactor would not be stopped", he said. 
  A little amount of steam can leak because of bad sealed 
measurers of flow in the technological channel. It does not 
hinder safe exploitation of the reactor at all, Vaisnys said. 
  Anyway, the reactor is to be stopped on Friday, 9.00 p.m. 
Vaisnys said there was a need to know the reasons even of such a 
little radioactive leak. 
  He mentioned one more reason of the stoppage - the first 
reactor is due to be stopped next month for routine repairs and 
"we need to be sure the second reactor operates without 
problems".

  [Text] Chisinau Radio reports that at a news conference, 
President Mircea Snegur affirmed that he accepts a mediation 
offer made by Russia in connection with the Dniester problem, 
provided that Moldova does not put a finalized document on the 
table. President Mircea Snegur announced that he has received a 
mediation proposal from Boris Yeltsin and that a Moscow envoy 
will arrive in Chisinau after tomorrow's parliamentary elections. 
  Insofar as relations with the CIS are concerned, Snegur 
expressed the hope that the future parliament will ratify 
Moldova's adherence to this community, but said that the problem 
of signing certain accords with it in the area of defense is not 
in question. 
  He also added that he wants the Russian 14th Army to begin 
its withdrawal from the territory of the Republic of Moldova 
this year. 
  The ambassador in Moscow, Anatol Taranu, told the INTERFAX 
agency that at the beginning of March, a working meeting will be 
held in Chisinau by military experts from Moldova and Russia to 
clarify the status of the Russian 14th Army, as well as methods 
and a timetable for its withdrawal from the territory of 
Moldova. 
  He also mentioned that Chisinau will insist on the 
withdrawal 
of the 14th Army from Dniester by 1 July. This piece of news 
was also broadcast by Rossiya radio.

  [Text] During a meeting with foreign journalists, Mircea 
Snegur, president of the Republic of Moldova, examined the 
social and political situation in the country on the eve of the 
27 February elections and said that it is very unlikely that the 
elections will fail to produce a majority capable of putting 
together a new government. He said that, if no consensus is 
reached, a parliamentary crisis will be solved through 
democratic means. 
  Mircea Snegur said that the terms for the withdrawal of the 
14th Army cannot be made conditional on granting special legal 
status to the rayons on the left bank of the Dniester River and 
added that the secessionists are supported by pro-imperial 
forces, but that the revitalization of the empire can be ruled 
out. 
  The president of the Republic of Moldova reiterated the 
intention to sign the 'Partnership for Peace' program, after the 
public opinion poll scheduled for 6 March. Regarding the 
national army, he ruled out the possibility that it will be 
liquidated by a decision of the future parliament -- our 
Chisinau correspondent Anca Florea reports, citing the press 
service of the presidency.

  [Text] Early parliamentary elections will be held in 
Moldova tomorrow, 27 February. Our special correspondents in 
Chisinau report as follows: 
  [Begin Anca Florea recording] This morning, Chisinau Radio 
broadcast an interview granted by President Mircea Snegur. The 
questions and especially the answers convey the preelectoral 
picture of the Republic of Moldova. We will try to sum up what 
he said. 
  President Snegur assessed that the 27 February elections are 
linked to the opinion poll on 6 March. The first will create a 
parliament, the second an answer to a complex question that will 
form the foundation of the Constitution. 
  He called on the citizens of the Republic of Moldova to cast 
their vote urging them not to be indifferent to their fate, 
although, quote, even a small percentage will ensure the 
validation of the elections, unquote. 
  President Snegur expressed the hope that a parliamentary 
majority will be achieved, which, quote, could work actively, 
without useless discussions, unquote. Western interest in this 
country was explained by the President of the Republic of 
Moldova through the preservation of stability in a conflict area 
in the past one and a half years, contrary to other areas of 
conflict in the former Soviet Union, where this was not 
possible. He added that the separatist tendencies are also of 
interest, especially for the foreign observers who have arrived 
in Chisinau. 
  In connection with future relations with the future 
parliament, President Snegur said, quote: No parliament will be 
able to cooperate with the president if it tries to promote a 
more or less conservative line or to stop the reform process, 
unquote. 
  This is why President Snegur emphasizes the need to create a 
parliamentary majority. 
  The first event that will follow the elections is the 
signing 
of the 'Partnership for Peace' program in Brussels and the 
signing of the documents on its entry in the CIS, President 
Mircea Snegur affirmed. 
  Asked about the participation of the Gagauz people in the 
elections, the president of the Republic of Moldova affirmed 
that the differences with the separatists can be solved only 
through conciliation, quote: I am firmly convinced that solely 
compromise will help us reestablish the republic's integrity, 
unquote. 
  In connection with the current political, economic, and 
social situation of the Republic of Moldova, President Snegur 
stated that the people belonging to the nomenklatura are not the 
only guilty ones. He said, quote: The nomenklatura are those 
who are working, who are still able to do something, and 
therefore I do not agree with promoting the idea of only new 
people. We have had a revolutionary government, a reformist 
government, and a national reconciliation government. What the 
revolutionaries achieved in one year can be noted today: Ever 
since 1990-91 we have been unable to recover our senses because 
there was only destruction, unquote. 
  In concluding his interview granted to Chisinau radio 
stations, President Snegur did not reject the idea of a 
presidential republic, if necessary, reiterating that without a 
parliamentary majority there are no prospects. 
  As a general assessment, President Mircea Snegur said, 
quote: 
We have to be optimistic and compare the situation in the 
Republic of Moldova with the situation in other countries within 
the area of the former Soviet Union. Being supported by 
international bodies, we hope that we will elect a parliament 
which, in cooperation with the presidency, will give an impetus 
to the positive beginning which exists in the Republic of 
Moldova. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Anca Florea report from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] A group of 40 international observers representing 
the Council of Europe and the CSCE, in the Republic of Moldova 
to monitor the early parliamentary elections, visited Tiraspol 
today. The group of observers, of which nine are Romanian 
parliamentarians, met with Igor Smirnov, president of the 
self-proclaimed Dniester Republic. 
  To begin with, Smirnov presented a brief report on the 
socioeconomic conditions in the area, after which he answered 
questions asked by the observers. 
  Among the issues discussed were Dniester citizenship, which, 
I would like to point out, the separatist authorities attempt to 
force on the residents on the left bank of the Dniester River, 
and the use of the Romanian language as a state language; in 
this connection, I have to remind you of the pressure to which 
the three Romanian schools in Dniester are subjected -- in the 
past weeks they have been obliged to return to the Cyrillic 
alphabet. And, of course, the main thing, the Ilascu case. 
  From the international observers we learned that Igor 
Smirnov 
said that Ilascu is, quote, a bandit, unquote, a terrorist about 
whom our state's laws have made a decision and no one may 
interfere or disregard the people's will. He also affirmed that 
due to contradictions between the legislation of the Republic of 
Moldova and that of the so-called Dniester Republic, Ilie 
Ilascu's possible election to the Parliament of the Republic of 
Moldova will not be respected. 
  According to the same sources, Igor Smirnov's attitude 
toward 
the observers representing the CSCE and the Council of Europe 
was one of detachment and indifference. 
  Also today, the same group of observers visited polling 
station No. 1 in Varnita, which is located on the right side of 
the Dniester River, where from 21 February to this afternoon at 
1600 more than 2,000 residents from the other bank, the left 
bank of the Dniester River, had cast their vote.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valery Demidetsky] </F>
  [Text] Chisinau February 27 TASS -- The first-ever 
parliamentary elections on a multi-party basis are being held in 
Moldova today. Twenty independent candidates and 1,022 
candidates from 13 parties and blocs contend for 104 seats in a 
new parliament. 
  Numerous public opinion polls taken on the eve of the 
elections forecast a convincing victory of the Agrarian 
Democratic Party headed by Parliament Speaker Petr Lucinschi. 
  Sociologists' view is that success is also expected to be 
achieved by the Socialist, Social Democratic, and Republican 
Parties, which, like the Agrarians, strive for Moldova's 
independence, a fair solution to the Gagauz and Dniester region 
problems, and for stronger ties with the Commonwealth of 
Independent States. 
  They will be opposed by movements which believe that Moldova 
must unite with Romania. Those movements have a following 
despite the unpopularity of such slogans in Moldova.

  [Text] Chisinau February 27 TASS -- President Mircea Snegur 
on Sunday voted "for political forces which strive for Moldova's 
independence". In an ITAR-TASS interview at a polling station 
here, Snegur voiced hope that "those forces should form a 
parliamentary majority capable of leading Moldova out of the 
crisis and resolving the Gagauz and Dniester problems". 
  "If this does not happen, agonising attempts will again be 
made to get agreement between parties in parliament, between the 
parliament and president", he added. 
  Two thousand polling stations are functioning in Moldova. 
Polling will end at 20:00. The first preliminary results are 
likely to become known late at night. 
  All the 2,900,000 voters of the country got an opportunity 
to 
take part in the polling: on Saturday the Moldovan leadership 
managed to persuade the Gagauz into giving up the earlier 
declared boycott and opening polling stations on their territory. 
  The Dniester authorities refused to open polling stations 
but 
promised not to prevent residents from the left bank of the 
Dniester to cast their votes at special polling stations which 
had opened on the right bank a week ago. 
  The polling is being monitored by 150 observers from Euro 
Council, CSCE, and NATO.

<F P=106> [Mircea Dascaliuc and Anca Florea report from Chisinau] </F>
  [Excerpts] In the course of a discussion I conducted about 
half an hour ago with Mrs. Raisa Botezatu, vice president of the 
Central Electoral Commission, I was given the following 
information: 
  In connection with the data centralization system, Mrs. 
Botezatu told us that from local commissions data are passed on 
to a technical group, which in turn submits them to the Central 
Electoral Commission to be processed with the help of computers. 
Unfortunately, at that time, the Central Electoral Commission 
did not have any information on the number of participants in 
the elections. [passage omitted] 
  Insofar as the east rayons of the Republic of Moldova are 
concerned, up until yesterday 3,910 out of 400,000 possible 
voters had crossed the Dniester River to cast their vote. 
  A total of 2,278,959 citizens were registered in the list 
and 
confirmed; this number, however, does not include the voters in 
the south rayons; nothing was known about them either. So far, 
Raisa Botezatu told us, 163 foreign observers and more than 
5,000 local observers have been accredited. 
  On the other hand, local special envoys and correspondents 
of 
the national radio broadcasting station of the Republic of 
Moldova report that control at the Dniester River crossing in 
both directions was particularly strict this morning. All those 
people who wanted to cross the river were registered. According 
to the same sources, the number of people who wanted to cast 
their vote in the course of the week was much higher than today, 
when local authorities made it difficult to cross the Dniester 
River. 
  We also want to inform you that this morning at 0745 [0545 
GMT], Mircea Snegur, president of the Republic of Moldova, cast 
his vote at the Russian-Polish School. According to the 
national television station, on this occasion he reiterated his 
hopes that the elections will yield a parliamentary majority. 
  Yesterday, a completely unforeseen incident occurred. 
Following yesterday's visit by the international observers, the 
illegal authorities in Tiraspol confiscated the automobile in 
which Romanian Senator Adrian Paunescu was traveling and the 
driver of the automobile was detained. The vehicle is the 
property of Romania's Senate. Diplomatic sources we contacted 
told us that the real reasons for this incident are not known.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS 27/2/1994 -- This morning 
President Mircea Snegur and his wife voted, between the first 
ten electors, at section No. 2 at Russian general school No. 37 
of Chisinau. Asked to comment on his critical attitude towards 
the opposition, expressed yesterday on television, Snegur 
replied: "Critical attitude? Have you understood that the 
critical attitude at yesterday's broadcast was addressed to the 
opposition? Very well." Asked "can there be any free elections 
while Dniester is occupied by the 14th Army," the president said 
"it is a real situation we have at this moment. However, we 
believe that in the Republic of Moldova elections take place for 
the first time on the basis of democracy and pluripartitism. In 
what regards Dniester, the executive took a series of measures 
to allow citizens in this part of the republic take part in the 
voting. Nevertheless, if we would be thinking only of this, I 
mean wait first for the final solution of the Dniester problem 
and only after that run the elections, we would halt other 
urgent measures. It is necessary first of all to have a 
parliament that would contribute to the most urgent solution of 
Dniester's problem." Snegur declared that yesterday's release 
of persons who organized the October rebellion in Moscow "is an 
internal problem of Russians and they will manage without us." 
Inquired if it is significant that he voted in a Russian 
school, President Snegur said "with us, electoral sectors, like 
the lodging place, are not established on ethnic principles. I 
live in the immediate vicinity of this voting section." Asked 
by the BASAPRESS reporter about how will things evolve in case 
there will be no prevailing majority in parliament, Snegur 
estimated that "it is hard to suppose, but I believe a new hard 
process will start, with attempts of conciliation and 
cooperation firstly between parliament factions, then between 
parliament and presidency. It would be good, however, if we had 
a majority faction in parliament." Asked why he voted so early 
and if, in his opinion, enough voters will follow his example, 
Snegur said "elections will run in an organized manner and with 
an active participation of electors, and the fact that I came to 
vote in the very morning is due to my responsibility and because 
my today's agenda includes many questions. On the other hand, 
the most pleasant moment for me is meeting my nephew whom I can 
see only on Sundays."

  [Text] Comrat, BASAPRESS 27/2/1994 -- Some 50 percent of 
40,000 eligible voters in Comrat came to vote this morning at 
the 33 polling centres in this town. Piotr Ivanov, acting 
secretary of the district Executive committee, told BASAPRESS. 
Despite forecasts, there was a high turn-out at all polling 
stations. Ivanov pointed out that the voters did not follow the 
political games of certain local leaders who called on people 
not to participate in the elections. Ender Arat, general consul 
of Turkey in Moldova, arrived in Comrat a day before election 
day. He called on all political forces and movements during a 
meeting with local leaders to be reasonable. Also, Arat 
emphasized the importance of Gagauzians in creating the new 
Moldovan Parliament.

<F P=106> [Anca Florea and Mircea Dascaliuc report from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] On 27 August 1991, the Republic of Moldova 
proclaimed its independence, thus making a first step outside 
the Soviet Union and outside the system to which it belonged 
more than 50 years. 
  On 27 February 1994, the first multiparty elections were 
organized, free elections whose final results will undoubtedly 
exert a tremendous influence on the future of the Republic of 
Moldova. 
  Since last night at 2000 [1800 GMT], when the polling 
stations closed, the Central Electoral Commission has constantly 
been receiving information from the 1,966 electoral commissions 
set up throughout the country. 
  A total of 1,751,278 voters participated in the current 
elections, representing 73.29 percent of the total electorate. 
In the east rayons, of the 400,000 citizens entitled to vote, 
6,829 citizens of both Dniester and Moldovan citizenship cast 
their vote. 
  The Gagauz people participated massively in the elections, 
so 
that in the south rayons, where most of them live, the 
participation rate was 74-98 percent. The lowest participation 
rate was recorded in the four electoral districts in Chisinau 
and the city of Balti -- somewhat higher than 50 percent. 
  The latest data provided by the Central Electoral Commission 
reflect a partial situation based on information gathered up to 
0400 [0200 GMT] from the city of Chisinau and the south of the 
Republic of Moldova. According to this information, the options 
expressed by vote stand as follows: 
  For the Agrarian Democratic Party -- 49.65 percent; 
  For the Bloc of the Socialist Party and Edinstvo Unity 
Movement -- 23 percent; 
  For the Bloc of Peasants and Intellectuals 7 percent; and 
  For the Christian Democratic Popular Front Alliance 7 
percent. 
  These partial results, as Chisinau radio commented, could be 
completed with a general assessment on the situation in the 
south rayons, where the majority of votes will go to the Bloc of 
the Socialist Party and Edinstvo Unity Movement. 
  A summarized review at 0400 [0200 GMT) revealed that the 
electorate is oriented toward just four political formations, 
namely the Agrarian Democratic Party, the Socialist Party and 
Edinstvo Unity Movement, the Christian Democratic Popular Front 
Alliance, and the Bloc of Peasants and Intellectuals. 
  We have to specify that the figures presented here will 
undergo changes, which will be made known to you. 
  And now my colleague will brief you on the final episode of 
the incident in Tiraspol yesterday. 
  The Romanian citizen Ilie Vaduva is outside any danger. Last 
night he was escorted to Chisinau by two diplomats of the 
Romanian Embassy. Our country's ambassador, Mr. Marian Enache, 
told us that he had enjoyed the support of the authorities of 
the Republic of Moldova in solving this case, together with 
whom, he hopes, that he will be able to clarify the problem of 
the automobile of the Romanian Senate that was confiscated in 
Tiraspol. 
  Ilie Vaduva expressed his gratitude to the Romanian Embassy 
in Chisinau, which, through the efforts it made, put an end to 
this unpleasant incident.

  [Text] Chisinau, February 28 TASS -- The early returns of 
the parliamentary elections in Moldova have proved sensational. 
Spot calculation of the ballots has shown that the despite 
forecasts, the coalition of the Socialist Party and 
International Movement Unity, mainly backed by the 
Russian-speaking population, are in the lead in Chisinau, some 
cities and rural districts of the republic. 
  Together with the Agrarian Democratic Party headed by 
parliament speaker Petr Luchinschi, the socialists are ahead of 
all the other parties. 
  Judging by the preliminary results, the opposition in the 
new 
parliament will be made up of pro-Romanian coalition of 
intellectuals and peasants and the Christian Democratic Popular 
Front, which rank third and fourth but will be unable to for a 
majority in new parliament. 
  The above four parties cleared the four-per cent election 
hurdle and won seats in the new parliament. 
  If the forecasts based on the preliminary returns 
materialise, the Agrarian Party will have to team up with the 
socialists to form a majority in the parliament and form a new 
government to lead the republic out of the crisis. If this does 
not happen, "Moldova is in for difficult times", according to 
Petr Luchinschi.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Chisinau, 28 Feb -- The Agrarian Democratic Party 
[ADP], led by Petru Lucinschi, speaker of the Moldovan 
parliament, has won a convincing victory in Moldova's first 
parliamentary elections on a multiparty basis, which ended late 
on Sunday evening. 
  An ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from reliable unofficial 
sources that according to preliminary vote counts, the ADP 
gathered more than 43 percent of votes. In spite of forecasts, 
an unexpected success was achieved by the bloc of the Socialist 
Party and the Yedinstvo Intermovement, relying on the support of 
the Russian-speaking population, which received more than 20 
percent of votes. Like the agrarians, this bloc also supports 
Moldovan independence, a just solution of the Gagauz and 
Dniester problems, and the strengthening of links with the CIS. 
  Judging by the preliminary election results, in the new 
Moldovan parliament their opposition will comprise the Popular 
Christian Democratic Front, supporting unification with Romania, 
which received approximately 7 percent of votes, and the bloc of 
the intelligentsia and peasants, led by Aleksandru Mosanu, 
ex-speaker of the Moldovan parliament, which gathered 
approximately 13 percent of the votes. 
  In the view of observers, these figures indicate that 
nationalistically oriented parties have won a major victory in 
the Moldovan elections. 
  Judging by the preliminary election results, of the 13 
parties and movements that took part in the elections, so far 
only four have managed to pass the 4 percent barrier. 
  The Central Electoral Commission is still summing up the 
final results of the voting. However, in the view of party 
representatives, these are unlikely to differ from the 
preliminary results.

  [Text] Chelyabinsk, 28 Feb -- Chelyabinsk Oblast Prosecutor 
Gennadiy Likhachev has submitted his resignation. Speaking on 
local radio today, he stressed that this step was brought about 
by the fact that he did not agree with the political amnesty 
declared by the State Duma. In his view, "the procuracy has 
once again been made hostage to political intrigues."

  [Text] The General Secretary of the Assembly of Democratic 
Forces of the North Caucasus, Shmidt Dzoblayev, has said that 
the "economic and political situation compels the Russian 
president to impose a state of emergency and save the country 
from fresh political upheavals." 
  In a statement published on Sunday Dzoblayev said that the 
State Duma's resolution on granting amnesty to participants in 
last October's riots poses "an act of absolute disrespect for 
the law, unprecedented in political practice." 
  According to him, as a result of it "the confrontation 
between the various political forces and branches of power will 
inevitably grow, and the consolidation of power institutions 
which began to take shape when the new Constitution was adopted 
will collapse". 
  As Dzoblayev said, Sergey Shakhray must share the 
responsibility for this with the "communist obscurantists". "His 
further being in charge of the ethnic policy department is 
absurd," the statement says.

<F P=106> [Natalya Gorodetskaya report under the "Caucasus" rubric: </F>
"North Ossetia Against Introduction of Federal Rule, and Intends 
To Resolve Ossetia-Ingushetia Conflict Independently"] 
  [Text] Speaking before the republic's mass media 
yesterday, North Ossetia President Akhsarbek Galazov stated that 
the Russian parliament should produce a clear and 
well-considered nationalities policy in the Northern Caucasus. 
Mr. Galazov once again categorically turned down the proposal 
of Vasiliy Tarasenko, chairman of the Federation Council 
committee for federation affairs and regional policy, regarding 
the introduction of a direct federal rule over the entire zone 
of the Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict made upon the return of the 
parliamentary delegation from the Caucasus. 
  North Ossetia assessed this proposal as interference in the 
internal affairs of a sovereign state while, as Akhsarbek 
Galazov said, it drew indignation not only from the republic's 
leaders but also the entire Ossetian people. 
  So categoric a rejection of the parliamentary committee 
head's proposal is quite explainable because once introduced, 
federal rule would make it necessary to act on the Russian 
president's 13 December edict on the return of Ingush refugees 
to North Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon -- something vigorously 
opposed, not without success, by the Ossetians, who first ask 
the Ingush to repent, then demand a moral and political 
assessment of the last year's armed conflict. Also natural is 
the fact that Ingushetia leaders have supported the Russian 
parliamentarians' proposal. 
  The North Ossetia president thinks that the interests of 
both 
sides should be considered in resolving such an acute conflict. 
Forceful interference, even in the form of direct federal rule, 
would only spark a protracted and bloody war between the Ingush 
and the Ossetians. Mr. Galazov said yet one more time that the 
republics would be able to settle the Ingushetia-Ossetia 
conflict independently, gradually, and peacefully, and resolve 
the refugee return problem.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz February 27 TASS -- "The implementation 
of the message by Russian President Boris Yeltsin aiming to 
strengthen power at all levels is designed to speed up economic 
reforms in Russia," North Ossetian President Askharbek Galazov 
told ITAR-TASS upon returning from Moscow. 
  "The most important thing now is to develop a mechanism for 
implementing this message," Galazov stressed. "The president 
counts on the Russian Constitution. Boris Yeltsin has confirmed 
that the state's unity and integrity can be preserved on the 
basis of Russia's federated arrangement," he said. 
  The president shared gave his assessment to the activities 
of 
the parliamentary commission in the state of emergency zone in 
North Ossetia and Ingushetia. The North Ossetian and Ingush 
presidents are capable of settling their differences without any 
mediation, he emphasised. They can solve all complicated issues 
by themselves. "A negotiating process between the two republics 
has got underway, it should be continued," Galazov said. 
  Commenting on the results of the Zheleznovodsk meeting of 
North Caucasian leader with the participation of the chief of 
the Russian president's staff, Galazov described it as "another 
attempt to settle relations between North Ossetia and Ingushetia 
by peaceful means." According to him, "North Ossetia is ready 
to work consistently for establishing normal relations with all 
its neighbours. I insist that the problem of refugees cannot be 
solved by use of force. The final word is to be said by 
reconciliation commissions," he emphasised.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz February 28 TASS -- President Akhsarbek 
Galazov of North Ossetia has reiterated his decision to meet 
Ingush President Ruslan Aushev for discussing problems dealing 
with the settlement of relations between the two republics. 
Speaking today at a meeting with members of the government, the 
presidium of the republican Supreme soviet (parliament) and 
heads of local government bodies, he stressed, however, that the 
meeting should be carefully prepared, and questions to be 
discussed by the two sides should be thoroughly analysed. In 
his opinion, the return of refugees to the populated localities 
of the Prigorodnyy district is the most complicated of them. It 
should be tackled in a comprehensive way on the basis of 
Kislovodsk accords. 
  "The presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia will be able 
to tackle their problems by themselves, without intermediaries, 
to decide matters dealing with the settlement of relations 
between the two nations and to make all the problems clear. The 
negotiating process between the republics has been started, and 
it should be continued," Galazov said. 
  Speaking about the current situation in the part of North 
Ossetia, where a state of emergency will be in effect until 
March 31, Galazov pointed out that it continued to be 
comparatively stable. Russia's peace-making forces in 
cooperation with local law-enforcement agencies are keeping the 
situation under control.

<F P=106> [Viktor Filippov report: "Divorce Nenets-Style. Autonomous </F>
Okrug Intends To Secede from Arkhangelsk Oblast"] 
  [Text] Arkhangelsk -- Nenets Autonomous Okrug has 
scheduled a referendum on secession from Arkhangelsk Oblast for 
20 March. Okrug Governor Yuriy Komarovskiy has officially 
informed Oblast Administration Head Pavel Balakshin of this 
event. 
  The Nenets Autonomous Okrug (capital -- the city of 
Naryan-mar on the Pechora River near its mouth at the Barents 
Sea) was formed 64 years ago. Today it has 55,000 inhabitants 
-- the overwhelming majority of the people are newcomers who 
came to open up the north. Arkhangelsk geologists discovered a 
major oil deposit on the territory of the okrug in the tundra, 
called Ardalinskoye, which is being developed jointly with the 
U.S. firm "Conoco." 
  The Russian Constitution, adopted 12 December last year, 
equated Arkhangelsk Oblast with the Nenets Autonomous Okrug 
within it -- they are now equal components of the Federation. 
Proceeding from this legal base, the okrug leaders have 
prepared a draft edict of the Russian president "On Measures of 
State Support for the Socioeconomic Development of Nenets 
Autonomous Okrug." The key point in this document is the 
okrug's right to export 10 percent of all of the oil extracted 
on its territory. 
  The draft edict, which has acquired the necessary agreement 
by ministries and departments, has already reached the 
president's reception room, but its subsequent progress has been 
stopped in connection with an appeal by Oblast Administration 
Head Pavel Balakshin. 
  "We do not interfere in political, financial, social, or 
administrative decisions by the okrug's leaders," Pavel 
Balakshin said. "But even according to the new Constitution, 
Nenets Okrug is part of Arkhangelsk Oblast as a constituent of a 
single economic area. And our economic ties should not be 
broken if we are really thinking about the good of the people 
living on our territories." 
  However, this dispute about petrodollars has pushed Neneth 
Okrug's leadership toward separatism. Initially, it was only 
elections to the okrug parliament that were scheduled for 20 
March. But now the referendum on the secession of Nenets Okrug 
from Arkhangelsk Oblast has been urgently added.

  [Text] St. Petersburg February 26 TASS -- St. Petersburg 
newspapers reported today at a Friday [25 February] briefing at 
the Federal Counter-intelligence Service's department despite 
all the refutations. The briefing told correspondents about 
details of the detention of five terrorists on the eve of 2 
February near the Kazan cathedral. 
  In the words of head of the service department's division 
against terrorism Aleksandr Kuznetsov, the detained, some of 
whom participated in the October 1993 events in Moscow, prepared 
an armed attack at a Petersburg police station. The attack was 
expected to seize arms to be later used in an attempt upon the 
life of Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak and an attack at the 
Moscow government house. The information is taken from 
materials of the Petersburg counter-intelligence service. 
  According to mass media reports, the individuals were 
detained right after their attack at the sentry-box of the Zarya 
scientific-production amalgamation, where they seized five 
revolvers and 2,000 cartridges. 
  Kuznetsov did not comment on political hidden motives of the 
terrorists' actions in the interests of the investigation. 
However, he said intentions of the group, whose youngest member 
is 39 years old and the oldest is 47, were serious.

  [Text] Moscow, 28 Feb -- The State Duma Council did not see 
that there were any grounds for thinking that, by issuing the 
anmesty resolution, the State Duma had exceeded its powers and 
violated the law and the Constitution. That was the conclusion 
to which the participants of today's session of the chamber's 
council came. 
  The council discussed the situation that had emerged in 
connection with the anmesty decision and the negative reaction 
to it from the president's administration. 
  It is expected that the Duma Council will issue a special 
statement concerning that matter.

  [Text] Moscow, 28 Feb -- The State Duma Council sees no 
grounds for thinking that the State Duma exceeded its powers and 
violated the law and the consitution with its decision on the 
amnesty. That was the conclusion reached by the participants in 
today's session of the chamber's council. 
  The council discussed the situation that has developed over 
the anmesty decision and the negative reaction to it from the 
president's staff. 
  Commenting on the course of the session at the request of 
the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent, Valentin Kovalev, deputy chairman of 
the Duma, said: "Several of the country's political figures have 
spoken in the press about the amnesty and stated that the act 
adopted by the State Duma should be regarded more as a pardon 
than as an amnesty." However, "there are clear legal criteria 
that make it possible to distinguish between these two acts. An 
amnesty is a legislative instrument that is binding for all. A 
pardon is an act that is applied individually and must be 
applied strictly to a specified person. Furthermore, a pardon 
covers only the convicted. An amnesty also covers those under 
investigation, as in this case." 
  "In my view, there are no grounds whatsoever for saying that 
the State Duma exceeded its rights and violated the law and the 
constitution; the Duma Council registered this opinion in the 
record, and there were no objections to this view," Valentin 
Kovalev noted.

  [Text] Moscow February 25 TASS -- "The thoughtless and 
impulsive decision of the State Duma on amnesty may entail the 
most grave consequences for Russia," chairman of the Duma 
Committee on Information Policy and Communications Mikhail 
Poltoranin told an exclusive ITAR-TASS interview here today. 
  The initiators of "political amnesty made a fool" not only 
of 
themselves but also of those they supported; "Both the August 
1991 putsch plotters and participants in the bloody October 
developments should plead guilty in order to become free," said 
Poltoranin. 
  In the opinion of Poltoranin, the opposition worked most for 
the liberation of Aleksandr Rutskoy as a "national leader". But 
the situation will also be used by people who fired at unarmed 
people. 
  The amnesty resolution is an act of humiliation and 
discrediting of the authorities, not only those executive, said 
Poltoranin. "It is a blow on the law-enforcement bodies and the 
legal system of the state," he noted. 
  Intruding into competence of the court bodies, the State 
Duma 
did not think about consequences. The latter may not only occur 
in political life but also affect the interior bodies, which 
fight against crime risking the lives of their staffers. 
  Poltoranin said he is against "global amnesties". In his 
opinion, some 20,000 people will be freed from prisons and 
penitentiaries to make the life of law-abiding citizens even 
more dangerous.

  [Text] Moscow February 25 TASS -- Former Russian Security 
Minister Viktor Barannikov, who was arrested as an organiser of 
the armed opposition revolt last October in Moscow, welcomed the 
amnesty to anti-Yeltsin rebels proclaimed by the State Duma, but 
does not believe himself to be guilty of anything. 
  "I welcome the amnesty if it leads to stabilisation of the 
political situation in the country", Barannikov was quoted as 
saying by his lawyer Dmitriy Matveyenko on Friday. 
  Matveyenko, however, told TASS that the former minister 
understands that an amnesty covers only guilty people and "does 
not consider himself to be such a man". 
  Barannikov is currently staying at home. He was transferred 
from prison to hospital because of heart problems and later 
released on condition that he stays in moscow. 
  The lawyer said his client had been already discharged from 
hospital and his state of health is satisfactory.

  [Text] Former president of the USSR Mikhail Grobachev 
believes that the State Duma's resolution on political amnesty 
was discussed with President Boris Yeltsin beforehand. In an 
interview with Interfax on Friday he noted that the speaker of 
the parliament's lower chamber Ivan Rybkin insisted on taking 
this decision, and, in Gorbachev's opinion, "this decision is 
too serious not to have been discussed with the president 
beforehand." 
  Gorbachev says that the fact that in his speech to the 
Federal Assembly on the following day Yeltsin did not mention 
the subject of amnesty confirms his version. 
  Gorbachev pointed out that he had always favored that the 
coup plotters face a trial, a trial which would be open and 
complete, "otherwise we will not learn the lessons of the August 
1991 events." 
  At the same time, he said, if the State Duma's resolution 
really promotes national accord, he is ready to understand and 
accept that. 
  Gorbachev noted that he is ready to support the decision if 
the State Duma, all political movements of the country and 
Russian society will act jointly for the sake of accord, for the 
rescue of Russia, as it was declared after the adoption of the 
amnesty resolution. 
  "Even though all this concerns me directly, because the 
creation of the State of Emergency Committee inflicted a 
unrepairable damage to the country and to me personally, I put 
the interests of Russia higher," he stressed. 
  However, Gorbachev did not rule out that the State Duma's 
decision would finally lead to further confrontation. (The full 
text of the interview given by M. Gorbachev to Interfax will be 
published in one of the next editions of "Interfax-Exclusive").

  [Text] The Coordinating Council of the "Democratic Russia" 
Movement has called the Duma's amnesty decision "an attempt of 
revenge by communist and fascist extremists." 
  The move threatens all Russia since "it can undermine 
political stability and disturb peace in Russia," says a 
statement released by the movement in Moscow on Saturday. 
  The movement regards the decision as legally misleading 
since 
amnesty as pardon presupposes reference to concrete criminal 
code clauses. However, there are no such references in the 
ruling, which need to be reexamined by the Prosecutor General 
from the angle of its compliance with the law. 
  Those Duma members and factions that voted for the amnesty, 
as democrats believe, cannot expect popular trust today, nor can 
they hope for respect by posterity. "This applies most of all 
to those of them who just recently disguised themselves as 
democrats, above all Sergey Shakhray and Sergey Stankevich, the 
Russian Unity and Concord Party leaders. On February 23, 1994, 
they deserved the name "traitor," the document says. 
  The democrats are convinced that at a time of rampant crime 
and political instability, putting the Duma's amnesty into 
effect "threatens the rights, life, and property of the people 
of Russia and the constitutional system in the country; it will 
untie the hands of both those who once rebelled against the 
legitimate government and of a significant number of criminals."

  [Text] A media briefing took place in Moscow today. 
Anatoliy Borisovich Chubays, chairman of the State Committee 
for Management of State Property, spoke at it. The majority of 
his talk was devoted to the plans for privatization and Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin's message to the Federal Assembly. You 
can hear the second part of Anatoliy Borisovich's news 
conference tomorrow. But now we shall tell you about, we shall 
dwell on, the other no less important and urgent questions which 
Anataoliy Chubays touched upon. 
  [Begin Chubays recording] A few words about the Duma's 
amnesty decision. Overall I must say that this decision of 
course qualitatively alters the situation, in the sense that the 
Duma and its leader, Rybkin, have revealed their true colors, 
and have called a spade a spade. Everything can now be seen in 
its true light. Any illusions which existed before on this 
matter have now been dispelled. Everyone should be clear about 
this. 
  To tell the truth, I am concerned not only about Khasbulatov 
and Rutskoy, personally -- good luck to them. What I am worried 
about is that the decision in the form in which it has been 
adopted, this decision essentially saves actual murderers -- and 
I use these words advisedly -- actual murderers from any 
punishment at all. There is, for example, a certain 
Shtukaturov who, it was established during an investigation, 
personally fired a grenade launcher at Ostankino. Four people 
died as a result of that shot, including one video engineering 
and three cloakroom assistants. 
  Totally innocent people died. Their blood is on the hands of 
the murderers. Since the moment the amnesty decision was made, 
the blood is also on the hands of those who voted for it. 
Zhirinovskiy personally, and Zyuganov personally, have blood on 
their hands and so have their groupings. 
  I would like to ask Zhirinovskiy personally, and Zyuganov 
personally, to go and meet the families of the people who died 
-- if only the families of the cloakroom attendants and the 
video engineer -- and to explain their actions and how they can 
justify their decision. What they will have is not an abstract 
vote in the Duma but a conversation with living people, the 
relatives of those who died at the hands of murderers who will 
be at liberty tomorrow, and who did not use cold steel -- a 
knife or a pistol -- but fired a grenade launcher in the capital 
in broad daylight on a Sunday. This man is to be freed tomorrow 
thanks to the decision of the State Duma. [end recording]

  [Text] The State Duma deputy Vladimir Lysenko, one of the 
leadership of the Yabloko faction, does not believe that there 
will be civil reconciliation in Russia after adoption of the 
memorandum on accord and resolution on amnesty by the State 
Duma. On Saturday in his interview with Interfax he expressed 
opinion that people "who are in Matrosskaya Tishina and 
Lefortovo will start an active political struggle against the 
president, government, and existing regime immediately after 
their liberation." 
  Lysenko qualified the resolution on amnesty, which, as he 
said, was initiated by the leader of the Party of Russian Unity 
and Concord Sergey Shakhray, as "a destabilizing factor." At 
the same time he pointed out that if "an extremist wave is not 
very high after the liberation of the October events 
participants then Shakhray will bypass his major political 
rivals of democratic orientation, Yegor Gaydar and Grigory 
Yavlinskiy." "If the situation sharpens then the consequences 
will be very serious both for Shakhray and for the Party of 
Russian Unity and Concord headed by him. In this case the 
president will dismiss the initiator of this document," he said. 
  Lysenko did not rule out possibility of "preliminary 
contacts" between the State Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin and Boris 
Yeltsin on the issue on amnesty. At the same time he declared 
that "Shakhray was the first in this issue." "I am almost sure 
that first of all Shakhray has coordinated this issue with 
Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin," said Lysenko.

  [Text] Moscow February 26 TASS -- Russian State Duma 
Speaker Ivan Rybkin told ITAR-TASS today they will have to take 
up the amnesty question several times, as the process will last 
for six months and require explanations as need be. 
  Rybkin said they need most interaction with the president, 
the government and the Federation Council. The interaction has 
been discussed with Presidential Assistant Georgiy Satarov. 
There is also need for a memorandum to include a system of 
criteria and a mechanism to ensure national reconciliation, 
civil peace and accord. 
  Speaking of possible consequences of the amnesty, Rybkin 
said 
"street political fighting and gladiators a la Rus are 
inadmissible. If someone tries to do it, one can be sure: the 
State Duma and the president will be able to put them in place." 
  The speaker also reminded that "amnesty as a rule suggests 
toughened punishment for repeated violation". 
  As for persons liable for political amnesty, they are 
expected to "actively join Russian life and the search for 
interaction". Those who do not want to involve in "the common 
cause" should better say at home, said Rybkin.

  [Text] The Russian People's Party led by Telman Gdlyan has 
urged President Boris Yeltsin to ask the Constitutional Court to 
question the legitimacy of the State Duma resolution concerning 
amnesty. 
  In its statement published Saturday evening the party 
qualifies the resolution on granting amnesty to those who 
"instigated and joined" the events of August 19-21, 1991, May 1 
and September 21-October 4, 1993 as "another victory won by the 
anti-reformist forces and disregard for the norms of morality 
and law". According to the document, connivance at these forces 
was what inspired them to stage their revolt in August of 1991, 
which led to frustrating the plans to sign a union treaty, 
breaking up the USSR and exposing the nation to severe 
hardships. "Unfortunately, as a result of political 
near-sightedness, the Russian leadership continued Gorbachev's 
policy of conciliation with the reactionary forces," the 
document states. 
  According to its authors, the State Duma resolution, "which 
is allegedly aimed at reaching conciliation and national 
concord, is in fact an attempt to legitimize lawlessness, 
anarchy and the use of force in political strife". 
  The Russian People's Party expressed concern over the fact 
that the encouragement of those who organized and perpetrated 
"monstrous crimes" may lead to another coup "aimed at curbing 
democratic reforms and unleashing a civil war".

  [Text] A well-known reformist Russian politician has 
described the position of President Boris Yeltsin and his team 
on the recent amnesty issue as one of "amazing inaction." 
  Gavriil Popov, chairman of the Russian Movement for 
Democratic Reforms, addressing a meeting of the movement 
leadership on Saturday, said the president could have 
forestalled the amnesty decision of parliament by putting before 
it his own draft resolution laying down conditions on which 
those involved in last October's conservative revolt could be 
released, one of which could be a ban on any political activity 
for a specified period. 
  Parliament's amnesty resolution could prove to be "either a 
step towards national conciliation or a step towards the 
aggravation of the situation," Popov said. 
  He said the prosecution of the organizers of the 1991 coup 
attempt and of the October 1993 rebellion had proved "the total 
helplessness" of Russia's law enforcement system. The 
Prosecutor General's Office needs "purging from top to bottom," 
he said. 
  At the same meeting, Popov described NATO's plan to carry 
out 
air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs as "the first attempt of 
the West to provide a legal basis for Russia's expulsion from 
the number of great powers." 
  He said the fact that the case of the Ames couple, charged 
with espionage for Russia, was given publicity at a time when 
the Serbs were withdrawing their heavy weapons from around 
Sarajevo looked like "an attempt to discredit in the eyes of the 
Americans the first independent step of Russia." 
  "Surely America could not admit that its policy in 
Yugoslavia 
had fallen through," Popov said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Amnesty: ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI Experts' </F>
Opinion"] 
  [Text] Russian General Prosecutor Aleksey Kazannik must 
apparently have contradictory feelings about having landed in 
the problematic legal situation created by a majority of the 
State Duma deputies who spoke for passing the decree announcing 
political and economic amnesty. 
  First, being general prosecutor, Aleksey Kazannik has no 
right to oversee the legality of a legal act passed by the State 
Duma. Hence his unequivocal statement that the General 
Prosecutor's Office would immediately execute the Duma decree as 
soon as the document is on the general prosecutor's desk. As 
many people know, a package of Duma acts was delivered on the 
evening of 24 February at 15a Pushkinskaya Street, where A. 
Kazannik's agency is located. He, according to General 
Prosecutor's Office officials, is ill at the moment. Will this 
circumstance affect the date for making a decision? 
  Second, there is also no knowing what the general 
prosecutor's reaction would be to the circumstance that a number 
of noted lawyers have serious doubts about the constitutionality 
of some of the provisions of the amnesty decree. Solving such 
differences is the prerogative of the Constitutional Court, but 
it is not functioning at present. 
  What shall be done in this case? How is one to qualify the 
Duma decree in regard to acts of treason? -- precisely this 
article is invoked to charge a number of persons from among the 
organizers of the August 1991 and October 1993 events. Would it 
not be acting against logic and legal norms if the Duma 
amnesties Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and others, and leaves in jail 
those who fall under more merciful articles of the Criminal Code? 
  Finally, one detail of no mean importance is the entering 
into force of the decree as soon as it becomes published. The 
State Duma has no press organ of its own that could be an 
official information source. The Duma is not known to have 
passed any normative act on this score. This means that the 
appearance of Duma decisions on the pages of some newspaper is 
no more than information. 
  Thus, in addition to creating political tensions, the State 
Duma decision also creates a field for confrontation of a legal 
nature. 
  Time will tell whether the legal community is going to have 
an impact on the Duma decision. At any rate, the controversial 
nature of this situation will affect the future of the Lefortovo 
inmates.

  [Text] The former chairman of Russia's parliament, Ruslan 
Khabulatov, has said in an exclusive interview with Interfax's 
correspondent V.Terekhov that he has no intention of engaging in 
political activity. 
  He has "a strong aversion for today's politicians", he 
explained. 
  "I see no genuine politicians in this country; in its 
leadership I see no people with whom an agreement could be 
reached, who would honour their commitments. As compared with 
them Machiavelli is a child. As for me, I attach particular 
importance to moral standards in politics," said the former 
chairman of Russia's parliament. 
  He intends to engage in taking an inventory of his papers, 
Khasbulatov said. 
  "Ironically enough, I concluded two volumes of "World 
Economics and International Economic Relations" by September 
21st," he said. This book exposes "the entire absurdity of 
economic reforms in Russia", he added. 
  Khabulatov believes that, had he not been released from 
Lefortovo under the State Duma resolution, he would have gained 
freedom anyway for a number of reasons. 
  "First of all, for the reason that the investigators failed 
to confirm my guilt, and, secondly, because of my health," he 
noted. 
  The tribulations of the past few months affected his health, 
he said. "I experienced pains in my heart for the first time 
ever, and so I'll have to take care of my health in earnest," he 
said. 
  "During investigations it became clear that I was not 
responsible for the attempts to seize the mayoralty and the TV 
center. I addressed people after that, not knowing about the 
bloody fighting in Ostankino," Khasbulatov said. 
  When asked about the possibility of returning the amnestied 
men to Lefortovo, Khasbulatov said: such an attempt would "only 
emphasize the stupidity of those who may seek to organize this".

<F P=106> [Enrico Franceschini report on interview with Ruslan </F>
Khasbulatov, former Russian parliamentary speaker, granted to 
Franceschini and CORRIERE DELLA SERA's Paolo Valentini in Moscow 
on 27 February: "`There Is a Dictatorship Here; I Will Not 
Return To Politics'"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- Ruslan Khasbulatov lives behind the 
Patriarch's ponds, the place in Moscow where Bulgakov set the 
beginning of his "The Master and Margarita." He lives in a 
modern apartment block constructed in the typical style of the 
homes of the former Soviet nomenklatura -- a fenced garden, 
porter's desk, immaculate entrance lobby, and four elevators. 
It is the same block where I came to interview Leonid 
Brezhnev's grandson some months ago. The former parliamentary 
speaker's apartment seemed even larger and more comfortable than 
that occupied by Brezhnev's grandson -- a labyrinth of rooms, 
mahogany and oak "empire" style furniture, paintings by 
well-known artists on the walls, and soft carpets. The man who 
opened the door for us wore no shoes, only socks. As soon as we 
entered, CORRIERE DELLA SERA's Paolo Valentini and I followed 
suit and removed our shoes, as is usual in Russian homes, in 
order to avoid dirtying the floor with snow and mud. In 
stockinged feet, we followed him to the office where Khasbulatov 
was waiting for us. 
  It was his first morning of freedom. He wore a black shirt, 
blue jeans, and slippers. He held a big cigar, from which he 
drew from time to time. He was pale, rather as he was when we 
interviewed him 4 October with Rutskoy in the White House under 
the gunfire. But of course he was in a much better mood. He 
got up from a divan covered with a large bearskin, on which we 
then sat. He shook hands with us and said: "I wanted to meet 
with you out of politeness, out of respect for what you did that 
day." He was referring to the appeal that he issued through us 
for the Western countries to intervene vis-a-vis the Kremlin to 
save his life and the lives of others, if they surrendered. 
"But the Russian newspapers printed a lot of nonsense, as 
though Rutskoy and I had sought help only in order to escape who 
knows where." We told him how we conveyed their appeal to the 
Italian diplomatic service and how it reached the EC foreign 
ministers at their meeting in Brussels. 
  "This is the first time I have heard about it. The Russian 
press misled our people. Be that as it may, we came out of 
parliament alive 4 October not thanks to the help of the 
European governments but because the commandos of the Alfa and 
Vympel group sent by Yeltsin to kill us all refused to obey 
orders. As you know, Alfa and Vympel were dissolved, destroyed 
as a punishment, a few days ago. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Will you tell us how exactly your arrest 
took 
place? 
  [Khasbulatov] Two young commanders reached us. We had moved 
to the room next to that in which we received you for the 
interview a little earlier, because shots were still reaching 
that one. They said: "Our group has met and decided not to 
carry out the order to arrest you and to execute you, Ruslan 
Imranovich [Khasbulatov], Aleksandr Vladimirovich [Rutskoy], 
whom we greatly respect, and all the others here. We are 
officers, we have a heart, we reason with our own brains, we 
love our homeland, and we know that you are defending a just 
cause -- the constitution. If you trust us, follow us, leave 
here with us, and we will protect you from those people. We will 
guarantee your safety, even if they attack us." We did trust 
them, and all went well. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] How do you feel now, after five months in 
prison? 
  [Khasbulatov] After 144 days, to be exact. Well, the air of 
freedom is always better, it is a great help. Now I want to 
finish writing my book on economics, then I will think about a 
book about what happened in October. The book about the 1991 
coup has been translated in several countries, including Italy. 
I would like a publisher who pays well... 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] You do not intend to be just a writer, do 
you? 
  [Khasbulatov] I must think about it. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Don't you want to return to politics? 
  [Khasbulatov] In the past three years it has become 
difficult 
to find political interlocutors who are really worthy from the 
viewpoint of integrity. Those with whom I have had dealings 
behaved like petty criminals, always prepared to break their 
word. Petty tricksters who adopt the guise of great 
politicians. They disgust me. I do not know when a new 
leadership class will emerge. Be that as it may, I am an 
economics teacher, a respected and well-known academic. I will 
write books, return to my students. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you think that Russian democracy is in 
danger? 
  [Khasbulatov] Unfortunately democracy in Russia has taken a 
great step backward. Until 21 September (the day Yeltsin 
dissolved parliament -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) there was a 
democratic system, a democratic constitution, better chances of 
emerging from the economic crisis. Now there is an 
authoritarian system. Ask the Western leaders whether they are 
pleased with the result. I would like you to convey my question 
to Mr. Kohl, Mr. Major, Mr. Mitterrand, Mr. Clinton: Are they 
pleased with what they have done to Russia? They have helped 
Yeltsin to become a dictator with no limits or controls, they 
have driven the country to the brink of destruction. For our 
people there is no longer any democracy or freedom: Are people 
in the West happy about this? 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Yeltsin and the government are espousing 
many 
of your positions in economic policy, in foreign policy... 
  [Khasbulatov] All they can do is repeat my words. They 
cannot act. At least they have realized something, despite 
their lack of intelligence: They have realized that parliament 
and I were right. Now they are saying what the people want to 
hear, but I have my doubts about whether they are capable of 
acting. If they do something, they do so clumsily, 
unprofessionally. This irritates both the Russian people and 
the world community. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] What is your opinion of this Duma, the new 
parliament? 
  [Khasbulatov] It is too early to issue a final assessment. 
After all, it has only been working for little over a month. 
For the present, I am grateful to the deputies who, by 
approving the amnesty, respected the voters' wishes: None of 
them could have been elected if he had not pledged to struggle 
to restore some justice. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Was the amnesty a surprise for you? 
  [Khasbulatov] No, because I know the Russian people and 
their 
ability to bring pressure to bear. We owe our freedom entirely 
to the people. There has been talk about my release for weeks 
now. In any case there was no evidence; all their attempts to 
fabricate it were in vain. Their story no longer stood up. 
They were obliged to release me and Rutskoy. Parliament and I 
did not take a single illegitimate step, but they wanted to 
blame us for certain mistakes, the street incidents, and the 
actions of the armed gangs, which acted autonomously. I never 
ordered the television station to be attacked. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Did you consult with Rutskoy before deciding 
whether to accept the amnesty? 
  [Khasbulatov] No, we were always totally isolated in prison. 
But I would remind you that to accept an amnesty does not entail 
acknowledging your guilt. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Were you ever hit or maltreated from the day 
of your arrest until your release? 
  [Khasbulatov] Never. Everyone always treated me with 
respect. I will tell you a story in this regard. It was the 
commandos of the Alfa group that brought us to prison in a bus. 
Perhaps somebody did think that I was public enemy number one, 
because Kortsakov, the head of Yeltsin's personal bodyguard, was 
in the bus too, and there were two armored cars behind. The 
young commandos were forbidden to speak, so as they entered the 
bus, one by one, each of them placed a hand on my arm and 
squeezed it as a sign of solidarity. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] How did you spend your time in prison? 
  [Khasbulatov] I had a lot of time to reflect. I read a great 
deal. Books on philosophy. And novels -- all of Dreyser's, 
Sue's "The Mysteries of Paris," and Prosper Merimee. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Were you never depressed? 
  [Khasbulatov] Never. In my heart I always believed that this 
is how things would turn out. I never lost hope. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Did you speak with Rutskoy Saturday evening 
[26 February], after your release? 
  [Khasbulatov] I phoned him at home but he was already 
asleep. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] What time did you go to bed? 
  [Khasbulatov] At 0500 this morning. My desk was covered in 
mail and documents. I spent the night sorting them out. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Did your wife experience any problems during 
this period? 
  [Khasbulatov] She received telephone calls telling her that 
she had to leave this apartment. It is said that Yeltsin has 
created a new system. It is not true: He uses the same 
communist methods from before. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] You used to be great friends with Boris 
Yeltsin. How did you become arch enemies? 
  [Khasbulatov] I would not say that we were great friends. It 
would take a book to answer your question. We will talk about 
it again next time. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] But if you could say something about Yeltsin 
now... 
  [Khasbulatov] I will not say anything. As far as I am 
concerned, he no longer exists. I regard him neither as a 
political leader nor as president; this man no longer exists; he 
is neither dead nor alive. As far as I am concerned, he is 
finished. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you think that Russia shares your opinion 
and that Yeltsin will not remain in power long? 
  [Khasbulatov] Yes, I am absolutely sure. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Ruslan Imranovich, pardon me for asking: Why 
do you always wear a black shirt? Were you wearing one when you 
were arrested? 
  [Khasbulatov] No. In parliament I wore a white shirt. But 
after two weeks of being without water and unable to wash, it 
became black. This one really is black, though. I put it on 
precisely in order to recall 4 October.

  [Text] The leader of the National Salvation Front and 
former MP, Ilya Konstantinov, has said that "the former inmates 
of Lefortovo, as well as most political forces in the country 
and State Duma deputies, are not interested in bringing 
political strife in Russia beyond legitimacy; they intend to 
work to stabilize the political situation". 
  An active participant in last May's and last October's riots 
in Moscow, Konstantinov left the Lefortovo prison as a result of 
the amnesty proclaimed by the State Duma on February 23rd. 
  According to Konstantinov, the amnesty granted to "those who 
defended the Supreme Soviet and the Constitution is first of all 
an act of justice", since "the people charged together with him 
are not to blame for anything". 
  Konstantinov described the attempts to link the amnesty with 
the start of another spiral of civil war in Russia as "political 
provocation". According to him, in Russian society there are 
forces interested in "inciting political hysteria" with a view 
to using the resulting situation as a means of pressure on the 
State Duma and on the opposition. 
  When asked about his short-term plans, Konstantinov said 
that 
he intends to "have a rest and get his bearings".

  [Text] At 17:15 Ilya Konstantinov, leader of National 
Salvation Front, left the investigation prison Lefortovo. A 
crowd which has gathered at the prison's gates actually embraced 
him. Saying "Thank you, thank you," Konstantinov came up to 
his car with great difficulties and moved away. 
  When asked by journalists who will become Russia's next 
president, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy who was staying near Lefortovo answered 
that the people would make their choice. In Zhirinovskiy's 
words, the people will have to choose either him or Rutskoy. 
  Leader of the Labor Russia and Russian Communist Labor Party 
Viktor Anpilov left Lefortovo at 17:25, just after Konstantinov. 
Hundreds of his supporters welcomed Anpilov. 
  At an improvised meeting Anpilov declared: "The will of the 
single Soviet people has torn us from the torture-chambers. We 
have not recognized our guilt and do not recognize it. There is 
no guilt. We have chosen amnesty for the sake of accord and 
reconciliation in the society." 
  "If I leave the prison and see that prices have dropped and 
people live better then Yeltsin was right. If prices raised and 
people live worse then I shall continue my struggle till the 
victory," declared Anpilov. 
  Accompanied by a 400-strong crowd of his supporters Anpilov 
left the square before the investigation prison on foot. 
  In his interview with Interfax Anpilov said that now his 
nearest task is "to organize working staffs for struggle with 
the regime." He intends "to travel throughout the country and to 
meet with working people." 
  Anpilov believes that now Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin has 
occupied that place on the political arena which earlier was 
occupied by Ruslan Khasbulatov. 
  According to Anpilov, it is necessary to hold early 
presidential elections because there is a new Constitution and a 
new president should swear on the new Constitution.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS observer] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 28 Feb -- The office of the Russian 
Federation Procurator General "was forced to take steps 
immediately to release those amnestied" after the State Duma's 
resolution on the amnesty was published and thus was entered 
into force. Deputy Procurator General Vladimir Kravtsev said 
this in an exclusive interview with an ITAR-TASS observer. In 
this context, he denied allegations that he had acted with undue 
haste with respect to the inmates at the remand center at 
Lefortovo prison and described such statements as "attempts of 
the president's entourage to shift all the blame for the 
implementation of the amnesty resolution, which had come into 
force, onto the bodies of the procuracy." Incidentally, 
Procurator General Aleksey Kazannik explained his decision to 
resign by the fact that "a prosecutor in Russia does not have 
the authority to suspend an act of amnesty. Neither does he 
have the right of legislative initiative, so he could not 
request the State Duma to reconsider its own resolution." 
  According to Vladimir Kravtsov, at 1100 on 26 February 
"Procurator General Kazannik signed an official request to the 
State Duma to clarify a number of questions which were unclear 
to us as executors of this law. That evening we received an 
official response signed by two chairmen of Duma committees, 
Vladimir Isakov and Ilyukhin," to the effect that there was no 
need whatsoever "to make special additional clarifications of 
the procedure of the execution of the State Duma resolution on 
the political and the economic amnesty." 
  Vladimir Kravtsev also described some details of the release 
of the inmates from the remand center at Lefortovo prison. On 
that day, he asserts, "the prosecutor's office, with no rush at 
all, acquainted all eligible inmates with the full text of the 
resolution and learned their opinion, as required by Article 5 
Point 4 and by the note at the end of this article, whether they 
agree that this act of amnesty be applied to them personally." 
  "They all agreed, though not unequivocally," Vladimir 
Kravtsev said. Thus, Ruslan Khasbulatov wrote that "I have not 
and am not pleading guilty" but, in view of the direction and 
the essence of the State Duma resolution, "I agree that this act 
of amnesty should be applied to me." Other expressed similar 
views. Altogether, throughout the day on 26 February the 
General Procurator's office sanctioned the release of 16 of 
those accused in organizing the tragic October events in Moscow, 
Kravtsev said. He also acknowledged that he had personally 
signed all the instructions of the prosecutor's office on the 
release. 
  "I would like say on my own behalf" that now "the 
president's 
team is simply looking for someone to blame," Vladimir Kravtsev 
stressed. He went on to say that the resignation statement of 
Aleksey Kazannik, made on Saturday, is "his personal decision. 
He did not urge us (deputies-Eds) to join him and so on." 
However, "should such methods of putting pressure on the 
prosecutor's office, among others, continue, it is our duty and 
responsibility to resign," Kravtsev said. He also stated, on 
the instruction of his colleagues, that deputies of Procurator 
General Aleksey Kazannik would not resign before the Federation 
Council had made a decision over the dismissal of Aleskey 
Kazannik. They had jointly made this decision after internal 
consultations on 27 February. Vladimir Kravtsev did not 
preclude the possibility of "the Federation Council not 
accepting the resignation of Aleksey Kazannik" but added to 
this: "I am almost convinced that it will be accepted and

  [Text] Moscow, 26 Feb (ITAR-TASS) -- Vyacheslav Kostikov, 
the press secretary of the Russian president described the 
release of organizers and participants of the events in October 
1993 from Lefortovo as a blasphemous action. He said today that 
people whose hands and conscience have been party to bloodshed, 
people who were ready to push Russia into the bloody maelstrom 
of the civil war have been released without trial. 
  The press secretary of the Russian president believes that 
the State Duma and in the first place those parties who 
initiated and supported this blasphemous action are wholly 
responsible for this act of moral violence. This is the first 
time in the history of world parliamentarism. He believes that 
the State Duma is becoming the coparticipant of unlawfulness. 
  Having abused the people's trust, the deputies have for the 
the first time in history -- the statement he has issued says -- 
taken the side of evil-doers against the state. The State Duma, 
which was called upon to be the guardian of law, the initiator 
of civil accord, and a participant in building a rule-of-law 
state, has by its own will removed from the framework of justice 
persons accused of the gravest of state crimes, preferring hasty 
political demarches to a just court. 
  The document points out that an outrage has been committed 
against justice, public opinion has been rejected, and the 
opinion of a president elected by popular vote has been 
challenged. The haste and urgency with which the State Duma 
strove to achieve the immediate implementation of its 
resolution, and in essence the covering up of the evil done to 
Russia, is evidence not of the Duma's desire to achieve civil 
peace and accord, but of its effective incitement to political 
extremism. 
  In the unlawful situation that has come about, the president 
of Russia reserves the right to act in accordance with the 
powers granted to him by the Constitution, Kostikov declared.

  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Announcer] The State Duma has 
decided on a political amnesty. The resolution was published on 
25 February, and on the 26th, Aleksandr Rutskoy, Ruslan 
Khasbulatov, Albert Makashov, Viktor Anpilov, Ilya Konstantinov 
and others emerged from detention. [passage omitted] 
  Yegor Gaydar, of Russia's Choice, was one of the few who 
voted against the political amnesty. 
  [Begin Gaydar recording] I am absolutely convinced, no 
shadow 
of doubt, that this decision is a step towards destabilizing the 
situation in Russia. I am absolutely convinced that the people 
just released from prison will in the coming months take charge 
again of forming armed gangs who will hit the Moscow streets. I 
am absolutely convinced that their conduct will lead to 
bloodshed. I would like Russia to recognize who are its heroes, 
and who is leading it along this path. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Now the opinion of those whom we approached for 
their comments. Mikhail Gorbachev is the ex-president of the 
former USSR, the former general secretary of the former CPSU, 
and a witness in the SCSE case. 
  [Begin Gorbachev recording] (?Regarding this decision), I 
feel that the State Duma is of course entitled to make it. That 
is its prerogative, as in the Constitution. So everything is 
clear from the legal standpoint. 
  Secondly, an amnesty is not an acquittal. It is clemency. 
This has to be kept in mind. The main aspect of it is that if 
three-fourths of the deputies equate Russia's current situation 
to one of grave crisis and conclude on the need to abandon all 
that drives us apart, if in this situation such a majority 
decision is reached by deputies, then I am ready to agree with 
them. 
  So in the given situation, I would say this: I agree with 
the decision as understood in my first point. Recriminations 
must not be allowed onto the scene. This is a signal, the 
alarm, that we have to abandon secondary considerations. Given 
that, I am in favor of the State Duma's decision. But if it is a 
move back to the previous strife, recriminations and tension in 
the country, then I condemn those who want to use the State Duma 
in this way to provoke civil conflict. [end recording] [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Moscow, 27 Feb -- The release of those responsible 
for the October bloodshed in Moscow who have been given an 
amnesty by the State Duma will only assist their return to 
active politics. This opinion was set out in an interview 
Mikhail Poltoranin, member of the "Russia's Choice" faction of 
deputies and chairman of the Committee for Information Policy in 
the State Duma, gave to an ITAR-TASS correspondent. In his 
view, following the release of the "Lefortovo" inmates, "the 
president must not slacken his grip on the reins of power, 
otherwise the carriage of Russian statehood could go off the 
rails." 
  For his part, the former KGB head, Vadim Bakatin, speaking 
from political and professional experience, forecasts that "in 
the present circumstances many of the Lefortovo inmates will 
rush to whip up the crowd to act against the president." If 
events turn out that way, he suggests, the force of the law will 
have to be applied at once to political adventurists.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 27 Feb -- "The release of Rutskoy will alter 
the configuration of candidates at the coming presidential 
elections, and will especially weaken Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's 
position," deputy of the State Duma, Minister for Affairs of 
Nationalities and Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray said in an 
interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent today. He voiced the 
hope that those released from Lefortovo "will wage the political 
struggle in civilized forms." 
  "There is in me, as in anyone else, an element of alarm in 
connection with the political statements of the inmates of 
Lefortovo released yesterday," Sergey Shakhray added. "The 
political organizations which achieved only a political amnesty, 
should take upon themselves responsibility for the actions of 
the released leaders. If the latter plan to continue the 
struggle in the elections like other citizens of the Russian 
Federation, that is a normal phenomenon, but if they are 
planning to fight in order with the help of slogans to seize, 
destroy, or gun down -- that means fresh criminal cases will be 
instituted and there will be no consensus or reconciliation." 
  But Deputy Konstantin Zatulin in an interview to ITAR-TASS 
expressed the opinion that any political statements by Ruslan 
Khasbulatov and Viktor Anpilov on leaving Lefortovo are "quite 
natural." The most important thing was whether these statements 
would be followed by any political actions. Konstantin Zatulin 
considers it expedient to "discuss in the Duma the question of a 
possible ban on political activity by active participants in the 
October events of 1993." 
  We remind you that after coming out of Lefortovo Viktor 
Anpilov spoke today on Moscow's Theater Square, calling on 
several hundred activists of "Working Moscow" and the Russian 
Communist Workers' Party to set up a workers' party. 
  In an interview to REUTER's agency Aleksandr Rutskoy's aide 
Andrey Fedorov stated that his boss "will not stay out of 
politics because he has never given up the idea of becoming 
president. He has come out of prison in a fighting mood." 
  As for Ruslan Khasbulatov, he told journalists that he was 
leaving politics and intends shortly to visit his relatives in 
Chechnya.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 28 Feb -- Assessing the degree of risk from 
the release of the Lefortovo prisoners, presidential aide 
Georgiy Satarov noted at today's Kremlin briefing that there are 
two ways to ensure that destabilizing developments are averted. 
First, according to Satarov, "the president of Russia is 
inclined to minimize the potential harm inflicted by the 
political amnesty decision." With this aim in mind Boris 
Yeltsin will, in the near future, possibly today, address the 
citizens of the country in defense of human rights and with an 
assessment of the act of political amnesty. 
  Second, Georgiy Satarov remarked, State Duma chairman Ivan 
Rybkin and the deputies have recognized that they have "become 
the hostages of their own decision and of the future behavior of 
those whom they have set free." Therefore, the president's aide 
thinks, "whether from considerations of self-preservation or 
arising out of a wish for accord and reconciliation" the 
deputies will try not to allow a new round of extremism in 
society. 
  Another participant in the briefing -- Aleksandr Yakovlev, 
the president's plenipotentiary representative in the Federal 
Assembly -- voiced a warning in connection with the fact that 1 
May 1994 might repeat the "fresh and painful experience of last 
year's May Day." The lawyer reminded his listeners that the law 
does not provide for a second act of amnesty in relation to one 
and the same group of persons. 
  Unlike his colleagues in the presidential administration, 
Yuriy Baturin, the president's national security aide, sees from 
his viewpoint the greatest danger for society as being in the 
split among the democrats. He pointed out that there is now a 
strategy for uniting democratic forces, laid down in the 
president's message. 
  Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent on how 
Boris Yeltsin reacted to the two aides' efforts to suspend the 
political amnesty, Georgiy Satarov answered: "We have not been 
asked to resign. His reaction was a balanced one." 
  Although the members of the the presidential apparatus 
intended to devote the briefing to the president's message, 
journalists changed the theme of the meeting with questions 
like: "How was it that the situation with the political amnesty 
caught you unawares?" 
  In their answers Aleksandr Yakovlev, Georgiy Satarov, and 
Yuriy Baturin repeated their already well-known arguments on the 
imperfect nature of the legislation, the dual position of the 
procuracy, and the need to observe the law.

  [Text] The Russian president's press service will start 
holding regular briefings from today. Boris Yeltsin's press 
secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov and presidential aide Georgiy 
Satarov discussed a very topical and timely subject with 
journalists today -- the defense of democracy and human rights. 
  As ITAR-TASS has just reported, Georgiy Satarov, the head of 
state's aide, told the briefing that Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin has prepared certain actions aimed at defending the 
democratic state and society. He refused to specify the form in 
which these measures would be carried out. However, Yuriy 
Baturin, the president's assistant for national security, added 
that these steps might even be taken today. He described press 
speculation that this would include a TV address as being close 
to the truth.

  [Text] Moscow, 26 Feb -- Aleksey Kazannik, the Russian 
prosecutor general, announced his resignation today. The 
statement by the prosecutor general, made public at a news 
conference held at the prosecutor's office, says: 
  "The Russian Federation president has appealed to me to 
suspend the amnesty process ordered by the resolution dated 23 
February of the Federal Assembly State Duma, entitled `On 
Declaring Amnesty for Political and Economic Prisoners.' I 
fully agree with the civic attitude and the content of this 
appeal by the head of state. 
  "Many dozens of people were killed and over 1,000 were 
crippled in the May and October disturbances. There are widows, 
orphaned children, and sorrowing parents. Enormous material 
damage has been caused. However, the State Duma is forgiving 
all those people who are guilty of this. In accordance with its 
will, unrepentant organizers of mass disturbances, their 
instigators and perpetrators will be set free. Among them there 
are many people whose conscience is burdened with killings, 
pogroms, and robberies. The act of `political' amnesty, as the 
legislators have called it, will forever remain a black page in 
the history of Russian parliamentarism. 
  "Despite this, as the Russian Federation prosecutor general, 
I have to think not only of the spirit but also of the letter of 
the law when I make a decision. The prosecutor in Russia does 
not have the authority to suspend an amnesty act. Nor does he 
have a right to legislative initiative enabling him to appeal to 
the State Duma for the resolution to be reconsidered. Therefore 
I have no choice: I resign as Russia's prosecutor general. 
  "I am little concerned about my future. I have always felt 
strongly about Russia and its longsuffering people. I believe a 
golden age will come when truth will be called truth, a lie will 
be called a lie, virtue will be called virtue, and lawlessness 
will be called lawlessness. But it will come through the 
efforts of neither the patriot-communists, nor the supporters of 
Zhirinovskiy, nor yet through those of democrats who have 
debased their noble status as members of the Russian 
intelligentsia."

  [Text] I have just received an INTERFAX report in the 
studio. It says that Boris Yeltsin has accepted the resignation 
of Procurator General Aleksey Kazannikov. 
  This is followed by a report from the presidential press 
service which says that the edict also decrees that Aleksey 
Nikolayevich Ilyushenko be presented to the Federation Council 
as a candidate for nomination to the post of procurator general 
of the Russian Federation. 
  Until the procurator general is appointed, Ilyushenko is 
entrusted with carrying out his duties. 
  Under another edict, Ilyushenko is released from the post of 
head of the control directorate of the president's 
administration.

  [Text] Moscow, February 28 (TASS) -- "I have acted in full 
compliance with law and my conscience is clear. Let those who 
do not rely on law blush for their conduct," said Alexey 
Kazannik, former Russian prosecutor general, as he parted with 
his colleagues on Monday. Kazannik's resignation was accepted 
by Russian president on February 26. 
  Addressing his colleagues, Kazannik explained his 
resignation, saying that he had been put under pressure from 
high-ranking officials from the president's administration who 
demanded that the resolution on amnesty adopted by the State 
Duma be suspended. "As a supporter and authorised official of 
President Yeltsin, I had to carry out any presidential orders, 
even of they were illegal," Kazannik said. 
  On the other hand, Kazannik referred to officials of the 
prosecutor's office who believe that "there are no legal grounds 
to do anything against this amnesty." Facing a complex dilemma, 
Kazannik tried to "personally get in touch with the Russian 
president and explain the situation to him." However, he failed 
to do this and decided to resign from his post. 
  Kazannik declared that Aleksey Ilushenko, temporarily 
appointed to the post of the prosecutor general by the Russian 
president, as a chairman of the control department of the 
president's administration, had called on him to prevent putting 
the resolution an amnesty into effect. This "illegal" demand, 
as Kazannik put it, was made by participants in an emergency 
meeting held to discuss the only one problem -- how to prevent 
the amnesty and who adopted a decision not to let prisoners out 
of Lefortovo whatever the cost might be.

  [Text] Moscow February 27 TASS -- Vladimir Shumeyko, 
chairman of the Federation Council, has consented to the 
president's proposal to appoint Aleksey Ilyushenko as acting 
prosecutor-general of the Russian Federation. 
  It has become known from reliable sources that the decision 
was taken "on the basis of the president's recommendation 
pending the consideration of an item to this effect at a 
Federation Council meeting in accordance with Article 102 of the 
Russian Constitution". 
  The need to appoint an acting prosecutor-general arose in 
view of the resignation of Aleksey Kazannik from the post on 
Saturday. 
  Kazannik disagrees with the release, by a State Duma 
decision, of those guilty of the October 3-4, 1993, bloodshed in 
Moscow, and regards it as unlawful and uncoordinated with law 
enforcement agencies.

  [Text] Moscow February 27 TASS -- "The strange stand of the 
Russian procurator general's office provokes bewilderment," 
presidential assistants Yuriy Baturin and Georgiy Satarov told 
ITAR-TASS on Saturday. 
  "The Russian procurator general sent a letter to the State 
Duma on Saturday morning to specify circumstances preventing the 
procurator's office from the implementation of the Duma 
resolution on political amnesty. Two Duma committees started to 
prepare a response to the procurator's inquiry believing that 
the procurator general's office waits for the answer," they said. 
  Meanwhile the committees did their work, the procurator 
general's office implemented the resolution to free culprits of 
the October 1993 bloodshed, which runs counter to the law, 
judging by Kazannik's letter. 
  The resolution on liberation of the accused was signed by 
Deputy Procurator General Kartsev "on silent consent of the 
procurator general, stressed presidential assistant on national 
security and doctor of juridical sciences Baturin. As a result, 
the procurator general's office created a precedent of illegal 
implementation of decisions, he said. 
  In his turn, Satarov said the procurator general's office 
adopted a resolution to free the Lefortovo inmates while the 
Duma tried to remove contradictions in its resolution on 
political amnesty.

<F P=106> [Pavel Koltsov report under the "Moscow Rumors" rubric: </F>
"Spies Will No Longer Be `Journalists'? Things Seem To Be 
Moving That Way"] 
  [Text] It has transpired that Yevgeniy Primakov, director 
of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) has ordered that 
the financing of foreign offices of a number of Russian 
publications used by FIS officers as journalistic cover be 
stopped. 
  Inside the FIS, however, they see nothing sensational about 
this. Yevgeniy Primakov arrived at the conclusion as early as 
two years ago that the Russian intelligence service had more 
than enough journalist "cover." Chiefs of many Russian mass 
media had long been convinced of that. Thus a decision has been 
made to phase out journalist cover until none remains. In the 
United States, for example, there has long been an act 
prohibiting intelligence officers from working under the guise 
of journalists. 
  In all fairness, far from all professional Russian spies 
subscribe to their superiors' decision. "While journalist 
status is not diplomatic immunity, of course, it is still a 
useful thing," one of them argued.

appointed Sergey Tsiplyayev his plenipotentiary representative 
at the Interparliamentary Assembly of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States. 
  Yeltsin's decree notes that the appointment was prompted by 
the need for maintaining permanent relations between the Russian 
president and the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS states. 
  ITAR-TASS learnt at the presidential press service on Friday 
that Tsiplyayev, the president's representative in St. 
Petersburg, will perform his new duties concurrently.

  [Text] The Russian president has accepted the resignation 
of Social Protection Minister Ella Pamfilova. 
  Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's press secretary, told 
INTERFAX that Yeltsin had listened to Ella Pamfilova's reasons 
for resigning and found them convincing. 
  But Boris Nikolayevich voiced the hope that Pamfilova would 
not abandon the social sphere and would continue to tackle the 
problem as a deputy in the State Duma. 
  Ella Pamfilova has already, as INTERFAX recalls, tendered 
her 
resignation twice this year, following the the departure from 
the government of Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov.

  [Text] Moscow February 26 TASS -- The first and second TV 
and radio channels must be state, chairman of the State Duma 
committee for Information Policy and Communications Mikhail 
Poltoranin told ITAR-TASS here today. 
  "One should only welcome special attention of the president 
given to the issue in his message to the Federal Assembly. But 
I would not hurry to rejoice as there may be forces to urge the 
president on unjustified decisions," he said. 
  In the words of Poltoranin, he "repulsed the attacks of 
forces wishing to divide the material-technical basis of mass 
media and break the single information space for the past two 
years." 
  His parliamentary committee receives inquiries of deputies 
who are alarmed with the attempts to divide the influence 
spheres in mass media bodies. "The president said that TV and 
radio channels are not liable for privatization and shall be 
state, but one cannot say for sure whether they will remain 
state in future," added Poltoranin. 
  In his words, the parliamentary committee aims to create 
conditions for economic independence of mass media, which "is 
the only guarantee of observation of constitutional rights in 
Russia at a time of anarchy." "If mass media fails to get the 
economic basis for its independence it will be suppressed and 
this process has begun. The president shall say the word in 
order not to allow this to happen," said the committee chairman.

  [Text] The First Congress of Russia's Unity and Concord 
Party [PRES] opened in Moscow on Saturday. Taking part are 220 
delegates from 66 regions of Russia. 
  They intend to discuss the draft of a party program and the 
results of the elections to the Federal Assembly, amend the 
rules and elect the steering bodies, and work out the party's 
strategy and tactics for local elections. 
  In his speech on the party program, its leader Sergey 
Shakhray declared that his party is "a national conservative 
organization, respecting such traditional values as state, 
family, property, and morality." In his words, the party aims 
at keeping Russia as a state by recognizing the economic, 
political, and cultural diversity of its regions. 
  Shakhray proposed endorsing only "the framework of the 
program" at this stage and to finalize it at the 2d Congress, 
planned for the spring this year. Before that the program could 
be explained in the party's regional branches. 
  As a delegate has revealed to Interfax, the money for the 
forum have come "from the party fund and from the commercial 
structures, sharing the party's goals and tasks."

  [Text] Moscow February 27 TASS -- The Party of Russian 
Unity and Accord [PRES] led by Sergey Shakhray proclaimed itself 
"an all-Russia provincial conservative party". This idea took 
shape during the party's first congress which ended its work in 
Moscow on Sunday. The congress drew party representatives from 
Russia's 64 regions. 
  "We understand conservatism as something resting upon 
spirituality, morals, family", Shakhray told a news conference 
after the congress. He said "the Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord aims to restore upset ties with the tsarist Russia 
without totally repudiating the Soviet times". He told 
reporters the party did not yet have any programme, it "is 
expected to be adopted at the party's second congress this 
coming autumn". Participants in the first congress took a 
decision to publish a party newspaper. 
  Among his potential allies, Shakhray listed the Yabloko 
(Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin) Bloc, entrepreneurs' movement, as 
well as organizations of social democratic orientation, while 
the party's main opponents are Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic 
Party and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. The 
party leader did not rule out the possibility of tactical 
coordination of activities with the Russia's Choice bloc. 
However, he stressed that "we cannot regard them as our allies".

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "First Responses to the President's </F>
Message"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The Russian Federation 
president's message to the Federal Assembly "contains a 
sufficiently powerful potential charge for the main areas of 
domestic and foreign policy -- which represent the president's 
constitutional duty -- to be carried out by him now," Aleksandr 
Yakovlev, the president's representative in parliament, stated. 
  As is noted in the president's message, laws establishing 
clear rules pertaining to the functioning of state organs and, 
above all, the organs of executive power should be drafted and 
adopted in the very near future. They should provide effective 
mechanisms of control and accountability which make it possible 
to adopt legal acts which can actually be carried out, that is 
to say, do not allow arbitrary interpretation, and which are 
economically sound and include specific sanctions for their 
nonfulfillment. These include laws on the government, on the 
federal executive bodies, on normative legal acts, on the 
federal state service, on the bases of the organization of 
government and executive bodies in the components of the Russian 
Federation, and on the status of deputies of the State Duma and 
members of the Federation Council. 
  The Russian Federation president's Message "On Strengthening 
the Russian State" raises the most topical problems. This was 
stated by Aleksandr Shokhin, deputy of the State Duma and 
minister of the economy. 
  The president's message as applied to the economy "should be 
used to establish the normal mechanisms of market relations," he 
stressed. 
  He emphasized that first and foremost "the state should 
learn 
how to collect all the taxes which now exist and establish 
strict currency, financial, and banking control." 
  The Russian Federation president's message to parliament 
contains answers to the questions which are being thrown up 
today by the time and the actual situation, according to Vasiliy 
Tarasenko, chairman of the Federation Council Committee for the 
Affairs of the Federation and the Policy of the Regions. He 
suggested that "deputies and voters received in the Message what 
they expected to hear." The main point is that Boris Yeltsin's 
program "is based on the firm conviction that the democratic 
state's new Constitution should work." Each of his arguments is 
backed up by specific articles of the Constitution, Vasiliy 
Tarasenko explained.

<F P=106> ["Russian Federation President's Message to the Federal </F>
Assembly" "On Strengthening the Russian State. (Basic 
Guidelines for Domestic and Foreign Policy)," signed by Russian 
Federation President B. Yeltsin and dated the Kremlin, Moscow, 
24 February 1994] 
  [Text] Introduction 
  Russia is now experiencing one of the most important stages 
in the development of its state system. At the end of last year 
its first-ever democratic Constitution was adopted by national 
ballot. 
  Despite highly acute political struggle and spiritual 
turmoil, despite tremendous mental and physical weariness, 
Russian society found the strength to take a difficult yet 
crucial step on the path to renewal and stability. And that 
enhances its value many times over. It is the duty of all of us 
who are actually involved in Russia's destiny to make the most 
of this opportunity. 
  Two years ago we began the painful but ultimately necessary 
and healing reform of the economy. With tremendous difficulty 
we moved away from the edge of the economic abyss into which the 
old system was irreversibly pushing us and began the slow and 
not always confident move toward recovery. 
  Last year we momentarily looked into another chasm -- that 
of 
civil confrontation -- and recoiled in horror. We now have to 
do everything we can, and possibly more, to ensure that this 
never happens again. 
  The Russian Constitution is not only a symbol of our 
striving 
for national accord. It is a real basis for establishing 
cooperation in Russian society, primarily between the branches 
of federal power. Among the thousands of highly complex 
problems facing Russia today there is none that can be resolved 
amid confrontation and mutual mistrust. The resumption of the 
implacable struggle represents the way to deadlock, and there 
will be no way out. For those to whom Russia's citizens have 
entrusted the governance of the country it represents the route 
to political disgrace, damnation, and eternal oblivion. 
  The ideological vacuum that arose after the collapse of the 
old system is now being filled with futile disputes about the 
advantages of various "isms." Too often they become symbols of 
confrontation and hatred, signs of disaster. 
  We must all realize that a state cannot be built on ideas 
that cause schism and polarization in society. It must be based 
on natural values and concepts geared to the whole people and to 
every person individually. Such as security, freedom, 
prosperity, and solidarity. 
  Our strategic aim is to make Russia a prosperous country 
inhabited by people who are free, proud of their ancient 
history, and look boldly to the future; a country in which 
authority is based on law and does not oppress the citizen; a 
country with an efficient economy combining national features 
and world achievements. 
  This aim is cherished and understood by all Russian citizens 
regardless of their convictions, political orientation, social 
and property position, age, and nationality. We will be able to 
achieve it if we rally around the common practical task of 
strengthening the Russian state. We have the main condition 
needed to perform this task -- the Constitution. It outlines 
the legal framework of a strong and stable democratic state. 
  For us the main guideline in this work is the 
Constitutional formula -- Russia is a democratic, federative, 
rule-of-law, social, and secular state. 
  We must strengthen the Russian state because strengthening 
the state means: 
  -- reinforcing its institutions and establishing normal 
collaboration among them; 
  -- creating a normal mechanism for its interaction with 
society; 
  -- finding the optimum means for it to participate in 
economic processes; 
  -- creating effective mechanisms to ensure and defend the 
rights and freedoms of every person regardless of nationality, 
religion, or social position; 
  -- providing Russian citizens with confidence and 
tranquillity in their country, on the streets of its cities and 
villages, in their homes and apartments; 
  -- securing a fitting place for Russia in the world 
community. 
  Russia will not be strong unless it is united. The most 
lasting guarantee of the country's unity and the equality of the 
peoples inhabiting it will be the implementation of the 
principles of federative relations enshrined in the Constitution. 
  Ordinary human values, respect for democracy and for the law 
will become ingrained if the state actively promotes the 
formation of a civil society, supports civil democratic 
initiative, shows farsightedness during the complex transitional 
period by supporting culture, science, and education, and 
establishes dialogue with various religions and faiths. 
  A rule-of-law state must be strong in order to guarantee 
people's security, fight crime, and take the offensive against 
corruption. 
  A strong state is the basis for continuing reform, 
overcoming 
the crisis, organizing the structural reorganization of the 
economy, and creating the conditions for its stabilization and 
development. 
  Russia has an interest in ensuring economic, cultural, 
family, and ordinary human ties among the new independent 
states. A highly important condition for this is for each of 
these states to acknowledge the priority of human rights and the 
need to defend the interests of ethnic, cultural, and linguistic 
minorities. 
  It is in Russia's interests to create favorable external 
conditions for the country's development. This must be achieved 
by a proper and friendly but at the same time firm and 
consistent foreign policy in which the desire for cooperation 
does not conflict with the country's national interests and 
Russian citizens' sense of national pride. 
  The country is at a historical crossroads. One path leads to 
heedless political confrontation, the breakup of the state, and 
human tragedy; the other leads to constructive accord and 
awareness of the immutable aim, common to all without 
distinction of views or political stance, of strengthening the 
Russian state for the good of its citizens. 
  We all need mutual understanding. It will be found if 
everyone, primarily the president, the Federal Assembly, and the 
government, is able to organize coordinated work. 
  This Russian Federation [RF] president's message marks an 
important step in this direction. The message declares the head 
of state's political course. The president is not encroaching 
on the competence of any federal body of state power. At the 
same time the political, economic, and social guidelines 
contained in the message are a basis for evaluating the activity 
of all state bodies. 
  In accordance with Point "F" of the RF Constitution and 
based 
on: 
  a desire to ensure a more balanced and better-considered 
approach when defining the basic guidelines for domestic and 
foreign policy; 
  the RF president's constitutional duty to ensure the 
coordinated operation and interaction of state bodies, 
  I am sending the RF Federal Assembly my annual message "On 
Strengthening the Russian State (Basic Guidelines for Domestic 
and Foreign Policy)." 

<H5>    1. The Rule-of-Law State </H5>

<H6>    1.1. The Constitution and Legislation </H6>
  The Constitution adopted by national ballot 12 December 1993 
created the preconditions for building a strong state in Russia. 
The new system of state power enshrined by the Constitution 
accords with democratic standards. 
  The formulation of the Constitution took place amid the 
most severe political confrontation. That could not help having 
an impact on the legal quality of some articles. 
  In the new political situation and on the basis of the 
adopted Constitution the continuation of stage-by-stage 
constitutional reform is a justified and lawful process. But it 
is at the same time important to act without haste, not to give 
in to the transitory political situation, and to take into 
consideration the practical experience that will be accumulated 
in implementing the provisions of the Constitution as society 
develops. 
  The important stage of Russia's transformation into a 
democratic state is now coming to a close. A democratic system 
of power is being shaped on the basis of the Constitution. 
  The institution of the presidency, whose powers are designed 
to strengthen the state system and defend constitutional values, 
has acquired new political and legal substance. 
  The role and place of the government take new expression in 
the Constitution. It is an autonomous constitutional 
institution, capable of bearing full responsibility for the 
decisions it adopts. At the same time the government acts 
within the framework of the laws and edicts and in accordance 
with the policy of the president. 
  In December 1993 a parliament appeared in Russia -- the 
Federal Assembly. Without developed parliamentarism, 
full-fledged democracy is impossible. 
  The justice system will be renewed and reformed in the very 
near future. Its role hitherto has been far-removed from that 
which the judiciary should play in a rule-of-law state. 
  The Constitution created a favorable basis for the 
interaction of all branches of power, primarily the president 
and the parliament. However, the Constitution only defines the 
legal conditions for the joint work of the president and the 
Federal Assembly. A desirable psychological climate for mutual 
relations is also essential. That is political culture. 
  Annual presidential messages are one element in this. The 
message is not a directive, but nor is it a collection of good 
intentions. The president possesses sufficient constitutional 
potential to influence the state of affairs. A parliament 
respecting the president's powers will not put up artificial 
barriers to the implementation of the Basic Guidelines for 
Domestic and Foreign Policy. That is the accord which the 
people expect from the authorities. It is on this that the 
strengthening of our state and civil peace in the country 
primarily depend. 
  The stability of society, the defense of its basic values, 
primarily human rights, and the safeguarding of Russia's 
national interests in many respects depend on how effectively 
the democratic power works, whether it is able to overcome the 
gulf between constitutional principles and real practice. 
  One of the reasons for this gulf is that a deep struggle is 
still under way in society and the state apparatus between the 
supporters and opponents of a democratic system. A clash of 
interests is characteristic of any free society. But it is 
fruitful as long as it is conducted within a system of 
democratic values. 
  That is a necessary restriction, and it must be the 
criterion 
for the legal assessment of any politician, any political 
organization, any state institution. In particular, we cannot 
in the future permit the activity of parties, movements, or 
other associations that encroach on the foundations of the 
constitutional system or advocate and sow social, ethnic, and 
religious enmity and hatred. Likewise, such anticonstitutional 
manifestations cannot be permitted under cover of a deputy's 
status or a state post. 
  Disregard by the authorities of infringements of the 
constitutional system means either an inability or a reluctance 
to defend democracy by means of state coercion even though this 
be directly dictated by the Constitution. 
  Another fundamental reason for the gulf between democratic 
principles and state practice is that, having renounced the 
command principle of exercising power, the state has not been 
able to fully master the rule-of-law principle. This has 
elicited such threatening phenomena as: 
  -- an uncontrolled increase in managerial personnel in all 
spheres, which reduces the effectiveness of authority and 
distorts the whole system of government; 
  -- flourishing bureaucracy, which is stifling the growth of 
new economic relations, distorting the state's social policy, 
and having an oppressive effect on people's social state; 
  -- the involvement of officials at various levels of 
government in the political struggle -- which causes state 
decisions to be sabotaged; 
  -- corruption, which has infiltrated the state and municipal 
apparatus; 
  -- a dangerously low level of executive [ispolnitelskaya] 
discipline; 
  -- lack of coordination in the work of ministries, 
departments, and other state bodies. 
  It must be openly admitted that democratic principles of 
organizing power are increasingly being discredited. A negative 
image is developing of democracy as a weak, amorphous authority 
that does little for most people and primarily upholds its own 
corporate interests. Russian society has acquired freedom but 
has not yet perceived democracy as a system of strong state 
power which is at the same time wholly accountable to the people. 
  It is therefore essential during the new stage to create and 
fine-tune the practical mechanisms of democracy. This problem 
can be resolved if we radically boost the effectiveness of state 
power, ensuring precise and unswerving observance of the 
Constitution and the laws, employing if necessary the mandatory 
attribute of authority -- state coercion -- based solely on the 
law. 
  This is a problem of paramount importance, and it must be 
tackled by the joint efforts of the president, the Federal 
Assembly, the government, and other bodies of state power. It 
is necessary in the near future to formulate and adopt laws 
which establish clear rules for the functioning of state bodies, 
primarily executive bodies. They must make provision for 
effective mechanisms of supervision and accountability, making 
it possible to adopt legal acts which are really feasible and 
which thus eschew arbitrary interpretation -- legal acts which 
are economically costed and which incorporate concrete penalties 
for their nonimplementation. These include the laws On the 
Government, On Federal Executive Bodies, On Normative-Legal 
Acts, On Federal State Service, On the Basic Principles of 
Organizing Representative and Executive Bodies of Power in RF 
Components, and On the Status of State Duma Deputies and 
Federation Council Members. 
  It is necessary to revise normative acts at federal, 
regional, and municipal levels with a view to radically reducing 
the sphere of operation of the so-called authorization 
[razreshitelnyy] principle and replacing it with the 
notification [uvedomitelnyy] principle. 
  In the practical activity of executive bodies supervisory 
functions and officials' personal responsibility for failure to 
implement legal acts must be a top priority. The work of state 
bodies and officials must be assessed not only on the results of 
their managerial influence on the situation but also, first and 
foremost, on the standard of their implementation of legal acts 
and decisions of higher-ranking bodies adopted within their 
remit. 
  In a rule-of-law state authority is associated with the law, 
which is a mandatory feature of such a state. Therefore the 
development of the law is a pressing avenue in a policy of 
strengthening the Russian state. 
  The main role in this important matter is played by the 
Federal Assembly. It is necessary to single out the following 
as priorities in legal reform: 
  -- the creation of effective legal mechanisms which 
guarantee 
the rights and freedoms of the individual and the citizen. 
Today the most urgent matters in this sphere are the Housing 
Code, the Code of Labor Laws, the Law on Public Measures, 
changes to the Law On Defense of Consumer Rights, and the Laws 
on State Social Insurance, On the Subsistence Minimum, and On 
Resolving Collective Labor Disputes; 
  -- the development of the legal foundations of a market 
economy (primarily the adoption of a new Civil Code); 
  -- the improvement of procedural, criminal, administrative, 
and other sectors of legislation designed to ensure the rights 
of the individual and of society and to protect them against 
organized crime, corruption, and other criminal manifestations. 
  Those sectors of the law which are just beginning to develop 
or are lacking at present require particular attention. These 
being banking law, law on bills of exchange [vekselnoye pravo], 
tax law, corporate management law, information law, computer 
law, etc. 
  Legal reform must be based on the following principles: 
  -- systemic new legislation (the adoption of packages of 
legislative acts, the exclusion of duplicative acts and legal 
loopholes, etc); 
  -- legal economy (the adoption of fewer normative acts, the 
use of methods of codifying legal acts, etc); 
  -- the unity of the legal system (the establishment of a 
clear hierarchy of legal acts both at federal level and within 
the system of mutual relations with Federation components). 
<H6>  1.2 Judicial Reform </H6>
  If a state has a strong judicial system, then the state 
itself is strong. It is strong because the legislative and 
executive authorities do not expend enormous amounts of effort 
on struggling for the implementation of their respective 
decisions, and they are delivered from the temptation to act by 
illegal means. 
  The judiciary fulfills the main role in defending the law 
everywhere. Its strength is that it is devoid (at any rate it 
should be devoid) of any political interests. Its main and sole 
interest is the law as an independent value. 
  In Russia today judicial institutions are fragmented, their 
jurisdiction does not yet extend to all legal relationships, and 
in many ways the legislative base of justice is obsolete and 
incomplete. 
  The federal authority is thus faced with the pressing task 
of 
deciding how to carry out judicial reform as soon as possible. 
Its objective is the formation of effective justice operating 
on strong legal and democratic principles. 
  Judicial reform should ensure: 
  -- universality of legal protection (the chance of 
protection 
against any manifestations of arbitrariness or violence); 
  -- access to justice; 
  -- prompt legal protection for rights and legitimate 
interests; 
  -- certainty that legal decisions will be implemented. 
  Citizens' legal protection is weak. Many courts do not 
regard constitutional provisions as norms for direct action. 
For various reasons, citizens frequently refuse to exercise 
their right to legal protection. 
  Judicial decisions, primarily in the civil legal sphere, are 
frequently not implemented and are ignored by those to whom they 
are addressed. 
  The principle of the independence of judges and their 
subordination to the law alone has still not become the norm. A 
number of levers that can be used to exert pressure still remain 
in the hands of officials. Judges' working conditions, level of 
social protection, and day-to-day backup depend to a 
considerable extent on how well disposed the local leadership is. 
  The interests of strengthening the state demand reform of 
the 
work of the RF Constitutional Court. Apart from resolving the 
issue of electing more constitutional judges, we also need to 
finalize and adopt a new law on the Constitutional Court as soon 
as possible. At the same time we should also take account of 
the defects of the previous law, which distorted the essential 
nature of this important democratic institution. 
  We need to reform not just the competence of the 
Constitutional Court, not just the guarantees that its decisions 
will be implemented, and not just the status of the judges, but 
also the actual process of constitutional justice. 
  We also need to adopt laws which enshrine these new 
procedural principles in criminal, civil, administrative, and 
arbitration proceedings, primarily the principles of an 
adversarial judicial process and the equality of the two parties. 
  The jury system is one of the most democratic forms of legal 
procedure. The appropriate bodies should therefore summarize 
the results of the experiment begun in 1993 as soon as possible 
and submit proposals for the possible full-scale introduction of 
this institution into legal practice. 
  We need a law on judicial administration which establishes 
general principles for constructing the Russian legal system and 
the particular features of legal regulation of the various 
subsystems of the judiciary. We should also restore progressive 
institutions such as justices of the peace and appeal 
proceedings. 
  A pressing need has developed to isolate administrative 
justice as an autonomous subsystem. It should be composed of 
courts or the judicial offices of general courts with the 
purpose of examining cases relating to the legitimacy of actions 
taken by state and municipal organs and officials. 
  In order to democratically reform the activity of the 
highest 
court within the system of RF general courts, we need a law on 
the RF Supreme Court. 
  In order to create effective justice we need to adopt 
without 
delay a legislative act that establishes guarantees for state 
protection of judges, jurors, witnesses, victims, and other 
participants in the judicial process. 
  Courts need to be fully financed. This is important not just 
in order to lift the prestige of the judiciary but also to 
ensure the courts' full independence of government bodies at all 
levels. 
<H6>  1.3 Protection of the Citizen, the Law, and the State </H6>
  Strengthening the state is inconceivable without curbing 
crime. An enormous difficulty, however, is that a strong state 
is needed in order to combat crime effectively. The problem is 
so acute that it cannot be postponed. We are talking about a 
realistic assessment of the situation and the adoption of all 
possible measures to change it for the better. 
  The unbridled growth of crime is creating a major threat to 
the state and society and to the life, health, and property of 
citizens. Crime currently constitutes a threat to Russia's 
national security. 
  Over the last four years the overall level of crime has 
almost doubled. Dangerous trends in the dynamics and structure 
of crime have been getting stronger. 
  The situation is complicated by the crisis which is also 
being experienced by the law-enforcement organs. Their 
professional cadre nucleus has been significantly weakened. All 
this is having a negative impact on crime detection and the 
prestige of the organs engaged in maintaining law and order, 
which in turn means that lawbreakers go unpunished and the 
criminal world increases its aggression. 
  Recent measures have been taken that are designed to 
concentrate the state's efforts on this important area, and a 
federal program for combating crime in 1994-1995 has been 
prepared. Its objective is to establish additional guarantees 
for the protection of citizens' lives, health, and property and 
other rights, and also to ensure public safety and law and order. 
  The implementation of these planned measures is dependent on 
appropriate financing, which requires the Russian parliament to 
make difficult budget decisions. However difficult the state's 
economic position, we need to do everything we can to satisfy 
the most urgent financial and material requirements of the 
bodies engaged in maintaining law and order. 
  The Ministry of Internal Affairs is to adopt cadre and 
organizational measures to ensure the normal functioning of the 
law-enforcement organs. We need to free them from implementing 
functions and bureaucratic work that are alien to them, and we 
also need to break down departmental barriers and eliminate 
legal and organizational confusion in the activity of the 
law-enforcement organs. 
  We need to form within the structure of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs a rigidly centralized system of subunits for 
combating organized crime, and first and foremost we need to 
supply these subunits with the best cadres, hardware, and 
financial assistance. 
  The interests of the fight against crime demand the 
implementation of a single legal policy by all bodies and 
officials empowered to carry out criminal prosecutions, be they 
examiners or investigators, prosecutors or judges. 
  We need to ensure social protection for the personnel of 
bodies engaged in maintaining law and order, and at the same 
time we need to strictly monitor how far they measure up to 
professional and moral requirements. 
  The effectiveness of the fight against crime presupposes 
consolidation of the legal base. To this end the Federal 
Assembly must examine and adopt an appropriate package of laws 
as urgently as possible. 
  We need to find legislative solutions to a number of issues 
relating to the fight against organized crime and corruption, 
including: 
  -- reinforcing criminal and other juridical penalties for 
all 
persons involved in organized criminal groups, particularly the 
ringleaders; 
  -- widening the base of evidence; 
  -- protecting those taking part in criminal trials; 
  -- adopting measures to prevent the "laundering" of money 
obtained by illegal methods; 
  -- adopting measures to prevent the emergence of organized 
crime within the state apparatus. 
  These issues must be reflected in federal laws designed to 
combat organized crime and corruption and in the laws on the 
federal state service. 
  We need to eliminate loopholes in the legal regulation of 
the 
fight against economic crime. First and foremost, there should 
be equal legal protection for all forms of property. We need 
acts designed to protect persons engaged in honest business 
activities, and at the same time we need acts on liability for 
dishonest competition and unscrupulous enterprise, false 
bankruptcy, misleading publicity, acquisition of credit by 
deception, violation of tax, customs, and licensing regulations, 
commercial bribery of people in unofficial positions, and 
computer fraud. 
  We need to formulate a fundamentally new system for warning 
us about instances of lawbreaking and neglect among children, 
adolescents, and young people, and we need to set up a network 
of state and social organizations to ensure social protection 
and corrective behavior for this section of the population. 
  We need a raft of measures to offer social assistance to 
people left without a permanent income or the means to survive. 
We need a legislative act that clearly regulates social 
rehabilitation measures for people released from jail. 
  The active integration of domestic crime with the 
international criminal world requires us to strengthen 
cooperation between Russia's law-enforcement organs and those of 
foreign countries. Russian accession to appropriate 
international conventions as soon as possible could serve as the 
legal base for this enlargement. We also need to ratify the 
Convention on Legal Assistance and Legal Relations in Civil, 
Family, and Criminal Cases, signed over two years ago by the CIS 
heads of state in Minsk. 
  The adoption of new Criminal, Criminal Procedure, and 
Criminal Enforcement Codes based on the principle of the 
priority of common human values are a measure that cannot be 
postponed. These codes should reflect the specific 
characteristics of new Russian statehood and stipulate proper 
protection for all its institutions. 
<H5>  2. Man in the Democratic State </H5>
<H6>  2.1. Human Rights </H6>
  The RF Constitution juridically guarantees the state's 
attitude toward human rights in line with contemporary 
perceptions of democracy and the principles of a civil society. 
  Man and his rights and freedoms are a supreme asset. The 
recognition, observance, and protection of human and civil 
rights and freedoms constitute the state's main obligation. 
  Power in a democratic state pursues neither the oppression 
of 
freedom nor external expansion. All its attributes of force are 
needed not for the self-assertion of authority but in order to 
ensure that every person is protected against all types of 
arbitrariness and violence, is conscious of his dignity, and 
plays the part of the state's equal partner. In other words, 
all the state's might must guarantee the safeguarding and 
protection of individuals' rights. 
  The Constitution defines the path which must be followed by 
state bodies. Specifically, it is no longer permissible for 
bodies of state power and local self-government to ignore in 
their practical work the provision that the RF Constitution has 
a direct effect throughout the RF's territory. This makes it 
possible to base judicial decisions directly on the 
Constitution, including cases when current laws are either 
lacking or are at odds with it. 
  The universally recognized principles and norms of 
international law and the RF's international treaties are a 
component of its legal system. Thus, state bodies and officials 
must organize their activity in compliance with international 
standards in the sphere of human rights and the legal protection 
of individuals. 
  But, following the Constitution's adoption, the gap between 
it and the current legislation in the sphere of human rights and 
the protection of individuals widened. Edicts of the RF 
president have partly filled the legal vacuum in question, but 
they cannot and must not constantly replace the laws. Thus, the 
task of bringing legislation in line with the Constitution is on 
the agenda. 
  With a view to normatively guaranteeing human rights, over 
the next two years it will be necessary: 
  -- to elaborate and adopt the laws directly envisaged by the 
Constitution; 
  -- to improve the federal laws currently in force; 
  -- to elaborate and adopt normative acts establishing a 
mechanism for the implementation of federal laws; 
  -- to bring the legal acts of the RF and the Federation 
components in the human rights sphere in line with the Russian 
Constitution. 
<H6>  2.2. The Safety of Individuals </H6>
  A democratic state has no right to invade citizens' private 
lives, but it must guarantee each person's individual safety and 
the protection of his dignity. 
  One of the most acute problems in the life of the state and 
society is the headlong rise in crime. This is one of the main 
factors hindering the implementation of reforms, and is alarming 
citizens as regards their lives and prosperity. The situation 
has become intolerable. Many correct words have been uttered 
about a war against crime. The results are far fewer. It is 
time to get down to specific deeds. 
  The idea that the democratic power is incapable of imposing 
order is being firmly implanted in the public's mind. It is 
necessary to overcome this dangerous misconception. On the 
contrary, people must gain confidence that only the democratic 
state is capable of guaranteeing their safety. 
  The problem of the safety of individuals must be solved 
immediately by applying effective legal, organizational, cadre, 
and financial measures. 
  Russia's citizens also need legal protection against 
arbitrary rule by the state structures themselves. It is 
necessary to create a developed and accessible system of legal 
aid for the population. 
  The level of the legal profession's [advokatura] development 
is an accurate indicator of the legal guarantees of human and 
civil rights and freedoms. It is necessary to legislatively 
guarantee the legal profession's independence and high standing 
and rule out any interference in its activity by bodies of state 
power. At the same time it is necessary to enshrine conditions 
for subsidized provision of various legal services to citizens 
in financial difficulties. 
  It is incumbent on the state to show concern for the 
population's health by recognizing the intrinsic value of the 
health of each one of Russia's citizens. 
  At the same time, the qualitative indicators of the state of 
the population's health have been steadily declining over the 
last 10 years. Demographic processes are developing negatively. 
Life expectancy is declining, the mortality rate is rising. 
There is a growing threat to citizens' sanitary and 
epidemiological safety. Only 60 percent of the population's 
needs for medicines were met in 1993. 
  The government's minimum task in 1994 is to prevent any 
further decline of the volume of medical and medicinal services 
to the population by pooling the various sources of finance and 
concentrating them along the most important avenues of health 
care: accident and emergency medical services, intensive care 
and resuscitation, family medical practice, and provision of 
medicines. 
  The reform of the medical services system is designed to 
stabilize and improve the situation in the health care sphere. 
Its objective is to satisfy the population's needs for 
high-quality and accessible medical and medicinal services and 
to create conditions promoting a healthy, active, and long life. 
  The reform must primarily make provisions for: 
  -- a structural restructuring of the sector and a transition 
to mandatory medical insurance for all citizens of Russia; 
  -- support for the state and municipal health care systems. 
  World experience shows that the introduction of medical 
insurance instead of a centralized health care system is the 
most rational and most reliable form of medical service. Under 
such a system, the patient's interests are protected not only by 
health care bodies but also by the insurance companies. 
  Medical insurance is only just coming into being in Russia. 
Nonetheless, the initial experience of work by territorial funds 
of mandatory medical insurance has shown that the set amount of 
insurance contributions is clearly inadequate and not in a 
position to fully compensate the rising prices of medical and 
medicinal services for the socially unprotected population 
groups. The government will have to find a way to gradually 
raise the insurance contributions. 
  High-quality treatment and preventive medicine are possible 
only on the basis of applying highly efficient medical 
technologies and the achievements of medical, biological, and 
technical sciences which require a modern production base. One 
of the important tasks of federal bodies of power is to promote 
its development by all possible means. It is necessary to 
involve on a large scale the country's enterprises, primarily 
those undergoing conversion, in the production of modern, 
high-quality medicines and medical equipment. 
  It is necessary to retain duty-free centralized imports only 
for vitally important medicines which are not produced in 
Russia. These measures will provide serious support for our 
country's medical industry. 
  The transformations in the health care system require 
legislative backup. In the near future the RF parliament will 
have to examine laws on the health care systems, on patients' 
rights, on medicines, on protection of the family, and a series 
of other laws. 
  For a very long time our country practiced a feckless 
approach toward the creation of new production units and the 
construction of industrial facilities, using predatory methods 
for the utilization of our natural wealth. Nowadays people have 
to pay for these miscalculations. 
  Vast regions in the country have become ecological disaster 
zones. The lives and health of tens of millions of people 
inhabiting these territories, as well as their flora and fauna, 
are under grave threat. A critical situation prevails in a 
series of places, especially in major industrial centers. 
  The public is perfectly justifiably alarmed about the 
condition of the environment and is making fair demands for 
urgent specific work to improve the situation. 
  The citizens' right to enjoy a favorable environment is 
enshrined in the Constitution. Therefore, it is the 
constitutional obligation of all bodies of power to create 
conditions promoting environmental recovery. It is necessary to 
be guided by the principle that ecological safety is a component 
of Russia's national security. 
  The government has elaborated a series of immediate 
ecological programs, but their implementation is progressing 
extremely slowly. The effect of inadequate financing is felt. 
The Federal Assembly and the government will have to give 
serious attention to this problem. 
  The ecological situation in many regions can be repaired by 
federal services exercising ecological monitoring, protecting 
natural resources, and regulating their utilization. For this 
purpose it is important to ensure that their work is not limited 
to just identifying violations and that they make full use of 
all the potential at their disposal. 
  A decisive turnabout in environmental protection work must 
be 
ensured through a long-term state strategy for protection of the 
environment, whose main provisions were ratified in early 
February 1994 by edict of the RF president. 
  Attention in it is focused mainly on: 
  -- guaranteeing ecologically safe and stable development in 
conditions of market relations; 
  -- protecting the environment (including alleviating the 
critical ecological situation in major cities and industrial 
centers and guaranteeing the population's radiation safety); 
  -- ensuring the recovery and restoration of Russia's 
disrupted ecosystems; 
  -- actively participating in the solution of global 
ecological problems. 
  In line with this strategy, the government has been 
instructed to elaborate within two months an action plan for 
environmental protection in 1994-1995. This year the government 
has also been instructed to elaborate a concept of the RF's 
transition to a model of stable development ensuring balanced 
solution of socioeconomic and ecological problems. 
  The complexity and scale of these problem demand 
constructive 
collaboration between federal and regional bodies of power, 
bodies of local self-government, entrepreneurs, and public 
associations. We will need a considered application of both 
economic and administrative regulators within the law's 
framework, developed legal backing, and pursuit of targeted 
socioeconomic, financial, and taxation policies. 
<H6>  2.3. State Support for the Institutions of Civil Society </H6>
  Without a developed civil society, state power will 
inevitably acquire a despotic and totalitarian character. It is 
only thanks to the civil society that this power starts serving 
man and becomes a protector of freedom. 
  It is a specific feature of the Russian situation that the 
foundations of a new democratic state are being laid in parallel 
with the establishment of a civil society. 
  Since a democratic state cannot exist without a civil 
society, the state is objectively interested in supporting 
public institutions. This does not mean the state interfering 
in the life of civil structures or vesting state authority 
powers in public associations; it means selectively helping 
those civil society institutions which are capable of directly 
boosting the democratic potential of authority. 
  The mass media have an invaluable role to play in shaping 
the 
civil society. The protection of their freedom is a strategic 
task. While this freedom exists, democracy is defended by one 
of the most important protective factors. 
  The Russian mass media today are undergoing major 
qualitative 
changes associated with their transition to market tracks. 
Numerous problems have accumulated. Just as in the last two 
years, finances remain a key issue. Under no circumstances 
should the press be left without subsidies in 1994. 
  It is necessary to gradually undertake the destatization of 
the mass media, primarily of newspapers and journals. The state 
authorities must hand their functions as founders over to 
editorial offices and journalists' collectives. 
  It is clear that the state will be unable to cope with the 
financial maintenance of television and radio broadcasting 
companies. The package of presidential edicts on television and 
radio broadcasting issued in December last year defined the 
course of state policy in this sphere. It is important, 
however, to ensure that Russia's information area is not broken 
up and fragmented in the process of implementing practical 
steps. The state television and radio channel must be retained. 
  The time has finally come to develop the legislative base of 
mass media activities. A law on the right of access to 
information must come first in this sphere. It is also 
necessary to prepare draft laws regulating the activity of 
television and radio broadcasting companies, especially since 
some sound work has already been done in this regard. 
  One of the factors which complicate the formation of a 
democratic political system and a civil society is the weak and 
amorphous nature of parties and public organizations. There is 
the great inertia of interparty and intergroup struggle, in 
which the citizens' interests are relegated to the back burner. 
  The Federal Assembly elections in December 1993 demonstrated 
significant shortcomings in the legislative backup for the 
activity of parties, public associations, and mass media during 
the election campaign. 
  It is necessary to ensure that the next presidential and 
parliamentary elections are held on the basis of new and updated 
laws. It is equally important to define at federal level the 
main provisions of electoral legislation in Federation 
components. 
  A special role will have to be played by the law on 
political 
parties which, in parallel with general democratic provisions, 
must boost the development of a multiparty system. 
  It is important that this law should guarantee: 
  -- the strengthening of the parties' role as main channel of 
political activity associated with the shaping of power; 
  -- the creation of conditions encouraging the consolidation 
of parties and the formation of a stable party system; 
  -- the orientation of party activity toward ascertaining and 
expressing the opinions of different strata of society. 
  It is expedient to ensure that the law on political parties 
and the law on elections are coordinated and complement each 
other. 
  Laws on elections ought to be elaborated on the basis of a 
critical interpretation of the experience of the first 
multiparty elections and the dominant participation of major 
political blocs in the elections. 
  An important avenue of lawmaking should be the procedure for 
using the mass media both during the election campaign and in 
the period between elections. Here we cannot avoid a 
legislative regulation of television and radio airtime allocated 
for election campaigning. In this regard, the provision of free 
airtime by state-owned mass media must become one of the forms 
of state support for the multiparty system. 
  It is expedient to utilize the experience accumulated during 
the last elections. The Information Arbitration Court, now the 
Court of Appeal, must sum up this experience and submit relevant 
proposals to the president. 
  The adoption of separate legislative acts on parties and on 
public organizations (associations) will draw a line between 
political activity as such and the activity of organizations and 
citizens aimed at solving nonpolitical problems. This will 
bring public organizations into the implementation of the 
state's social policy. The state will have to partly finance 
the activity of public associations engaged in resolving 
priority social tasks. This will make it possible to partly ease 
the burden of the state and cut back the state apparatus. A 
considered and legislatively enshrined procedure for the use of 
state funds by public organizations will help to enhance the 
efficiency of their utilization. 
  State support for public organizations must take the 
following forms: 
  -- providing subsidies on a competitive basis; 
  -- giving them the right to utilize state property; 
  -- granting them tax concessions and full or partial 
exemption from payment for services rendered by state-owned 
enterprises. 
  While helping, the state must have the right to monitor the 
utilization of any financial or other resources that have been 
made available. 
  This mechanism must be embodied in laws on public 
organizations (on freedom of association), on trade unions, on 
noncommercial organizations, on charitable foundations and 
charitable activity. 
  One of the signs of a developed civil society is the system 
of institutions of self-government. These institutions make it 
possible to impart a constructive meaning to people's free 
activity and link it with self-responsibility. 
  This is precisely why the Constitution singles out a 
separate 
sphere of civic autonomy and activeness -- local self-government 
-- and lays down that bodies of local self-government are not 
part of the system of state power but function autonomously and 
are accountable to their population. 
  But this does not mean that the state can completely 
distance 
itself from legally regulating the structure, functions, and 
powers of local self-government. It is impossible to ignore the 
fact that this is not only a sphere for residents' 
self-organization but also a specific level of power. 
<H5>  3. Federalism -- a Territorial Form of Democracy </H5>
<H6>  3.1. The Integrity of the State and Regional Policy </H6>
  Strengthening the state means above all the strengthening of 
its territorial integrity. The problem does not boil down 
merely to ensuring the inviolability of state borders and 
protecting the country from external threats. For all the 
importance of these tasks, what causes alarm are manifestations 
of the country's disintegration, and internal tendencies which 
threaten its territorial integrity. 
  These misgivings are caused by the fact that the radical 
transformations in the economic and political spheres have 
coincided with the crisis of unitarism which has outlived its 
time. For Russia, which has begun democratic transformations, 
the only real method of strengthening Russia is the creation of 
a modern federative state. 
  The task of the federal authorities is to find the kind of 
form of state structure such that the regions' natural desire 
for greater autonomy does not create a threat to the integrity 
of Russia. 
  The first steps along this path have already been taken. The 
Constitution itself has been prepared with the direct 
participation of the components of the Federation. During the 
Constitutional Conference many contradictions were successfully 
eliminated and it proved possible to find juridical formulas by 
way of a compromise which have become the basis for further 
progression forward. 
  The regions are actively arranging coordinating and 
managerial links with each other. A mechanism of 
"self-attunement" has begun to function thanks to which new 
socio-economic complexes, undivided by administrative 
boundaries, are beginning to take shape in Russia. Prototypes 
of interregional structures of management have appeared and 
these have taken over a proportion of the functions which 
previously used to be fulfilled by the unitary center. These 
are interregional associations whose activity encompasses the 
entire Russian Federation. 
  The growth of the regions' autonomy and the reduction of the 
powers of federal authority do not signify a weakening of the 
state and do not create a threat to the country's unity. The 
constitution lays down the basis principles which guarantee: 
  -- the immutability of the state's territorial integrity; 
  -- the equality of the rights enjoyed by the members of the 
federation between themselves and with respect to the federal 
organs of state power; 
  the unity of the foundations of the state system (observance 
by each region of such fundamental principles of statehood as 
sovereignty of the people, separation of powers, multiplicity of 
parties, and equal electoral rights of citizens). 
  -- freedom of movement for people, for the dissemination of 
information, and for the movement of goods and money throughout 
the state's territory (internal administrative boundaries cannot 
be transformed into state or economic borders); 
  -- the supremacy of federal legislation; 
  -- the impermissibility of actions directed at the 
unilateral 
change of status of a component of the Federation. 
  Like all the other articles of the federal Constitution, 
these principles are mandatory for implementation by the 
authorities and citizens in any region of Russia. In everything 
which does not conflict with these principles and which does not 
fall within the competence of the Russia Federation, the regions 
have freedom in regard to their own development. 
  The time of the struggle of the regions with the "center" 
for 
their rights is receding into history. The Constitution has 
granted all regions of Russia broad rights. Those regional 
politicians who are still demanding powers are breaking through 
a brick wall right next to an open door. The chief problem is 
to proceed to the real assimilation of these rights as soon as 
possible. 
  The broad handover of powers to regional authorities does 
not 
in any way mean that the federal authorities are withdrawing 
from the exercise of any influence whatsoever on the regional 
life of Russian society. On the contrary, under the new 
conditions there is a growing need for the development and 
implementation of the Russian state's new regional strategy. 
  This task was set by the president back in April last year 
although its implementation was rendered difficult until after 
the constitutional crisis was overcome. 
  The basic principles and aims of regional strategy consist 
in 
the following: 
  -- overcoming sharp differences between regions in terms of 
the standard of living and levels of development; 
  -- the development of interregional cooperation and the 
maximal use of the potential deriving from the regions' 
diversity; 
  -- the use of methods of incentive and regulation and the 
renunciation of administration by injunction; 
  -- the prosperity of citizens; 
  -- the transition from narrowly economic toward broader -- 
societal and social -- goals; 
  -- ensuring territorial fairness (no region must acquire any 
unjustified privileges). 
  An important instrument for perfecting the fundamentals of 
federalism must be a law on the general principles of organizing 
the representative and executive organs of state power in the 
components of the Federation. 
  In the political sphere direct elections of regional 
authorities are the guarantee for regional autonomy. Regional 
authorities must be subordinated not to the federal authorities 
but to the federal Constitution. 
  The division of sources of taxation receipts among federal, 
regional, and local levels must become a guartantee for the 
economic autonomy of the regions. Then each level of state 
power will be really independent from the others. Citizens and 
enterprises can function as tax-payers. 
  Ensuring the rights of local self-government is one of the 
most important conditions for preserving territorial integrity. 
The competence of its organs encompasses the satisfaction of 
the most crucial, everyday, vitally essential needs of the 
people which neither federal, nor regional authorities are able 
to provide. 
  Local self-government has deep historical roots in Russian 
political culture, taking the form of the zemstvo. For the 
young Russian democracy local self-government can become an 
effective means of galvanizing citizens and a means of involving 
them in constructive political work which yields real practical 
results. 
  It is precisely at the level of local self-government that 
various forms of the national-cultural developoment of the 
peoples of Russia can acquire pratical embodiment.. 
  Federal power is faced with a very important task -- to 
strictly delimit the functions, rights, duties, and 
responsibility between the organs of state power and local 
self-government. At the same time their material and financial 
sources have to be divided. For this purpose it is essential to 
adopt a federal law on the general principles of organizing 
local self-government. Taking this as a base, the organs of 
power of the components of the Federation must adopt legal acts 
regulating the structure and powers of the organs of local 
self-government in their own regions taking account of national 
and local traditions. 
  The president, the Federal Assembly, the Government, and 
the components of the Federation must participate in drawing up 
and implementing regional policy. Possibilities now exist for 
legislative and executive authorities to exercise a proper 
influence in this sphere. The appearance of the Federation 
Council -- the first "chamber of the regions" in Russia's 
history -- will help substantially to raise the standard of 
discussion of regional problems. This chamber has a big part to 
play in developing laws connected with resolving a whole range 
of the country's regional problems. Committes for Federation 
affairs and regional policy have been set up in both the 
Federation Council and in the State Duma. 
  During the development of genuine federalism new problems 
will surely crop up and we have to be prepared to solve them. 
One of them is the possible growth of contradictions between 
the regions. Such contradictions existed before but they were 
resolved by administrative means from Moscow. But now, by an 
large, it will be the regions themseves which will have to 
overcome these contradictions. When an impasse is encountered 
the president will use conciliatory procedures and set up 
conference commissions to resolve disagreements between the 
organs of state power of the Russian Federation and the organs 
of state power of its components, and likewise between the 
organs of state power of the federation's components themselves. 
  Treaties between the federal authority and the subjects of 
the Federation concerning the demarcation of areas of 
responsibility and powers operate as a most important mechanism 
for the self-attunement of federative relations. A treaty of 
this type has been signed with the Republic of Tatarstan. 
  The regulation of relations between the federal authority 
and 
the Chechen Republic represents a special problem. The holding 
of free democratic elections in Chechnya and talks on the 
demarcation of powers with the federal authorities could become 
a basis for this. 
  An immediate task is to draw up and adopt basic laws which 
will make it possible to convey the constitutional principles of 
the new federative relations into the real pratice of the 
application of the law. The following laws are necessary: 
  -- on the principles of the demarcation of areas of 
responsibility and the mutual delegation of powers between the 
federal "center" and the components of the Federation; 
  -- on the procedure for the admission to the Russian 
Federation of a new compnent or for the formation of a new 
component within its composition; 
  -- on the procedure for changing the constitutional-legal 
status of a component of the Russian Federation. 
<H6>  3.2. Russia's Economic Unity </H6>
  The divergent starting conditions and nonidentical economic 
policies of local authorities are intensifying the divergences 
between different regions, thus forming the potential for the 
disintegration of Russia. It is intolerable that, when coming 
into conflict with the Constitution, the authorities of the 
regions: 
  -- limit the freedom of economic, scientific, technical, amd 
other contractual relationships between enterprisers of 
different components of the Federation; 
  -- create obstacles to the movement of goods, financial 
resources, and to the movement of people across administrative 
boundaries of territories; 
  -- violate the unity of the principles of taxation. 
  Each region of the Federation is entitled to apply its own 
tactical methods when implementing the strategic tasks of 
economic reform. But no region has the right to use these 
methods in such a way that in fact they would cancel out the 
common goals, separate it from the Federation, and would inflict 
direct or indirect harm on other regions. The unity of the 
Federation's economic space is inviolable. 
  In order to strengthen it, it is essential to ensure the 
priority development of a unified infrastructure (energy, 
transportation, communications, information science), and to 
provide for rigorous sanctions against regions which impede the 
transfer of taxes to the federal budget or fail to discharge 
other obligations to the federal organs. 
  The federal authorities, finally, must take exhaustive steps 
to complete the process of the demarcation of state property 
both between the Federation's components themselves and also 
between the federal "center" and the regions. Russia's 
government should within a very tight timeframe make an 
inventory of the legal arrangements for the management of 
federal property located on the territory of the components of 
the Russian Federation, and of its material condition. 
  The concessions which have been granted to certain regions, 
some of which are economically inexpedient or simply unfair in 
relation to the country's citizens living in other territories, 
ought to be revisited. A system is necessary based on unified 
criteria for granting concessions with regard to federal taxes 
and credits. It is essential to render support to enterprises 
working in accordance with federal programs and create 
incentives for the development of Russian interregional 
corporations. It is essential to ensure the unconditional 
fulfillment of the Constitution by sweeping away any regional 
barriers in the way of the movement of goods, money, and 
services. 
  Regions cannot be the subjects of economic relations. Their 
authorities are not entitled to supplant the true subjects -- 
the citizens and enterprises -- merely because they are located 
on a territory which is administratively subordinate to the 
regional authorities. 
  At the same time it cannot be allowed that the struggle 
against economic separatism should infringe the rights of the 
Federation's regions or should lead to the restoration of a 
unitary state. The course toward the handover to them of an 
increasingly large volume of powers must continue. 
  Federal authority will undertake support for economically 
depressed regions through the Federal Regional Development Fund. 
The main source of money for the support of the weak must be the 
territorial rent which is emerging in a number of regions on the 
strength of more favorable natural and geographic factors, and 
also as a consequence of former preferential state capital 
investments. 
  While ensuring the minimum necessary level of support for 
the 
systems of education and health care and for the institutions of 
the labor market, the federal authorities must not limit the 
autonomy of the regions in the choice of their own system of 
social support for the population adapted to local conditions. 
  It is very important that the efforts of the federal organs 
of power should be supplemented by energetic and all-around 
activity by the components of the Federation. The general path 
for state influence on regional development is not to make 
direct transfers of money from the federal budget to the 
regional budget but to use these resources in joint programs on 
a parity basis. The development of small and medium cities, 
highway construction and so forth ought, for example, to be 
approached from this angle. The program for the development of 
small and medium cities that is with the government ought to be 
examined, taking this into account. 
  A big role must be played by the territorial organs of 
federal executive power envisioned by the constitution. It is 
they that will shoulder the main burden in devising and 
implementing federal and interregional programs for the 
territories. Support will be needed for interregional 
associations operating for the purposes of economic integration. 
It is a question of the comprehensive utilization and 
protection of natural resources, regional programs and their 
financing on a shared basis. 
<H6>  3.3. Federalism and Interethnic Accord </H6>
  The strengthening of the Russian state is unthinkable 
without 
accord among the peoples inhabiting it. 
  A multitude of national problems has been engendered by the 
contradictory nature of two principles which, right from the 
beginning, were made the basis of the Russian Federation's state 
structure: the national-territorial principle and the 
administrative-territorial principle. This is being manifested 
clearly today when the redistribution of the functions and 
powers of the authorities between the federal organs and 
components of the federation is taking place. Under present 
conditions the historical necessity for their coexistence 
persists. At the same time the contradictions between them will 
be smoothed out on the basis of a new concept, enshrined in the 
Constitution, of the nation as a community of citizens 
[sograzhdanstvo]. 
  The Constitution proclaims the self-determination of the 
Russian Federation on behalf of all its multiethnic people as 
the vehicle of the sovereignty and single source of authority in 
the state; and likewise the source of authority in the 
republics, krays and oblasts is their entire population 
regardless of nationality. The division of inhabitants into 
representatives of so-called "indigenous" and "nonindigenous" 
nationalities is unconstitutional and therefore inadmissible. 
  The equality of rights and freedoms of all citizens 
regardless of their nationality, as provided for in the 
Constitution, must be strictly guaranteed. No ethnic group may 
possess an exclusive right of control over territory, 
institutions of power, and resources. The equality of rights 
calls for the necessity to adopt coordinated decisions which 
take account of the interests of the various national groups. 
  The integrity of the state is based to a significant degree 
on maintaining the unity of the civic society and the 
preservation of the diversity of its ethnic components. This is 
why a democratic nationalities policy is vitally necessary. It 
must be aimed at solving the following most urgent issues: 
  -- nationalities problems when building the federal state; 
  -- the defense of citizens' rights and of the ehtnic, 
religious, and linguistic communities which they make up; 
  -- the enthno-cultural development of the peoples of the 
Russian Federation; 
  -- the prevention and settlement of interethnic conflicts. 
  Above all the state is obliged to create conditions enabling 
the representatives of various nationalities to independently 
determine and implement their own social and cultural objectives 
and to form associations, unions, and other institutions of a 
civic society. In the economy this means above all the freedom 
of enterprise and equal rights of property for the citizens of 
all nationalities. In politics it means maintaining the 
national groups' diverse forms of self-government. 
  The self-organization of ethnic communities which do not 
have 
their own national-territorial entities on the territory of the 
Russian Federation or which live outside the boundaries of such 
entities is possible in various forms of national-cultural 
autonomy. The legal foundations of their activity is to be 
determined by the government and Federal Assembly. 
  The Federal, republic-regional, and local authorities are 
obliged to defend human rights in the ethnic sphere and give 
preferential support to the least protected ethnic groups. It 
is the state's task to preserve vulnerable ethnic cultures and 
communities, especially in the regions of the European North, 
Siberia, and the Far East. The pursuit of economic reforms in 
these regions must be accompanied by a package of measures to 
defend the rights of numerically small peoples, including: 
  -- budget financing of traditional sectors of the economy 
and 
social sphere; 
  -- the development of the social infrastructure of national 
settlements and the development of special forms of medical 
services and education taking into account the specific features 
of the way of life of numerically small peoples of the North; 
  -- the preservation of language, culture, and traditional 
habitat. 
  Priority state support is also essential for all ethnic 
categories of refugees and enforced exiles from zones of 
interethnic conflicts. Such problems are especially acute in 
the North Caucasus. 
  This year will see the 50th anniversary of a tragic event -- 
the forced resettlement of many peoples of Russia from their 
native localities. Overcoming the consequences of a repressive 
nationalities policy is one of the priority tasks of organs of 
power at all levels. Interethnic accord, readiness for 
dialogue, and a quest for compromise are especially important in 
solving these very complex problems. 
  The preservation and strentghening of the federative state 
depends directly on the national self-awareness of the Russians. 
In Russia Russians constitute the absolute majority of the 
peoplation -- 83 percent. They are not threatened by 
assimilation, a tendency to forget their mother tongue, or by 
the loss of their national originality. 
  At the same time it is impossible to deny the existence of a 
number of problems which are being encountered by Russians 
especially in certain republics of the Federation and in regions 
bordering on zones of interethnic conflicts. The same basic 
principles of a democratic nationalities policy are being 
applied in their regard, to wit: 
  -- national parity with other peoples on the territory of 
all 
components of the Federation, and in particular equality in the 
use of one's mother tongue in official relations and in social 
and cultural life; 
  -- the right to ethnocultural self-organization; for 
example, 
by setting up regional-cultural associations on territories 
where Russians are in the minority; 
  -- state support for programs for the revival of the 
regional 
diversity of Russian national culture and, of course, for 
Russian settlers. The state will strive to accept all migrant 
fellow countrymen and to give priority help in accommodating and 
finding job placements for socially unprotected groups of 
migrants and also for those of them who are headed for regions 
whose development is of special significance for the country. 
  In Russia the Federal authorities have displayed sufficient 
reserve and prudence which have made it possible to avoid a 
situation whereby constitutional conflicts with a number of 
republics might develop into interethnic confrontation. The 
organs of state power have still to devise a concept of state 
policy for Russia for averting and settling interethnic 
conflicts. It must be based on the principle of the primacy of 
peaceful political means of resolving contradictions that crop 
up. At the same time the state is obliged to use all legitimate 
means, including force, to immediately localize armed clashes, 
to disarm illegal military formations, and to nip in the bud the 
activities of organizations and persons preaching ethnic strife 
and calling for violence. 
  On the whole the policy of interethnic accord must occupy 
one 
of the leading places in the state strategy for the development 
of the Russian Federation. In order to implement this policy 
the following package of draft laws needs to be elaborated: 
  -- on national minorities; 
  -- on the status of national councils, rayons, okrugs, and 
settlements and on national-cultural autonomy; 
  -- on the development of ethnic cultures and languages; 
  -- on forced migration and refugees from zones of 
interethnic 
conflicts. 
<H5>  4. Toward A Social State Through Market Reform. </H5>
<H6>  4.1. Reform Reserves </H6>
  The economy of the transition period is always unstable. If 
a state is weak, instability grows, reform grinds to a halt, and 
economic activity is destroyed. In a strong state, 
stabilization is achieved more quickly, and reform creates the 
preconditions for economic revival. Unless the state is 
strengthened, Russia will find it impossible to overcome the 
crisis and implement a profound reform of the economy. 
  Right now, the situation in the economy is highly alarming. 
Mutual nonpayments are bringing enterprises to a halt. Prices 
continue to rise. In January 1994 the rate of inflation rose 
again to hit 22 percent. People have not been paid for months. 
Social tension remains high. 
  In August 1993 the government adopted an action program, 
which it is trying to carry out. The authorities of many 
regions, now in possession of sufficient freedom to effect 
market transformations in which millions of people are taking 
part, are taking vigorous action. However, the economic 
situation is not improving. An analysis of what is happening is 
required. 
  Real economic reform in Russia was inevitable. Any deviation 
from the strategy of reform will place the country on the brink 
of catastrophe. The state's political line must be 
single-minded: There will be no turning back. 
  The reform is intended to transform the economic mechanism 
in 
a radical manner, to render it efficient, and to make it work to 
people's advantage. Now, two years on from its beginning, it is 
possible to sum up the results, to compare the gains and the 
losses, and to define the reserves. 
  The reform can be credited with the dismantling of the basic 
elements of an outmoded administrative system, and the switch to 
economic methods of regulation. The first stage of 
privatization, without which reform would have been impossible, 
is drawing to a close. Within a short space of time private 
ownership, almost wholly eradicated in past decades, has once 
again became a reality. 
  There is evidence of changes in the economic psychology, the 
gradual adjustment of producers and consumers to market 
conditions. Economic activity, prices, and foreign trade have 
been liberalized. Business activity is moving from the state to 
the nonstate sector. A consumer market has started to function. 
  Russia has a sizable foreign trade surplus. For the first 
time in many years grain imports have dropped significantly. 
There has been success in achieving the domestic convertibility 
of the ruble for current transactions, and in creating specific 
currency reserves allowing us to maintain vital imports and the 
minimum required payments against the foreign debt. Gradually, 
Russia is becoming integrated into the world economy. 
  The results observed are considerable if compared with the 
situation on the eve of reform. They have been achieved 
primarily through the efforts of the millions of people who have 
accepted reform. Despite all the difficulties of the first 
years of market reforms, people do not want to return to the old 
ways. 
  The results are modest if you think of what might have been, 
given normal political conditions and without major errors on 
the part of the authorities. 
  The reform of the economic mechanism is far from over. Its 
reserves are significant, and they must be utilized in full in 
1994: 
  -- the institutions of a market economy; 
  -- a system of state management; 
  -- demonopolization; 
  -- taxation; 
  -- economic legislation. 
  Upon completion of the check stage of privatization, a 
qualitatively new stage of this process will begin. An increase 
in investment activity, a weighty contribution to the structural 
overhaul, the creation of a competitive milieu, and the 
formation of a full-fledged stock market will become the central 
problems. 
  Although Russia already has the bases of a market economy 
infrastructure, this infrastructure is distributed highly 
unevenly. In particular, the country does not have effective 
institutions guaranteeing the operation of markets for 
equipment, land, accommodations and other immovable assets, 
securities, and wholesale trade. The Federal Government and the 
regional authorities have no right to be indifferent to this. 
What is more, the institutional aspect of the reform must 
become the vanguard. 
  The Federal Assembly will be acting correctly if it lays a 
firm legal base for Russian enterprise. The main thing is that 
it should be stable. The bodies of state power need to simplify 
considerably the procedures regulating private business 
activity. The complexity and inconsistency of regulation hinders 
the development of enterprise and nurtures corruption. 
Preferential state support is required by those entrepreneurial 
structures which are operating in priority areas of the reform. 
The Federal Program of State Support for Small Enterprise is to 
guarantee this in 1994. 
  The most pressing tasks for 1994 include the formation of a 
modern system of accounting and the start of the far-reaching 
reform of the Central Bank with the aim of creating a Russian 
Federal Reserve System. Given that the actions of the Central 
Bank have key significance for the fate of the reform and wide 
sociopolitical consequences, the process of reforming it will be 
under the president's control. 
  The year 1994 must become the year of the formation of 
Russian financial-industrial groups. It is for the government 
to monitor that they are set up on a strictly voluntary basis, 
and to guard against the resurrection of the old ministerial 
structures, the misappropriation of state property, and 
unjustified monopoly. Such institutions are capable of 
maintaining a sufficient level of investment activity and 
technological innovations, and of ensuring the concentration of 
resources in areas of growth and the necessary competitiveness 
both on the domestic Russian market and on the world market. 
  The alternative is only too clear: The rapid suffocation of 
Russian entrepreneurial structures by the foreign 
multinationals, with the exception, perhaps, of those operating 
in the raw material sector. It is necessary to set in place 
without delay institutions guaranteeing the implementation of 
state structural policy. 
  In the agrarian sector it is time for the government and the 
regional authorities to set up mechanisms to realize the right 
of private land ownership, and to help construct a modern 
banking infrastructure. A rational protectionist policy is 
required, protecting the interests of national producers but 
without perceptible damage to consumers. 
  In 1994 it is necessary to begin a radical alteration of the 
entire system of state support for the agrarian sector. This 
does not mean meeting any financial requests from the sector, 
but instead a real reform of its economic mechanism -- this must 
be the main principle. 
  The state has as yet failed to bring about the effective 
regulation of the economy, in particular the management of 
enterprises belonging to it. 
  Owing to this, many enterprises to this day do not bear full 
liability for the results of their activity, hoping to get 
support from the budget even in the event of continuing with 
clearly inefficient production. Everybody knows where this kind 
of support leads -- to new spirals of inflation, the slowing of 
the structural overhaul, and a drop in economic efficiency. It 
is precisely for this reason that reform is not progressing as 
quickly as it might at the level of state enterprises. 
  In place of the old links of the administrative system, new 
administrative structures have emerged and strengthened, many of 
which are by no means obligatory in market conditions. Although 
a bureaucrat no longer doles out plans and allocates funds, he 
is no less powerful insofar as he distributes centralized 
credits and investments, allocates export quotas, and issues 
licenses. As a consequence of this, not only is management 
efficiency lost but the economic base of corruption is 
reproduced. 
  The government has been unable to impose the requisite 
order here. The de facto nonownership of property and the 
management "vacuum" in the state sector must be eradicated in 
1994. Serious changes in legislation are overdue: the norms 
prescribed for an economy of centralized planning and economic 
accountability are now inappropriate. The state's attitude 
toward its own enterprises must be that of a proprietor. This 
will stop the squandering of state property to the advantage of 
the mercenary interests of certain economic managers, increase 
the efficiency of its utilization, and, by shedding nonviable 
production facilities, maintain the viable ones. 
  The creation of a regulatory system for the market econmy is 
not a retreat but a move forward, a development of the reform, a 
strengthening of the Russian state. In a badly managed economy 
there will never be true market-based order. 
  As before, its formation is hindered by loss-making 
monopolism. So deeply have monopoly structures taken root in the 
Russian economy that demonopolization will take some 
considerable time. The task in the coming years is to reform the 
monopolized economy -- this circumstance has to be taken fully 
into account. 
  In order to make rational use of the antimonopoly reserve of 
the reform it is necessary to broaden the appropriate 
legislation and to demand greater accountability from the state 
bodies implementing it. The formation of a competitive medium 
will be aided by measures stimulating private enterprise and the 
formation of multiprofile companies, and by a well-balanced 
foreign trade policy protecting the economic interests of 
Russia, not by inefficient monopolist formations. 
  The effective transformation of the tax system will help 
economic reform along considerably. It should be clear and 
stable, at least, for the duration a year. The number of taxes 
should be reduced, and the procedure for levying them should be 
considerably simplified. The changes to the taxation system 
must support the producers, particularly those working in the 
consumer market; they should also stimulate investment and prove 
highly effective for the economy as a whole. 
  We should also think hard about bringing into play 
mechanisms 
that will make it impossible and disadvantageous to evade taxes. 
Massive attempts to conceal income from taxation are more 
intolerable. In the final analysis we must learn to collect 
everything that is due to the state. The budget will feel the 
benefits of such a policy immediately, and the budget deficit 
problem will become less acute. This is especially important 
inasmuch as it is becoming ever more difficult to resolve this 
problem by cutting expenditure. 
  The government should put forward legislative initiatives 
that envisage shifting the center of gravity onto taxation of 
natural resources and real estate. We need to tighten up 
financial penalties for those who pollute the environment, 
without, however, undermining the competitiveness of Russian 
output on the world market. The substantial consolidation of 
tax breaks for capital investment and innovative activity is in 
the interests of production. 
  We urgently need to make a breakthrough in the sphere of 
legal backup for market reform. Economic legislation lacks 
unity. Hitherto it has proved impossible to fully regulate legal 
relationships between the Federal Government and the regional 
authorities. The competence of state bodies at one level has 
not been demarcated. 
  Draft laws slated for submission to the Russian president 
and 
State Duma in 1994 include the RF Civil Code, which includes a 
general and a specific section. Its adoption would create an 
all-embracing legal basis for a market economy, a society of 
civilized property owners, economic freedom for the individual, 
and partnership relations between the citizen and the state. 
The Civil Code embodies new principles of entrepreneurship, 
relationships between economic players, and other key reform 
issues. 
  Draft codes on housing, labor law, joint-stock company law, 
and contractual partnership are being prepared. The same goes 
for taxation and agrarian legislation, and for changes and 
supplements to laws on bankruptcy, competition, limitations on 
monopoly activity, and the peasant (private farmer) economy. Of 
extreme importance are legislative acts regulating the 
circulation of securities, foreign investment, concessions, and 
the functioning of free economic zones. A new law on the 
banking system is also needed. 
<H6>  4.2. The Price of Reform and Ways of Reducing It </H6>
  Economic reform is not painless and free of charge. Losses 
are inevitable, and the central political problem is to ensure 
that the cost of market transformations is not too great for 
society. We have not managed to achieve this. 
  The high cost of reform is explained, first, by the 
unfavorable starting position. At the end of 1991 the economy 
was in an extremely grave state. The effective abandonment of 
the totalitarian system's mechanism coincided with the USSR's 
disintegration and the severing of economic ties. The consumer 
market was devastated even earlier, foreign currency reserves 
were exhausted. The production slump deepened. The ruble was 
washed out of circulation and barter flourished. By postponing 
necessary reforms for decades the totalitarian regime 
exacerbated all problems to the utmost and exhausted the 
national economy's durability margin. 
  Russia inherited from the past a cumbersome production 
structure dominated by the military-industrial complex and 
monopolism, and exports geared to raw materials. 
  Inflation began much earlier than 1992. This disease ravaged 
our economy for many years, taking the form of a universal 
commodity shortage, distribution by ration coupon, and waiting 
lines kilometers long. When price liberalization was launched, 
inflationary energy that had been pent up for years burst out. 
  Second, the price of reform is determined by political 
circumstances. Two years of reform in Russia were accompanied 
by a most acute confrontation between the branches of federal 
power during which they weakened each other, and that means the 
state as a whole. The transfer of the struggle to the sphere of 
economic policy had very grave consequences for the country and 
especially for reform: weak legislative support for market 
transformations, delays in reform, accelerated inflation -- this 
is by no means a full list. 
  Third, the downside of the reform was attributable to 
mistakes by the bodies of state power responsible for reform. 
The government took poor account of the consequences of some 
decisions, postponed the adoption of others, was slow to make 
considreed corrections to reform, and underused the reform's 
reserves. This was especially noticeable in recent months, when 
the government not so much advanced the reform as reacted to the 
problems arising. The pause in reformation became protracted. 
It is time to end it. 
  The experience of the past two years shows that it is not 
only the reform itself that is turning into the well-known 
losses. Even greater harm is being done by delaying overdue 
amendments to the structure of the economic mechanism. 
  One of the main ingredients of the cost of Russian reform is 
persistently high inflation, the endless rise in prices. This 
is inflicting enormous damage on the reform itself, the 
poulation's quality of life, and the economy as a whole. In 
conditions of unrestrained inflation the crisis is 
insurmountable. 
  The capital investment situation remains extremely grave. 
The basis of the investment crisis is high inflation, as a 
result of which money is going not into production but into 
brokerage. There is practically no more budget investment, 
there is still no share market -- such is the inevitable 
combination of the transition period, the negative consequences 
of which for investment are perfectly clear. Because of 
inflation credit has become not only expensive but also 
primarily short-term. Consequently the future of Russia's 
economy is under threat. 
  The inertia of the economic slump persists. In a number of 
sectors the real degradation and destruction of production is 
under way, with a fall in output in 1993 by 25 percent and more. 
  High-technology machine building is in a very difficult 
situation. Some plants are surviving only by switching to 
production of technologically obsolete equipment, slipping to 
the level of the sixties. Although we are producing less than 
before, consumption of raw materials, fuel, and energy remains 
considerable. Efficiency is falling. The reality of the 
transitional period is that Russian industry could become a 
market industry, but one that is primitive and inefficient. 
Such a payment for market reform would be inordinately high. 
  In two years of reform the government has simply been unable 
to elaborate an effective structural policy. This inaction will 
cost the Russian economy dear. 
  Production is being greatly harmed by the crisis of mutual 
nonpayments. Not only the economy but also the social sphere is 
suffering, because hidden unemployment is increasing, wages are 
not being paid on time, and local budgets are failing to collect 
a considerable proportion of taxes. If we delay a solution to 
the problem, massive nonpayments will continue to promote the 
closure of enterprises and intensify the production slump. 
  The social cost of reform proved to be very great indeed. On 
the one hand the reforms cannot be allowed to founder, which 
will merely intensify the difficulties being experienced by the 
people. On the other hand the threshold of social shock must not 
be exceeded. Otherwise the population's willingness to support 
market reform will come into sharp conflict with the fear of 
being crushed by it. The greatest fears are caused by poverty, 
glaring inequality, and unemployment. 
  The country is suffering losses because of weak control over 
the export of resources and unfavorable foreign trade 
conditions. The general economic instability and deficiencies 
in foreign currency control are having the effect of leaving a 
considerable proportion of export earnings sitting in Russian 
enterprise accounts abroad. The state is obliged to reliably 
protect national interests. Otherwise citizens' confidence in 
any of its actions, including reformatory actions, is undermined. 
  The cost of reform has proved to be high. The trajectory was 
correct but the flight was accompanied by serious mistakes. Not 
only the Russian economic mechanism remained largely 
expenditure-driven. Likewise the political mechanism. 
  The failings of the reform and its reserves are clear. The 
most important task now is to make market transformations less 
onerous for society without reducing the pace of reform -- and 
even increasing it. 
  Despite the fact that the rate of price increases is high, 
there are possibilities of restraining inflation. A monthly 
inflation level of 3-5 percent by the end of 1994 specified in 
the Government Program should serve as a guideline. If it is 
possible to reach this line and sustain it and make price 
dynamics predictable, according to current Russian standards 
such inflation could be considered acceptable. 
  The aim is achievable only given joint constructive work 
between the Federal Assembly and government. Other 
prerequisites are: coordinated actions between the Finance 
Ministry and Central Bank in the sphere of credit policy, 
scrapping wasteful subsidies and support for unprofitable 
production facilities, cutting the budget deficit and setting 
its maximum size every quarter, swiching to deficit financing by 
placing the state's debt commitments in domestic and foreign 
financial institutions, and only granting credits to CIS 
countries which are secured on property and other assets. 
  The slowing of the rise in prices will be assisted by a 
considered pricing policy in those sectors where monopolism is a 
natural characteristic and is attributable to the specific 
features of production, for example in electric power 
engineering and railroad transport. 
  The prices race cannot be halted without a consistently 
anti-inflationary monetary and financial policy. But the 
government must also use other anti-inflationary levers, 
specifically any reserves in structural investment and taxation 
policies, and the mechanisms of social partnership. 
  Any economic policy actions of the federal authorities must 
be tested for inflation safety. The maximum permissible level 
of inflation must not be exceeded. This requirement must be 
strictly observed. Otherwise intervention from the president 
right up to the use of his constitutional powers cannot be ruled 
out. 
  The government will not find it easy to fulfill this 
requirement. Especially now, when it is faced with clearing 
debts to the defense sector, the agro-industrial complex, and 
budget-funded institutions, and repay debts to northerners. But 
if the government requires others to observe financial 
discipline then it must start doing so itself. Commitments 
assumed must be met. And greater responsibility must be shown 
in the future. 
  Another serious problem is the setting in motion of 
mechanisms which make it possible to overcome the nonpayments 
crisis and to stop the closure of viable enterprises. It cannot 
be ruled out that, relying on the law, it will be necessary to 
take tough administrative measures against leaders of state 
enterprises who, while having funds available in accounts, 
refuse to pay suppliers and demand money from federal 
authorities. The nonpayments crisis is taking on a political 
hue and is becoming a threat to the country's national security. 
The president's actions will be commensurate with the situation. 
  The lack of real action by the government and Central Bank 
on 
the problem of enterprises' mutual indebtedness is more 
inadmissible. We must introduce the elaborated scheme for 
clearing the state's debts to commodity producers and implement 
other planned measures. Let us hope they operate effectively 
and help break the chain of mutual nonpayments without fueling 
inflation. In 1994 we must start to register debts in the form 
of securities, to reorganize and revitalize economically 
insolvent enterprises, and in some cases to apply the bankruptcy 
procedure. This is especially necessary because, the government 
believes, the stabilization of the investment process can be 
expected this year. 
  It is essential to halt the technological regression of 
Russian industry, to prevent this process becoming irreversible, 
above all in sectors which are highly competitive in the world 
market -- the aerospace, laser, and atomic industries, 
shipbuilding, space services, and those devising software 
programs. The government should clariy the prospects for the 
defense order and meet the financial commitments it has assumed 
without delay. The carefully conceived conversion of the 
defense complex is no less important. There are also other 
priorities, which are contained in the Government Program 
adopted 6 August 1993. 
  If market forces alone are relied on, the solution of 
structural problems will be something for the distant future, an 
extremely expensive process associated with considerable 
expenditure on restoring what has been lost. An effective 
structural policy will help to reduce the costs of reform. The 
government must establish a uniform procedure for the granting 
of state support and strict control over how it is used. The 
distribution of centralized investment resources should be 
carried out on a competitive basis. The distribution of benefits 
on an individual basis must be kept to a minimum and regulated. 
This applies to both industry and agriculture. 
  Under the Constitution, Russia is a social state. Therefore 
Russian citizens must be confident that the legislative and 
executive branches will exercise control of the observance of 
the individual's basic social rights. I am referring to the 
length of the working day, a guaranteed minimum income, the 
situation of the unemployed, protection for mothers and 
children, prohibiting the use of child labor, housing provision, 
the right to a vacation, etc. What is needed is a firm 
legislative base which specifies the state's duties and 
responsibility to citizens and the mechanisms for their 
implementation. 
  Ensuring the requisite level of social protection will 
become an immutable requirement made of government economic 
policy. Only a state program which does not cause an 
intolerable reduction in basic social indicators must be adopted 
for implementation. If the government is incapable of ensuring 
compliance with the social rights of citizens enshrined in the 
Constitution, it means it is not working skillfully enough. The 
population's legitimate interests will be protected by the 
authority given to the president by the Constitution. 
  The state's efforts should be concentrated on the following 
main areas. 
  -- stabilization of the population's living standard; 
  -- broadening of incentives for labor and entrepreneurial 
activity by economically active citizens; 
  -- targeted support for the least protected social strata; 
  -- a more equal sharing of the burden of the economic crisis 
among various groups of the population. 
  It must be recognized that there is an urgent need for a 
package of documents relating to the social protection of the 
population, which will be based on the Law on the Subsistence 
Minimum and other enactments of the Federal Assembly. Every 
citizen of Russia must be ensured the necessary minimum level of 
goods and services. And this should form the basis for 
determining the level of the minimum wage, pensions, grants, and 
allowances. A unified system of social guarantees will thereby 
be built. 
  Support for the needy, an effective income tax, and actions 
by the state to speed up the structural improvement 
[strukturizatsiya] of the consumer market, a review of 
concessions for certain enterprises and regions, and, needless 
to say, a reduction in inflation will be needed to reduce 
unwarranted differences in real incomes. 
  Comprehensive reform of the system of social services is 
needed, making provision for social guarantees for the needy, 
along with the introduction of charges [platnost]. A switch to 
a two-tier system of pension provision is needed, whereby state 
pensions will be supplemented with payments from citizens' 
individual accounts in pension funds accumulating personal 
savings. 
  It is necessary to create financial reserves in good time, 
using them to fully provision federal, regional, and other 
employment funds. The proper amount of unemployment benefit and 
other payments linked with the loss of jobs must be issued, and 
without delay. In 1994 employment policy will have to be 
considerably stepped up. Urgent economic measures may also be 
necessary in areas where the level of unemployment exceeds 
socially tolerable limits. 
  The government must continue to provide gradual compensation 
for private savings wiped out by price liberalization. 
Mechanisms are needed to curb and delay the effects of 
inflation. The task must be performed not just because in early 
1992 most holders of savings did not have the slightest chance 
of rescuing them from depreciation. The problem goes deeper 
than that, affecting the authorities' prestige and the degree of 
government and parliamentary responsibility for their 
predecessors' social pledges. 
  The state and society cannot do without social partnership 
institutions which enable tasks to be performed on a national 
scale. This may include, for instance, the regular coordination 
of the positions of the government, entrepreneurs, and trade 
unions within the framework of a tripartite commission. 
  The federal unification of foreign trade procedures, the 
abolition of unwarranted concessions for regions, sectors, and 
certain enterprises, and a move to the sale by tender of export 
quotas will help reduce the cost of reform. It is necessary to 
continue the policy of liberalizing exports as well as 
tightening up state control of exports of strategically 
important raw material and energy resources. A targeted state 
program providing incentives for science-intensive commercial 
exports will be needed. 
  The government must step up currency control. Tough 
penalties are needed for offenders who illegally stash hard 
currency resources abroad. At the same time private holders of 
hard currency must be given state guarantees to protect them 
against having these assets confiscated or frozen. 
  Russia will escape from the crisis and continue reform 
autonomously and develop economic relations with other states 
and international financial organizations on the basis of 
equality and national interests. The Federal Assembly and the 
government have much to do to ensure that investment in the 
Russian economy becomes more appealing to foreign firms. At the 
same time it is clear that the latter will refrain from major 
investment until stabilization is established and until Russian 
entrepreneurs start investing capital in the Russian economy. 
The Russian state must consistently uphold the interests of 
Russian companies on the domestic and world markets. 
  Thus, in present conditions economic policy must be 
structured in such a way as to ensure that two strategic 
objectives are met, to whit: 
  -- continuing reform and changing the actual structure of 
the 
economic system; 
  -- reducing the cost of reform, i.e. combating inflation, 
structural crisis, poverty, unjust inequality, and enforced 
unemployment. 
  In 1994 there will be tough sociopolitical restrictions and 
little freedom for maneuver. It is all the more necessary for 
the state bodies responsible for economic policy to pool their 
efforts. These must be concentrated on the main task -- the 
reform of the economic mechanism. 
  Reform will gain a second wind if we energetically implement 
urgent institutional transformations, start a qualitatively new 
phase of privatization, lay the foundations for an effective 
system of state regulation, use the available reserves of 
demonopolization, reform taxation, adopt vitally necessary 
legislative acts, and provide the mechanisms for their 
implementation. It will then be possible with the help of a 
well-considered economic policy to steer the Russian economy 
between hyperinflation and a drastic decline in production, 
avoiding both, and render market transformations less 
cost-based. There is no other way to restore the economy than by 
continuing reform. 
  Russian state bodies must do everything to ensure that 1994 
is the year that sees the rate of inflation gradually drop, the 
fall in production diminish and come to a halt, vigorous 
structural transformations based on the removal of inefficient 
production units and support for points of growth, and the 
stabilization of living standards for the bulk of the 
population. This year the preconditions may be created not only 
for economic stabilization but also for the start of steady 
economic growth. 
  Only a professional and responsible Federal Assembly and 
government can do this. That is precisely what the country 
expects of them. 
<H5>  5. From a Monopoly Ideology to Cultural Diversity </H5>
<H6>  5.1 Development of Culture, Science, and Education </H6>
  Russia's wealth lies in its unique spiritual and 
intellectual 
potential. At the most difficult points in our history, our 
inexhaustible reserve of spiritual strength has saved our 
country and allowed it to withstand and overcome inconceivable 
obstacles. 
  But today problems in the cultural sphere are being felt 
more 
and more keenly. The totalitarian state ideology, whose 
mouthpiece was the CPSU and which held sway for decades, has 
collapsed. 
  It has been replaced by the realization of a natural 
historical and cultural continuity; an understanding of the 
realities of the modern world and Russia's place in it; the 
value of the individual and his dignity; an effort to bring the 
state into line with human nature; and the restoration of 
natural proportion with regard to society and the individual. 
But these improvements signaling a return to spiritual health 
have still not been transformed into a system of social and 
cultural standards. 
  The result of all this is that there has been a loss of 
moral 
reference points. This is manifested in: 
  -- a loss of interest in questions of principle concerning 
our life in society overall, and in particular among the 
intelligentsia; 
  -- an undermining of people's moral foundations, a 
dehumanization of life and culture, and an increase in extremism 
in literally all spheres of social activity -- from economics to 
culture; 
  -- the destruction of a core world view, a readiness to 
believe in any random illusion, any speculative idea, and at the 
same time in nihilism and absolute nonbelief. 
  All these trends are alarming, and the Russian State's main 
task is to overcome them. If this is not done it will not be 
possible to regenerate the country or the Russian people's 
dignity. 
  It is time to recognize that culture cannot survive without 
the state's taking an active part in its future. During the 
whole of Russia's thousand-year history, culture and people 
working in the cultural sphere have not enjoyed so much creative 
freedom and political independence as today. But it is at this 
very moment that the problems of the "country becoming 
culturally impoverished," the "destruction of talent," and 
poverty among writers, artists, scientists, and museum and 
library staffs have reared their ugly heads. Creative people 
are becoming hostages to commercialization. Culture and art are 
beginning to lose their old role in public life. 
  The vital issue for 1994 is the establishment of the best 
possible relations between the state and culture. The extreme 
positions which should be avoided at all costs are well known: 
  -- freedom in itself is no guarantee whatsoever of 
flourishing creative activity; 
  -- if cultural activities are even in part maintained under 
duress, they will sooner or later grind to a halt. Creativity 
and coercion are incompatible. No directives coming from above 
will genuinely be able to improve culture. 
  Russia has a vital need for a national cultural policy. It 
is not a question of the relevant ministry or ministries having 
a program of measures or of the Federation components having a 
certain set of plans of action for culture. Cultural diversity 
never fitted into any framework laid down by government 
departments or into the administrative-territorial organization 
of the country's activities. 
  The state should propose federal programs for preserving and 
developing national culture and stimulating its diversity. 
  Our opportunities are limited in the context of the economic 
crisis. But the budgetary obligations which the state is taking 
on should be carried out. Society should know what proportion 
of the budget will be spent on culture, science, education, and 
public health. 
  One task for the future is to go over in practice to a 
multichannel system of financing culture. The federal and 
regional authorities and the organs of local self-government 
should bear its costs. Charity may provide significant backing 
for culture, especially if the government is finally able to 
stimulate this by tax incentives. A law on charitable funds and 
charitable activities is necessary for this. 
  Our immediate tasks include developing a legal base for 
culture, in particular providing a legislative definition of the 
legal status of cultural organizations. And preparing a draft 
law on noncommercial organizations. Its adoption will permit us 
to put the resolution of many acute social and cultural problems 
on a strict legal basis. 
  In the context of privatization and the transition to new 
land relations, a task for the authorities at all levels is the 
conservation of historical and cultural monuments, historical 
complexes, reserves, archives, museums, and libraries. The 
cultural heritage is a special kind of state property which 
requires special regulation. 
  It is necessary to elaborate and adopt laws protecting the 
cultural heritage of the Russian Federation's peoples and 
museums and their collections and to take the specific nature of 
culture into consideration in general laws. This affects first 
and foremost tax legislation, in which it is necessary to switch 
to a comprehensive system for supporting culture, people 
involved in culture, and their professional associations. 
  It is necessary to make appropriate changes to the Criminal 
Code, the Code of Penal Procedure, and the Code of 
Administrative Violations, making provision for stiffer 
penalties for crime against the country's cultural heritage. 
  Strengthening Russia's statehood is inconceivable without 
science's development, the sense of which is absolutely clear 
now: There has to be a natural integration of science and the 
new market conditions. 
  It is a question of creating the conditions for introducing 
academic developmental work of an applied nature, of carrying 
out various types of scientific and scientific-technical work 
and services to help execute major projects. 
  It is essential in 1994 to pay particular attention to the 
fate of the so-called science cities like Arzamas-16. Having at 
their disposal a unique scientific and technical potential, they 
can become centers for generating new knowledge, technology, and 
modern education, conduits for innovative technology to all 
areas of the national economy, a basis for developing state 
scientific centers and the conversion of industrial plants. 
  The Russian Federation's system of scientific research 
institutes was created over many years through the work and 
talent of many generations of Russians and as a whole is very 
advanced. In a number of areas of knowledge, particularly 
technology, our science is falling behind world standards, but 
to a much smaller degree than in other spheres (agriculture and 
industry). 
  However, changes are required in the forms of scientific 
management which developed in the context of the unitary state. 
They cannot be transferred to market conditions in their 
previous form. The basic aim of all restructuring in science is 
to create favorable conditions for the creative activities of 
primary scientific collectives -- not of institutions and 
departments -- and for free competition among different schools 
and tendencies. 
  The scientific-technical revolution resulted in a serious 
overrating of the relative values of the material and 
intellectual components of the national wealth. It is 
intellect, represented among other things by the high technology 
of the technotron age, which is a decisive source of rapid 
industrial and agricultural growth. Without the development of 
fundamental scientific research as a matter of priority, this 
decisive source will dry up or will become less active. 
  Fundamental theoretical research in the fields of 
philosophy, 
history, sociology, psychology, and law is needed to bring the 
humanities side of our culture up to a level worthy of the best 
traditions of Russian thought in the humanities and, in the 
present crucial period in Russia's development, to create a 
spiritual and intellectual basis for social change. 
  The state must continue with the budget financing of 
fundamental research and fundamentally new technologies. 
Permanent state support for the universally recognized 
fundamental scientific research center -- the Russian Academy of 
Sciences (understood as a system of scientific institutes) -- is 
also required. 
  It is important to adopt a law on science and 
scientific-technical policy. It is also necessary to elaborate 
legal measures which would make it possible to expand the inflow 
of funds from republic and other regional budgets for the 
financing of projects being carried out in the interests of 
republics and regions. 
  Legislative acts on scientific research organization, on 
scientific and technical expertise, and a number of other topics 
must also be prepared. 
  A regime of full public information is necessary in terms of 
the volumes and deadlines for the allocation and distribution of 
state budget funds at all levels, and also full and open 
accountability for all expenditure. Budget financing should be 
supplemented by competitive financing, which, in the face of a 
deficit of resources, will promise the most effective use of 
funds. 
  While not underestimating the significance of broad 
international cooperation, all the necessary conditions 
(earnings, equipment, libraries) must be created for our 
scientists to be able to work efficiently in their own homeland. 
  The situation in colleges and universities is no less 
difficult. Young teachers are leaving Russian institutes of 
higher education, the prestige of this profession is falling, 
and the socioeconomic position of scientific-pedagogical and 
research cadres has deteriorated sharply. 
  Resolute steps to ensure more effective use of both the 
educational and the scientific potential of colleges and 
universities must be taken in 1994-1995 and not put off until 
the future, and the existing forms, as well as the integration 
of science and higher education, must be expanded. This applies 
to fundamentally new forms of mutual relations between science 
and institutes of higher education -- the creation of scientific 
education complexes and the preparation of joint scientific 
programs, projects, and text books for schools and institutes of 
higher education. 
  The Russian higher education system must be given greater 
stability. Regional scientific educational programs must be 
funded on an equal basis from the state budget and territorial 
budgets. The active participation of local budgets in resolving 
questions of the development of the material base and the social 
protection of students and workers in higher education is 
required. 
  Spiritual and intellectual perfection will not appear on its 
own. The reform of our society must presuppose the fundamental 
reform of the education system, starting with the aims of 
education, its economic foundation, and the running of the 
education system, and ending with the system of training and 
retraining specialists, the structure of schools, and the 
content and technology of education. 
  The development of a modern society urgently and 
increasingly 
requires independence of thought and the ability to make 
decisions. The modern mass school is not geared to forming 
these individual qualities. 
  Solving educational problems is impossible without improving 
the running of the education system. The following must be 
singled out especially: 
  -- the implementation of a federal program for the 
development of education; 
  -- the demarcation of the competence of educational 
administration bodies at various levels; 
  -- the transition to state-public forms of administration; 
  -- the use of flexible mechanisms of administration, 
envisaging the attestation of workers in education and 
educational institutions and the licensing of educational 
activity. 
  A very important step has already been taken -- the Law on 
Education has been adopted. This law has unfettered the school 
and de-ideologized it. But it is precisely in schools, more 
than in any other sector of industry, science, or culture, that 
we are not yet ready for freedom and creative work. 
  The centralized financing of the schools from the state 
budget has become an objective obstacle to their development. 
Obviously, even now some of the expenditure must be borne by 
the state budget. This primarily means capital construction. 
The other part should be covered by municipal funds. Russia 
does have experience of doing this. The practice must be 
revived in the law on local self-government. An enormous role 
in the funding of schools can be played by local educational 
funds and school boards of trustees if a sensible taxation 
concession system is drawn up. 
  Fundamental changes are also necessary in running the 
education system. So far this work has been carried out by the 
actual administration workers in their own interests. The 
overall number of administrative workers per student has 
increased continuously. The new education system must be geared 
to the child, a more comfortable life for him, and his optimum 
development. 
  Federal laws must be elaborated and adopted on: 
  -- high school education; 
  -- college and university education; 
  -- further professional education; 
  -- the privatization of state and municipal educational 
institutions. 
<H6>  5.2. Inter-Religion and Multiconfessional Dialogue in a 
Secular State </H6>
  Russia is a state with a variety of religions; dialogue 
among 
them is one of Russia's traditions. Russia's history shows us 
experience of this dialogue, conducted both by religious figures 
and through contacts among believers from different religious 
groups. 
  The experience of neighborly coexistence, mutual 
understanding, and mutual assistance among communities and 
spiritual centers of different religions and faiths is 
particularly important for us today. The experience of Russian 
state policy, developing as it does in a multiethnic, diverse 
religious environment, is equally important. 
  For over 70 years Russian society lived in conditions of 
effective state atheism. However, the age-old people's 
principles were not totally destroyed. The revival of interest 
in religion is a fact of modern life. Consideration of this 
factor in the activity of state bodies and the maintenance of 
interreligious peace in the country are an abiding value and a 
long-term task. 
  The actual rather than merely verbal renunciation of the 
policy of state atheism; religious dialogue; and proper 
relations between Russia's churches and religious associations 
is one of the conditions for civic peace and general 
conciliation in society. 
  The legislative and executive authorities must do everything 
to preclude the very possibility of ethnopolitical conflicts 
developing into interreligious conflicts especially since, 
strictly speaking, none of Russia's peoples is entirely uniform 
in religious terms. 
  State bodies at all levels must rigorously observe the 
adopted norms, which are designed to ensure genuine freedom of 
conscience in Russia, restore the justice with regard to 
Russia's churches and religious associations that was violated 
during the postrevolutionary period, and help normalize their 
traditional activity. At the same time it must be borne in mind 
that the church is separate from the state but not from society, 
with which it historically is closely interconnected. Special 
attention must be paid to the legal and property status of 
churches and religious associations, their centers, parishes, 
monasteries, spiritual education establishments, and other 
establishments. 
<H5>  6. Russia and Security in the World </H5>
<H6>  6.1. Military Security </H6>
  One of the most important aspects of strengthening the state 
system is to ensure the military security of the Russian 
Federation. 
  The RF Armed Forces and other troops are designed to: 
  -- defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity and other 
vital interests of the RF in the event of aggression against it 
or its allies; 
  -- suppress armed conflict threatening Russia's vital 
interests and any illegal armed violence within Russia, on its 
State Border, or on the borders of other states in accordance 
with treaty commitments; 
  -- conduct peacekeeping operations by decision of the UN 
Security Council or in accordance with the RF's international 
commitments. 
  In view of the changes in the geopolitical situation a 
tremendous amount of work has been carried out on the 
organizational development of the Armed Forces: Combat strength 
has been determined, new groups of troops (forces) have been 
created, mobile forces are being formed, strategic, operational, 
and mobilization planning for the use of the Armed Forces has 
been completed, and the number of fully manned, combat-ready 
units and combined formations has been increased. 
  As a result the RF Armed Forces are combat capable and by 
and 
large fulfill their assigned tasks. The main attention should 
subsequently be geared to military-legal reform, continued 
organizational development of the Armed Forces, and their 
in-depth reform. 
  The fundamental principles of legal support for the Russian 
Army have already been created; however, some of the provisions 
are not in force owing to the lack of a mechanism to implement 
them and the lack of sources of funding. Amendments and addenda 
must be made to military legislation. 
  Basic Provisions of Military Doctrine have been adopted for 
the first time in Russia's history as a normative-legal act, 
establishing the main guidelines for the development of the 
Armed Forces and other troops in the military-political, 
military, and military-technical spheres respectively. 
  The adopted military doctrine effectively represents the 
concept for military security -- an integral part of the unified 
concept for Russia's national security. Military organizational 
development must be conducted in strict accordance with the 
Basic Provisions of RF Military Doctrine. Around 20 new draft 
laws will also have to be prepared and examined. 
  On the basis of constitutional principles it is necessary to 
step up legal protection for Armed Forces servicemen and 
civilian personnel, military command and control organs, and 
troop units. 
  Effective interaction among the appropriate structures of 
the 
Federal Assembly, ministries, and departments must be ensured in 
the interests of implementing military-legal reform. 
  The formation of the Armed Forces in line with the new 
conditions must be completed in full in the period 1994-1995 and 
a base created for their in-depth transformation. 
  In view of the special features of the RF's geopolitical 
position, reform of the Armed Forces is based on the principle 
of mobile defense -- the creation of relatively small but 
relatively powerful forces, ready for immediate use in areas 
where a real threat to Russia's security arises. 
  The strategic nuclear forces will continue to be the main 
means of deterrence against war being unleashed. 
  Experimental-design work will be vigorously developed in 
military-technical policy, making it possible to provide a 
suitable response to existing and potential military threats and 
military-technical breakthroughs [proryvy]. The tasks of 
ensuring the country's nuclear security and equipping the Army 
and Navy with state-of-the-art combat command and control, 
communications, reconnaissance, and radioelectronic warfare 
systems are regarded as being of paramount importance. 
  The Program for Military Organizational Development is to be 
implemented in the immediate future. It is advisable to 
formulate and adopt a package of normative-legal acts defining 
the procedure for the implementation of military organizational 
development as a whole. 
  In 1994 the withdrawal of troops back to Russian territory 
is 
to be completed in the main. This task is being performed in a 
systematic manner, taking the real situation into consideration. 
The troop withdrawal is, however, still considerably 
outstripping the pace of structural development for servicemen. 
It is necessary to ensure the rigorous implementation of the 
State Housing Program for Servicemen and Their Families. The 
government is assigned the main supervisory and organizational 
functions here. 
  The planned reduction in manpower is being carried out. 
However, the manning problem remains one of the bottlenecks in 
military organizational development. It can only be resolved 
over the next few years by employing the mixed method of manning 
(by contract and draft). 
  The reorganization of and force reductions in the Armed 
Forces are making it possible to change the structure of the 
military budget considerably and confer on it a greater social 
thrust. 
  One of the most important tasks on the state scale is to 
ensure the prestige of service in Russia's Armed Forces. A 
person in military uniform must be perceived as the guarantor of 
security, stability, and order in the country. 
  Strengthening the Armed Forces is an important task for all 
branches of power. Its resolution will require people to rise 
above party bias and standpoint and unite all the wholesome 
forces in society. Nor can the components of the Federation 
remain aloof from this work. 
<H6>  6.2. Russia Within the System of International Relations </H6>
  The strengthening of the state system is an essential 
condition if Russia is to occupy a proper place within the 
system of changed international relations. 
  The generally recognized principles and norms of 
international law form the basis of our foreign policy course. 
Russia respects the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and 
independence of other states, including, naturally, those of our 
neighbors, and demands the same of them. Within the framework 
of these universal principles we will protect our legitimate 
interests and, if need be, will do so with firmness and 
toughness. Any self-respecting state does likewise, 
particularly when the protection of human rights and people's 
honor and dignity is involved. 
  The consistent promotion of national interests through 
openness and cooperation and the guaranteeing of favorable 
conditions for internal development and the continuation of 
reforms constitute the main goal of the Russian state's foreign 
policy in 1994. 
  By virtue of its potential and its geopolitical situation 
and 
influence Russia bears special responsibility for maintaining 
stability in the modern, multipolar world -- a complex and 
unpredictable world. Skillful work is needed in squaring 
competing interests and simultaneously promoting our own. 
  Global confrontation has disappeared into the past. For the 
first time in many years Russia has no military adversaries. 
The priorities in the sphere of our country's national security 
are eliminating centers of military conflict on Russia's 
borders, strengthening the arrangements governing the 
nonproliferation of mass destruction weapons and sophisticated 
military technologies, and enhancing control over the 
international arms trade while watching over Russia's commercial 
interests in this sphere. 
  The enactment of the START II Treaty and the Convention on 
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is on the agenda. The 
ratification of these documents by the Federal Assembly will 
mark a major stage in the implementation of Russia's new 
military doctrine, particularly as the Agreement between Russia, 
the United States, and Ukraine on the Complete Elimination of 
Strategic Nuclear Armaments on Ukrainian Territory has already 
been signed. 
  Relations with the new independent states on Russia's 
borders 
and the all-around development of the CIS are of paramount 
importance in foreign policy in 1994. This is a sphere of 
special responsibility and special mutual interest between 
Russia and its neighbors. Our country is bound up with them 
more closely than is usual with neighbors -- that is a reality 
which must be taken into account if we are to maintain control 
over economic and social processes and guarantee an acceptable 
level of security. 
  In the preceding period we managed to avoid two extremes -- 
imperial attempts to restore the Union state by force, with 
redrawing of the borders, or attempts by Russia to sidestep the 
problems of the former Union. Thanks to this no tragedy 
occurred on the nuclear superpower's territory. However, 
alongside the traditional opportunities which bind our contries 
by invisible threads in all spheres, new problems for Russia 
also lurk here. The centers of conflict close to its borders and 
the protracted crisis of the economy and indeed of the actual 
state system in a number of CIS countries do pose a serious 
threat to our country's security. 
  Practice shows that no one, apart from Russia, is ready 
today 
to assume the burden of peacemaking in the area of the former 
USSR. Nevertheless, the use of Russian peacemaking forces in CIS 
operations has hitherto been regarded with wariness in a number 
of countries. 
  It is essential that this be changed. In all CIS countries 
where Russia is involved in peacemaking operations it is doing 
so at the request and with the agreement of its neighbors, on 
the basis of international legal documents, and in full keeping 
with the sovereign rights of states as enshrined in the UN 
Charter. And that is why it does not need to ask the world 
community each time for authorization for a particular 
operation, although active UN and CSCE assistance in terms of 
personnel and finance would make peacemaking in the CIS more 
effective. 
  The year 1994 must see the start of practical 
implementation of the Treaty on Collective Security and the 
provision of backup for the activity of the CIS Collective 
Security Council. There is an urgent need to set up a Standing 
Consultative Commission on Peacemaking Activity in order to 
develop jointly with our partners practical forms and 
proccedures for cooperation in this sphere. 
  The Federal Assembly should soon examine the draft law on 
the 
participation of Russian military contingents in peacemaking 
operations, including operations within the CIS, CSCE, and UN 
frameworks. 
  Concern for Russians who have found themselves outside the 
bounds of the Russian Federation should invariably be at the 
focus of our attention in all spheres of relations between the 
CIS and the Baltic states. Wherever they live, our compatriots 
should feel themselves to be citizens who enjoy full and equal 
rights. 
  The interests of Russians in the CIS and the Baltic states 
will only be guaranteed if internationally recognized standards 
in the sphere of hunman rights and the rights of national 
minorities are observed throughout the territory of the former 
USSR. 
  A start has been made here. On Russia's initiative the 
Declaration on International Commitments in the Sphere of Human 
Rights and Basic Freedoms has been adopted in the CIS and a 
Commission on Human Rights has been established. 
  The next step is to secure the signing by Commonwealth 
states 
of the Convention on Guaranteeing the Rights of Persons 
Belonging to National, Ethnic, Lingustic, Cultural, and 
Religious Minorities and to submit the draft Commonwealth 
Convention on Human Rights to the Council of CIS Heads of 
States. Its adoption is a sine qua non for the start of 
practical work by the CIS Commission for Human Rights. 
  The elaboration of a Program for the Protection of the 
Interests and for the Support of Ethnic Russians Living Outside 
the Bounds of the Russian Federation is drawing close to 
completion. It is essential that the sources of finance and the 
mechanism for coordination at government level be clearly 
defined. 
  Russia is not entitled to reduce the level of its activity 
in 
the question of guaranteeing the rights of minorities in the CIS 
and Baltic states. Russian representatives should continue 
persistently to raise this problem before international 
institutions and seek their participation in the defense of 
their compatriots. It is also essential to develop such 
cooperation with the CSCE high commissioner for national 
minorities. 
  The formation of the CIS has been accompanied by a host of 
problems new and old. Nevertheless, a trend toward economic 
reintegration and deeper political cooperation has already 
emerged. 
  The organization of joint defense, the joint protection of 
borders, the creation of a single information area, and the 
comprehensive tackling of problems of citizenship and the 
protection of migrants' rights are questions which must figure 
at the center of our attention. 
  The economy is a particularly important sphere of 
cooperation 
between Russia and the newly independent states. The new 
mechanisms of economic collaboration are developing with 
difficulty and at a far slower pace than life requires. 
  There are many disputes over the problem of national 
currencies. The possibility of introducing a single monetary 
system with Russia is under study in a number of states. The 
most active proposals concerning the unification of monetary 
systems are currently coming from the government of the Republic 
of Belarus. 
  The unification of monetary systems is a highly complex 
process. A different level of prices has already taken shape in 
the new independent states. Marked differences in the methods 
of state management of the economy also exist. But all these 
problems can ultimately be resolved. The main difficulty is how 
to structure the management of the monetary system -- the actual 
circulatory system of the economy -- while retaining two 
governments, two national banks, two autonomous budgets, and two 
parliaments with equal and sovereign rights. Another important 
question is the following: What powers should a state entering 
into a unified monetary system with Russia on the basis of the 
Russian ruble voluntarily delegate in so doing; and will it not 
subsequently call for the revocation of those powers with damage 
to the other party? Finally, it is necessary to determine what 
level of political integration will guarantee the viability of 
the re-created unified monetary system. 
  It is clear that unification of the monetary systems could 
be very costly for our country. However, in the future 
unification could not just bring advantages to Belarus but could 
also cover Russia's costs and bring it its own rewards in 
conditions where new political approaches are employed. The 
president and government will seek these political solutions and 
approaches in close cooperation with the Federal Assembly. 
  Life goes on, and, regardless of the monetary basis on which 
settlements among neighboring states are structured, they should 
work toward a single economic area with observance of the 
principle of the free movement of goods, services, capital, and 
manpower. Special attention should be paid here to meeting the 
immediate needs of ordinary people: guaranteeing the 
unrestricted transfer of pensions and wages and the unrestricted 
exchange of currency when traveling. All these painful problems 
demand a well-considered but prompt solution. 
  The president of Russia has been elected chairman of the 
Council of CIS Heads of State for the next six months. This 
opportunity will be utilized to the full to make Russian 
initiatives and step up the work of forming the Economic Union 
-- the Commonwealth's common market. 
  The following items figure on the immediate agenda: 
  -- concluding an agreement creating a multilateral free 
trade 
zone and a customs union and an agreement forming a mechanism 
governing payment and settlement relations and a payments union; 
  -- ensuring the conditions necessary for the creation of the 
production and trade infrastructure of a common market 
(transnational associations and corporations, industrial and 
financial associations, brokerage firms, insurance companies, 
and joint banking structures); 
  -- preparing agreements providing for the solution of the 
most acute social problems, incuding those regulating the 
processes of migration, ensuring maximum freedom of movement of 
the population across the new borders, and providing joint 
measures for their social protection; 
  -- creating an Interstate Cooperation Committee in which 
Commonwealth member-states would vest a number of regulatory and 
control functions, particularly as regards the fulfillment of 
agreements. 
  In accordance with the decision of the Ashgabat meeting, 
Russia has proposed to the United Nations that the CIS be 
granted observer status as an international regional 
organization in the UN General Assembly. It is essential to 
speed up the preparation of proposals on permanent links between 
the CIS and the CSCE and other organizations. This will not 
only strengthen the Commonwealth's general authority in the 
world but will also enhance the quality of its collaboration 
with the world community in ensuring security and stability. 
  Strengthening the United Nations and adopting a model for 
reforming the organization which would transform it into the 
most reliable and all-embracing institution of international 
cooperation are priorities for Russia's multilateral diplomacy. 
  Partnership has become a key feature of Russia's relations 
with other states. The new nature of ties with the West opens 
up favorable opportunities for more effective realization of 
Russia's interests in the sphere of security, the economy, 
trade, and business. 
  Russia has joined the main international economic 
organizations. The next step is the energetic establishment of 
proper collaboration with them. 
  Since the G-7 meeting in Tokyo Russian diplomats and 
financiers have begun participating in conferences of its 
experts. A G-7 mission has been set up in Moscow. But an 
effective mechanism for consultation with the West, particularly 
as regards consideration of Russian interests, has not yet been 
set up. This is causing increasingly appreciable harm not just 
to Russia but to our partners too. 
  We have the opportunity today to achieve a qualitatively new 
level of cooperation between Russia and the G-7. The basic 
guidelines of the strategy of Russia's cooperation with the G-7 
-- in both the economic and foreign policy spheres -- could be 
confirmed at the meeting in Naples. This strategy should 
clearly delineate the long-term plan for turning the G-7 into a 
G-8, starting with the sphere of politics. 
  The elimination of COCOM this spring will be the final step 
in removing restrictions on Russian foreign trade links. The 
new international arrangements for controlling the trade in 
military and dual-purpose technology demands the direct 
involvement of Russia and the United States as major arms 
producers. 
  It is essential to make full use of the new opportunities 
for 
Russia-U.S. cooperation in the political, economic, scientific, 
technical, and other sectors. 
  Participation in building a greater Europe that is peaceful, 
unified, and democratic is one of Russia's main tasks in the 
European area. The next meeting of CSCE members in Budapest will 
be a landmark event in that direction. 
  Russia has proposed and will contine to uphold its concept 
of 
pan-European partnership. The CSCE is required to be the main 
instrument in the political building of the new Europe, while in 
the military-political sphere the North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council must play that role. It could coordinate the work of 
the regional organizations -- NATO, the WEU, and the CIS -- in 
maintaining peace and stability in the European area and 
ensuring greater openness in military activity and in the sphere 
of the conversion of the military-industrial complex. Other 
elements of the concept include granting the countries of 
Central Europe cross guarantees by Russia and its West European 
partners and expanding the North Atlantic Cooperation Council by 
including the neutral states of Europe. 
  Russia advocates a qualitative and quantitative approach to 
the problems of European security. We respect the sovereign 
right of states to enter into any alliances and the sovereign 
right of alliances to admit them. But our neighbors in Europe 
should also know our opinion: We are opposed to an expansion of 
NATO without Russia. On the basis of this principle, Russia 
supports the Partnership for Peace program as a means of 
pan-European partnership that is open to all states of the 
greater Europe. 
  The practical study of the parameters of the agreement with 
NATO must be speeded up so that we not only do not lag behind 
other countries but are out in front, especially in establishing 
cooperation in the military sphere. 
  Major bilateral documents have been signed with the majority 
of West European states. The task now is to fill the accords 
with the real content of practical collaboration while 
continuing regular top-level dialogue. It is essential to 
complete the preparation of the agreement on partnership and 
cooperation with the European Union. 
  Stepping up efforts to form new relations with the states of 
Central and East Europe is an important area of Russian military 
policy in 1994. Experience shows that common interests in 
carrying out democratic and market reforms and traditional links 
among our peoples outweigh old grievances. 
  Russia intends to continue to play one of the leading roles 
in seeking a settlement of the crisis in former Yugsolavia. The 
main thing here is to mobilize the political efforts of the 
world community to end the war in Bosnia and, as a first step, 
to consolidate safe areas, including in Sarajevo. In any event 
it must be clear that the Bosnian conflict cannot be resolved by 
selective support or punishment for one side or other. All 
sides must be persistently encouraged toward peace. The United 
Nations and its Security Council have a special role here. 
  Taking account of the FRY's fulfillment of the UN demands 
for 
a settlement of the Bosnia conflict, Russia will seek the 
dropping of the sanctions against that country. 
  Russia's mutual relations with the world are determined by 
its unique Eurasian status. In 1994 it is necessary to make use 
of the new opportunities for the development of cooperation with 
leading Asian states -- India, China, and Japan -- and with new 
partners -- South Korea and the ASEAN and Persian Gulf countries. 
  The current level of mutual relations with China and the 
transformation of that country into one of Russia's main trading 
partners makes it possible to set the task of moving our 
relations to the stage of constructive partnership on bilateral 
and international political issues. 
  Japan holds a special place in Far East politics. Russia 
intends to consistently work toward the conclusion of a peace 
treaty with that country on the basis of respect for each 
other's positions, the finding of mutually acceptable formulas, 
and the resolution of all contradictions, including on the 
territorial problem. This must happen with due consideration of 
Russian national interests and complete compliance with its 
Constitution, along the path of respect for and compliance with 
international law and commitments under international treaties. 
  An immediate task is to make maximum use of the untapped 
potential in our cooperation and interaction with Russia's 
reliable partner, India. 
  A central dimension of Russian policy in the Asia-Pacific 
region is the involvement of areas of Siberia and the Far East 
in international cooperation in the region. 
  The continuation of our country's active role as one of the 
organizers of the peace process in the Near East is intended to 
promote its long-term national interests and the strengthening 
of its international influence. 
  Relations with such promising regions as Latin America and 
Africa must be raised to a qualitatively new level. 
  In general a new and graphically expressed inner philosophy 
has emerged in foreign policy recently. Cooperation structures 
in the Baltic, Black Sea, and Euro-Arctic regions have been 
created with active Russian participation. The objective is to 
activate mechanisms affecting the specific socioeconomic 
problems of vast areas of Russia. Through these mechanisms, 
while consolidating a unified state policy, federal organs must 
help the components of the Federation to realize their foreign 
economic interests. 
  The experience of the past two years has shown that any 
discord, be it departmental or regional, in foreign policy 
ultimately damages state interests and undermines Russia's 
positions in the world. The new Russian Constitution put 
everything in its place. The coordination of Russian foreign 
policy in the context of national security strategy must be 
strengthened. 
  The Federal Assembly must examine the following questions: 
  -- the ratification of around 60 international treaties; 
  -- the adoption of laws ensuring the effective functioning 
of 
the Russian foreign policy mechanism (a law on RF international 
treaties, a law on diplomatic service, and consular rules); 
  -- the adoption of laws supporting Russian foreign economic 
relations (a law on the continental shelf and economic zone, a 
law on exports of weapons and military equipment); 
  -- the elaboration of new laws or amendment of existing laws 
in the humanitarian field taking account of Russia's 
international commitments. The dual citizenship part of the Law 
on Citizenship must be brought into line with the Constitution. 
The status of foreigners in Russia must also be brought into 
line with international standards by the adoption of a 
corresponding law for this. 
  The sooner we adopt laws meeting present and future 
requirements, the greater will be the extent of the cooperation 
with foreign countries which we need so much and the more 
appreciable will be the return from the enormous opportunities 
offered by foreign policy. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  An enormous country like Russia cannot be transformed 
rapidly 
and painlessly. We need a flexible long-term policy taking 
account of world experience, national characteristics and 
traditions, the developing situation, and changes in public 
interests and sentiments. Such a policy has nothing in common 
with either conservatism or reformist dogmatism. 
  What is needed is not to strive to achieve the impossible, 
not to dissipate forces but, on the contrary, to concentrate 
resources and political will on the key areas in order to 
achieve a breakthrough to something better. When reforming, 
things must not be left absolutely to their own devices. The 
Message proposes how to organize this work. 
  The primary task is to build cooperation. The time of 
political confrontation is past. The country needs consistent, 
creative, joint work. In December 1993 tens of millions of 
people with differing views voted for the Constitution in a 
nationwide vote. In Russia today it is impossible to find a 
stronger base for achieving accord. 
  The Constitution provides an opportunity to start a real 
process of unifying all society's constructive forces and to 
channel the energy which has hitherto been expended on 
confrontation and fragmentation, into benefiting the country and 
its citizens and strengthening the Russian state. 
  Weak authorities will wreck reform and be unable to impose 
even elementary order in the country. But renewed estrangement 
between the authorities and people and their everyday needs must 
not happen either. Results can only be achieved if Russian 
people's enormous intellectual and spiritual potential and 
desire to live better are channeled into the nationwide cause of 
building [obustroystvo] Russia. The transformation of social 
life on this kind of scale demands self-restraint of everybody. 
But the authorities are obliged to start with themselves. 
  The legal basis of future constructive accord -- the 
Constitution -- must be supplemented by the formation of a 
stable political structure and a tradition of political 
tolerance in seeking common fundamental values and resolving 
nationwide tasks. Joint work by all organs of power to implement 
the program principles embedded in the Program will make it 
possible to lay the foundation of such traditions. 
  Russia needs social accord. This is why the Message takes 
account of the constructive propopals of parliamentary factions 
and other political forces and social organizations and of the 
views of academics, experts, and practicians in seeking the 
optimum way to extricate the country from crisis, strengthen the 
Russian state, and improve Russians' lives. 
  It is in our power to make 1994 the year of the building of 
creative cooperation, the year of the birth of new political 
traditions, the year of emergence from the crisis. It is our 
task, we have the chance, not to miss the opportunities which 
are opening up.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>
  [Text] It is an open secret that Americans spend on 
intelligence, in other words "espionage", much more than all 
other countries of the world taken together. So, the U.S. 
should not be hypocritical, a high-ranking Russian diplomat told 
Interfax on Friday, commenting on the United States' attempts to 
attach special importance to the case of the Ames couple, 
arrested for charges of espionage in favor of Moscow. 
  To quote this diplomat, "if Americans have any queries about 
specific details, representatives of the Russian and American 
special services should discuss them in the spirit of our 
friendly relations." 
  The Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) has neither confirmed 
nor denied the reports that representatives of the CIA and the 
EIS have met in Moscow to discuss the Ames affair. "We do not 
comment on such information," a representatives of the FIS's 
press bureau told Interfax. 
  He expressed surprise about the hullabaloo raised in the 
U.S. 
in connection with the Ames affair. "We are not doing anything 
in the U.S. that the U.S. is not doing in Russia," he said. 
"Americans are not surprised that their nearest associates -- 
Britain and France -- collect information in the U.S. as well, 
friendship and the secret service are two seperate things," he 
said. 
  He confirmed that Russian competent bodies had collected 
compromising information about American diplomats' and Russian 
citizens' collaboration with the American secret services. He 
gave to understand that "in a certain situation Moscow might 
make use of this material," but expressed hope that things would 
not come to that. 
  Asked about the FIS's possible reaction to the U.S. 
administration's decision to oust the Russian diplomats who 
worked with the Ames couple, he said that this is not the FIS's 
business. Such decisions are taken at a high political level - 
by the president or government - and are implemented through the 
Foreign Ministry. The FIS has nothing to do with this, he added.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Vanichkin] </F>
  [Text] Washington February 25 TASS -- The U.S. President 
met leaders of the Congress in the White House on Friday. The 
meeting was attended by lawmakers from the Democratic and 
Republican Parties. 
  The White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said that the 
meeting of the U.S. President with congressmen focused on 
providing U.S. aid to Russia. Recently, a number of U.S. 
lawmakers called to freeze U.S. aid or reduce it, following a 
scandal which flared up around the CIA officer Aldrich Ames and 
his wife charged with spying both for Russia and the United 
States. 
  "Undoubtedly, the president intends to oppose any efforts 
aimed at reducing U.S. aid to Russia," Dee Dee Myers said, 
adding that the president is convinced that the politics of the 
U.S. Administration, including its support to Moscow, meets U.S. 
national interests. 
  Dee Dee Myers said that at present, the U.S. and Russia are 
making efforts to settle the problem around the "Ames" case at 
different levels and using different channels. The press 
secretary pointed out that the Russians had not responded to 
U.S. demands so far, adding that they expected a reply in the 
near future. No one of the U.S. administration has mentioned 
yet what demands Washington made on Moscow, motivating their 
silence by the interests of national security. 
  Presumably, one of the channels expected to be used by the 
two sides to resolve their problem is a visit to Washington by 
first Russian Deputy Foreign Minister G. Mamedov. The 
high-ranking Russian diplomat, who arrived in Washington on 
Thursday night, intends to meet U.S. First Deputy Secretary of 
State [title as received] Strobe Talbott and other foreign 
ministry officials on Friday. 
  Mamedov's visit to Washington had been scheduled long ago to 
discuss different problems of international politics. 
Nevertheless, talking to journalists on Friday Mamedov made it 
clear that the "Ames case" would be discussed. "We are concerned 
about anything which might be detrimental to Russo-American 
partnership," Mamedov said. "However, we believe that we have 
accumulated enough confidence and gave sufficient impetus to 
these relations so that we could overcome any problem," he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rutkowski] </F>
  [Excerpts] At the beginning of today's debate, the floor 
was taken by Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Ivanovich Hryb. 
He appealed to people's deputies and journalists not to support 
abortion, while voting on the draft constitution that is to be 
adopted by our parliament. I will recall that in their ballots, 
deputies are being asked to define their position on the 
legislative, executive, and juridical authorities of the 
Republic of Belarus, and respond to whether our state should 
become a presidential republic. The results of the voting will 
be announced next week. 
  Having heard the speeches delivered in the miscellaneous 
section, deputies continued the debate on amendments to the 
electoral law. After that, they began to discuss the Supreme 
Soviet draft resolution on the volume of foreign debt and trends 
in the use and repayments of foreign credits. The draft 
resolution specifies that the volume of foreign debt of the 
Republic of Belarus will amount to $2 billion until the end of 
1994. [passage omitted] 
  Because today is Friday, deputies voted to shorten the 
working day. The session concluded at 1700 [1200 GMT]. 
Deputies will reconvene at the Oval Hall of the House of 
Government next Tuesday.

<F P=106> [News conference by President Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk </F>
with unidentified correspondents; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, as we have 
learned -- from the foreign mass media, unfortunately -- you do 
not intend to take part in the early presidential elections 
being held in June of this year. From the press service's 
explanation we may draw the conclusion that one of the reasons 
is the the extremely compressed time period for holding 
elections for all the power structures. The refusal expressed 
in the interview is not your final word, however. Please tell me 
under what circumstances you would be able to review your 
decision. 
  [Kravchuk] I (?will draw your) attention to the fact that 
our 
mass media and the foreign mass media are currently paying, 
well, solid attention, I would say, to this problem. Well, the 
press here is international. So I do not think that it is of 
special significance in which newspaper or at what microphone it 
was said first. The main thing is that it was said. 
  I would not like this problem to be viewed solely in the 
context of the president as an individual. I saw this when I 
drew these conclusions (?in the) interview, the context of the 
formation of power in Ukraine. For example, let us try to 
predict the variants. The issue here is not so much the 
compressed time period as the situation that might arise. 
  If, for example, on 27 March, the entire composition of the 
new parliament is not elected. Well, I'll say, for example, 200 
deputies are elected, or even 150. The current parliament does 
not have 450 deputies at present, there are somewhat fewer than 
that. Thus if new deputies are elected in 150 districts, then 
there will be fewer than 300 in the current parliament; that is, 
less than two thirds. It will immediately not be competent, no 
matter what is said. I will refer to you to the Constitution, 
article 104 -- the Supreme Council of Ukraine is competent to 
adopt decisions if there are no fewer than two thirds of the 
actual number of people's deputies of Ukraine present at the 
sitting, whose authority is recognized and has not been 
suspended by established legal procedure, but more than half of 
its constitutional composition. It is clearly stated. 
  It cannot be that two people's deputies come to the Supreme 
Council, one from the old convocation and one from the new 
convocation. A collision arises immediately. Such a collision 
arises because there is in fact no old Supreme Council, you see, 
but there is no new one yet. The run-off elections take place, 
say, after two weeks. 
  The law on run-off elections is a complex one, a very 
complex one. How will it be, say, if another 100 deputies are 
elected -- 150 [at the 27 March election] and 100 [at the 
run-off election]; we will have 250 altogether, or maybe 280, 
or 290. Again we do not have the necessary 300. We do not have 
them here, and we do not have them there. Ukraine does not in 
fact have a legislative body. 
  The elections move on to the next stage, that is elections 
of 
a president then, and elections of local chairmen of 
authorities. What happens? There is no Supreme Council as such. 
The new government is not formed. Its authorities have not 
been determined. The president is the only legitimate figure, 
who in fact can realistically manage the situation together with 
the local administrations and bodies of power in the localities 
-- all of them -- with councils, or rather the councils' 
executive bodies and representatives, and the president's 
administrations. There is no one else to do it. 
  If at this time the president also, the president who is in 
power, runs for election, clearly the danger of a collapse of 
executive power becomes probable. That is, in this case I am 
not speaking about my possibilities or my wish [to run] or not. 
I am driven into a corner -- either to leave everything and run 
for election or to be responsible and not to take this step. 
  Thus my decision depends on many factors. The first one is 
the election of the Supreme Council and the creation of a new 
government -- this without fail. Then the new government -- the 
Supreme Council having, say, adopted a law on the cabinet of 
ministers, determines the government's powers, let us say, 
transfers executive functions to it, and the government begins 
to work. Executive power is in the hands of the government. 
This is the first thing. 
  The second thing is that it is still necessary to determine 
what kind of president is going to be elected and with what kind 
of powers. If this happens in accordance with the present 
Constitution, the president will again be elected as head of 
state and head of the executive authority with the relevant 
powers. You know how many questions there are with this. We 
must determine this; that is, the president or a person who is a 
candidate for the presidency, who runs for elections, knows what 
his future powers will be and who he will be in the state. This 
has not been determined at present. If he is elected in 
accordance with the present Constitution, then the issue will 
arise with the new Supreme Council of what sort of law there 
should be on the cabinet of ministers, what the powers and 
functions of the cabinet are, and the tugging of powers will 
begin again -- from the president to the Supreme Council, from 
the Supreme Council to, say, somewhere else, between the 
president and cabinet of ministers. All of this vagueness is an 
important point. 
  The third thing: If, having elected a new president in June 
and chairmen of executive, rather chairmen of local bodies of 
power, we have not determined the powers once and for all of 
those chairmen, and have not determined when they could be 
suspended, or in some other way if they violate, for example, 
the Constitution or laws, who is to stop this? That law says 
this will be determined by a separate law, but when will we have 
this law? Before the election of those chairmen, so that they 
know their final powers, or will it be after that, when they 
have been elected and have begun to adopt laws? That is, we 
have been working in such a tight schedule over this. 
  I do not want to blame anyone, but remember how the 
preparation for elections proceeded -- under pressure of 
strikes. A decision on a referendum was adopted. Then a 
decision on elections was adopted. Time went by. Time was short 
and an extremely complex political situation arose, or can 
arise. So I said that in this situation my responsibility for 
the state is greater than my wish to run in the coming elections 
for president. This is the logic. There is no need to, say, 
raise banners about this. 
  There is another aspect, and I must tell you about it. It 
is not so much political as moral. I studied, like all of us, 
in school and out of school, history and the fate of various 
presidents, but I have not come across such dirt, such lack of 
culture, such badgering as some people feel free to do, for 
example, in parliament and outside parliament, and certain mass 
media, as in Ukraine. 
  This could become a phenomenon of the history of the 
Ukrainian state, when the first president, he might be liked, he 
might suit someone, or he might not -- one can elect one or 
elect a new one in a legitimate way, but to feel free to do such 
things, establishing in the consciousness of generations such a, 
I would say, boorish psychology, as some are striving to do and 
are doing, this simply causes indignation, not just my own 
personal indignation, but I see in some of my colleagues, too. 
  Clearly as a person, in this case, not as president, I 
cannot 
understand this, and I do not want to understand this. Here is 
a factor that affects and will affect my decision. I cannot but 
say this to my people. These are two aspects of it, which I 
wanted to tell you about, so that you convey this to the 
electors, who naturally are also interested in this decision by 
the president and what has caused it. 
  [Correspondent] A question from HOLOS UKRAYINY. Leonid 
Makarovych, as is well-known, elections under conditions of a 
difficult economic crisis are always a risky matter. And Russia 
is an example of this. In addition, many of your political 
opponents connect our economic ills with Ukraine's course toward 
independence, and now are especially demanding the restoration 
of absolutely all links with Russia and CIS countries. And some 
people are even proposing the Belarusian variant, which we know 
about. What can you say about this? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, this is a subject of many aspects. Its 
first aspect, from my point of view, is that in our 
time--especially a year to one and a half years ago, thanks to 
the vigorous, say, political activity of certain political 
forces--we established in people's consciousness that the main 
reason for the economic and social suffering was the severance 
of economic links, and everything, say, boiled down to this 
severence of economic links with CIS countries. I explained 
then, if you remember, that if one is to restore all economic 
links, which existed previously, then one would have to restore 
the Soviet Union, to restore or to keep unchanged the whole 
structure of industry in every CIS country. 
  Yesterday Russia's president said in his speech that Russia 
should produce what Russians need and that which can be 
competitive. The same goes for Ukraine and for other states, 
and to speak of restoring all links is simply nonsense because a 
new, new states and new economic structures are being 
constructed. The point is to restore necessary links, to create 
a market, for example, within a CIS framework -- whether a 
common market or a market is not important, so as not to lose 
this market and to trade on this market, to sell, to buy, to 
resolve customs issues, other issues, tax issues, price issues. 
All of this needs to be coordinated, generalized, and 
elaborated. This is a normal process, but to speak again about 
the previous links and to restore them all means restoring the 
military-industrial complex; this means restoring everything 
that we, Ukraine, produced as a part of a former great power. 
This is the first thing. 
  And at all meetings now, you see, links are not mentioned. 
Whoever wanted these links established them, for example 
Zaporozhsich, it has splendid links with Russian enterprises, 
and it works. There should be links between enterprises and not 
between one state and another. This is a normal phenomenon. 
States should create the right conditions between themselves, 
but entrepreneurs and businessmen, plants, factories, 
industrialists, agriculturists, commercial people, should 
establish links between themselves, trade and produce. This is 
the first thing. 
  The second thing: If a decision had suddenly been taken 
here, 
say, by Ukraine, like Belarus as you say, to enter the ruble 
zone, I am convinced that Russia would not want this. It would 
not have been able to carry our state, because what would it 
mean for Russia to take Ukraine into the ruble zone? This would 
mean giving Ukraine a considerable, even a very considerable 
quantity of rubles--I cannot even name a figure--and this is its 
wealth. This means it would be necessary for Ukraine to do [as 
heard] or Russia would have demanded such concessions on the 
part of Ukraine, which would have brought its economic 
independence to nought, to nought. 
  If one is to ask the question today, one should ask it 
directly, frankly, and sincerely, that Ukraine is changing its 
course with regard to its continued economic and political 
independence and is agreeing to such a decision -- the formation 
of some other kind of, say, union, or whatever it might be 
called. That is, I am in favor of a common market, in favor of 
resolving all economic and political issues by way of 
coordinated actions by CIS states. Here an economic union can 
play an appropriate role, too. 
  Maybe, you see the Asian countries have created a single 
economic space, but they have not created a unified currency. 
(?I have in mind) CIS countries. We could have created a 
single economic space, for example, Russia, Ukraine, and 
Belarus, or the whole economic space, but this with one's own 
currencies, one's own banks, one's own independent credit and 
financial structures, that is, as an independent state. For 
example, the three Baltic states created what is called the 
Baltic Assembly, but no one is losing or taking steps to lose 
their independence. 
  Any kind of economic integration is a realistic process, but 
it should clearly determine whether states are integrating or 
whether some kind of autonomous or oblast structures are 
integrating. This should be clearly explained to people. Those 
who hint at something, that we should change our course, we 
should do this and do that, they are simply either afraid to say 
sincerely what they finally want -- and we have such sirs, who 
were in power in their time, who are now hinting at various, 
say, variants, and want to win for themselves a post of national 
hero and savior of Ukraine. There are such people. 
Incidentally, they could have done this when in power, but one 
should then say directly, this is my surname, these are my first 
names and patronymic, and I am telling you that one should put 
an end to all of these problems of independence, unite in a 
single state, and may that state then live on. Why deceive 
people and say that some want this, and some want that, but I 
want something, but do not know myself what, or maybe I know, 
but I am afraid to say what. 
  [Correspondent] A question from URYADOVYY KURYER, please. 
Leonid Makarovych, should one not view the program of actions 
and first steps of the new president of Crimea as the beginning 
of Ukraine's federalization? What is your attitude to the idea 
of Ukraine's federalization in general? 
  [Kravchuk] I think that when such a complex issue is to be 
resolved, one should always turn to history. See how federative 
states were formed. Well, take Germany and the United States 
for example. They were formed historically by way of annexation 
at a certain time, lands there, states there, to a state 
structure, which was already formed. For example, the state of 
Texas was annexed considerably later than, say, other states; 
that is, this was a process of annexing territories to a state 
structure, which were annexed on appropriate terms. And 
federations formed in this way. 
  We have a unitary state. Well, the Crimea, its special 
status, is simply, say, connected with its history surely. I 
will return to the Crimea later. So why now, when we have a 
unitary state, does one consciously suddenly begin to divide it 
into federative centers from above, well what for, when there is 
an undivided unitary state, not large in territory, if one is to 
compare it, for example, with other states, and is compact, 
having history in common. I am in favor of regions having the 
most extensive economic self-determination, the most extensive, 
in issues of, for example, the budget, finances, customs, I mean 
customs problems on the borders, and so on, influence on 
enterprises, powers connected with managing state property, of 
which there is a great proportion there now, that is the most 
extensive [economic self-determination], including Crimea. This 
is my point of view. It seems to me that this is the most 
realistic point of view at present, which will not cause another 
division and redivision of our political problems. Well, 
Russia's experience shows that Russia as a federation, and it 
was not formed yesterday, has problems, too. So we will begin 
suddenly, and we will begin with problems. 
  Regarding Crimea: Well, people often accuse the president 
and the Supreme Council chairman that we are supposedly the 
chief culprits for there being an Autonomous Republic of Crimea. 
I would like to refer you to 1990 again, to history, when the 
Soviet Union still existed, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the 
USSR Congress of People's Deputies, and the Communist Party of 
the Soviet Union existed then, too. And then the Crimeans, and 
the Crimean party -- the Communist Party -- and the oblast 
council put the question of a referendum regarding autonomy. 
And the second point -- the issue of what kind of status was 
discussed, where was Crimea to belong -- it was already 
beginning to be discussed then. Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev 
often hinted to me -- you watch what is going on in Crimea. I 
knew for certain then that if I did not support what was 
happening there, if I banned it, then this would not mean that 
everyone there would suddenly listen to me. 
  Then Crimea would turn directly to the USSR, not to Russia, 
and the Supreme Soviet, having the powers, would adopt this 
resolution, because there was a unified Soviet Union, and all of 
this talk that Ukraine was a state in the Soviet Union, well we 
know what sort of a state it was, and Crimea would transfer from 
Ukraine. Now, when we have done this, it is not so simple now. 
The Union institutions, which could have adopted this, do not 
exist now, and Russia signed a treaty with Ukraine on us not 
having territorial claims on each other, back in 1990. 
  In this way this question sounds entirely different now, 
and now, and in the agreement, which we signed in Moscow with 
Bill Clinton and Yeltsin with regard to nuclear questions, there 
is a stance there that territorial integrity and inviolability 
will be respected both by the United States and by Russia, and 
so on. Already we, when--I say this frankly, I have never said 
this to my people, but there is speculation going on around this 
and people are speculating who know this well. Perhaps they are 
making use of this in an election campaign. God knows. Or 
perhaps they are simply showing ignorance, although I do not 
think that academicians can show ignorance in this matter. 
Although it happens. Therefore, I am saying sincerely that 
this was a considered step. 
  Now there have been elections for a Crimean president. 
People 
became so absurd as to ask whether I really have the right to 
meet the president of Crimea. Well, firstly, this is not a 
right that I am going to ask anyone for. This is the first 
thing. I could not have met him under one circumstance -- if 
Ukraine's Supreme Council had revoked the law on elections of 
the Crimean president and they had taken place, then the Crimean 
president would have been outside the law and I would never in 
my life have met him. 
  But as this did not happen, that is, elections are 
elections, 
I meet him, and it is my opinion that it is better to meet than 
not to meet and it is better to resolve issues than not to 
resolve them and drive them into a dead end. It is better to go 
along the path of, say, mutual understanding, and not the path 
of confrontation. I am convinced that the new president of 
Crimea, the new government, and everyone will go along this 
path, because the other path leads to trouble. They would be 
the initiators of this trouble; they would assume the highest 
responsibility, because Ukraine, if we are looking at this, is 
fussing and bothering over Crimea so much that there is nowhere 
to go from here. 
  And we will talk about of how many violations there are of 
the (?letter of) the law, and the referendum law was violated, 
for example, which does not comply in the constitution to 
Ukraine's referendum law, the Crimean one I mean, the referendum 
law in Crimea. And the Supreme Council, the Presidium, and all 
of us, sent documents, said that they should be brought into 
line with Ukraine's Constitution. They keep biding their time. 
  Yesterday, the Supreme Council adopted an appropriate 
document and gave explanations. I think that this should 
influence--influence reason, common sense--that Crimea is at the 
moment an autonomous constituent part of Ukraine and any actions 
directed against this most important political, say, pivotal 
issue, will necessarily be viewed as illegal, as illegal. This 
should be kept in mind. I think that we will manage to settle 
these issues, we will manage to settle them, and again we will 
resolve them by way of talks, by way of debates, by way of 
coordination both of legislative and executive power documents 
and structures. 
  [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, Ukrainian Radio, news 
service. I would like to return to our difficult economic and 
domestic situation and the related foreign economic policy of 
our state. In your opinion, why is privatization not occurring 
in our country? And what is it necessary to do to activate 
foreign investments? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, privatization has not occurred for many 
reasons. First, we worked on privatization legislation for a 
very long time. This is the first thing. The second thing is, 
legislation is all very well, but various political forces, and 
in the power structures too, in their time had varying attitudes 
to privatization. The previous governments, Kuchma's government 
and Fokin's government, did practically nothing for 
privatization, practically nothing. Everything was frozen. 
  Only now are the first steps beginning to be taken. 
Appropriate programs are being adopted. Appropriate actions 
have begun in the regions, but again this will depend on how 
people there, from the village council to the Cabinet of 
Ministers, will act and resolve these issues. That is, we were 
late with privatization. 
  Although, I should tell you that privatization in Ukraine, 
taking account of its heavy industrial structure--for example, 
33 percent is concentrated in the military-industrial complex of 
the former Soviet Union. Well, you see, these are giants, and 
is it really so simple to privatize the Malyshev Plant or the 
Southern Machine-Building Plant. We smelted half the metal in 
Ukraine. Is it really so simple to privatize metallurgical 
plants, mines, and so on? One has to see all of this. This is 
a fearful structure -- nuclear power engineering and so on, but 
we are late and now these steps have begun. 
  Second, taking account of our leaps I would call them, in 
such an acute issue as nuclear weapons, where we announced one 
course to begin with, said we would manage to become nonnuclear 
quickly, then started to refine it. There were such layers that 
it then became entirely incomprehensible to some what we really 
wanted. This led to economic assistance to us being frozen on 
the part of Western countries. I will give you only one 
example. You probably know it, but I will give it. For 
example, assistance to the Baltic countries -- all of Western 
assistance in relation to gross national product comes to 25 
percent. For Ukraine it is 0.5 percent, and only now, when we 
have determined our position with regard to this acute issue for 
the world, for humanity, has some kind of gradual progress begun 
somewhere. This does not yet mean that it is finished, but it 
has begun. For example, normal economic relations have begun to 
be established, and there is an entirely different attitude to 
us. 
  Therefore, there are many reasons here and what occurred 
was our fault. I am being frank. There are objective problems 
here, but the fault for the inconsistency and indecisiveness, 
both in privatization and in the entire sphere of politics, was 
severely marked in this sphere of life. [1 minute break in 
transmission] ...to work and earn money. I do not see that there 
is any other way. The situation regarding pensioners, doctors, 
and teachers is different. They are subject to the budget and 
there is a different attitude toward them. Let us say, Ukraine 
has up to 40 million hectares of land: We spend a lot of time 
deciding whether or not to give them land; we then make a 
decision to allow them to, let us say, build together with the 
land and make a decision not to let them build with the land. 
  As you see there are people with such a mentality who live 
constantly in fear that we will sell the land to somebody. If 
somebody wants to build a factory in Ukraine, and if we say that 
the land on which the factory is built belongs to the factory, 
then what is wrong with this? We must not think like this. We 
are always arguing about this. I repeat, we have 39 million 
hectares of land in Ukraine. This is practically 1 million 
hectares per person, or even more if we are only talking about 
adults. Where is the problem here? 
  Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch, during the Supreme Council 
sessions, mentioned figures of many countries, including Turkey 
and other countries, where the population is the same and where 
they utilize only half of their land and, as well as being 
self-sufficient, they also export their products. But we cannot 
even do this. Land must be utilized. I would advise that in 
life we must work and earn a living and produce. At present, 
the majority of the population has begun to earn in a different 
way, instead of producing and earning a living. This is our 
misfortune and I must not severely condemn this. If one-third 
of the population is traveling to the market on trains, then 
this is a particular phenomenon, although if you remember there 
was a similar situation six or seven years ago in Poland and 
Poles were everywhere in China, Jamaica, etc. They were buying, 
selling everything and transporting it, but now they have begun 
some other activities because there is an accumulation of funds 
and they have begun to work. One has to experience this. There 
must be a desire by everyone to find a way out. It is no use 
saying that the president has not found a way out. Let them 
elect a holy president tomorrow, if one could be found. He will 
not be able to solve anything on his own, unless, at first, 
there is a desire on the part of everyone to work and secondly, 
unless there is accord in society. We should know that we must 
manage this land, this Ukraine, because nobody will do it for us. 
  Some are calling for (?dependency), and others are calling 
for a return to the old structures, and now there is an 
electoral campaign and it is arousing the people. You must 
understand that this does not give the people vigor, strength, 
nor optimism. There should be an objective. I understand that 
the people have become disillusioned. They even say: Why should 
I go and vote and who should I vote for? These are the kind of 
letters I am receiving. But I would like to say something with 
regard to my answer to your first question. Without fail, we 
must have elections, it is worse not to. There must be an 
authority. When there is authority there is also hope and let 
us say, levers that will not permit surprises. There will be 
somebody who will make the decisions. 
  For example, let us say that the Supreme Council cannot be 
convened. The president has authority with regard to executive 
power in Crimea. Elections have taken place. Certain processes 
of a legislative nature have taken place in Crimea. Who should 
repeal what has taken place in Crimea? How should the Supreme 
Council act? I would like the people to understand that it is 
all very difficult, very difficult. They ask: Who should I 
listen to? You are all promising something, why should I go and 
vote? But elections must be held in order to preserve the state 
and make an important step in forming the political and power 
structures. 
  Some say that the new Supreme Council will be worse than the 
present one. I will not say whether it will be worse or better. 
It will be a new parliament. Those deputies who do not want 
elections keep on saying that it will be worse. We will see 
what kind of parliament it will be, but the main thing is that 
the Supreme Council should be elected, and that it should begin 
to take steps toward a structural reorganization and political 
reconstruction, that it begins to take specific steps toward 
reforms, market and social protection. It should not go from 
one extreme to the other depending on polarization or political 
inclinations. It should be a Supreme Council with a clear 
policy that will form a government. The government will present 
a program and a process of normal work should begin. We have to 
go along this path. I turn to the people with a call to 
overcome these personal problems at the time of the elections. 
I know that when people go to cast their votes and, let us say 
a bus does not turn up, they come back and angrily say that if 
they do not want us to vote, we will not vote. 
  We must understand that we are talking about authority. The 
state must have authority. If it is no good, then we must 
reelect it. If there is anarchy then that will be the end and 
there will be trouble. There could be a collision or 
confrontation or something else. We must not allow this. I 
simply wanted to explain the situation because as I can see, it 
is taking on such a tone and there are various interpretations 
that do not precisely define my position or my views. Sometimes 
people say to me that I am interested in the elections not 
taking place. I have the most interest that elections take 
place. Perhaps those who want to preserve their positions for 
some considerable time are interested. Regarding myself, I have 
defined my position and have told you this frankly, and I tell 
the people and everybody else that I have no personal interests. 
My interest is that of Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Article by Baiba Melnace: "Turlais Returns From NATO </F>
Northern Group Training"] 
  [Excerpt] Riga, 11 Feb -- For the first time, the Baltic 
states, Poland, Russia, and all Scandinavian countries, which 
thus far do not belong to NATO, took part -- on partnership 
rights -- in NATO Northern Group staff training "Viking rewiev 
'94" in Norway. Latvia was represented in this training by the 
Commander of the Latvian Defense Forces, Dainis Turlais. 
  All three commanders from the Baltic states had a separate 
meeting with the chiefs of the Scandinavian Armed Forces. The 
most important was the meeting with the Danish high-level 
military persons, D. Turlais told DIENA. During the talks, a 
decision was made that Latvian officers would begin their 
training with Danish assistance as early as this month. A plan 
was worked out to prepare the Latvian officers for the joint 
Baltic peace battalion. The Scandinavian states have decided to 
create a council with the aim of coordinating military aid for 
the Baltic states. 
  As DIENA was told by Turlais, this year the training had a 
special meaning -- how to create new relations between the 
northern states and the Baltic states in the framework of the 
Partnership for Peace program. The foreign minister of Norway 
made a forecast for the nearest future -- Sweden and Finland 
would join the EC and later would become members of NATO. 
Subsequently, this would show the Baltic states the way to 
integrate in the group of the Scandinavian states and next also 
in NATO. 
  The mayor of St. Petersburg Anatoliy Sobchak Spoke against 
this very sharply and categorically. He described such 
cooperation as a threat to Russia, which absolutely cannot be 
permitted. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with President Algirdas Brazauskas by Aldona </F>
Svirbutaviciute in Vilnius on 9 February: "President -- Already 
or Only a Year?..."; first paragraph is TIESA introduction] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Svirbutaviciute] A year 
after the presidential elections on 9 February, I asked 
President A. Brazauskas how he would today reply to the question 
as to what path Lithuania has chosen and what course it will 
continue to follow. 
  [Brazauskas] This will be the continuation of the 
course that Lithuania followed last year. We are conducting 
reforms and trying to make well-considered moves. One must 
always see our weaknesses and losses. I pose very many 
requirements to the executive power, because state management is 
difficult. These issues are difficult to resolve, although some 
people used to think differently in the past. It does not 
matter what people will be in power in the future. The 
important thing is that the state must be run by professionals. 
Decisions of the executive power, their quality and rate of 
adoption -- this is what the authorities must care about. 
Recently, there has been much talk about government officials. 
I have become strongly convinced that we must not only speak 
about them but also create a basis for the adoption of 
government decisions. I am speaking about the activities and 
the quality of the executive power. I do not maintain, however, 
that we must replace the latter and elect a new one. I am for 
the stability of the government and its institutions. If one 
cannot perform one's duties well today but wants to learn this, 
he or she must receive support. I see from many facts that we 
are unable to do many things, but we are willing to learn. My 
goal is to achieve considerable improvement in this sphere in 
1994. I want us to adopt the law on government officials and 
other indispensable acts, impart responsibility, and define the 
functions of ministries and departments. [passage omitted] 
  [Svirbutaviciute] The president, as number-one person in 
Lithuania, is often observed as if through a magnifying glass. 
This observation started long before the Seimas and, 
particularly, the presidential elections. It has continued 
until now. How have you managed to reconcile this, and how do 
you assess the reprimands concerning the rejected draft law on 
the declaration of property and income of government officials 
and employees? 
  [Brazauskas] By using the right of legislation, the 
president's office is currently drafting a new law. We intend 
to promulgate it. This law must correspond to the spirit of the 
Lithuanian Constitution. One cannot single out one group of 
persons, think that they are "swindlers," and prepare the law 
specially for them. This is not the case in the world. We are 
drafting it based on the experience of the world where the 
declaration of property is commonplace. I have always said that 
I will be the first to declare my property and income. I 
suppose that the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party faction in 
the Seimas [parliament] did not adhere to its principles in 
voting for this law. Such a law cannot exist. The concept of 
family is particularly confused there. It follows from this law 
that both my parents and my children, who have not lived with me 
for more than 15 years already and who have their own families, 
are accountable for my property. It is paradoxical that even 
minor children must declare their assets: The pants that a 
mother buys for her son will have to be declared. The majority 
of those who accuse me most blatantly for rejecting this law 
have never read it. For example, during my visit to Klaipeda I 
asked the people there whether they had read it, and the reply 
was negative. So why are they accusing me? All people must 
declare their property and income. This is not easy and cannot 
be achieved immediately. Let us adopt this law by stages and 
steps. The president, the government, and Seimas deputies must 
declare their income in the first place, and later be followed 
by others. This law is not an instrument for catching crooks. 
The target of such laws throughout the world is to collect 
taxes from citizens which they owe the state. That is why I 
vetoed this draft law. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The city court of Schelkovo, a district center in 
the Moscow region, today recognized the returns of the elections 
in the Schelkovo single-mandate constituency No. 114 which 
elected Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to the State Duma on February 12 
null and void. By this decision, the court satisfied the suit 
against the regional election commission filed by a former 
candidate of the same constituency, head of the Moscow 
anti-trust committee, Doctor of Economics, Professor Oleg 
Novikov. 
  In an interview with Interfax, Novikov said his action was 
caused by "numerous gross violations" of the regulations for the 
election of deputies to the State Duma approved by the Russian 
president. 
  In particular, the candidate withdrawn by the election bloc 
"Yabloko" in favor of Novikov was not crossed out of the ballot 
paper. 
  In its materials handed over to the mass media, the election 
commission described Novikov, who was nominated as an 
independent candidate and canvassed about 6,000 signatures in 
his support, as a candidate of "Russia's Choice." 
  In addition, the commission failed to provide all candidates 
with equal access to television so that they could lay down 
their programs. According to Novikov, he was not even given a 
10-minute televised statement envisioned by the election 
regulations. 
  According to Russia's legislation, the court decision may be 
appealed against within a period of 10 days. Otherwise, it will 
be automatically enforced.

  [Text] Moscow February 26 TASS -- A letter of Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin to State Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin 
reminded him that the pardon is a presidential prerogative under 
the Russian Constitution. The letter was passed over today by 
presidential adviser Georgiy Satarov. 
  The letter says the deputies used the notion of "political 
amnesty" instead of the "pardon" term. Referring to the 
presidential message, Boris Yeltsin also reminded the speaker 
that civil reconciliation does not mean all-forgiveness and 
clemency should not run counter to the law and morals. 
  The president offered deputies of the lower parliament 
chamber to improve the resolution and bring it in correspondence 
with the constitutional norms. Yeltsin also considers it 
necessary to elaborate a criterion of politicians' 
responsibility for their decisions, says the letter.

  [Text] Moscow February 26 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin has sent a letter to speaker of the Russian State Duma 
Ivan Rybkin. 
  "I am very satisfied with the Duma intention to follow the 
path of national reconciliation, civil peace and accord. I am 
convinced this intention is sincere. This is what I call for in 
my annual message that was passed over to you on February 24, 
1994," says the document. 
  Recognizing and respecting constitutional powers of the 
Duma, 
including those related to the amnesty issues, Boris Yeltsin 
noted that the formula used in the resolution is rather not an 
amnesty but a pardon, which is a prerogative of the president. 
He also thinks that the resolution did not fully develop the 
practical side of the issue, insufficiently considered and 
ensured political and social consequences of the decision. 
  "In this connection and aiming to consolidate the spirit of 
constructive cooperation and accord, I suggest to: 
  1. Improve the resolution and bring it in full 
correspondence with the Constitution and the Russian legislation. 
  2. Develop and adopt as a memorandum a system of criteria, 
forms and mechanisms of responsibility of state institutions and 
politicians for decisions whose consequences hamper our joint 
policy towards national reconciliation, civil peace and accord. 
  I would be grateful if you consider it possible to do this 
work together with presidential representatives," says the 
letter. 
  Sources at the presidential press service told ITAR-TASS, 
State Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin met presidential adviser Georgiy 
Satarov today to discuss the implementation of measures 
suggested by the Russian president in the letter to the Duma 
speaker.

  [Text] The demand by the Russian President to "suspend the 
amnesty" declared by the State Duma, is not legitimate, Interfax 
was told Saturday by the chairman of the security committee of 
the Russian State Duma Viktor Ilyukhin (Communist party faction). 
  He believes the resolution of the political and economic 
amnesty is "the right and timely act. It does not flare up a 
civil war. It is those who are trying to stay in power." 
  Ilyukhin said that according to the Russian Constitution 
adopted at the referendum on December 12, the adoption of the 
act on amnesty is the prerogative of the lower house of 
parliament and "the president, and the Federation Council have 
nothing in common with it. [no end quotation mark as received] 
  Speaking about the resignation of the Russian Prosecutor 
General Aleksey Kazannik, Ilyukhin said that he made a premature 
step. "If he really wants to guard legality and order, he must 
not resign but implement the decision of the legislative body." 
  The State Duma, believes Ilyukhin, will confirm the act 
again, since most deputies voted for it. 
  By his actions the Russian President has confirmed again 
that 
he had never respected the old Constitution and will not respect 
the new, presidential Constitution, said Ilyukhin.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Kontantin Pribytkov] </F>
  [Text] Fribourg (Switzerland), 27 Feb -- According to 
Sergey Filatov, the head of the Russian president's 
administration, it is necessary to clarify the legal aspects of 
the decision by the State Duma on political amnesty. "This is 
not a matter of the individuals to whom the decision applies. 
This is a matter of principle. A precedent is being created in 
society when the article `Political Rehabilitation' is extended 
to criminals or people charged with committing crimes," he told 
an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "This is incomprehensible to 
Russian society and to the rest of the world, and it is this 
aspect that should be clarified first and foremost." 
  Filatov, who is in Switzerland to take part in a 
Russian-Swiss academic seminar organized by the Institute of 
Federalism of the Fribourg University, said in the interview he 
regretted that the Constitutional Court was not working. In his 
words, the court ought to decide whether the decision of the 
Duma was constitutional. "If we have decided to live according 
to the Constitution, then this ought to be justified by the 
Constitution." 
  The concept of "political amnesty" presumes that there was a 
political offense. "But what is at issue are people that have 
committed a criminal offense," Sergey Filatov continued. "And 
this criminal offense cannot be given an amnesty by the said 
resolution. Because neither the carrying of arms, nor the use or 
keeping of arms, nor calls to use violence -- all the things 
that these people are accused of -- can be given an amnesty. 
That is the craftiness of it. In general, it has no legal 
precedent." 
  The head of the Russian Federation Presidential 
Administration reminded that two people who used arms have 
already been convicted by the court. "The court has ruled and 
they are already in prison. What kind of political amnesty can 
one talk of here?" 
  The intentions of those who initiated the decision are 
clear: 
"To reach peaceful accord, to refrain from stirring up the 
things that happened. They must be stirred up," Filatov 
believes. "The culprits should be identified by name. We have 
been moving toward this goal for longer than 24 hours. 
Unfortunately, we have been moving toward this goal for almost 
a year, starting from the Seventh Congress. All the 
conciliatory initiatives by the president were met with a 
categorical rejection, there was aggression and hostility that 
put one part of society at loggerheads with another. Somebody 
must answer for that." 
  "When people speak about political amnesty, I would like 
first of all to define its meaning," the head of the 
presidential administration remarked. "If there are political 
crimes in our country, those guilty must be found here, too. Is 
it somehow related to the political rehabilitation of people who 
were sentenced and repressed at one time? No, the situation is 
totally different, and I believe therefore, that a full stop 
should be put here in a legal appraisal."

impossible to guarantee the requisite volume of gas supplies 
owing to a sharp drop of pressure in the pipelines.

<F P=106> [Colonel Gennadiy Miranovich report: "Collective Security </F>
Treaty Must Work. This Was Theme of Routine Session of CIS 
Defense Ministers Council"] 
  [Text] As we have already reported, the session was held 
24-25 February. Delegations from the military departments of 11 
countries, the general secretary of the Collective Security 
Council of the CIS member states, and representatives of the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the legislature, 
and the Border Troops Command participated in it. A number of 
organizational questions concerning the structure of the Defense 
Ministers Council, the manning of the Staff for the Coordination 
of Military Cooperation, and the preparations to celebrate the 
50th anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War were 
examined, as well as problems of the use of the collective 
peacemaking forces and of military-technical cooperation. 
  It was pointed out at the session that the countries which 
signed the Collective Security Treaty have at last gotten a real 
opportunity to commence its practical implementation. As is 
known, since Belarus, Azerbaijan, and Georgia subscribed to the 
treaty, the composition of the Defense Ministers Council 
virtually corresponds to the composition of the Collective 
Security Council, which includes, in addition to the heads of 
the states which signed the treaty and the foreign ministers, 
the leaders of these states' military departments. 
  The two-day gathering of the military departments' leaders, 
held under the chairmanship of Colonel General Boris Gromov, 
Russian deputy minister of defense, ended with the signing of a 
number of documents. They include the Statute on the Defense 
Ministers Council of the CIS Member States, which defines its 
functions, structure, and composition and the organization of 
its activity under the new conditions. A decision was adopted 
on the composition of the Military Cooperation Coordination 
Staff and on the principles of its manning. As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA 
reported (the issue for 23 February), the staff will be manned 
on a coalition basis, and it will have a top limit of 250 
members. At the same time the Russian contingent will be the 
largest -- 120 people. The session participants' balanced 
approach to problems of collective security enabled them to 
reach agreement on additional measures to stabilize the 
situation on the Tajik-Afghan section of the border. A decision 
was also adopted on measures to prepare to celebrate the 50th 
anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War.

  [Text] Moscow March 1 TASS -- The announcement of a 
political and economic amnesty by the Russian Federation's State 
Duma at the end of February and the likely impact of the 
decision on the development of the situation in the country are 
under discussion in today's Russian newspapers. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI recalls that "the leaders of parliamentary 
groups who voted for a political amnesty explained the need for 
it by striving to maintain civil peace". 
  However, "it appears evident that the release of the 
'political prisoners' not just stimulate the activities of the 
hardline opposition -- it will entail the emergence of quite a 
number of organisations whose activities would be quite capable 
of destabilisiing the situation in the country". 
  In addition, the situation is also being compounded by the 
fact that the Lefortovo investigation ward inmates and forces 
supporting them have no representation in parliament, for 
well-known reasons. "This is precisely why their struggle for 
the division of political space may become particularly fierce". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA frontpages an analytical article under 
the headline "The Opposition Has Got Competitors From Lefortovo. 
The President Begins To Regroup Forces". 
  Recalling the events of the October last year in Moscow, the 
newspaper points out that "the developments connected with the 
release of the 'Oktobrists' have vividly shown the extent of 
contradictions that tear the presidential team asunder". 
  "Of course, the State Duma decision about an amnesty hardly 
gave pleasure to the president. However, there is every 
indication that those presidential team members who believed 
that the 'Oktobrists' are much more dangerous in the symbolical 
image of martyrs than in the image of real political figures 
gained the upper hand". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on former Vice-President Aleksandr 
Rutskoy: "As a politician, he undoubtedly enjoys a considerable 
prestige. But one should take into account that he became the 
leader of the entire opposition and a real alternative to Boris 
Yeltsin by virtue of his high position, in the extreme situation 
of a coup d'etat". "At present, however, opposition politicians 
(Zhirinovsky, Zyuganov and Baburin) should view him, rather, as 
a potential competitor: for, according to people close to 
Rutskoy, he intends not only to return to politics but also 
participate in the future presidential elections". 
  TRUD on a probable development of events in Russia following 
the amnesty. 
  The newspaper believes that "if the political struggle 
unfolds in uncivilised forms, those factions which voted for an 
amnesty on the plea for a quest for civil peace would find 
themselves in a rather difficult position. 
  "This primarily applies to the Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord, whose votes enabled the duma to pass the decision on the 
release of the 'Lefortovo inmates'. 
  "It is not ruled out that in the event of a flare-up of 
extremism, the parliament will have to take some additional 
measures if it comes to realise the danger posed to the country 
by such a development of events". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on the same subject: 
  "It is already evident to everyone that there can be no 
question of any 'civilised forms' of political struggle. 
"Moscow, which became somewhat calmer recently, will again be 
divided into zones of influence while the president loses time 
irretrievably and together with it the last levers of power". 
  PRAVDA carries an interview with State Duma Speaker Ivan 
Rybkin. 
  In response to a question from the newspaper's correspondent 
about the amnesty, Rybkin pointed out that the meaning of the 
amnesty "is to give a chance to those who took a false step to 
turn a new leaf at this difficult and critical time. The 
purpose is to consolidate society so as to pull the country out 
of chaos through common efforts". 
  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA runs an interview with former speaker of 
the Supreme Soviet Ruslan Khasbulatov who was released from 
Lefortovo under the amnesty. 
  Khasbulatov touched upon some provisions of the president's 
message to the Federal Assembly, pointing out that the message 
consists mainly of what he, Khasbulatov, once said at congresses 
of people's deputies. 
  "This means that the presidential team who prepared the 
message accepted the Supreme Soviet evaluations. Surprising is 
something else. Those people are unable to accomplish this task 
by virtue of their being oriented to the destruction of Russia, 
to the conduct of war against their own people". 
  PRAVDA carries an interview with Belarusian parliament chief 
Meczeslaw Hryb who was elected to the post at the end of 
January. Sharing his vision of how to take the republic's 
economy out of the crisis, he said it is essential, first of 
all, to restore economic ties with "ex-Soviet republics, 
particularly with Russia". "Only an economic union and a common 
monetary system can save the situation as I pointed out on more 
than one occasion," Hryb said.

  [Text] Moscow March 1 TASS -- It is necessary that Russia, 
the United States and other countries pool efforts in order to 
find a political settlement of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
where the peace process must be continued and given a new 
impetus, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said. 
  Speaking at a meeting with Russian and foreign journalists 
in 
Moscow on Monday, Kozyrev said that the Foreign Ministry is 
dealing with the Middle East "as much as with Bosnia. We 
maintain direct contacts with the PLO, Yasir 'Arafat and 
Israel." He said the Russian side plans to take constructive 
steps in the near future. Particularly, a special envoy of the 
Russian president, Igor Ivanov, will fly to the Middle East 
"within several hours," he added. 
  As for "today's incident with the planes in Bosnia," "we 
have 
no information about their identification so far. All three 
warring factions have planes of which type. They were shot down 
in the area where fighting is going on between Croats and 
Moslems. But in any event this falls within the recently 
adopted U.N. Security Council resolutions which ensure the 
'no-fly' zone ban, for which Russia had also called for," the 
Russian foreign minister said. 
  Moscow is against using aviation. There is a proposal to ban 
the use of aviation in all was zones, Kozyrev stressed. He said 
Russia was one of the initiators of the resolution on 'no-fly' 
zones. "In this case we are for the resolution to be observed in 
the strictest possible way and any side which embarks on the 
path of their violation should be ready to face the severest 
consequences," he said. 
  He emphasised that the recent events in Bosnia show that the 
way to peace in the region is not in escalation of violence and 
the use of aviation, but in political settlement. 
  Kozyrev called for a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher to discuss the "entire spectrum of problems." 
he said The idea has been discussed by telephone several times 
and now the sides are trying the set a convenient date. 
  Touching upon the spy scandal in the United States, Kozyrev 
said that from the very beginning of the "spy history" the 
policy of President Boris Yeltsin, the Russian Government and 
the Foreign Ministry was aimed at avoiding the "politicisation 
or ideologisation" of the problem. 
  The Russian side believes it "lies within the competence of 
the security services" of the two countries. "As far as I know, 
the services maintain regular contacts and are able to settle 
the issue on their own," Kozyrev said. 
  "Unfortunately, the United States has expelled (Aleksandr) 
Lysenko who was an official representative of (Russian) 
intelligence bodies in Washington in accordance with an 
agreement between the governments of the two countries. Today 
the U.S. Embassy in Moscow was informed that the Russian side 
wants his American counterpart to leave the country," the 
Minister said. 
  The Russian side did not want this. "We had to resort to 
this 
'reciprocity,'" he added. He stressed that both countries 
should do away with this practice "the sooner, the better." 
  Kozyrev believes the incident will not affect U.S.-Russian 
relations.

Smelov] 
  [Text] Moscow, February 28 (TASS) -- CIA agent James Morris 
working as a counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow was 
declared persona non grata on Monday, following the expulsion of 
a Russian diplomat in Washington. 
  A U.S. diplomat was summoned to the Department of North 
America of the Russian Foreign Ministry earlier today to receive 
the following statement: "The Russian Foreign Ministry is 
lodging a protest against illegal activities of the American 
side with regard to an official representative of the Russian 
foreign intelligence service who has been working in Washington 
since the summer of 1993 by mutual consent" of Russia and the 
United States, Ministry spokesman Grigoriy Karasin said. 
  "In this situation, we have to declare, on the basis of 
reciprocity, a CIA officer in Moscow persona non grata and 
demand that he leave the Russian Federation," the statement said. 
  "The Russian Foreign Ministry proceeds from the fact that 
there are special channels for settling issues arising on both 
sides in connection with intelligence or counterintelligence 
activity. These channels can and should be engaged. This will 
allow (us) to find a mutually acceptable way out from the 
current situation and avoid its politicisation," the statement 
said. 
  The U.S. Embassy has been also presented with a diplomatic 
note. 
  ITAR-TASS has learnt that Morris will leave Russia within 
seven days.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Abarinov report under the "Intelligence" rubric: </F>
"Russia Strikes Back. CIA Station Chief in Moscow Declared 
Persona Non Grata on a `Reciprocal Basis'"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the Russian Foreign Ministry made a 
representation to the counselor envoy of the U.S. Embassy in 
Moscow in connection with the deportation of Aleksandr Lysenko, 
official representative of the Russian Foreign Intelligence 
Service [FIS] in Washington. "In this situation," the note 
says, "we are forced to declare the CIA representative in Moscow 
persona non grata and to request that he leave the Russian 
Federation on a reciprocal basis. The Russian Foreign Ministry 
proceeds from the assumption that there are special channels for 
settling matters that may arise with regard to the intelligence 
and counterintelligence activity of the two sides. These 
channels can and should be put in operation. This will make it 
possible to find a mutually acceptable way out of the current 
situation and to avoid its politicization." When asked by your 
SEGODNYA correspondent to specify, Grigoriy Karasin, director of 
the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry press and information 
department, said that the person in question was James L. 
Morris, counselor at the U.S. Embassy. 
  Morris was given seven days to leave the country, same as 
Lysenko. It has transpired from other sources that some time 
ago the secret services of Russia and the United States were 
going to reveal to each other one representative working under 
diplomatic cover each, although, of course, without the right to 
publish their names. Aleksandr Lysenko assumed his job in 
Washington last summer and has no relation to Ames. In Moscow, 
his deportation has been perceived as a purely political action, 
and there have been attempts to conceal the fact that actions 
taken against Morris are a retaliatory measure. 
  According to that same source, there have been no agreements 
on the mutual cessation of intelligence activity between the 
Russian and U.S. special services. There is, however, an 
agreement on forgoing "uncivilized methods" of recruitment. 
Nonetheless, the Russian side has evidence proving that the 
U.S. special services have been using just these methods. The 
Russian services, the source claims, are not interested in 
arousing passions over the Ames case and, on their part, would 
not like to make cases involving U.S. agents public. For the 
time being, CIA Director Woolsey "is carrying on considerately," 
an approach that Moscow interprets as showing a similar desire. 
Russian professionals have already made clear that they stand 
for continuing cooperation with their American counterparts, but 
they believe that the cooperation may only be based "on the 
common perception of national interests." At the same time, the 
source emphasized, there are influential forces in the United 
States wishing "to impose a time-out" on President Clinton so as 
to take a closer look at what is going on in Russia. 
  The decision regarding Morris was made personally by the 
president. According to our information, the dismissal of 
Golushko from the post of Federal Counterintelligence Service 
[FCS] director does not have any bearing on the Ames case. At 
the same time, according to unconfirmed reports, arrests have 
been made at the FCS central staff and the Federal Agency of 
Government Communications and Information.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Kolesnichenko] </F>
  [Text] New York, 28 Feb -- The American corporation 
"Gerardo International", which works on developing secret 
weapons systems for the Pentagon, thinks that Aldrich Ames, 
arrested last week on suspicion of spying for the former USSR 
and then for Russia, could have supplied Moscow with secrets of 
the production of a new invention of the company -- the 
so-called "MRX" defense technology. The president of the 
corporation, Neil Gerardo, expressed his anxiety at this 
circumstance in a letter to Congressman John Mica (Republican, 
Florida), which has been made available to the ITAR-TASS office 
in New York. 
  The document notes in particular that the company's 
management became concerned when one of its staff in Belgium 
reported the details of a Reuter interview with LDRP [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia] leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in 
which the latter declared for the first time that Russia had an 
ultra-secret offensive weapon called "Elipton." The description 
of this mysterious weapon given by Zhirinovskiy turned out to be 
similar to the "MRX" defense technology developed in the 
"Gerardo International" laboratories. 
  "Our company, like many other institutions that are 
developing high-technology weapons systems, knew of and welcomed 
the actions of the U.S. Government's intelligence departments in 
monitoring our lines of communication, because this met the aims 
of national security," the letter pointed out. "Today our 
anxiety has increased even more after the arrest of Aldrich Ames 
on suspicion of supplying secret information to Moscow. We in 
'Gerardo International' have done everything possible to keep 
the 'MRX' production methods a secret. However, after the 
events that have taken place we fear that the technologies of 
this system have been 'blown'. We call on Congress to carry out 
a thorough investigation of this urgent matter. We should like 
to know how many people, and precisely who, have access to 
information on the 'MRX' production technologies." 
  The ITAR-TASS correspondent called a representative of 
"Gerardo International," but he flatly refused to comment on the 
letter, saying that as yet he had nothing to add to the above 
version.

make a pause in the bilateral relations due to the case of

[sentence as received] 
  According to the same source, there was definitive pressure 
exercised on U.S. President Bill Clinton and his Aide Strobe 
Talbott in this direction. 
  Commenting on possible response of the U.S. to expulsion of 
U.S. Minister-Counsellor James Morris from Russia, the 
high-ranking officer told Interfax that "escalation was 
undesirable. However, Interfax it is to take place it will be 
bilateral." He said Moscow was unwilling to surrender its 
positions. 
  He also emphasized that, in his opinion, the lay off of the 
Federal Intelligence Service's Director General, Nikolay 
Golushko, had nothing to do with the Ameses.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian General Kalugin, "former KGB agent </F>
in the United States," by Fiammetta Cucurnia in Moscow; date not 
given: "The KGB is Certain: `Someone Betrayed Ames'"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- The Russian superspy among the top CIA 
officials was betrayed by an undercover mole working for 
Washington among the former KGB's leadership. However, Ames was 
the last of the Mohicans -- a leftover who miraculously survived 
the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the former Soviet 
secret services. This is Oleg Kalugin's opinion, a former KGB 
man who no doubt is knowledgeable on the subject of spies, not 
only in his capacity as one of Moscow's former agents in the 
United States, but also because from 1973 to 1980 he was the 
head of the KGB's counterintelligence section. 
  [Cucurnia] Do you really believe, General Kalugin, that 
someone here in Moscow, perhaps among Primakov's deputies, 
betrayed Ames? 
  [Kalugin] It is difficult to name or point my finger at 
anyone in particular. However, I certainly cannot rule out the 
possibility that someone within our services passed on the 
information to the Americans, also because, clearly, only very 
few people, at the highest level within our services, have any 
knowledge of these matters. As soon as you consider this 
business you are immediately led to think that there might be a 
traitor among this very small group of people. 
  [Cucurnia] You do not seem to be all that surprised by what 
has happened. 
  [Kalugin] On the contrary, I was rather surprised by it 
because, frankly speaking, I believed that our network of agents 
in the West had been definitively routed. You must take into 
account that, between 1980 and 1991, the KGB experienced the 
most difficult period in its history, not only due to the fact 
that its officials were fleeing to the West, but also due to the 
many arrests among those of our agents who had gone over to work 
for the United States. 
  [Cucurnia] Yet the Ames case shows that some important 
outposts survived. 
  [Kalugin] As I was telling you, I was the first to be 
surprised. Let us not forget, however, that Ames was apparently 
recruited in 1985, when perestroyka was in its infancy, and the 
radical change in United States-Soviet relations was still to 
come. Clearly, Ames was one of the last remnants of an epoch 
that is now coming to a close. 
  [Cucurnia] Do you think that Gorbachev first, and later 
Yeltsin, knew that they could rely on such a high-placed agent? 
  [Kalugin] When I worked for the intelligence service, we 
used 
to make regular reports to Brezhnev on our agents in the West. 
We always indicated the duties they fulfilled and their rank, 
but we never mentioned any names. I believe this practice has 
not changed. It makes no sense to fill the president's head with 
names which, in themselves, mean nothing to him. 
  [Cucurnia] However, over the last few years the United 
States 
and Russia have repeatedly exchanged friendly declarations. Do 
you think that it is proper to use the citizens of another 
country for intelligence purposes, or perhaps, as Clinton says, 
it would be best to limit recruitment to your own fellow 
nationals? 
  [Kalugin] Let us leave hypocrisy to one side. The United 
States has never renounced espionage, much less so in Russia. I 
see no reason why Russia should. However, the fact remains 
that, unlike what used to happen in the past, nowadays 
intelligence operations do not pursue subversive objectives. 
Nobody today can assert that the CIA wants to weaken Yeltsin's 
position. Rather, the contrary may be true. Espionage, 
however, has always existed and always will, even between 
friendly countries.

  [Text] Moscow March 1 TASS -- Experts from Russia's Foreign 
Intelligence Service regard the publication of information about 
Aldrich Ames' alleged involvement in the transfer of technology 
to Russia for the development of a supersecret weapon as a drive 
launched by U.S. secret services with a view to attracting the 
public attention to the "Ames case". 
  The reason for this and other actions, the Russian experts 
believe, is the more understandable as, according to data 
available with them, U.S. secret services so far have no real 
evidence of Mr. Ames' involvement in spying for Russia.

  [Text] Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) has 
started an investigation to conjecture the possible effects of 
the case of the Ames couple, accused of spying for the Soviet 
Union and subsequently Russia, a source close to the FIS said. 
  The source told Interfax on Monday that one of the aims of 
the investigation was to reveal sources of possible information 
leakage from the FIS. 
  "I don't think we have any 'moles' or 'rats' in our service, 
but extra caution will do us no harm," he said. 
  He declined to either confirm or deny that the Ameses had 
been Soviet and Russian intelligence agents. 
  "The investigation has nothing to do with the apprehensions 
that somebody penetrated our intelligence files and found the 
Ameses there," the source said. 
  He said the West was bound to make the most of the Ames case 
to disorganize Russian intelligence and its networks abroad. He 
also said the CIA and other Western intelligence services are 
paying closer attention to Russia, and that there exists "a 
growing spy mania in the United States, comparable to that of 
the Cold War times."

  [Text] The success achieved by the Russian diplomacy in 
former Yugoslavia is one of the reasons for the clamor growing 
in the USA about the case of the Ameses couple who allegedly 
spied for Moscow, according to Americans, Interfax learned from 
the Russian competent bodies. 
  Another reason for this is the intention by certain circles 
in the USA to impose a "time-out" in its relations with Russia 
and watch the developments in Moscow. 
  As is the established procedure, Russia's competent bodies 
do 
not intend to comment whether the Ameses worked for Russia. 
This is explained by the fact that Moscow would not like to 
influence the trial which will be soon held. Moscow believes 
that the court will have to toil enough, because there is no 
substantial evidence against the Ameses, according to the US 
press. 
  The Russian competent bodies categorically disagree with the 
point of view widely shared in the USA that America has "special 
powers" and may carry out intelligence activities against 
Russia, while Russia cannot do so. Moscow and Washington have 
never signed an agreement to give up intelligence activities 
against each other. Moreover, the CIA does not even try to hide 
the fact that Russia remains one of its priorities. 
  Interfax also learned that the Russian competent bodies were 
amazed at the deportation of a Russian diplomat, Aleksandr 
Lysenko, who had been introduced to the American side as a 
representative of the Russian intelligence, according to an 
agreement between the Russian secret service and the CIA. 
Lysenko arrived in the USA last June and, as a matter of fact, 
was only being put in the know of developments. 
  If the CIA delegation composed of two persons tried to 
represent the deportation as "a forced victim" with the aim to 
"loosen the situation," then Moscow believes that Lysenko was 
made a "scapegoat." 
  Regarding this action by the US Department of State as 
purely 
political, Moscow decided to declare the advisor of the US 
embassy in Moscow, James L. Morris, persona non grata as a 
measure of "mutual payment." The decision was made on the level 
of the Russian president. 
  Moscow believes that the deportation of J. Morris will be a 
full stop in the disagreement, and the staff of the Russian 
embassy in Washington will not be reduced by a single person. 
Otherwise, Moscow's reaction would be prompt. However, the 
escalation of this issue was not a choice of Russia. 
  According to Interfax information, the decision by the US 
Department of State followed the arrival in Moscow of a CIA 
delegation composed of two persons. The CIA officials tried to 
force the Russian secret services to recognize their involvement 
in the Ameses' case by voluntarily recalling the Russian 
diplomat who allegedly worked with the Ameses couple. 
  The American officials also insisted on Moscow's taking no 
measures in response and making no comments to the press. This 
was made condition to continuing the mutually profitable 
cooperation between the Russian and US secret services. 
  All these demands were regarded as unacceptable in Moscow. 
  At the same time, the Russian competent bodies were not in 
the least interested in fanning "spy mania." They have evidence 
of several dozens attempts to recruit Russian citizens by the US 
secret service. In a number of cases, Americans used "illicit 
methods" such as blackmail which is not in use by the Russian 
intelligence. However, Moscow did not make a fuss using this as 
a pretext, like the USA did it with the Ameses' case. Nor the 
Russian secret service put emphasis on other cases when Russian 
citizens collaborating with the CIA and the FBI were arrested 
and brought to trial. 
  The Russian secret service understands that the Ameses' case 
was a serious psychological blow to the CIA, but it does not 
want to gloat at it. 
  Moscow believes that the CIA internal security should not be 
made issue of interstate relations, and the further developments 
will entirely depend on the American side.

<F P=106> [Commentary by ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Romantsov] </F>
  [Text] New York, 1 Mar -- After arresting the CIA employee 
Aldrich Ames and his wife on a charge of spying for Russia a few 
days ago, the Washington authorities might have concentrated 
their attention on finding the answer to this question: how can 
it be that somebody managed to steal secrets from Langley, the 
holy of holies of U.S. special services? That, incidentally, is 
what the administration is being strongly advised to do -- and 
by those who themselves headed the special services in the past. 
  But Washington decided that it was far more important to 
"punish" Moscow as quickly as possible (Moscow, mind you, and 
not Ames or those in the CIA who allowed this failure to occur). 
They announced the expulsion of the Russian diplomat, Aleksandr 
Lysenko. Lysenko was asked to leave purely because of the 
position he held at the Russian embassy (he was accredited to 
Washington as an intelligence officer and dealt with cooperation 
between the two countries' special services), and not because he 
was in any way implicated in the "Ames affair". No accusations 
have been levelled against him. 
  Is it any wonder, after this, that James Morris, an American 
diplomat who worked as a counsellor at the U.S. embassy in 
Moscow, now has to leave the Russian capital far earlier than he 
intended to? He has been given seven days to leave. However, 
to be more precise, Morris was not a diplomat, but a CIA officer 
holding a diplomatic passport. One would rather not use 
expressions like "an eye for an eye" or "a tooth for a tooth," 
but it would have been incomprehensible for the American 
demarche to go unanswered, to go without "reciprocation". 
  Washington is implying that it is now time to put this 
entire 
incident behind us. White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers, 
expressing regret about the expulsion of Morris, said: "We do 
not expect any further diplomatic moves." Vice President Albert 
Gore stressed that relations between the United States and 
Russia "ought not to be determined by such incidents." 
  This is both heartening and encouraging. It is, indeed, time 
to close the curtain on this affair, but once the fly-wheel has 
been started, it is not always easy to stop it. Certain people 
in the United States, including a number of congressmen, are 
exploiting the "Ames affair" to say that Russia should not be 
assisted and that a closer look should be taken at its 
"behavior." Certain people are already portraying Russia's 
peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, which helped to stop the 
bloodshed, as an "imperialist scheme." 
  One is reminded of the euphoria that there was in Washington 
over the fact that neither ideological rivalry nor confrontation 
would any longer determine relations between the two greatest 
powers on earth. Moscow was just as happy about this, but 
different judgements are now appearing more and more frequently 
here. Here's a quote from the journal `Nation': "The rivalry is 
continuing. Now and in the future Moscow will play the role of 
geopolitical superpower, whose interests, history and character 
run counter to the interests of the United States." 
  Naturally, the interests of the United States and Russia, as 
two sovereign states, can and will diverge, but there is 
obviously no point in seeking out and then enlarging the cracks. 
Instead one should seek and build on points of contact. The 
hullabaloo which has been raised over the "Ames affair" is 
hardly likely to facilitate this.

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by ITAR-TASS correspondents Andrey Palaria and </F>
Vladimir Smelov] 
  [Text] Moscow February 28 TASS -- The spy scandal that has 
broken out after the arrest of a senior CIA agent on charges of 
spying for the Soviet Union -- and then for Russia -- for nearly 
a decade has led to a traditional "exchange of figures" between 
Moscow and Washington. 
  The United States has expelled Russian foreign intelligence 
service official Aleksandr Lysenko who worked as a counselor of 
the Russian Embassy in Washington. Russia retaliated on Monday 
by expelling his CIA counterpart James Morris who worked under 
diplomatic cover in Moscow. 
  The arrest of Aldrich Ames, 52, and his wife is not the 
first 
in the history of intelligence. The world knows many such 
affairs. However lately Russia and the U.S. have tried to hush 
up such incidents, to say nothing about bringing them to 
inter-state level. But this "biggest spy scandal," as the Ames 
affair has been dubbed in the U.S., did not pass unnoticed and 
attracted the attention of U.S. President Bill Clinton who 
described it as a "very serious case." 
  "The psychological drama" caused by the failure in the 
Central Intelligence Agency was followed by an urgent trip of 
CIA officials to Moscow to "settle scores" and "persuade" the 
Russian side to "admit its guilt" in the Ames affair by ordering 
Lysenko to leave the U.S. and keep the whole incident away from 
the press. 
  However, the Russian side made it clear that such issues 
should be settled by respective intelligence services of the two 
countries which must stick to certain rules in their activity. 
Otherwise would run counter to the principles of partnership 
between the Russian and American intelligence services which are 
actively cooperating in fighting illegal drug trafficking, 
terrorism and organised crime. 
  However, the Ames affair has shown that this partnership is 
still far from being ideal. Perhaps, as far as the accusations 
against Aldrich are far from being true. 
  Indeed, American intelligence bodies do not have proof of 
his 
guilt so far, according to the U.S. press. American newspapers 
have picked up again the once-forgotten image of "the Russian 
bear" and other Russian "intrigues" threatening national 
security of the United States. Some speculations border on the 
absurd as their authors are trying to persuade American tax 
payers that they are supporting Russian spies. 
  Many in Moscow are surprised by such open politicisation of 
the Ames affair. Observers do not rule out the possibility that 
this can be connected with the success of Russian diplomacy in 
Bosnian settlement and the desire of certain American circles to 
get a time- out in relations between Russia and America. Even 
more so because many members of the U.S. Administration are 
calling for support for Russian reform and assistance to Russia. 
  Western experts, many of whom are professional intelligence 
officers, believe that Russia has sharply stepped up 
intelligence activity in the United States lately. However, no 
one can deny that after the collapse of the Soviet Union Western 
secret services, including the American CIA, have boosted their 
work in ex-Soviet republics, primarily Russia. 
  Examples abound. Those include the arrest of a top-level 
agent and several attempts to recruit high-ranking Russian 
officials. Last year alone, 20 people were arrested in Russia on 
charges of espionage. But, unlike the Ames affair, none of 
these cases caused any demarches or protests at the inter-state 
level. 
  Recent U.S. moves can be interpreted in different ways. This 
is the prerogative of specialists, but even a dilettante 
understands that Russia has as much right to conduct 
intelligence activity in America as the U.S. has in Russia. At 
least until Russian Foreign Intelligence Service Chief Yevgeniy 
Primakov's call for discontinuing spying against each other is 
answered.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Kuznechevskiy article: "The Powers Syndrome? On </F>
the Arrest of Russian Agents in the United States"] 
  [Text] The incident over the arrest in the United States 
of two Russian foreign intelligence agents, Aldrich Ames and his 
wife Maria Casas, has alarmed the public in that country. No 
wonder. The 52-year old Ames worked in the most sensitive posts 
in the CIA for over 30 years and has vast experience of overseas 
work. In 1983-1985 he was head of the CIA's Soviet 
Counterintelligence Section and was one of the most trusted men 
in the state. His attractive 40-year-old wife, who was born in 
Colombia, had the most brilliant career prospects at Georgetown 
University. 
  They could be called a model family unit of a healthy U.S. 
society but suddenly, overnight, they have become Russian spies. 
Yet they had good incomes. Ames was paid around $100,000 a year 
(around $9,000 a month). This is enough to make the ordinary 
patriotic American's head spin. And when it became known that 
Russian intelligence had paid this married couple around $1.5 
million since 1985, the sense of outrage became universal: What 
kind of Russian treachery is this? We give them aid and they 
spend millions on espionage activity in our country! 
  It seems that the U.S. President was also in some confusion: 
Ames was placed under surveillance [blokirovan] last October but 
it was not until Monday, 21 February 1994, that Bill Clinton 
allowed the case to be made public. 
  There is no limit to the U.S. press' indignation these days. 
However, let us leave emotions aside and try to delve a little 
deeper. 
  The Ames case has been given the kind of political overtones 
which automatically bring to mind a story dating back almost 33 
years. 
  In 1960 the United States and the USSR took the first real 
steps toward ending the cold war, thanks to the efforts of 
President Dwight Eisenhower and Prime Minister Nikita 
Khrushchev, general secretary of the CPSU Central Committee. 
Agreement was reached to hold a summit meeting of the four 
great powers in Paris after which Eisenhower was to pay a visit 
to Moscow. However, the hawks in the military-industrial 
complexes and the CIA and the KGB put the most powerful pressure 
on their top leaders and wrecked what could have been an 
historic agreement. 
  On 1 May 1960 the CIA sent a U-2 spy plane into Soviet air 
space, it was shot down near Sverdlovsk, and its pilot, Frances 
Garry Powers, was taken prisoner. Khrushchev kept the fact of 
this arrest secret and, according to the classical laws of 
political intrigue, lured Eisenhower into a trap by forcing him 
to deny that this flight had taken place. At the Paris summit 
he demanded public apologies from the U.S. President and this, 
of course, was a humiliation for Eisenhower. And without even 
waiting for a reply from his colleague he exclaimed in great 
emotion: "Eisenhower is no longer a welcome guest in the Soviet 
Union!" The U.S. President was about to explain that he had 
come to Paris for serious talks and wanted the conference to 
move on to the discussion of relevant questions but the summit 
was already wrecked by then. Khrushchev ostentatiously walked 
out of the hall. 
  That was, of course, a political mistake. The Soviet premier 
had given way to the hawks in his own country, people who in 
general were more interested in their own position in the 
hierarchy of power, a position falsely concealed by a concern 
for the country's security and well being, rather than in 
peaceful living conditions for the USSR. 
  Relations between the United States and the USSR 
deteriorated sharply. Soon after that there was the Caribbean 
crisis, which almost plunged us all into World War III. 
  It seems to me that something similar is going on right now. 
Except that this time certain forces in the United States would 
like to give Khrushchev's role to Bill Clinton. And Powers' 
role to Aldrich Ames. 
  The U.S. mass media have been trying to meticulously 
calculate what damage the Russian spy's activity has caused the 
States. What can you say here? Probably the damage is 
considerable. But intelligence is a two-day business. In 
recent years the world press and the Russian press have written 
quite a lot about the fact that U.S. intelligence agents are 
virtually wandering freely around Russia's vast open spaces. 
And what escape is there these days from the reports in the 
Moscow press that the exposure of Ames was not a consequence of 
the couple's extravagant spending, as the ordinary American is 
persistently reminded by his press, but resulted from a leak of 
information from the highest levels of the Russian Foreign 
Intelligence Service (in normal parlance that means that a U.S. 
intelligence operative of Ames' stature is operating in Moscow, 
too). 
  But what about the damage that has been done to our 
country's 
economy by our native traitors, as it were? For example, the 
activity of Oleg Penkovskiy, who was recruited by the Western 
special services, really rocked the USSR's defense system in the 
past. And how can you assess the damage inflicted on our 
country by Oleg Gordiyevskiy and Arkadiy Shevchenko, who were 
recruited by those same special services and who held very high 
posts in the Soviet hierarchy? And what about Vladimir Rezun 
(Viktor Suvorov) or General Lyalin? The list could go on. 
  No, the matter is of course not one of economic damage and 
Russia's treachery. 
  In the U.S. media, clearly, there are circles which could 
theoretically be categorized as hawks (we have them in our 
country, too) and which were merely seeking an appropriate 
pretext to exaggerate this affair. But the real reasons are 
clear to see. Not everyone liked Viktor Chernomyrdin's new 
government. The question was: To support him or not? 
  The second reason was clearly Moscow's position on the 
Sarajevo crisis. Essentially the Russian president's initiative 
in this conflict thwarted the hawks' attempt to resolve the 
"Serbian question" with the help of air strikes. Russia's 
political weight in the international arena rose suddenly and 
very sharply. It proved very difficult to endure this and 
assess it not as one would like but as it really is. So they 
decided to use the Ames' affair to try to stop this process of 
Moscow's return to the great powers' club if it seemed likely 
that the process would succeed. 
  I think, however, that no good will come of these attempts. 
The U.S. President, like his Russian counterpart, is showing 
quite a well balanced approach here. 
  There is a striking difference between how the Ames affair 
is 
being covered in the U.S. press and in official statements. 
  For example, it is reported that the note handed to Russian 
Charge d'Affaires V. Chkhikvishvili in Washington contains 
nothing which would indicate the likelihood of a complication of 
relations between the United States and Russia and there are no 
calls for any specific actions. Furthermore, it has emerged 
that yesterday President Clinton turned down the calls by some 
U.S. legislators for an immediate reduction of U.S. aid to 
Russia in connection with the Ames affair. Pointing to the 
gravity of "the espionage affair," he stressed that cooperation 
with Russia in restricting the proliferation of nuclear weapons 
and support for democracy and reforms in Russia are important 
U.S. strategic interests. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev yesterday urged that 
the "Ames problem" should not be politicized. 
  All this inspires the hope that political relations between 
Russia and the United States will not be aggravated this time 
and that a new Caribbean crisis will not loom on the horizon.

  [Text] Paris/Rome/Jakarta February 28 TASS -- Bosnian 
Serbs, backed by helicopters and armoured personnel carriers, 
launched an attack Monday morning against the Bosnian Muslim 
town of Maglaj. 
  The town besieged by Serbian and Croatian units is under 
heavy gun fire, the FRANCE-PRESSE news agency reported today. 
  The American aircraft carrier "Saratoga" with 70 war planes 
aboard has cut short her visit to Trieste in Italy and is 
heading towards the cost of former Yugoslavia, the Italian news 
agency AGI reported from Rome today. 
  The agency said it was connected with the morning shooting 
down of four Bosnian Serbs' aircraft by NATO. 
  Indonesia, currently chairing the Non-Alignment Movement, 
demanded an urgent session of the UN Security Council to lift 
the embargo on weapons deliveries to Bosnian Muslims, TASS 
reported from Jakarta today.

  [Text] Zagreb February 28 TASS -- NATO fighters shot down 
four warplanes belonging to Bosnian Serbs over 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on Monday [28 February]. 
  The planes were downed near Novi Travnik after they entered 
the restricted "no-fly" zone in Bosnia-Herzegovina and refused 
to obey NATO planes' orders to land. The planes raided a 
military factory at Novi Travnik. 
  U.S. [as received] Protection Forces commander in former 
Yugoslavia Jean Cot said the incident will have no consequences 
for his units in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Croatian radio quoted the Croatian Defence Ministry as 
saying 
that the planes which attacked the plant had flown from 
southwest, while other sources claimed that they had been sent 
from the air base in Banja Luka. 
  The Serbs are denying their involvement in the incident, 
saying that the military airport in Banja Luka is controlled by 
United Nations and the planes could not take off without being 
noticed. An official of the local press centre in Banja Luka 
said the planes- attackers did not have anything to do with the 
Bosnian Serb air force. 
  Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and his British 
counterpart Douglas Hurd said on Monday that the incident will 
not affect the peace process in Bosnia. 
  Hurd who arrived in Athens for talks on Sunday said the 
reports about the incident are not quite clear, adding that the 
NATO planes acted in accordance with the regulations approved by 
the U.N. Security Council for "no-fly zones." 
  Hurd said he had contacted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vitaliy Churkin by telephone to inform him about his position 
and expressed the hope that he will be able to speak with 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev shortly.

  [Text] Moscow, 28 Feb (ITAR-TASS) -- A statement by 
Russia's Foreign Affairs Ministry was circulated here today 
which said: 
  "According to the information we have so far, aircraft 
guarding the no-fly zone in Bosnia-Herzegovina air space this 
moring shot down four planes that had violated the zone and 
bombed the area at the town of Travnik, that is, in the zone of 
armed clashes between Muslims and Croats. 
  Furthermore, it is alleged that these planes could belong to 
Bosnian Serbs, though the latter's military command denies this. 
The circumstances surrounding the incident are now being 
clarified. 
  Whichever side carried out the military sortie over Bosnia- 
Herzegovina, violating the resolutions of the UN Security 
Council relating to the no-fly zone, it carries all the 
responsiblity for what has happened.

  [Text] Moscow, Feb 28 (AFP) -- Russia implicitly approved 
the downing of four Bosnian Serb aircraft by NATO warplanes 
Monday, saying whoever flew over Bosnia in violation of a UN 
vote carried the full responsibility for what happened. 
  The comment came in a Foreign Ministry statement after 
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic arrived here Monday for 
talks with Russian officials hours after NATO aircraft shot down 
four military planes believed to belong to the Bosnian Serb 
forces. 
  "Whatever party (Serb, Moslem or Croat) flew over Bosnia in 
violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions, it 
must carry the full responsibility for what happened," the 
statement said. 
  The Ministry said it continued to analyse the situation, 
implying that the downing could be criticized at a later date. 
  A high-ranking Russian diplomat earlier told the INTERFAX 
news agency that the Ministry had asked the UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) in Bosnia to explain the shooting down of the four 
Galeb planes by US F-16 fighter jets in a pre-dawn strike Monday. 
  He added that if UNPROFOR information proves to be true, 
"the 
Bosnian Serbs have violated one of the UN Security Council 
resolutions banning any miltary flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  The resolution, adopted last year and backed by Russia, has 
repeatedly been violated by Bosnia's three warring factions -- 
Serbs, Moslems and Croats, the diplomat said.

  [Text] [Unidentified correspondent] How does Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev assess the situation in Bosnia 
now? 
  [Begin Kozyrev recording] We are against the use of 
aircraft, 
and we have a proposal that the use of aircraft should be 
forbidden in the strictest terms in all conflict areas. In 
particular, we were among the initiators of the adoption of the 
resolution on a flight-free zone, i.e. on the nonuse of aircraft 
in Bosnia. Hence, whichever side used these aircraft, it has to 
proceed from the assumption that full responsibility lies with 
the violator of, in this case, the Security Council resolution. 
Certainly this episode is yet more evidence that the road in 
Bosnia should lie not in the escalation of violence, in the use 
of aviation etc., but only in looking for a political 
settlement. [end recording]

  [Text] Moscow February 28 TASS--There is much to be 
clarified about the incident with four planes which bombed the 
town of Travnik in central Bosnia and were brought down by NATO 
air forces, which exercised control over the no-fly zone in the 
air space of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Vitaliy Churkin, deputy 
Russian foreign minister, said on Monday evening. 
  According to him, "It is not clear so far, what sort of 
planes were shot down". 
  As soon as the first report about the incident was received, 
the Russian Foreign Ministry got in touch with the Serbian 
leadership, he told a press conference held in connection with a 
visit of a delegation of NATO officials to Moscow. 
  The Serbian leaders were "utterly bewildered" as they could 
not understand, why the Serbian planes should bomb Travnik, the 
site of Croat-Moslem clashes, Churkin said. 
  "Whatever party should have made the military air raid in 
Bosnia in violation of the relevant resolutions of the UN 
Security Council on the no-fly zone, it bears the full measure 
of responsibility for what has happened," he said. Military 
planes of the belligerents must not fly over Bosnia, he 
emphasized. 
  "If all the reported circumstances should be corroborated, 
it 
will be evident that the regime of the no-fly zone established 
by a resolution of the UN Security Council was violated--with 
all the resultant consequences.

  [Text] At a press conference in Moscow tonight, Russian 
Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin described the 
consultations between the Russian Foreign Ministry and NATO 
experts as the first working event making Russia's joining 
"Partnership for Peace" possible. 
  According to Churkin, the meeting withdrew all remaining 
ambiguities and questions as to Russia's joining "Partnership 
for Peace." "The question was how to make the best use of the 
cooperation with the North Atlantic alliance envisioned by the 
program," Churkin was quoted as saying. Today Russia sees no 
ambiguities and obstacles for the program to function at a 
larger scale, Churkin added. 
  The deputy minister said it was necessary to sign a 
framework 
document and agree on specific areas of cooperation for Russia 
to join "Partnership for Peace." "Now Russia needs to decide who 
and when will sign the framework document," the Russian 
diplomat said. 
  Commenting on the combat jets shot down this morning, 
Churkin 
said the Bosnian government had been in great amazement when the 
Russian Foreign Ministry asked it for explanations. "Bosnian 
planes had no need to bomb Travnik as it is an area of clashes 
between Croatians and Moslems," Churkin was quoted as saying. 
However, "whoever it was who flew above Bosnia, he violated a 
resolution of the UN Security Council and bears the entire 
responsibility for what happened," the deputy minister noted.

  [Text] Moscow, 28 Feb (TANJUG) -- Following talks with 
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin this evening, 
President of the Serb Republic Radovan Karadzic stated that 
their talks focused on the continuation of efforts to restore 
peace in Bosnia. 
  At the moment it is impossible to give any more details 
since 
this process is still under way, Karadzic said. 
  The president of the Serb Republic arrived in Moscow this 
evening and immediately met Russian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vitaliy Churkin. Their tete-a-tete meeting lasted for 45 minutes. 
  "The very fact that we are in Russia and that the Russian 
army is in our country already means a lot," Karadzic said 
following talks with Churkin. "There are a few countries in the 
world that are impartial as regards the Bosnian conflict. 
Russia is impartial in every respect, and it is also a friendly 
country,, Karadzic stressed. He went on to say that these were 
traditional relations and "an old friendship." 
  Speaking about the Russian initiative for the 
demilitarization of Sarajevo, Karadzic said that it saved the 
world many troubles. "We wish the same path to be pursued 
further. It seems to me that Russia has chosen the right way to 
contribute to the resolution of conflicts in Bosnia," Karadzic 
concluded. 
  The president of the Serb Republic is to continue talks with 
Russian officials tomorrow. He is expected to meet Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev.

  [Text] Moscow, March 1 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev announced 
Tuesday [1 March] they had agreed to open the airport in the 
besieged Bosnian city of Tuzla for shipments of humanitarian aid. 
  Kozyrev and Karadzic told reporters that Russian "observers" 
would be deployed at the airport to guarantee it was used for 
delivery of aid including a Russian humanitarian aid shipment to 
be flown there soon. 
  "Russian observers... will guarantee control under UNPROFOR 
and make sure the airport is used for humanitarian and not 
military deliveries," Kozyrev told reporters following two hours 
of talks with the Bosnian Serb leader. 
  UNPROFOR is the United Nations Protection Force. 
  Karadzic said his meeting with Kozyrev was "not easy" and 
the 
Russian minister described the talks as "difficult." 
  Neither gave a date for the opening of the airport at Tuzla, 
but Kozyrev said a shipment of humanitarian aid from Russia 
would be flown into the airport "soon." 
  The city, including the airport, is surrounded by Bosnian 
Serb forces. 
  The airport has been closed for more than a year and 
pressure 
for it to be opened was stepped up at the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) summit in January when Britain and France 
called for its reopening. 
  Meanwhile UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's special 
envoy in the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, visited Tuzla 
airport early Tuesday, his spokesman said in Zagreb. 
  It was Akashi's first visit to Tuzla, where he arrived from 
the Croatian port of Split early Tuesday. 
  Spokesman Michael Williams said, "He'll be looking at the 
situation with regard to the airport and it remains our strong 
hope that the airport can be opened soon for humanitarian 
purposes." 
  "He has made a tour of the airfield this morning, and this 
afternoon he'll be meeting with local and regional authorities," 
Williams said. 
  "At the end of the afternoon he'll be visiting a refugee 
center in Tuzla." 
  Williams said that in Tuzla itself the situation remained 
relatively calm. 
  A total of 14 shells hit the airfield Monday, of which about 
half fell close to the main building.

  [Text] Moscow, 1 March -- A meeting between Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic, who arrived in Moscow on Monday night at Russia's 
invitation, has begun in a mansion of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry. 
  Andrey Kozyrev told Russian and foreign journalists on 
Monday 
night at the Foreign Ministry that at present it is necessary 
for Russia, the United States, and other states to unite efforts 
in the search for a political settlement in Bosnia. There is 
only one way toward peace in Bosnia -- not through escalation of 
violence and using air power, but through a joint search for a 
political solution, he said. 
  Now, following the initiative of the Russian president, it 
is 
important not to lose momentum, tackle the problems of setting 
up safety zones, and work on the implementation of what has 
already been agreed with regard to stabilization of the 
situation in the region, the minister stressed.

  [Text] United Nations, 1 Mar -- Bosnian Muslims are 
against the deployment of Russian troops in Sarajevo and are 
appealing to the UN Security Council to "postpone" the 
deployment of an additional Russian contingent in Bosnia. This 
is stated in a letter from Alia Izetbegovic, the Bosnian 
president, which was forwarded to the current president of the 
UN Security Council on Monday [28 February]. This document, 
which has not been officially issued yet, was obtained by an 
Itar-Tass correspondent. 
  "The behavior of the Russian soldiers after their arrival in 
Sarajevo has annoyed UN [words indistinct] in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since their arrival they have displayed 
their support for the aggressor. Attitudes which remind us of 
certain episodes in the past have been strongly demonstrated. 
Our people regard this as a provocation which could cause an 
incident," Izetbegovic pointed out. 
  "We do not endorse the arrival of additional Russian forces 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina," he stressed. "We believe that any such 
decision should be put off."

<F P=106> [Mikhail Shchipanov report under the "Our Commentary" </F>
rubric: "Moscow Is a Port of Five Presidents"] 
  [Text] Boris Yeltsin's kind invitation to his colleagues 
-- the presidents of the great powers -- to get together 
somewhere (in Moscow, for instance) to discuss peace settlement 
efforts in the former Yugoslavia has been up in the air so far. 
The initiative by Moscow, which was itself customarily invited 
to take part in other states' ambitious projects, has drawn a 
reserved reaction. One that borders on suspicion. History 
knows various sorts of congresses that were summoned by the 
great of this world to take stock of the results of wars and 
revolutions. Recently, however, such multilateral summits have 
taken place mainly under the UN Security Council aegis. But 
this time Yeltsin has invited world leaders to transcend the 
cozy framework of the United Nations, to say nothing of NATO, in 
order to organize a great-power get-together. 
  For the West, this initiative indeed is reminiscent of a 
frightening specter of a reversal in Russian policy, the 
renaissance of A. Gromyko's fancy idea that none of the world's 
political issues could be resolved without Moscow. In the past 
few years, the world seemed to have learned to do without 
Moscow, which is why the latter's claims to a role in the 
establishment of the world order, if read between lines, have 
been recognized as excessive. This is particularly surprising 
against the backdrop of behind-the-scenes promises that Russia 
will attend political debates of the Group of Seven on a 
permanent basis, if not become a full member of the elite world 
club. Apparently, it was still important that Russia was 
invited to acquire the status of a great power. This time 
around it seems as if Russia were inviting them. Dances to 
which ladies invite gentlemen are clearly not in vogue in the 
West. 
  How is it that the Americans and their allies are trying to 
circumvent Russia's proposal without arousing much fuss? There 
are a number of options. First of all, the West would try to 
speed up the emerging rapprochement between the Muslims and the 
Croats, that is, between participants in the conflict on whom 
Russia has only a limited influence. Hence, the idea of a 
comprehensive conference that would resolve all the problems 
under a package deal will die a natural death. Also possible 
are "disappointing" incidents, such as yet another spy scandal, 
that bring progress in Russian-American relations to naught. 
Finally, the idea of such a conference, if adopted by NATO, 
would have forced the North Atlantic bloc drastically to adjust 
its previously adopted line of conduct based on strength. 
Apparently, this would have deprived the Western alliance of 
the freedom of balancing on the verge of a power solution. That 
is to say, a solution the specter of which has ensured the 
West's complete domination in the Balkans for a number of 
months. Measures based on the use of force, such as yesterday's 
downing of Serb aircraft, will entirely exclude Russia from the 
Balkan concert. On the contrary, a conference would only have 
fixed its place in the future system of security guarantees for 
the post- Yugoslav countries.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Karaganov, deputy director of the Russian </F>
Academy of Sciences Europe Institute, under the "Opinion" 
rubric: "We Must Be the First at NATO's Doors"] 
  [Text] A political game has begun in Europe over the 
expansion of NATO. We have won the first round, but we are 
starting to lose the second round. And if we do not display 
boldness and initiative, we will lose the whole game. But in 
that case, those to blame for the failure will have to be sought 
not only in Brussels and Washington, but also in Moscow. 
  Having a fairly good knowledge of NATO and of the process of 
how a decision is adopted in the alliance, I do not believe that 
its expansion may significantly increase the almost nonexistent 
military threat from the West. Although, of course, as a result 
of the NATO and Russian borders being brought closer together, 
the positions of people who are used to seeing each other as 
potential adversariess will be strengthened, and mutual 
suspicion will grow. 
  But the main negative consequences will be of a political 
and 
even economic nature. Russian positions will be weakened in the 
bargaining over access to Western markets and the acquisition of 
investments. But the most important thing of all is that 
Russia's isolation will increase. We have no chance, in the 
foreseeable future, of joining the European Community, whose 
members will soon comprise the majority of European states. 
Even joining the free trade zone around the EC may even prove 
problematic for Russia -- not only because of the possible 
opposition of the West, fearing for its markets, but also 
because of protectionist trends in Russian policy. 
Protectionism is inevitable in political terms, and is even 
partially necessary in order to boost our nation's industry, 
but, given the principle of reciprocity in opening markets, it 
will make access to West European markets more difficult for us. 
  The CSCE -- the only major political organization in Europe 
where Russia is fully represented -- is becoming relatively 
weakering and most likely will not be able to become the nucleus 
of a European security system. 
  The expansion of NATO will weaken the CSCE still further. 
But the main thing is that the most promising channel of our 
cooperation with the West for the next few years -- the security 
sphere -- will be sealed off to a considerable extent. No 
matter what "compensation" -- for the expansion of the alliance 
-- our NATO neighbors may propose for us, they will most likely 
not be able to avert the reinforcement of Russian's 
military-political and political isolation. Russia will find 
itself to a significant extent "sealed up," and forced to expend 
forces and resources to break loose from the disadvantageous 
position, it will be doomed to be the disturber of European 
peace. Europe as well as Russia will suffer the damage. 
  In September-October of last year, it seemed that it would 
not p]rove possible to halt the mechanism of the admittance of 
four central and East European countries to NATO. But in the 
end, Russia's cooperation with forces in NATO countries which do 
not want the alliance to be expanded seems to have averted the 
inevitable. NATO adopted the idea of "Partnership for Peace." 
Moscow welcomed it. The "Partnership for Peace" sets forth four 
sometimes contradictory elements. First of all, there is NATO's 
attempt to gain time, look around, and conceal its lack of a 
long-term strategy. Second, the desire to satisfy both Russia 
on the one hand, and the countries of central and East Europe on 
the other hand, at the same time. Third, the attempt to block 
the entry of countries into NATO, placing them for an indefinite 
time in the "political antechamber." Fourth, there is a 
possible way of slowly assimilating these countries in NATO by 
establishing close cooperation between their military structures 
[voyennyye mashiny]. 
  Russia has three options for responsible [otvetstvennyy] 
actions. The first is not to join. The second is to formally 
join, but in reality not to display any special initiative. 
  There are a lot of arguments in favor of the first and 
second 
options: We cannot tune our military organizational development 
to NATO standards, and "partnership" will restrict our freedom 
of action. 
  But it must be clearly understood that our neighbors in 
central and East Europe will force their way through this door. 
Plans for cooperation are already being drawn up there and 
resources are being found. And if we remain apart, then in a 
year or two we will simply not have any arguments left for 
opposition. They will say to us: You have been given the 
chance. You have not taken it. So you have simply not made any 
effort toward common European military-political integration. 
Do not hinder those who are striving for it, and after about 
four years, NATO will be expanded. 
  But there is also a third option -- the only one which can 
block the expansion of the bloc. Russia should state: The 
expansion of the bloc may be a way of creating a collective 
security system in Europe, and, if its organizational 
development follows this path, it makes it its aim to join NATO 
ahead of the countries of central and East Europe. At the same 
time, Russia must put forward a military and military-political 
cooperation program which would enable us, and not our Western 
partners, to speak of insufficient will for cooperation. Only 
then will we have real and weighty arguments to counteract the 
expansion of NATO without Russia. 
  I foresee the counterarguments: Cooperation is costly, and 
conditions will be imposed on us. That is true, but the country 
is faced with the strategic threat of political and 
military-political isolation, and such cooperation is the most 
effective way of averting it. Tens of billions of rubles spent 
now would save tens of billions of dollars in the very near 
future. 
  There is another counterargument: What if NATO accepts the 
challenge and says -- join! I would answer: This is impossible 
in practical terms, but if it does happen, this means that 
Russia will achieve one of is basic foreign policy aims, and a 
collective security system will start being built in Europe.

  [Excerpts] Dear listeners, the Hebron massacre that cost 
the lives of dozens of Palestinians and wounded hundreds of 
others in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque on 25 February dealt a severe 
blow to the peace process in the Middle East. It is still not 
clear who committed this crime. The Israeli Government has set 
up a committee to look into the incident. However, it is 
totally clear that the Gaza-Jericho self-rule agreements are in 
danger after a lot of effort had been put into drawing them up. 
The PLO-Israeli talks were cut on all levels. The new round of 
Arab-Israeli talks in Washington that were due to take place 
today did not start. The delegations from Syria, Lebanon, and 
Jordan decided to discuss the implications of the current 
situation first; radical Arabs are demanding revenge. Tension in 
the occupied territories has increased, but it seems doubtful 
that terrorists will succeed in torpedoing the peace proces 
because this process is extremely important. [passage omitted] 
  In 'Arafat's opinion, international forces have to be called 
in to the protect the Palestinians. Moscow believes this to be 
a good idea. Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev stated that it 
was possible to send international observers to the area under 
UN supervision or the joint supervision of the United States and 
Russia. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The allegations that Russia has pledged to withdraw 
its troops from Estonia before August 31st this year "are 
unfounded," Alexander Udaltsov, RF Foreign Ministry official in 
charge of "the Baltic direction," told Interfax on Monday [28 
February]. 
  As he said, Russia "had indeed advanced such an initiative, 
basing on some of Estonia's promises, and stipulated certain 
conditions." "None of them have been met by the Estonian side, 
and therefore the issue of final dates for the withdrawal of 
troops remains open," the diplomat said. 
  Nevertheless, he noted, the Russian delegation is going to 
join the next round of Russian-Estonian talks, which opens in 
Tallinn on Tuesday, "in a constructive mood, and in the hope of 
reaching mutually-acceptable solutions to all the key issues." 
  Udaltsov confirmed that Russia continues to think it 
necessary to prepare for signing a basic treaty on troop 
withdrawal "in a package" with an agreement on social guarantees 
for Russian military retirees living in Estonia. 
  According to the diplomat, between Russia and Estonia "there 
are virtually no unresolved problems as regards the basic 
treaty." However, Estonia's stand on a number of fundamental 
issues concerning the destiny of military retirees is 
unacceptable to Russia. We hope that Tallinn will advance some 
new proposals to help resolve the situation," Udaltsov said.

  [Text] Moscow, Feb 28, BNS -- It is still premature at 
present to say that Russian troops will leave Estonia by Aug. 
31, a high-ranking Russian foreign ministry official said in a 
telephone interview with BNS today. The diplomat also referred 
to his country having no formal obligation to pull its units out 
from Estonia by that date. 
  Alexandr Udaltsev, official in charge of relations with the 
Baltics at the Russian Foreign Ministry, said Russia during the 
talks between the two countries had considered "the possibility 
to shift forward" the deadline for the troop withdrawal after 
Estonia, in his words, had failed to abide by certain promises 
it had given earlier. 
  "The issue, in particular, was about Estonia going to 
provide 
23 million U.S. dollars for the building of houses for the 
officers to be repatriated," Udaltsev said, adding that there 
had also been a number of other issues the deadline was linked 
to. "Not a single one of these has been fulfilled by the 
Estonian side," he said. 
  "In such a situation, naturally, the (final) date of the 
withdrawal is, at least, under question," he said. 
  He reminded that Russia had taken upon itself no obligation 
with respect to the pullout deadline. 
  "The topic of money, to our regret, no longer arises, since 
the Estonian party has shown itself as not being serious about 
it," he said. 
  Udaltsev said the main problem that bars way to an agreement 
on Russian troop withdrawal from Estonia now is the issue of 
signing a package of accords. Russia is insisting that 
agreements on social security guarantees for retired Russian 
military and their family members in Estonia be signed in one 
single package with the army pullout agreement. 
  "This is our initial position," Udaltsev said. He claimed 
that such a position on the issue was in compliance with rulings 
by international organizations, which demand the withdrawal of 
Russian units from the Baltics to take place "speedily, orderly, 
and according to the respective agreements." "Our partners in 
the Baltics for some reason or another are emphasizing only the 
first of these words, somehow forgetting about the two others," 
Udaltsev said. 
  The Russian diplomat said it was crucial that at the current 
round of talks, scheduled to begin in Tallinn Tuesday [1 March], 
"all attention would be focused" on social security guarantees 
for the some 11,000 retired Russian military and 30,000 members 
of their families, remaining in Estonia. 
  Udaltsev was pessimistic about the possibility that Estonia 
would grant permanent resident's status to these people, saying 
he feared the Baltic country was unlikely to "take a 
constructive approach" to the issue. 
  As another issue Russia views is preventing progress toward 
a 
solution of the topic of the withdrawal, Udaltsev mentioned 
reciprocal claims over property and damages. The diplomat said 
his country suggested a "zero option," when Russia would give up 
claims for compensation for the property it leaves behind in 
Estonia, while Estonia would not claim anything for damages 
inflicted by the Russian army on its soil. The two parties so 
far have failed to agree on a mutually acceptable formulation 
for the issue, he said. 
  Udaltsev's remarks today come as an indication that Russia 
is 
going to cancel the Aug. 31, 1994, deadline it suggested for the 
withdrawal of its troops from Estonia at negotiations late last 
year. Russia then said it would pull its remaining about 2,500 
troops from Estonia by that date, but soon declined to present 
to Estonia a detailed timetable for the withdrawal. Russia said 
failure at the talks to settle the issue of social welfare and 
guarantees for military pensioners was the reason of the delay. 
  Estonia at the beginning of this year declared agreeing with 
the troop withdrawal deadline offered by Russia.

  [Text] Russia and G-7 countries ended two days of talks in 
Germany on Sunday by pledging commitment to further dialogue and 
cooperation in the area of finances, a senior Finance Ministry 
official told Interfax on Monday. The Russian delegation led by 
Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin was involved in the G-7 
finance ministers' meeting there. 
  The delegation also held bilateral talks with finance 
ministers of the U.S., Germany and France as well as IMF 
Managing Director Michel Camdessus and representatives of the 
Paris and London Club of donor countries, the source said. More 
importantly, he said, the G-7 countries reaffirmed their plans 
for further cooperation with Russia despite the resignation of 
Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov. At the same time, it was pointed 
to the need to pay greater attention to social security matters. 
  For his part, Dubinin said that welcome as G-7 aid might be, 
Moscow would largely rely on its own resources. 
  The source said the G-7 finance ministers were invited to 
attend an EBRD-sponsored meeting in St Petersburg at the end of 
April intended to continue the dialogue. 
  On Russia-IMF talks in Moscow, the ministry official spoke 
of 
understanding reached on main issues though the two sides were 
still at odds on technicalities such as Russia's budget deficit. 
  The government plans a Rbl [rubles] 58 Tn [trillion] deficit 
this year. The Finance Ministry is ready to cover only Rbl 37 
Tn of the proposed figure at the cost of CBR credits which makes 
up about 5 percent of the GDP. Inflation will be reduced to 8-9 
percent by the end of 1994 (It ran at 22 percent in January) if 
the budget parameters are observed.

<F P=106> [Natalya Gorodetskaya report under the "North Caucasus" </F>
rubric: "Ruslan Aushev Is Ingushetia President by Wide Margin, 
According to Preliminary Data"] 
  [Text] Elections for president and parliament, and a 
referendum on the republic's draft constitution were held in 
Nazran on 27 February. Despite Moscow's indifference to the 
elections and referendum in Ingushetia and the fact that it 
provided no money from the budget to pay for them, the required 
billion rubles, according to Batyr Taldiyev, chairman of the 
republican district electoral commission, had been found in the 
republic's coffers. 
  Seventy-five polling stations opened at 0800 that Sunday 
morning where 105,000 voters (without taking into account the 
Ingush people who came from North Ossetia during the 
Ossetia-Ingushetia armed conflict) came to express their will. 
  The Ingushetia presidency was contested by current President 
Ruslan Aushev and Bamatgirey Mankiyev, a former state farm 
director. According to preliminary data, Ruslan Aushev won by a 
landslide. This had not been doubted in principle if one thinks 
about the small artillery preparation for the presidential 
elections two weeks ago in which Ruslan Aushev declined to run 
for the presidency, saying that his motive was his unwillingness 
"to bear responsibility for a repeat escalation of tensions 
owing to the ineptness of some politicians," because, in his 
view, "the current policy would lead to a new flare-up of the 
Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict this April or May." The Ingush 
president has lately been sharply critical of the Russian 
Federation temporary administration in the Ossetia-Ingushetia 
conflict zone because, he thinks, it puts the brakes on the 
implementation of Boris Yeltsin's edict on a phased return of 
Ingush refugees to four population centers of North Ossetia's 
Prigorodnyy Rayon. In the wake of the president's dramatic 
statement, the majority of eligible Ingush voters unanimously 
decided, as a snap poll showed, that Ruslan Aushev "cannot be 
excused from the president's post, and he cannot go against the 
will of the people." He collected 70,000 votes in his support. 
  Ruslan Aushev voted yesterday for the republic's draft 
constitution and for 27 deputies for parliament. Mr. Aushev did 
not vote for president and vice president, thinking that "voting 
for himself is unethical." 
  The new president is to meet soon with the head of North 
Ossetia. The question of a possible meeting had already been 
taken up at the experts level. True, negotiations about the 
return of Ingush refugees to North Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon 
would hardly be a simple matter because North Ossetia President 
Akhsarbek Galazov, who had the idea for the meeting, stated that 
the problem of normalization of relations between the republics 
is being forced into a blind alley in which one of the sides 
(implying the North Ossetia side) is being pressured.

  [Text] At a meeting of members of the Cabinet of Ministers, 
North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov said he was ready for 
dialogue with Ingushetia President Ruslan Aushev. He said: We 
need to implement the presidential decree and the decision by 
the Russian Government on returning refugees to their places of 
abode on the territory of North Ossetia and Ingushetia. Galazov 
categorically ruled out the possibility of granting additional 
powers to the interim administration on the territory of North 
Ossetia and Ingushetia and, for the first time, called for the 
lifting of the state of emergency regime on part of the 
territory of North Ossetia.

February] against the ruling of the Shchyolkovo District Court, 
Moscow Region. 
  The court canceled the election result in the electoral 
district where Zhirinovskiy won the December 12 elections. The 
reason for the ruling is that a Yabloko bloc candidate resigned 
from the election race in favor of the Russia's Choice candidate 
but his name remained in the electoral bulletin.

  [Text] On 28 February, Anton Buteyko, adviser to the 
Ukrainian president on international affairs, commented on 
Leonid Kravchuk's visit to the United States to a UNIAN 
correspondent. In particular, Anton Buteyko said: "There is a 
change for the better in the attitude to Ukraine on the part of 
United States and other Western states. Previously they were 
interested only in the situation concerning nuclear weapons, 
whereas now they are interested in full-scale economic 
cooperation and assistance for Ukraine in connection with the 
economic crisis. The main aim of the visit is to raise both 
countries' economic relations to a new level. It is expected 
that a number of agreements will be signed: on the legal basis 
of Western investments, avoiding double taxation, and statements 
on economic and trade relations. Issues connected with 
Ukraine's fulfillment of the START I Treaty and with making the 
mechanism of granting American aid more concrete are also to be 
discussed. A meeting is planned with the leadership of the 
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Their 
investments are to be included in the Ukrainian reforms."

<F P=106> [Report by Bohdan Kushnir, MOLOD UKRAYINY special </F>
correspondent: "A Sad Finale"] 
  [Text] The trial of Anatoliy Lysenko, Ukraine's Security 
Service major from Mostyska, is about to be concluded. It is 
expected that on Monday, the chairman of the Warsaw Military 
District Court, Colonel Kasparczak, will announce the sentence. 
  The finale will be sad, but not for Anatoliy Lysenko, 
because 
even the procurator demanded a minimal punishment -- five years 
imprisonment, whereas the Criminal Code article on espionage 
envisages between eight and 15 years imprisonment or capital 
punishment. Yet another small nuance. Perhaps, in anticipation 
that the judges may arrive at a "not guilty" verdict, the 
procurator asked that the episodes involving smuggler Janusz 
Bojarski be considered by the civilian court. This means that 
the spying case has burst like a soap-bubble. The Polish 
witnesses, driver Salata and military doctor Madej, confirmed 
that on that day, Lysenko was, indeed, taking his sick son for a 
medical consultation. During the court proceedings, there was 
an embarrassment: Mr. Salata felt unwell and was taken away by 
an ambulance. 
  Defense counsel Czeslaw Jaworski delivered a long speech. He 
spoke about Ukraine's cooperation in this case and stressed that 
Anatoliy Lysenko's acquittal would promote the establishment of 
good relations between Poland and Ukraine. 
  Anatoliy Lysenko's health is steadily deteriorating, and the 
few days that remain until Monday may be tragic for him. Even 
the court chairman emphasized that. 
  Let us wait and see what happens on Monday....

  [Text] Kiev--The trial of Major Anatoliy Lysenko, a staff 
member of the Mostiska customs house of the Security Service of 
Ukraine [SBU], continued in Warsaw on 28 February. Lysenko is 
accused of espionage. The prosecutor is demanding a five-year 
prison sentence for Lysenko. 
  Asked by a UNIAN correspondent to comment on the "Lysenko 
case", SBU Chairman Yevhen Marchuk said: "We have been trying 
for a long time now not to make any comment at all on this 
regrettable incident in mutual relations between our two 
neighboring, friendly states. I would like to say only that SBU 
Major Anatoliy Lysenko has nothing to do with our intelligence. 
He had no mission and went to Poland with his wife and children 
to attend to personal matters. The only thing that he may be 
rebuked for is that he went abroad without having waited for the 
SBU leadership's consent, thus acting in breach of service 
discipline. Our view is that the Polish special services' 
actions with respect to Lysenko were instigated by someone else: 
There probably are certain forces in Poland that do not want 
rapprochement between our friendly people. Nevertheless, we 
hope common sense will prevail".

  [Excerpt] The press service of Ukraine's border troops has 
denied reports by some Ukrainian newspapers that Russia is 
allegedly building a so-called Berlin Wall at the border between 
Belgorod and Sumy and Kharkov oblasts. As a rule, there is no 
smoke without fire. So, a scan of the Russian press has 
straightaway made it evident that this information arose from 
the head of the Belgorod Oblast administration's resolution on 
steps to implement the law of the Russian Federation of 1 April 
1993 on the Russian Federation's state border. This resolution 
envisages the establishment of a border zone up to 5 km deep on 
the territories of a number of Belgorod Oblast rayons, with the 
depth of the zone to be measured from the former administrative 
border between the Russian Federation and the Ukraine, and the 
introduction of a border regime from as early as 1 January 1994. 
  So what is it that Russia is building? 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Regrettably, we failed to 
obtain information from officials, as both the leadership of the 
Grayvoron border post and Belgorod border detachment declined 
interviews. The builders, however, were more open. 
  [Unidentified interviewee] The construction of a customs 
passage between Ukraine and Russia is under way here. It is a 
complex of dwellings for border guards and border posts for the 
passage of motor transport. 
  [Correspondent] How intensive is the work being done here? 
  [Interviewee] Very intensive. 
  [Correspondent] When will you have to finish it? 
  [Interviewee] Well, some time at the end of March or 
beginning of April. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Yesterday, President Leonid Kravchuk received Ms. 
(Anne Leuvergaunt), personal representative of French President 
Francois Mitterand. The visit came as a result of a recent 
telephone conversation between the Ukrainian and French 
presidents. Its purpose is to determine specific programs of 
cooperation between our countries. The meeting was attended by 
Michel Peissik, French ambassador in Ukraine. 
  Leonid Kravchuk presented his ideas about the development of 
Ukrainian-French relations. The Ukrainian president and the 
French president's personal representative agreed on a mechanism 
for devising and implementing specific projects and proposals 
that will later become the groundwork for negotiations soon to 
be conducted by a Ukrainian delegation that will visit Paris. 
Leonid Kravchuk reconfirmed his official invitation to French 
President Francois Mitterrand to visit Ukraine at a time 
convenient for him.

<F P=106> [Undated "Statement by the Ukrainian Presidential and </F>
Cabinet of Ministers Press Service"] 
  [Text] During a meeting with representatives of the mass 
media organized at the request of Radio "Liberty" and the 
[German] magazine DER SPIEGEL, Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk, briefing the journalists on the political situation in 
Ukraine in connection with the forthcoming elections to power 
structures at all levels, said that he considered his 
participation in the early presidential elections set for 26 
June 1994 inexpedient. 
  President Leonid Kravchuk justified his idea by the 
insufficient time for holding elections at all levels. It 
cannot be ruled out that the process of election and formation 
of supreme bodies of legislative and executive power may go 
beyond the time assigned for it and may overlap the course of 
early presidential elections and elections to local organs of 
power. This may lead to a vacuum of power, when the old Supreme 
Council is no more, a new one is not yet in existence, and 
Ukraine's Supreme Council, which might take upon itself the 
entire executive power, has not yet been formed. In this 
situation, the president alone may actually fulfill state 
functions. If he also participates in elections at that time, 
executive structures may collapse and control may be totally 
lost. This is the determining argument. 
  In view of the fact that the idea expressed in the 
aforementioned interview is being ambiguously commented upon 
both in Ukraine and abroad, the Ukrainian Presidential and 
Cabinet of Ministers Press Service points out that the position 
expressed by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk was due to 
precisely that specific situation in the life of our society and 
state that took shape today and to its possible development in 
the near future.

  [Text] At his own initiative, President Kravchuk met with 
directors of nuclear power plants [AES]. How do the plants work 
at this difficult time of deficits and meager funding? Will 
they manage to keep afloat? These were the question that 
worried the president. At the beginning of the meeting, 
Kravchuk said that nuclear power plants are Ukraine's salvation 
today. This phrase became the leading idea of the hour-long 
meeting. The meeting was attended by Directors Volodymyr 
Bronnykov, from the Zaporizhzhya AES; Volodymyr Korovkin, the 
Rivne AES; and Viktor Sapronov, the Khmelnytska AES. After 
outlining the situation at the stations, they centered on two 
issues -- the drain of qualified experts and nuclear fuel 
supplies. The experts are fleeing to Russia, where salaries are 
much higher. As a temporary solution to this problem, the 
station managers asked the president to help reduce by 10 
percent the income tax for AES key professionals -- something 
that was done for coal miners. With the moratorium on the 
development of nuclear engineering being lifted, the industry 
got its second wind. Substantial credits are about to come from 
abroad. But how are we supposed to repay them? Should we pay 
with ecologically clean electric energy, a deficient commodity 
for Ukraine itself, or by transferring ownership of our atomic 
facilities to international companies? The solution of those 
complex questions requires profound analysis, the president 
said. Also discussed was the issue of whether Ukraine should 
have its own so-called nuclear fuel cycle that would consist of 
extracting, processing, enrichment of uranium, manufacturing of 
fuel rods, and burial of nuclear waste. After all, Ukraine has 
its own uranium. But is the country in a position to manage 
this today? 
  Volodymyr Bronnykov presented a report on a project to build 
U.S.-licensed dry fuel waste warehouses. Viktor Safronov 
briefed those present on experience gained from cooperation with 
foreign partners in providing the stations with modern 
equipment. Volodymyr Korovkin talked about the successful 
handling of the problem caused by the karst layer under the 
Rivne AES. 
  As a UKRINFORM correspondent reported, the meeting was quite 
useful and fruitful. Its final result was the president's edict 
on urgent measures related to nuclear power engineering.

  [Text] Ukrainian Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy 
has instructed the ministries of communications and power 
engineering and Ukraine's TV and Radio Company to resume 
broadcasting TV programs in full throughout the territory of 
Ukraine. This decision was taken in response to requests to the 
Cabinet of Ministers by citizens. 
  I would like to recall that since the end of last year, all 
TV channels have only worked in the evening due to the energy 
shortage. An exception was made for the duration of the winter

<F P=106> [N. Gavrileva report on news conference given by President </F>
of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov with unidentified correspondents; place 
and date not given: "Edict No. 1 Is Not Yet Ready"] 
  [Text] The second news conference of the president of 
Crimea was held after his visits to Kiev and Moscow. Because Yu. 
Meshkov had granted KRYMSKAYA PRAVDA a lengthy interview on his 
working trip to Russia, there were few questions on this subject 
from the assembled journalists. 
  [Question] I would like, all the same, to get an answer from 
you: What are the main results of the visit? 
  [Meshkov] That to which we had aspired for several years was 
accomplished: preservation of the unity of the economy of the 
Republic of Crimea and Russia. All our problems met with the 
requisite understanding and the maximum possible support, and 
preliminary agreements were reached, and all that remains is to 
implement them. The main thing is that we are switching from 
declarations to action. I believe that we will all perceive the 
results of this switch very soon. The Republic of Crimea enjoys 
most favored nation status in Russia. 
  For example, specialists of the former Fourth Administration 
are prepared to supply the necessary equipment and make 
specialists available for medical treatment, primarily of 
children. I hope that they will be here next week to train our 
medical personnel on the spot. 
  [Question] Does the invitation to Ye. Saburov to take the 
office of vice premier indicate that you do not have your own 
team? 
  [Meshkov] Issues need to be decided to the maximum benefit 
of 
the Republic of Crimea. Appointing this person to this office is 
of the maximum benefit today. 
  [Question] And what will this "march from the Varangians to 
the Greeks" cost Crimea? 
  [Meshkov] A purely symbolic amount inasmuch as he is 
bringing 
everything necessary with him. 
  [Question] What will the directions of the economic reforms 
in Crimea be? 
  [Meshkov] The traditional ones--an equalization of the 
system 
of civil legislation in order that there be a legal foundation 
for the unity of our economies. We cannot ignore the processes 
already under way in Russia and which will necessarily take 
place in Ukraine. 
  [Question] What kind of mechanisms will be engaged for 
introducing the ruble in Crimea, and will it be introduced 
before summer? 
  [Meshkov] The problem of the use of the ruble in Crimea has 
preliminarily already been resolved, and the techniques and 
procedures will be determined later. It is vitally important 
that the matter be resolved before the start of the resort 
season. 
  [Question] What was Russia's attitude toward the request for 
the allocation of money for the program of the return of the 
Crimean Tatars? 
  [Meshkov] The application was accepted, and I know that 
there 
is the most heavyweight resolution possible in Russia. Actual 
names? We should best wait for the specific results. 
  [Question] People say: "A friendly calf suckles two 
mothers." 
May it be considered, following your visit to Moscow, that we 
have opted for one "mother"? Will we not lose out--after all, 
Clinton has promised Ukraine sizable assistance. 
  [Meshkov] I do not know whether the word "friendly" is 
compatible with the image that journalists have created for me. 
Ties only to Russia? Russia looks most favorably both on Crimea 
in general and on a solution of questions of the Crimean economy 
in particular, which, unfortunately, cannot yet be said of the 
persons who represent the Ukrainian economy, if there still is 
such. But this does not mean a demonstrative severance of 
economic ties to Ukraine; on the contrary, we will have more 
opportunities for expanding them. 
  [Question] Did you notify the president of Ukraine in any 
form of the trip to Moscow? 
  [Meshkov] No. It was a working visit for the resolution of 
specific economic problems--this did not go beyond the framework 
of pure economics, and for this reason I shall not be reporting 
on the work that was done to the president of Ukraine. 
  [Question] When will your apparatus be formed, and who will 
be a part of it? 
  [Meshkov] We have abandoned the word "apparatus," we prefer 
to speak of an "administration." Our principle is minimum 
composition with maximum professionalism. It now consists of two 
professors and the same number of generals--each a specialist in 
his own field. The comments in respect to the contacts that have 
been made by employees of the administration outside of Crimea 
have been more than positive. There have already been comments 
at the international level also. 
  We are taking the path of a minimum number of employees and 
maximum provision with energy and accounting equipment. Problems 
of communications and accounting equipment have been resolved 
with Russia, and this will signify unilateral assistance to the 
Republic of Crimea free of charge. Salaries are more than 
modest, and I tell each member of staff that they will lose out 
financially by switching to the administration. 
  [Question] There are rumors in Crimea concerning a new 
appointment at the Crimea Television and Radio Company.... 
  [Meshkov] It is impermissible for state structures to be 
used 
to propagandize one's own personal beliefs. 
  [Question] Explain the situation involving the black 
Lincoln. 
  [Meshkov] [laughs] I learn about all the "movements" of the 
black Lincoln from the press. There has been no conversation 
with those intending to make a gift of it. 
  [Question] Is there a mechanism for permanent contacts with 
the 
Government of Russia? 
  [Meshkov] Yes, Crimea has been allocated... no, I shall not 
say yet. The mechanism is this: Trade and economic missions of 
the Russian Federation and also of its components--Krasnodar and 
Stavropol Krays and Rostov-na-Donu--will be opened in Crimea, 
and ours, in Russia; and also personal contacts, which were 
generated at the time of the visit. 
  [Question] Will the administration of the president not 
increase the bureaucratic machinery--and how will its appearance 
affect the size of the government? 
  [Meshkov] I believe that this will signify a sharp reduction 
in bureaucratic structures. I hope for a qualitative improvement 
in work--of both the administration and the government. 
  [Question] GOLOS UKRAINY reported that you were received 
neither by B. Yeltsin nor V. Chernomyrdin, and KOMSOMOLSKAYA 
PRAVDA wrote that you were greeted in Kiev by two young persons 
unknown.... 
  [Meshkov] A meeting had been arranged, but Boris 
Nikolayevich's illness prevented it taking place. The contacts 
with Zhirinovskiy were not planned. In Kiev the meeting was 
modest, as modest as could be; the negotiations took place in a 
friendly, but official atmosphere, and tension was sensed on 
both sides. Subsequently it was dispelled, and the discussion 
became more specific. But it simply could not be compared with 
the meeting in Moscow--in terms either of level or quality. 
Heaven and earth. 
  [Question] You have declared repeatedly that the Republic of 
Crimea will be a guarantor of a restoration of the rights of the 
Crimean Tatar people. What do you understand by these words? 
  [Meshkov] Primarily observance of the entire volume of civil 
rights that are declared and upheld by the international 
community. The Republic of Crimea is responsible to its 
citizens. We sought 50 billion and obtained a positive 
resolution. I can confirm that the undertakings in respect to 
compensation for loss must be fulfilled, but not individually 
but on a legal basis. 
  [Question] What is your attitude toward men with shoulder 
boards and their social protection? Will a committee for 
servicemen be formed under the auspices of the president? 
  [Meshkov] Protection--to the extent that is guaranteed any 
citizen of the Republic of Crimea, particularly those with 
shoulder boards inasmuch as they are in the service of the 
state. As for a committee, I cannot yet say; it is not, I 
believe, a question of a committee but of the attitude toward 
the problems of servicemen, and they are being tackled, for 
example, by various structures, to which we have appealed with a 
request for assistance in the construction of housing for 
officers. 
  [Question] What kind of interaction do you have currently 
with the Council of Ministers, and who was in charge of Crimea 
during your week's absence? 
  [Meshkov] Normal, working interaction, except for the 
deplorable events you witnessed following the proclamation of 
the election results. I was not expecting this, to be honest. 
But we have negotiated the first difficult times, and the 
government has, on the whole, rendered the necessary support. 
Control of the situation was not lost, and in addition all the 
preliminary output of the previous negotiations in Kiev was 
continued. The duties of chairman of the Council of Ministers 
are being discharged--in conscientious and skilled fashion--by 
A. Franchuk. 
  [Question] Is a reform of the local authorities--the system 
of soviets--contemplated any time soon? If so, in which 
direction? 
  [Meshkov] This question has been determined by life itself, 
and it must be decided not in the plane of the elimination of 
the representative bodies but in the plane of changes in their 
purposes and tasks. This will mean, obviously, more professional 
and fewer representatives of the populace together with the 
local administration. If there are county councils in 
respectable old England, they are ordained for us by God himself. 
  [Question] Your understanding of freedom of speech? 
  [Meshkov] A journalist must do his professional duty: convey 
information, not express his personal viewpoint and on the 
strength of this invite people who will confirm it. I am 
prepared for the most impartial criticism. But what do the 
newspapers attributing to a person words he has never spoken 
have in common with this? 
  [Question] Has there been Edict No. 1, and to what is it 
devoted? 
  [Meshkov] There is a silent competition under way in the 
administration currently for the right to prepare the text of 
the first edict. The team handling interethnic matters will be 
the winner, it seems. 
  [Question] Judging by your interview in KRYMSKAYA PRAVDA, 
you 
are not disposed to reveal yourself completely, thereby evoking 
associations with the party nomenklatura, which you so hate. Is 
this an accident or a fledgling tradition? 
  [Meshkov] It is necessary to resort to Aesopian language in 
cases where your interlocutor does not give you the right to 
convey the content of the interview. At the same time it is 
improper not to answer the questions of a journalist inquiring 
after the content of the interview. Let us consider that this 
will not become a tradition.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "A Meeting of the Crimean Supreme </F>
Council Presidium"] 
  [Text] The Crimean Supreme Council Presidium has held a 
meeting. Opening it, speaker of the Crimean parliament Nikolay 
Bagrov said that the situation on the peninsula is complex and 
that "we need to create normal conditions for the president's 
work." Bagrov negatively assessed Ukraine's Supreme Council's 
decision to hold elections to local state authorities on 26 
June, the same date as the [Ukrainian] presidential elections. 
Bagrov proposed that this question be raised at the session of 
the Crimean parliament. The proposal by Viktor Bobylev, a member 
of the Presidium, that the moratorium on holding a referendum on 
the Crimean Republic's independence be lifted did not meet with 
support. 
  The Crimean parliament's speaker touched upon the discussion 
at the session of the question of forming the Crimean Republic's 
budget. "If, today, the city [as published] must receive an 
income of 700 billion karbovantsi, the question of the budget 
will not be at all simple," Bagrov pointed out. "I very much 
fear that once Ukraine has given us the chance to form our own 
budget independently and does not give us anything, we will not 
be able to survive." 
  Asked by journalists whether the Crimea will be able to 
become a subject of international law, Bagrov replied: "This 
topic must be removed from the agenda. Economic relations are 
one thing, but political relations are something entirely 
different." 
  Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov took part in the work of the 
Crimean Supreme Council Presidium.

<F P=106> [Interview with S.A. Yefimov, director of the Center for </F>
Regional Development of Crimea, by O. Kulakovskaya, under the 
"Economics: The Market and Reforms" rubric; place and date not 
given: "Shall We Begin From the Beginning?"] 
  [Text] Slowly hurrying--this is probably how one 
would characterize the movement the current government of Crimea 
is constantly attempting to carry out in the fight to attain 
Crimean statehood. Have the main reference points changed? 
Will we not have to go back to the beginning in connection with 
our establishment of the institution of the presidency? These 
questions constitute the leading theme of conversation between 
our correspondent and S.A. Yefimov, director of the Center for 
Regional Development of Crimea. 
  [Kulakovskaya] Sergey Alekseyevich, a certain stage in the 
lives of Crimeans has been completed. We have "undergone" a 
presidential election and demonstrated a high level of civic 
self-consciousness. Exhibiting a "high-flown style," we have 
passed the examination for statehood. But our problems have not 
become fewer as a result of this. In fact, with regard to 
problems demanding immediate resolution.... 
  [Yefimov] Indeed, construction of the Crimean state has 
entered its concluding phase. A president has been elected. In 
the next two or three months, now in accordance with the 
Constitution in effect, a government will be formed and for the 
first time elections to the Crimean Supreme Council will be held. 
  As far as the activity of the Crimean president is 
concerned, 
here two paths are possible. The first is to begin everything 
on a clean slate, as they say, considering that nothing existed 
prior to this; the second--to provide a continuity with respect 
to whatever positive undertakings have already managed to be 
achieved. I must note that the president of Crimea did not 
permit himself to be lured away by the first path--extremely 
advantageous to official Kiev, but instead chose the second, a 
path firmly sanctioned in the practice of the world community. 
  [Kulakovskaya] Well, since we are talking about continuity, 
one basic question in this regard is the matter of reconciling 
budget relations with the Ukrainian side. An agreement on this 
matter was signed in December between the Governments of Ukraine 
and Crimea. This evoked feelings approaching euphoria even as 
early as the days of the presidential campaign, as if to say--we 
have succeeded in resolving a key issue, now.... Well, what 
does happen now? 
  [Yefimov] Well now, for the hundredth time we can assert 
that the Ukrainian leadership has never learned to fulfill its 
obligations. Mr. Zvyahilskyy signs an agreement with Crimea 
with one hand, and with the other--the draft Law on the Ukraine 
Budget for 1994, which automatically cancels the mutual 
agreements. 
  Naturally, the Ukrainian Supreme Council is also acting as 
if 
no such agreement were concluded, and has secured this in the 
Law on the Ukraine Budget--this in spite of the fact that the 
agreement was concluded in accordance with the Law of Ukraine on 
demarcation of powers between Crimea and Ukraine. 
  So what do we see as the result? The Government of Ukraine 
is not fulfilling the obligations it has assumed. It is 
violating its very own laws and instigating the parliament to do 
the same. We see a not very pretty picture. I believe the 
people of Crimea must be aware of this shameful practice on the 
part of Ukraine's upper echelons of power. 
  The question of mutual budget relations is a key issue for 
Crimea, for without it virtually no transformations in the 
economic sphere can take place. It is precisely for this reason 
that this was a topic of discussion at the first meeting between 
the presidents of Crimea and Ukraine. As a fundamental issue, 
it will remain a topic of subsequent talks. The Government of 
Ukraine must immediately guarantee fulfillment of this 
agreement, and with the aim of ensuring an integral system of 
administration and financing, it must change the jurisdiction of 
the State Price Inspectorate, Tax Inspectorate, and Control and 
Auditing Directorate of the Ukraine Ministry of Finance for the 
Crimean Republic, so that these fall under the appropriate 
structures of the government of Crimea. 
  [Kulakovskaya] Aside from budget relations, as of today we 
see that property relationships are not settled either.... 
  [Yefimov] Quite right. This is a second key issue that 
requires immediate examination. We have to recognize that the 
problem of demarcation of property between Ukraine and the 
Crimean Republic remains an open one to this day partially 
because the Crimean Supreme Council made an unfortunate decision 
at one time. The necessary step was not to ask the Cabinet of 
Ministers of Ukraine, but rather to draw up an appropriate 
document ourselves and then work on settling aspects in dispute. 
This was not done, unfortunately. For half a year now, the 
question has been in a state of suspension. The Ukrainian side 
is making every effort to "shake it up." 
  [Kulakovskaya] Well, this is understandable--he who is 
stronger dictates the conditions.... 
  [Yefimov] I believe that any relationship, especially one on 
the state level, must be built on the basis of mutual 
understandings. The entirety of world practical experience 
shows this. It is impossible to attain anything good when one 
ignores the interests of the other side. The results of the 
presidential election in Crimea is a clear example of this. You 
cannot show disdain for the will of the people. Even the most 
ultranationalistic forces of Ukraine are simply obliged to deal 
with it. 
  [Kulakovskaya] Yes, but they are not accustomed to dealing 
with it.... 
  [Yefimov] It does not matter--they must be trained. The 
Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers is always attempting to "squash" 
the issue of demarcation of property when it examines lists of 
facilities. No, it is necessary here to look for common 
approaches, common principles, according to which we can act. 
One of these, which I proposed and which found support in the 
government of Crimea: that all facilities located in the 
territory of Crimea and subject to privatization in accordance 
with Ukrainian legislation in effect constitute property of the 
Republic of Crimea. Funds obtained from privatization must not 
be dissipated--they must serve to promote the welfare of the 
people of Crimea, being directed toward the implementation of 
one socioeconomic program or another. 
  All facilities operating primarily in the interests of the 
region must also be placed within the category of property of 
the Crimean Republic. While for those facilities that do not 
fall under these categories, mutually agreed upon decisions must 
be taken. Here is where a facility-by-facility approach is 
possible. 
  [Kulakovskaya] What if talks on these issues do not yield 
positive results? 
  [Yefimov] In that event, the Supreme Council of Crimea must 
independently draw up a document respecting demarcation of state 
property. In doing so, it will confirm the zero-option decision 
adopted in 1991. We must be consistent in our actions. We have 
shown respect and proposed joint efforts, but if we see no 
movement in response, we have the right to take independent 
steps. 
  [Kulakovskaya] But will these be acknowledged as 
constitutional? 
  [Yefimov] Absolutely. This is purely a question of 
economics. Many in Kiev are finally finding it necessary to rid 
themselves of nationalistic narrowmindedness and avoid confusing 
separatism with bread. 
  [Kulakovskaya] Sergey Alekseyevich, do you think the 
presidential election, having convincingly secured the statehood 
of Crimea, gives us the right to be more persistent in looking 
after our interests? 
  [Yefimov] Without a doubt. Crimea has today become a more 
active entity, deservedly acquiring this right. As far as to 
what extent it will be exercised--I will not be the judge. But 
the realm of prospective opportunities has broadened 
significantly.

<F P=106> [Interview with V.I. Korobov, chairman of the Social Justice </F>
Party of Crimea, by L. Pirozhenko, under the "Parties and Social 
Movements" rubric; place and date not given: "Another Party"] 
  [Text] The Social Justice Party of Crimea (SJPC), 
registered as No. 13 by the Ministry of Justice of Crimea on 7 
February 1994, has been presented in the conference hall of the 
Crimean Consumers Union. 
  [Korobov] The goal of our activity is to protect the 
economic, political, and social interests of all citizens of 
Crimea, regardless of nationality, religious beliefs, or social 
affiliation. Here we are primarily concerned with the socially 
unprotected segments of society and those engaged in the 
production and processing of agricultural output, those who are 
striving to saturate the consumer market of the republic with 
essential commodities and foodstuffs. 
  [Pirozhenko] Vladimir Ilich, V.M. Negulyayev and G.N. 
Prigornitskiy were selected as your deputies. In the Presidium 
we have A.V. Oleynikov, N.M. Bramatkin, and other well-known 
people who work in the system of the Crimean Consumers Union. 
Does this not mean that the SJPC is an occupationally 
affiliated party, that is, affiliated with workers in the 
consumer cooperatives? 
  [Korobov] No, it does not. The party charter states quite 
definitively that our party is established not according to an 
occupational principle, but rather a territorial one. Any 
individual can become a member who agrees with its program and 
is prepared to support and implement it. Though it is true 
indeed that consumer cooperative workers brought the party into 
existence-- lower-echelon consumer cooperative workers. 
  [Pirozhenko] How large is the SJPC membership? 
  [Korobov] Right now we have over a thousand applications, 
and they continue to come in. Primary party organizations have 
been established in all the rayons. This demonstrates that our 
new organization enjoys mass popular support and that its aims 
and objectives conform to the interests of the workers. The 
Social Justice Party of Crimea intends to become a party of the 
parliamentary variety, joining the membership of the Supreme 
Council. It will support the programs of other parties and join 
with them in unified blocs if their social objectives are 
similar.

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Yavorskyy: "A Man of Uncommon </F>
Intelligence and Weak Will"] 
  [Excerpt] A man is judged by his deeds and not by his 
words, because it is a man's deeds that reveal his nature. 
  Keeping this in mind, let us try to portray the nature of 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. This is important, because 
he personifies the entire current Ukrainian leadership -- the 
union between democrats and postcommunists. As everybody knows, 
the former as well as the latter had been rejecting the idea of 
Ukrainian statehood before the "reconstruction," and became 
advocates of independence only under the pressure of 
circumstances -- the collapse of the USSR. Therefore, knowing 
who Kravchuk really is, we will know where Ukraine is going, and 
what we should expect in the future. 
  President Kravchuk seems to be a man who is able to view 
issues comprehensively. One should be particularly alarmed by 
his speeches, in which he consistently explains his opinions, 
covering any acute issues with apt metaphors and arguments, as a 
result of which the issue no longer seems as acute as before. 
  Many people ask themselves: Why do people like the 
president's speeches? The answer is simple. There is a certain 
probability in his words. This is merely a probability, not the 
truth. Additionally, it is hard to avoid the feeling that his 
reasoning is meant to be admired. Moreover, it is meant to 
satisfy all people. 
  Therefore, while estimating the president, an open-eyed man 
experiences a harassing duality of feelings: sympathy on the one 
hand and dissatisfaction on the other. The first feeling is 
induced by the president's intelligence, the second one -- by 
the lack of clear goals. 
  The events of the last three years have convinced many 
people 
of the certain incongruity and even vulnerability of Kravchuk. 
It must be pointed out that this incongruity is characteristic 
of the entire current leadership of Ukraine, whose best 
representatives, though they represent the right way of 
thinking, actually lack an essential element of spirit -- the 
ability to see the main goal and consistently pursue it. This 
is why estimates of various democratic or postcommunist leaders 
imply an opinion about their affectation and even insincerity. 
Despite their words, suspicions occur that those are not their 
words, that their beliefs are far from these words, and that 
none of them will keep or is even able to keep their promises. 
Such a feeling is induced, first of all, by the lack of the 
above-mention element. 
  There is no doubt that this element is the strength of will. 
Kravchuk and the entire democratic-postcommunist Ukrainian 
leadership lack strength of will. This makes Ukraine's leaders 
incongruous and ephemeral. They resemble people who bargain at 
the market with a serious look but have no money in their 
pockets. 
  Summarizing the above, it can be said that Kravchuk has 
gifted, uncommon intelligence but also a very weak will. His 
activities in the offices of Supreme Council chairman and 
Ukrainian president have confirmed this. 
  Let us more carefully examine the internal mechanism of 
behavior of the current Ukrainian president. 
  All his "successes," which actually reduce to a masterful 
balancing of Ukraine's political temporariness, are exclusively 
based on his natural slyness and ability to predict people's 
moods. He bets everything on intensifying tactical steps and 
accomplishing superficial tasks, while avoiding resolution of 
any fundamental issues, which, of course, may lead to minor 
victories, but which will never result in a global victory. 
These are the typical deeds of a weak-willed man, who is afraid 
of everything great. 
  It is evident that the president does not have any 
state-building program. Since he does not know what he wants, 
what should he do, and where should he go; he is merely forced 
to respond to external stimuli. This is the only thing he does. 
  President Kravchuk's activities have explicitly testified to 
the fact that he is unable, and does not want, to accomplish 
great tasks connected with the development of the Ukrainian 
state. Probably, he does not even realize that this is an 
important matter. This is why he has neither a concept of state 
nor an approximate plan of action. A man who is not going to do 
anything does not need any plans. 
  Such an assessment of President Kravchuk is not groundless. 
The fact that he catastrophically neglects the factor of 
strength is significant. If someone wants to achieve something, 
he usually accumulates his strength. Any task is doomed to 
failure without strength. This relates to any task, 
particularly, the building of a state. 
  If the Ukrainian president realized the importance of 
strength in state-building processes, all of his energy would 
focus on forming such strength. This means that he would 
undertake intensive work aimed at increasing the number of 
people devoted to the idea of Ukrainian independence, that he 
would support -- at the state level -- all activities aimed at 
boosting patriotic attitudes, and that he would mercilessly 
terminate all antinational activities. In such a case, massive 
patriotic-educational work would be conducted in our country, 
and anti-Ukrainian propaganda would be banned. All this would 
have to be carried out within reasonable boundaries, respecting 
reality, however consistently and steadfastly. 
  As a matter of fact, the president would have to make a 
clear 
ideological choice, and, having divided the people into two 
sectors -- supporters and enemies of independent Ukraine -- he 
would bet on the first one. Understanding that the fate of the 
Ukrainian state would depend on the strength of the supporters 
of independent Ukraine, the president would make all possible 
efforts to strengthen them. A patriotically educated population 
is the foundation of a state; it is its force that creates and 
maintains a state. If there is no such foundation, there is 
also no sense to deal with such attributes of state as political 
system, economy, democracy, culture, and religion. 
  Meanwhile, Kravchuk completely ignores the main problem of 
Ukraine -- developing such strength, which means forming a great 
number of patriots, whose support could help resolve any 
problems. He attempts to build the state in a different way, 
which has been unknown in the history of the world -- not by the 
strength of united people, but by cunning, acrobatic diplomacy. 
  This has not given any positive results during the two years 
of Ukrainian independence, because it could not give any. 
Ukraine today resembles an amorphous social substance, all the 
spheres of which are ruined. There is no order, laws are 
ineffective, and nobody listens to anybody. No reforms are 
conducted. Everything is plunged into inactivity and the realm 
of daydreams. There can be only one answer to the question of 
who rules Ukraine -- inertia. 
  It is President Kravchuk who is responsible for this 
situation, because he has never had his own political line, but 
has always followed an average line of the entire society, not 
advocating the creative minority, but the inert majority. His 
willingness to make compromises kills any attempt to move 
forward. Therefore, there has been no such movement. The lack 
of movement has resulted in the current decay. 
  This is quite normal, since society can change, and 
therefore, develop, only if it adapts new ideas advocated by 
minorities or even separate individuals. The responsibility of 
a state leader is to select from new ideas the most suitable 
one, and to guide society in the right direction. A leader 
should steer society. He should not be an average voice of 
inoperative mass that does not have any intelligence, but only 
potential energy. 
  All that has been said above allows one to come to the 
conclusion that the activities of Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk are determined by two factors -- bright intelligence 
and weak will. The lack of a precise concept of state-building, 
the slyness of his policy, his willingness to make compromises, 
and neglecting the factor of strength are the results of these 
components. Knowing this, one can easily explain and predict 
every step of the president. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Speech delivered by Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb </F>
at a celebration meeting devoted to the Day of Fatherland's 
Defenders and the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus; place 
and date not given: "Our Future Is In Our Hands"] 
  [Text] Dear veterans! 
  Esteemed representatives of the Armed Forces! 
  Respected guests! 
  First of all, let me congratulate you on the occasion of the 
Day of Fatherland's Defenders and the Armed Forces of the 
Republic of Belarus! 
  There is hardly a family, even hardly a person in our 
republic, whose fates have not been connected in one way or 
another with the past war, with the Army, with the making of the 
Armed Forces. 
  Many times, our soil had been the scene of terrible battles 
for freedom and independence of the Fatherland. Such is the 
history. Many times, foreign invaders trod over our land and 
crop, set our towns and villages on fire. And every time, the 
path of the invading enemies was blocked by Fatherland's 
Defenders, by our valiant soldiers, guerrillas, and 
conspirators. The destiny of the Belarusian nation as well as 
those of other nations have often been determined on the banks 
of the Berezina river, alongside the gray Dnepr river, and by 
the walls of the Brest fortress. 
  Addressing our words of gratitude to older generations, and 
bowing our heads by the graves of the fallen and those dead of 
wounds and woes during the evil years of the war, we also draw 
conclusions for the present day. We should always remember how 
great was the price paid for our victory and freedom. 
Therefore, it is our holy duty to preserve and augment the 
glorious traditions of our ancestors. 
  Today our activity proceeds from our realities. The Republic 
of Belarus is an independent, sovereign state. A young state, 
too. Our state threatens nobody's security and builds its 
relations with all states on the basis of equal partnership and 
mutual respect, having clearly determined its neutral status 
that is being affirmed through practical actions. 
  While building up our tomorrow, we have to begin many things 
anew. At the current time, in an exceptionally important and, 
due to objective reasons, complicated period, we lay the 
foundations for a new economic union with Russia and other CIS 
countries, as well as strengthen our ties with the countries of 
far abroad. Belarus favors collective security, supports those 
good traditions which were established with Russia and other 
countries of the former USSR during the past decades. 
  Undoubtedly, we are all expecting improvements in all the 
spheres of our life. However, to achieve them, we must 
determine the ways out of the crisis and resolve many complex 
problems. Alas, many things -- due to various objective and 
subjective reasons -- are being resolved in an undesirable way. 
There is a very complex situation in the national economy. The 
national income, as compared to January-December last year [as 
published], decreased by 10 percent. The decrease in industrial 
production during 1993-94 in comparable prices amounts to 18.5 
percent. The situation in agriculture -- it should be openly 
admitted -- has become threatening. Immediate measures should 
be adopted there, and we will adopt them. 
  The issues of the upcoming sowing campaign have recently 
been 
discussed at the Supreme Soviet Presidium session. New 
possibilities of financial aid to the countryside have been 
found; some other problems will also be resolved. 
  With regard to our economy as a whole, we are principally 
committed to the orientation toward an economic union with 
Russia, toward a single ruble zone. I think that, given the 
current circumstances, this approach is reasonable. It is 
important to stabilize industry, give enterprises greater 
employment opportunities, and restore people's confidence in the 
future. 
  In today's activity of the Supreme Soviet, we give priority 
to the questions of the state political system: Introduction of 
the presidency and the nationwide elections of the president as 
a head of the state and executive power. The necessary draft 
laws have been prepared, and will be discussed during the 
current Supreme Soviet session. 
  The parliamentary opposition as well as certain political 
parties and movements urge early elections for the Supreme 
Soviet; they propose holding presidential elections next, and, 
then ultimately, adopting a new constitution. I believe that in 
this case we should expect an interim period of complete state 
uncontrollability. I think that I do not need to mention the 
consequences of such a period. 
  Esteemed representatives of the Armed Forces! The issues 
related to the building of the Army and the defense of the 
Republic of Belarus have always been given priority by the 
Supreme Soviet. 
  The current process of reforms in the Armed Forces tends not 
to disorganize the defense capability of the republic, but to 
bring this capability in line with the current political and 
economic situation of our young sovereign state. 
  There are many difficulties. What are their roots and 
origins? 
  The Belarusian people have been living in peace for the last 
50 years. It is a rare historical fact. However, due to 
well-known political processes, a change in the world outlook 
has occurred over the last two years. Along with it, a sense of 
honor for the destiny of the Fatherland has been lost to a 
certain extent. A very negative role has recently been played 
by political games, to which the Army was a hostage. Many of 
those who honestly attended to their military duties, have been 
brought down by a rush of accusations and insults. By unjust 
accusations and insults, I would like to emphasize. As a 
result, a fall in the prestige of the military service and work 
among the ranks followed. 
  Celebrating the professional holiday of servicemen, which is 
historically associated with the notions of manly valor, honor, 
and dignity, we also see those first results that were attained 
in the complex work of building the Belarusian Armed Forces. 
  Having declared its nonnuclear status and commitment to 
neutrality, Belarus has to eliminate these disproportions in a 
short time and benefit as much as possible from all that was 
inherited. Unfortunately, mistakes have been made here, too. 
  Having announced our move toward neutrality, we clearly 
realize that the desirable effect cannot be achieved quickly. 
Therefore, many politicians understand that one has to 
optimally make use of those circumstances, of those economic, 
political, social, and demographic situations that were attained 
during the existence of the USSR. 
  A well-considered approach by the Supreme Soviet and the 
government as well as a good attitude of our citizens to 
transformations in the military sphere have allowed us to 
prepare a legislative basis for resolving the tasks of the state 
defense and the creation of our own Armed Forces. 
  Over 30 laws have been worked out and adopted; the 
government 
has implemented over 60 normative documents. On this basis, it 
was possible to reduce the number of troops almost by half in 
two years, as well as to implement the principal structural 
transformations which were applicable to the situation and the 
capability of our state. 
  To picture the scale of this work, I will cite some figures. 
By November 1995, the republic should dismantle over 2,000 
tanks, about 1,500 combat vehicles, and over 500 aircraft. 
  We are for the strict fulfillment of international 
agreements. However, we also need an understanding on the part 
of other states which are interested in providing security to 
the European continent. Under the circumstances that have been 
globally changed -- I put it straightforwardly -- our republic 
alone is incapable of fulfilling those agreements. 
  We, undoubtedly, count on the predominance of the spirit of 
reality among the governments of Europe and the United States, 
as well as their financial and material participation in the 
resolution of these issues. 
  However, it is only a single, though very important, aspect. 
As the building of our statehood advances, new layers of very 
complex problems are uncovered. Therefore, while celebrating 
the day of Fatherland's Defenders and the Armed Forces, we also 
consult the righteousness of the adopted orientation with that 
part of our society, which is most competent in the military 
sphere. 
  I evaluate the situation in the Army, which was created by 
our joint efforts with the Ministry of Defense in the process of 
reforming and deeply reducing the troops, as a success. 
  The Supreme Soviet is deeply concerned today with the 
situation of servicemen and their families, as well as those 
pensioned or transferred to the reserve due to reforms in the 
Army. 
  The economic situation in the republic does not allow us to 
safeguard the proper level of social guarantees to the right 
degree. I will say even more -- for the time being, we are not 
able to provide our troops with satisfactory material and 
technical support. 
  The Supreme Soviet and the government are very concerned 
with 
the level of military discipline and the fall in the level of 
patriotic education of youth. 
  There are many problems. However, there are also good 
aspects. I think that we all, including the information media, 
should also see the good things. 
  I am sure, dear friends, that all those who served in the 
Army, and those who are serving today, as well as all the 
Belarusian citizens understand very well that our future is in 
our hands. 
  Let me congratulate you on the Day of Fatherland's Defenders 
and the Armed Forces. 
  I wish you good health and every success in mastering combat 
ability for the benefit of our Belarus! 
  Dear veterans! 
  I thank you for your contribution to the strengthening of 
our 
state independence and the education of the young generation. 
  I wish you happiness and joy for long years to come! 
  Congratulations, dear friends!

<F P=106> [Interview with Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb by </F>
Vital Tshygankov; place and date not given: "The Belarusian and 
Russian Prime Ministers Will Meet in Early March"] 
  [Text] During a recess at the Supreme Soviet session, 
journalists interviewed Mechyslaw Hryb, head of the legislature. 
  [Tsygankov] What is your attitude toward the proposal by one 
of the Russian Duma legislative factions about the political 
unification of Belarus with Russia? 
  [Hryb] This issue was never discussed -- either at the 
meeting of the prime ministers in Moscow or the 
Interparliamentary Assembly in Saint Petersburg. We are 
interested only in an economic union and a common ruble zone. I 
can assure you that no official circles ever considered the 
political union. 
  [Tsygankov] When will the Belarusian prime minister go to 
Moscow? 
  [Hryb] As is known, both prime ministers are ill now. Once 
they begin to recover, I think their meeting will actually take 
place. I talked with Kebich -- the government heads are 
planning to meet in early March. Viktor Chernomyrdin even 
called off his foreign visits.

  [Text] On 28 February, the Popular Movement of Belarus 
[NDB] held a news conference at the national press center, which 
was devoted to the recent visit of NDB representatives to 
Moscow. The conference was attended by People's Deputy Valeryy 
Tsikhinya, NDB Chairman Syarhey Haydukevich, and Mikalay 
Syarheyew, cochairman of the Slavic Assembly Belaya Rus. The 
participants in the news conference informed that they held 
meetings with leaders of all State Duma factions in Moscow. The 
purpose of the meetings was to learn the Russian legislators' 
opinion about an economic union of the CIS countries, a single 
ruble zone, and the political situation in Belarus. A number of 
questions related to economic cooperation and the 
reestablishment of ties was also discussed [passage indistinct]. 
He also stated that, regardless of political [word indistinct], 
the unification of monetary systems of Russia and Belarus is 
supported by all State Duma factions. It was also announced at 
the news conference that a joint session of the Belarusian 
Supreme Soviet and the Russian State Duma is planned for the 
future. Expressing his opinion about the amnesty to the 
participants in the Moscow events, Valeryy Tsikhinya said: "It 
is an act of good will and mercy, which was adopted under the 
new Russian Constitution." The conference also touched upon the 
possible introduction of the presidency in Belarus. V. 
Tsikhinya informed that 216 Supreme Soviet deputies support the 
presidential system of rule; the adoption of an appropriate 
document requires 232 votes. V. Tsikhinya expressed hope, 
however, that the 13th Supreme Soviet session proceedings on 1 
March will provide the sufficient number of votes. Presidential 
elections, in his opinion, will be held in June of this year.

  [Text] Former Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav 
Shushkevich in an interview to INTERFAX has spoken in favor of 
creating an electoral bloc of democratic forces in the republic. 
According to the ex-speaker, this bloc could consist of various 
social and political organizations, including the oppositional 
Belarusian Popular Front. Having suggested that he will 
actively participate in the formation of such a bloc, 
Shushkevich stated that for the time being, he does not intend 
to create a party of his own. It is necessary to urge early 
parliamentary elections, which were promised by the Supreme 
Soviet to the people some time ago, noted the ex-speaker.

  [Text] People's Deputy Stanislav Shushkevich held two 
meetings with workers in Mogilev this past Sunday [27 February]. 
The former parliamentary speaker sees early parliamentary 
elections as the way out of the current difficult situation. 
Touching upon the unification of monetary systems of Russia and 
Belarus, Stanislav Shushkevich spoke in favor of this agreement 
concluded on equal conditions without infringing upon the 
interests of our Republic. 
  The leaders of the local "Spring 94" bloc of democratic 
forces publicized an appeal to Stanislav Shushkevich, in which 
they requested that he put forward his candidacy for the post of 
Belarus' first president. This appeal was approved by the 
supporters of democratic parties.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andrzej Bortnowski, Polish military attache </F>
to Belarus, by Reserve Colonel G. Palchevskiy; place and date 
not given: "Andrzej Bortnowski: `My Task Is To Strengthen 
Friendship Between Our Armies'"] 
  [Excerpt] [Palchevskiy] During World War II, Belarus and 
Poland suffered heavy losses in population and material 
resources. We are now preparing to celebrate the 50th 
anniversary of Belarus' liberation from German fascist invaders 
and the 50th anniversary of the victory of Soviet people during 
the Great Patriotic War. Is Poland going to celebrate these 
events, too? Do Poles remember being liberated by the Soviet 
Army? 
  [Bortnowski] Yes, our nations suffered very heavy losses 
during that war. The memory of the fallen is sacred. Poles, 
undoubtedly, have not forgotten from where the deliverance from 
fascism came. In Poland, there are graves of Belarusians who 
fought for the liberation of Poland, while in Belarus are the 
graves of Poles who fought our common enemy. Our nations are 
fraternal, and Belarusian-Polish brotherhood in arms has been 
sealed by blood. This cannot be forgotten. 
  With regard to the current day, the ties between our Armies 
are strengthening and mutual contacts are becoming permanent and 
multifaceted. As of recently, for example, working meetings 
have been held between the defense ministers of both our 
countries, as well as meetings between military delegations on 
various levels, including border troops from your 28th Army 
Corps and our Warsaw Military District. 
  [Palchevskiy] Not long ago, Poland was a member of the 
Warsaw Pact, but now it strives to join NATO. What is the 
reason? Such a step is surely designed to incite anxiety among 
Poland's neighbors to the east. 
  [Bortnowski] With regard to the anxieties of our eastern 
neighbors, it may be said with full certainty: Poland wants to 
live with its all neighbors in peace and friendship. With 
regard to military and political reorientation, it can be 
attributed to the change of the world's general situation. In 
addition, it belongs to the competence of politicians, not 
servicemen. The leadership of any country, while taking care of 
its security, has to adopt definite resolutions. That is all I 
can say. 
  [Palchevskiy] Colonel, due to well-known circumstances, the 
prestige of military service in our republic has suffered a 
decline over recent years. What is the situation in Poland? 
  [Bortnowski] Military service in Poland is very prestigious 
-- it is distinguished and well-paid. The prestige of the Army 
rose considerably after the 1980's and the installation of the 
new state leadership. [passage omitted]

  [Text] After having entered into the computers the 
election results coming from 82 percent of the total number of 
electoral constituencies on the entire territory of the Republic 
of Moldova, this evening the Central Electoral Commission 
released for the mass media the rating of the first seven 
political forces, as follows: 
  The Agrarian Democratic Party -- 43.21 percent; 
  The Bloc of the Socialist Party and the Edinstvo Unity 
Movement -- 21.77 percent; 
  The Bloc of Peasants and Intellectuals -- 8.98 percent; 
  The Christian-Democratic Popular Front Alliance -- 7.31 
percent; 
  The Social-Democratic Party -- 3.51 percent; 
  The Democratic Party of Labor -- 2.55 percent; 
  The Reform Party -- 2.46 percent. 
  The chairman of the Central Electoral Commission said that 
tomorrow they will proceed to examine the electoral documents 
that were sent to them by each electoral constituency. The 
chairman also pointed out that he firmly rejects all assertions 
circulating false data claiming that the source was the Central 
Electoral Commission. He also mentioned the fact that the 
results that have been published until now do not have an 
absolute value and do not represent the final results of the 27 
February elections.

<F P=106> [Ioan David dispatch from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] Esteemed listeners: Two news conferences were held 
at the headquarters of the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova 
this morning with the participation of the international 
observers present at the 27 February legislative elections. One 
of the two news conferences was given by the observers of the 
Council of Europe, a body which was also represented by Senator 
Adrian Paunescu [vice president of Romania's Socialist Party of 
Labor], and the second was given by the delegation of 
representatives of the CSCE and NATO Parliamentary Assembly, 
which included eight Romanian parliamentarians. At the news 
conference of CSCE representatives, four Romanian deputies were 
also present. 
  During the dialogue with the press, the general opinion that 
crystallized was that, generally speaking, the elections were 
correct and without incidents, with the international observers 
having access to all voting stations. The largest number of 
objections referred to the entry of two or more persons in the 
ballot booths at the same time, usually husband and wife or 
relatives; in some cases, individuals from the voting sections 
would advise the voters for what political grouping they should 
vote. 
  The two news conferences were preceded by a meeting of the 
international observers with Mr. Petr Lucinschi, president of 
the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova, who thanked them for 
their activity during yesterday's legislative elections. The 
Parliament president said that a first and provisional estimate 
of the results of the voting indicates that the following 
groupings will surely be represented in Parliament: the 
Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova [PDAM], the Socialist Part 
and Edinstvo Movement, the Christian Democratic Popular Front 
[FPCD], and the Bloc of Peasants and Intellectuals. As a matter 
of fact, later centralized results coming from the provinces 
confirmed his statement. 
  Afterward, Mr. Petr Lucinschi apologized to the 
international 
observers for certain organizational irregularities noted by 
them and assured those present that the Republic of Moldova will 
evolve toward economic reform, conciliation, and peace and that 
it will observe the requirements on democracy formulated by the 
European structures.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 28, BNS -- Vaino Reinart, head of the 
Estonian delegation for negotiations with Russia, expressed the 
opinion that the next round of talks between the two countries, 
scheduled to begin tomorrow, will not break the deadlock. 
  "We hope Russia will abandon its unconstructive approach of 
tying the troop withdrawal timetable to an agreement on military 
pensioners," Reinart told BNS. 
  He emphasized that, in Estonia's view, an agreement on 
social 
guarantees for retired military should not determine the circle 
of military pensioners entitled to remain in Estonia. "The 
aliens law and the government decree explicitly state the 
categories of those persons, while the agreement deals only with 
technicalities: how they are to be paid, how they receive 
medical aid, who and how pays for their medical treatment, 
etc.," the diplomat explained. 
  Reinart voiced the hope, however, that the general agreement 
on troop withdrawal, which the delegations have almost 
completely finalized, will be initialed during the upcoming 
round of talks. He underscored that the withdrawal timetable, 
which Russia still hasn't presented, is part of the agreement 
and that the agreement cannot be initialed without the schedule. 
  When Estonia learned about Moscow's plans to protect the 
Russian- speaking population of the Baltic states and the CIS 
countries, it became "perfectly clear" why talks on economic 
issues are making no progress, Reinart said. "(The Russian 
program) plainly states that Russia should not promote economic 
ties with countries which, in its opinion, treat Russians badly, 
so we can't expect a breakthrough in economic talks," he 
maintained. 
  The solving of humanitarian issues, including the problem of 
citizenship, is blocked by diametrically opposite interpretation 
of the 1940 events and the states' succession, the Estonian 
diplomat claimed. 
  Reinart said the border issues working group plans to tackle 
demarcation of the sea border. The issue of adjoining areas 
will not come up during this round of talks, since Russia hasn't 
replied to Estonia's proposals. 
  The next round of Estonian-Russian talks is scheduled for 
March 1-2. Reinart and Russia's top negotiator, Vasiliy Svirin, 
will give a press conference on March 2.

  [Excerpts] Another round of Estonian-Russian talks will 
open today at Lohusalu. It will last for two days. [passage 
omitted] 
  According to the Baltic desk officer at the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, Aleksandr (Udaltsev), Russia has not taken upon itself 
any obligations regarding a troop withdrawal deadline. The key 
obstacle in the interstate talks is the fact that several sets 
of documents have so far not been signed. Russia is aiming for 
a social guarantees agreement for Russian military pensioners 
and their family members to be concluded at the same time as a 
timetable and a deadline for the Russian troop withdrawal are 
set. According to (Udaltsev), the talks opening today must 
focus precisely on these issues. 
  The Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Estonia received 
yesterday's statement of Aleksandr (Udaltsev), a Russian Foreign 
Ministry employee, with amazement. The Foreign Ministry finds 
that the content of (Udaltsev)'s statement is in conflict with 
both the CSCE and UN documents, as well as with Russian previous 
statements. The Estonian side is the more surprised by Russia's 
behavior because during the latest rounds of talks the Estonian 
side had made concessions on the issue of the troop withdrawal 
deadline, without possessing a satisfactory timetable. The 
statement of the Estonian Foreign Ministry notes that hopefully 
(Udaltsev)'s statement must be seen as a position of a Russian 
diplomat on the eve of another round of talks, so as to 
influence the talks. Should this, however, become Russia's 
official position then the issue of suspending the talks will be 
seriously on the agenda, due to Russia's unconstructive behavior.

<F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 39/94] </F>
  [Text] The Foreign Ministry is preparing an objection to 
Russia's unilateral intent to mark the border line between 
Estonia and Russia, ministry spokesman Juri Arusoo said. He 
referred to a statement by head of the Baltic bureau of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry Sergey Prikhodko, who has accused 
Estonia of unwillingness to mark the border jointly with Russia. 
  The Russian claims of Estonia's unwillingness are 
groundless, 
Arusoo said. Estonia is willing to settle the border issue as 
soon as possible, but it cannot be done on Russia's terms and 
before Russia has recognised the Tartu Peace Treaty, he pointed 
out. The Russian propositions have only concerned the present 
provisional border line, Arusoo explained. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman further pointed out that 
Russia has actually already started the construction of border 
control facilities and expressed his opinion that this may be an 
attempt to anticipate a possible international discussion of the 
issue. 
  Head of the Russian delegation Vasily Svirin accused Estonia 
of delaying the negotiations in a Russian TV news broadcast on 
Thursday [24 February]. He claimed that Estonia is unwilling to 
hold constructive negotiations or to discuss issues important to 
Russia. 
  The Svirin statement is another example of Russia's 
negotiation tactics, secretary of the Estonian delegation Ago 
Tiiman commented. He added that Estonia is willing to discuss 
any problems, while the Russian delegation understands 
negotiations as Estonia accepting any idea suggested by the 
Russian side. "Our partners forget that the entire world has 
found our tactics to be correct. But the Russian side does not 
respect the international opinion and only cares of its own 
position," Tiiman said. 
  The next round of negotiations is to take place in Lohusalu 
on March 1-2.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 28, BNS -- Illegal weapons trade 
between Estonia and Russia has increased of late, Director 
General of the Estonian Security Police Juri Pihl admitted at a 
press conference today. 
  Pihl said the current trend is that weapons from the former 
East European countries, a remarkable part of them manufactured 
in Western countries, are taken through Estonia to Russia. This 
is a reversal of the earlier situation when the arms traffic was 
directed from Russia through Estonia to third countries, the 
director said. 
  In recent weeks both Estonian and Russian officials have 
seized great amounts of arms being illegally taken into Russia. 
  In the course of a joint operation of the Security Police 
and 
the Defense Forces on Feb. 21, for example, over 500 TT 
[Tokarev] pistols were discovered in south Estonia near the 
Luhamaa border crossing. Another illegal arms consignment was 
discovered on the same day by Russian customs officials.

<F P=106> ["Joint statement issued by the President, Presidium of </F>
Supreme Council, and Council of Ministers on the sixth 
anniversary of the atrocities in Sumgait"] 
  [Text] Six years have passed since the atrocities committed 
in Sumgait. The entire world shuddered in February of 1988 as 
it witnessed the genocide of fanatical savagery. The name 
Sumgait became the symbol of atrocity, death, and horror. It 
also became a shameful testimony to the unhealthy and inhuman 
nature of illusive prosperity and society. Because this crime 
committed against humanity and civilization failed to obtain a 
deserving assessment, it became an ill-omened precedent and 
evolved into a shortsighted state policy. The same plan, crime, 
inhuman and unnatural logic was put to work in Sumgait, 
Kirtovabad [Ganja], Baku, Getashen, and Shaumyan. That 
notorious neocolonialist doctrine of using force to drown the 
national self-determination issue in blood became the main cause 
of the misfortunes and sufferings of hundreds of thousands of 
Armenians and Azerbaijanis over the last six years. The 
sharpened iron bars and knives used by the brutish mob of 
Sumgait were eventually replaced by firearms, then by Grads and 
grenades, and by powerful tanks and supersonic bombers. Not 
only tens of thousands of young men and innocent people were 
thrown into the melee of war, but also thousands of mercenaries 
and soldiers of fortune. 
  It is long overdue that the Sumgait syndrome be shaken off, 
and the condemnable behavior of solving human rights issues and 
interethnic problems by resorting to the use of force be 
abandoned. 
  Remaining true to the international norms of behavior, 
guided 
by the principles adopted by the UN, CSCE and other 
international and regional organizations for the peaceful 
resolution of contentious issues through political talks, 
proceeding from the state policy of establishing good-neighborly 
relations with all the neighbors, the Armenian Republic's 
authorities hereby express their determination to find a 
peaceful resolution to the Karabakh problem. They call upon the 
Azerbaijani leadership to refrain from the further escalation 
and internationalization of the conflict and instead welcome the 
establishment of a stable cease-fire and the peace- making 
initiatives for the political settlement of Karabakh problem. 
They call upon the leadership to refrain from undermining them 
yet again and from causing new privations and suffering to the 
two neighboring peoples so as not leave new black Sumgaitian 
pages to history.

  [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the 
latest situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the 
border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
  The latest reports from the NKR indicate that the situation 
along the front line is tense. Regardless of the many 
casualties they have suffered, the Azerbaijan National Army 
[ANA] units have maintained their intermittent attacks in 
various parts of the front line. A report we received from the 
NKR Defense Army Press Service a short time ago said that the 
situation in a large part of NKR's front line was relatively 
peaceful last night and this morning, that is after the violent 
clashes in the southeastern sector yesterday. Only intermittent 
positional fighting took place in various areas. The NKR defense 
forces destroyed three armored vehicles and dozens of ANA 
soldiers. One of the NKR freedom fighters was killed and eight 
others were wounded. 
  The NKR intelligence units have established that Azerbaijan 
is massing reinforcements and armored vehicles in the eastern 
sector of the front line. 
  Several newspapers in Moscow have quoted the Azerbaijan mass 
media organs as saying that the NKR Defense Army Headquarters 
has established additional punitive units. The reports said 
that the punitive units have been assigned to prevent the 
retreat of the Armenian troops. S. Oganyan, chief of the NKR 
General Staff, has disclosed that only NKR's disclosures 
represent the true state of affairs. Oganyan asserted that the 
NKR has not felt the need to organize punitive units since the 
NKR military forces were established. However, such units have 
been used in Azerbaijan to fire on the retreating Azerbaijani 
military forces. It is no coincidence that Azerbaijan's 
military servicemen prefer to surrender to the Armenian forces 
to avoid being fired on by those units. Some 60 officers and 
men have surrendered to the NKR defense forces during the past 
two months. Citizens of several foreign countries were among 
them. 
  The relatively peaceful situation on the border between 
Armenia and Azerbaijan during the past week, has been disrupted 
once again. The Armenian Ministry of Defense Press Service has 
disclosed that the defense positions around Berkaber and Kirants 
in Armenia's Idzhevanskiy Rayon were fired on from Azerbaijan 
with various types of arms on 24 February. Armenia's border 
guards took retaliatory measures. No one was hurt on the 
Armenian side. 
  The occasional provocative activities in Azerbaijan do not 
allow the establishment of peace and security on the border.

  [Text] Talks were held in Yerevan on 28 February between 
Davit Shahnazaryan, the Armenian president's ambassador on 
special missions and acting head of the State Directorate for 
National Security; Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sargisyan; 
the Russian president's representative in the region, Validimir 
Kazimirov; and the Russian Deputy Defense Minister Georgiy 
Kondratyev on finalizing the cease-fire agreement concluded 
during the meeting of the defense ministers of Armenia, 
Azerbaijan, and Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Kondratyev assessed the talks: I faced no problems in 
Armenia. The Armenian side, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, agrees 
to fully implement the Moscow agreement and cease fire as of 1 
March. I am leaving for Baku today. I hope to receive a 
similar reply there. It could be stated that a first step 
leading to peace is being taken. Russia, Kondratyev noted, will 
terminate its mediatory mission if Azerbaijan refuses to 
implement or disagrees with any of the provisions of the 
agreement. After all, both the Armenians and the Azerbaijanis 
are longing for the war to end. 
  He also noted that the planned visit to Stepanakert was not 
possible due to weather conditions. But the deputy defense 
minister assured that he will be there at the first opportunity.

  [Text] Yerevan, 28 Feb -- Four hours of talks with the 
Armenian leadership were held in Yerevan today by Vladimir 
Kazimirov, the Russian president's special envoy, and Colonel 
General Georgiy Kondratyev, deputy Russian minister of defense. 
The conversation with Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan 
was held behind closed doors. However, it is known that they 
concerned the new peace-making initiative of Russia, which once 
again is trying to stop the bloodshed in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  The representatives of the Russian leadership also met 
Armenian Defense Minister Serzhik Sarkisyan and the Armenian 
president's special envoy David Shakhnazaryan. As the Armenian 
president's press service has reported, during the course of the 
meetings the Armenian side reaffirmed that Yerevan is ready to 
assume all its commitments arising from the Moscow protocol. 
The conflict has reached a phase where a settlement is 
impossible without the introduction of separating forces, the 
participants in the conversation at the Armenian president's 
office stated. 
  As reported earlier, at the recent meeting in Moscow of the 
Armenian and Azerbaijani defense ministers with the 
participation of a representative of Nagorno-Karabakh, and with 
the mediation of the Russian defense minister, it was proposed 
to the conflicting sides that there should be a cease-fire and 
an end to hostilities from 0000 on 1 March, and also that troops 
should be withdrawn from the confrontation line. These points 
were sealed in the protocol that was signed. 
  Russia has done everything in its power, Georgiy Kondratyev 
told journalists. "We intended to visit Stepanakert," said the 
general, "but bad weather prevented us from going. The Armenian 
side was quite constructive and had no questions." According to 
the deputy minister, "if the Azerbaijan side does not respond to 
this initiative, Russia will suspend its mediatory mission." A 
cease-fire is awaited in Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and 
Azerbaijan and if all sides agree, a mechanism to implement a 
cease-fire, worked out by heads of the military directorates at 
a Moscow meeting, could be set in motion, Georgiy Kondratyev 
said. The general expressed certainty that the agreements will 
be respected by both Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. "It is 
essential," he said, "that Azerbaijan adopts a similar decision." 
  This evening, after the meetings in Yerevan, the 
representatives of the Russian president went to Baku.

  [Excerpts] Vladimir Kazimirov, Russian president's personal 
representatives in the region, and Russian Deputy Defense 
Minister Colonel-General Georgiy Kondratyev arrived in Yerevan 
at noon today. 
  Our correspondent Gevorg Nazaryan reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Nazaryan] The high-ranking guests were 
received at Zvartnots Airport by Davit Shahnazaryan, the 
Armenian president's ambassador on special missions and acting 
head of the State Directorate for National Security, and the 
Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sargisyan. The motorcade left 
for the government guest house, where talks were held. Here is 
what Valdimir Kazimirov said before the start of the talks. 
[passage omitted] 
  Russia's mediatory initiative to resolve the Karabakh 
conflict and issues pertaining to the implementation of the 
quadripartite agreement signed in Moscow on 16 February among 
Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, Azerbaijan, and Russia were 
discussed during the talks. The protocol envisages a program 
for ceasing the fire and the military operations and the 
withdrawal of the troops from the conflict zone as of 1 March. 
  The Armenian side confirmed that Armenia is ready to assume 
all the responsibilities emanating from the protocol. [passage 
omitted] 
  According to plan, the Russian delegation was to leave for 
Stepanakert today but unfavorable weather conditions canceled 
the flight. 
  After the talks, President Levon Ter-Petrosyan received 
Vladimir Kazimirov and Georgiy Kondratyev at 1700. They 
examined Russia's mediatory initiative for the peaceful 
resolution of the Karabakh conflict. They stressed that the 
conflict has now entered a phase in which its resolution is 
impossible without introducing separating forces. 
  The Russian delegation left for Baku in the evening. [end

  [Text] Radio Slavyanka has reported, quoting the VECHERNIY 
BISHKEK newspaper, that Kyrgyzstan's leadership is holding talks 
with NATO on providing the bloc with military bases on the 
territory of the republic. The newspaper wrote that when its 
correspondent approached the Kyrgyzstan Defense Ministry for an 
explanation, it was unable to either confirm or deny this 
report. During his official visit to Moscow, the republican 
President Askar Akayev clarified the situation in an interview 
with our correspondent. 
  [Begin Akayev recording] This will never happen, because we 
were one of the first co-founders of the collective security 
council. We were one of the first five countries in Tashkent to 
sign the collective security treaty and the decision to set up 
joint CIS Armed Forces. So of course we will rely on the joint 
armed forces in the business of defending our security and 
ensuring peace in Kyrgyzstan, and indeed in all the countries of 
the CIS, on the territory of the whole of the former USSR. [end

<F P=106> [Correspondent Vladimir Fedorov report from Kyrgyzstan; from </F>
the "Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] It is hard to assess the new schedule for broadcasts 
by Kyrgyz State Television as anything other than a stab in the 
back for the republic's president. From today, Ostankino 
broadcasts are being removed here after the newscast at 2100 
local time. Almaty and Tashkent programs, previously carried on 
another channel alongside Turkish broadcasts, are replacing 
them. Now, Ankara broadcasts solidly between 0900 and 0200 the 
next morning in a language that is completely unintelligible to 
the overwhelming majority of the Kyrgyz population. 
  It is, however, intelligible to local television and 
communication officials. Ostankino is in arrears for some 
reason, whereas the Turks pay up and have even handed over 
written-off video cameras as gifts. 
  It is typical that the squeezing out of Russian programs - 
and Mayak has also been subject to this policy - has occurred 
during the absence of Askar Akayev, who is now on vacation in 
Barvikha outside Moscow following his successful talks with 
Boris Yeltsin on the receipt of 75 billion rubles for a program 
to prevent the migration of Russians in Kyrgyzstan and to 
preserve the use of the Russian language. 
  As a result of this new assault on Ostankino, the republic's 
viewers will this week lose their evening news bulletins on 
Thursday and Saturday and also the "Voskresenye" program.

  [Text] [Mais Mamedov] A whole arms depot has been 
discovered by law enforcement bodies of Baku in the headquarters 
of the Azerbaijan People's Front. It consists of 42 projectiles 
for grenade launchers, about 200 bottles of inflammable liquid, 
73 bullet proof vests, fuses for grenades, and smoke pots. 
  Speaking today at a press conference, procurator-general of 
the republic Ali Omerov stated that according to information at 
his disposal the People's Front of Azerbaijan had been preparing 
a coup for 5 March. He also announced that in a number of 
districts of Azerbaijan today members of that organization had 
been detained and combat weaponry had been confiscated from 
them. Those arrested include citizens from Chechnya. 
  Minister of Internal Affairs Vafig Novruzov [as heard] 
described as ridiculous claims of the People's Front leadership 
that the weaponry had been deliberately planted by policemen to 
settle scores with members of that organization. He pointed ou 
that an inquiry was being conducted which would dot all the "i"s.

  [Text] At present there are 16 Azeri prisoners of war in 
Armenia, which has been confirmed by the International Red 
Cross, the chief of the press center of Armenia's Defence 
Ministry, Gagik Martoian, told Interfax. He qualified the 
recent Azeri radio allegations that Armenia is holding 3500 
Azeri prisoners of war, as "another lie." 
  According to Martoian, 5 Azeris were captured "when staging 
armed encroachment on Armenia's borders," and 11 when trying to 
cross Armenian territory from Azerbaijan to Nakhichevan. 
  Moreover, the Defence Ministry spokesman denied the Azeri 
Foreign Ministry's assertions that there are concentration camps 
in Armenia. 
  As Martoian said, last year Armenia unilaterally returned to 
Azerbaijan 16 prisoners of war and 60 civilians from Kelbajar 
District in Azerbaijan, who had taken refuge in the canyons of 
Vardeni District in Armenia.

  [Text] The chief Georgian negotiator at the 
Georgian-Abkhazian talks in Geneva, Jaba Ioseliani, has said 
that "UN troops will be deployed in Abkhazia, whether the 
Gugauta grouping wants it or not, and the process of refugees' 
return will begin." "This is what the Gudauta leaders are afraid 
of, since in this case all their claims to statehood will be 
buried," he told journalists in Tbilisi. 
  The Abkhazian leadership stands for deploying peacekeeping 
forces on the border between Abkhazia and Georgia along the 
River Inguri. 
  In comments on the results of the 3rd round of talks held on 
February 22nd-25th, Ioseliani said that the Georgian delegation 
knew from the outset that "the Abkhazian side will not accept 
any constructive solutions." "Nevertheless we met with them, so 
that the entire world can see with whom we are dealing," he said. 
  According to Ioseliani, all participants in the talks "were 
indignant at the destructive stance taken by Gudauta." 
Discussions on the Abkhazian problem are continuing at the U.N. 
in New York, he noted.

  [Text] Latvian Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis is highly 
critical of Russia's attitude in its negotiations with Latvia. 
According to Pavlovskis, Russia is constantly imposing new 
conditions for withdrawing its troops from Latvia. Valdis 
Pavlovskis is the first Latvian defense minister to visit 
Finland after the Second World War. 
  [Correspondent] A couple of weeks ago, Russia and Latvia 
were 
already close to agreement on the withdrawal of Russian soldiers 
from Latvia. However, the talks came to a sudden halt without 
any result. 
  [Begin Pavlovskis recording, in English] Unfortunately, the 
talks have stalled. I think in recent days the Russian attitude 
has hardened, has become more negative. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] According to Latvian Defense Minister Valdis 
Pavlovskis, the reason why the talks broke off was the Russian 
attitude that has hardened and become more negative. 
  [Begin Pavlovskis recording] Now I understand the Russians 
are imposing new conditions, stalling the old conditions and we 
just had...[fades to correspondents report] 
  [Correspondent] Pavlovskis says that Russia is now imposing 
new conditions for withdrawing its troops that are linked in 
particular, to the situation of the Russian soldiers in Latvia. 
According to him, it is not sufficient for Russia to reach 
agreement on the position of the disputed Skrunda high power 
radar. Pavlovskis admits that one reason why the talks broke 
off was that Latvia did not accept the annual rent of 11 million 
marks that Russia had offered. For this money, Russia would 
have been allowed to keep the radar for another four years. 
According to Defense Minister Pavlovskis, the rent for the 
radar station is, however, a matter on which agreement can be 
reached in the negotiations if there is the will. 
  Pavlovskis says that the rise of the conservative forces in 
Russia is clearly noticeable in the entire negotiation set-up. 
According to him, Russia now wants to argue about whether Russia 
invaded Latvia in 1940. 
  [Begin Pavlovskis recording] Now what the hell was it, if 
not 
an occupation? It was a historical fact, it was an occupation, 
(?but) troops that marched in and took us over...[fades to 
correspondents report] 
  [Correspondent] Pavlovskis demands that Russia should admit 
outright that it invaded Latvia and separate this historical 
manipulation from the current withdrawal negotiations.

  [Text] On the night of 28 February-1 March unknown people 
blew up an electric power line pole supplying electricity to the 
Russian radar station in the Latvian village of Skrunda. 
Interfax was told at the Russian Foreign Ministry that the 
terrorists failed to put the radar equipment out of action since 
the staff immediately switched over to another power line. As 
is known, there was talk at the Russian-Latvian negotiations of 
renting the Skrunda radar station for four years. However, 
certain political forces in Latvia are in favor of closing it 
down by the time Russian troops are withdrawn from the country 
this summer.

  [Text] Moscow, Feb 28, BNS -- The problems in 
Russian-Lithuanian relations would cease to exist if Lithuania 
would reply to Russia's numerous proposals concerning military 
transit through Lithuania's territory as well as defining 
economic zone boundaries, Sergey Prikhodko, a high-ranking 
official at the Russian Foreign Ministry, said today in an 
interview to the Baltic News Service. 
  Commenting on Lithuanian Foreign Ministry notes on 
unsanctioned transit through Lithuanian territory of Russian 
armored troops and on Russia's exploitation of an oil field in 
the Baltic Sea near the Lithuanian resort Nida, Prikhodko said 
the Russian Foreign Ministry deals with them in the course of 
everyday work. "We shall go them over and a reply will be 
forthcoming," the Russian diplomat stated. 
  "Naturally collisions may occur," Prikhodko said, "and we 
shall provide exhaustive explanations for the concrete 
complaints Lithuania has made." 
  The Russian official maintained, however, that disagreements 
might not arise if Moscow received as soon as possible an answer 
to its proposals to conclude an agreement on military transit 
through Lithuania's territory to and from the Kaliningrad region 
that would "clearly and unambiguously fix the rights and 
obligations of both parties." 
  In a comment on the oil field issue, Prikhodko said 
Lithuania 
received long ago Russian proposals on delimiting economic zone 
boundaries, but there has been no reply. 
  Prikhodko noted that Russia has submitted a total of 24 
draft 
agreements for consideration by Lithuania.

  [Text] First Deputy Foreign Minister Vladislovas Domarkas 
described as rather strange the reproaches by Russian diplomats 
that Lithuania allegedly is ignoring proposals to define the 
economic zones of both countries in the Baltic Sea. 
  Sergey Prikhotko, head of the Baltic states department at 
the 
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Second European 
Directorate-- commenting on the note issued by Lithuania 
concerning Russia's intentions to exploit the B6 oil deposit, 
which is situated in the sea not far from Nida--said in an 
interview to the Baltic News Service [BNS] that Lithuania failed 
to respond to the proposals advanced by Russia on the 
demarcation of the economic zones. 
  Domarkas, who is head of the state commission for 
demarcation 
of the state borders, told BNS that it was Russia who was 
avoiding negotiations on demarcation of economic zones in the 
Baltic Sea. At the latest meeting held by the negotiators in 
Vilnius at the end of January, more attention was given to the 
problems of maritime borders. It was at that time that the 
Lithuanian negotiators presented a draft of maritime state 
border demarcation prepared by the Lithuanian land surveying 
service. 
  The next meeting of the Lithuanian and Russian commissions 
for the demarcation of the state borders will be held in March 
in Kaliningrad or Moscow.

  [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas thinks that 
the jointly coordinated draft Lithuanian-Polish state treaty 
addresses the integrity of both states and the inviolability of 
state borders. The president said at a news conference today 
that the current mutual relations between both countries and 
prospects for future cooperation were adequately described in 
the draft treaty. 
  Answering a question of whether the property would be 
returned to the Polish public organizations which were active in 
the occupied Vilnius region in 1920-39, President Algirdas 
Brazauskas pointed out that this was not envisaged by the 
Lithuanian constitution. 
  According to the president, similar questions were raised by 
Jewish organizations in Israel. However, the two conditions 
envisaged for the reimbursement of private or state property say 
that persons claiming back their property must be citizens of 
Lithuania and reside permanently in Lithuania. If it is proved 
that these conditions are fulfilled then their property will be 
returned, regardless of their nationality, the president said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Justas Paleckis, Lithuania's ambassador </F>
extraordinary and plenipotentiary for special missions, by 
Zivile Kriauciuniene; place and date not given: "America Is 
Sharing Its Experience"] 
  [Excerpts] [Kriauciuniene] The press and television 
has briefly reported about your visit to the United States. It 
would be interesting to learn about its goals and results in 
detail. 
  [Paleckis] I went there at the invitation of the U.S. 
Information Service. This service, in cooperation with the 
State Department and other federal services, prepared a special 
program: To demonstrate how decisions on foreign policy issues 
are adopted in their country. [passage omitted] 
  The things that we saw could be summarized as follows: 
There, as well as in our country, foreign policy decisions are 
adopted by the president. Unlike us, however, no one imagines 
that he or she knows more than the president or feels human 
moods better. The American way of thinking is pragmatic and 
democratic: He who has won the elections has the right to 
decide. 
  It goes without saying that much attention was devoted to 
President B. Clinton's policy. He came to power with promises 
of focusing on domestic problems which, however, are not easy to 
resolve. Therefore, B. Clinton, like other presidents, 
immediately turned to foreign policy where effective results can 
be achieved more readily. Many political scientists with whom I 
met assess the president's foreign policy favorably, although he 
has not had any experience in this sphere until now. 
  This does not mean, however, that the president does 
whatever 
he wants. The National Security Council set up in 1948 
coordinates decisions adopted by government offices and consults 
the president. I think that we also made a similar move when 
establishing a Coordinating Foreign Policy Council late last 
year. 
  [Kriauciuniene] Can the things that you saw be applied 
in Lithuania? 
  [Paleckis] We could learn something: How to adopt decisions, 
analyze different options, and predict the future considering 
the interests of the state. 
  Moreover, the Americans wanted to show us the role of public 
opinion in adopting foreign policy decisions. Public opinion is 
expressed there not only through the press, television, or the 
legislature (which is the case in our country) but also through 
trade unions and lobbyism. [passage omitted] 
  U.S. ethnic minorities also express their interests in 
foreign policy. We had several interesting conversations with 
representatives of the black population. Currently, they are 
being represented broadly in the Congress, the diplomatic corps, 
and federal government institutions. Their number in the State 
Department might be slightly smaller. 
  Observing this, one may think that the participation of our 
Polish, Russian, and other minorities in adopting various 
decisions, including foreign policy issues, is insufficient. 
  [Kriauciuniene]So, the trip was interesting. 
  [Paleckis] [passage omitted] One realizes particularly 
clearly during such trips that the world is so big, while 
Lithuania is so small. One understands that we often exaggerate 
the influence of our country, the three Baltic states, or even 
entire Central Europe on the world. In fact, this influence is 
not so large. 
  In general, one could feel that America would become 
slightly 
less active in foreign policy after the cold war. Certainly, it 
does not intend to return to isolation, as was the case between 
the wars. Everyone remembers how many victims the failure to 
prevent fascism required. However, the Americans do not want to 
interfere in events that do not concern them. 
  One professor explained to me why NATO did not want to admit 
Poland. In case of aggression, NATO would have to defend it and 
send young U.S. soldiers to death away from home. Public 
opinion, which is considered there so much, would not approve 
this. 
  True, in the opinion of H. Kissinger, former national 
security secretary and state adviser, it is now that Central 
European states should be admitted to NATO. It is quite often 
the case that an activist from the opposition tries to express a 
different opinion from the official one because otherwise he 
would not be interesting to anyone, the more so that not being 
in power, he is not responsible for the effects. 
  Taking into account its economic interests, the United 
States 
is currently directing its glance toward the Pacific Ocean and 
the Asian region, particularly southeastern Asia. The economy 
decides politics. 
  [Kriauciuniene]Is the United States so little 
interested in Europe? 
  [Paleckis] It is interested in Europe as well. The key issue 
is Russia's problems. The rule of democracy and a free market 
in that country would protect the United States against many 
troubles, additional expenses, and the restoration of the cold 
war. Therefore, the Americans are determined to help Russia. I 
happened to hear the opinion that V. Zhirinovskiy is a 
considerable gift to B. Yeltsin because the Russian president 
can ask the West for more aid under V. Zhirinovskiy's threats. 
  While I was staying in the United States, B. Clinton 
returned 
from his trip to Europe. I was told at official federal offices 
that one of the key topics of his talks with President B. 
Yeltsin had been the issue of the Baltic states, particularly, 
the Army withdrawal from Latvia and Estonia. At the same time 
the United States wants the Baltic countries to apply 
international standards to ethnic minorities. 
  The United States is very much interested in good and 
constructive relations between Russia and the Baltic states. I 
happened to be in the Congress at the time when S. Talbott, 
assistant to the secretary of state, was making a report about 
ties with Russia and other CIS countries. He stressed 
repeatedly that assistance would be rendered to Russia only if 
the latter adhered to the norms of international law in its 
relations with other states -- former USSR republics and Central 
European countries. 
  It would be an illusion to think that relations with Russia 
will not be a U.S. priority. The very fact that the 
uncontrolled and chaotic development of this big state would be 
fatally dangerous to Russia's neighbors and even the 
transatlantic superpower is responsible for such a U.S. 
attitude. Thus, I categorically disagree with those who suppose 
that instability in Russia is useful to us and enhances our 
security. Undoubtedly, we would like that stability to be 
democratic and in line with the norms of international law. 
  [Kriauciuniene]Did you meet with the 
Lithuanian-American community? 
  [Paleckis] First of all, I would like to say that I had 
useful and practical meetings with Alfonsas Eidintas, Lithuanian 
ambassador to the United States, in Washington and Anicetas 
Simutis, ambassador to the United Nations, in New York. I was 
happy to hear that representatives of federal government 
institutions in Washington were pleased with the work of our 
embassy and its employees' competence. It is common knowledge 
that the official Washington assessed former Ambassador Stays 
Lozoraitis positively. It is pleasant, therefore, that 
favorable words are also said about the new ambassador. A. 
Eidintas has appeared as very flexible in maintaining ties with 
our emigres and their organizations. He feels the Americans' 
moods well. [passage omitted] 
  [Kriauciuniene]Is the emigres' attitude toward 
Lithuania's current government changing? 
  [Paleckis] I could not draw any conclusions from these 
several meetings. Recalling the president's trip to the United 
States last fall, I can say, however, that very many emigres 
wanted to see and hear him in New York and Los Angeles. Maybe, 
A. Brazauskas was unacceptable to some of them as a personality. 
but he was shown respect as Lithuania's president. 
  Incidentally, A. Brazauskas read an annual report in the 
Seimas [parliament] last week, and some members of the 
opposition did not stand up demonstratively or clap symbolically 
on his entry. This shows the lack of our democratic culture 
because disrespect for the president means disregard for the 
state. [passage omitted] 
  [Kriauciuniene]Could you explain in conclusion what 
your rank -- ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary -- 
means? Most people imagine that one may be ambassador only in 
some other country. 
  [Paleckis] I go abroad quite often, and not only with the 
president but also on special missions, as this one. Last fall, 
I visited NATO headquarters in Brussels, as well as Oslo, 
Moscow, Bonn, and other places. The title of ambassador 
extraordinary and plenipotentiary gives more weight and helps 
resolve certain problems. 
  [Kriauciuniene]Thank you for the interview.

  [Text] In an INTERFAX interview, presidential press 
secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov did not confirm reports that 
Nikolay Golushko was released from the post of director of the 
Federal Counterintelligence service because of family 
circumstances. 
  Kostikov emphasized that the edict did not contain such a 
phrase. 
  INTERFAX has learned from well-informed sources that 
Golushko's dismissal is mainly connected with the release of the 
participants of the Moscow October events from the Lefortovo 
prison remand cells.

  [Text] Viktor Ilyukhin, Security Committee Chairman of the 
State Duma, thinks that the president's decree dismissing 
Nikolay Golushko from his position as head of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service (FCIS) "has nothing to do with the 
State Duma's ruling on political amnesty or its materialization." 
  Ilyukhin found "it difficult to understand from the oblique 
formulations of the decree what caused the dismissal of the FCIS 
director general." He assumed that the real cause were the last 
September and October events when the former Security Ministry 
"showed adherence to the Constitution and doubted the 
constitutionality of the presidential decree 1400 of September 
21." 
  Ilyukhin thought that this was also the reason why a 
decision 
was made last December to dismantle the ministry and transform 
it into the Federal Counterintelligence Service -- with much 
smaller powers. 
  The dismissal of Golushko might displease the FCIS 
personnel. 
"It is the president's usual technique, to have an agency 
dismantled by somebody he does not like and then dismiss him."

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Kudakayev report under the "Resignation" rubric: </F>
"Annual Replacement of Special Service Head"] 
  [Text] The Russian president's press service has advised 
that Colonel General Nikolay Golushko has been relieved of his 
duties as Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] director. 
As has been the case more than once, FCS personnel were the 
last to learn about this -- and from INTERFAX reports. The FCS 
Public Relations Center, therefore, finds it hard to comment on 
this event. Observers give as the reason for so sudden a step 
the recent release of the "Lefortovo inmates." Onlookers refer 
to the existence of a certain document forwarded to the heads of 
power agencies by presidential structures which indicated 
bluntly that no release of the opposition leaders was 
admissible. Golushko has been "punished" for everybody. 
Officials in the presidential staff state in this connection 
that the president had long been dissatisfied with incoming 
information. 
  Another possible version of Golushko's dismissal is "the 
Ames 
affair," because some reports speak about the presence in the 
FCS of foreign agents of a similar level. It seems to us, 
however, that the more probable cause for the dismissal is its 
"having been planned." It was obvious to virtually all experts 
that this person was temporary, and the president availed 
himself of all the sensational events of recent days as a 
pretext. 
  Current first deputy Sergey Stepashin is being named as the 
more probable candidate for Federal Counterintelligence Service 
director. It is possible, however, that an outsider will be 
appointed to this post. I have in mind former KGB generals who 
are not on the FCS staff but who are in the civil service and 
who have to do with the top echelons of power. The appointment 
of a civilian to this position is seen as unlikely.

  [Text] Moscow March 1 ITAR-TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin met Chairman of the Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko 
and Chairman of the State Duma Ivan Rybkin in the Kremlin on 
Tuesday to express his view on the political situation in the 
country in the wake of the amnesty proclaimed by the parliament. 
  Yeltsin said he was aware of the negative reaction of the 
public both to the political amnesty of the people accused of 
crimes against the state and to the haste with which the 
parliament resolution was fulfilled, as a result of which the 
first to be freed were the persons charged with the gravest 
crimes against the state. The president said that the 
Constitution, the law and the procedural code were violated in 
the process. 
  The president then heard the State Duma chairman's 
explanations of the motives behind the house resolution on 
amnesty, as well as his assurances that the State Duma would 
draw appropriate political lessons and ensure a more balanced 
approach to the adoption of resolutions which are likely to 
entail serious political and moral consequences. 
  Yeltsin noted that he understood the concern expressed by 
the 
public, the press and individuals but refused to share the 
excessive evaluations and conclusions concerning the state power 
in Russia. "At present I see no real danger for civil accord and 
am in full control of the social and political situation," the 
president said. 
  The president said he decided against immediate tough 
measures taking into account the announced intention of the 
State Duma to act towards national concord and an understanding 
by the considerable part of the deputies of the fact that by 
passing a resolution on political amnesty they thereby assumed 
responsibility for the possible political activity of those they 
amnestied. 
  The president stressed that he regarded the agreement of the 
defendants to accept the amnesty as their recognition of guilt 
of criminal activities. 
  "Should the slightest attempt be made at destabilising the 
situation in the country, they will be arrested straight after," 
Yeltsin said. The president has issued appropriate instructions 
for the purpose. 
  During the meeting, the president and the chairmen of the 
Federal Assembly's chambers coordinated plans for the upcoming 
activity of the Federation Council, the State Duma and the 
president.

  [Text] Moscow February 28 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin will meet with his senior aides and the State Duma 
chairman on Tuesday to discuss ways to boost cooperation between 
the legislative and executive branches, Yeltsin's Chief of Staff 
Sergey Filatov said on Monday. 
  The statement was made after his meeting with Duma Chairman 
Ivan Rybkin, following the State Duma decision on amnesty for 
the leaders of the 1991 August failed coup, May Day riots and 
the October 1993 revolt in Moscow. 
  Filatov said that the recent events have revealed the lack 
of 
proper interaction between the two branches. He noted that both 
sides will set up working groups to iron out disagreements 
before March 10 when the Duma, the lower house, will reconvene. 
However, he refused to say in what particular directions the 
groups will be working, adding that the State Duma, as a 
collegiate body, should first "hold an internal discussion of 
what has happened." 
  Speaking about reports that Yeltsin was planning to address 
the nation on television tonight, Filatov said he did not know 
anything about it. 
  "It is most important to understand that the Duma's 
resolution means amnesty for only some people, but the 
investigation should be carried on," Filatov said. 
  The meeting was also attended by Acting Public Prosecutor 
Aleksey Ilyushenko, Yeltsin's representative in the State Duma 
Aleksandr Yakovlev and his senior aide Georgiy Satarov.

  [Text] Moscow March 1 TASS -- Following the release of 
October armed revolt organisers, the trial of 1991 abortive 
Soviet coup leaders was declared over on Tuesday. 
  On the basis of the political amnesty proclaimed by the 
State 
Duma the court ruled to drop criminal proceedings against former 
Soviet top officials who organised the 1991 August coup in 
Moscow. 
  The political amnesty proclaimed by Duma covered the 1991 
coup plotters, organisers of the 1993 armed opposition revolt in 
Moscow and of the May Day demonstration last year. All the 
three events resulted in bloodshed.

[State Committee for the State of Emergency] in the military 
collegium of the Russian Supreme Court, a decision was reached 
in accordance with which the criminal proceedings against the 
defendants Anatoliy Lukyanov, Valentin Pavlov, Vladimir 
Kryuchkov, Oleg Shenin, Dmitriy Yazov, Oleg Baklanov, Valentin 
Varennikov, Yuriy Plekhanov, Vyacheslav Generalov, Aleksandr

  [Text] Moscow February 28 TASS -- The Russian Democratic 
Reform Movement has called for neutralising the extremist 
tendencies in Russia, following the amnesty declared by the 
Russian State Duma for hardline coup leaders. 
  In a statement issued on Monday, the movement leaders urged 
the State Duma deputies to adopt an amendment to their decision 
on amnesty to limit the right of those pardoned to conduct 
political activity and be elected to posts in state bodies of 
power until the new presidential and parliamentary elections are 
held in the country. 
  The movement also called on all Russian parties and public 
organisations seeking to lessen political tension in society to 
urgently get down to work to set up a popular coalition of 
reform, which is the only means of saving Russia, as the 
statement said. 
  However, Valentin Kovalev, deputy chairman of the State 
Duma, 
stressed earlier today that under international agreements of 
which Russia is a party, it has no right to limit political 
rights of people who have been released by amnesty. "Therefore I 
believe that people released in connection with the act of 
political amnesty cannot be limited in their political rights. 
Otherwise it would contradict the norms of international law," 
he said. 
  He said that State Duma faction leaders suggested adopting a 
special act stripping those pardoned of what they have received 
under amnesty if they continue to destabilise the situation in 
the country. However, such a document would need clear-cut 
juridical specifications rather than political interpretations, 
primarily of the term "destabilisation," Kovalev said.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Amnesty No Danger to Society"] </F>
  [Text] An insignificant number of convicts, approximately 
20,000 out of the more than 800,000 held in corrective labor 
camps and solitary confinement centers, will be released from 
their places of confinement. Major General of the Interior 
Service Valeriy Orlov, first deputy chief of the Russian 
Interior Ministry's Main Directorate for Enforcing Sentences, 
said this in conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent 
yesterday. 
  He noted that, formally speaking, the amnesty covers a far 
greater number of people and this has given rise to various 
conjectures and rumor. However, the present amnesty will not be 
anything like the general release of recidivists well known from 
the movie "The cold summer of 1953." In the main the people to 
be released will be the very old, whom it is simply inhuman to 
keep in places of deprivation of liberty, invalids, and minors, 
as well as first-time offenders guilty of a crime of negligence 
or of a crime which does not pose an exaggerated danger to 
society. In particular, those who took part in combat actions 
in defense of the motherland will be freed from punishment.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1720 GMT on 28 February carries in its "Details" 
program an "exclusive" 10-minute interview with Aleksey 
Kazannik, former procurator general, conducted by correspondent 
Nikolay Svanidze. 
  Asked whether he thinks that those who walked free from the 
Lefortovo prison were criminals, Kazannik replies: "As a former 
procurator general I cannot make any such comment. This matter 
is exclusively in the jurisdiction of a court. I may have a 
personal opinion about them, but if they were amnestied, they 
have to be released immediately, whether I like them or not. 
The law is the law." 
  Asked whether Yeltsin and his entourage put any pressure on 
him last week, Kazannik says: "Definitely. Because Baturin's 
message contained a proposal to disobey or at least to drag out 
the amnesty act. Meanwhile, Boris Nikolayevich's [Yeltsin] 
resolution said the following: Kazannik, Galushko, and Yerin 
are to follow Baturin's instructions. This was direct pressure. 
This was direct intervention into the jurisdiction of the 
procurator general." 
  Aleksey Kazannik goes on to say that his duty, as procurator 
general, was "to implement a resolution of the State Duma on a 
political and economic amnesty." He says that he contacted 
Yeltsin on Friday and asked him to repeal his orders, but 
Yeltsin categorically refused to do so. During his conversation 
with Yeltsin, he offered his resignation, but Yeltsin refused to 
accept it, and demanded that Kazannik find a way out of the 
situation. 
  Asked whether Yeltsin made it clear what sort of solution he 
was seeking for that situation, Kazannik replies: "No, he did 
not make it clear, but later his immediate entourage, his 
advisers tried to help me find a solution. But it was an 
unlawful solution. In fact, our conversation on Friday boiled 
down to how to stop the State Duma resolution." He says that he 
was told to ask the Duma to clarify the meaning of the word 
"immediately," to explain the fact that one part of the 
resolution calls for a general amnesty while another part only 
mentions Article 79 of the Constitution, and to define the 
difference between an amnesty and a pardon. Kazannik continues: 
"Under pressure, I was forced to say that the procuracy would 
indeed ask the State Duma for these clarifications, but 
nevertheless, I repeatedly said that the procuracy had nothing 
to do with this. The procuracy has no legislative powers. It 
does not question, but strictly follows legal enactments." 
  Kazannik adds that some ideas put forward by Yeltsin's 
advisers were simply laughable, such as the suggestion to 
declare the resolution invalid because it was published in the 
wrong section of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. 
  Kazannik goes on to say that he is sorry if he disappointed 
Yeltsin by not obeying him, but when Yeltsin had appointed him, 
he accepted the post on the understanding that he would strictly 
follow the laws of the country, rather than personal orders. 
  In conclusion, Nikolay Svanidze says that Aleksey Kazannik 
is 
going to give up his recently acquired official residence and 
move back to his native Omsk. Meanwhile, the executive power in 
Moscow seems to be in complete disarray.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 28 Feb -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev is convinced that neither the decision to amnesty 
Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and their associates, nor these people 
themselves "can in any measure destabilize the situation in the 
country, which is guaranteed by the provisions of the 
constitution and the policy of the Russian president." 
  Speaking today at a regular meeting with Russian and foreign 
journalists at the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation, 
Andrey Kozyrev, who is a deputy, also said that for him and many 
other Russian parliamentarians the Duma's decision on a 
political amnesty "seems shameful." "These people," he stated, 
"should be in prison. They broke the law and should be sent 
back to prison and tried. And then, perhaps, an amnesty will be 
extended to them." 
  This is a "mistake by those who released them," the minister 
stressed, "and I think the Russian president will take the 
appropriate decision in his own time."

<F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Lukyanov by Enrico Franceschini in </F>
Moscow; date not given: "`Yeltsin, Change Your Policy'" -- 
first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Moscow -- Of the 253,000 prisoners and detainees 
waiting for trial, who were pardoned through an amnesty, the one 
who has the least reason for rejoicing is Anatoliy Ivanovich 
Lukyanov, because he already got his own back. As the president 
of the Soviet parliament until 1991, for many years he was the 
most powerful man in the USSR, after Gorbachev. Arrested and 
imprisoned as one of the promoters of the failed coup against 
perestroyka, he suddenly seemed a finished man, destined to end 
his days in jail. However, after having been released on 
parole, last December he was elected deputy for the Smolensk 
uninominal constituency ("supported by 102,000 voters," he 
emphasized proudly), in the most democratic elections in 
Russia's history. He represents a unique case worldwide, worthy 
of the Guinness book of records: a defendant who, in his 
capacity as deputy, voted in favor of his own amnesty, and thus 
pardoned himself. In this interview with LA REPUBBLICA, this 
resilient "great old man" explained the Duma's sensational 
decision. 
  [Franceschini] Was the amnesty a way of challenging the 
president? 
  [Lukyanov] No. It was a legitimate step, a proposal aiming 
at peaceful coexistence, so that we stop treating each other 
like enemies. 
  [Franceschini] But an amnesty is a "pardon": By accepting 
it, are you not in fact acknowledging your guilt as regards 
involvement in the 1991 coup? 
  [Lukyanov] Not at all. The amnesty provides for the 
suspension of the proceedings. It does not bring in a verdict 
of guilt. I never admitted being guilty, and I certainly will 
not do so now. 
  [Franceschini] You are known as an eminent jurist. Is this 
amnesty -- which pardons at the same time those who were 
persecuted for ideological offenses and those who fired their 
weapons and killed people during last October's insurrection -- 
not abhorrent to you? 
  [Lukyanov] If, among the rebel parliament's defenders, those 
who fired should be prosecuted, then those who fired on 
parliament should also be prosecuted -- those who opened fire 
first, and those who ordered the White House to be shelled. The 
authors of that attack were never prosecuted, so it is only 
natural that those who were on the other side should also be 
pardoned. 
  [Franceschini] Has the Duma permanently given up conducting 
an enquiry into last October's violent incidents, in exchange 
for the amnesty? Will you no longer attempt to prosecute 
Yeltsin? 
  [Lukyanov] We would have been forced to give up sooner or 
later, anyway, because the government was not providing us with 
any of the necessary evidence for an enquiry. However, even 
without our contribution, some day public opinion will demand 
that this matter be cleared up. The country wants to know the 
truth. 
  [Franceschini] Do you think Yeltsin will try to block the 
amnesty at the very last minute? 
  [Lukyanov] If he does so, he would be smothering the 
new-born 
constitution. The Duma has acted lawfully. A reasonable 
politician will not take such a step. He does not enjoy enough 
popular support to afford doing that kind of thing. 
  [Franceschini] Does this mean, then, that the struggle 
between the president and parliament has come to an end? 
  [Lukyanov] Can the struggle come to an end if the government 
does not change its policy? No, it cannot. Because of such a 
policy, social inequality has reached unprecedented levels in 
Russia. If Yeltsin does not change his policy, the struggle 
will flare up again even more forcefully. 
  [Franceschini] Do you not think that Yeltsin has already 
changed his policy, by making the radical reformers leave the 
government, and slowing down the pace of reform? 
  [Lukyanov] It is too late. He should have done so two years 
ago. I hope that common sense will prevail now. If Yeltsin 
defends the state's heritage, if he safeguards the most basic 
human rights, if he seriously combats crime, and protects our 
country's -- rather than some other country's -- interests in 
the international arena, then we will support him. 
  [Franceschini] Once he is free, will former Vice President 
Rutskoy become the head of the opposition? 
  [Lukyanov] Rutskoy is jointly responsible for a large part 
of 
Yeltsin's policies, starting from the liquidation of the USSR. 
His former political prisoner's halo will not be enough to 
enable him to become the country's new leader. 
  [Franceschini] Gorbachev has expressed concern over the 
amnesty. 
  [Lukyanov] Gorbachev should be happy that he will not have 
to 
testify in our trial. Thus he will not risk ending up on the 
defendants' bench rather than staying among the witnesses. 
  [Franceschini] Do you consider yourself a communist? Would 
you like to restore the dictatorship of the proletariat? 
  [Lukyanov] We cannot go back, dictatorship will never again 
be possible. Despite the fact that today we are living under an 
authoritarian, Bonapartist regime, with all the power 
concentrated in the president's hands, democracy is a conquest 
that no one can take back from us. Within the Duma, I am not 
part of the communist group, but the communists call me the 
parliament's Deng Xiao Ping. Said by them, I regard it as a 
compliment. 
  [Franceschini] While you were in prison you wrote poetry. 
Are you still writing any or did your inspiration dry out? 
  [Lukyanov] I am still writing. However, in prison I wrote 
200 poems, but I have only written 30 as a free man. "Outside" 
there is no time to reflect. Who knows, perhaps I would be 
happier "inside."

  [Text] Speaker of the Duma Ivan Rybkin at a meeting of 
senior parliamentary officials on Monday said he was confused 
over the undue haste with which the Prosecutor General's Office 
had ordered the release of the leaders of the October uprising 
from Moscow's Lefortovo prison. 
  This follows a statement from Defense Committee chairman 
Sergey Yushenkov who represented the Russia's Choice Party at 
the meeting. In his words, the speaker said that former 
prosecuter general Aleksey Kazannik had sent him a letter on 
Saturday asking how to implement the Duma amnesty resolution but 
announced his resignation later in the day without waiting for 
reply. 
  Yushenkov said that as soon as the Duma reconvened on March 
11, a draft resolution would be put up for discussion warning 
the uprising leaders that the amnesty could be withdrawn if they 
violated Article 70 of the Criminal Code. The article spells 
out punishment measures against organizers of mass riots.

  [Text] Constitutional Court [CC] Judge Valery Zorkin has 
refused to comment on whether or not the Duma's amnesty 
resolution was constitutional. In an interview with Interfax on 
Monday, he said such a judgment was the prerogative of the CC as 
a whole and that being only one of its members he had no 
authority to consider or discuss it with the press on his own. 
  At the same time, Zorkin said that away from judgments, any 
parliamentary act was mandatory for execution unless rescinded 
in a proper way. 
  In his view, the noise over the amnesty resolution only 
helped fuel confrontation. 
  Zorkin said that in a civilized country, any official 
regardless of rank could have been sacked if he had opposed a 
mass media law in public. But in Russia, he said, 
"parliamentary acts are immediately pilloried by those who are 
called upon to hold them sacred and execute them at once".

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 40 (530): </F>
Reports by Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor 
Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Presidential aides Georgiy Satarov and Yuriy Baturin 
and Yeltsin's representative in parliament Aleksandr Yakovlev 
held a news brief in Moscow on Monday. 
  In an opening speech, Yakovlev said he thought that the main 
idea of the president's message to parliament was a commitment 
to build a democratic society in Russia in democratic ways in 
keeping with the country's constitution and laws. 
  For his part, Satarov said the new constitution marked an 
end 
to the stage of building democracy from "above". He described 
Russia's democracy as rather fragile adding it needed internal 
stability to survive. The aide described as fundamental those 
aspects of Yeltsin's address. 
  Both officials agreed that Russia was still in need of 
coordinated legislation to ensure internal stability under its 
multi-party democracy. "The system tends to become a 
destabilizing factor when the number of parties exceeds five", 
Satarov said. And he called for the creation of such parties 
which could reflect real public mood and opinion. Satarov 
pointed to the message's section saying part of government 
functions must be devolved to the public. 
  The Duma's Saturday resolution on amnesty for October 
uprising leaders dominated the agenda. 
  Yakovlev said the society was tired of political squabbles. 
In his view, many of the deputies voted for amnesty driven by a 
sincere desire for civic peace. He said it would not be long 
before it became clear whether the resolution was aimed at 
national reconciliation or confrontational attitudes. 
  On the possibility of the amnesty being withdrawn, Satarov 
said the rebellion leaders could be jailed again only Interfax 
they were in breach of law. [sentence as received] "Such is the 
president's belief", he added. The aide described as crazy the 
suggestion from one of the journalists saying the president 
could try to overturn the amnesty resolution by force. 
  One other aide, Yuriy Baturin, who was 45 minutes late for 
the briefing because of a routine meeting with Yeltsin said: 
"Our society is in need of an amnesty law. Without such an act, 
it will be hard to envisage steps for minimizing the negative 
implications of the Duma's amnesty resolution". Baturin 
reaffirmed having discussed this with Yeltsin. But declined to 
comment on the meeting though not ruling out the possibility of 
Yeltsin appearing on appear on national television on Monday. 
  Baturin described the continuing split in the democratic 
camp 
as by far the greatest danger for Russia's fledgling democracy. 
"We must overcome it. I hope we will, otherwise there can be no 
democratic society," he said. 
  A presidential message listing priority bills, scheduled to 
be submitted to the Duma this Monday, will not be sent to the 
lower house of the Russian parliament for at least two or three 
days. Georgy Satarov, president's assistant, told Interfax 
Monday that "the State Duma forced us to attend to other 
business," meaning the presidential team's attempt to have the 
release of those amnestied by the Duma put off. 
  According to Satarov, those attempts were not dictated by 
the 
desire to safeguard the president from a comeback by his 
political opponents. Rather, the goals of Yeltsin's messages to 
the prosecutor general and the State Duma were to align the 
amnesty with the law and minimize the harm it might do. 
  Satarov did not agree with the view that the presidential 
team had been passive while the Duma had debated and later 
adopted the amnesty resolution. He said that he had proposed to 
the State Duma Council on February 22 that the issue should not 
have been discussed before the annual presidential message was 
heard. 
  Satarov emphasized that the lower house of parliament was 
best placed to prevent a new increase of political tension in 
the country. He said that he had been assured by State Duma 
Chairman Ivan Rybkin that the parliament's leaders were aware of 
this responsibility.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Fomicheva] </F>
  [Text] St. Petersburg, 1 Mar -- St. Petersburg Mayor 
Anatoliy Sobchak called the amnesty a human act, commenting at 
the request of an ITAR-TASS correspondent on the amnesty for the 
Lefortovo detainees declared by the State Duma. But he said 
that "this decision is an act of political struggle and a 
challenge to the president and to the policy he is conducting. 
It cannot fail to act as a means of political destabilization." 
  In Sobchak's view, "the point is not that people should be 
in 
prison; the main thing is that the actual crime should be 
condemned. 
  "There is no doubt that a crime was committed on 3-4 October 
last year against the individual and the state, an armed 
rebellion that led to numerous fatalities. That fact cannot be 
erased by any amnesties at all." 
  Anatoliy Sobchak recalled that the first draft constitution 
stated that an amnesty could be declared by the Federal 
Assembly, i.e. the State Duma and the Federation Council. 
Unfortunately, he said, in the final version of the 
Constitution, that stipulation fell by the wayside, and only the 
State Duma retained the right, which the opposition took 
advantage of. 
  Nevertheless, St. Petersburg's mayor stressed, the State 
Duma 
had the right to declare an amnesty, and there are only a number 
of questions connected with the wording of the amnesty 
declaration. "It's one thing when it covers people who are 
involved in mass disorders; it's quite another thing when they 
are involved in violence and murder. That is precisely the 
charge brought against a whole string of participants in the 
events of October." 
  According to Sobchak, an actual amnesty can be applied only 
to persons who are guilty of committing crimes. "But if they do 
not acknowledge their guilt, an amnesty cannot apply to them." 
This legal problem should have been resolved by the 
Procurator-General's office before the organizers of the October 
rebellion were released."

  [Text] "Now is the time to turn over a new leaf and start 
the process of public reconciliation", leader of the Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord [PRUC] Sergey Shakhray said on Monday. 
  He described as "perfectly correct" his party's support to 
last Wednesday's package. This included a resolution on 
political and economic amnesty, amnesty in connection with the 
adoption of the new constitution, a memorandum of concord and a 
resolution to rescind the Duma resolution on setting up a 
commission of inquiry into last October's uprising. 
  Shakhray said it was impossible to pass a legal judgment on 
the October events in Moscow because this could be passed only 
on criminal cases rather than "acts of civil war". He said the 
winner was alone in a position to enforce his legal judgment 
through government structures. 
  At the same time, he expressed regret that the uprising 
leaders had been released so soon by the Prosecutor General 
Office [PGO]. 
  Shakhray said the State Duma must issue a statement saying 
"no one is allowed" to take advantage of the amnesty to incite 
people for renewed violence. 
  Shakhray said the faction's position had enlisted support 
from PRUC's regional branches. 
  He said Yeltsin's representatives knew about a forthcoming 
resolution and the balance of forces in parliament let alone 
attended the session a day before the resolution was approved 
[sentence as received]. Shakhray said this was an indication of 
lack of coordination on the federal level between actions taken 
by administration, government, parliamentary and PGO officials 
with each side left to act on its own. 
  Shakhray expressed regret over Prosecutor General Aleksey 
Kazannik's resignation. In his view, the PGO was not dragged 
into politics under Kazannik but there is a threat that this may 
happen following his departure.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1910 GMT on 28 February broadcasts the 60-minute, 
recorded, "Without Retouching" program featuring an interview 
with Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko by moderator 
Georgiy Dolgov and a panel of press and broadcast 
correspondents. 
  An ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent begins by saying that the 
recent amnesty decision to release the putschists points to it 
being a plot between parliament and government. 
  "You know", Shumeyko replies, "I could not see any sign of a 
plot. If you want to speak about this, however, then Russia 
told the whole world that it would build a law-based state and 
that there would, at long last, be a division of powers in 
Russia into legislative, executive, and legal powers. Each 
branch of power has its own prerogatives. It so happened that 
the Duma declared an amnesty, and it did so according to the 
law. If you look at Article 103 of the Constitution, it is 
there in black and white." 
  Shumeyko goes on to define amnesty as the release of 
criminals from punishment and says that the legislative body 
adopted the role of the court. He says: "Whatever my attitude 
may be to the Lefortovo inmates, I believe that they treated 
them incorrectly. Still, there had to be a trial, and the court 
decided. Then there was an amnesty. Now it turns out that, 
some people say, that once the inmates acknowledged the amnesty 
and left prison they admitted they were guilty and admitted they 
were criminals. They admitted they were guilty of everything 
that happened. That is one point of view. The other point of 
view says no. They were innocent. They should be released." 
  Shumeyko says it is a good that people have different views, 
so long as it is according to the law. He adds that what has 
happened is over, and we must see what happens next. 
  A SEGODNYA correspondent asks Shumeyko about budget 
allocations to the agrarian sector in the first quarter. 
Shumeyko says that this matter was discussed in the Federal 
Council, and they arrived at a figure of 7 trillion rubles. He 
adds that it is a matter of choosing the right path between high 
inflation and supporting commodity producers and says that the 
latter must be supported. 
  A KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent asks Shumeyko whether 
Aleksandr Rutskoy, now that he is free, has information that may 
be used against some of the present leaders, including Shumeyko 
himself. Shumeyko says he does not think that Rutskoy has any 
secret information. It is the same old story, he says, when 
some people fabricate charges for personal gain. 
  Dolgov interjects that a commercial bank bought up documents 
containing materials that compromised Shumeyko. Shumeyko says 
he has never signed any document that could be interpreted as 
corruption. 
  The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent then asks Shumeyko 
what he has gained from recent moves in his career. Shumeyko 
replies that he and his predecessor, Ruslan Khasbulatov, had 
different opinions on many issues. He says he believes that 
more than half the laws adopted by the previous Supreme Soviet 
were of a political nature and that this merely hindered the 
progress of the reforms. 
  A ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent asks if the Federation 
Council would overturn the amnesty decision if it had the power. 
Shumeyko says he believes that it would. He says he is against 
the amnesty decision as a politician and chairman. 
  An IZVESTIYA correspondent asks about the technicalities 
with 
regard to Procurator General Kazannik's resignation. Shumeyko 
says: "The Federation Council is not in session at the moment. 
The next session will be on 15 March. It happened like this: 
Procurator General Kazannik resigned. The president--on the 
basis of Kazannik's resignation statement--wrote out his 
instruction, or edict. He wrote that he had received Kazannik's 
resignation and that he would go to the Federation Council with 
a proposal to release Kazannik and to appoint Ilyushenko to the 
office. 
  "I received this letter from the president. During the 
recess between sessions, I said that there was no procedural 
norm, so I signed the instruction. I do not have the right to 
make the decision. I do not have the right to decide for the 
whole Federation Council. Therefore, the instruction literally 
said the following: until examination of the question of the 
resignation/appointment by the Federation Council, in accordance 
with Article 102 of the Constitution, to agree with the 
president's proposal to entrust the execution of duties to 
Ilyushenko. In other words, this is until 15 March. On 15 
March, all these official letters of the president will be 
submitted, and we will examine them in the proper manner. We 
will adopt a decision then, or we will not adopt a decision." 
  Shumeyko continues by elaborating on the importance of the 
struggle against crime and, hence, the importance of making the 
correct decision over the post of procurator general. 
  An OBSHCHAYA GAZETA asks if Russia is not in a dangerous 
position now with a new Duma in place and the possibility of 
further confrontation. Shumeyko says he does not see any 
confrontation between the powers at present. He adds that time 
will tell how matters develop, but the main thing is that proper 
laws are adopted and are accepted by the people. He says he 
believes that everything can be solved politically. 
  A LITERATURNAYA GAZETA correspondent asks when there will be 
another October this year--alluding to a statement by Communist 
Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov. Shumeyko retorts that it will 
be in October, according to the calendar. He says he takes 
these statements with a grain of salt. 
  Answering a question from a Radio Rossii correspondent about 
the make-up of the parliament and the different factions, 
Shumeyko says that while there may be great differences in the 
Duma, there are no such factional divisions in the Federation 
Council. He adds that all deputies are equal and, therefore, it 
will come to decisions more quickly. 
  A Radio Svoboda correspondents asks what Shumeyko thinks the 
next round of presidential elections in 1996 will look like, 
whether it will be a Zhirinovskiy-Rutskoy or 
Chernomyrdin-Rutskoy-Zhirinovskiy clash. Shumeyko says he does 
not like predictions, and it will be up to the people to decide 
who their president will be. He add that he does not believe 
the formulas Radio Svoboda has presented will in fact emerge. 
He says that the thing to remember is that the institution of 
the presidency is still a young one in Russia; it is still 
emerging and needs to be consolidated. 
  Shumeyko then answers a question from PRAVDA about the state 
of the media's finances. He says it is obviously a good thing 
if the country has well-established papers, and PRAVDA has a 
special place in the country's life. He adds that a reduction 
in taxes would help the press. 
  Dolgov asks about television, and Shumeyko replies that 
television also needs funds. He adds that as long as television 
is owned by the state it is part of the budget. He says that 
television, in general, is in need of investment. 
  The ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent cites an article in THE 
FINANCIAL TIMES about vast sums of cash going out of the country 
and then asks what Shumeyko is going to do about corruption in 
the Federation Council. Shumeyko talks about the need for 
foreign investment. He adds that there is not such a big 
problem with regard to corruption. 
  The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent asks if Shumeyko 
intends to elevate the status of the Interparliamentary 
Assembly. Shumeyko says he does, particularly when it comes to 
tackling issues in areas like Karabakh and others with a 
Russian-speaking population. He says that a plenary session 
will be held on 17-19 March and that all justice ministers and 
chairmen of arbitration courts will be invited to debate a 
Russian civic code. He adds that a social code also needs to be 
worked out. 
  The SEGODNYA correspondent asks Shumeyko how inflation and 
extra cash to Agroprom can be balanced. He then asks how far 
Shumeyko is prepared to go to avoid extreme inflation. 
  Shumeyko replies that inflation can be curbed as long as the 
money goes to the right areas and the agro-industrial complex is 
one. 
  Shumeyko closes by giving brief answers to questions. He 
says he is not planning to run for president at the next 
election and believes it would be good for Russia if Yeltsin 
were to hold office again. He says only fascist newspapers will 
be closed down.

<F P=106> [Anna Ostapchuk, Yevgeniy Krasnikov report in the </F>
"Collision" column: "The Opposition Gets Rivals From Lefortovo. 
The President Begins a Realignment of Forces"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The president's unwillingness 
to turn to the Constitutional Court (the sole body with the 
power to overrule the Duma's resolution) suggests that his 
attitude to the amnesty decision is not as negative as some of 
his associates (Sergey Filatov and others) make out. This 
version is also corroborated by the fact that all measures to 
prevent the execution of the sacramental resolution came a 
little late in the day. 
  Indeed the Duma made its amnesty decision on 23 February 
while the president's response (letters to speaker Rybkin and 
General Prosecutor Kazannik) did not come out until the 26th. 
Of course, such a belated reaction can be attributed to the 
general lack of coordination in the presidential services and 
their unreadiness for such a turn of events (although it is very 
hard to describe the Duma's decision as totally unexpected). 
Yet it can be supposed that all these "impeding" actions on 
Yeltsin's part are no more than an artful stage production 
devised not only to prevent an investigation which is unwanted 
by the president, but first, to demonstrate to the radical 
democrats the president's solidarity with their position; and 
second, to facilitate Aleksey Kazannik's transfer from the 
General Prosecutor's Office to the Constitutional Court. It 
this is correct, Yeltsin's acceptance of Kazannik's resignation 
is not a sign of disgrace but only part of a calculated plot. 
It is not ruled out that the aura of a principled and 
independent man will help Kazannik take the vacant seat of the 
Constitutional Court chairman. (It should be noted 
parenthetically that Aleksey Ilyushenko, currently acting 
prosecutor general, can hardly ever become an object of such a 
complex intrigue. His political reputation is quite certain: 
He is a former member of the Interagency Anti-Corruption 
Commission which charged Rutskoy with signing some compromising 
documents). 
  To be sure, the State Duma's amnesty decision hardly pleased 
the president. Signs are, however, that the upper hand was 
gained by those members of the presidential team who maintained 
that the "Octobrists" are much more dangerous in the symbolic 
image of martyrs than as real political figures. 
  The complaints by the radical democrats who treat this 
action 
as a step toward civil war appear unsubstantiated. After all, 
the amnesty decision does not restore the political power 
duality September 1993-style but only increases the number of 
opposition leaders by a few men. 
  The liberation of Anpilov and Konstantinov will hardly 
consolidate the opposition and inspire it to take to new 
barricades. The performance by these political figures in 
September and October aroused criticism even among Yeltsin's 
forthright opponents while the associations led by them -- the 
National Salvation Front and Working Russia -- are now in a 
profound organizational crisis. 
  As for Aleksandr Rutskoy, as a politician he certainly 
enjoys 
great authority. But it should be remembered that he became 
leader of the whole opposition and a real alternative to Yeltsin 
by virtue of his high post, in the extreme situation of a coup 
d'etat. Now opposition politicians (Zhirinovskiy, Zyuganov, and 
Baburin) should see him rather as a potential rival: According 
to people close to Rutskoy, he intends not only to return to 
politics but even to contest presidential elections. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Vasiliy Ustyuzhanin report: "Is Kindness Worse than a </F>
Crime?"] 
  [Text] The State Duma's amnesty decision has aroused a 
storm of high emotion. We won't judge the political aspect of 
the event. We will verify the document's legality. What do 
jurists say? 
  Anatoliy Sobchak, St. Petersburg mayor and a lawyer: 
  "The Duma's decision is unlawful. Only those who have 
acknowledged their guilt in the commission of a crime and on 
whom judgment has already been passed can be amnestied. If 
someone does not acknowledge his guilt (and the participants in 
the events of 1991 and 1993 have, by all accounts, not done so), 
how can they be amnestied?" 
  Tamara Morshchakova, judge of the Constitutional Court: 
  "I can say only that the act of amnesty differs from a 
pardon 
in that the latter is individualized. An amnesty may be granted 
regardless of the stage of the proceedings in the case. 
Moreover, it may also be applied to actions into which no 
criminal proceedings have been instituted at the moment of the 
promulgation of the act of amnesty." 
  Richard Pipes, professor at Harvard University: 
  "This decision demonstrates that the concept of a 
rule-of-law 
state is very underdeveloped in Russia. How can you amnesty 
people who have not been tried at all and when no one even knows 
whether they are guilty or not. It is a political move and has 
nothing at all to do with the law." 
  Aleksey Kazannik, general prosecutor of Russia: 
  "Each of the defendants subject to the amnesty will be 
informed of the content of the Duma decree. If they are in 
agreement with the Duma decision, I will issue a decree halting 
criminal proceedings." 
  As you can see, the legal and political impasse is obvious. 
The two branches of power have gotten into this impasse. This 
is the consequence of the ill-considered and mutually 
destructive decisions that were made in the fall of 1993. The 
sides have now tried to find a compromise. The president would 
not want the creation of a parliamentary commission to 
investigate the tragic events of October. The Duma went along 
with him, as it were, and revoked the decision to set up a 
commission. But it immediately made up the ground ceded by 
adopting the amnesty act. As is becoming clear, this is not a 
compromise capable of reassuring society. The house we live in 
has clearly not become more peaceful. The Constitutional Court 
could act as arbiter in the conflict situation, but it currently 
is literally `outlawed,' as the law on the Constitutional Court 
has not yet been adopted. The president revoked the old Law "On 
the Constitutional Court" by his well-known Edict No. 1,400, so 
the main arbiter remains offside. 
  What have the politicians been fighting for?

<F P=106> [Article by Alla Yaroshinskaya, member of the Presidential </F>
Council: "Foros in the Kremlin?"] 
  [Text] A state of shock is, I am sure, what millions must 
have found themselves in when they heard that it was only on the 
morning of Saturday 26 February that presidential aide Georgiy 
Satarov delivered a letter from President Yeltsin to Speaker 
Ivan Rybkin requesting revision of the chamber's amnesty decree. 
  Expecting precisely such a natural reaction from the 
president and his closest aides immediately after the adoption 
of the decree, and not receiving it in the two days that 
followed, many people decided that very high-level and subtle 
politics were involved here. Former USSR President Mikhail 
Gorbachev voiced his conjecture directly on television. It 
really seemed to many people that the Kremlin simply had to 
react, and immediately, to the Duma's amnesty decree, that it 
did not have the right in the face of the whole country and the 
world to do otherwise. But if it was not reacting or 
protesting, that meant that something which we mere mortals were 
not privy to was afoot here, but we mere mortals could 
nevertheless be sure that we were being looked after and that 
everything was all right. 
  Now it emerges that, while the presidential aide was 
conveying the president's letter to the speaker, the general 
prosecutor was giving up the prosecutor's "throne of office" and 
his deputy was deciding the country's fate. 
  In other words, there was simply no dark secret about, for 
example, Boris Yeltsin's having agreed with Ivan Rybkin and 
Viktor Chernomyrdin on some political concessions from them in 
exchange for the president's granting of freedom to the heroes 
of the civil carnage. It did not and does not exist. What, 
then, in that case was there? 
  The amnesty decree was passed by the Duma on Wednesday 23 
February, just before the president's annual address to the 
Federal Assembly deputies. On the morning of 24 February I -- 
as a member of the Presidential Council -- went to the session. 
But how surprised I was, then, when the security guards at the 
entrance, after carefully examining my pass as a member of the 
Presidential Council, refused to let me into the hall.... 
  That morning I was unable to see anyone -- the president, 
his 
aides, the head of administration. I heard the president's 
speech on television at the same time as I saw "on the box" the 
very people whom I had very much needed to communicate with 
personally. Hearing no direct references in the president's 
speech to the amnesty, I thought that there were undoubtedly 
decisions of some sort in being of which we were unaware and 
that consequently things were as they should be. It was simply 
impossible to imagine it otherwise -- that no one was seriously 
thinking about this. But I wanted to know for sure whether 
things were as they should be or not, particularly as 
immediately after the adoption of the decree Aleksandr 
Maksimovich Yakovlev, a very experienced lawyer and, what is 
more, the president's representative in the Duma, stated in a 
television interview that the Duma's decision fell within its 
remit. While Aleksey Kazannik also stated immediately after the 
president's speech that he would carry out the Duma's decision 
as soon as he was in receipt of documents which were not at odds 
with the law. 
  After the president's speech I began trying to contact 
Administration Chief Sergey Filatov by phone with the intention 
of fixing up a meeting. He has two offices: One in the 
Kremlin, close to the president's, and another on Staraya 
Ploshchad, closer to the apparatus. At Staraya Ploshchad they 
said that he was busy. Somewhat later I was told that 
unfortunately he had already left for the Kremlin. At the 
Kremlin, however, they said: "He will not be here till Monday." 
This strengthened me even further in my conviction that 
everything was all right, that everything was consequently as it 
should be; after all, the head of administration could not go 
away for three days at a time when the Duma amnesty decree would 
have to be carried out. No, that could not happen in a normal 
country! 
  The Duma had, after all, by this time already made several 
attempts to implement the amnesty decree -- and certainly in a 
way designed to empty the cells in Lefortovo. (One 
scandal-renowned politician wryly joked while discussing this 
topic with me over the telephone: 
  "They (meaning Yeltsin's team) have emptied Lefortovo for 
themselves." Anyone interested in politics presumed quite 
justifiably that the administration's numerous experts and 
analysts were engaged day and night in studying various courses 
of action or -- even better -- potential outflanking maneuvers. 
  On 24 February I was telephoned by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA editor 
Natalya Polezhayeva, who was almost in hysterics: State Duma 
deputies had been contacting her on the ordinary phone lines and 
the special government ones asking why the newspaper had not 
published the amnesty decree? "I replied," Polezhayeva said, 
"that I did not have the complete package of documents yet. 
Someone had reported to Rybkin that the decree would not be 
carried in the newspaper the next day, the 25th. Rybkin faxed 
me a letter and demanded a written explanation for the Duma. I 
faxed to him my explanatory letter to the Duma. But I myself 
telephoned Kostikov. He heard me out and said: `What is there 
to do, then? It has to be published.' So I carried the whole 
`package' of documents in the issue. It was announced on the 
"Novosti" program on the evening of 26 February that ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA was publishing the amnesty decree the next day. (People 
will know that the decree comes into effect from the moment of 
its publication. In other words, the publication gave the spur 
to its further implementation -- A.Ya.). Immediately after the 
"Novosti" news program, at 2200, I was telephoned at home by 
Satarov who asked why the decree was being published. I 
explained this to him in plain terms. He became very 
down-hearted and said that he and Baburin would now `concoct 
something,' draft some kind of letter from the president to 
Rybkin. After that call I realized that there was no secret 
concerning the amnesty, that they had simply not thought about 
anything over there...." I consoled the editor by joking that 
she would certaintly be given credit by the Lefortovo prisoners 
when they were released. 
  On the 26th, right up to the release of the whole gang, I 
dialed all the important Kremlin numbers. Only secretaries 
answered. The secretary of first presidential aide Viktor 
Ilyushin said: "He is working elsewhere and won't be here 
today." 
  I told journalists who rang me that the inner circle -- and 
they are literally just a few in number -- could actually be 
working somewhere at a dacha, as is usual with our country's 
political establishment. But I had no other, "dacha" telephone 
numbers available to me. I still did not believe that 
everything could be simply so primitive -- that no one was 
actually making any calculations, undertaking anything, or 
apparently intended doing so. AND IF YOU, PRESIDENTIAL AIDE 
GEORGIY SATAROV, HAD NOT BY CHANCE HEARD ON THE OSTANKINO 
CHANNEL THAT THE DUMA AMNESTY DECREE WOULD BE PUBLISHED IN 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, THERE WOULD SIMPLY NOT EVEN HAVE BEEN THE 
BELATED LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT TO IVAN RYBKIN ON THE MORNING 
OF 26 FEBRUARY! 
  The president's letter, which was written after the 
"Novosti" 
program, on the night of 25-26 February and which was designed 
to show everyone the concern felt by the authorities at this 
senseless act, explains, at least to me, a very important thing 
which is just as dangerous as the amnesty act adopted by the 
deputies, namely that the supreme authorities were -- we will 
learn some time whether by accident or design -- in a complete 
information vacuum. Just as during those memorable days in 
October, everyone had, as it were, disappeared and was getting 
on with work and other concerns at "different venues." Only 
this time the role of Gaydar in providing the danger signals, 
danger signals above all for the authorities, was taken on by 
television announcers. But, alas, this time when they heard 
about the act amnestying those whom they had opposed in October 
1993 Russians STAYED AT HOME. Only the Red opposition was 
attending rallies. THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE RALLY PROTESTING 
AGAINST THE DUMA DECISION OR SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT'S LETTER. 
  Certain nonimportunate questions occur to me in this regard 
which I would like to ask those whom I was unable to reach by 
telephone in the Kremlin for a whole week. 
  First, I would very much like to know the name of the bright 
guy who proposed to Yeltsin and persuaded him that it was 
extremely necessary for the president to head off Volfovich's 
[Zhirinovskiy] amnesty idea and himself sumbit such a 
legislative initiative to the Duma. Who is this benefactor of 
ours? Did the whole legion of experts, analysts, and political 
scientists in the Kremlin and on Staraya Ploshchad really not 
realize that the Duma would certainly exploit the proposal to 
add their own paragraph -- about a political amnesty? But if 
that was so and the proponent of the idea was very anxious about 
the 20,000 people "inside," why did he not consider that option 
and warn the president? Let us suppose that he did consider it 
and issued a warning, but the president decided to initiate the 
amnesty just the same. Why, then, did the president's men (and 
new president's men now) not consider and propose in good time a 
dozen options to meet this expected event? After all, the Duma 
had persistently approached this point during several divisions 
but had lacked the votes. Even Volfovich and his team could not 
produce a result. (None other than Sergey Shakhray, deputy and 
minister who was appointed a member of the Security Council by 
the president himself two weeks ago, helped here, as we know. 
Greatly concerned about reconciliation and harmony in society, 
he came to everyone's aid at the crucial moment with his Party 
of Russian Unity and Accord, stating during a TV interview 
immediately after the president's speech that the political 
forces which voted for the amnesty must assume responsibility 
for the future exemplary behavior of those who had stepped out 
of line, and modestly keeping silent about his own role in this 
story). 
  Not only were the president's moves not planned even one 
step ahead, but the state mass media proved unprepared for such 
a scenario; TASS political observer Tamara Zamyatina described 
in detail on Sunday's "Itogi" program how they were simply 
unable to get anything intelligible out of anyone behind the 
Kremlin wall. Only nonstate television in the "Itogi" program 
gave a complete picture of the mood in the Kremlin and at 
Lefortovo both at the moment of release and afterward. Only 
after the event did state television shamefacedly show scraps of 
documentary footage of October 1993, complete with the calls to 
seize the Kremlin, City Hall, and Ostankino. 
  The president has a very large number of people around him. 
They can no longer fit into the Kremlin. But for the umpteenth 
time he has found himself hostage to them alone, with his fate 
balanced on a knife edge. 
  But the juggernaut rolls on. A month ago we met with the 
president and spoke about the poverty-stricken state of the 
press in our state. During our 30-minute conversation he 
summoned aides and apparatus staff by telephone five times, even 
giving them instructions on these questions. Subsequently I 
wrote official notes to him and his aides several times with 
proposals regarding what needs to be done to avoid further 
confrontation with journalists. Alas, everything keeps flowing 
and nothing changes. 
  But while General Barannikov was getting his things ready to 
leave, a colleague of his, also a KGB general, who had looked 
after Barannikov's public relations, was getting ready to assume 
the sensitive leadership of the press in the capacity of first 
deputy chairman of the State Committee for the Press. That is 
something, colleagues! It is a long time since we have been run 
from there. But the time has come, and the documents have 
already been submitted to the government for confirmation . 
  These are the questions which I would like answered both as 
a 
member of the Presidential Council and as an ordinary citizen 
who is not indifferent to either the fate of the country or, 
naturally, the fate of my own children.

<F P=106> [Petr Zhuravlev, Dmitriy Kuznets report in the "Victory" </F>
column: "Amnesty Changes the Political Situation in Russia. 
Rutskoy, at the Head of Combatants, Will Stand Up to 
Zhirinovskiy"] 
  [Text] The somewhat dubious prospect of ensuring national 
concord hardly inspired the State Duma deputies during 
yesterday's voting for a package containing the elements 
"memorandum of accord, amnesty, political amnesty, abolition of 
the commission to investigate the October events." It is more 
logical to assume that lying behind the slogan of universal 
conciliation are quite concrete political interests whose 
coordination was reduced to commonplace bargaining. 
  The agro-communist bloc, which sought to the very end to 
uphold the "investigation" commission, tried to use the package 
for just another attack on President Yeltsin. Gennadiy 
Zyuganov's supporters were ready to agree to the prospect that 
the inmates to be released from Lefortovo can pose serious 
competition for the "legal" opposition and cause just another 
split within communist ranks. Yet even the threat of renewed 
political activity by Russian Communist Workers Party leader 
Viktor Anpilov did not keep them from the temptation to 
demonstrate their fighting spirit to the Kremlin. True, it needs 
to be recognized that the liquidation of the parliamentary 
commission was a fairly tangible fly in the ointment for the 
Russian Federation Communist Party and the Agrarian Party of 
Russia. 
  Sergey Shakhray, traditional author of various 
"compromises," 
according to Deputy Viktor Sheynis (Yabloko faction), "has won 
in his own game: Now he will be called the father of national 
accord." This accord, however, appears rather one-sided. It was 
the Communists who rushed to congratulate Shakhray on his 
impressive victory after the session. Shaking his hand, 
Zyuganov's associates were happy: "At last Sergey Mikhaylovich 
has waken up." 
  The PRES [Party of National Unity and Accord] leader 
himself, 
however, did not share this joy over his own "awakening." PRES' 
"natural allies," i.e., Yabloko and Russia's Choice, did not 
display any particular ecstasy over the proposed formula for 
ecumenical conciliation. Moreover, the muffled hissing behind 
Shakhray's back clearly contained the word "treachery." Having 
tipped the scale in favor of the Communists (this conclusion 
follows from the voting results), Shakhray has for the first 
time dissociated himself from the "democratic bloc." In spite 
of this, he will always be received back into the fold with 
outstretched arms: His "natural allies" need heads too badly. 
  Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar is waiting for the first 
results of the "national accord" -- the appearance of "Rutskoy, 
Khasbulatov, and others at the head of combatants in Moscow 
streets." According to Viktor Sheynis, on the other hand, the 
political revival of the Lefortovo inmates is not a catastrophe. 
In fact Sheynis sees their release as a boon for the president 
and the entire democratic camp. 
  The first "plus" is the possibility for the president to get 
gracefully out of the situation where the participants in the 
October events have acquired the aura of martyrs while "chances 
are that they will never be indicted anyway." Another "plus" is 
Aleksandr Rutskoy's participation in the upcoming presidential 
elections. According to Viktor Sheynis, Rutskoy has an 
electorate similar to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's, which they will 
share on an approximately equal basis. Therefore the chances 
for victory by a democratic candidate in the elections are still 
intact. 
  It is dubious, however, that Boris Yeltsin has such a gift 
of 
prophesy and it was for the sake of these dubious advantages 
that under the Constitution he endowed the Duma with the power 
of amnesty, whereupon a corresponding bill to the parliament's 
lower chamber was submitted. Moreover, not to understand that 
the Duma majority will add political amnesty to this draft law 
points to a total lack of political acumen.

<F P=106> [Sergey Chugayev report: "Having Declared Amnesty, Duma </F>
Leaders Have Begun Presidential Campaign"] 
  [Text] V. Zhirinovskiy, leader of the LDPR [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia] faction in the State Duma, announced 
after the close of the 23 February session of the lower chamber 
of parliament that this day could be regarded as a new Russian 
national holiday -- a sort of Day of General Reconciliation. 
For his part, S. Yushenkov, one of the leaders of the "Russia's 
Choice" faction, expressed the belief that this day could signal 
the start of civil war. 
  Such polarized opinions regarding the decree adopted by the 
Duma on an amnesty for those who took part in the August [1991] 
and October [1993] events in Moscow must, obviously, be put down 
to understandable emotions. The assessment given in the Duma 
lobbies by one of the leaders of the "intransigents" seems more 
accurate: The amnesty act was adopted in order to give a fillip 
to the country's domestic political situation which has become 
somewhat static since last October. 
  It must be admitted that the attempt was entirely 
successful. 
The domestic political situation in the country has livened up 
noticeably. But this fact yet again demonstrates quite 
graphically that the State Duma has focused exclusively on 
politics, and there are currently no grounds for hoping that it 
will get down to lawmaking. 
  To confirm this conclusion, it suffices to analyze the 
progress of the Duma debates 23 February. Virtually all those 
present, that is to say the leaders of the factions and 
deputies' groups, paid little heed to the topic of the day -- 
the amnesty itself -- mainly devoting their speeches to 
expounding political programs. It was therefore hard to shake 
off the impression that you were attending the launch of a 
presidential election campaign. Indeed, the time is already 
ripe for this campaign to begin, and it can be assumed that it 
was this fact which impelled a number of Duma factions to be so 
persistent in bringing to a successful conclusion the solution 
to the problem of an amnesty for people who hold the same views 
as they do. 
  The organizers' main target, judging by information provided 
by factions on the left, is not the president and the 
government, although, needless to say, they will not be left in 
peace. The same G. Zyuganov who called for civil peace demanded 
a change of government. The main objective, however odd it may 
seem if we bear in mind the LDPR faction's initiative proposing 
the combination of a political and economic amnesty in a single 
decree (this formula consequently became one of the main reasons 
for the triumph of the amnesty's supporters), was to knock one 
of the favorites -- V. Zhirinovskiy -- out of the presidential 
elections, which are just beginning. The united opposition has 
acquired the chance to have a popular leader and can 
correspondingly count on the support of a significant proportion 
of LDPR supporters. It seems that V. Zhirinovskiy himself is 
perfectly well aware of this fact, but he is obliged to go for 
broke, so to speak. 
  Thus, in the opinion of most observers, if the leaders of 
the 
defenders of the White House were to be released, a desperate 
leadership struggle would unfold on the political left wing. 
And this could not fail to have an impact on the unity and 
strength of the ranks of Communists and patriots. 
  Consequently there is every reason to think that the same 
factors will encourage concentration on the right wing of the 
political spectrum. And Gaydar's embryonic party has the 
opportunity to become much more than an ephemeral political 
structure. 
  At the same time, as the course of the 23 February Duma 
session showed, the niche in the center between the two wings 
which has remained vacant for some time has apparently already 
been filled. 
  There is every reason for thinking that the package of 
documents adopted by the Duma, which includes the decree on the 
political amnesty, was passed mainly with the assistance of the 
PRUA [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] faction. It was the 
rapid departure of this faction from the right wing which 
guaranteed the supporters of the amnesty the necessary advantage 
of just over 33 votes. Moreover, the obvious harmony between the 
Memorandum on Accord adopted by the Duma, which acted as pretty 
packaging for the decree on the political amnesty, and the PRUA 
faction's announcement published a few days previously on its 
civil reconciliation initiative, gives cause to suggest that S. 
Shakhray actively participated in the preparation of that very 
package of documents which included the decree on the political 
amnesty. 
  In the opinion of a number of observers, this proves that S. 
Shakhray has finally broken away from the presidential team and 
that he was unsuited for the prime minister's political team, 
which he has been ardently seeking to join of late. Obviously, 
the quest for new political allies led S. Shakhray to the Duma, 
where his rapid rapprochement with Speaker of the House I. 
Rybkin, who has switched to centrist stances, is not going 
unnoticed. It is sufficient to cite the example of the 
appointment of Shakray's close friend A. Boykov as leader of the 
Duma apparatus despite severe resistance from the Communists, 
the agrarians, and Zhirinovskiy's supporters. Thus it is 
difficult to shake off the impression that the leader of the 
PRUA faction intends to embark on the path taken by R. 
Khasbulatov in order to implement his political aims: Namely, 
with the speaker's help, to seize control of the Duma apparatus 
and, using it, to form on the basis of factions gravitating 
toward the center if not a majority, then a strong and, most 
importantly, manageable group of deputies. 
  All of this ultimately leads to the conclusion that the 
majority of Duma politicians will continue exclusively to 
resolve their own political issues, to fight for victory in the 
presidential races, for instance. Work on laws in this 
situation has every chance of being consigned to oblivion. 
  And this, in turn, means that the Memorandum on Accord, the 
need for whose adoption was accepted by the Duma majority by 
dint of its support for the political amnesty, is unlikely to 
function. At any rate, the speeches by a number of faction 
leaders gave no cause to conclude that they intend to implement 
the ideas expounded in the memorandum.

  [Text] Moscow, 1 March -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has totally 
denied all accusations of propagandizing war during questioning 
by a military procurator. On Monday evening he was questioned 
by a procurator of the Main Military Procuracy, which is 
conducting the Zhirinovskiy case. The LDPR [Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia] leader denied that his book, "The Last Dash 
South," and other printed or verbal speeches called for war, 
combat actions, and the annexation of other states to Russia. 
  Earlier, on 25 February, Irina Kulikova, vice president of 
the Aesthetics Association of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 
was summoned to the Main Military Procuracy for questioning. 
She is the author of a book on the LDPR leader, "The 
Zhirinovskiy Phenomenon," assisted in putting together "The Last 
Dash South," and, in the opinion of observers, is a spiritual 
mentor of Vladimir Volfovich. Irina Kulikova also denied that 
in "The Last Dash South" or other printed or verbal speeches 
Zhirinovskiy had called for war or violence. 
  It was earlier reported that a criminal case had been 
instituted under Article 71 of the Russian Criminal Code, 
"Propagandizing war in any form," against Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
by the Procurator General's office after numerous requests from 
citizens were made to law enforcement bodies and the Central 
Electoral Commission in connection with their having seen calls 
for war in publications and speeches by the LDPR leader. The 
Main Military Procuracy has been charged with conducting the 
Zhirinovskiy case.

Mikhail Poltoranin, "Russia's Choice" State Duma deputy, and 
Viktor Stepanov, Federation Council deputy and chairman of the 
Republic of Karelia Supreme Soviet: "Question to Deputies: 
What Do You Think of the President's Message?"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  The Regions Will Save Russia </H5>
  Mikhail Poltoranin, "Russia's Choice" State Duma deputy: 
  It seems to me that on this occasion the president tried, 
like never before, to analyze the current situation in the 
country in depth. For some people this seemed to be a departure 
from the reforms policy, for others there seemed to be nothing 
new in the message, and still others said there were more 
statements than proposals in it. I, having an insider's 
knowledge of everything and following the president's thoughts 
step by step, can see that the report proved to be difficult for 
the president and I would say that he came out with it too late 
-- he should have made it two years ago. 
  Without boasting and claiming more for myself than I should, 
I can say that I said similar things at Russian Government and 
Presidium sessions in February-March 1992. I said then: There 
are two ways of converting to a market economy. One way is to 
open the sluice gates, but we have to determine how much we can 
open them. Here, having worked out a program of structural 
restructuring for industry and created a modern doctrine for the 
Russian Armed Forces, leaving part of the military-industrial 
complex's plants under this doctrine and the international arms 
market -- let us say about 40 percent, with 60 percent 
undergoing conversion, an effective tax policy program would 
have to underpin all that which would stimulate the productive 
forces' development. This is what "opening the sluice gates" 
meant. 
  Then there is the second model -- you blow up the dam, that 
is there is a chaotic transition to market economics. You blow 
up the dam, pressure is released, and absolutely everything is 
washed away -- be it useful or not, then you sort everything 
out. At that time I warned that if we started down the second 
path -- and we did actually start down the second path and blew 
the dam -- we would just the same be forced to follow the first 
model after a couple of years, but by that time we will be 
swallowing or being swallowed up by the mire we have gotten 
into. In principle this is what has happened. But Gaydar is 
not guilty of this. Gaydar was in general in agreement with 
this level of regulation back then, but he lacked a team. Those 
people who criticize Gaydar today -- Shokhin and others -- are 
culpable precisely because they did not manage to carry out the 
modeling while they occupied key posts. Several models should 
have been demonstrated, then we should have forecast where we 
would be, and only then should we have acted. 
  But everything happened as God had ordained it. The 
president was to bring into the government more people from the 
provinces...but he gave in to pressure from Shokhin's team -- 
they said that they would not accept anybody into the 
government, their team, then this government in general began to 
represent a sect. This factional policy gradually led to what we 
have today. 
  I fear very much that the president's speech will serve as a 
kind of sign that we should reject the reforms and go into 
reverse. This is no longer possible as going into reverse is 
suicide for Russia, a path back to where we have come from. I 
do not call this system totalitarian or anything else. It was 
simply a system where the flywheel of the cost-led economy 
turned with terrible force, sucking all the strength out of 
people and using up all natural resources and so on. But it is 
our misfortune that this flywheel continues to turn today. 
People work but they are told: We will not pay your wages. 
But his cannot happen! It might end in an outburst. 
Therefore, the government has today been forced to turn on the 
printing presses, turn on the currency-issuing mechanism, and 
put out the flames. But, by switching on the currency-issuing 
mechanism, the government, the Central Bank, and our authorities 
in general are beginning to provoke hyperinflation. As the 
saying goes, go left and you'll lose your horse; go right and 
you'll lose your life. The government is in this most difficult 
of positions today. 
  I consider that we have no alternative route today. In 
order to survive, we will certainly have to jettison our gold 
and diamond reserves, and we will possibly have to sell several 
sources of major concessions to save the country from the threat 
of impending disaster. 
  The most important thing -- which I also mentioned two years 
ago -- is that we should devolve some functions of the federal 
authorities to the regional level. We should not give them 
political power but economic power, power of management. 
Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the the apparatus in Moscow 
by a factor of 25-30 and send it there. Then the regions will 
save Russia for us, I assure you. [Poltoranin ends] 

<H5>    Specific Steps Awaited </H5>
  Viktor Stepanov, Federation Council deputy and chairman of 
the Republic of Karelia Supreme Soviet: 
  In his speech the president only set out the points in his 
message to the Federal Assembly. Even a cursory analysis of the 
message's 100-page text shows that the proposals in this 
document with regard, among other things, to problems of the 
economic reform, strengthening federalism, and the development 
of the market go much further here than in the form they were 
presented in the Kremlin. 
  The president called on society for reconciliation and 
accord 
in 1994; however, without the economy becoming revived, that is 
revived and not stabilized, inasmuch as protectionism is 
required at the level of surgical intervention, Russia's economy 
cannot be saved. If there are still discount-credit rates of 
more than 200 percent from the Central Bank, if the attitude 
toward rural areas is still so irresponsible -- after all the 
peasants have not yet been paid the astronomical debt of 3 
trillion due them -- it will hardly be possible to talk of 
reviving the economy. 
  Frankly, I expected more precise and specific targets for 
the 
government with regard to the economy's revival in the 
president's speech. In particular, there should, in my opinion, 
have been a statement about the undesirability of changing 
prices for energy sources this year, because our producers -- 
whatever form of ownership they enjoy -- will not manage to get 
used to the new prices. 
  The president went on to emphasize in his message that the 
tax burden is fairly large and that it is necessary to change 
taxation policy. But again, logic would dictate that specific 
steps should be initiated by the president himself; after all, 
as recently as 22 December he signed an edict which actually 
proposes raising taxes for producers -- whatever form of 
ownership they enjoy -- and simply makes them bankrupt. In the 
context of enterprises becoming bankrupt, and thousands of 
workers simply beginning to live by begging, it will, perhaps, 
be very difficult to talk of national accord.

  [Text] Russian radio and television broadcasts in the near 
abroad could be halted soon, because in practice no funds are 
being allocated from the Russian budget for this purpose. A RIA 
correspondent was told this by Sergey Yerofeyev, director for 
international links at the All-Russian State Television and 
Radio Company. He said that in line with existing global 
practice, a country or a specific television and radio station 
broadcasting a program within its territory from another state 
must not only itself accept the expenditure involved, but often 
also pay considerable money for the right to relay these 
programs. In the territories of the former Union everything is 
the other way around. 
  Except for Turkmenistan, Belarus, and certain other CIS 
countries, which have assumed responsibility for the expenditure 
involved, the other states are producing uncertainty by their 
statements that they cannot pay for the reception of Russian 
television and radio broadcasts.

  [Text] Moscow, 28 Feb -- All forms of the Armed Forces of 
Russia without exception will be subjected to internal 
reorganization aimed at reducing them in the near future. This 
was stated today by Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of 
General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia, replying to a 
question from the ITAR-TASS correspondent regarding the fate of 
anti-aircraft defense, the Navy, and other structures of the 
Defense Department. He did, however, point out specifically 
that the Ministry of Defense is not yet "ready to bring all the 
arms of the forces into a single integrated structure." Any 
reshaping will, in the opinion of the military leader, 
invariably bring in its wake disruption of the administration 
system, which must not be permitted.

  [Text] Moscow, 28 Feb -- Journalists noticed today that one 
of those freed from the Lefortovo prison, Andrey Dunayev, was in 
the State Duma. He went to the 18th floor where the office of 
Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin is situated. 
  For a comment on this fact one can quote Georgiy Satarov, 
the 
Russian Federation president's aide, who said today that after 
speaking to Ivan Rybkin, it became clear to him that the 
chairman of the chamber and its deputies feel that they are 
responsible for the behavior of those whom they had freed. In 
order to preserve their reputation of supporters of reforms, the 
Duma leaders are apparently trying to obtain promises of 
trustworthiness from the organizers of the October events in 
Moscow.

<F P=106> [Speech delivered by Russian State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin </F>
to 23 February State Duma sitting: "Ivan Rybkin: We Do Not 
View the Separation of Powers As Meaning Alienation, Still Less 
Rivalry Between Them"] 
  [Text] Esteemed Colleagues! The first six weeks of our 
difficult work are ending, the hopes people have pinned on us 
are great, and these hopes have been vindicated. Russia's Fifth 
State Duma is swiftly and confidently joining in the country's 
political life: motley, not entirely intelligible, with its own 
complex and sometimes audacious character. 
  What do people expect of it, what are its intentions and 
commitments? Do they match society's mood and aspirations? 
What place will the State Duma occupy in the Russian system of 
power and what will be its fate? After all, the fate of its 
four prerevolutionary predecessors was not always enviable, and 
the same goes for its immediate predecessors -- the Russian 
Federation Supreme Soviet and Congress of People's Deputies. 
  Newspapers, the radio, television, analysts, and political 
scientists are edgy, voters are perturbed, and deputies 
themselves are suffering. Today we must provide direct, frank 
answers to these questions. And above all, the Duma has no 
intention of merely being an observer of the course of events, 
the Duma intends to work. 
  Point one. The Duma is completing its organizational process 
and would already have completed it were it not for certain 
difficulties with the "Procrustean bed" of the site of its 
residence. It is an impermissible luxury now to lose tempo in 
work, to waste the time allotted to the Duma, and, most 
importantly of all, to waste the mighty human and intellectual 
potential of the deputies elected with hope and great belief by 
Russians 12 December last year by failing to call upon it. 
Nevertheless, the deputies' factions and groups and the 23 
committees have joined in work on the key spheres of creative 
lawmaking -- the urgent problems of the economy and domestic and 
foreign policy -- with unhurried expert analysis, open 
parliamentary hearings, and pithy and turbulent debates. 
  Point two. The State Duma publicly says today that it does 
not see the separation of powers as meaning alienation between 
them, still less rivalry, bitterness, and even hostility. It is 
firmly convinced that in order to emerge from the crisis our 
motherland Russia needs civil peace, accord, tranquillity, and 
creation. It is precisely this kind of accord and collaboration 
between the president, government, Federation Council, State 
Duma, and Constitutional Court that Russians expect today, and 
keenly expect. They are waiting for the accord and interaction, 
mutual support, and respectful relations announced to the whole 
country and the whole world and professed in everyday work. 
Without this our presence here, in the country's highest power 
structures, becomes simply meaningless. 
  The first weeks of joint work are encouraging and inspire 
confidence, because this work has been supported by the common 
will of the president, the chairman of the government, the 
Federation Council, the State Duma, and the Constitutional 
Court. This has been noticed in Russia and beyond its borders, 
noticed with joy and relief, although life is still hard and 
complex. And this is precious. This is perhaps the main result 
of the small amount of work we have done over this short time. 
  Point three. The State Duma, spoiling the fun of many 
observers who were ready to watch a Russian-style gladiatorial 
battle, firmly intends to devote itself to legislative support 
for intelligent political, economic, and social reforms. Not 
much time is allotted for our lawmaking. Unfortunately, it runs 
to barely 20 calendar months. The stock of social patience is 
small and is running out. We have made our first stab at 
preparing a plan of lawmaking activity. It incorporates 
legislative proposals from the president, the government, the 
Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, and the Superior Court 
of Arbitration, and also legislative initiatives from Federation 
components and the deputies of Russia's parliament. 
  What are our priorities here? First of all there is the 
package of new federal constitutional laws based on developing 
Russia's new Constitution, without which election of the next, 
sixth Duma and the other branches of power, and also their 
functioning and collaboration are inconceivable. 
  The second package is the package of economic laws along 
with 
strict control of the budget and the elaboration of a program of 
priority anticrisis measures in order to emerge from the 
all-embracing crisis. Progress along the road of significant, 
productive reforms understood by every Russian involving a 
change in ownership relations and the formation of a government 
for people is impossible without them. 
  At the same time the two packages of laws create the 
framework of a rule-of-law federative state -- the basis for the 
activity of the next, sixth Duma -- and affirm the rights and 
freedom of the individual as the supreme value of the state and 
society on the basis of the unshakability and state integrity of 
the Russian Federation. The latter must be stipulated firmly, 
confidently, and calmly in order not to create the slightest 
illusions in all manner and caliber of Russian separatists, who 
have not yet received a proper political and economic caution, 
and it is probably now time to do so. 
  In the same way it is time to adopt proper laws to curb the 
aggression of the criminal world while, however, giving even 
those who have once stumbled the opportunity, the chance to take 
part in the difficult transformations of the country by 
declaring an amnesty for persons convicted of economic crimes 
and by supporting the president's legislative initiative 
regarding an amnesty in connection with the adoption of the new 
Russian Federation Constitution. Moreover, in order to ensure 
civil peace and accord in society we should declare an amnesty 
for all participants in the events of 19-21 August 1991 and 1 
May and 21 September-4 October 1993. Without this it is simply 
impossible to avoid suspicion and malicious, sometimes sly 
waiting for certain changes and a possible settling of scores -- 
in order to emerge from the all-embracing crisis. We are simply 
doomed to accord. 
  Esteemed Deputies, the crisis being experienced by the 
country and society is multifaceted and all-embracing. It will 
be difficult to emerge from it. We need genuine consolidation 
of society and a kind of Russian social contract-accord with a 
coordinating role played by President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin. 
  A large group of young, vigorous economist deputies inside 
the Duma, with the support of Russia's economic schools, have 
completed in general outline the preparation of a consolidated 
program of priority measures to emerge from the grave crisis. 
This program is no secret to the members of the government. 
The program was presented in detail at parliamentary hearings 
and has been covered in the press. It would certainly become 
the basis for the future reorganization of the government as a 
government of people's trust and national accord, with the 
president playing an active coordinating role, based on a real 
and significant parliamentary majority possessing the requisite 
legitimacy, professionalism, and intellectual potential. The 
government's membership certainly does not necessarily have to 
be expanded to include deputies. The main thing is for its 
members to be professionals dedicated to the cause of reforms 
for the good of Russians. This would put a stop to the 
variations on the theme of what and whom the government and its 
chairman rely on in forming the cabinet. This would impart the 
desired stability to the executive branch of power while 
restoring the controllability of the country's economy, lowering 
the rate of inflation [and] carrying out a number of pressing 
unpopular but urgent measures while evenly distributing the 
burden of the crisis among regions and social groups. 
  We have no time to waste on strife or petty arguments. We 
are entitled to work thoroughly and smoothly, and we must do so: 
the preparation of draft laws in our committees (essentially 
miniature parliaments proportionally representing all factions 
and groups), the coordination of positions in the Duma Council, 
where all factions and groups are also represented, the final 
adoption of draw laws at plenary sittings of the State Duma 
without cluttering up its time with petty, clever inessentials, 
which must be examined within the text of a law or outside it 
during the first two stages in preparing a draft law. Then the 
remaining 94 plenary sessions of the Duma will be productive and 
we will be able to fulfill our mission as a transitional 
parliament. 
  I have one more comment. We are forming the new working 
apparatus of the Russian State Duma. It must be stable 
[malosmenyayemyy] and adequate. Then the sixth Duma will 
inherit it in a good, effective condition. But there is one 
essential condition: In the State Duma it is the deputy who 
counts. This must be stated without arrogance and conceit. The 
Duma's working apparatus must assist the deputy in his effective 
work. If those who are seeking to join the apparatus have 
anything else in mind, they had better not seek to join it. 
  Esteemed Colleagues! In order to implement all this, which 
we have painfully arrived at and derived over these two and a 
half months, it is proposed to vote on and adopt as a package a 
State Duma decree on adopting a memorandum of accord on an 
amnesty in connection with the adoption of the Russian 
Federation Constitution, on an amnesty for certain crimes 
committed in the sphere of political and economic activity, and 
on deeming null and void the decision by the Russian Federation 
State Duma of 18 February on setting up a commission to 
investigate the causes and conditions of the events of 21 
September-4 October 1994. Thank you, and I ask representatives 
of the factions to speak on this topic.

  [Text] A news conference was held to discuss the results 
of a Cabinet of Ministers meeting, which had to find ways of 
overcoming the payments crisis. In the opinion of observers, 
the top-level participation (two vice premiers -- V. Yevtukhov 
and V. Landyk; ministers: of economy -- R. Shpek, finance -- H. 
Pyatachenko, and agriculture -- Yu. Karasyk; chairman of 
Ukraine's National Bank V. Yushchenko; and chairman of the State 
Coal Industry Committee M. Surhay) is an obvious attempt to 
attach a positive image to the Cabinet of Ministers prior to 
discussing this issue at the Supreme Council session. As 
regards specific decisions, the meeting adopted three 
resolutions: On hard-currency regulation, on the introduction 
into circulation of bills of exchange, and on the revision of 
the taxation system, something that, as the members of 
government assert, will create that normative foundation which 
will make it possible to extricate the credits and finance 
system from the crisis. It is, in particular, envisaged that 
from now on, the currency exchange rates will be set on a weekly 
basis, and the enterprises will be allowed to sell at free 
prices 50 percent of their currency profit at currency auctions. 
With regard to the circulation of bills of exchange, according 
to V. Yushchenko, there may be bankruptcies of those enterprises 
which, after purchasing products, will not be able to pay. The 
new taxation system envisages levying taxes on the profit in 
1995.

  [Text] Approximately 50 percent [figure as heard] of voters 
in Moldova voted in the pre-term parliamentary elections for the 
Agrarian Democratic Party [ADP]. Those running on the ADP list 
included Petr Lucinschi, the speaker of the present parliament, 
and Andrey Sangeli, the prime minister. In all, 73 percent of 
Moldovans took part in the elections. 
  Parties of leftwing orientation, running in the Socialist 
Party-Movement For Equal Rights and Unity bloc, scored an 
unexpected success, gaining 23 percent of the vote. The Popular 
Christian Democratic Front and the bloc of peasants and 
intellectuals, whose main aim is unification with Romania, 
gained approximately 14 percent of the votes. In fourth place, 
according to as yet preliminary figures, was the Social 
Democratic Party, which received 13 percent of the votes. 
  Political specialists in Moldova believe that a constructive 
majority will be formed in the new parliament which will favor 
the further strengthening of Moldovan statehood - in particular, 
the implementation of a balanced foreign policy - and closer 
economic integration with all republics of the Commonwealth.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Musiyenko report: "Askar Akayev: Russians Do Have </F>
a Future in Kyrgyzstan"] 
  [Text] The press conference held at the close of his 
official visit to Moscow by President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan 
was devoted to one of the most troublesome problems facing this 
republic -- the exodus of the Russian-speaking population. Over 
100,000 people -- 10 percent of those for whom Russian is their 
first language -- have left since the collapse of the Union,. 
  "I still consider the main aim and the main thrust of my 
policy to be the quest for and the strengthening of interethnic 
accord; and we must do everything within our power -- the 
possible and the impossible alike -- to halt the migration 
process," A. Akayev declared. 
  As he noted, teaching given in the Russian language in 
schools and higher educational establishments has been 
maintained in full in Kyrgyzstan, as has the training of 
teachers specializing in Russian. Moreover, a Russian Slavic 
University, where students from other Central Asian republics 
can study, was opened here recently -- the first and as yet the 
only one of its kind in the CIS. It is equally important, 
however, to solve the socioeconomic problems of Russians working 
at industrial enterprises, too. As A. Akayev announced, during 
his visit to Moscow he presented an entire package of agreements 
to B. Yeltsin, thanks to which the usual provision of plants and 
factories with orders from Russia would be maintained. And if 
there is work, there will be a comfortable standard of living 
for families. According to A. Akayev, these proposals "met with 
complete mutual understanding and support on the part of the 
Russian Federation president." 
  But nevertheless, joint efforts by all Commonwealth 
countries 
are required in order to regulate migration processes, A. Akayev 
stressed. Kyrgyzstan submitted a draft multilateral agreement 
on protecting the rights and interests of national minorities 
back in 1991. But, alas, after it was amended, all that 
remained of it were empty declarations. In A. Akayev's view, it 
is worth returning to the draft of this document at the next 
meeting of CIS heads of states. Its basic provisions are as 
follows: First, adequate representation of national minorities 
in the state administration system; second, refusal to 
countenance discrimination against persons who do not speak the 
national languages of the new independent states; and, finally, 
a solution to the problem of dual citizenship.

  [Text] In today's traditional Monday radio interview, Head 
of the Georgian State Eduard Shevardnadze declared that the 
Geneva meeting has once again revealed the true colors of 
separatism which is acting purposefully and aspiring to reach 
its pre-arranged goal. Separatists are obviously "frightened" 
of peace. In case of a peaceful settlement, all criminal acts 
perpetrated by them against mankind will be unveiled -- 
thousands of people shot without trial, dozens of villages 
burned to the ground, and the ruined lives of people of many 
nationalities, Georgians, Abkhazians, Russians, Greeks, and 
Armenians. If a peace agreement is signed, international 
observers who are to study the instances of genocide and ethnic 
cleansing will promptly arrive in Abkhazia. 
  The Georgian leader later stressed the positive of the 
Geneva 
talks, despite the disruption. 
  Mr. Shevardnadze mentioned that the Russian side, the United 
Nations, and the authorities of Great Britain, France, and 
Germany supported the Georgian side in its aspirations for a 
peaceful settlement of the Abkhaz conflict and that a new 
escalation of war must not be allowed. The stance taken by 
these countries must play a positive role in resolving this 
issue. "It is necessary to find new forms and formulae, and 
make a definite compromise in order to avoid the outbreak a new 
catastrophe which could assume an unprecedented scale," the head 
of the Georgian state declared. 
  The parliament chairman stressed that everything is now up 
to 
the security council. The United Nations, with Russian support, 
must justify the peacekeeping mission entrusted to it; and if 
Russia plays the role of a guarantor of peace and stability, 
then it will be a new landmark in world politics and positively 
affect not only the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict but also those 
world issues which need to be resolved immediately. 
  When assessing recent Russian events connected with the 
adoption of the law on amnesty for the August and October 
putschists, Shevardnadze said that this action could complicate 
the internal political situation in Russia if the leadership of 
the country fails to control the situation independently without 
the influence of external factors. 
  Commenting on his forthcoming visit to the United States, 
the 
Georgian leader said that besides a meeting with the U.S. 
President, consultations with representatives of the World Bank 
and the IMF and also with the leaders of various U.S. government 
departments are planned. 
  Eduard Shevardnadze especially singled out one of the 
essential points at the forthcoming Georgian-U.S. meeting: a 
more detailed familiarization of the U.S. administration with 
the Abkhaz conflict.

  [Excerpts] Vilnius, Feb 28, BNS -- Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas said he was surprised by the Russian 
parliament's decision to amnesty the leaders of the 1991 Soviet 
coup and the hard-liners who fought against President Boris 
Yeltsin last October. 
  At a press conference Monday, Brazauskas noted that the step 
was premature because there has been no legal evaluation of the 
actions undertaken by the organizers and the executors of those 
events. "Maybe they would have been acquitted in court -- that 
is a different question." 
  Commenting on Lithuanian-Russian relations, Brazauskas said 
no changes have occurred lately. The president praised the 
Lithuanian government's initiative to find out why Russia does 
not send ratification documents to the agreement on the most 
favored nation trade status. [passage omitted] 
  Brazauskas said he has not yet had a change to read the 
Russian draft agreement on military transit through Lithuania. 
The president said he expect the head of the working group for 
talks with the CIS to acquaint him with the document this week. 
  In Brazauskas' words, misunderstandings over Russian 
military 
transit can be avoided by improving the currently existing order 
of transit. 
  A system of permits must remain and must "function very 
precisely," he said. 
  He said it is an "oddity" that having declared the need to 
demilitarize the Kaliningrad region as soon as possible, 
Lithuania suddenly suspends Russian transit through its 
territory. 
  Brazauskas said Lithuania should create uniform transit 
rules 
for all countries in the future.

  [Text] MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has learned form reliable 
sources that the officer corps of the Russian Armed Forces grew 
by 3,000 men in 1993 at the expense of the Armed Forces of CIS 
countries. 
  Officers from these armies leave the service to sign up 
immediately with the Russian Armed Forces. For instance, over 
1,000 officers deserted the Kazakhstani Army for the Russian 
one; from Belarus, 800 officers; and from Ukraine, 1,000. For 
the most part, these are Air Force pilots and Missile Troops 
servicemen. They have been lured into the Russian Army by 
higher wages. 
  It is expected that this year the flow of deserters, 
particularly from Kazakhstan, will grow, not drop. In 
Kazakhstan, they have started levying income taxes on servicemen 
and stripped them of some of their former benefits.

<F P=106> [From the "Panorama" program] </F>
  [Text] A news conference was held in Moscow today on the 
results of the session of the defense ministers of the CIS 
countries. Kirill Shakhnovich reports. 
  [Shakhnovich] Taking part in this session from 24-25 
February 
were delegations of the military departments of eleven states of 
the Commonwealth. The session resulted in the adoption and 
signing of such important documents as: 
  -- a decision on the confirmation of the statute on the 
council of defense ministers; 
  -- a decision on the secretariat of the council of defense 
ministers of the participating states; 
  -- a decision on the establishment of the coordination staff 
and the principles of its makeup; 
  -- a decision on additional measures for the stabilization 
of 
the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border; and also, 
  -- a decision on the period of the presence of collective 
peacekeeping forces in the Republic of Tajikistan; 
  -- a decision on the interstate commission for military- 
technological cooperation of the CIS member-states; this 
decision is popular because even those countries who do not 
participate in this bloc can come to this commission and because 
the problem of replenishment of military spare parts is a highly 
acute one for all armies today. 
  And the final point, which was signed by the eleven states 
of 
the Commonwealth, refers to the preparation of draft documents 
on the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the victory in the 
Great Fatherland War of 1941-1945. 
  Here in particular is what was said at today's news 
conference by Viktor Samsonov, the head of the staff for 
coordination of the armed forces of the CIS Countries: 
  [Begin Samsonov recording] As for seeking to set up a system 
of collective security, this of course involves the signing of a 
treaty on collective security, and we propose that at some point 
we shall set up joint armed forces of the Commonwealth countries 
which will form the basis of a system of collective security of 
the whole Commonwealth, and of each state individually. There 
is an analogy here with the NATO bloc, but without rejecting 
totally the experience of NATO, which has functioned for a long 
time now, I would say that there is much in the experience of 
the CIS states that is its own and special to it, experience 
which has not come directly from other states, but of course 
there will be mutual experience. 
  However, the setting up of collective security naturally is 
being more and more understood among the states of the 
Commonwealth, and this is shown by the preceding session in 
Ashgabat, where another three states entered the signing of the 
treaty on collective security. [end recording]

staff for coordination and cooperation -- will be more 
international. Whereas the majority of positions were taken 
earlier by officers of Russia, now 50 percent of the staff has 
been assigned to the republics. But the collective security 
will be financed in the same proportion. 
  All in all, there will remain 240 people on the staff's 
payroll. Its work will be directed by the chairman of the 
Defense Ministers council. This position will be filled in turn 
by generals from all the republics. Russian Deputy Defense 
Minister Boris Gromov has been appointed the first chairman. 
The new staff will also have a permanent position, that of 
deputy chairman. He will be Colonel General Samsonov, chief of 
staff of the CIS Joint Armed Forces High Command. The deputy 
chairman was also granted the right to vote over Russia's 
objections.

  [Text] An open two-day sitting of CIS 
coordinating-consultative committee (CCC) headed by Russia's 
Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin started its work on Tuesday 
[1 March] in Moscow. The sitting is to discuss a package of 
agreements on practical implementation of the treaty on economic 
union between the Commonwealth's countries. 
  The conference is to consider a protocol to the agreement 
concerning general conditions and mechanisms to support 
development of cooperation between industrial enterprises and 
the various sectors, an agreement on cooperation in the sphere 
of labor migration and social security for workers-migrants. 
  In addition, the session is scheduled to discuss a package 
of 
documents of a humanitarian nature: on benefits and guarantees 
to the veterans of the WW ll, Afghan war veterans, and families 
of perished servicemen, on preparation for the celebration of 
the 50th anniversary of Victory Day, on citizens' rights in the 
sphere of benefits and compensations for children, as well as 
other issues. 
  The vice premiers will first discuss proposals to the agenda 
of the upcoming summit of heads of CIS governments and states. 
  According to Korotchenya, the session is supposed to discuss 
a package of military problems as well. 
  Korotchenya reported to Interfax that the issue on Ukraine's 
joining the economic union as an associate member had not been 
prepared yet. He explained that it is difficult to solve this 
issue in a situation where Kiev has not signed the CIS Charter 
nor other important documents of the Commonwealth, has not 
determined the conditions and mechanisms for Ukraine's 
participation in CIS projects. 
  Korotchenya added that the issue on Ukraine's associate 
membership in the economic union would be probably solved at the 
summit of CIS leaders. 
  As Korotchenya, CIS executive secretary, said, Kazakhstan's 
Prime Minister Sergei Tereshchenko voiced an initiative to unite 
separate sittings of the council of heads of governments and the 
council of the heads of states scheduled for March into a joint 
sitting on March 31 in Moscow. The present task of the CCC is 
to prepare documents for a CIS summit. 
  Korotchenya also reported that in the course of his meeting 
with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev on Monday in Moscow 
they reached an agreement to hold a joint session of the CIS 
Council of Foreign Ministers and CIS Council of Defense 
Ministers.

  [Text] Moscow March 2 TASS -- PRAVDA runs a statement by 
former Russian Prosecutor-General Aleksey Kazannik, who, in 
explanation of his resignation, maintains that he was 
pressurised on the part of President Boris Yeltsin, since a 
message from Baturin, assistant to the president on state 
security, suggested that "the act of amnesty be not enacted or 
be at least dragged out". In this connection Kazannik 
emphasises that "the prosecutor's office has not right to 
legislative initiative. It does not discuss acts but accurately 
and undeviatingly applies normative-legal acts". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI reports that "upon release, Russia's 
former 
Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy applied to former parliament 
speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov in a proposal to convene an 
extraordinary congress of the people's deputies of Russia. This 
was announced on Tuesday by presidential chief of staff Sergey 
Filatov when he was introducing Aleksey Ilyushenko to the staff 
of the office of the prosecutor-general. Ilyushenko was 
appointed acting prosecutor- general of the Russian Federation 
by a presidential decree." 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on recent developments: "The events of the 
recent days have shown once again the weakness of state power, 
the need to strengthen which was mentioned by the president in 
his message to the Federal Assembly. Not just the weakness of 
all its elements but complete mismatch in their functioning. 
  "It has turned out that we have got a not so strong 
constitution if the need for its interpretation arose when it 
was necessary to take a serious decision" 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the crisis of power in Moscow: 
  "All maintain that the current crisis of power in Moscow has 
been provoked by the State Duma's well-known decision on a 
political amnesty. However, it is now clear that the crisis was 
triggered by no means by the Duma decision but by the attitude 
of former Prosecutor-General Aleksey Kazannik (and, apparently, 
that of former chief of the Federal Counterintelligence Service 
Nikolay Golushko). 
  "Presidential assistants' incoherent reasoning, because of 
which they are blamed for lack of professionalism and 
efficiency, proves not the lack of the assistants' 
professionalism but the non- professinalism of the order issued 
to them -- to give explanations at a press conference. How can 
they give explanations when Kazannik is backed by law and they 
are backed only by their boss's instruction?" 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with State Duma 
speaker Ivan Rybkin, who expresses his opinion about the 
announced amnesty. He said "the amnesty is intended for a 
sufficiently long period of time. According to the president's 
legislative initiative, a total of 222,000 people are to be 
released from places of confinement, plus those who were 
involved in the events of the August of 1991, May, September and 
October 1993. 
  "It so happened that due to insufficiently efficient 
interaction of authorities, there was a certain inconsistency in 
the realisation of the decisions taken. All this undoubtedly 
brings about certain problems in society," Rybkin said. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an article by Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev. 
  "It has long become clear that in present-day conditions an 
aggressive nationalism, the Brezhnev and 'Berlin Wall' 
doctrines, domination ambitions, and 'sanitary cordones' are 
unacceptable," he writes. 
  "It is now essential to ensure stability and security for 
the 
entire Europe and jointly overcome ethnic conflicts... it is 
important now not to lose the positive movement momentum created 
by Presdient Boris Yeltsin's initiative which led to a major 
breakthrough in lifting the siege of Sarajevo. 
  "Energetic and joint actions are necessary. Individual 
powers and their associations, including NATO, will find their 
place and make their contributions within the context of 
combined efforts". 
  VECHERNYY PETERBURG reports that the assembly of lower 
panels 
in the Amber Room of the Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo is 
nearing completion. Over the past nine years local restorers 
have made anew almost 40 percent of panels. 
  The main restoring work will apparently have to be suspended 
because not a single gramme of amber has come from Kaliningrad 
over a period of almost three years. All amber is exported from 
there at commercial prices.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Defense Ministry Press Service in </F>
Kiev; date not given] 
  [Text] Some mass media have reported on a declaration made 
on 26 February by Anatoliy Lupynis, leader of the Ukrainian 
National Assembly [UNA], at a meeting of Kiev intellectuals. In 
particular, the declaration pointed out that the Ukrainian 
Defense Ministry had allegedly drafted a project to be discussed 
by the Ukrainian and Russian presidents. The project provides 
for the building of Russian military bases in Ukraine. 
According to Lupynis, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry had 
suggested that Russian laws be applied on the territories of 
those bases. 
  The Ukrainian Defense Ministry Press Service points out that 
the information provided by Mr. Lupynis regarding the 
possibility of locating Russian military facilities on the 
territory of our state is unsubstantiated. Such actions would 
contradict Ukraine's current laws, and allegations that the 
Defense Ministry either prepared or discussed a similar project 
are groundless. 
  Unfortunately, under the conditions of the current harsh 
political contests, some politicians are trying to gain 
political capital at all costs, even by defaming the Armed 
Forces. The declaration by the UNA leader is proof of this.

  [Text] Kiev -- A UNIAN correspondent has learned from 
informal sources on 1 March that President of Ukraine Leonid 
Kravchuk received a letter from U.S. President Bill Clinton 
recommending that Minister of Economy Roman Shpek be appointed 
Ukraine's new prime minister. Observers from government circles 
connect the American President's inclination toward Roman Shpek 
with the success of the Ukrainian Government delegation's 
negotiations in Washington at the end of January 1994. UNIAN 
was unable to obtain official confirmation of this report by the 
press service of the president and the Cabinet of Ministers.

<F P=106> [News conference by President Leonid Kravchuk for foreign </F>
journalists on his visit to the United States in Kiev on 1 March 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Kravchuk] The official visit by the president of 
Ukraine to the United States will begin on 3 March and will be 
the second official visit to the United States. I am convinced 
that after we signed the trilateral agreement in Moscow, this 
visit will become a turning point in the establishment of 
relations between Ukraine and the United States. Another thing 
I would like to emphasize is the fact that the preparation for 
the visit is taking place in a good atmosphere. All the issues 
put on the agenda, and all the draft agreements upon which the 
experts are working, agree with the interests of both Ukraine 
and the United States. 
  I attach great importance to this visit, and hope that our 
plans and forecasts will be accomplished. Now I am ready to 
answer your questions. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] [Words indistinct] Radio 
Liberty 
Russian service. Esteemed Mr. President, after your statement 
of 18 February this year [words indistinct] that you believe 
early presidential elections inexpedient, do you realize that in 
the eyes of the U.S. Administration and the entire Western 
community, because the parliament of Ukraine in fact failed to 
ratify the January agreement, you remain the sole guarantor of 
its implementation? 
  [Kravchuk] I will start from the end: I do not think the 
parliament failed to ratify it. The parliament ratified START-I 
and made the decision to exchange instruments of ratification, 
and the parliament lifted its reservations on Paragraph 5 of the 
Lisbon Protocol, which is interpreted as Ukraine's commitment to 
join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] as a nonnuclear 
state. Thus, the parliament did not fail in anything, but made 
an important step forward. Another thing is that the parliament 
did not ratify the NPT -- that is also true. 
  Second, my statement had to do with the situation that 
emerged today and that can emerge, according to the forecasts, 
in April, May, or June. I explained this both in my interview 
for Radio Liberty and in my interview for our television. I 
never say everything at once, however; I always leave some room 
for future clarification. You know that the parliament's 
decisions on early elections of the parliament and president 
were made under the pressure of a miners' strike. I agreed that 
such elections were needed, but I do not agree that it should 
become customary in the life of the society for elections and 
re-elections to be held under the pressure of a strike. 
Agreeing to that sort of thing, one will have to agree that we 
are not building a civilized or a law-governed society. My 
participation in an early election would mean that I agree to 
that. That is why I am saying this to emphasize that I have 
stood and do stand for a law-governed and civilized state, and I 
will do my best to ensure that this state is being built in 
Ukraine. Therefore, the president may agree to any steps 
required by the situation at hand, but his personal involvement 
would mean that he agrees, not only theoretically but also 
practically, with an unlawful situation. 
  [Rudenko] Larysa Rudenko, SVOBODA newspaper. Mr. President, 
a body has been set up within the Cabinet of Ministers to deal 
with clearing up enterprises. Does that mean that large 
emissions will be launched again? Which enterprises, do you 
think, need to be saved from bankruptcy? 
  [Kravchuk] First, those that manufacture products needed for 
Ukraine must be saved. Also those that manufacture products 
that can be sold and bring hard currency to Ukraine must be 
saved. Those that will be of crucial significance in the future 
structure of Ukraine's economy must be saved. There is no point 
in saving the rest, which manufacture products that may not be 
needed in the future and may not be competitive in quality and 
technological standards. This is a conceptual principle that 
was also voiced in Russian President Yeltsin's address to the 
joint session of the Federal Assembly and Duma. He also 
emphasized that Russia would manufacture products needed for 
Russia. Taking this into account, I think that Belarus will 
also manufacture products needed for Belarus which can also be 
competitive. Taking this into account we must create a market 
in the CIS instead of crying over broken ties. If we should 
restore, as some wish, all the ties, we will have to restore the 
Soviet Union and the entire Soviet economy. 
  The budget and the decisions made by the Cabinet of 
Ministers 
have nothing to do with the emission. They have to do only with 
those problems that are agreed upon today with the Cabinet of 
Ministers and the National Bank concerning the granting of 
appropriate credits to enterprises needed for Ukraine. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, as far as I 
understand, the issue of providing Ukraine with guarantees is 
not in a very good state. Do you think that your visit to the 
United States can improve the situation in this respect, because 
we understand this situation has to do with the attitude of the 
U.S. Administration? 
  [Kravchuk] I do not think that anything will change on paper 
regarding the guarantees. The trilateral agreement in Moscow, a 
document that the three of us signed, ties guarantees to 
Ukraine's accession to the NPT. That is, the issue of 
guarantees has been resolved in principle, but the provision of 
guarantees and putting them in a documented form is tied to 
Ukraine's accession to the NPT. I do not think this position 
will be called into question or will be subject to change. 
Another matter is that we will be able to clarify again 
conceptually the essence and the nature of guarantees, textually 
and conceptually. The provision of guarantees, however, I must 
stress, is tied to Ukraine's accession to the NPT. 
  [Unidentified correpondent] Will the instruments of 
ratification be exchanged in Washington, and if not, where? The 
second question, apart from $350 million, what other aid do you 
expect from the United States? Third, can you explain to 
American readers, how can an independent Ukraine that is outside 
Russia's sphere of interest be within the U.S. sphere of 
interests? 
  [Kravchuk] I will have, if nothing changes, a telephone 
conversation today with U.S. President Bill Clinton, and we will 
agree upon the issue of exchange of ratification instruments. 
This needs to be agreed by both sides, not only by Ukraine. 
The second question on the U.S. aid, specifically the $300 
million: With all the importance of $300 million, or even a 
lesser figure, for Ukraine, I am going to America not for the 
$300 million, but for the establishment of large-scale economic 
cooperation. To revive Ukraine's economy on market foundations 
and for Ukraine to join market structures, including European 
and world ones, we need billions in funds, powerful investments, 
an influx of private capital, and others. All this needs 
establishment of large-scale economic cooperation. 
  For your third question -- it is a rather original one, 
implying certain complications, both politically and otherwise. 
Ukraine is a member of the CIS, and as a member of the CIS, it 
is placed within a political, economic, and legal area 
determined by the CIS documents. The CIS documents do not 
preclude any state from joining other structures, in Europe or 
worldwide, including political ones. 
  We in Ukraine understand very well that Ukraine, and not 
only 
Ukraine, but also other European countries -- I mean the 
European countries of the CIS and the former Warsaw Pact -- are 
today under a certain influence of the Russian policy. The 
question is, what kind of influence is it? Is that an influence 
of democratic and market- oriented transformations, or is it an 
influence which certain political forces in Russia want to 
impose today? We are in favor of cooperation, partnership, and 
interaction with Russia. Everybody must understand, however, 
that Russia will never resign itself to playing a mediocre role 
in the world. Russia cannot renounce its thousand-year-old 
history; this would not be understood either by the Russians or 
by Russian politicians. The question is, how can we prevent the 
transformation of this concept into an imperial one? Therefore, 
we cannot set ourselves euphoric goals, to have Russia suddenly 
renounce its role in the world and in Europe. It is unfeasible. 
However, we -- I mean Ukraine -- can and want to give an 
opportunity to the states of the world to balance out the 
politics in Europe. 
  I would even say that we can, given the will and assistance 
to Ukraine, open the road for democracy to the east, from 
Europe's old borders. We can also play a certain part in the 
creation of a [word indistinct] market in Central Europe and 
further east. Thus, I am talking about a stabilizing role for 
Ukraine. However, to see that happen, the Western countries 
must decide whether they can assist Ukraine in this, while 
Ukraine is ready, because Ukraine currently has no political or 
conceptual complications in this respect. We all need to assist 
both Russia and Ukraine, and others, in the development of 
democratic processes. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Do you think the refusal of the 
Supreme Council to join the NPT will affect the granting of aid 
to Ukraine by the United States? When do you expect Ukraine to 
join the NPT? Another question, will you discuss the issue of 
guaranteeing American investments by Ukraine? 
  [Kravchuk] I will reply in several theses. The first thesis 
is that, having ratified Paragraph 5 of the Lisbon Protocol, 
Ukraine in fact announced its commitment to join the NPT. I 
will try to convince the American business community, 
politicians, the President and the public that Ukraine has its 
peculiarity as a country having nuclear arms on its territory. 
The peculiarity is that Ukraine cannot use its nuclear arms and 
does not pose a potential threat to the United States. 
Therefore, the main thing is that Ukraine has practically begun 
to carry out the trilateral agreement signed in Moscow, thus 
creating favorable conditions for its relations with the United 
States. That is why there is no need to tie so closely all the 
documents and relations between Ukraine and the United States 
with accession to the NPT. Our accession has its specifics, 
because Ukraine, I stress again, is not a nuclear state. 
Moreover, everybody understands that even if someone should 
wish this, Ukraine will not be able any time soon to become a 
state that produces nuclear arms or has all the components of a 
nuclear state. 
  The guarantees for investments will be discussed. We have an 
agreement called Treaty Between Ukraine and the United States on 
the Encouragement and Mutual Safeguarding of Investments. This 
agreement has been fully coordinated and finalized. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] [Words indistinct] Mr. 
President, are you worried by the fact that if the election 
fails to take place in March, the situation can get out of hand 
and will not be possible to deal with by normal means? 
  [Kravchuk] Of course I am worried, but I attach greater 
importance to the economic situation, rather than to the 
question whether the election will take place or not, although I 
always stressed that I would like the election to take place at 
once. Even if the election fails to take place, there is an 
executive authority, there is a president, there are local power 
structures, presidential representatives, and councils that 
perform their functions today, and there will be no great 
complications. However, the economic situation can be 
complicated even by the problems involved during the election to 
the Supreme Council. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, you emphasized 
that a priority in your policy toward Washington is the 
expansion of economic relations with the United States. What 
can Ukraine offer to the United States, and what would you like 
to receive from the United States? 
  [Kravchuk] I would like the United States and the European 
states to actually settle the issue of quotas for Ukrainian 
goods, and then we would have a great deal to offer. This is 
first. Second, we have a rather powerful Black Sea shipping 
company, Blasco, but the main cargoes are carried not by our 
ships, but by ships of third countries. We could do this 
ourselves and make money. As for the United States, I stress 
again, I would wish for large-scale economic cooperation, to 
open the road for private investments, to open the road for 
investment, genuine trade, scientific, and technical cooperation 
in all areas. Then we would feel a real boost to economic 
transformations in Ukraine and to normal cooperation in the 
economy. I would say this: Ukraine is a young state and does 
not have a lot of experience. The United States, with its 
possibilities and experience, could lead Ukraine to the economic 
market, the scientific market, the technological market, and 
give us an opportunity to work there, to sell and earn, and to 
buy. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] [Words indistinct] Mr. 
President, can you name all the agreements that are (?prepared 
for signing in Washington)? 
  [Kravchuk] The first agreement: Treaty Between Ukraine and 
the United States of America on the Encouragement and Mutual 
Safeguarding of Investments; second: Convention Between the 
Government of the United States and the Government of Ukraine on 
the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Tax Evasion 
in Respect of the Income and Capital Tax; third agreement: Joint 
Statement on the Main Principles of Cooperation in the Sphere of 
Agriculture; fourth: Statement of Intent on the Granting of 
Expertise in the Sphere of Agriculture Between the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Food of Ukraine and the Department of 
Agriculture of the United States; next, a document on the sphere 
of competence of the Ukrainian-American Joint Commission for 
Assistance to the Development of Trade and Investment. The 
other four agreements are at the stage of coordination. The 
first is a treaty between the Goods and Credit Corporation of 
the United States and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture of 
Ukraine; an agreement between the Governments of Ukraine and the 
United States on cooperation in the sphere of science and 
technology. Next, an agreement on protection and conservation 
of cultural heritage, and a joint statement on cooperation in 
the sphere of trade and economy. The last two have already been 
mentioned -- a charter and a treaty between the ministries of 
defense. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] [Question indistinct] 
  [Kravchuk] Well, Oksana Baiul is a world champion. I met 
her, if I recall, with a glass of champagne, and I greeted her 
as a world champion. Naturally, when I saw it on television, 
for me it was not just the joy of a human being. It was very 
important. It was the first time Ukraine appeared as an 
independent team, it was the first time it won two medals -- 
gold and bronze. Thus, Ukraine makes its appearance as a world 
power. It is important that it be represented by such young, 
beautiful, and gentle people as Oksana Baiul.

  [Text] Kiev -- At a regular briefing at Ukraine's Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs on 1 March, Anton Buteyko, adviser to the 
president on international issues, outlined the prospects for 
the visit of the Ukrainian delegation headed by President Leonid 
Kravchuk to Washington: prospects for cooperation in abolishing 
nuclear weapons, introducing economic reform, a Ukrainian 
national currency, broadening American investment in the 
Ukrainian economy, and so on. "We are talking not about 
assistance for Ukraine but about the beginning of normal 
economic relations between the two states," Anton Buteyko said. 
  He declined to name specific figures concerning U.S. 
financial participation in Ukrainian economic reforms but 
stressed that during the visit to the United States of the 
government delegation headed by Roman Shpek, this figure was 
adjusted three times. Anton Buteyko stated that relations 
between the United States and Ukraine became considerably warmer 
following the Ukrainian Supreme Council's definitive 
ratification of START I. 
  He also did not exclude the possibility that ratification 
certificates with regard to this treaty will be exchanged during 
Leonid Kravchuk's visit to the United States. "Our government 
delegation left 24 specific projects with the Americans for them 
to consider possible investment in the Ukrainian economy. Above 
all these are investments in nuclear energy and conversion of 
the military industrial complex. 
  Consultations are continuing with regard to the 
Ukrainian-U.S. charter on cooperation. Anton Buteyko told 
journalists that if all the formulations are finally agreed 
upon, it will be signed by the presidents of Ukraine and United 
States during Leonid Kravchuk's visit. 
  [Kiev Ukrayinske Radio First Program Network in Ukrainian at 
1500 GMT on 1 Mar 94 adds: "Anton Buteyko, head of the Ukrainian 
President's Foreign Issues Service, has deemed as an important 
step toward the development of bilateral Ukrainian-U.S. 
relations Leonid Kravchuk's official visit to the United States, 
scheduled for the beginning of March. Speaking at a Foreign 
Ministry briefing, Buteyko provided information on the program 
of the visit, pointing out that the latter's primary goal is to 
outline the major directions for expanding democratic 
cooperation, and to strengthen the positive trends in the 
relations between the two countries. Buteyko added that there 
are plans to sign a Ukrainian-U.S. charter on partnership, 
friendship, and cooperation that would blueprint interstate 
cooperation in the immediate future."]

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rudkowski] </F>
  [Excerpts] Today's session of the Supreme Soviet will see 
the announcement of the results of a roll-call vote on a package 
of bills related to the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus. 
One of these issues is the introduction of the post of 
president as the head of state and executive branch. The 
official results will be made known at 1800. With regard to the 
president -- who is eligible for this post and how they will be 
elected -- by nationwide elections or by people's deputies in 
this Oval Room? -- the Supreme Soviet should adopt an 
appropriate law. This extremely important issue concerning 
presidential elections is now in the hands of the people's 
deputies. [passage omitted] 
  Before discussion of the agenda for today's session, the 
Supreme Soviet was addressed by Chairman Mechyslaw Ivanavich 
Hryb. Here is an excerpt from his address: 
  [Begin Hryb recording] For some time now, especially after 
my election to the post of Supreme Soviet chairman, some media, 
in particular the papers SVABODA [in Minsk] and IZVESTIYA, 
started publishing reports that do not correspond to the facts. 
These publications compromise me as a man and the chairman of 
the Supreme Soviet. Esteemed People's Deputies! I want to 
assure you: It is not a question of my inability to defend my 
dignity and honor, to obtain justice in a legal way through the 
courts, and to punish the guilty. By the way, it happened once 
with regard to the SVABODA newspaper. The question is that I do 
not have time to bring any action in the courts. Therefore, I 
am forced to address you, People's Deputies, respected electors, 
and citizens of the Republic, and assure you that my program and 
my demands for establishing order and discipline in the 
Republic, as well as to strengthen the fight against crime are 
not liked by everyone. However, I assure all citizens of our 
Republic that I will not retreat from this course. [end 
recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with President Mircea Snegur by Svetlana Gamova </F>
in Chisinau; date not given: "Mircea Snegur: The Question of 
Unification With Romania Will Not Be Raised"] 
  [Text] Chisinau -- Winter and spring 1994 will be crucial 
for Moldova. A nationwide poll, scheduled for 6 March, will 
mark the end of the dispute between the supporters of an 
independent Moldova and those who want it to join Romania. 
  Hopes of a revival of the unity of the state, which for 
three 
years now has been "divorced" from two of its regions, the 
Dniester Region and the Gagauz south, are pinned on its results 
and on the results of the upcoming parliamentary elections. All 
the talks with these regions have ended in deadlock, foundering 
on the conditions that Chisinau must provide the regions with 
guarantees in the event of a change in Moldova's political 
status. 
  [Gamova] Mr. President, we know that you do not like sudden 
movements. But your announcement of a nationwide poll was just 
such a step. Before it, unification with Romania was talked of 
as a reality, albeit more or less remote, but the poll and 
particularly your speech at the congress of citizens, "Our Home 
is the Republic of Moldova," rule out this possibility. Why did 
you decide to set out your positions so clearly? 
  [Snegur] At the very beginning of the democratic 
transformations, following the 1990 elections, when I started 
work in the Moldovan parliament, I warned certain 
representatives of the People's Front that, as far as I was 
concerned, I would do my utmost to promote the land's 
prosperity, but I would not raise the question of unification 
with Romania. It is the first time I have said this, but that 
is what happened. In fact, in all the twists and turns of the 
state's development I have steered both partners and opponents 
onto a centrist path of solving problems. But recently the 
opposition set up a council for unification with Romania and 
started propagandizing this possibility and elevating it to the 
level of state policy. It was in order to ease the tension in 
society that I announced the "consultation with the people" -- 
our poll, which, incidentally, does not contradict the 
constitution. 
  [Gamova] Does such an overt rejection of the idea of 
unification with Romania mean a reorientation exclusively toward 
the CIS? 
  [Snegur] No. Incidentally, the "consultation with the 
people" includes a question relating to mutually advantageous 
links with all countries. We signed the agreement on the 
formation of an economic union and will sign all the other 
agreements deriving from this document. We established too many 
customs barriers, which disrupted links between the parts of 
what was once a single economic comnplex. As a result Moldova, 
like the other CIS countries, has suffered enormous losses. 
  Unless all the documents ensuring the viability of the 
economic union are signed by the heads of state in the very near 
future we will be unable to escape from this situation and get 
back at least to the position we had attained a few years ago. 
  Of course, we will also be seeking mutually advantageous 
links with Western countries. But it would be unwise to abandon 
the Eastern market, with which we have strong links. 
  [Gamova] Might Moldova eventually join the ruble zone? 
  [Snegur] There is no need for that. Calculations will 
certainly be made in relation to the ruble. But the Moldovan 
leu is doing pretty well. According to the IMF and the donor 
countries, Moldova is keeping pace with the Baltic countries in 
carrying out reforms. 
  [Gamovas] Will the Moldovan leadership's current stance 
affect relations with Romania? 
  [Snegur] A recent meeting of the two countries' 
interministerial commission in Bucharest summed up mutual 
economic relations and determined the paths of future 
development. The meeting took place after citizens at the "Our 
Common Home is the Republic of Moldova" congress in Chisinau had 
advocated the building of Moldova as an autonomous, independent 
state. There was no negative reaction on the part of the 
official authorities. 
  [Gamova] But the Moldovan leadership's position and your own 
stance have come under heavy attack in the Romanian press.... 
  [Snegur] But the attack was not at an official level, unless 
you consider the Romanian Academy of Sciences to be so. The 
political parties were negative by and large. But the 
opposition press in Moldova was even more vigorous and more 
abusive. Our path has been determined. And although the 
results of the poll have no legal force, they will provide the 
president with an argument for pursuing with parliament a policy 
supported by the people. 
  [Gamova] But what if the People's Front, which is running 
under new party labels in the elections, gains a majority in 
parliament? The president will then lose his expected support... 
  [Snegur] I am hoping for a reasonable majority in 
parliament. I think we will be able to form a viable new 
government too. But if things develop the way you suggest, it 
will be the will of the people. 
  [Gamova] Will the new parliament be able to resolve the 
problem of the Dniester Region and the south of the republic? 
  [Snegur] Yes, I think so. A draft law has been prepared on 
the status of the southern areas which have a high Gagauz 
population. It has been scrutinized at the Council of Europe 
and it suits the Gagauz themselves. The draft will be submitted 
for discussion at one of the first sittings of the new 
parliament. 
  [Gamova] What can the Gagauz realistically expect? 
  [Snegur] Autonomy within the republic -- something along the 
lines of an autonomous oblast with certain rights, with its own 
People's Assembly. The head of the entity's administration 
would be in the Moldovan government. 
  As for the Dniester Region, we have a good basis for a 
dialogue on its future status -- the CSCE mission's report. 
Judging by President Yeltsin's letter, Russia also accepts 
these documents, as mediator in the settlement of the Dniester 
Region conflict. 
  Russia's mediation mission began in July 1992, when Boris 
Yeltsin and I signed the ceasefire agreement. Some 18 months 
have now elapsed. During that time the joint peacemaking force 
monitoring the security zone has done a great deal to stabilize 
the situation. The agreement brokered by Russia and the CSCE on 
the legal status of the Dniester Region can then be implemented 
under the observation of guarantors, for example, the existing 
mechanism of the four -- Moldova, Russia, Ukraine, and Romania. 
  We are prepared to distribute functions between the central 
and local authorities and grant maximum self-government, down to 
the creation of their own legislative assembly and their own 
emblems. The only conditions is that the region should be part 
of the Republic of Moldova with a common army and common 
constitution. 
  [Gamova] Could Moldova have a federal structure? 
  [Snegur] I do not think there will be any need for that. 
Particularly if we guarantee the region the right to 
self-determination in the event of a change of status by 
Moldova. The problem must be resolved, otherwise the deadlock 
will continue. 
  [Gamova] Is agreement with the current Dniester Region 
leaders possible? 
  [Snegur] It is difficult, but we will try. 
  [Gamova] Final question: The 14th Army on the territory of 
Moldova. The negotiating process is under way, but there is 
much talk in the republic about the possibility of the creation 
of a Russian military base, using its facilities.... 
  [Snegur] We insist on the continuation of negotiations on 
the withdrawal of the 14th Army from Moldova. I have not heard 
any other official view from the Russian side. It is merely a 
matter of the date. We are insisting on the middle of this 
summer. This has not been agreed so far.

  [Text] Moldovan President Mircea Snegur has told INTERFAX 
that the country's newly-elected parliament is to consider and 
approve a new constitution which must secure the republic's 
independence and its development along the road of consolidation 
and strengthening of contacts with all countries. 
  "We can only regret about the breaking up of ties on the 
economic space of the former Soviet Union," he said. 
  Snegur believes that Moldova is unable to reject the Eastern 
market. 
  "We have had a try of following the agreements at 
Belovezhskaya Pushcha. As a result our economic indices have 
dropped very low," said Snegur. 
  He sees the way out of the situation in implemeting the 
agreement on the formation of an economic union within the 
framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States, which was 
signed by Moldova. 
  Snegur has denied speculation saying that Moldova intends to 
sign, within the CIS, agreements other than economic. 
  "We take part in integration on the issues that do not 
infringe our independence," he said. 
  Speaking about the relationships with Romania, he said: "We 
have one language, we are brothers and continue integrating 
economically and culturally, but we are building our independent 
states."

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 28/2/1994 -- The Council of 
Europe Observation Group is satisfied with the way in which 
elections in Moldovan Parliament were organized and held, 
declared the delegation chief Lambert Kelchtermaans at a 
press-conference today. Though some infringements were 
detected, they were unlikely to influence the results of first 
democratic elections based on pluripartisism. The delegation 
chief mentioned that the observation group visited over 40 
voting sections. According to the collected information 
analyzed by the Council of Europe delegation a final report will 
be presented to the Bureau of the Assembly of the 32. This 
report will be the basic element in the adherence of Moldova to 
the Council of Europe, which Council experts think will last for 
a longer period. Before the conference Parliament Speaker Petru 
Lucinschi assured the foreign observers that Moldova will cause 
no trouble to Europe" and wishes to join Europe with a 
democratic system and market economy.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 28/2/1994 -- Electoral 
observers from NATO and CSCE held today a press conference. The 
first pluripartite democratic elections in Moldova were run in 
"an atmosphere of normality and honesty" and according to the 
law on elections to parliament, stated from behalf of NATO 
delegation. The observers visited over 60 polling stations in 
various Moldova's regions; they noticed some technical and 
organization deficiencies, mainly caused by the lack of 
democratic experience in Moldova and this is not a reason to 
contest the results, says a press release issued by the 
observers. Lord Lucas said that about 12 percent of left bank 
population voted while other inhabitants of east Moldova had, 
though with difficulties, the real possibility to participate in 
elections. NATO and CSCE observers remarked as "a suggestion 
for future" the state's obligation to insure equal access to 
media for all political forces during the electoral campaign.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 28/2/1994 -- BASA has 
interviewed representatives of many political formations 
immediately after the first estimations of the voting have 
emerged. Valeriu Senic, leader of the Socialist Party of 
Moldova, declared "a normal thing happened, the voting expresses 
the population's will. First of all I consider these elections 
a general rehearsal for the future parliamentary elections, 
which will be run in an already unitary republic. Together with 
agrarians we shall constitute a based parliamentary majority, 
that will first of all solve the problems of the republic's 
south and east, adherence to CIS, and amendments to the law on 
languages. In a civilized state, the language is not taught 
with the cudgel, but with competent teachers, said the 
interviewed. 
  Gheorghe Ghimpu, leader of Democratic Party, told BASA: 
"Those who said long before that the elections will not be 
democratic were right. I think there have been infringements, 
frauds. A lesson of yesterday is that Russians have actively 
participated, while Moldovans were passive. The results of 
elections can only mean the following: The reaction won in 
Russia, the reaction also won here. Winners of the elections 
will federalize the republic, revise the laws on state language, 
Latin graphology, etc. We have to recognize that Moldovans 
neither know what is freedom nor want it." 
  Victor Popa, representative of the Reform Party, asserted 
"results of the elections show that the communist ideology is 
deeply infiltrated in our mentality. These results do not show 
at all the balance of forces in the society, but as always, any 
elections leave room for a triumph of paradoxes. Our electorate 
has voted the past instead of voting the future." 
  In the opinion of FPCD [Christian Democratic Popular Front] 
Alliance representative Sergiu Mocanu, "nothing grave happened: 
communists came back to power." Mocanu thinks the results of 
elections were influenced by the decree of Snegur on the 
participation of Dniester population and by the pressure of the 
executive which forced part of electors vote for agrarians. "We 
will try to contest the results of elections, both in localities 
inhabited by Gagaouzians and where Dniestrians voted, where 
numerous electoral frauds were detected." 
  PDAM [Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova] representative 
Dumitru Diacov stated to BASA "results of the elections display 
the ratio of forces in the society. We must all understand that 
electors realized well with whom to go. Despite of the 
arguments and the electoral noise." In Diacov's opinion, the 
mass voting for "Edinstvo" denotes a disorder in our political 
life. "Our Parliamentary majority will first of all solve the 
most urgent problems: the constitution, the Moldovan east and 
south and will prepare a package of documents to unleash 
reform," stressed the PDAM representative.

from the Parliamentary Press Service. Before February 27th, 
former MP's should have abandoned their ID's and diplomatic 
passports. Parliament commissions have formally finished their 
existence on the eve of elections, but most deputies engaged in 
commissions are still in offices in the parliament building, 
said Rotaru. He noted that the future MP's will enjoy the

Commission confirm their status and their mandates are validated 
during first sessions of the new parliament.

  [Text] Moscow February 28 TASS -- CIS peace-keeping forces 
will stay in Tajikistan until December 31, 1994, Viktor 
Samsonov, chief coordinator of CIS military cooperation, said. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Monday, Samsonov 
said that the troops will be reinforced by additional 
contingents of CIS states which are providing peace-keeping 
assistance to the republic under inter-state agreements. 
  The decision to this effect was adopted by the CIS defence 
ministers at their two-day meeting in Moscow last week. 
  Samsonov stressed that the decision on measures to stabilise 
the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border adopted by the defence 
ministers will be transformed into a law at the upcoming session 
of the CIS heads of state. 
  Under the existing agreements, Kyrgyzstan will reinforce its 
contingent in Tajikistan and Kazakhstan will send in a battalion 
in the near future. 
  If Afghan mujahideen and the Tajik opposition launch a 
large-scale offensive on the border in the spring or summer, 
"the available peace-keeping troops will not be enough to repel 
it," Samsonov said. 
  Asked about disagreements between the military delegations 
of 
CIS states, Samsonov said that the decision on the stabilisation 
of the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border was signed by all 
delegations, except Belarus.

<F P=106> ["Appeal by Ukraine's Supreme Council" issued in Kiev on 25 </F>
February 1994] 
  [Text] Esteemed Citizens of Ukraine: Ukraine is now going 
through difficult times. The economic crisis has not been 
overcome. The social problems have become extremely acute. In 
such conditions, when confidence in all branches of power has 
declined, Ukraine's Supreme Council, at the demand of the 
people, adopted correct decisions: to hold early elections. 
First, Supreme Council elections in March, and later, in June, 
Ukrainian presidential elections and elections to local power 
structures. 
  Therefore, Ukraine is at the threshold of new important 
changes in its political and economic life. We have a 
possibility to continue transformations in Ukraine in a peaceful 
way and do this in a manner adopted in the majority of 
democratic countries of Europe and the world: from elections to 
elections, to change the parliament and, therefore, also the 
government; in other words, to introduce changes into the ranks 
of those who will determine the state's internal and external 
policy. 
  However, in order for the peaceful revolutionary 
transformations in Ukraine to continue, elections to Ukraine's 
Supreme Council, appointed for 27 March 1994, must be successful. 
  However, certain facts and statements indicate that not 
everybody in Ukraine is interested in a successful course of 
these elections. There is talk of the possibility of some "power 
vacuum." Some people even openly advocate sabotaging the 
elections, undermining them. 
  If the Supreme Council elections do not take place, this 
will 
only further intensify the political and economic instability 
and will lead to a constitutional crisis in Ukraine. However, 
there will be no crisis of power, since the present Supreme 
Council will maintain its constitutional powers and will 
function until March 1995. However, why should we go backwards, 
if the change in Ukraine's Supreme Council may and must take 
place on 27 March 1994? 
  For precisely that reason, Ukraine's Supreme Council appeals 
to citizens and to all officials and power bodies who are 
involved in organizing the election campaign, with a request to 
show high responsibility at this time, which is important for 
Ukraine. Any actions or statements that may lead to the 
breakdown of elections or to their sabotage are inadmissible. 
Nor are any violations of the Law on Elections acceptable. 
  Ukraine's Supreme Council draws the attention of central, 
district, and local electoral commissions, the leadership of the 
State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, and the state 
mass media to the need to considerably improve activity aimed at 
intensifying the pre-election campaign and ensuring objectivity, 
the comprehensive nature of coverage, and the observance of the 
rights of candidates for deputies and voters. 
  Dear fellow citizens, let us use our chance to change the 
life of every one of us and of the entire society.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk believes that 
"today, atomic power plants can save Ukraine." He declared 
about this at a meeting with heads of the republic's atomic 
power plants on Monday. 
  The president reassured that the problem related to the 
supply of atomic plants with fuel would be solved in the near 
term, and in accordance with the tripartite statement between 
Ukraine, Russia, and United States signed in Moscow. Russia 
pledged to deliver fuel for atomic power plants in exchange for 
nuclear warheads. 
  In Kravchuk's words, currently, the government is solving 
issues to improve material conditions for the employees of 
atomic stations. In particular, the income tax for key experts 
of atomic power stations is to be lowered by 10%. 
  Kravchuk said that the proposal of atomic power stations' 
leaders to introduce world prices for power supply should be 
thoroughly examined. He said that "one should do this very 
accurately and in a balanced manner so as not to deepen the 
crisis phenomena in the economy and in the state." In 
Kravchuk's opinion, the issue of drawing foreign investments 
into atomic energy "is to be further analyzed and examined." 
  A presidential decree on urgent measures to develop the 
atomic energy complex is expected to be issued in the near 
future.

  [Text] Ukraine's nuclear power stations are under threat: 
At the microphone is Mayak's Kiev correspondent, Vladimir 
Sokolov: 
  [Sokolov] No, it is not radiation danger but financial 
danger 
that hangs over all 14 nuclear power sets of the Ukraine. The 
huge debt for nuclear fuel for them from Russia has practically 
halted its deliveries and reserves are being used up. At No. 1 
set of the South Ukrainian Nuclear Electric Power Station, for 
instance, its reserves are enough only till mid-May, and at a 
number of others for little more; and the Ukrainian press is 
already sounding the alarm about the destiny of the republic's 
nuclear power overall, even claiming that its nuclear power 
stations are dying. 
  Is the situation really so alarming? I asked this question 
of Nur Rashitovich Nihmatulin, the first deputy chairman of 
Ukrainian Goskomatom. He explained: 
  [Begin Nihmatulin recording] The situation in nuclear energy 
today is rather complex. We have worked fairly successfully in 
the autumn-winter season, producing up to 42 percent of the 
electricity throughout Ukraine. This is not because we raised 
the power at our atomic stations. It is because conventional 
power was forced to reduce generation of electricity owing to 
nondelivery of oil and gas. About 30 percent of the capacities 
were in reserve. 
  But we are feeling a terrible shortage of deliveries of 
nuclear fuel. To date, we have not paid for fuel for four sets, 
and if this situation continues we will be forced to take out of 
circulation about 4 million kWh of capacity. That is one set at 
the South Ukrainian, one set at the Zaporozhye, perhaps even a 
second set at Zaporozhye, and lower the load on the Chernobyl 
atomic power station. 
  Today, we consider that it is being resolved positively: 
There is compensation for the strategic weapons that will be 
sent off to enterprises in Russia, and on account of that 
strategic weaponry fuel is to be supplied for our reactors, and 
we hope that nuclear power will be alive and we will not have to 
take out of circulation a single set of a single station. [end

  During the meeting with officers and generals at the 
headquarters of Ukraine's Air Force, Vitaliy Radetskyy stressed 
that the merger of the Air Force and Air Defense has been 
suspended. It is necessary to work on this problem as a 
promising one. The defense minister presented the new Air Force

the post by a Ukrainian presidential edict. 
  "We are military people and must fulfill our supreme

the personnel. "Rally passions within troops are 
inadmissible...." 
  Radetskyy also met with officers of the command of the 43d

a missile and space power, and that even after the program for 
nuclear disarmament is completed, missile specialists will have 
to fulfill specific work for the defense of our country.

  [Text] On 19 February, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov met 
with leaders of officially registered parties. During their 
meeting, participants detailed their stances, the attitude 
toward the program of the president, changes in the Republic, 
and what assistance they require. The leaders of the parties, 
including the Party of Crimean Economic Revival and the 
Ukrainian parties, declared their readiness to promote the 
implementation of economic reform. 
  The meeting was held in a constructive atmosphere, stated 
Agrarian Party Deputy Chairman Mikhail Frolov. We favor social 
justice for workers of the agricultural sector, the issuing of 
additional benefits which are necessary for the development of 
the agricultural sector. In this respect, the stance of the 
president coincides with ours. 
  We came with a package of proposals, said Yefim Fiks, 
chairman of the Party of Social Guarantees, and the president 
suggested that edicts be drafted by us on the basis of our 
proposals. 
  Participants in the meeting spoke of the need to adopt a 
joint statement of all the political forces of the Republic in 
support of the president's actions. 
  When Sergey Nikulin, presidential adviser for relations with 
parties and public organizations, commented on this meeting, he 
noted that Yuriy Mechkov asked all the participants to forward 
proposals for candidates to vacancies in all state bodies. In 
the opinion of Nikulin, the consolidation will make it possible 
to create a powerful bloc supporting the course of the 
president. This will be a new kind of legislature, he stressed.

Ye. Saburov was very cautious in his statements and gave to

<F P=106> [Interview with Ye.F. Saburov, vice premier of the Republic </F>
of Crimea, by T. Ryabchikova; place and date not given: "'We 
Must Make Crimea Open to All'"] 
  [Text] Ye.F. Saburov, who has accepted President 
Yu.A. Meshkov's offer of the vice premiership of the Republic of 
Crimea, arrived in Crimea the day before yesterday. 
  Ye.F. Saburov is a candidate of economic sciences and 
full member of the Academy of Computerization and the Academy of 
Social Sciences of Russia. 
  Following graduation from the Mechanico-Mathematical 
Faculty of Moscow State University, he worked in a number of 
research institutes. From August 1990 through April 1991 he was 
deputy minister of education of Russia, from April through 
August 1991 he headed the group of economic advisers of the 
chairman of the Council of Ministers, after this he was deputy 
chairman of the Council of Ministers and minister of economics 
of Russia, and since January 1992 he has been director of the 
Government of the Russian Federation's Center for Information 
and Social Technology. 
  The day before yesterday, Ye.F. Saburov gave KRYMSKAYA 
PRAVDA his first interview. 
  [Ryabchikova] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, first of all, permit me 
to 
congratulate you on your arrival on native soil. You are truly a 
Crimean? 
  [Saburov] Yes, I am. I was born in Yalta in 1946, Crimea is 
my home. Following school graduation, I left Yalta for studies 
in Moscow. I graduated from Moscow State University, married, 
and stayed on in Moscow. But, naturally, I never lost my 
connection with Yalta, with the Crimea. My parents live here, my 
friends are here. And every year, whatever the weather, as they 
say, I have tried to get to Yalta. 
  [Ryabchikova] How will your citizenship problem, which 
greatly excites Ukraine for some reason or other, be decided now? 
  [Saburov] You can get excited over anything. I do not 
believe 
that there is such a person as Ukraine. This is, you know, 
something out of Ilf and Petrov--when the roadside philosophers 
sit on the embankment and argue: France wants such and such, 
Britain wants such and such. There are no such people as France, 
Britain, Ukraine. There are certain politicians in both Ukraine 
and Russia to whom confrontation for some personal ends of 
theirs is profitable. I do not believe that this question is so 
insurmountable that it cannot be settled by way of compromise in 
negotiations. 
  I am altogether a supporter of compromise and believe that 
compromise is very good, it is better than confrontation. After 
all, as Makarenko once said, if a Russian intellectual is a 
stickler for principle and sticks firmly to his positions, in 
half an hour the whole apartment is forced to take valerian. 
This is not necessary if a compromise is possible, if accord is 
possible. I believe that for Ukrainians and Russians the 
question of dual citizenship is simply a question of a normal 
life. Five million Ukrainians currently working in the Russian 
North are Ukraine also. 
  [Ryabchikova] And, then, you have come home. 
  [Saburov] Yes, this is truly the case. And it is altogether 
very strange to say that there is some Russian or Ukrainian 
economic science. 
  I would like to give you some facts. What is Russian 
economic 
science? It is Yevgeniy Grigoryevich Yasin from Odessa. It is 
Belkin from Kharkov. It is Grigoriy Alekseyevich Yavlinskiy from 
Lvov. It is ultimately myself--from Yalta. The policy of such 
countries as China, which are calling on their compatriots to 
help their homeland and asking them to return and work, would 
seem to me absolutely correct, therefore. It is strange to me 
that the Ukrainian state is not calling to such a brilliant 
economist as Yuriy Vasilyevich Yaremenko, a Ukrainian, he 
emphasizes this, but talking about a shortage of personnel here. 
  When Yu.A. Meshkov made me the offer and this become known, 
the telephone was ringing off the hook with calls from former 
Crimeans who live in Moscow and in Russia and who are doctors of 
economic sciences and very important specialists in particular 
sectors. They would very much like to come to Crimea and work 
for the good of their motherland. Does Crimea believe that these 
are not its sons? 
  [Ryabchikova] How will you embark on the fulfillment of your 
duties? Where will you begin? 
  [Saburov] I would like first of all to clearly determine 
what 
I can do and to remove all the exiting disagreements. I repeat: 
I am a supporter of compromise. This is not weakness but quite a 
strong position. And it means that I want to have freedom of 
action at the level I deem necessary. But for this I have to 
turn to the people of Crimea to learn my fellow countrymen's 
opinion. 
  First, people must understand that there will be no miracle. 
Any person who promises to make Crimea replete and prosperous in 
two days is a liar. The people must not be fooled. 
  I can promise only one thing--that I myself and the people 
whom I bring in will work as hard as they can for the good of 
Crimea. That we will try to do everything possible in this 
difficult situation with two inflating currencies and severed 
connections. 
  With the strange games of politicians, who do not know what 
they are doing. I promise to make every effort to overcome the 
obstacles, which there will be, of course. 
  I will take as the basis healthy business, primarily Crimean 
business, but with the attraction of businessmen of Ukraine, 
Russia, Turkey, France, whoever. I have already received certain 
offers. Very great interest has been expressed by Spain, for 
example. The Mediterranean countries are in principle longing to 
enter the Black Sea, and we must help them do so. 
  We must make Crimea open to all. Crimea never was and must 
not be an island fenced off from all countries. It must become a 
focal point of interests. 
  It is all this that will help create in Crimea prosperity 
and 
well-being and jobs and decent earnings, in a word, a normal life 
for society. 
  [Ryabchikova] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, could you name the 
members 
of the team you intend to bring from Moscow? And, further: How 
will you build your relations with the present Council of 
Ministers? 
  [Saburov] I believe that the enlistment of quite serious, 
efficient personnel would be not at all a bad thing for the 
structure of government of the Republic of Crimea. I have won 
the consent of certain people to live and work here, in Crimea. 
But I will decide later. I need first of all to familiarize 
myself with the present makeup of the government and to take a 
look at and scrutinize these people. 
  And, generally, I am not the sort of person who is inclined 
to go in for radical reshuffles for the sake of reshuffling. 
Each person who is currently part of the structure of government 
of the Republic of Crimea or its cities may count on my 
assistance, help, and the heartiest cooperation if he is really 
disposed to work for the good of Crimea. I will change people 
only if they are unwilling or unable to work or if they reject 
the proposals pertaining to a reform of the economy of Crimea 
which I intend to make. 
  [Ryabchikova] What will your first steps in reform of the 
economy of Crimea be? 
  [Saburov] There is a very varied structure of production in 
Crimea: industrial and agricultural and recreation zones and 
port installations. The speed of the solution of questions in 
these sectors will vary also, therefore. I understand what an 
onerous and difficult task this is, I understand that the 
economy of Crimea has been reduced to a condition which no 
longer fits within any economic notions even. This had to have 
been specially contrived. 
  But it is easy to fall into the abyss, climbing out of it is 
not that simple. I anticipate a program of Crimea's emergence 
from the economic crisis being drawn up in the coming months. It 
will be quite complex, evidently, and will require complex 
technical approaches. 
  This program will be presented for Crimeans' approval. To 
what end? 
  First, compiling an intelligent program is only half the 
battle, because it then needs to be fulfilled. 
  And, second, approval of a program in this way or the other 
imposes a responsibility on those who execute it. There is 
something for which people can be held to account. And in 
principle a person engaged in state administration (the 
executive) should be under supervision. For the executive, 
supervision means not trifling tutelage or immersion in 
paperwork but verification: whether the charted strategic 
program is being fulfilled or not. 
  [Ryabchikova] In consenting to become vice premier of Crimea 
you familiarized yourself, in all probability, with Yu.A. 
Meshkov's program and the promises he made to the people. Do you 
consider these feasible? 
  [Saburov] I would answer this question this way. For me 
personally it is perfectly clear that people voted for Meshkov 
inasmuch as he was, indeed, serious in formulating the question 
of an alliance with Russia, primarily of an end to the economic 
stupidities that have been perpetrated here. I believe that we 
need to tackle all economic matters on a purely professional 
basis, proceeding only from one consideration: whether things 
are better for people or worse. An alliance with Russia is 
extraordinarily important for Crimea. 
  The question of the ruble zone. Poly-currency conditions, 
where several currencies are in circulation simultaneously, 
would seem more attractive to me. Not necessarily the 
karbovanets and the ruble, what is more, there is the dollar and 
the mark and everything else. Any economic decision is 
ambivalent, everything needs to be computed: Is this 
advantageous or disadvantageous. 
  I fully understand Yuriy Aleksandrovich, who, of course, 
proceeded from the fact that being in the ruble zone is better 
than in the karbovanets zone. But for Crimea the question is now 
somewhat different: It needs to be understood what it is 
beneficial for us in Crimea to have as the special conditions. 
Everything needs to be looked at and computed here. 
  I would like to make separate mention of relations with 
Russia. Russia will sign an economic treaty with Crimea if it is 
duly substantiated, if it does not cause any international 
obstacles, and if it is beneficial to Russia itself. 
  We must proceed from the fact that no one will help us. Nor 
should they! We ourselves need to pull ourselves out of this 
difficult situation in which we have landed. 
  It is natural that Russia was and remains the most important 
and most profitable partner of Crimea, as of all of Ukraine 
also. That treaties with Russia are possible. And that it is 
perfectly possible to fulfill the necessary conditions about 
which I have spoken. It is perfectly possible to have direct 
relations with Russia. But why only with Russia? We will 
endeavor to ensure that each enterprise of Crimea might have 
direct relations with Russian enterprises and with Greek, 
French, or Swiss enterprises. It is all the same to us--just as 
long as life becomes somewhat better. 
  [Ryabchikova] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, what was your family's 
attitude toward the decision to move to Crimea? 
  [Saburov] What is my family? My mother lives in Crimea, 
although she is now in Moscow, it is true, since she has been 
indisposed. I brought her here because she could not live on her 
doctor's pension. Having worked, God knows, for so many years, 
she ultimately found herself destitute. But my mother is longing 
to return to Crimea, of course, as soon as it gets just a little 
warmer. My daughters are married, and they will, therefore, be 
going nowhere, most likely. And my wife was one of the main ones 
urging me to make this decision. 
  Truly, I very much want to do what I can here. I very much 
want to live and work for the good of Crimea and its 
inhabitants--my fellow countrymen.

<F P=106> [Interview with A.R. Franchuk, acting chairman of the </F>
Council of Ministers of Crimea, by V. Selivanova, KRYMSKAYA 
GAZETA correspondent; place and date not given: "Attention and 
Support Given"] 
  [Text] As has already been reported, a working group 
of the Government of Crimea was in Kiev from 15 to 19 February 
to examine implementation of the instructions of the president 
of Ukraine in accordance with the results of his meeting with 
the president of the Republic of Crimea. 
  Our correspondent asked A.R. Franchuk, the leader of 
this working group and acting chairman of the Council of 
Ministers of Crimea, about the outcome of the trip. 
  [Franchuk] I will begin with the fact that the conference 
and meeting in Kiev took place in a businesslike and friendly 
atmosphere and at a high level. We were received by Deputy 
Prime Minister of Ukraine V.N. Shmarov, who had invited to the 
meeting the ministers of power engineering and electrification, 
justice, agriculture, and machine-building, the deputy minister 
of the economy, the chairman of the State Property Fund, the 
first deputy chairmen of the board of the National Bank, and the 
managers of state committees and departments of Ukraine. Our 
working group also comprised ministers, chairmen of state 
committees, and directors of enterprises and associations. A 
number of questions that we had prepared for this meeting were 
discussed and resolved. 
  In accordance with the findings of our group, on 19 February 
Ye. L. Zvyahilskyy, acting prime minister of Ukraine, signed a 
protocol on the conference, conducted under his chairmanship, on 
issues regarding implementation of instructions on the results 
of the meeting of the president of Ukraine and the president of 
the Republic of Crimea. Its first point is the budget. The 
issue of implementation of the agreement on mutual budgetary 
relations between the Government of Ukraine and the Republic of 
Crimea for 1994 was decided positively by the minister of 
finance of Ukraine, and appropriate instructions were given 
concerning the procedure for mutual settlements. 
  [Selivanova] Anatoliy Romanovich, let us consider this 
question, please, in more detail. What advantages were gained 
in the formation of the budget? 
  [Franchuk] In the approval of the budget of Ukraine for 
1994, Crimea was left with an income in the amount of 43 percent 
of the sums received on its territory. The remaining 57 percent 
was subject to withdrawal for the state budget of Ukraine. 
Simultaneously, the allocation of subsidies from the state 
budget of Ukraine to Crimea was planned. It would have been 
very difficult to acquire them. Now, in line with the results 
of the trip, all taxes, collections, and mandatory payments 
received on the territory of the Republic of Crimea (except 
Sevastopol) will be entered into the Republic of Crimea budget. 
We, in turn, must pay back 4.3 percent from the budget to an 
account for general state programs of Ukraine (2.7 trillion 
karbovantsy). Now, above-plan income revenues will remain in 
Crimea. And additionally found incomes will not be confiscated 
for the budget of Ukraine. Hence, there is no longer a need to 
send money to Kiev and back to Crimea. And what I especially 
want to note is that an opportunity will present itself to 
balance the rural and settlement soviets more accurately. The 
conditions are created for ensuring the timely financing of 
budget expenditures. Thus, it is necessary to form a budget of 
Crimea on new principles and approve it at a session of the 
Supreme Soviet. The main task remains the receipt of a maximum 
sum of income. But for this, everyone has to work well. 
  It should be noted that the issue of allocation of resources 
to pay off last year's debt to Crimea was also resolved. 
  [Selivanova] How was the debt formed, and what does it 
amount to? 
  [Franchuk] The debt was formed as a consequence of an 
insufficient transfer of resources in 1993 to finance programs 
for the economic stabilization of Crimea and measures associated 
with the return of Crimean Tatars and other deported people. 
The sum is 110 billion karbovantsy, taking today's indexation 
into account. The Ministry of Finance of Ukraine is obligated to 
establish before 30 March the sources for paying off the debt 
and also to resolve the question of allocating $1.5 million for 
the payment of debts for the acquisition of imported equipment 
in the first half of the year for the Fiolent Plant. 
  I would also like to dwell on this very important question. 
The State Property Fund of Ukraine was instructed to prepare a 
draft decree of the Cabinet of Ministers by 1 March concerning 
the transfer to the property of the Republic of Crimea of 
facilities located on the territory of Crimea that are subject 
to privatization according to existing legislation of Ukraine. 
  [Selivanova] It is known that a number of enterprises in the 
Crimea need currency expenditures. How was this resolved? 
  [Franchuk] The Ministry of the Economy of Ukraine, on a 
representation of the Council of Ministers of the Crimea and 
pertinent ministries and departments, was ordered to prepare a 
proposal on the inclusion of our individual enterprises on the 
list of those that have a right to acquire hard currency 
resources. A period up to 30 March was set for an examination 
of the question on the priority sale of $4 million for the 
purchase of spare parts for imported trolleybuses, according to 
a request of the Council of Ministers of Crimea. 
  Questions concerning the allocation of additional capital 
investments for the completion of construction of the most 
important water supply and sewage facilities of the cities of 
our republic, Sevastopol's water supply, and also the allocation 
of additional quotas on capital investments and grants to 
finance the reconstruction and operation of land reclamation 
facilities and water management, and others were discussed. 
There was discussion of ensuring the uninterrupted work of 
departmental boiler houses of 
military health centers and rest homes. 
  [Selivanova] We are on the threshold of spring. What kind 
of support has been promised for Crimea's agriculture? 
  [Franchuk] Taking into account the difficult conditions of 
the past year and the volume of spring sowing work, our republic 
will be allocated 20,000 tonnes of gas and 30,000 tonnes of 
diesel fuel in February-May. The requirement for spare parts 
and imported agricultural equipment will be satisfied. Mineral 
fertilizers and spring crop seeds were provided. Other 
questions were also resolved. 
  The question of canceling the restrictions for the entry of 
citizens of Ukraine in Sevastopol was presented for examination. 
  [Selivanova] Is it possible to draw the conclusion that all 
the points entered in the conference protocol can realistically 
be implemented? 
  [Franchuk] Everything that is defined by the protocol and 
signed by Ye.L. Zvyahilskyy is realistic and has specific dates 
for completion in the first half of the year, starting in March. 
I had a conversation with President of Ukraine L.M. Kravchuk 
about the aims of the trip of our working group. And despite 
the difficult situation in Ukraine's economy, we were given 
attention and support by everyone we met at the very highest 
level. The ministries and departments of Ukraine jointly with 
the National Bank of Ukraine and the Council of Ministers of 
Crimea will have to continue work on implementation of the 
instructions of the president of Ukraine in accordance with the 
results of the meeting of the president of Ukraine and the 
president of the Republic of Crimea.

<F P=106> [Anatoliy Ladin report: "Russia and Kazakhstan Remain </F>
Partners. Nursultan Nazarbayev Defended Russia During His 
Recent Visit to America"] 
  [Text] Almaty -- At a news conference held in Almaty, 
Nursultan Nazarbayev returned several times to the subject of 
his personal attitude toward Kazakhstani-Russian ties. In his 
opinion, relations between the two states are developing 
normally at present, and no actions aimed at infringing Russian 
interests were undertaken during his visit to the United States. 
  The president of Kazakhstan confirmed that during his U.S. 
visit, many people asked about the situation in Russia. He 
tried to convince his partners in the talks that they should 
gamble not on the specific persons carrying out the economic 
reforms in Russia but on the actual process of democratic and 
economic transformations. He raised objections with those 
interlocutors in America who called the Chernomyrdin government 
conservative; according to Nazarbayev, he was able to 
demonstrate why he disagreed by using as a basis his own 
personal experience of relations with the Russian head of 
government. 
  The president illumined in detail the problem connected with 
the upcoming removal of the nuclear warheads of strategic 
missiles from Kazakhstani territory. 
  Kazakhstan is claiming 10 percent of the estimated value of 
all the uranium of the missiles which are on the territory of 
four CIS states and which are subject to reduction. 
  On the whole, Nursultan Nazarbayev advocated lending 
viability to the CIS states' economic union as quickly as 
possible. He said that Russia remains Kazakhstan's priority 
partner. At the same it must be taken into account that "it 
takes two to tango," the president emphasized figuratively. 
Therefore the desire for cooperation must be mutual.

  [Text] Yerevan, March 1 (SNARK)--During a period of last 6 
months Azerbaijani military aircraft more than ten times entered 
air space of Armenia and "layed eggs" in the border adjusting 
regions, the letter of Armenian Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan 
sent to Beniamino Andreata, an acting Chairman of the CSCE, and 
Manfred Woerner, NATO General Secretary. 
  Document also says that during a period of 1993 Azerbaijani 
aircraft did more than 50 military air-raids to the Republic of 
Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Mr. Papazyan attracts the attention of the CSCE and NATO 
leadership to the fact that Azerbaijan doesn't follow his 
obligations mentioned in the Treaty of Conventional Armaments in 
Europe. In particular, making a 1992-1993 annual report 
Azerbaijan deviated from supplying with the information on 
military airdromes where the military air-raids are undertaking 
from. A considerable lack of correspondence on the existence, 
reduction of the warplanes quantity and their losses is typical 
for the informational documents.

  [Text] Baku, March 1 (AZERTAC)--We still associate the 
possible resolution of the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh with 
the Minsk Group /CSCE/ and convinced that this organization is 
able to carry out its mission, though it has not been successful 
in its work, President Aliyev said at his todays meeting with 
Jan Eliasson, the chairman of Minsk conference of the CSCE. 
  The president pointed out that the Azerbaijani party 
considered that the conflict should not be settled by means of 
force because continuation of war would be meaningless. We 
stand for cease-fire and cessation of hostilities providing 
territorial integrity of Azerbaijan, inviolability of its 
borders and safety of its residents is guaranteed, President 
Aliyev said. 
  Mr. Jan Eliasson stressed that it was very important for all 
the parties concerned to comprehend that there is no alternative 
to peaceful resolution of the conflict. 
  Mr. Eliasson informed that he had had a round of talks in 
Moscow and Ankara, met with representatives of the 
countries-members of the Minsk Group, thus made great spade-work 
before he visited the region. Ceasefire - the first step on the 
road to peaceful resolution of the conflict was on the agenda of 
Russian talks. According to Mr. Jan Eliasson, proceeding from 
the Minsk Groups step by step method of peaceful resolution of 
the conflict the organization should know its following steps. 
These are withdrawal of Armenian army from occupied areas, 
restoration of communications, and a return of refugees to their 
homes. Both parties can hold negotiations on political 
settlement of the conflict after solving these problems. 
  Mr. Eliasson suggested to stop hostilities in occasion of 
renewal of the Minsk Groups efforts on peaceful resolution of 
the conflict. I hope we can achieve concord about cease-fire, he 
said. At the same time he expressed his comprehension that 
Azerbaijani party must be sure that the opposing party will not 
take advantage of lull and start a new offensive. 
  The chairman of the Minsk Group stressed that the CSCE is 
ready to help Azerbaijan to solve humanitarian problems raising 
as a result of the conflict and to mobilize strength of the 
world community to do that. 
  It is expected that Mr. Jan Eliasson will visit the zone of 
hostilities and the districts where refugees have being placed.

  During the past three days the police, armed with machine 
guns, as well as employees of the Procurator's Office of the 
republic, continued their searches of offices in the building, 
and checked people entering and exiting the building. 
  Today the journalists of "AZADLYG" and TURAN NEWS AGENCY 
held 
a joint press conference and provided details about the 
arbitrary lawlessness of the police to foreign diplomats and 
journalists. 
  Having found nothing in the rooms and basements of the 
building, the police and the employees of the Procurator's 
office were compelled to leave. Earlier they had said that 
"journalists hid weapons and ammunition in the rooms." But 
having found nothing, the policemen seized several issues of 
TURAN daily news reports and several issues of independent 
newspaper, CHESHME ("MOSAIC"). 
  Due to the lawlessness by the police, the employees of Turan 
news agency and the remaining organizations located in the 
building were unable to work for the entire day.

<F P=106> [Address to Supreme Council session by Head of State Eduard </F>
Shevardnadze in Tbilisi; broadcast in progress -- live] 
  [Excerpts] ... regulations which are of vital importance 
for Georgia. Batoni [Georgian polite form of address for males] 
Givi Lominadze started to enumerate them but then stopped. 
Kanbatoni [Georgian polite form of address of females] Manana 
mentioned the second clause. Please, listen carefully to my 
reiteration. I will remind you once again. Clause three: 
territorial integrity and the refusal to act in order to divide 
other country's territory is of vital importance. Refusal to 
use force against a member-state's political independence. 
Resolving the argument by peaceful means so that international 
peace and justice are not endangered. One more important 
regulation -- the supremacy of international law in inter-state 
relations, non-interference in each other's internal and foreign 
affairs. I would like to stress this phrase, as it was 
mentioned here that the CIS gives Russia free rein to interfere 
in the affairs of others. What may happen in actual fact is 
another matter, and maybe we have grounds for suspicion, but I 
am merely telling you what regulations and realities we are 
about to join and what we recognize and what we decline. 
  Guaranteeing human rights and basic freedoms in every aspect 
irrespective of race, ethnic origin, language, religion, and so 
on. This phrase may give rise to a certain doubt but it is the 
standard recognized by the whole world. [passage omitted] 
  The possibility of breaching the agreement which we are 
joining is another issue and in principle, probably, it is 
difficult to rule it out, but it is better if we joined this 
agreement, this document together with other countries with 
which we have many things in common, rather than stay out of it. 
[passage omitted] 
  Let me remind you of something. Of course, it is not a 
normal situation -- and I am speaking quite sincerely -- when a 
head of state takes such a decision without asking Parliament 
and the people. Some may say that I acted irresponsibly, while 
others may say that I usurped my authority. I would like to 
remind you in a couple of words when and why I took that 
decision. And I would appreciate your understanding. [passage 
omitted] 
  After the disaster and tragedy unfolded in Abkhazia and we 
lost Abkhazia and -- please, pay special attention to this and 
your understanding will be appreciated -- after Kobalia's units 
came to the approaches of Kutaisi and Tskhaltubo was almost 
captured and after civil war became inevitable, a civil war had 
already begun in Georgia. Let me remind you that I believed 
that we were almost doomed to a large-scale bloodbath. [passage 
omitted] 
  It was during those tragic days that I visited Moscow and 
asked them to protect the railways and our ports. You remember 
very well the days when they seized and sacked Poti and 
Samtredia. All links to Tbilisi and elsewhere were cut off. 
And the stock of flour and bread in Tbilisi was only enough for 
three or four days. It is hard to imagine a more difficult 
situation. 
  Therefore, at my request, the presidents of Armenia and 
Azerbaijan were invited to Moscow, together with me. The four 
[including Yeltsin] met there and came to the conclusion that a 
great tragedy might happen not only to Georgia but also the 
Transcaucasus. 
  An agreement in principle was reached to protect the 
arteries 
somehow. It was agreed that we would decide the rest ourselves. 
  It was indeed so dramatic and tragic personally for me and 
probably many of you as well in those days that I must have 
spoken 10 times with the Black Sea Admiral Baltin. I told him 
that if he thought my presence necessary I would fly to 
Sevastopol and meet the personnel. I told him that he had to 
help the [Georgian] authorities to regain Poti somehow, 
otherwise hunger and disaster would be inevitable or, 
alternatively, we had another option of giving up as the 
dialogue was impossible both with Gamsakhurdia supporters and 
the leader of the movement. I do not want to mar his name now. 
We were left with no other option and then I profusely thanked 
the man [Baltin] who took responsibility on his shoulders and 
sent several warships to Poti. It was then that the capital and 
the country were practically saved, if it can be called saving. 
Georgia has not yet been saved but the prerequisites for it to 
have been created. 
  In those days and under such conditions and taking into 
consideration all that had preceded it, I made this decision [to 
join the CIS]. Please, do not forget either that [changes 
thought]... there are witnesses, Baluashvili, deputy prosecutor 
general, must be present here. Witnesses have been 
interrogated. Chechen, Cossack, Abkhaz and mercenaries of other 
nationalities armed to the teeth entered Zugdidi. I personally 
visited those houses in Senaki and Khobi where they would spend 
the night, where people got shot. Let us go and ask the native 
population of that region. These are facts, it is a reality. 
Therefore, I may be tried, it may happen. I may be sentenced 
to death through shooting or hanging, but when one is sure that 
there is no other solution and that this solution may save the 
people and the country, then I think that one must not shirk the 
responsibility and I did not do so. You are free to condemn my 
behavior. Then I made a decision that Georgia had to join the 
CIS. [passage omitted] 
  Valeriy Kvaratskhelia voiced an interesting point. He said 
one sentence to which we did not pay appropriate attention. He 
asked if entry into the CIS means a certain limiting of those 
forces in Russia about which Yeltsin spoke in Tbilisi. Will it 
mean that they will be limited? Yeltsin said that there were 
forces in Russia, starting from Alaska and as far as the 
Ukraine, if I remember correctly, who are considering and 
dreaming of reinstating the empire. [passage omitted] 
  If certain forces in Russia come to power, they must know 
that there is another force, that there is the CIS. Russia then 
will have to leave the CIS. I repeat, it is not a guarantor but 
one of the factors. 
  He [Yeltsin] uttered several significant phrases which have 
to be reckoned with as well. We have mentioned one of these 
issues several times before. He put it like this: Russia 
remains responsible for the disruption of talks on the Abkhaz 
issue. It was a difficult thing to bring oneself to saying 
this, it was not easy. In principle, I agree with Tedo 
Paatashvili who said that whoever may be the leader of Russia, 
Georgia must try to maintain normal relations with Russia. It 
is a reality. History and God require so. Many things have to 
be taken into consideration in relations with a great country. 
[passage omitted] 
  What affect will it have on the visit to the United States 
if 
parliament ratifies this document today? I am grateful to those 
deputies who expressed their alarm that it may hinder us in 
achieving a certain success. I have a slightly different 
principle. I have always had different principles. We must 
pursue honest politics. I am not going to use the ratification 
of this document as, so to say, a trump card in a dialogue with 
the U.S. administration. We have different kind of relations 
with the United States. A lot has been said here that there are 
no activists in the West who view Georgia's joining the CIS as a 
positive event. It is not true. It is a well-known fact in the 
United States of America and other western countries that 
Georgia had no other option. What path could we follow? We 
must use this factor, we have a possibility for it, use the CIS 
and simultaneously cooperate with everybody. We have relevant 
guarantees that nobody is going to limit us in doing so, and 
nobody could. [passage omitted] 
  I would like to clarify something. Why did we not send two 
divisions to Sukhumi? It is a question of principle. We had 
the possibility to do so then. Not only because Gia 
[Karkarashvili] and Irakli [Batiashvili] said they would resign. 
No. I still believed; to be more accurate, I did not believe 
that we would betray each other in the battle for Sukhumi. I 
did not believe it. There were 8,000 men at the approaches to 
Sukhumi with equipment and every means. Some 4,000 more men 
were approaching from Ochamchire and were nearly at the 
approaches to Gulripshi rayon. Disaster happened. We betrayed 
each other and in principle, I could not imagine that betrayal 
of such degree and on such scale would be possible, but I do not 
want you to imagine that I am alleviating another country's 
blame for this. I believed and trusted that all of us were 
united then, both the former president's supporters, Kobalia, 
and others. I believed it and could not imagine that we could 
betray each other so. Therefore, I am stressing this fact for 
the sake of establishing the truth. 
  The rest must be thought out well. As Zurab Zhvania has 
said, what will happen if we do not join the CIS? It will be a 
long discussion. Let us look thoroughly at our present 
conditions and our future conditions. Therefore, the people, 
the nation, the country, and the state which are under these 
circumstances do not have the right to refuse even the slightest 
chance which is being given to us by nature and God in order to 
save ourselves. Please, listen with understanding to those 
arguments which I mentioned in my brief letter given to you and 
my speech. Thank you.

  [Text] According to a report from the secretary of staff to 
head of state, information from Head of State Eduard 
Shevardnadze concerning Georgia's joining the CIS was circulated 
today among the deputies of the Georgian parliament. The 
information says: The Georgian parliament must make a 
significant decision today on whether or not Georgia should join 
the CIS. The significance of this step is stipulated by the 
choice that our state is faced with today. Today each one of us 
must decide, as our conscience and intelligence prompts us, 
whether to follow the path of emotions, illusions and -- 
proceeding from this -- dashed hopes, or to make a serious 
analysis of reality and take a pragmatic attitude to our 
everyday issues. 
  The break-up of the Soviet empire on the one hand created 15 
independent states, but on the other hand, it created a new 
danger both for the development and existence of these countries 
and for the whole world. If events further developed according 
to this scenario, they would end with a complete catastrophe. 
This is what stimulated the search for the ways out of the 
grave situation and in my mind, the creation of the CIS was the 
result of this search. 
  In the beginning the CIS was not a structure that could 
effectively resolve the issues of Georgia and other countries, 
but, in the meantime, in the process of its self-determination, 
a whole range of significant issues were being worked out and 
mechanisms for comprehensive cooperation established. Georgia 
did participate in the work of different organizations of the 
CIS, but this was chiefly in the status of an observer, which 
limited our influence on the process of adopting a decision, and 
our national interests were not fully observed. 
  During this period, Georgia tried to regulate relations with 
other former Soviet republics. A fairly strong legislative 
basis for bilateral political and economic relations was being 
dynamically created. However, in the new circumstances and 
against the background of the processes of regional integration, 
this did not prove to be enough. The development of the 
processes within the CIS has once again proved the truth that 
securing political, military, and economic interests can only be 
carried out effectively if a bilateral cooperation is replaced 
by the mechanisms of comprehensive cooperation. 
  The CIS may not represent a definite guarantee for security, 
but it is one of the factors for legally securing our 
territorial integrity and the inviolability of our borders. 
  The regulations of the CIS also envisage the creation of 
mechanisms for the member-states' collective security, 
eradicating conflicts, and peacefully resolving disputes. 
  The realization of the CIS regulations will help restore 
broken economic links and develop them on a completely new basis 
which is a necessary prerequisite for the reforms for transition 
to a market economy. 
  Thus, becoming a member of the CIS will help our country to 
establish its place in the network of international and regional 
relations, to become a part of the mechanisms of comprehensive 
cooperation, and to use agreements on collective security and 
economic cooperation for reinforcing with law the country's 
territorial integrity, influencing the development of regional 
processes, and creating prerequisites for overcoming the 
economic crisis. 
  By becoming a CIS member, our country is proving its 
aspiration for civilized development of international relations 
and is getting additional means for improving the country's 
social and economic situation; it is becoming a fully-fledged 
member of the CIS with all relevant rights and, of course, 
responsibilities. 
  The CIS is in its initial stage of formation. The process of 
its formation is developing in quite a conflicting manner. 
Issues are seldom resolved without hot debates. Discussions 
are often uncompromising and severe. 
  Will the West react negatively to Georgia's joining the CIS? 
There are different points of view on this issue in Georgia's 
political circles. I have the following point of view: Many 
inter-governmental structures have been created since World War 
II. Most of them proved viable and many countries poorer than 
Georgia have found their way out from the crisis and poverty. 
The CIS must share this experience; there will be then less 
ground for doubts and we can show everybody what we can do. 
  The fact that we have already signed comprehensive 
agreements 
on friendship, cooperation, good-neighborliness, and mutual 
assistance with most of the CIS states gives us the hope that on 
the basis of work with natural allies we will be able to set up 
the CIS as a civilized and integrated union, and Georgia can 
make its honorable contribution in this respct. 
  I am sure that our active participation in the CIS will 
assist in overcoming the current crisis, promoting 
stabilization, and halting the decline in the population's 
standard of living. 
  [Signed] Eduard Shevardnadze

  Georgia's First Vice Foreign Minister Mikhail Ukleba says 
the UN Security Council must adopt a resolution on sending 
peacekeepers to the region if the next round of peace talks with 
Abkhazia due in New York on March 7 fails. 
  Speaking in Moscow on Tuesday, he said Georgian leader 
Eduard 
Shevardnadze, who would be visiting the U.S. at the time, might 
address a Security Council meeting on March 9. 
  Georgia is supportive of the idea of Russian troops being 
moved into the region and of giving them the status of 
peacekeepers, Ukleba told Interfax. At the same time, he spoke 
of UN fears that as a neighboring state, Russia may fail to stay 
neutral. 
  Ukleba expressed regret over the failure of the previous 
round in Geneva, blaming it on "the destructive position" taken 
by Abkhazia. 
  He said the warring sides were expected to sign two 
documents 
- a statement on measures for a negotiated settlement to the 
regional conflict and an agreement for the return of refugees 
and displaced persons to Abkhazia. 
  However, Abkhazia did not sign the statement because of 
being 
opposed to a clause on Georgia's territorial integrity, Ukleba 
said. And he added that the Abkhazians must opt out of the talks 
if they do not recognize Georgia's integrity as indicated by UN 
resolutions. 
  On the refugee issue, Ukleba said that as a pre-condition 
for 
signing an agreement, Abkhazia insisted on screening Georgian 
refugees to see whether or not they fought against Abkhazia. 
  Tbilisi puts the number of Georgians fleeing from Abkhazia 
at 
more than 300,000.

  [Text] Tbilisi March 2 TASS -- Georgia's new constitution 
provides for the building of a unitarian state with autonomies, 
a constitutional commission member told ITAR-TASS. He said the 
draft of the new constitution has been finalized, although some 
politicians in the republic have stated their preference for the 
federation idea. 
  But even federalists insist that the component parts of a 
Georgian Federation should not be granted the right of 
secession. They believe nonetheless that this would remove 
support for separatism and help the republic to get rid of 
conflicts on the ethnic grounds.

chairman of the Human Rights' Protection commission of the 
Georgian Parliament expressed his bewilderment on the recent 
declarations of Armenian leaders. 
  The other day Armenian Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan 
declared that Georgia will have nothing to do but to accept 
Armenian provisions. Earlier Armenia suggested to exchange some 
amount of gas, bought by her from Turkmenistan, with free 
shipment through Georgian territory. 
  "Such declarations won't promote our relations", Aleksandr 
Kavsadze told SNARK. In his opinion, "when the situation is 
difficult you should not to make such statements but to solve 
all the problems in consent. Moreover it is inadmissible to 
scare each other," said Georgian Deputy.

  [Text] On Sunday night [as heard], a pylon of a 110 kv 
high-tension power line between Broceni and Skrunda, 3 km from 
the Skrunda radar station, was blown up. An investigation into 
the incident is currently under way. The explosives used have 
not been identified yet. The Skrunda radar station is still 
receiving power via another power line from Tukums. Valdis 
Lidumnieks, head of the Broceni substation group of the 
high-tension power network, reports that the power supply via 
the damaged line will be resumed today. 
  The press center of the Northwestern Group of [Russian] 
Forces circulated a statement today saying that a joint 
commission of representatives of Latvenergo, the criminal 
police, and the Skrunda radar station assessed the explosion as 
an act of sabotage. A rapid reaction group from the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs, headed by Gunars Liepins, the senior 
investigator of the Latvian prosecutor's office for particularly 
serious (?cases), has left for the scene of the incident.

  [Excerpts] The explosion of a pylon on the electricity line 
supplying electric power to the Russian military site was 
sabotage. [passage omitted] Here is Ritums Rozenbergs reporting 
by phone from Moscow: 
  [Rozenbergs] Commenting on the blowing up of an electricity 
pylon of the Skrunda military site, (Sergey Grikhayko), head of 
the Baltic Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, stated 
the following: We hope that the Latvian authorities will adopt 
all necessary measures to clarify the causes and perpetrators of 
the incident, and we hope that this action will not affect the 
talks by our groups of experts and will not disturb the 
documents we have agreed on for the short term and the 
agreements signed on military questions. 
  It seems that the Russian side's reaction to the explosion 
of 
the pylon will not arouse broad debate. At the moment Russia 
has on its agenda questions of a much more serious scale. 
First, the spy trial has to be concluded; second, it has to go 
on settling the question of the Bosnian Serbs; third, the debate 
on the consequences of the amnesty has to be concluded. Ritums 
Rozenbergs, special correspondent for the newspaper LABRIT in 
Moscow, specially for Latvian Radio.

  [Text] An event that is possibly linked to the Skrunda 
incident: On Monday evening at the closed Russian military unit 
in the Estonian town of Paldiski a fire broke out. At the 
Russian military unit the barracks were burned. The fire was 
brought under control after about 90 minutes. The Paldiski 
police were not allowed into the scene of the fire. Russian 
Army officers expressed the view that this was deliberate arson, 
motivated by the fact that part of the military site has been 
pulled down. Possibly the fire broke out as the result of 
soldiers' negligence.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 01, BNS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's February 24 report at the Russian parliament was well 
thought over in contrast to the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozirev's frequent and inconsiderate statements, Aleksandrs 
Kirsteins, chairman of Latvian parliament foreign committee, 
said Monday [28 February] at the press conference in Saeima 
[parliament] house. Kirsteins noted that Yeltsin's report shows 
that it is impossible to forecast trends in Russian foreign and 
interior policy. 
  Kirsteins said that Latvia could agree to the Yeltsin's 
statement about the necessity to sign an agreement with Russia 
on minorities rights' protection so that it was possible to 
regulate the Russian minority's social status in Latvia. 
  Kirsteins thinks that placing matters related to Skrunda 
radar in the center of the interstate talks was just a political 
maneuver because, at the same time, Russia does not want to sign 
the agreement with Latvia and Russia's demands concerning 
Russian retired military personnel and its further stay in 
Latvia are unacceptable for Latvia. 
  In return, Faction Latvian Way leader Andrejs Pantelejevs 
noted that Russian presidents' report is an encouragement for 
Latvia to integrate sooner into Europe by passing a law on 
citizenship. Pantelejevs informed that the representatives of 
European Council will visit Latvia next week to discuss the 
possible Latvia's joining this organization.

  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- The State Duma has 
adopted a statement on a memorandum: 
<H3>  STATEMENT of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the 
Russian Federation Regarding the Adoption of the Memorandum on 
Accord and Decisions on the Amnesty </H3>
  On 23 February 1994, after discussing the legislative 
initiative of the Russian Federation president on the 
declaration of amnesty in connection with the adoption of the 
Russian Federation Constitution, the State Duma adopted a 
package of documents which are inseparably linked among 
themselves: "The Memorandum on accord;" the decision "On the 
declaration of amnesty in connection with the adoption of the 
Constitution of the Russian Federation;" "On the procedure for 
implementing the decision `On the declaration of amnesty in 
connection with the adoption of the Constitution of the Russian 
Federation;'" "On the declaration of political and economic 
amnesty;" and on recognition of the the decision of the State 
Duma "On confirmation of the membership of the commission to 
investigate the events from 21 September to 4 October 1993" of 
16 February 1994, which is no longer valid. 
  The adoption of these decisions has been dictated by the 
firm 
conviction that it is impossible to extricate Russia from the 
nationwide crisis without an amnesty for all those who 
participated in the well known events of 1991 and 1993, and it 
is impossible without stable civil peace. During discussion of 
the issue and through the joint efforts of the absolute majority 
of the State Duma deputies, a formula has been found for social 
reconciliation and for achieving nationwide accord. The basis 
of the formula is formed by a striving for constructive 
cooperation with the president of the Russian Federation, with 
the Government of the Russian Federation, and with all power 
structures and political forces, for the sake of consolidating 
society, and toward an understanding of the great responsibility 
for the revival of Russian statehood, and for the construction 
of a new Russia. 
  The Council of the State Duma Council believes that the 
decisions on amnesty offers thousands of Russians who have 
regained their freedom the chance to become actively involved in 
the creative work of all constructive social forces for the 
benefit of the Fatherland. However, if any of them lacks the 
common sense, the heart, or desire to take the road of accord, 
the State Duma, in conformity with the spirit and letter of the 
decisions adopted, will find an opportunity, jointly with the 
president of the Russian Federation, to take measures which do 
not allow the situation within society to be destabilized. The 
State Duma is prepared to examine constructive proposals for a 
mechanism to implement the resolutions stated, and also to 
examine a draft memorandum, agreed with other bodies of state 
power, on the responsibility of state institutions and 
politicians to preserve civil peace and public order in Russia.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at 
1317 GMT on 1 March carries a four and a half minute report on 
talks Russian President Boris Yeltsin held today with Federation 
Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko and State Duma Speaker Ivan 
Rybkin. The latter held a news conference afterwards. 
  The conference was brief and consisted largely of a 
statement 
that the recent State Duma amnesty decision reflected a spirit 
of conciliation between the authorities and various political 
forces. "If necessary, probably in the near future, the Duma 
will also examine a memorandum on the responsibility of state 
institutions and politicians for preserving civic calm in 
Russia," he said. 
  Regarding his meeting with Yeltsin, Rybkin said: "I won't 
hide the fact we spoke about the amnesty. And I drew the 
president's attention to the fact that some people are lifting 
the resolutions out of their context within the whole package of 
documents and giving a somewhat loose interpretation to parts of 
them. 
  "I drew his attention to the fact that in principle it was a 
memorandum of accord that was adopted above all else. And this 
was supported by an absolute majority of deputies. The 
memorandum of accord says that in the coming two or three months 
we should hold round-table talks to resolve many issues that are 
of vital importance to Russia: political, economic, nationalism, 
and social issues. And we should find a solution to many 
problems, especially as during the past weeks the approaches to 
this have been clearly defined by common effort. 
  "In the final analysis, all these agreements should lead to 
an accord of civic peace, national conciliation, and close 
cooperation between the authorities. 
  "The first young shoots of this cooperation and conciliation 
are there, but they need to be lovingly nurtured and 
strengthened. That's the first thing. Furthermore, we counted 
on the amnesty resolutions being implemented in full compliance 
with the procedure for conciliation, which was set out in detail 
in the package of resolutions. 
  "And if anyone thinks that the authorities acted 
inconsistently, perhaps a little hastily, then I say this: 
Close cooperation does not simply happen. It comes about from 
hard work day-in and day-out. 
  "These detailed stories about not being in time, hurrying 
with a letter, not getting an answer are, I think -- how shall I 
say this -- are just drawing the public's attention to goings-on 
in entourages. 
  "The processes of finding accord in Russia are indeed 
complex 
and difficult for us." 
  Rybkin also said at the news conference that he thought the 
conduct of the procuracy and Procurator General Kazannik's 
resignation somewhat hasty.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondents Pavel Kuznetsov </F>
and Ivan Novikov] 
  [Text] Moscow, 1 March -- The Council of the State Duma 
believes that the amnesty decision provides thousands of 
Russians who have newly acquired freedom to become actively 
involved in the creative work of all constructive public forces 
for the benefit of the country, stated Ivan Rybkin, who held a 
press conference in the State Duma today. 
  He read out a statement by the chamber's Council adopted 
yesterday. The statement says that if any of those amnestied 
"lacks the brains, common sense, heart, or desire to take the 
path of accord, the State Duma, in accordance with the spirit 
and letter of the decisions adopted and together with the 
president, will find an opportunity to take measures to prevent 
the situation in the country being destabilized." 
  Ivan Rybkin underlined that the State Duma is ready to study 
constructive proposals for a mechanism to implement the amnesty 
resolutions adopted by the Chamber, as well as to study a draft 
of a memorandum agreed with other bodies of state power about 
the responsibility of government institutions and politicians to 
preserve civil peace and public order in Russia. 
  The chairman of the State Duma said that the decisions on 
the 
amnesty were dictated by a strong conviction that Russia cannot 
be saved from a national crisis without an amnesty for all the 
participants of the notorious events in 1991 and 1993, just as 
it is impossible to achieve this without a stable civil peace. 
He underlined that during a debate of the amnesty question at a 
session of the chamber, the absolute majority of deputies 
jointly reached a formula for a achieving civil peace and 
national accord. It is based on a constructive cooperation with 
the president, all power structures, and political forces and is 
aimed at strengthening society and understanding the great 
responsibility for the rebirth of statehood and the creation of 
a new Russia.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 01, BNS -- Following is the official 
text of Estonian Foreign Ministry's statement from Monday [28 
February]: 
  In response to Russian Foreign Ministry official A. 
Udaltsov's announcement that Russia has backed away from the 
mutually agreed upon date for final withdrawal of Russian troops 
from Estonia, the Estonian Foreign Ministry expressed the hope 
that this was just one official's attempt to influence the 17th 
round of talks beginning today outside Tallinn. However, if 
Russia officially no longer accepts August 31, 1994 as the final 
date, Estonia may seriously have to consider breaking off the 
talks. 
  In interviews with Interfax and BNS February 28, Mr. 
Udaltsov 
also tied final withdrawal to "social guarantees" for military 
retirees and their families, directly contradicting previous 
Russian promises as well as CSCE and United Nations documents 
which specify and require unconditional withdrawal. The 
Udaltsov statements potentially negate the substantial progress 
made in the 16th round of talks held February 1-2 in Moscow. 
  Despite repeated promises, Russia still has not presented a 
withdrawal timetable as required by international practice. 
Nevertheless, Estonia made a concession in Moscow and accepted 
the August 31, 1994 date as proposed by the Russian side in the 
15th round of talks. 
  The Estonian delegation will do everything possible to 
ensure 
that the withdrawal agreement is initialed in the current round 
of talks. The Estonian side is also willing to discuss the 
question of social welfare for Russian military pensioners, but 
this does not mean that Estonia is prepared to tie that issue in 
any way to the withdrawal of troops.

  [Excerpts] Tallinn, Mar 01, BNS -- Alexandr Udaltsov, a 
senior official at the Russian Foreign Ministry in charge of 
Baltic affairs, today voiced his surprise at Estonian Foreign 
Ministry statement. 
  Udaltsov told BNS Estonia "is long since familiar with 
Russia's official position" on troop withdrawal, which does not 
accept Aug. 31 as the final, mutually agreed upon deadline for 
the pullout of its armed forces from Estonia. 
  "It is unclear why (Estonia) attempts to build this position 
up as a news item," the Russian diplomat said. "If the Estonian 
side is seeking a pretext to break off the talks, Estonians 
should admit they see no point in continuing the negotiations." 
[passage omitted] 
  Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar said at a press conference 
today that, if Russia officially announces it will change the 
troop withdrawal deadline, Estonia will break off the talks. 
  "The pullout of Russian troops from Estonia has slowed down 
since the beginning of the year," the premier noted. "If Russia 
had continued the withdrawal at the same pace as in past years, 
the troops would have left Estonia in the first months of this 
year."

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 01, BNS -- Vasiliy Svirin, head of the 
Russian negotiating team, today assured the Estonian team that 
press statements made by Russian Foreign Ministry official A. 
Udaltsov February 28 do not reflect official Russian government 
policy. 
  Despite continuing attempts by the Russian side to make 
withdrawal conditional and despite a spiraling Russian campaign 
of accusations and intimidation, the Estonian negotiating team 
described the withdrawal agreement as "practically ready" going 
into the current round of talks being held March 1-2 outside 
Tallinn. The final date for full withdrawal, August 31, 1994, 
was agreed upon at the 16th round. The Russians still have not 
presented a timetable, however. 
  The slow-down in both the withdrawal of troops and the 
turn-over of military installations to Estonian authorities 
began in October 1993 and has continued to date. Although the 
number of Russian troops stationed in Estonia is now about 
2,600, hundreds of military sites, bases, training fields, 
depots, airfields, housing units and intelligence and 
communications centers remain under Russian control. These are 
mostly located in the capital city of Tallinn and in surrounding 
Harju County. About 70 of these are of particular concern to 
Estonia due to their size, strategic importance or the presence 
of hazardous materials. 
  Important Russian military storage facilities include 
Maenniku and Klooga ammunition dumps (3500 tons), the 2748th 
Mine Storage Facility, the 2753rd Mortar Shell Base (7500 tons 
of ammunition and explosives), the 690th Chemical Storage (300 
tons), the 2577th Technical Storage, the 2754th Mine and Torpedo 
Base, the 2394th Mine and Torpedo Storage, and the 3063rd Fuel 
Storage (above ground tanks plus underground storage 400 meters 
long). High levels of radioactivity detected at the Chemical 
Storage has caused further delays there. On the positive side, 
according to the Russians, the number of mines stored on 
Naissaar has been reduced to 450, all scheduled to have been 
burned by April 1. 
  The Russian armed forces are primarily stationed at the 
Tallinn Naval Base, the 144th Motorized Division, the 93rd Naval 
Training Center with two nuclear reactors in Paldiski, the 
Russian Navy's Radio Intelligence Unit, and the Naval Auxiliary 
Control Center. 
  According to Russian negotiators, nearly 6,000 of the 
pensioned Russian military in Estonia are men under the age of 
sixty. Over 1,000 of these are under the age of fifty, with 
fully 360 younger than 45 years of age. In addition, there may 
be as many as 5,000 officers who have left or are leaving the 
Russian military without qualifying for pensions. There is no 
way for Estonian authorities to record or check such 
individuals. According to the Estonian Security Police Board, 
the continuing presence of former Soviet occupation troops in 
Estonia increases political tensions, destabilizes society, and 
directly increases crime.

  [Text] The Estonian-Russian negotiations continued in 
Lohusalu yesterday. The plenary session was followed by the 
discussions of different work groups. Another plenary session 
is to take place today. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry announced the replacement of 
six 
delegation members. The new members include the head of 
administration of the Leningrad region Alexander Belyakov, 
deputy head of administration of the Pskov region Viktor 
Zvonkov, deputy head of the Russian Federal Migration Service 
Yuri Roshtchin and department head of the Russian Ministry of 
Nationalities and Ethnic Policy Lev Shishov. The latter used to 
be a high-ranking official of the Estonian Communist Party in 
the Soviet period. 
  Head of the Russian delegation Vasily Svirin expressed his 
hopes of making progress in the key issues -- the situation of 
the Russian-speaking residents and the troops withdrawal. 
Svirin assured that the withdrawal deadline, August 31, is 
definite, provided Estonia will finance the construction of 
apartments and will agree with Russia to give up demands for 
compensation for the military bases and the ecological damage 
caused by the military. But he added that "Estonia does not 
meet those three requirements at present and the final troop 
withdrawal deadline will be agreed upon only after the signing 
of the corresponding agreements." 
  The Foreign Ministry announced that the Estonian-Russian 
negotiations may be suspended if the claims of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry official Alexander Udaltsov will become an 
official government position. Estonia is willing to discuss all 
issues including the one on the military pensioners, but will 
not link them to the troops withdrawal, the Foreign Ministry 
stressed. 
  Prime Minister Mart Laar described the Russian statements as 
an attempt to influence Estonia and present new demands. Laar 
added that the negotiations are practically at a deadlock and 
pointed out that Russia has stopped the withdrawal of its troops 
from January 1. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry official Udaltsov expressed his 
surprise at the Estonian Foreign Ministry statement and claimed 
that the Estonian side had been long aware that August 31 was 
not an officially agreed-upon deadline.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 01, BNS -- A Russian diplomat in 
Lithuania denied as "not corresponding to reality" reports by 
the Russian PRAVDA newspaper that the Lithuanian prosecutor's 
office planned a provocation against the so called Association 
of Russian Citizens in Lithuania. 
  In its Jan. 18 issue, PRAVDA, the newspaper of the Russian 
communists, said the provocation failed thanks to "the firm 
position of a Russian Embassy representative." 
  PRAVDA said the provocation started with the interrogation 
of 
Valentin Meshcheriakov, leader of the association, which is "the 
last legal organization that openly defends the interests of our 
fellow-countrymen in that republic." 
  Meshcheriakov was interrogated in the presence of Nikolay 
Sokolov, counselor of the Russian Embassy in Vilnius. The 
Russian diplomat said he disagrees with the definition "firm 
position." Sokolov said he did not get the impression that this 
was a provocation against the association or its members. 
  The Lithuanian Prosecutor General's Office confirmed that 
Meshcheriakov was interrogated Feb. 14, but only as a witness in 
relation to the failed 1991 Soviet coup attempt in Lithuania, 
and not as a person suspected of "sabotage." 
  In a communique presented to the Russian Embassy in 
Lithuania, the prosecutor's office said a Russian diplomat was 
allowed to be present during the interrogation, although the 
Lithuanian Procedural Code does not provide for such a 
possibility. This was done to avoid any biassed evaluations of 
the act, the communique said. 
  The prosecutor's office said Meshcheriakov confirmed that 
his 
association is not officially registered in Lithuania. The 
Lithuanian Prosecutor General's Office also categorically denied 
allegations of sanctioning an arrest of 25 association members.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 01, BNS -- It would be a complete 
disaster to Lithuania if the Russian Lucoil company would refuse 
to supply oil to the Mazeikiai oil refinery, said Lithuanian 
Energy Minister Algimantas Stasiukynas. 
  In an interview with the LIETUVOS RYTAS newspaper, 
Stasiukynas said the Lithuanian refinery gets many suggestions 
to buy Russian oil but does not have enough money. The minister 
said Mazeikiai will nevertheless purchase some oil from 
companies which can wait for payment. 
  Stasiukynas commented on the suspension of an oil export 
license issued to Lucoil. A decision to suspend the license was 
made by the Russian International Economic Relations Ministry 
Feb. 16 "to clear up the circumstances of oil trade." Lucoil is 
blamed for cooperation with the Baltic states, LIETUVOS RYTAS 
said with reference to a high-ranking Russian energy official. 
  Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas was unable to 
comment on the fact during a press conference Monday [28 
February]. Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius said he does not 
have any information about the temporary ban. 
  Dzhevan Chalakhayants, Lucoil vice president, told the 
newspaper that "there were problems related to oil supplies to 
Mazeikiai," but, in his words, the company will be allowed to 
export oil again in March. Commenting on cooperation with the 
Lithuanian refinery, he said Lucoil never promised to supply oil 
to Lithuania but only refines it in Mazeikiai. 
  Bronislovas Vainora, Mazeikiai director general, said the 
ban 
will not affect the refinery because the oil supplied by Lucoil 
is not regarded as export. He said Mazeikiai only refines oil 
and gets 20 percent of the ready production for work. 
  Vainora noted that the refinery did not violate any 
agreements with Lucoil. In his view, Russian officials simply 
decided to check whether cooperation between Lucoil and 
Lithuania is efficient and whether production returns to Russia. 
This is not the first time that Lucoil's rivals initiate such a 
check-up, Vainora said. 
  According to a contract between Mazeikiai and Lucoil, the 
Russian company will refine 6 million tons of oil in Lithuania 
by 1997. 
  Mazeikiai refined 3 million tons of oil last year and will 
presumably refine as much as 6 million tons from different 
sources this year.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 01, BNS -- The most recent public 
opinion poll in Lithuania indicates that President Algirdas 
Brazauskas continues to top the list of most popular politicians 
after a year spent in office. 
  The principal tendency remains the same -- political leaders 
are gradually losing popularity. Aloyzas Sakalas, leader of the 
Social Democratic Party, was the only exception during the 
period between mid-January and mid-February. 
  The results of the poll conducted by the British-Lithuanian 
Baltic Surveys company suggest the following list of top ten 
Lithuanian politicians: 
  Algirdas Brazauskas -- 56 percent /-2/ 
  Egidijus Bickauskas -- 50 percent /-3/ 
  Romualdas Ozolas -- 46 percent /-1/ 
  Kazimieras Antanavicius -- 41 percent /0/ 
  Vytautas Landsbergis -- 35 percent /-5/ 
  Adolfas Slezevicius -- 33 percent /-4/ 
  Gediminas Vagnorius -- 28 percent /0/ 
  Aloyzas Sakalas -- 28 percent /+1/ 
  Ceslovas Jursenas -- 27 percent /-1/ 
  Povilas Gylys -- 18 percent /0/

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] A full stop has finally been put to the trial of the 
State Committee for the State of Emergency [SCSE], which has 
been dragging on for several years without result. 
  [Correspondent A. Pishchayev] The procedure for sealing the 
fate of the coup plotters took no more than three hours today. 
But this quick verdict did not serve to change the minds of 
those participating in the trial. As before, the defendants 
continued to maintain that they were not guilty of high treason. 
  On the subject of amnesty, they gave their full support, as 
this is in the name of so-called national reconciliation. 
  Pichenkin, Yazov's lawyer, said the Duma resolution reflects 
the will of the people, no more, no less. He called for this 
will to be carried through. 
  All the defendants called on the court to issue a resolution 
closing the SCSE case. 
  Defendant Varennikov said: All is apparently quite clear and 
simple, but I cannot understand who is giving me amnesty and for 
what. I can do the forgiving -- of Gorbachev, of Valentin 
Stepankov, of Nishanov, of Trubin, for unlawful actions. He 
announced his petition requesting that criminal proceedings be 
started over the break-up of the Soviet Union. 
  Defendant Shenin said he saw no point in proving his 
innocence to a regime which has violated the law. I believe 
that Soviet power will return and sort everyone out, Shenin 
asserted. 
  The defendants and their lawyers said that throughout the 
whole SCSE trial the court came under pressure from the powers 
that be. Lawyer Ivanov accused Yeltsin's adviser Baturin of 
putting pressure on the former general procurator Kazannik, 
which warrants criminal proceedings, he said. 
  After a hearing of the state prosecution which insisted on 
continuing the case, the military tribunal decided to end the 
SCSE trial on the basis of the amnesty resolution. 
  So, the case is closed and at the flick of the Duma's 
finger, 
1 March can now be regarded a day of reconciliation and justice.

  [Text] The investigation into the criminal case instituted 
with regard to the organization of mass unrest on 3-4 October 
1993 in the capital is continuing. This is set out in the 
statement from the information and public relations center of 
Russia's General Procuracy. It is noted in the report that the 
investigation has not yet been completed of the circumstances 
regarding the infliction of material damage, which, according to 
the legislation, is subject to compensation by those who are 
guilty of it. The investigation also needs to be completed 
regarding individuals who took advantage of the situation that 
had taken shape in Moscow from 21 September to 4 October 1933 
and committed thefts, acts of violence, deliberate hooliganism, 
and other breaches of the law. 
  The general procuracy stressed that if those amnestied take 
the path of unlawful action again, it will use all the powers 
granted to it by the law that has come into force where there 
are conditions of unavoidable liability.

Aleksandr Rutskoy, proclaimed Russia's president last autumn by 
Ruslan Khasbulatov's parliament already proclaimed dismissed by 
Yeltsin, said a couple of days after his release from jail last 
week that he accepts the legitimacy of the legislature Yeltsin 
created in the former parliament's place. This new legislature 
ruled on an amnesty which freed Rutskoy, Khasbulatov and other 
organisers of armed resistance to Yeltsin's move to crush the 
old Soviet-era parliament last October. 
  Rutskoy called for a spirit of reconciliation in Russia in a 
statement faxed to Russian and foreign news agencies on 
Wednesday. In the same statement he defended the armed 
resistance to Yeltsin's move last autumn.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Gurevich report: "Don't Believe Anyone But </F>
President's Press Service and President Himself"] 
  [Text] The persistent speculation in the press about 
Yeltsin's television appearance still remains only speculation. 
It was not planned either for 28 February or 1 March (this 
information was available to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS from the 
president's press service as this issue was going to print). 
The rumor about the appearance must have been raised by 
journalists' speculation which presidential aides Baturin and 
Satarov did not wish to deny, stating that it was "not far from 
the truth." In principle, the above aides could have said 
nothing at all because, as Yeltsin's press service officers 
stated to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, all official communiques about 
Yeltsin's addresses are supposed to come from it. Well, and -- 
certainly -- from the president himself.

<F P=106> [Ivan Rodin report in the "Parliament" column: "Has Time in </F>
the Kremlin Stopped? The Presidential Team Is Unhappy That the 
October Prisoners Were Released at the Onset of Spring"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Apparently the president, who 
Monday evening was planing to speak on TV, promulgating a 
certain edict, mothballed himself and some of his aides in the 
October environment. According to some reports, the proposed 
edict did not contain any specific tough measures, but its very 
tone was fairly menacing. According to one account, it was the 
unspecific and menacing verbiage of the edict that disappointed 
the president and resulted in cancellation of his TV appearance. 
  There is also another version. Boris Yeltsin's readiness to 
make a speech and the draft edict were used to bring pressure to 
bear on the Duma chairman and consequently on its deputies in 
the course of his evening meeting with Filatov, Satarov, 
Ilyushenko, and Yakovlev. Rybkin, however, apparently managed 
to propose to his guests a certain option, even if not very 
radical, to defuse the situation: that all power bodies, 
politicians, and political movements sign a joint memorandum on 
responsibility for the breach of civic peace in the country. 
Such a document was to be prepared by a working group including 
representatives of the Duma, the Prosecutor's Office, and the 
president. So far it is not known which credible guarantees 
that the Duma will assume part of its responsibility, including 
for the political conduct of the amnestied, that Ivan Rybkin 
managed to provide to the president's "right- and left-hand 
men." The fact that some guarantees were given, however, is 
confirmed indirectly by the words by a Duma apparatus officer 
who stated that the guests "came with one opinion but left with 
quite another." 
  Yet there is no certainty whatsoever that the lower chamber 
will want to vote for a memorandum on responsibility. First, 
this is not so essential now that the objective -- freeing the 
"Lefortovo inmates" -- has been accomplished. Second, to assume 
political responsibility for the actions, say, of Aleksandr 
Rutskoy is absolutely not in the interests of the communists or 
their allies, who are suspicious of the former vice president. 
Finally, even if the Duma does vote to assume responsibility -- 
within its jurisdiction of course -- for observance of civic 
peace in Russia, this still leaves the president, whose 
commitment to any memoranda cannot be guaranteed in any way. 
The greater part of the Duma deputies understands this very 
well and therefore one should expect prolonged debates on the 
expediency of adopting any document imposing on it any greater 
responsibility than stipulated by the constitution. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> ["NG" report under the "In Brief" rubric: "Prosecutor's </F>
Office Bewildered"] 
  [Text] It has come to light that many among the 
prosecution staff are bewildered by the decision to appoint 
Aleksey Ilyushenko, former head of the Control Administration of 
the Russian Federation president's staff, as acting general 
prosecutor of the Russian Federation. Ilyushenko actively 
worked for the Interdepartmental Commission on Combating Crime 
and Corruption which was gathering damning evidence against some 
prominent figures of the Russian opposition, in particular 
against Aleksandr Rutskoy. A check on the information gathered 
by the Interdepartmental Commission was entrusted to the Moscow 
Prosecutor's Office. Some time later, it concluded that the 
charges of financial machinations against the former Russian 
vice president were unsupportable. Following this, a decision 
was made to institute a criminal libel suit. Theoretically, 
those to be tried were former members of the above 
Interdepartmental Commission, including Mr. Ilyushenko. One 
high-ranking Moscow Prosecutor's Office staffer has promised to 
speak to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on this score in greater detail.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kholodov report: "People Do Not Sit Very Long in </F>
Lubyanka. Will Sergey Stepashin Occupy the `Rickety' Chair?"] 
  [Text] General Golushko's resignation has long been awaited 
-- ever since the reorganization of the Security Ministry and 
even earlier -- immediately after the 3-4 October events when 
the security bodies were charged with passivity. Still the 
action came as a surprise. 
  The firing of the recently appointed Federal 
Counterintelligence Service director can hardly be linked to the 
arrest of the Ames couple in the United States. They worked for 
the Foreign Intelligence Service. (In response to a request to 
comment on the arrest of a Russian agent in the United States, 
Viktor Zorin, chief of the Federal Counterintelligence Service's 
Counterintelligence Operations Department, advised that we turn 
to the Foreign Intelligence Service). 
  It is most likely that Golushko's resignation is closely 
related to [General Prosecutor] Kazannik's resignation. 
Noteworthy in this respect is a memorandum by presidential 
security adviser Yuriy Baturin pointing out that the Duma has 
issued an act of pardon and not of amnesty, thereby intruding 
into the president's jurisdiction. This memorandum carried an 
endorsement by Yeltsin himself to Kazannik, Yerin, and Golushko 
to act in accordance with instructions. Yerin and Golushko are 
directly concerned with the "instructions:" Lefortovo is a 
Security Ministry prison and it is now in the process of being 
transferred to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
  It is being suggested that Golushko refused to prevent the 
release of the inmates. At an emergency conference on 25 
February with Yeltsin, attended by Kazannik, Ilyushenko, Yerin, 
and Baturin, the Federal Counterintelligence Service chief was 
not present. Apparently dark clouds were already beginning to 
loom over him. According to some reports, prior to signing the 
edict on Golushko's resignation, Yeltsin had a talk with him 
whereupon the rapid "resignation with no comment" followed. The 
edict does not even indicate the reason for Nikolay Golushko's 
departure: It was not until a little later that "family 
circumstances" were brought up as a reason.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ruslan Khasbulatov by Vitaliy Shestopalov on </F>
27 February, place not specified: "Ruslan Khasbulatov: There 
Is No Torture Worse Than Lies"] 
  [Text] Ruslan Khasbulatov, former chairman of the Russian 
Supreme Soviet, met with your SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA correspondent 
on Sunday and gave him an interview specially for our newspaper. 
  [Shestopalov] Ruslan Khasbulatov, readers of SOVETSKAYA 
ROSSIYA congratulate you on your return home. 
  [Khasbulatov] Thank you! 
  [Shestopalov] How did you spend your first day? 
  [Khasbulatov] The first thing that I did was familiarize 
myself with the place again and I hope this will not seem 
strange but I was sort of trying to get used to it... 
  [Shestopalov note] The telephone did not stop ringing in the 
apartment with people offering congratulations. Khasbulatov 
began receiving his first telegrams in Lefortovo on 23 February. 
  [Shestopalov] Was there nothing from President Dudayev of 
Chechnya? You are fellow countrymen after all! 
  [Khasbulatov] There was nothing from Dudayev (Khasbulatov 
smiles). To the best of my knowledge he helped the present 
regime in the struggle against the parliament. It is rumored 
that apart from large sums of money he intended to send a 
detachment of volunteers to Moscow to help the OMON special 
purpose militia and "Beytar." But the volunteers did not come, 
of course.... Otherwise they would have gone over to our side. 
  [Shestopalov] Were you able to read SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA in 
Lefortovo? 
  [Khasbulatov] I asked for it as soon as the authorities 
"liberated" the newspaper. I felt a need for objective 
information. 
  You know what is the strangest thing to have to endure in 
jail?.. The "Mayak" radio station and radio "Rossiya." From 
morning till night you get nothing but streams of primitive 
lies. It is amazing where they get so much nonsense from, what 
kind of think tank they must have to produce those lies every 
hour? Lies are the most terrible form of torture! 
  Primitive propaganda is based on elementary human 
forgetfulness. Take, for example, the Bosnian problem, which 
Yeltsin's press presents to us as an "outstanding diplomatic 
triumph." But where were Messrs. Kozyrev and Yeltsin 18 months 
ago? Remember how many sessions of the Supreme Soviet were 
dedicated to this most important question of Russian foreign 
policy. What didn't they accuse the Supreme Soviet of then -- 
pan-Slavism and flirting with the patriots! 
  They have no other way out today! Can air strikes against 
Serbia, NATO maneuvers, and blind support for U.S. initiatives 
really bring the regime success? That is why they were forced 
to adopt the option once proposed by the Supreme Soviet.... 
  There is much to be amazed at.... 
  I closely studied Yeltsin's message to the Federal Assembly 
and the State Duma. I was very surprised! The message is 90 
percent made up of things that I said at congresses of people's 
deputies beginning with the sixth congress. Thus the 
president's team, which prepared this material, has accepted the 
Supreme Soviet's assessments. There is something else that 
amazes me, too! These people are incapable of performing the 
present task because they are bent on the destruction of Russia 
and on waging war against their own people. Yeltsin's team has 
more interpreters in it than professionals... 
  [Shestopalov] In your view, what mistakes did the Supreme 
Soviet leadership make in the tragic weeks of September-October? 
  [Khasbulatov] That is hardly the way to put the question. 
The constitution which Yeltsin so fiercely rejected was a whole 
magnitude better and more democratic than his brainchild. I do 
not know how the present "creation" is legitimate. What is its 
basis? The will of the people? I doubt it very much! It was 
thrown at the people without discussion. And then they began 
insinuating: if you do not accept it there will be civil war! 
You can hardly suspect MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS of antipathy 
toward Yeltsin although even that newspaper wrote about 
"trickery" when the votes were counted. 
  Remember, the president carried out a coup d'etat. What 
should the Supreme Soviet do? It should act in full accordance 
with the existing Constitution! Which is what the leadership 
did! We proceeded first and foremost from that very 
Constitution on which Yeltsin himself took the oath. We 
proceeded in particular from Article 121 of Point 10 ratified by 
Yeltsin when he was chairman of the Supreme Soviet. 
  I was blamed for calling the Armed Forces into action. In 
accordance with the law on defense, the Armed Forces are 
subordinate to "the Supreme Soviet of Russia, the President of 
Russia" under Article 10. Note that the word "president" here 
comes second. Something else is enshrined in the 
Constitution... The Armed Forces are the guarantor of the 
Constitution, hence the call for their protection. After all, 
the appeal was not to use their tanks to fire on the Russian 
parliament but to protect it!.. We acted in full accordance with 
the law. We managed to convene a Congress of People's Deputies 
which retained the full range of power. 
  [Shestopalov] How justified was the appointment of the new 
power ministers? 
  [Khasbulatov] I make no secret of the fact that there was a 
different viewpoint in existence. I wanted to create a kind of 
Military Council using old and new ministers. But the figures 
of Yerin and Grachev did not have sufficient standing. In 
addition, there was the crisis situation in the Security 
Ministry at that time. There were lots of persistent voices 
calling for the replacement of the ministers. There were also 
those demanding the replacement of the government in its 
entirety. 
  But it cannot be said that we acted correctly all the time! 
The extreme situation caused mistakes. I must mention one 
fact. The leaders of many of the major plants, using the threat 
of dismissal, banned thousands of workers from coming to the aid 
of those who were defending people's power at the House of the 
Soviets. Historians will have the task of examining all this 
honestly. 
  [Shestopalov] What are your plans for the immediate future! 
  [Khasbulatov] I am not afraid of the courts! But I do not 
intend going back into politics. I do not see any worthy 
individuals to cooperate with. I shall work at science, I shall 
write a book. That will mean getting involved in dozens of 
problems... Jail is jail. The radio station "Mayak" alone is 
enough to "beat" your brains out (he laughs). 
  Khasbulatov lit a pipe. 
  [Shestopalov] Ruslan Imranovich, where is the pipe which, it 
is rumored, Boris Nikolayevich broke in a rage? 
  [Khasbulatov] I do not know which pipe he broke. I still 
have mine with me. 
  As I was leaving I asked him the fundamental question -- to 
whom will history give the final word? 
  [Khasbulatov] Not Yeltsin... That is for sure. He is 
doomed. It is he who will have to answer for Grachev for the 
tanks, for Yerin for the OMON, and for Luzhkov for the 
Beytarovtsy. Their judgment day is still to come.

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Anpilov by Valentina Nikiforova, </F>
under the general heading "Spring. Another Thaw in Russia?"; 
date and place not given: "Evening Conversation with Viktor 
Anpilov"] 
  [Text] On the very day that the decree on the amnesty was 
being adopted, the freedom-loving State Duma deputies from 
Russia's Choice began shouting: "Now Anpilov is getting out of 
Lefortovo and will call his thugs out onto the streets!" The 
same prediction was made by alarmed television commentators. 
"The freed criminals will cause unrest in Moscow" they said, 
trying to intimidate the viewers by showing the former convicts 
leaving prison. 
  Well, in that case how can you avoid asking the now freed 
Viktor Anpilov about the unrest that he is planning in Moscow? 
Here is his reply on his first evening at home. 
  [Anpilov] There will be no unrest. I have always strictly 
observed the laws. 
  [Nikiforova] Viktor Ivanovich, does that mean you do not 
regard yourself as guilty? 
  [Anpilov] It does not matter what I think. During the five 
months that I spent in prison they did not present a single 
piece of evidence against me even though from the very outset I 
wanted a judicial investigation and had even prepared my speech 
for the trial. But to call someone a criminal before the trial 
is not allowed even under the new Constitution. As I was 
leaving prison I said: If life had improved over these past 
five months that would have been the weightiest evidence of my 
guilt, but it has deteriorated considerably and people are 
protesting. Of course there must be an objective investigation 
into the causes and all the circumstances of the events of 
September and October. 
  [Nikiforova] Nevertheless, could you say a few words about 
your immediate plans.... 
  [Anpilov] I intend to travel and meet with labor 
collectives. I shall go to Tula, Vorkuta, Chelyabinsk, and 
Yekaterinburg -- I want to tell people the whole truth about 
what happened in May and September-October last year. In the 
conditions which have been created, the labor collectives must 
become owners of their own enterprises -- they alone have the 
right to dispose of everything built by them, they alone have 
the right to dispose of their output and set the wages of the 
administration. This will be the dictatorship of the 
proletariat. 
  [Nikiforova] So does that mean back to work for you? There 
must have been much to think about and reassess, surely? 
  [Anpilov] I wrote a book in prison -- I called it "The 
Lefortovo Dialogues. A Prison Synopsis of Hegel's Lectures." I 
wrote it in the form of the transcript of a conversation between 
a Prisoner and the great thinkers, from Socrates and Plato to 
Lenin. They are conversations about the state and the rule of 
law. The dialogue with Lenin was about how the greatest 
revolution was lost and why. 
  [Nikiforova] And in conclusion.... 
  [Anpilov] My thanks to the PRAVDA collective for their 
solidarity and support. Let us stand up together for the 
position of the struggling proletariat!

<F P=106> [Vasiliy Kononenko report: "Counterintelligence Chief </F>
Removed. This Is Only the Beginning...."] 
  [Text] In a democratic system you get surprises. One such 
surprise was the appearance of the State Duma's decision about 
the amnesty. Stories as to how this came about have been 
weighed up but it is impossible to weigh up everything, 
especially as this did lie in the power of those participating 
in the analysis. This is how the president's representative in 
the Federal Assembly A.M. Yakovlev evasively explained the 
release of the October mutiny's instigators and the pardoning of 
the members of the State Committee for the State of Emergency in 
accordance with the State Duma amnesty. He, together with his 
colleagues from the Russian Federation president's entourage Yu. 
Baturin and G. Satarov, held a briefing 28 February at the 
Kremlin, which was almost entirely devoted to an analysis of the 
situation which has developed over the State Duma's decree on 
the amnesty. 
  A.M. Yakovlev drew journalists' attention to the 
legislation's flaws which, according to him, were the reason for 
the presidential team's insufficiently clear and coordinated 
actions in response to the State Duma's decree on the amnesty. 
Apart from this, information was received claiming that work 
was in progress in the State Duma's apparatus with a view to 
amending the decree's text, and this factor was not taken into 
consideration. Moreover, a letter from General Prosecutor A. 
Kazannik was sent to the State Duma. It contained six basic 
points which essentially were aimed at removing the bias of the 
decree on the amnesty. Here, G. Satarov expressed himself more 
categorically: According to him it is actually the 
inconsistency in the stance of the Prosecutor's Office which has 
been a key element in this whole story. 
  The general prosecutor sends a letter to the State Duma 
saying that its decree on the amnesty violates Russian 
legislation, and then, with unprecedented speed for this 
department, adopts a decision about releasing this group of 
well-known people from custody. 
  G. Satarov was asked a question about the accuracy of 
reports 
that M. Gorbachev entertains the possibility that the document 
was submitted for President B. Yeltsin's preliminary approval. 
G. Satarov replied: "This issue could not have been submitted 
for the president's approval, which I. Rybkin confirmed in 
conversation with me 26 February." 
  Nevertheless, the briefing's participants assured us that 
they had expected such a turn of events, though they did not 
produce any arguments backing up what they said. According to 
Satarov, the president has planned corresponding actions 
concerning the defense of human rights which will be announced 
in the near future. 
  The journalists regarded the report that Federal 
Counterintelligence Service Director N. Golushko had been 
dismissed from his post (the president signed the relevant edict 
28 February) as a sensation.
