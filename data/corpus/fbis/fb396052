  [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1645 GMT on 1 March carries an 
8-minute "Current Affairs Commentator's Studio" program. The 
program starts with an introduction over video footage of the 
State Duma in session and Rutskoy and Khasbulatov being 
released. The amnesty is referred to as the focal point of the 
week. 
  The unidentified interviewer tells S.A. Filatov, head of the 
Russian president's administration, that he will ask him about 
the amnesty later, but first asks Filatov to speak about the 
decrees signed by Yeltsin last week. Filatov starts off by 
talking about Yeltsin's decree on the award to Patriarch Aleksey 
II of All Russia of the Order of the Friendship of Peoples on 
the occasion of his 60th birthday. He praises the patriarch for 
his work towards the stabilization of society and congratulates 
him. 
  Filatov states that 50 decrees were issued last week in all. 
He briefly refers to the decree on the release of Kazannik from 
the post of procurator general and his replacement. He 
discusses the two trends at the State Duma -- those who wish to 
get off to a fresh start without any investigations,and those 
who want to mark a political victory. Filatov does not perceive 
agreement among the parliamentarians in spite of such decisions 
as the "memorandum on accord. 
  The interviewer comments that a lot seemed to happen on the 
night of Friday to Saturday, and asks Filatov what he learned on 
a visit to the prosecutor's office today. Filatov complains 
that the procuracy was also riven with differences. He says 
that there seemed to be an instruction to release those 
amnestied as soon as possible. He notes that the president as 
the guarantor of the constitution was powerless to do anything 
about what happened. 
  The interviewer notes that Filatov spoke to the president 
this morning and asks Filatov what Yeltsin's reaction was. 
Filatov replies: "Well, the president is naturally concerned 
about what happened. Undoubtedly he is. The greatest 
perplexity is evoked by the fact that he addressed a definite 
message to the State Duma. He asked them to explain a number of 
positions, because in that message in general the question is 
formulated of it not being an amnesty but a pardon. This is the 
prerogative of the president alone. He asked for an explanation 
of these issues. At least one might have expected that no 
action would be taken until a reply was received to that 
message. Well, when it was necessary the Supreme Soviet even 
used to meet at night. If it was an emergency situation, the 
State Duma could have been convened quickly. They are here. 
They had not yet left Moscow for anywhere else. Therefore, if 
it is a question of an emergency or is becoming a question of an 
emergency, then one should react to that in the relevant manner. 
But to simply carry out the decision of the Duma just like 
that, or to compel it to be carried out, so to speak, without 
even replying to the president's message, is not just lack of 
respect, but one cannot even find the words to describe it. If 
there was such a a hurry -- the first question I put is why it 
was done in such a tearing hurry. Furthermore, they even told 
me that a duty officer was sitting in the editorial office of 
the State Duma, waiting to print the document in a hurry, and it 
was to be sat on for as long as possible before it went to the 
presidential structures. It was to be submitted in such a way 
that no reaction was any longer possible. But I did not know, I 
thought that Saturday and Sunday might turn out to be very 
serious in their consequences." 
  The interviewer asks Filatov whether executive power is 
ready 
to react sufficiently if Ampilov and his supporters organize 
street fighting again. Filatov replies that it is up to the 
State Duma to deal with that, since they have released people 
for whom they have taken responsibility, as it were. He 
stresses the need for the State Duma to understand its 
responsibilty and ensure the safety of the public.

<F P=106> [Sergey Turchenko report incorporating interview with </F>
Colonel General V.A. Achalov: "Three Days After State Duma 
Decision on Amnesty, Lefortovo Prisoners Have Been Freed"] 
  [Excerpts] Dozens of journalists and hundreds of 
representatives of the capital's patriotic movements gathered at 
the main entrance to Lefortovo Special Prison on the frosty 
morning of 26 February. And above the heads of the gathering 
could be seen crimson banners, numerous placards proclaiming 
"Freedom to the Defenders of the Motherland!" and "All Power to 
the Soviets!", and huge portraits of Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, 
Achalov, Makashov, and Anpilov.... [passage omitted] 
  The next morning, I met with Colonel General Vladislav 
Alekseyevich Achalov, and the first question I asked him was how 
he would explain the confusion that reigned as they were leaving 
Lefortovo, and why they came out through different gates. He 
answered: 
  [Achalov] It is clear that the amnesty decision was 
coordinated with Yeltsin. But it is perfectly obvious what 
pressure was put on him by "Russia's Choice" and the other 
ardent democrats. The result of this pressure was, evidently, 
Yeltsin's appeal to Kazannik proposing a delay. So that to the 
end, no one knew for sure whether we would be freed or not. It 
was only at 1500 hours that the investigator summoned me and 
said that the decision had been made, and I gathered my things. 
The prison chiefs came into the cell and said good-bye. We 
were all warned that a very large crowd had gathered at the main 
entrance. They asked us whether we intended to give interviews. 
I asked which mass media had gathered there. I was told: 
Mainly the foreign and "democratic" mass media. I refused to 
give an interview and decided to come out through the staff 
door. Everyone did what they considered feasible. 
  [Turchenko] What is your attitude to the amnesty? 
  [Achalov] I do not perceive this amnesty as my having 
received a pardon. I am not guilty of anything. Judge for 
yourselves. The only thing that they questioned me about in 
five months was who was with me and what I was doing 21 
September through 4 October. There was not one confrontation, 
not one identification. And, as of 17 December, the questioning 
stopped altogether -- there was nothing to ask about. True, 
they did submit forensic findings on the corpses. It was 
terrible! Some of them had up to 15 bullet wounds. Was it 
really necessary to shoot people? Those are the cases which 
should be investigated. 
  [Turchenko] What are your plans for the future? 
  [Achalov] The State Duma has elaborated a stance of national 
reconciliation. No matter where I work, I will support it. I 
know what war is, and I do not want our people to experience it 
in full measure. The people themselves have already realized 
what's what. The elections showed this. And the fact that 
Gaydar has now left the government means that he has run away 
from responsibility. Other "national zealots" are doing the 
same. Sooner or later, the people will make them answerable. 
But now we have to think about how to save Russia and prevent a 
civil war. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Feature by Yuriy Dmitriyev, Nikolay Dorofeyev, and Nikolay </F>
Kishkin: "`Universal Forgiveness': Does This Road Lead to the 
Temple of Accord?"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] What Are We To Expect? 
  This question is of concern to everyone now. Will the hasty 
amnesty not entail outbursts of extremism and lead to a new 
standoff of the powers? Journalists asked presidential 
apparatus staffers about this at a briefing yesterday. 
  A. Yakovlev, the president's representative in parliament, 
does not rule out such a development of events. In his opinion, 
special attention must be given to May Day this year, which, if 
we recall the past, might be exploited by extremist forces. 
Presidential aide G. Satarov declared that B. Yeltsin is taking 
measures to iron out as far as possible the negative 
consequences of what has happened. At the same time the same 
intention can be perceived among a section of deputies, or, at 
any rate, among those who voted for the act of amnesty in the 
sincere belief that it would lead to civil reconciliation. For 
Satarov believes (and Duma Speaker I. Rybkin concurs) that the 
deputies have become the hostages of their own decision and of 
the future conduct of those whom they have set free, and so an 
outburst of extremism and an exacerbation of the political 
situation will strike at their authority above all. Of course, 
we must not disregard the fact that there are forces, in 
parliament too, which will attempt to start their own political 
game on the basis of the act of amnesty. But it is not they, in 
the end, who play the decisive role. 
  The presidential spokesmen resolutely rejected the report 
that appeared somewhere or other alleging that the president is 
preparing a state of emergency to combat crime, which will then 
be used to crush the opposition. "Nonsense," came the reply. 
Such rumors are being spread for the quite deliberate purpose 
of inflaming the situation in the country.... 
  Satarov does not believe that the release of the Lefortovo 
inmates will sharply complicate cooperation between the 
president and parliament. Following the head of state's 
message, Duma committees have begun constructive work on 
implementing the strategic plan enshrined in that document. It 
has itself been greeted with understanding in parliament. 
  Yet, what are the implications of a return to politics by 
the 
organizers of the October riots, and will it materialise? R. 
Khasbulatov can scarcely count on anything. Evidently realizing 
this, he has already made the statement that he will not engage 
in political activity. As for A. Rutskoy, the possibility 
cannot be ruled out that his name will be exploited by 
antipresidential forces to undermine the policy of reforms. V. 
Mironov, deputy chairman of the State Duma Security Committee, 
believes that "the organizers of the October events might be 
thrown by the opposition, like penal battalions, into 
undermining democracy and civil peace." V. Anpilov has already 
shown up at a noisy rally in Teatralnaya and declared his 
intention "to fight against the present regime" right after 
coming out of Lefortovo. 
  If, after the amnesty, the political struggle develops not 
in 
civilized forms, then the factions which voted for it, basing 
their stance on the search for civil peace, will find themselves 
in a very difficult position. This primarily concerns the Party 
of Russian Unity and Accord, whose votes enabled the Duma to 
adopt the decision to release the Lefortovo inmates. Evidently 
sensing this, S. Shakhray, the party's leader, has already 
issued a statement: "The political organizations which sought 
only a political amnesty must assume responsibility for the 
actions of the freed leaders. If they intend to continue the 
struggle at the elections, like other citizens of the Russian 
Federation, this is a normal phenomenon; but if their chosen 
means of struggle is appeals to seize, destroy, or shoot, this 
means that new criminal cases will be instituted and there will 
be no accord and reconciliation." 
  The possibility cannot be ruled out that in the event of an 
outburst of extremism parliament will have to take some 
additional measures if it wants to be aware of the danger to the 
country of such a development of events. Deputy K. Zatulin, for 
example, proposed "discussing in the Duma the question of a 
possible ban on political activity by active participants in the 
events of October 1993." 
  In the meanwhile it is clear that things have not become 
calmer in the country at this time.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vyacheslav Kostikov, Russian president's </F>
press secretary, by Olga Kuchkina; place and date not given: 
"Who Does President Go to the Bathhouse With? Questions Put to 
Press Secretary and His Replies"] 
  [Text] [Kuchkina] What does the press secretary's job 
entail: dispelling rumors, telling the truth as it is, shaping 
the president's image, or to some extent adjusting policy? 
  [Kostikov] This job is relatively new in our political 
setup, and there are no hard-and-fast rules. When I had my 
first conversation with B.N. [Yeltsin] he set me no tasks, 
evidently based on my sound reputation as a democratic 
journalist. So the press service and the press secretary have 
been shaped by me myself depending on my level of political 
culture and, of course, society's level of political development. 
  [Kuchkina] What is the mechanism for your statements? At 
the president's request? Your own initiative, when you have 
picked something out? Do you make a statement autonomously or 
do you agree everything with the president? 
  [Kostikov] It depends on the specific case. If what is 
needed is an official reaction on a complex question with 
political or economic consequences, everything is agreed. 
  [Kuchkina] Even including the wording? 
  [Kostikov] As a rule the president sets the political tone. 
He says two or three key phrases which provide the opportunity 
to formulate something in the context of the situation that has 
arisen. There are various forms depending on the weight we want 
to impart to the statement. For instance, sometimes I say: I 
am authorized to state -- then it is clearly coming from the 
president. Whether [a statement is made] on the president's or 
the press secretary's initiative, it is always with the 
president's consent. But the press secretary has no pretensions 
to pass everything off as the president's opinion. 
  [Kuchkina] What if B.N. reacts to something by saying: Why 
did you do that? 
  [Kostikov] That has not happened. I may be mistaken as to a 
particular detail, but the president is too broad-minded a man 
and too big a statesman to react to minor mistakes. 
  [Kuchkina] I had thought about your job and wanted to ask 
certain questions when I saw and heard on television something 
the whole country saw and heard, once and then a second time, 
namely that on Saturdays Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy 
apparently goes to the bathhouse with the president and plays 
checkers with him, and that he is generally pleased that 
everything is proceeding correctly; Gaydar and Fedorov have 
already departed and Kozyrev and Chubays are next in line; that 
is, it is as if he gives the orders and the president executes 
them obediently, which amounts to a public backslapping of the 
president. It is apparently the press secretary's job to give 
society some explanation regarding this, and I waited for you to 
do so. You kept silent. Why? Is it an oversight or did you 
have nothing to object to since the foregoing is the truth? 
  [Kostikov] I will explain why I did not react. Naturally it 
is utter nonsense: Zhirinovskiy has not once met with the 
president tete-a-tete, he was invited to the Kremlin only once 
for a meeting with B.N. as one of a number of faction leaders on 
the threshold of the elections and referendum. 
  [Kuchkina] That is, no personal meetings? 
  [Kostikov] None. The president did not go to the bathhouse 
with him, did not walk along snowy paths, did not drink cognac, 
and did not sit down at the same table. It is typical loudmouth 
mendacity on Zhirinovskiy's part. Which, incidentally, is not 
characteristic of him alone. It is a level of nonsense to which 
the press secretary should not react. 
  [Kuchkina] I cannot agree with you. What is obvious to you 
is completely unobvious to the mass of people who, having 
swallowed some piece of information, draw their own conclusions. 
Not about Zhirinovskiy as a loudmouth liar who takes people in 
but who does not have a hand laid on him, but about a turnaround 
by Yeltsin and about a possible secret pact with Zhirinovskiy, 
about which certain politicians and newspapermen both here and 
in the West are readily spreading rumors. I think these things 
do great harm to the president and his policies. A mass attack 
is in progress. Several times I have been sent local 
newspapers, most of which are in the hands of the democrats' 
opponents, let us call them that, and they print the most brazen 
lies, the most blatant antidemocratic, antipresidential 
propaganda, and in the provinces people simply read the local 
press and believe it. Especially when the voice of denial does 
not reach them from here. Up to now television has been a kind 
of government channel and if Zhirinovskiy says something on it, 
that means it is true. The democrats' arrogance has already 
played its fateful role. Why repeat the same mistakes? Why not 
issue a press release one day saying that this, this, and this 
are lies? In any form, even a witty one. In my view one simply 
has to "lower oneself." Not to political intrigues but to 
people who are interested to know whether the Liberal Democratic 
Party leader is in fact so powerful. 
  [Kostikov] I think the press has fallen down on the job 
here. If a journalist, an agency, or a newspaper had called me 
the next day and asked, I would have responded. I dream of 
giving weekly briefings for journalists. The organizational 
difficulty is that to hold them without a preliminary 
conversation between the press secretary and the president would 
be of no interest to journalists, and B.N. has a very hectic 
schedule. But I had a conversation with B.N. on this subject 
and he agreed that before every briefing we would have a quiet 
half-hour together. I hope that he has now recovered, God grant 
him health.... 
  [Kuchkina] Let us talk about health. The well-known story 
of the telephone conversation that never took place, when one 
president could not find the other, or the other could not wait 
long by the telephone -- here you expressed yourself in the same 
way as you did regarding items in the press associated with the 
subject of health. True, rather mutedly. I rarely frequent 
"society," but every time I do I hear "totally accurate" 
information "received from competent sources" that the president 
has a tumor in this or that place, that he is not long for this 
world, that soon everything will be over. I live near the White 
House: In September-October these rumors were being 
persistently spread among the crowd there. They have now spread 
to official offices, to ceremonial launches, and everyone 
declares that he knows all about this. I would like to hear 
information from you because I know how disinformation is 
circulated, including that with a political aim. 
  [Kostikov] You have partly answered the question yourself. 
As regards the telephone: When communications are set up, and 
that means interpreters and technical services enter the 
conversation -- both presidents have to be near the telephone. 
Our president was at the telephone twice. He waited a decent 
time but Clinton was either not in the vicinity or was late. 
Indeed, when Clinton was here we saw that he was tardy for 
every event. 
  [Kuchkina] Did Yavlinskiy not tell journalists that Clinton 
could not get through to Yeltsin but his American acquaintance 
got through to him at night, saying: Grisha, if you have the 
only telephone in Russia on which it is possible to converse, 
why do you and not the president have it? 
  [Kostikov] Well, that is halfway to being a joke among 
friends. As regards ill health. The press and society are 
entitled to monitor the president's health and demand reports on 
it, but only when this is done normally and with good 
intentions, whereas when political speculation begins.... That 
is why I said God grant him health. When you work long enough 
in a particular team a element of family feeling arises. I say 
this as I used to say God grant health to Vasiliy Semenovich, my 
father, when he was alive. Or like I say this to my mother. It 
is natural human warmth. But on the other hand, you realize 
that the president's health is national capital, especially in 
our case, when the level of political stability in the country 
depends directly on Yeltsin. Therefore we all suffer when B.N. 
becomes run-down or catches a cold, like now, or, like six 
months ago, when his radiculitis became exacerbated. As regards 
speculation, I have noticed that this wave usually begins 
abroad, and in a few days safely completes the migration to our 
press. There is nothing accidental here, the president is a 
major political figure who stands in many people's way. Just 
watch which newspapers this appears in -- the attentive reader 
or analyst will see everything clearly. 
  [Kuchkina] That just applies to an analyst. While I, I 
repeat, am talking about society, which does not consist wholly 
of analysts, and this massive barrage of rumors is doing its 
destructive work. 
  [Kostikov] My position is that it is still necessary to take 
account of people's psychology. For 70 years it has not been 
the done thing in this country to talk about the health of 
supreme great leaders [vozhd] and other leaders [lider]. Just 
like before those 70 years. In churches prayers were said every 
day for the health of the sovereign emperor, but that is as far 
as it went. In the people's opinion the leader is somewhere 
high up there and there are things about which it is not done to 
speak. Unlike the West, where a leader's every step and every 
gesture is on view, and the leaders themselves encourage this. 
B.N.'s health is entirely normal for a man of his age. His 
mother died recently at a ripe old age, all his relatives have 
lived a very long time, and he comes from very vigorous genetic 
stock. 
  [Kuchkina] So everything I mentioned is lies? 
  [Kostikov] Even dishonorable lies. 
  [Kuchkina] What about the rumor that he is completely 
incapable of working, not up to the job, insane?... 
  [Kostikov] The situation is completely the reverse. The 
president is doing a great deal of work. He is a workaholic. 
He virtually works a 24-hour day. 
  [Kuchkina] I think you are incorrect in saying that in the 
people's opinion a leader is somewhere high up and remote. We 
have managed to get used to Yeltsin as a democratic leader, as 
one of us, which is why the people followed him as a person who 
is close to them. But lately he has somehow kept aloof at 
inaccessible heights, he has shut himself away. It is the 
accepted thing to gossip about his aloofness at crucial and 
noncrucial moments. This particularly applies to the night of 3 
October -- why he did not address television viewers? In this 
case I personally know why. Because at that time he was tackling 
a task of immense importance and he had to solve it before 
appearing on the screen and addressing the people. But why is 
he absent now? Notwithstanding the fact that he is terribly 
busy he must return to contacts with society in one form or 
another. 
  [Kostikov] I quite agree with you, and the letters we are 
receiving contain the refrain: Return our president of old to 
us, we want to see him on a truck with a megaphone, in a crowd, 
among us.... 
  [Kuchkina] No, I do not buy that, I subscribe to a 
completely different view. A change of tasks has occurred. 
  [Kostikov] Yes. Previously it was necessary to win power in 
order to protect democracy, power is now in his hands. An 
enormous country and an enormous burden of power. 
  [Kuchkina] I am not talking about going on walkabouts among 
the people or about video clips. I am talking about necessary 
appearances and the manifestation of his presidential will now, 
when the social situation is so complex. 
  [Kostikov] The situation is in fact alarming. The state of 
the Federal Assembly, especially the State Duma, causes the 
greatest concern. There were hopes that the Duma would be 
different, more professional, and wiser, but we can see that 
leaders of factions are not at all concerned that Russia needs 
judicial reform, laws which would indicate the parameters of a 
market economy. So much time has passed but the Duma has still 
not gotten down to its legislative work. Many leaders went 
there to make political capital, to flex their political biceps. 
  [Kuchkina] You are emphasizing the Duma at a time when a 
considerable amount of criticism has been concentrated on the 
government, and it can be seen that changing its course involves 
danger, as does changing the president's course. But I want to 
draw your attention to Kronid Lyubarskiy's sensational NOVOYE 
VREMYA article entitled "Falsification." Apart from describing 
cases of blatant substitution [?of ballot rigging] [podstanovka] 
and sharp practice, the author resorts to scientific 
mathematical models and shows that if there is a constant 
electorate in cities of 70 percent for reforms, 20 percent 
against, and 10 percent neither for nor against, that is, 
Zhirinovskiy's former electorate, and scientifically speaking it 
is impossible to have such a change of correlations as occurred 
12 December. The falsifiers were convinced that a thief is not 
a thief unless he is caught in the act. But mathematics is a 
crafty thing, it reveals deceit even in places where it has 
apparently been well concealed. In this context the author 
talks of the "poorly heard voice of the majority," in adapting 
to which the president and government have started adjusting 
their policy, and that is their dramatic mistake. 
  [Kostikov] First, summaries of, so to speak, states of 
mind, sentiments, and expectations are regularly put on the 
president's desk. He is aware of all this. Second, I do not 
know of a single step by the president which would attest to a 
change in his democratic orientation. If you listen to his 
Message to the Federal Assembly, all guidelines for democratic 
reforms are clearly stipulated there. There is no retreat. 
  [Kuchkina] What about the departure of Gaydar and Fedorov? 
  [Kostikov] It was they who departed. The president did not 
instigate their departure in any way. On the contrary, as far 
as I know he devoted a great deal of effort to get Gaydar, 
Pamfilova, and Fedorov to stay. 
  [Kuchkina] People say that the president is powerless in 
relation to the premier? 
  [Kostikov] There is no powerlessness of any kind. The 
president and the premier each have their own set of powers. 
B.N. does not want to violate this setup and interfere in all 
the actions of another plenipotentiary figure. At the end of 
the day economic policy is entrusted to the premier. The 
president determines the broad course. But the government 
implements it. The president can dismiss the entire government, 
but first it must have a chance to carry out the president's 
wishes, implementing them by the methods which it thinks best. 
I personally think that Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin himself 
does not realize the full extent of the seriousness of the 
aspirations of those who are acting behind his back. 
  [Kuchkina] What about his consultations with Starodubtsev? 
  [Kostikov] You know, I would very much like B.N. to ask the 
premier this question in a personal conversation. Does 
Starodubtsev have such a wealth of experience in forming the 
agricultural economy's structures that in the reform process 
they will ultimately be able to start feeding Russia? In this 
sense has the experience of the State Committee for the State of 
Emergency been devalued? Generally the president and premier 
have good personal contacts. In addition, while highly 
appraising Gaydar's acts on the night of 3-4 October, when he 
went out into the square in front of Moscow City Soviet, I 
cannot fail to give due credit to Chernomyrdin's chivalrous -- 
in the full sense of the word -- conduct on the same and the 
preceding days, when he adopted a pro-presidential position 
without hesitation and did not deviate from it. 
  [Kuchkina] That is correct. But what can you say about 
Chernomyrdin's defense of Gerashchenko? The democratic press 
has been full of criticism of Gerashchenko's autonomous policy 
associated with the "illegal cash office," whereby prior to the 
October days "under-the-counter" trillions disappeared goodness 
knows where, that is, it is known where -- on support for the 
Supreme Soviet; with monetary reform in the summer; and with the 
unification of finances with Belarus, for which Russians will 
pay dearly, and a clear position on the restoration of the 
Soviet empire can be discerned behind everything. 
  [Kostikov] Oh, how I would love to obtain answers to all 
these questions! But allow me to confine myself to saying that. 
  [Kuchkina] Which of the president's reactions do you recall 
as being the strongest? 
  [Kostikov] Like every Russian man he is very emotional 
inside and restrained outwardly. Maybe one moment has remained 
the most striking for me. When his mother died. For the first 
and only time I saw him weep. And again when people were 
preparing to impeach him and he went out onto the congress 
platform without preparation and delivered himself of a very 
powerful emotional performance. 
  [Kuchkina] Do you happen to know why the president said in a 
conversation with Ryazanov that he never thinks about death? Is 
he not afraid of dying? 
  [Kostikov] I think...because he has already done something 
for Russia. Who is afraid of dying? He who has done nothing, 
accomplished nothing, and not fulfilled himself. B.N. is doing 
something to which he devotes his whole self as a moral person.

  [Editorial Report] St. Petersburg Fifth Channel Television 
in Russian at 2000 GMT on 20 February 1994 as the final item of 
ITOGI, broadcasts an interview with Sergey Filatov, head of the 
Russian President's administration and Viktor Ilyushin, 
Yeltsin's first aide by announcer Yevgeniy Kiselev. 
  Kiselev begins his report by saying that a plan for 
restructuring the presidential staff was submitted to Yeltsin 
and, according to Kiselev, was approved by the president on 18 
February. Rumor has it that two conflicting plans were drawn up 
by Filatov and by Ilyushin, Kiselev say. Did this mean that the 
presidential entourage was split into two conflicting groupings 
led by these two people? The joint interview by Filatov and 
Ilyushin was given specially to clarify the situation. 
  Kiselev asks them which of their two plans Yeltsin had given 
preference to. Filatov says: "We have a joint, agreed version 
on which we worked together. We are in fact continuing to form 
the presidential administration -- a process started last year. 
It has two aspects. The president's aides are in charge of one 
aspect that involves day-to-day organization of work and 
operational assistance. The other is the bureaucratic aspect 
that deals with the purely administrative facilities for 
implementing this work." 
  When Kiselev asks again whose plan Yeltsin had chosen, 
Ilyushin answers: "I would like to say that there is only one 
leader in the administration, Sergey Aleksandrovich Filatov. I 
would like to stress that all presidential aides are members of 
the presidential administration, and that all structures within 
the administration are working for the president. It is simply 
that a certain part of it, the president's cabinet as we call 
it, or his aides, is working in a slightly closer contact with 
the president than some other structures." 
  Filatov and Ilyushin both say there were no disagreements 
between them. 
  Ilyushin then says: "An episode comes to my mind that 
occurred about a month ago. Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin invited 
me to his office and asked: `Viktor Vasilyevich, is it true that 
you are preparing a plan for the presidential administration 
where the president's aides would play the decisive role in all 
organizational matters?' This question surprised me because 
there had been many different plans." 
  Kiselev then asks if the current reorganization of the 
president's staff meant its expansion. Filatov says that the 
overall number of people employed in the administration will 
remain the same, about 2,000, including technical personnel. 
Ilyushin adds that the aides' department consisted of 38 people 
and that the aide for national security issues was soon to have 
his own staff. 
  The conversation than switches to President Yeltsin's state 
of health. Kiselev asks if Yeltsin really had a severe cold or 
if there were political reasons behind his illness. Ilyushin 
replies: "I have known Boris Nikolayevich long enough to be able 
to say that he does not fall ill easily, but if it does happen, 
it takes him a long time to get over it. I think this is a 
typical feature of strong people. As for the present situation 
-- yes, he is a bit unwell but of course we must take his age 
into consideration, and anyway, if all invalids worked as he is 
working now, things would be moving much faster in Russia." 
Kiselev says that Yeltsin has a tendency to withdraw from 
public at times of serious crises and recalled several occasions 
from the past three years when this happened. Ilyushin 
disagrees: "True, our president sometimes reserves his judgment 
but eventually he always states his opinion. And it seems to me 
that he always does it at the right moment. It is 
characteristic of Boris Nikolayevich to know when it is the 
right time to state his views." 
  Kiselev and Ilyushin then discuss the question whether 
Yeltsin's personal life should be in the focus of public 
attention as much as that of U.S. presidents. Ilyushin says it 
was a foreign tradition alien to Russia and moreover, that 
Yeltsin disliked being in the public eye. However, they agreed 
that he ought to be warned that a greater openness was expected 
of him. Filatov says: "Such matters usually get whipped up 
before some very serious political events. Apparently, 
preparations for another period of tension and confrontation are 
under way. God save us from this," to which Kiselev replies: 
"Well, in that case a greater openness to the press on the part 
of the president could knock the trump cards from the hands of 
his opponents."

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Krivov, leader of Kremlin group of </F>
experts, by Stanislav Stremidlovskiy; place and date not given: 
"Who Gets Poor Marks for Prompting the President?"] 
  [Text] Quite honestly, I find it hard to recall instances 
when Russian President Boris Yeltsin has not been rebuked for 
unexpected decisions which he has discussed with no one. The 
president adopts an edict, and the interested top officials at 
once spread their hands: We did not know about this, nobody 
told us anything. Or: Did he consult with anyone at all?... 
  Back in the times of the USSR Boris Yeltsin, not yet 
president, was approached by two people -- Igor Vasilyevich Nit 
and Pavel Alekseyevich Medvedev, professors at Moscow State 
University -- who proposed setting up a group of expert 
economists. It was then that they reached agreement on the 
rules: They would always tell Yeltsin the truth, and he would 
always be ready to listen to them. Some staffers, postgraduates 
of the Department of Mathematical Methods of Analyzing the 
Economy at Moscow State University, and scientists from the 
Academy of Sciences came along with Nit and Medvedev. At first 
they worked on a purely voluntary basis. But now the group of 
experts is accommodated in the Kremlin. Last year Igor Nit, its 
founder, passed away, and Viktor Krivov acts as the group's 
leader. We put our first question to him. 
  [Stremidlovskiy] You are an expert. Please assess how Boris 
Nikolayevich adopts decisions. 
  [Krivov] Although the president is frequently accused of 
adopting decisions hurriedly, in actual fact the overwhelming 
majority of them are carefully worked out. How competent the 
advisers and specialists to whom the president turns are is 
another matter. I will point out that Yeltsin endeavors to 
obtain at least two viewpoints on each question. 
  [Stremidlovskiy] How capable is Boris Yeltsin of taking on 
board information which is unpleasant to him? 
  [Krivov] A difficult question. Of course, the president is 
a man of character, and he knows how to get angry. And yet he 
is a man with a very strong will, and so he is able to suppress 
emotions. 
  [Stremidlovskiy] Has it ever happened that your opinion and 
Boris Nikolayevich's opinion on some questions have differed? 
  [Krivov] Yes. For example, with regard to the "500 Days" 
program. We were categorically against it in our conclusion and 
emphasized that this plan did not correspond at all to the 
country for which it was being written. 
  [Stremidlovskiy] At what percentage do you estimate your 
influence over Yeltsin? 
  [Krivov] There is still a very serious problem here. It was 
one thing that Igor Nit, our late leader, exerted real 
influence. We have not yet attained such weight.... 
  [Stremidlovskiy] How frequently does the president consult 
with your group? 
  [Krivov] This happens most frequently now through the 
president's aides -- Ilyushin, Korabelshchikov, Sukhanov. Or 
through political consultants. 
  [Stremidlovskiy] Many people today believe that the 
president is dealing less with the government now.... 
  [Krivov] He is doing this deliberately. When Yeltsin headed 
the government, he dealt with it. Now there is a prime minister 
whom the president trusts. But control over the course of the 
reforms is still retained. Every Tuesday there are one-to-two 
hour meetings between Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin, at which 
fundamental aspects of the government's work are discussed. 
  [Stremidlovskiy] Viktor Dmitriyevich, why, in your view, 
did the president accept the resignations of Gaydar and Fedorov? 
  [Krivov] In our country the concept "reformer" is like a 
label. But essentially.... It is important at some stage 
resolutely to break what is old, while at another time it is 
time to engage in building. 
  Whereas in 1990 Yeltsin's victory was linked with the fact 
that he had geared himself to the enterprise directors, today 
entrepreneurs have appeared. Therefore it is obvious that the 
next government must be a government of entrepreneurs. The only 
entrepreneur whom I know is Chernomyrdin. His presence in the 
Cabinet of Ministers serves to guarantee the transformations' 
continuation. 
  But the actions of members of the previous government 
frequently resembled the actions of people dropped by parachute 
into a foreign country. 
  [Stremidlovskiy] But Chernomyrdin's present cabinet is 
called a government of "red directors...." 
  [Krivov] I believe that the directors are no longer the same 
now. Essentially, each of them has become an entrepreneur. 
They have large accounts in Western banks, and they seek 
contracts. But, believe me, more serious problems exist in the 
economy than "red directors." 
  [Stremidlovskiy] Which ones? 
  [Krivov] Owing to the inefficiency of our economy, our 
prices, particularly those for raw materials, exceed world 
prices. The saddest thing is that just a few people understand 
the significance of this problem -- only Chernomyrdin. 
  We will have nothing with which to buy imported consumer 
goods, which we import now. 
  We still have six months in which we can use administrative 
methods to make the railroad carry freight more cheaply, at a 
loss to itself. To make energy workers also trade at a loss to 
themselves. But during this time we will prepare the 
foundations for the structural restructuring of the Russian 
economy. 
  [Stremidlovskiy] It turns out that additional loads will be 
imposed on the sinking budget -- from here it is one step to 
hyperinflation.... 
  [Krivov] Inflation is, of course, a serious matter. But the 
fact that enterprises are now coming to a halt is no less a 
problem. Closing our eyes to this trend means getting a 
seething, mutinous country in a few months' time....

<F P=106> [Article by State Duma Deputy Boris Fedorov: "The Pause in </F>
the Reform Process Has Become Protracted. It Is Time To End It"] 
  [Text] These words in the president's message to the 
Federal Assembly cannot fail to instill cautious optimism. 
Indeed, after three months of equivocation and hesitation, it 
is time to get down to business. 
  Most inspiring of all was the president's unequivocal stance 
on inflation, which "is inflicting huge damage on the reform 
itself and on the quality of the lives of the population and the 
economy as a whole." "The crisis is insuperable in conditions 
of unchecked inflation," the president believes. After numerous 
dubious statements from individual government members and 
competing pseudoprograms, this is more than timely and should 
promote the cessation of fruitless discussions. 
  The president's indication of the need to establish by the 
end of 1994 a level of inflation of 3-5 percent per month, which 
certainly hardly squares with the statements of the prime 
minister and the acting minister of finance, is a real 
sensation. Still tougher are the president's words concerning 
the verification of all actions of the authorities to ensure 
that they carry no inflation risk to the state. Otherwise, the 
president's direct intervention cannot be ruled out, up to and 
including the exercise of his constitutional powers. 
  The president could not have expressed himself more 
uncompromisingly. Now the question arises: How will the 
government react? It has twice already postponed its session 
and more often speaks of inflation priority in terms of 10 or 
15-18 percent by the end of the year. For the information of 
those who are interested: The president's guideline of 3 
percent means a 40-percent growth of prices per annum, and the 
government's guideline, even at 10 percent (which is 
improbable), represents a more than threefold increase of 
prices. The difference is collossal. How are these 
incompatible guidelines to be squared? 
  Inflation is a fundamental issue of reform. In order to 
crush it, political will and decisive actions to reduce 
expenditure are necessary. At the moment we are being offered 
an extremely dubious budget deficit of 50 trillion rubles [R], 
R19 trillion of which is proposed to be funded from external 
sources. I will not say any more about the budget's inflated 
tax revenue, but who can seriously expect to receive more than 
$10 billion from abroad? Or as much as R4.5 trillion in revenue 
through issuing securities? You can dress up the figures as 
much as you like, but not to that extent. Be sensible. 
  Two months have passed, and all the Central Bank's credits 
for the first quarter have already been spent. On what legal 
basis will expenditure in March rest? When will the budget be 
presented to parliament, and how quickly will it be possible to 
adjust it to suit the president's wishes? In its current form, 
even if it is accepted as correct, it does not correspond even 
to inflation of 10 percent per month. Either the government 
will take decisive measures, or it will act against the 
president. 
  Inflation can and should be stopped quickly. The investment 
process should be stimulated, and public savings encouraged. 
For this, political will and a ruthless battle against 
mismanagement, corruption, and incompetence are needed. People 
are needed who are capable of making decisions, accepting 
responsibility, and achieving results, and not simply beating 
their chests and saying: "We will never retreat." 
  It is time to stop putting up with chameleons and 
lickspittles who sell their convictions with every new gust of 
the political wind. Meanwhile, they continue to drive out 
original thinkers and efficient people from the organs of power 
on ridiculous pretexts. The latest example is Kupriyanovskiy, 
chief of administration in the president's administration.... 
Of course, one man does not decide everything. But it is 
individual people in their sum who determine policy. The 
composition of the government is mirrored in policy. Today it 
is not clear who can, and who conscientiously will, implement 
the line denoted by the president. 
  I do not agree with the description of the president's 
message as a party congress speech. Read the text carefully, 
and everything will become clear. The message contains a host 
of specific ideas on investments, payments, the standard of 
living, and agrarian and industrial policy. Quite a lot is said 
about the Central Bank, which is to be transformed into a 
federal reserve system, and about relations between the regions 
and the center. 
  Most importantly of all, the message gives an objective 
analysis of the situation and the progress of reform in the last 
two-and-a-half years. There are many references to specific 
mistakes, inconsistency, and economic policy becoming dependent 
on political confrontation. The government's failures are 
repeatedly indicated, and the possibility of decisive 
intervention by the president is unambiguously hinted. 
  It is also highly important that not one word in the 
president's message supported a shift in economic policy, the 
talk of the "end of economic romanticism," or a transition to 
certain "nonmonetarist methods" in the struggle with the 
stop-start nature of inflation. It is clearly stated: The 
course is to be the same as before, but it must be more 
consistent, considered, and professional. 
  Now, Boris Nikolayevich, specific actions are expected from 
you and the prime minister. It is the government's duty to 
provide specific calculations of economic policy and of the 
guidelines for the year, including on inflation, the standard of 
living, and other highly important socioeconomic indicators, so 
that at the beginning of next year it can be said that 
everything possible has been done for the revival of Russia. 
  A few days remain until the government session. The pause in 
the reform process has become protracted. It is time to end it, 
and it is possible to end it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Valentin Lazutkin, first deputy leader of </F>
the Russian Federal Service for Television and Radio 
Broadcasting, by Anatoliy Vystorobets; place and date not given: 
"State Television Is To Be"] 
  [Text] In his address to deputies of the Russian 
parliament, Russian President B.N. Yeltsin stated that the 
television channel whose influence extends to the CIS countries 
and to several East European countries should remain 
state-owned. The name of the channel was not given. We 
approached Valentin Lazutkin, first deputy leader of the Russian 
Federal Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting, asking 
him to clarify the issue in question. 
  [Lazutkin] I welcomed this statement by Boris Nikolayevich 
Yeltsin with great enthusiasm and hope. Finally, a real 
opportunity emerges to resolve in a dignified and coherent 
manner the questions of preserving and consolidating the 
positions of Russian national television. 
  Ostankino's first channel is a button which is hotter than 
the nuclear button. In my opinion, the president's address to 
deputies evinced an understanding of this fact and an awareness 
of high responsibility. The first channel is working for the 
long term, for the life and development of the CIS countries and 
the unification of their economic, information, and cultural 
areas. 
  [Vystorobets] At the same time Ostankino's corridors are 
awash with rumors about the company's imminent flotation. 
  [Lazutkin] I would not call the idea of floating Ostankino a 
brilliant one. There are more intentions here than 
realistically calculated possibilities. At any rate, I do not 
know of a single existing model of flotation capable of 
satisfying the civic and public requirement for a national 
television channel and ensuring its high-quality and 
uninterrupted operation. 
  And when all is said and done, the debate over the flotation 
of the federal channel is contrived and artificial. But it is 
infectious and dangerous. Imagine, if someone had the idea of 
floating missile complexes or tank troops. Ridiculous! But the 
strategic significance of federal television as the most 
powerful factor in Russia's information and cultural influence 
is immeasurable. 
  [Vystorobets] Does this mean that the president's address 
reflected certain views held by the leadership of the Russian 
Federal Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting? 
  [Lazutkin] I am happy that our views coincide. 
  [Vystorobets] Don't you consider the existence in Russia of 
two state television and radio broadcasting companies as strange? 
  [Lazutkin] When I speak of the opportunity for a coherent 
and dignified resolution of the questions of Russian state 
television, I primarily have this problem in mind. Its solution 
is quite simple, and, most importantly, expedient. The 
possibility for the normal development of federalwide television 
and radio broadcasting, for the normal function of the 90-plus 
regional state television broadcasting companies will thereby be 
attained.

  [Text] Moscow March 1 TASS -- The Russian 
counter-intelligence service arrested a leading Russian official 
from an organisation of the military-industrial complex for 
spying for the British secret services. 
  The Russian military prosecutor's office is carrying out the 
investigation. 
  The arrested man is charged with treason in the form of 
espionage, TASS was told by a source in the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service on Tuesday who added that the spy 
had been arrested on January 15, and admitted to the charges on 
January 25. 
  The service said that, according to preliminary 
investigation, the official had been supplied with materials for 
invisible writing amd means of secretly passing information to 
his control in the British embassy in Moscow. 
  "On orders from the British special services and for 
monetary 
remuneration, the Russian citizen collected and passed (to a 
foreign power) classified information of military and economic 
character", the source said. 
  The counter-intelligence service source said the spy had 
sold 
data about Russia's latest research in the field of new 
armaments and their technical characteristics, on financing 
military research and development, on the state and prospects of 
Russian military cooperation with other countries. 
  Speaking to ITAR-TASS, a service spokesman, Aleksandr 
Mikhailov stressed that the arrest "is in no way connected with 
the Ames' case", but noted that while the American court has yet 
to prove aims' guilt, "the arrested spy was caught in the action 
with all the spying devices on him". 
  A British embassy official, directly out of a working 
meeting 
with a London official in the embassy, declined to comment, 
saying the embassy would not normally issue comments for the 
press. She denied the meeting in the embassy had anything to do 
with the case.

  [Text] Moscow, 2 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- The Russian citizen 
recruited by British special services, who was arrested on 15 
January this year, was a leading employee of the SMM (Special 
Engineering and Metallurgy) joint-stock company, set up on the 
basis of enterprises belonging to the former USSR Ministry of 
Defense Industry. SMM worked on state programs in the sphere of 
armor and artillery systems. This is disclosed in the Wednesday 
edition of the newspaper `Segodnya', which quotes Aleksandr 
Mikhaylov, head of the public relations centre of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service. 
  In its article on the detained agent, the newspaper says 
that 
the level of this post could illustrate the fact that he had the 
possibility of direct access to representatives of the legal 
British intelligence mission, which used the embassy as "cover." 
  The arrested person is accused of passing on top secret 
information to a foreign special service. The information 
concerned the latest armaments systems and Russia's overall 
defense potential. On 25 February he was charged under Article 
64, Sub-Section "A" (treason ... [passage indistinct]

<F P=106> [Maksim Isayev report under the "Arrest" rubric: "The </F>
Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS) Has Caught a British 
Spy. Neither the West nor Russia Intend To Scale Down 
Intelligence Activity"] 
  [Text] It has transpired from reliable sources that the 
Russian special services have marked the beginning of the 
current year by yet another successful large-scale operation, 
although this time around it was related to intelligence, not 
counterintelligence activity. 
  On 15 January, FCS officers detained a high-ranking staffer 
of a large organization in the Russian military-industrial 
sector on suspicion of spying. The name and post of this person 
have not been identified so far for the purpose of the 
investigation. 
  The Russian Main Military Prosecutor's Office has brought a 
criminal lawsuit in connection with the matter; on 25 January 
the suspect was indicted on Article 64(a) of the Russian 
Federation Criminal Code for high treason in the form of 
espionage. According to the source, the defendant has pleaded 
guilty on all counts. During the preliminary investigation, FCS 
officers managed to obtain evidence proving that the detainee 
was recruited by British special services. In order to perform 
his spy mission he was given specialized cryptographic 
equipment, instructions on methods of communicating with secret 
agents from the British Embassy in Moscow through "dead drops," 
and so forth. On instructions from the British agents he 
gathered and handed over to them secret military and economic 
information about the latest developments in the area of weapons 
models, their specifications and performance characteristics, 
the funding of defense and research-and-development programs, 
and the prospects for the organization of military- technical 
cooperation between Russia and foreign countries. 
  The investigation continues.

  [Text] Moscow March 1 TASS -- Russian nationalist leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy denied allegations that the secret weapons 
with which he had threatened the West of late was obtained by 
Russia through Aldrich Ames, a high-ranking CIA official 
arrested on charges of spying for Russia. 
  "These can be parallel research with simply the same name, 
but this is a reseach of our scientists, it has nothing to do 
with Americans", Zhirinovskiy told TASS on tuesday adding that 
he had learned about the Ames family from newspapers. 
  Media reports said that the Zhirinovskiy-disclosed secret 
weapon was created by the U.S. "Gerardo International" company, 
and, according to its President Neil Gerardo, was obtained by 
Russians through Ames. 
  "We had and have nothing to do with the Ames husband and 
wife, and we are not connected with any secret services in 
general", Zhirinovskiy said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tatyana Samolis, press secretary of the </F>
director of the Foreign Intelligence Service, by correspondent 
Sergey Omelchenko; interview is interspersed with video footage 
of Ames and his wife being arrested and Yeltsin with Clinton 
walking along surrounded by a crowd of people -- from the 
"Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Announcer] The trial in the United States of the 
case of Ames who has been charged with spying for Russia was 
expected to start today. However we have not yet received any 
news about the start of this trial. 
  [Omelchenko] In my opinion, the passions raging around 
intelligence activities have a whiff of dirty tricks about them, 
because the intelligence service in all countries, at any time, 
is as it were an early warning system warning regarding 
conflicts, the various unpleasant things that menace the state. 
And in this case, in the Ames case, don't you think, Tatyana 
Viktorevna, that this is more a matter not of professional 
problems, but of political ambitions and political problems, 
even far-fetched ones? 
  [Samolis] If this problem is raised on this level of high 
politics, then it is not raised by intelligence officers, 
because in any country professionals understand one another. 
And in general I think that in today's civilized world, 
conducting intelligence activity against one another is 
absolutely no impediment to maintaining friendly and even 
ally-style relations. 
  [Omelchenko] All that fuss surrounding the Ames affair and 
the stirring up of the public makes one form the impression that 
here, on the one hand, the CIA is in trouble in general; on the 
other hand, perhaps some kind of influential forces want to 
suggest to Clinton that he should alter relations with Russia, 
perhaps to have some kind of pause in our relations. 
  [Samolis] I would not argue with you. In any case, the 
Russian intelligence service is interested in continuing 
cooperation with the U.S. intelligence service. It will strive 
for that. 
  [Omelchenko] In what fields? 
  [Samolis] We have many common problems in this far from 
simple and rather dangerous world. First and foremost, it is in 
such fields as the problems of proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction, the fight against international crime, against drug 
trafficking, against terrorism, and the exchange of information 
on the development of the situation in crisis spots. That is 
enough for today. Tomorrow perhaps there will be some new 
problems in the solution of which we may need one another. 
  [Omelchenko] Tatyana Viktorevna, after the mutual expulsions 
of Morris and Lysenko, if there is a further escalation in such 
actions, how will the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service react? 
  [Samolis] First and foremost, we would not like this to 
happen, of course. We think that common sense should prevail, 
but if it becomes an issue like you have mentioned, then the 
measures will probably be mutual ones, but it will not be the 
intelligence service that will take them, but the country's 
highest political leadership.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] The Ames affair has taken an undesirable turn. As 
you may remember, the CIA officer Aldrich Ames was arrested in 
the United States last week on charges of spying, first for the 
former Soviet Union and then for Russia. When the official 
representative of the Russian external intelligence in Moscow, 
Aleksandr Lysenko, was declared persona non grata, Moscow took a 
retaliatory step against his American counterpart in Moscow, Mr. 
James Morris. 
  Many in Moscow keep wondering what the reason is for such a 
sharp response by the United States to the Ames case, although 
such incidents have been quite frequent in the world of 
intelligence gathering. Further to this, Mr. Ames's guilt is 
still to be proven in court and that will be no easy task. 
Also, Russia and the United States have never concluded an 
agreement to cease intelligence operations against each other. 
Moscow understands perfectly well that the United States' 
desire is to learn about what is going on in Russia, but 
Washington too must respond with understanding to Moscow's 
intention to know what trends in relations with Moscow prevail 
in United States political circles. 
  What is the real reason for the hue and cry about the Ames 
case? Observers believe that this inadequate response to events 
-- that do constitute a psychological drama for the U.S. secret 
services, no denying that -- has a political background. They 
are not ruling out that it may be linked with the success of 
Russian diplomats in their efforts to settle the Bosnian crisis. 
  On the other hand, it is quite possible that certain circles 
in the United States would prefer to make a pause in relations 
with Russia and to wait and see what turn the march of events in 
Russia will take in the near future. President Clinton seems to 
be under pressure from his political opponents, who have jumped 
at the opportunity to use the Ames affair in their own 
interests. However, the Russian side cannot help wonder why a 
problem that falls within the area of competence of United 
States and Russian security services has received a highly 
politicized interpretation. This kind of attitude disagrees 
with the principle of partnership between the Russian and United 
States intelligence services, which not only seek cooperation 
and wider contacts but already cooperate in such fields as the 
struggle against drug trafficking, terrorism, and organized 
crime. In any case, the Russian side would like that 
cooperation be continued. It hopes that if the United States is 
reserved enough, the Ames affair would remain what it should be 
-- a minor episode in relations between our two countries.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Golts article: "Why the Hysteria in Washington?"] </F>
  [Text] A certain marshal of France would say to his batman 
in the morning from time to time: "Fetch my old kepi, I intend 
to stamp on it today in a fit of anger." That is what comes to 
mind when you look at the official hysteria that has unfolded in 
the United States over the arrest of the Ames couple, who have 
been charged with spying for Russia. They have been under 
surveillance for over 10 months. The President was informed of 
all the suspicions, which did not stop him visiting Moscow and 
agreeing on a "mature partnership" with Russia. And now 
suddenly the Ameses have been dragged into broad daylight, like 
the old marshal's kepi, so that Washington has something to 
stamp on in anger. 
  One can hardly say seriously that this entire tale of 
espionage, which has caused a major cold spell in relations 
between Moscow and Washington, was the reason for this cooling. 
In actual fact, people in the U.S. capital are bound to realize 
that Russia, even if the charges against the Ameses do accord 
with reality, did not go beyond what is permissible. After all, 
as far as one can judge from articles in the press, Ames 
informed the Russian special services about U.S. agents 
operating in Russia. To be honest, Russia's desire to find out 
which of its citizens is working for a foreign state is quite 
justified. 
  But what is the real reason then for the demarches, in which 
all the administration's top leaders have been involved? To 
tell the truth I do not think that people who link what is 
happening with the ratification of this year's U.S. intelligence 
budget are right. After all, the prestige of the CIA has not so 
much been strengthened as weakened. And, what is more, given 
the really serious uncertainty in the world it is hardly 
necessary to use scandalous arrests of foreign agents to 
persuade congressmen of the need to allocate money for the 
special services' activity. 
  Those who link the hysteria in Washington with Russia's 
unexpected and extremely successful Bosnian settlement 
initiative are closer to the truth. The initiative as such is 
not the issue, however. Since, if we are talking about the crux 
of the matter, Moscow's initiative has indeed eased the 
implementation of the Western approach to the settlement. It 
has enabled the Serbs to "keep face" and NATO members to avoid 
an utterly unprecedented operation that would be the prologue to 
a long and bloody conflict. Russia has found a solution 
acceptable to everyone. Moreover it risked its soldiers' lives 
in doing so. 
  So what has driven Washington berserk? In my view, Moscow's 
successful initiative in the Balkans confirmed once and for all 
the fundamental changes in Russian foreign policy. Changes for 
which U.S. strategic planning made no provision at all. After 
all, over the last few years Washington has already gotten 
accustomed to feeling that it is the only world leader, the only 
superpower. This power could dare to ignore world public opinion 
when missile and bombing raids were inflicted on Iraq. It can 
even put up with the obvious fiasco of Somalia. And its world 
lead does not seem to have been disputed at all. At least no 
alternatives were given. 
  But this time the United States found itself on the 
sidelines 
of the settlement process owing to the actions taken by Russia, 
which it had long since struck off the list of main participants 
in international politics. But no, in everyone's eyes Russia 
remained an important, perhaps the most important factor in 
world politics. A passive inward-looking factor, so to speak. 
Russia was primarily of interest to the rest of the world 
because of the dangers that will arise if disturbances or civil 
war break out in a country that not only has nuclear but also 
other destructive potential. And so, in order not to "cause 
trouble," the West, primarily the United States, was willing to 
provide some financial and economic aid for Russian reforms and 
mostly talk endlessly about the terms of this support. With the 
same end in view -- in order not to elicit a pathological 
reaction from the Russian public -- our country continued to be 
ritually called a great power and invited to take part in 
resolving various global problems, without being thought capable 
of really accomplishing anything. 
  People say that fashion reflects people's ideas. Thus, 
"Russian refugee" style is gaining a foothold in the world: 
shapeless pants, a vest, and a shawl worn on top of a sweater 
with the ends tied at the back. Like it or not, that is how we 
are seen. Yet suddenly it emerges that Russia, which had 
already been written off, is beginning not only to announce but 
also to implement an active foreign policy course. It is not 
enough that it is resolutely promoting reintegration within the 
CIS and trying to carry out peacekeeping functions in nearby 
foreign countries. The West could have somehow put up with that. 
But a country in crisis is being successful in an area where 
Western states have been impotently marking time for two years 
now. It emerges that, despite its own crisis and the 
occasionally obvious inconsistency in its policy, Russia still 
has considerable prestige, and quite possibly not just in the 
Balkans.... 
  The question now is, as France's LE FIGARO wrote, how far 
the 
United States is prepared to agree to the expansion of Russian 
influence. At the moment Washington is displaying its 
irritation. 
  Someone has been very skillful and timely in bringing up the 
Ameses. After all, the incident is extremely useful for those 
circles that have no interest in a real partnership between the 
West and Russia. And these circles exist in virtually all 
countries. MAINICHI SHIMBUN has just reported that 
U.S.-Japanese staff exercises are still being conducted, based 
on the possibility of a Russian attack on Hokkaido. Now, when 
the sides are reassessing their own role and the role of 
partner, those people who feel uncomfortable in the present 
situation may quite easily see their chance. They could quite 
easily try to use the cold spell to once again dig up the "enemy 
image" that we are long since sick of. 
  Yet one cannot say that their plans are totally groundless. 
The train of events shows that the switch to new relations with 
the West has by no means become irreversible. The old fears and 
old ways rear their heads again at the slightest complication. 
And menacing speeches can already be heard in the U.S. 
Congress. A Russian diplomat has already been expelled like 
during those memorable times. And this at a time when the U.S. 
President has over the last few days clearly been backpedaling, 
reluctant to jeopardize the whole set of Russian-U.S. relations. 
However the conflict seems to have the potential to escalate on 
its own. 
  A great deal now depends on Russia. It must retain calm 
dignity. One can hardly talk seriously about its meeting the 
absolutely unacceptable demand for the unilateral cessation of 
intelligence activity in the United States. But it is also 
important not to succumb to provocation today. We are by and 
large being incited to make brusque statements. Firmness is 
what is needed here. It is necessary to show the United States 
and other Western states from the example of recent crises that 
a partnership with Russia is indeed a vital necessity for 
everyone. And that the rules of conduct within this partnership 
are the same for everyone. That there are not junior partners 
who must know their place and not interfere in the adults' 
conversations and actions. Nor are there any older partners who 
have the right to put children in their place or even just vent 
their spleen on them.

<F P=106> [Anatoliy Shapovalov "Commentary": "Russia-United States: </F>
Time To Call a Time-Out?"] 
  [Text] At first glance, the "case" of Mr. and Mrs. Ames, 
who allegedly worked first for the Soviet Union and then for 
Russia, is taking a sinister turn. Panic even has begun to 
loom: A rupture in American-Russian relations is said to be 
inevitable. 
  The development of events has indeed taken a dangerous turn. 
James Morrris, counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow (he is a 
representative of the CIA, don't be surprised -- Moscow and 
Washington have reached an accord whereby they don't keep secret 
who the chief representatives of their special services are) has 
been officially declared persona non grata. 
  But why actually has such a furor been created? Have Russia 
and the United States really reached an accord that the two 
sides stop intelligence activity? Nothing of the kind. 
Moreover, the calls to intensify such activity in relation to 
Russia and to give it priority status are growing in Congress. 
Nor does the Russian Federation Foreign Intelligence Service 
[FIS] hide the fact that it too is engaged in such work -- not 
with the aim of undermining the United States (the political 
intelligence service is scarcely up to that) but out of a desire 
to learn what the trends are on the banks of the Potomac, who 
wants Russia to fall apart and who wants it to remain intact, 
and who is trying to play the Ukrainian or other cards. For its 
part, the United States takes an interest in what is being done 
in our country and which parties and forces are seeking power. 
  The Americans advance the argument that the Ames' presence 
in 
the CIA has undermined U.S. security. Excuse me, but, given 
that Aldrich was recruiting agents in Russia, whose security is 
actually at stake here? 
  However, once the "case" of the Ames couple had blown up it 
immediately began to retreat into the background. Something 
quite different began to predominate. Unhappy that Russia had 
taken the initiative in resolving the Bosnian crisis, some 
people began grumbling: Look, the Russian bear is awaking 
again. At the same time a broad hint was dropped: The United 
States is a country which has not just special commitments but 
also special rights in the world. And Russia meanwhile should 
not conduct intelligence activity in the States, it should not 
engage in intelligence at all. In general, as you can see, we 
have back-to-front logic here. True, you do also hear in the 
United States the voices of people like, for example, ex-CIA 
Director William Colby, who take a realistic and sensible line. 
But the problem is that they are immediately put down for 
allegedly acting unpatriotically. 
  Clearly, the position of those people in the United States 
ready to blame the Clinton administration for having recklessly 
and naively expanded relations with Russia is strengthening. 
Now the "case" of the Ames couple has become known it is 
necessary to correct the mistakes made, that is to say, call a 
time-out in relations with Russia. It is essential to take a 
closer look at what is happening over there. 
  Being gentlemen, Russian intelligence officers appreciate 
that the CIA (professional solidarity is no doubt in play here) 
is now experiencing a psychological trauma, being under strong 
pressure from the FBI, the legislative bodies, and, finally, the 
taxpayers (we pay our money in and it then ends up in the 
pockets of traitors). Preserving a sense of tact, CIA Director 
James Woolsey is seeking not to fuel the situation. But certain 
circles in the United States are very persistent and are 
inclined perhaps to revive elements characteristic of the period 
of confrontation and to shift purely professional questions (the 
questions of the special services) into the sphere of state 
relations. 
  The Russian FIS rejects any gloating whatsoever over the 
situation in which CIA staffers find themselves and is ready to 
engage in dialogue and discussion on these painful issues. It 
is no secret that there is a lot the Americans don't like about 
current practice, but their Russian counterparts have their own 
complaints too. It is well known, in particular, that the 
bugging of Russian Federation representatives has not stopped. 
V. Bakatin handed over important documents to the American 
side, but nothing has been received in return to date. The 
intensive recruiting of Russian citizens by the U.S. special 
services also disturbs Moscow. 
  In short, both the Russian FIS and the CIA favor 
cooperation, 
but cooperation with necessary consideration of national 
interests. They favor cooperation on an equal footing. This 
has to be a two-way street. Any other approach is tantamount to 
requiring the other side to surrender its position while 
allegedly on a level playing field.

  [Text] Moscow March 1 TASS -- An agreement to unblock the 
Tuzla airport with participation of international observers and 
strict control over the delivery of humanitarian cargo is a new 
major step towards political settlement in Bosnia, Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told correspondents here today 
upon the completion his negotiations with Bosnian Serb Leader 
Radovan Karadzic. 
  Karadzic came to Moscow on Monday night [28 February] on the 
Russian initiative for negotiations on Bosnian settlement. 
  The negotiations were very frank but difficult as the 
problem 
is complicated and the war has lasted for two years, said 
Kozyrev. In his opinion, the peace initiative of Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin has played an exclusively positive role 
in settlement around Sarajevo as "it created conditions for a 
crucial turn in regional developments". 
  Kozyrev plans to discuss with Boris Yeltsin the Russian 
holding of operation at the Tuzla airport. He said the 
agreement to the effect reached with the Serb side opens way to 
more steps for regional settlement. Kozyrev hopes other states 
will participate in negotiations with other parties to the 
conflict in order to reach accord and compromises. 
  In his turn, Karadzic praised Yeltsin's initiative as a good 
sign for other sides to follow the path of peaceful settlement. 
He said Bosnian Serbs agree to open the Tuzla airport in the 
immediate future for the delivery of humanitarian cargo. They 
also want Russian observers to control non-military uses of the 
airport, which, in the words of Karadzic, correspond to wishes 
of representatives of the U.N. secretary-general and the 
European Union in former Yugoslavia. 
  A statement for the press issued by the sides notes that the 
arrival of Russian peace-makers in the area of Sarajevo and 
precise and objective fulfilment of their duty as part of the 
U.N. Protection Force in former Yugoslavia are a weighty and 
stabilizing contribution that creates prerequisites for 
normalization in Sarajevo and around it. 
  The Bosnian Serb leader welcomed the Russian president's 
initiative to hold a summit in Moscow in order to reach the 
soonest peace agreement, settle crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
and lift sanctions against former Yugoslavia. 
  When discussing the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the 
Russian side stressed the need for maximum restraint and full 
cooperation with the U.N., says the statement.

  [Text] Moscow March 2 ITAR-TASS -- Bosnian Serb Leader 
Radovan Karadzic told a news conference here today that the 
United Nations should play a more prominent role in the Bosnian 
peace process and objected to the U.S. attempts to monopolize 
the process. "I do not think that one country should monopolize" 
this process and sideline all others, Karadzic said. 
  Karadzic sounded apprehensive about the confederation pact 
between Bosnia's Croats and Moslems agreed in Washington, and 
said he feared it could be used against Serbs in the former 
yugoslav republic. "We can welcome this agreement only if it is 
not aimed against Serbs, only if it lead us to peace and not to 
war".

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>
  [Text] A spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry has 
told Interfax, the leader of Bosnian Serbs Radovan Karadzic who 
Tuesday met in Moscow with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev, has welcomed the initiative by Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin on holding in Moscow a summit meeting (4+1 -- Interfax) 
to reach as early as possible an understanding on peace, 
comprehensive settlement of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
the lifting of sanctions from the new Yugoslavia. 
  Answering the wish by the Russian president, Karadzic said 
that during the preparation for the meeting Bosnian Serbs will 
show a maximum of contructiveness, with due account of the 
quality criteria for the territorial delineation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Karadzic voiced gratitude for the decisive actions of the 
Russian president for the political settlement of the crisis 
around Sarajevo. 
  Kozyrev and Karadzic have said that arrival of a Russian 
peace- keeping contingent in Sarajevo, the strict performance of 
its duty as part of the UN Protection Force are a weighty and 
stabilizing contribution creating prerequisites for further 
progress in normalising the situation in the city and around it. 
  Karadzic said that the Bosnian Serbs agree to the opening of 
an airport in the city of Tuzla that will welcome deliveries of 
humanitarian cargoes. Bosnian Serbs proceed from the fact that 
Russian observers will take an active part in the control over 
the non-military use of the airport. This goes in line with the 
desire of the envoy of the UN Secretary General on the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  For its part, the Russian side said about preparedness to 
send its observers to Tuzla. [sentence as received] 
  During the discussion of the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
the Russian side pointed to the need to show the maximal 
restraint and cooperation with the UN Protection Force. This 
was welcomed by Karadzic and other leaders of the Bosnian Serbs. 
<H5>  "NATO ACTION NO ACCIDENT," RUSSIAN DEFENSE OFFICIAL SAYS </H5>
  The shooting down of four, presumably Serbian, planes by 
NATO 
air force was "no accident," a senior official in the Russian 
Defense Ministry told Interfax. 
  He said that "the Americans who have long since sided with 
the Muslims always wanted to put pressure to bear on Bosnian 
Serbs. The UN 'no-flight zone' resolution was passed more than 
a year ago but never applied until now even though it had been 
repeatedly violated by Bosnian Serbs, Muslims and Croatians." 
  The official said that the NATO action in which USAF jets 
were involved was directed less against Bosnian Serbs than 
against Russia which had scored significant successes "along the 
Yugoslav line." He believed that "the noise over the Ames' case 
was consistent with the action in Bosnia. Americans do whatever 
they want and behave as if they won the cold war." 
  On the other hand, he did not want to make the U.S. more 
guilty than it was. "There was no evil design in letting the 
planes drop their bombs before shooting them down. In 
Bosnia-Herzegovina where the positions of the warring parties 
tend to 'intertwine' it takes just minutes from the take off to 
the start of bombing," he said.

  [Text] Moscow, March 1 (TANJUG) -- Speaker of the Russian 
Parliament Lower House Ivan Rybkin criticized Tuesday the action 
of NATO planes over Bosnia-Herzegovina and set out that 'NATO 
cannot be an instrument of the United Nations.' 
  Rybkin told a press conference that the actions of the 
international community could not be undertaken by-passing 
Russia. In this, he added, I agree with President Boris Yeltsin. 
  NATO has said Monday that its F-16 U.S. planes downed early 
on Monday four Galeb type aircraft near Banja Luka, a city in 
northwestern Bosnia-Herzegovina, which were found in violation 
of the no-fly zone over Bosnia. The identity of the downed 
planes has not been established, but the world media hurried to 
claim they belonged to the Bosnian Serbs. 
  The authorities of the Bosnian Serbs denied these claims, 
while Maj. Obaydul, who heads the UNPROFOR monitor mission at 
the Banja Luka airport, the only airport the Bosnian Serb army 
has, said Tuesday his team already sent to the main headquarters 
three reports that there were no take-offs nor landings at the 
airport, not only at the time the planes were downed but also 
over the past few days in general. 
  The NATO action was criticized Tuesday in a statement to the 
INTERFAX news agency also by a ranking Russian Defense Ministry 
official. He assessed that this action was not only directed at 
the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina but even more so against Russia, 
and all this because it has of late achieved much success in 
pacifying the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. 
  'The Americans have no wish to talk and behave as if the 
cold 
war has ended with their victory,' an unnamed Russian official 
told the agency.

<F P=106> [Report by Colonel Aleksandr Oliynik and Major Sergey </F>
Sidorov: "Russia Takes Active Role in Settling Balkan Crisis. 
Press Conference at Russian Defense Ministry"] 
  [Text] Russia's sensational political initiative in the 
Balkans and the role that our Airborne Troops in the UN 
peacekeeping forces played therein were discussed at a press 
conference for Russian and foreign correspondents given 26 
February by Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the 
Russian Armed Forces General Staff, and Colonel General Yevgeniy 
Podkolzin, commander of the Airborne Troops. 
  From the moment that NATO presented the warring parties in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina with an ultimatum, the Russian leadership has 
taken a firm and unequivocal stance, Col. Gen. Mikhail 
Kolesnikov told journalists, namely that a solution to the 
Bosnian problem must be sought by peaceful, political means. 
That is why, he went on to say, not only would the intended 
aerial bombing of Serb positions not speed up the peace 
settlement process but it might on the contrary stiffen the 
sides' positions and lead to a fresh escalation of the war in 
the Balkans. 
  The chief of the General Staff stressed that, by threatening 
to carry out bombing raids on targets around Sarajevo, the NATO 
command has thus put itself in an ambiguous position. It has 
been publicly stated that the use of force should be the 
instrument that will enable the situation around Sarajevo to be 
normalized. In actual fact Western diplomats acknowledge that 
bombing would be regarded in the North Atlantic Alliance as the 
collapse of its strong-arm policy. That is why the alliance 
greeted with relief the news that, owing to the efforts of the 
Russian president and Russian diplomats, it had proved possible 
to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy arms from 
a 20-km zone around Sarajevo, while our "blue helmets" in the UN 
peacekeeping forces acted as guarantors of this plan's 
implementation. 
  The arrival of the Russian soldiers is a key element in the 
implementation of Russia's plan for a political settlement of 
the crisis in Bosnia, Col. Gen. Kolesnikov noted. No matter 
what people in the West are now saying about the fear that the 
NATO ultimatum has supposedly inspired in the Serbs, he said, 
trust played a crucial role in the Serbs accepting our 
proposals. "The trust which they have in Russia and its 
peacekeeping forces." 
  The chief of the Armed Forces General Staff told journalists 
that, in response to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's 
proposals, the Russian president asked the Federation Council to 
agree to allocate an additional troop contingent of 300 men to 
participate in the UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The upper 
chamber of parliament took a positive view of this proposal 25 
February. What is more, Col. Gen. Kolesnikov pointed out, the 
Federation Council instructed the country's government on the 
Russian Defense Ministry's submission to urgently resolve the 
question of a pay raise for the personnel of the Russian UN 
contingent in Yugoslavia. The Russian Defense Ministry in 
conjunction with the Russian Foreign Ministry has also been 
tasked with immediately formulating a system of social 
guarantees for the personnel of the "blue berets" involved in 
peacekeeping operations on Yugoslav territory. 
  Col. Gen. Kolesnikov said in conclusion that Russia is 
starting to play a more active, autonomous role in settling the 
crisis in the Balkans, bolstering its diplomatic efforts by 
making a specific military and peacekeeping contribution. The 
statements, initiatives, and actions by the Russian political 
and military leadership and diplomats have once again proved 
that it is not strong-arm but political means of settling the 
Yugoslav conflict that are inexhaustible. And we will try to 
stick to them in the future. 
  Col. Gen. Yevgeniy Podkolzin, commander of the Airborne 
Troops, who returned from Belgrade 24 February as part of a 
government delegation, told journalists how Russia's proposed 
plan for settling the Bosnian crisis is being implemented. A 
key element in this plan was for Russian "blue helmets" to come 
to Sarajevo within a limited period. Despite the mountainous 
locality and the sudden snowfall, Col. Gen. Podkolzin said, a 
convoy of combat hardware with 400 Russian Airborne Troops led 
by Colonel Viktor Vorobyev arrived in Bosnia precisely on 
schedule. The local population -- not only the Serbs, but also 
the Croats and Muslims -- gave our Airborne Troops a cordial, 
enthusiastic reception like the frontline soldiers in victorious 
1945. 
  At present, journalists were told by the commander of the 
Airborne Troops, our "blue helmets" are performing a 
peacekeeping mission in the Bosnian capital's so-called buffer 
zone between the opposing sides -- the Serbs and Muslims -- they 
occupy 16 km of the front. They have also taken Sarajevo 
Airport under guard along with the French "blue helmets." 
  With regard to the plan for our Airborne Troops' future stay 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Col. Gen. Podkolzin pointed out that they 
form the backbone of the UN 2d Russian battalion, which will be 
stationed in the Sarajevo region. As for the additional 
contingent of 300 men, whose posting to Bosnia-Herzegovina has 
been approved by the Federation Council, it will be sent in 
mid-March. Thus, the total number of Russian "blue helmets" on 
Yugoslav territory will shortly reach 1,500 officers, warrant 
officers, and contract troops, which, according to the commander 
of the Airborne Troops, will also help boost Russia's 
peacekeeping efforts in the Balkans. 
  In response to your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent's question 
regarding guarantees of our soldiers' safety in Bosnia, where 
the 100,000-strong Muslim Army includes around 10,000 mojahedin 
who fought in Afghanistan, the commander of the Airborne Troops 
said that this was the main topic of conversation during his 
meeting with British General Rose, commander of the UN forces in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, who gave assurances that all steps are 
currently being taken to ensure the safety of the "blue helmet" 
contingent, including the Russians. 
  Other questions from journalists were also answered during 
the press conference.

<F P=106> [Interview with First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy </F>
Adamishin by Luisa Meireles by telephone; date not given] 
  [Text] First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin is 
regarded as the "brains" behind the current Russian initiative 
in Bosnia. Responsible for the main guidelines of foreign 
policy, he spoke to EXPRESSO by telephone. 
  [Meireles] Following a period of apparent self-effacement 
with respect to the Balkans, Russia has taken up active 
involvement. Why? 
  [Adamishin] Russia has not begun to act just now. We have 
been seeking for months a political agreement for Bosnia and for 
other conflict areas in the former Yugoslavia. At the last UN 
session we proposed the demilitarization of Sarajevo, and 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev suggested 24 January a 
ministerial meeting with the Security Council members in order 
to examine the city's problems, demilitarization, and placement 
under UN administration. The NATO ultimatum prevented the 
completion of the process. The political and diplomatic actions 
were the culmination of many months of efforts by Russian 
diplomacy. 
  [Meireles] But it was the credible threat of the use of 
force which produced the first positive results.... 
  [Adamishin] I would say that it was the nonuse of force 
which made possible this result. I am not certain that the 
Serbs would have withdrawn their weapons if Russia had not asked 
them to do so in accordance with the UN secretary general's 
plan, without our resorting to ultimatums or threats. The 
important thing is the results, not the laurels, but if anybody 
says that the decisive role was played by NATO, I disagree, and 
if NATO had shelled the Serb positions, I do not know what the 
consequences would have been. 
  [Meireles] Did the West try to sideline Russia in resolving 
the conflict? 
  [Adamishin] We did not like this ultimatum. In the first 
place, because it is not for NATO to deliver ultimatums and 
threaten the use of force in international relations, which is 
exclusively the Security Council's responsibility. Second, we 
agree with the West on the demilitarization of Sarajevo and its 
administration by the United Nations, and the overall political 
agreement, but the method chosen by the West would place Russia 
outside the decisionmaking framework, and here we disagree. 
Third, we believe that it prevented -- or at least did not 
facilitate -- the continuation of the negotiations which were 
already taking place in Sarajevo between Serbs and Muslims and 
which were suspended by the latter in anticipation of an 
intervention. The Muslims are the greatest obstacle to an 
agreement right now because they still hope to achieve on the 
battlefield what they could secure at the negotiating table, and 
when they learned that somebody was prepared to wage war for 
them, they lost interest in the talks. 
  [Meireles] When you said that Russia had carried out its 
task and that it is now for the West to perform its own, were 
you referring to the exertion of pressure on the Muslims? 
  [Adamishin] What I mean is that we used a powerful argument 
-- our influence on the Serbs. Nobody else would have it. It 
stems from our balanced policy with respect to the crisis, not 
from our belonging to the same ethnic and religious group. We 
do not seek to vindicate the Serbs, but we do not regard them as 
the sole culprits. It is known that the United States or some 
other countries have greater prospects of influencing the 
Muslims and making them see that it is time to sit down at the 
negotiating table and achieve peace by accepting the plan for a 
political agreement which was virtually approved by the three 
sides and was withdrawn from the negotiating table. 
  [Meireles] In the talks with the United States, did Moscow 
inform it of that viewpoint? 
  [Adamishin] We must all work together to influence the three 
sides, using everybody's assets. The Americans told us not to 
pressure the Muslims yet deemed themselves to be in a position 
to tell us to pressure the Serbs. They did not wish to impose 
conditions on the Muslims for an agreement -- only on the Serbs. 
This is not a fair stance. 
  [Meireles] In Moscow, all the political forces have 
supported the initiative in Bosnia. Does the Slav-Orthodox 
alliance remain valid? 
  [Adamishin] Our historical ties with the Serbs are one of 
the factors, but it is very dangerous to see the conflict in 
ethnic and religious terms: If the Slav countries supported the 
Serbs, the Islamic countries would have to support the Muslims, 
and the Catholics would have to support the Croats. It is not 
correct to say that only the Serbs are to blame, because it is 
untrue and politically incorrect. 
  [Meireles] Do you believe that the West has made that 
mistake? 
  [Adamishin] That is not what I mean. It is not possible to 
be unaware that Islamic countries are intervening for religious 
reasons. The important thing is to end the conflict, but an 
external act of force does not facilitate an agreement. We do 
not reject the possibility of its being necessary to use force 
-- such as, for instance, the UN forces having the right to 
defend themselves in the event of an attack -- but these are 
very specific and limited cases. 
  [Meireles] Could the model applied in Sarajevo be used in 
other Bosnian cities? 
  [Adamishin] Another ultimatum? Let them try it, and maybe 
they will reach the conclusion that it does not work! If one of 
the sides believes that it is possible the other will be 
attacked, there ceases to be a need to negotiate. 
  [Meireles] What are Russia's means for resolving the 
conflict? 
  [Adamishin] In the first place, we have political influence; 
second, we are prepared to work with all the Western countries; 
third, we have our troops there. They are under UN command, 
integrated into the peacekeeping forces, and this participation 
gives us greater ability to influence decisions. 
  [Meireles] Are you in favor of U.S. troops' participation in 
the UN Protection Force? 
  [Adamishin] Why not? We are inviting them! 
  [Meireles] Have you asked President Clinton? 
  [Adamishin] President Clinton has always said that he does 
not wish to send U.S. troops to Bosnia. It is not for us to 
tell him to send them. It is the United Nations which should 
say which troops it needs in Bosnia. When Butrus-Ghali said 
that he needed more forces in Sarajevo, we responded to his 
request. 
  [Meireles] If the ultimatum were carried out, could a grave 
conflict develop between East and West? 
  [Adamishin] That is a hypothetical question. Let us keep 
our fingers crossed and be thankful that this has not happened, 
and let us all be more sensible in the future in order to avert 
that possibility.

  [Text] Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres Tuesday [1 
March] had a telephone talk with his Russian counterpart Andrey 
Kozyrev and informed him of the measures taken by Tel Aviv for 
strengthening the security of the Palestinians and the order on 
the occupied territories following the tragedy in Hebron, 
Interfax was told by the spokesman for the Russian Foreign 
Ministry Grigoriy Karasin. 
  He said that in response to the earlier request by the 
Russian Minister, Peres voiced consent to discuss the proposals 
by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat about the international presence 
to help solve the problem. 
  It was said that the joint search for ways to overcome the 
current crisis would be continued. In line with it, the special 
envoy of the Russian President, First Deputy Russian Foreign 
Minister Igor Ivanov will leave for Israel after the talks with 
the Palestinian leadership in Tunisia. 
  The explosion on Sunday in a Catholic Church in the suburbs 
of Beirut indicates that the extremist forces in the region do 
not give up attempts to frustrate the national reconciliation in 
Lebanon and block the Middle East peace process, Grigoriy 
Karasin has told Interfax. 
  He said that following the criminal act in Hebron, where an 
Israeli fanatic shot at believers at a mosque, another tragedy 
came. As a result of an explosion during the Sunday mass, dozens 
of civilian Lebanese were killed or wounded. 
  Russia expresses deep condolences to the families of the 
victims, said Karasin. 
  He said that the new tide of violence in the Middle East 
must 
be stopped and the region and its future must be protected 
against the encroachments of extremists.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev by </F>
unidentified interviewer; place and date not given; from the 
"Middle East Drama" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Interviewer] Andrey Vladimirovich, what's your 
assessment of the tragic event that occurred in Hebron? 
  [Kozyrev] It is, in general, quite a typical situation. In 
many areas of conflict, we encounter provocations -- either the 
actions of people who cannot cope with their hatred, or simply 
madmen, etc. In other words, the situation is, in general, 
familiar enough from other areas. A person fires and kills 
dozens of people. That immediately highlights a problem. The 
main problem is the safety of the population in the occupied 
territories and, of course, potentially, in those territories 
that are now, by agreement, to be handed over to the Palestinian 
side. Safety has to be ensured there too, and, of course, it is 
a very sensitive moment when, on the one hand, peace is already 
attainable, but, on the other, forces are at work -- perhaps 
it's an individual in the present case, but behind him, 
objectively, stand forces, anyway -- that wish to frustrate the 
peace. That is the essence of the tragedy. 
  What conclusion can be drawn from this? Some may conclude 
that nothing will come of it. So let us fight, kill, and return 
to what is essentially a war in these territories. The second 
conclusion, which we draw, is that it is necessary to help the 
sides, to help them more actively. That is what, in our view, 
this occurrence has highlighted -- apart from the human tragedy. 
  So, acting on the president's instructions, I immediately 
made contact with 'Arafat and with Shim'on Peres this morning. 
He and I had a further talk later. The Israelis assured us 
that they would be adopting their own measures to ensure 
security. In fact, Peres told me today that the government has 
adopted a whole package of measures -- five or six of them -- 
including the disarming of the most dangerous elements who are 
there among the Israelis themselves. That is, I think, a strong 
and, to be honest, a bold step on the part of the Israeli 
Government, and they had voiced their indignation, and so on and 
so forth. In other words, something is being done. 
  We also discussed the possibility of further measures of 
that 
type. 'Arafat asked me to go back to the idea of international 
participation, international assistance. Indeed, our experience 
in other areas too also shows that, generally speaking, either 
Russian or UN observers provide assistance, if only 
psychological. In other words, the sides see that someone is 
helping, that they are not cast to the mercy of fate. 
  There is a very high level of suspicion on both sides, and 
the presence of international representatives does somehow give 
them a feeling of -- how should I put it? -- neutrality or 
greater confidence. I asked the Israeli Government to weigh up 
the possibility of such an international presence. At first, 
the reaction was not very, let us say, it was without 
enthusiasm. Why? Because they don't want a UN presence. We 
then suggested that some thought could be given to the idea that 
they did not need to be UN observers. Maybe it would, in the 
end, be necessary to look for some other uniforms. 
  Shim'on Peres, Israel's foreign minister, told me on the 
telephone today that they are really prepared to discuss 
different options. They are still somewhat wary of the United 
Nations but he did not rule out other options. So we have 
agreed that Igor Sergeyevich Ivanov, the special envoy of the 
president and the first deputy foreign minister, who is a very 
experienced diplomat -- he has today flown to Tunisia to have a 
meeting with 'Arafat and the PLO leaders and to discuss with 
them ways out of this situation and how Russia can help -- we 
are ready to consider some material, and not merely political 
forms of assistance to the Palestinians, so that they might 
start feeling more confident, but immediately after this, in 
accordance with the understanding I have just reached, he will 
fly to Israel where he is to have a meeting with Israeli leaders 
in order to discuss different solutions with them as well. 
  Thus, the important thing is to provide for both sides a 
maximum political, and if necessary, material assistance, if you 
like, so that they can not only rescue the peace process but 
could also move onwards after this shock, this tragedy. This is 
because we want peace to prevail in the Middle East, and we 
cannot allow a bandit, or even a group of bandits, to disrupt 
this process. However, it is one thing to reach an agreement in 
principle and to start implementing it -- talks on the 
implementation of the agreement are under way -- but then 
immediately we are confronted with reality. And here other 
forces emerge, which try to disrupt this process, if you see 
what I mean. And it turns out that the whole thing requires 
much greater efforts that we probably thought at the beginning. 
Therefore, we have rushed to fill this breach, in order to save 
this peace process once again and even to impart a new impetus 
to it. 
  I think it will take our special envoy several days to 
establish various other contacts. I spoke to U.S. Secretary of 
State Christopher about this yesterday. Russia and the United 
States are the cosponsors of the peace process in the Middle 
East, and we are not saying no to cooperation in this sphere, 
but it is clear that without an active Russian participation -- 
both 'Arafat and the Israeli leaders have asked for that -- this 
process cannot be saved. But we are not saying that this is 
something different from the efforts of everyone else. On the 
contrary, we think that everyone should be working to achieve 
the same goal.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Russian Foreign Ministry today issued a 
statement on the persisting tensions in the occupied territories 
of Palestine. This alarming situation calls for active steps on 
the part of Russia. The statement says Russia believes it 
necessary for the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution with 
a view to ensure security in that region of the world. The idea 
of international protection for civilians merits the most 
serious consideration; this protection could be carried out by 
independent observers on the West bank of the river Jordan and 
in the Gaza strip. 
  A new international impetus is needed for the cause of 
reconciliation between the Arabs and the Israelis to proceed 
further. Russia proposes that a second plenary meeting of the 
Madrid conference on the Middle East at the foreign minister 
level should be arranged. Moscow also favors the continuation 
of bilateral talks at any venue convenient for those taking part. 
  This was a statement from the foreign ministry of the 
Russian 
Federation.

  [Text] Russia is in favor of adoption of an UN Security 
Council resolution to provide for security on the Arab 
territories occupied by Israel, says a statement of Russian 
Foreign Ministry's spokesman handed over to INTERFAX Wednesday. 
  The problematic situation on the occupied Palestinian 
territories, the result of the barbaric crime of an Israeli 
extremist in Hebron, encourages Russia to make further active 
moves in order to overcome the present crisis phase in the peace 
process in the Middle East -- which appear under threat, the 
statement says. 
  The document also points out that Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev maintains permanent contact with the Palestinian 
and Israeli leadership to look for optimal forms of Russian 
assistance for the sake of returning to a peaceful settlement. 
Russia's first deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov was sent to 
the Middle East on the private instruction of the Russian 
president to meet with the PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and 
Israeli leadership. 
  Moscow believes that the idea of sending international 
supervisors to the West Bank of the Jordan River and Gaza Strip 
"deserves serious attention." "This would facilitate bringing 
about Palestinian self-management there," says the statement. 
  The new "obstacle" in the Middle Eastern talks demonstrates 
that there is a need for "a new international impulse" to 
reconcile the Arabs and Israelis. Another plenary meeting of 
the Madrid conference on the Middle East, on the level of 
Foreign Ministers, could become such an impetus, believes Moscow. 
  Speaking about the nearest prospects, the statement says 
that 
Russia advocates continuation of bilateral negotiations to be 
conducted in places convenient for their participants.

<F P=106> [Commentary by commentator Aleksandr Timoshkin entitled The </F>
Arab-Israeli Talks Should Continue; read by announcer] 
  [Text] The Middle East peace conference co-sponsors, Russia 
and the United States, think it indispensable to continue these 
talks. Moscow has sent the deputy foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, 
on a special mission to the Middle East. The aim of of the 
visit, during which Ivanov will meet President Yasir 'Arafat, is 
to give the peace process in the region a fresh impetus. Russia 
continues to stimulate mediation efforts aimed at ensuring the 
success of the Arab-Israeli direct talks. Moscow has agreed to 
Washington's proposal of sending out an invitation to the 
negotiating parties to resume the talks in the U.S. capital. 
  After meeting the Palestinian president in Tunis, Ivanov 
will 
go to Israel to hold talks with officials there. In the light 
of these talks, Moscow will decide its subsequent steps in its 
Middle East foreign policy. 
  This is what Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
announced at a news conference yesterday. He had a phone 
conversation with his Israeli counterpart, Shimon Peres, who 
informed Kozyrev of Israel's agreement to allow foreign civilian 
observers to visit the Palestinian occupied territories. In the 
meantime the Israeli Government is taking some measures to 
reduce the gravity of the negative impact of the Hebron massacre 
on the talks process. For example, the release has started 
today of hundreds of Palestinians from prisons, and the policy 
of limiting contacts between Jewish settlers and the 
Palestinians to avoid new bloody clashes continues. 
  Representatives of the PLO in the occupied territories think 
that the release of a few hundred Palestinian prisoners is not 
enough, because the heart of the matter is the release of all 
the 10,000 prisoners. 
  On its part, the United States was busy coordinating with 
the 
Palestinians and Israelis on the Security Council draft 
resolution, the main aim of which is to put an end to the bloody 
acts of violence exchanged in the Palestinian occupied 
territories. 
  The U.S. permanent representative at the UN said that the 
agreement on the text of the document [UN Security Council 
resolution] is being finalized word by word to avoid a different 
interpretation in the future. 
  The Security Council will continue discussing the 
consequences of the Hebron massacre today. Representatives of 
more than 30 UN member states have asked to address the session. 
Therefore, it is possible that the Security Council's meetings 
could last several days. 
  The current circumstances indicate that the international 
community is concerned that the Middle East peace process should 
continue until a just and lasting peace has been established in 
the region, and until a secure and peaceful situation has 
developed for all the peoples and states of the region. 
  Obsessed extremist terrorists from both sides must never be 
allowed to hinder or stop the progress of the negotiating 
process, the final aim if which is to reconcile between Israelis 
and Arabs on a basis acceptable equally to them and to the 
international community.

<F P=106> [Leonid Mlechin article: "In the Near East One Madman May </F>
Destroy What the Leaders of Several States Have Built With 
Difficulty"] 
  [Excerpts] The massacre in the mosque which one madman 
carried out will cost the Jewish state dear. Terrorist 
reprisals are simply the most obvious of troubles which may 
occur. 
  The positions of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and his 
entourage, which took the risk of recognizing Israel's right to 
exist despite being cursed by many Palestinians who are sure 
that the only way to resolve all their problems is to cast the 
Jews into the sea, have been weakened. 
  The Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories which 
began after the bloodshed in the mosque on Friday is terrifying 
the Israelis. Neither negotiations with the Palestinian Arabs 
nor peace with them -- only force of arms --- seems to be a 
guarantee of their security. In looking for protection, the 
Israelis are turning to right-wing parties, opponents of the 
negotiations with 'Arafat and of the return of the occupied 
territories to the Arabs. Yitzhaq Rabin's government may lose 
its support. 
  Israelis are full of doubt about peace negotiations with the 
Arabs because it is the Jews who must make all the real 
concessions (including returning the territories). The Arabs, 
on the other hand, are being asked for something metaphysical -- 
to recognize Israel and conclude peace with it. But a treaty is 
not a docket for a purchase. It can be dissolved, then it is no 
longer possible to return land. To the Israelis this exchange 
-- taking into account the Arabs' hatred toward the Jewish state 
-- seems to be unequal and unreliable. But the Israelis have no 
choice. [passage omitted] 
  The only correct response by Israel to the massacre in the 
mosque is to accelerate talks with the PLO and grant the 
Palestinian Arabs autonomy as soon as possible. Otherwise, 
Israel will have an uncertain and lonely future which is 
dependent on a narrowing circle of friends.

  [Text] Moscow March 2 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin and Uzbekistan's Islam Karimov have signed "the 
declaration about the development and deepening of comprehensive

  The declaration signed in the Kremlin today says that the 
Russian Federation and the Republic of Uzbekistan confirm the 
determination to consistently develop and deepen comprehensive 
cooperation in the interests of the peoples of both states and 
pursue the policy of economic reforms and democratic 
transformations". [no opening quotation marks as received] 
  The two states pledge in the declaration to guarantee the 
rights of national minorities residing in Russia and Uzbekistan. 
  Russia and Uzbekistan seek to "strengthen coordination of 
their foreign political activity in consolidating peace and 
security, while focusing on interaction in settling regional 
conflicts and other disputes which infringe the interests of 
both states". 
  Russia and Uzbekistan intend to set up a mechanism of 
consultations in the interests of ensuring the safety of the 
external borders of the Commonwealth member states". 
  Yeltsin and Karimov also signed an agreement on military 
cooperation between the Russian Federation and the Republic of 
Uzbekistan to confirm the significance of the collective 
security agreement signed in Tashkent on May 15, 1992. The two 
countries noted that they would continue "efforts to deepen and 
cooperation in the military field and develop the adequate legal 
framework for the purpose".

  [Text] A Russian Space Force's Tsiklon-3 booster, made in 
the Yuzhmash factory, Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine, launched an 
unmanned orbiter station at 6:25 Moscow time [0325 GMT] on March 
2. The orbiter will observe the sun's activity as part of the 
joint Russian-Ukrainian Koronas-I project. 
  The project leader, member of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences 
Viktor Orayevskiy (director of the Institute of Earth Magnetism, 
Ionosphere and Radio Wave Propagation, in Troitsk, Moscow 
Region), emphasized that this was "the first cooperation project 
between the Russian and Ukrainian Academies of Sciences after 
the collapse of the USSR." 
  The orbiter will hopefully provide new insights into the 
Earth-sun interaction, the sun corona and the impact the sun 
activity makes on the Earth ionosphere. 
  Earlier space stations of this kind were named Interkosmos 
and carried equipment supplied by the East European countries. 
  The station is expected to stay at least three years in 
service.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Kulbitskiy and </F>
TRUD correspondent Rudolf Kolchanov: "Aid to Russia Will Be 
Continued"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 28 Feb -- The finance ministers and leaders 
of central banks of the seven leading Western countries held a 
routine meeting in the German city of Kronberg last Saturday [26 
February]. The participants analyzed the situation in the world 
economy, noting the positive changes in it, and discussed 
problems of stabilizing the Japanese yen and proposals for 
lowering the bank credit rate in the FRG. 
  But great attention was devoted to questions connected with 
giving financial aid to Russia. A. Shokhin, Russian minister of 
the economy; S. Dubinin, leader of the Ministry of Finance; and 
V. Gerashchenko, chairman of the Central Bank, were invited to 
the meeting in Kronberg. 
  Assessing the results of the meeting, at which the Western 
participants linked economic aid to the achievement of financial 
stability in Russia and to progress in implementing reforms, 
Shokhin declared, in particular: "The majority of the Western 
ministers said that the reforms in Russia must be carried out 
with due regard for the need to create a system of social 
protection for the population. Of course, no one in the West is 
prepared to allocate money to us for the unemployed and 
pensioners. But the West is showing readiness to elaborate a 
joint scheme of cooperation in the sphere of social protection." 
  "It seems to me," Shokhin went on to point out, "that we 
succeeded in convincing the finance ministers and the banks' 
leaders of `the seven' that it is necessary not only to promote 
the Russian reforms but also to seek new mechanisms of more 
intensive financial support also for the CIS countries, which on 
this basis will be able to build equitable relations with Russia 
more successfully. We recommended that the finance ministers 
`hurry up,' if I may use these words, and grant the first credit 
lines to the CIS countries (Russia has already received $1.5 
billion). This would strengthen the CIS countries' financial 
position and help them to pay off their debts to Russia." 
  Dubinin voiced confidence that "it will now be possible to 
attract to Russia the financial resources of `the seven' in the 
form of not just state but also private investments."

  [Text] On 1 March International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] experts are to begin the inspection of seven nuclear 
facilities in the DPRK. 
  Kondratiyev, commentator of this broadcasting network, said 
that the international community will undoubtedly welcome this. 
  He said: The people have waited for this news for a year. 
Talks among IAEA, Washington, and Pyongyang representatives on 
international inspection of nuclear facilities in North Korea 
necessitated such a delay. 
  North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty 
[NPT] in March 1993 and refused IAEA inspection of its nuclear 
facilities. The negative results of such a decision by North 
Korea should not be emphasized as many of them are being removed 
with the beginning of the inspection. 
  The affirmative results of Pyongyang's agreement to 
inspections are very clear. First, Washington and Seoul will 
suspend the Team Spirit joint military exercise, which was held 
every year. Second, talks for forming normal relations between 
the United States and North Korea will continue. A third round 
of talks will likely be held on 21 March. 
  What is the most important result is the resumption of 
North- 
South talks, because no one but the Korean people themselves can 
solve the problems on the Korean peninsula, including the 
denuclearization issue. 
  The North and the South of Korea had already reached an 
agreement on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula in 1991. 
The only thing remaining is the implementation of this plan. 
The resumption of working-level talks between the North and the 
South is scheduled on 3 March. 
  We cannot (?assess) at this moment the result of IAEA 
inspections of DPRK nuclear facilities. The beginning of the 
inspection, however, will exercise good influence on the Korean 
peninsula and on the overall political situation in this area.

  [Text] Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh came under 
bombardment from Azeri troops both last night and Tuesday 
morning despite the recent ceasefire agreement Stepanakert and 
Baku had signed with mediation from Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev. The agreement is effective from March 1. 
  Three Armenian soldiers were wounded as the Azeri army 
mounted artillery fire in the north of the Martuniskiy Region, 
the press office of the Karabakh Defense Forces told Interfax. 
The Azeri fire was not returned because of the ceasefire 
agreement, it said. 
  However, Armenian forces reserve the right to retaliate if 
Azerbaijan continues to violate the agreement, Chief of Staff of 
Karabakh Forces Seiran Oganian said.

  [Text] The Latvian Foreign Ministry expressed the hope that 
the explosion that destroyed a pylon of the power line supplying 
the Russian radar station in Skrunda would not affect the next 
round of Russo-Latvian talks due to start in Moscow on March 14. 
  The ministry's press secretary Ivars Embrekts, who told 
Interfax this, said: "We hope that the Russian authorities will 
understand that the Latvian government never approved of such 
activities and will do its best to make their repetition 
impossible." 
  He said that the investigation would be carried out by the 
criminal police and the prosecutor general's office in 
cooperation with officials of the Russian army and the Skrunda 
station. 
  Embrekts thought that the explosion could have been 
"organized either by those who want to obstruct the 
Russo-Latvian talks or common thugs who did not even know that 
important strategic assets of the Russian army were nearby. In 
any case the perpetrators will be punished in compliance with 
the Latvian law." 
  According to Embrekts, this was the essence of what Vladimir 
Ionkin, first secretary of the Russian embassy in Riga who 
handed a protest note to the Latvian Foreign Ministry, had been 
told.

  [Text] There are neither Russian troops, nor Russian 
servicemen on the territory of the Lithuanian Republic. There 
are only Russian citizens who arrive in the republic to see 
their families, INTERFAX was told by the Chief of the General 
Staff of the Lithuanian Army Stasys Knezys. 
  The statements about the presence of some other Russian 
servicemen in the republic, said Knezys, are groundless. The 
general staff of the Lithuanian Army has no information about 
incidents involving Russian servicemen, he said. 
  The statement was a response to the recent claim by the 
former commander of the coastal guard division, stationed in the 
Lithuanian port of Klaipeda, Major General Ivan Chernykh, that 
staying in Klaipeda are approximately 150 Russian officers 
"whose future has not been decided by the Russian Defence 
Ministry." He said that Lithuanian law enforcement bodies 
attempted last week to arrest one of the officers, Colonel 
Vitaliy Yegorov, who had been warned in advance and escaped the 
arrest.

  [Text] Moscow March 2 TASS -- The investigation of the 
criminal case on mass riots in Moscow on October 3-4 continues, 
says a report sent by the Russian prosecutor-general's office to 
ITAR-TASS on Wednesday. 
  The report says that the prosecutor-general's office has not 
investigated up to the end "circumstances connected with moral 
damage which should be reimbursed at the expense of the guilty 
parties according to operating legislation. 
  "it is also necessary to complete investigation against 
people who, employing the situation in Moscow which developed 
between September 21 and October 4, 1993, committed robberies, 
violence, acts of aggravated hooliganism and other law-breaking 
activities". 
  The prosecutor-general's office set up a commission to 
organise investigation into the case of October disorders. 
Results of its work will be reported later. 
  The prosecutor-general's office states at the same time that 
if pardoned people will again commit law violations, the office 
will use all its powers against law-breakers.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1725 GMT on 1 March carries the "Details" program, 
hosted by Sergey Dorenko, who discusses the balance of political 
forces in Russia after the release of the coup plotters from 
Lefortovo Prison over the weekend. 
  Dorenko introduces Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma, 
as an intelligent and diplomatic politician who was largely 
responsible for pacifying passions after the release. Rybkin 
had a meeting with President Yeltsin today, described by Dorenko 
as "scandalous because it did not produce any scandal." Dorenko 
continues: "Rybkin was surprised at the haste with which the 
Lefortovo inmates were released, said he did not know anything 
about the presidential staff pressurizing Kazannik, and declared 
that any fresh disturbances with old protagonists taking part 
will be suppressed by the president, whose actions will be 
supported by the Duma." Rybkin is then briefly shown comparing 
the coup plotters with some spoiled children who "screamed and 
cried, stamped their feet, or maybe dropped on the floor in the 
kitchen and kicked and got all covered with jam -- well, such 
things happen, you know." 
  Yeltsin's aide Georgiy Satarov then says in a short 
interview: "During the conversation when presidential staff 
tried to stop the procurator signing the amnesty order, Kazannik 
several times suggested disbanding the Duma -- he returned to 
this option about three times. It was Kazannik, the knight of 
righteousness who is guarding the law, who proposed this." 
  On the other hand, Dorenko says, "Rybkin could have made a 
good snake-charmer. He speaks in the quiet voice of a 
self-assured person. I entered his study today fully convinced 
that the authorities were going through another relationship 
crisis, and reemerged fully convinced that I had been 
hallucinating." "After the Duma won the main point, Ivan Rybkin 
is ready to make concessions about secondary points," he adds. 
  Rybkin then says in an interview clip: "God forbid that 
those 
who are being released today thanks to the magnanimity of their 
country, the president, and the State Duma should spurn it or 
forget about it and start again, in the Moscow streets or 
elsewhere, the political thuggery which led to the tragic events 
of 4 October. The president, together with the State Duma and 
the Federation Council, will take most severe measures to stop 
such behavior. My personal opinion is that they [putschists] 
will have enough goodwill, intelligence, and human decency to 
behave differently." 
  Dorenko then comments on the chances of a state of emergency 
being introduced. He says this is unlikely because neither the 
Duma nor Yeltsin's closest entourage are interested in it. He 
continues: "I understood from my conversation with Rybkin today 
that he would not play the card of miners' discontent, so that 
the idea of introducing the state of emergency would not as much 
as enter the president's mind." "The main compromise of the day 
is that the Duma has exchanged the release of Lefortovo 
prisoners for their arrest in case of even the slightest future 
misbehavior. Rybkin has managed to persuade Yeltsin that this 
is exactly what he, Yeltsin, has always wanted. As for the 
Kazannik episode, which looks so vexatiously embarrassing 
against this idyllic background, the authorities say it was just 
a misunderstanding," Dorenko concludes.

  [Text] Moscow, 1 Mar -- On 15 January the Federal 
Counter-Intelligence Service halted the espionage activities of 
a senior employee at one of Russia's defense-industry 
enterprises, who had been recruited by the British secret 
services. 
  Criminal proceedings have commenced, ITAR-TASS was told by 
the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service. The arrested man was 
charged on 25 January with betrayal of the homeland, to which he 
has confessed in full. 
  Preliminary investigations have provided evidence that the 
accused was provided with special equipment for espionage 
(ciphers and instructions on how to secretly communicate in 
Moscow with intelligence at the British embassy). 
  In return for money, the Russian citizen gathered and passed 
on to the British secret services classified information of a 
military and economic nature.

  [Text] Moscow March 1 TASS -- The Russian 
counterintelligence service arrested a leading Russian official 
from an organisation of the military-industrial complex who was 
spying for British secret services. 
  The arrested is charged with treason in the form of 
espionage, TASS was told by the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service on Tuesday which added that the spy had been arrested on 
January 15 and faced criminal charges on January 25. 
  The service said that, according to preliminary 
investigation, the official was equipped with special spying 
devices (cyphers, instructions on using hiding-places for 
supplying information to the British Embassy in Moscow). 
  "On orders of British special services and for monetary 
remuneration the Russian citizen collected and passed classified 
information of military and economic character", the service 
said. 
  The counterintelligence service said the spy had sold 
information on the latest Russian research in new armaments and 
their technical characteristics, on financing military research 
and development, on the state and prospects of Russian military 
cooperation with foreign countries.

statement by NDP chairman Giorgi Chanturia, which says: 
  "The grave situation in Georgia, in particular the 
parliament's unlawful decision on 1 March with regard to Georgia 
joining the CIS, has stripped the Georgian people and the whole

voluntarily dragged into the foundation of the new Russian 
empire at a phenomenal speed. 
  "In connection with this and other issues, I resort to the 
widely spread practice in the West and am challenging the head 
of state Eduard Shevardnadze to live television debates. 
  "As on the eve of the visit by the head of state to the 
United States, when it became physically possible to adopt 
hastily an unlawful resolution, then I consider that there will 
also be time to hold television debates between us, provided 
that the head of state, beside having arguments, has the wish to 
participate in debates."

<F P=106> [Interview with Islam Abduganiyevich Karimov, president of </F>
Uzbekistan, by correspondent Shakhnoza Ganiyeva; place and date 
not given; from the "Utro" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Ganiyeva] Islam Abduganiyevich, your official 
visit to Russia begins today. What prospects do you see for 
cooperation with the Russians? 
  [Karimov] I have always said and I wish to reiterate once 
more today that, Uzbekistan cannot see its future without 
Russia. Regardless of the difficulties or artificial barriers 
that are raised between us on issues of cooperation and economic 
ties, and relations in other directions as well, I have always 
been convinced and remain convinced that Russia and Uzbekistan 
should be together in the most difficult conditions through 
which we are living today. Of course, I am also convinced that 
there will be prosperity which we will both share. 
  It is difficult to specify the directions in which we can 
cooperate. The fact is the directions and forms of cooperation 
as well as their depth are so boundless that it is difficult to 
speak about some specific direction. Today, at every step we 
feel the breakdown in economic ties, difficulties in economic 
relations, as well as on questions of payments, more so since we 
introduced our own currency. Every day, at every turn, and at 
every step we feel that we cannot live without one another. I 
would once more like to emphasize the significance of our visit. 
I am confident the hopes which the Russian and Uzbek people 
place on us, on our meeting, and on the signing of documents 
which we are counting on, will be invariably justified. 
  [Ganiyeva] Islam Abduganiyevich, very briefly, what 
documents will be signed as a result of this visit? 
  [Karimov] First of all there will be the document on 
deepening economic integration in relations between Russia and 
Uzbekistan. Second there will be the document on general 
guidelines for deepening all-around cooperation between Russia 
and Uzbekistan. The third document will be on cooperation in 
military technical spheres.

<F P=106> [Vasiliy Kononenko report: "I. Karimov Promises Not To </F>
Tolerate Discrimination"] 
  [Text] "Uzbekistan has no future without Russia," 
Uzbekistan President I. Karimov stated while on an official 
visit to Moscow. Confirmation of this is the package of 
documents signed in the Kremlin by B. Yeltsin and I. Karimov. 
  The key document among them is the Russian-Uzbek 
Declaration, 
noting the principles of friendly relations between the two 
countries and a mutual interest in developing bilateral links. 
The spectrum of these is broad, and it is elaborated in detail 
in the economic and military treaties. But this list lacks an 
extremely important document which is vital for guaranteeing the 
rights of the Russian-speaking population in Uzbekistan. It was 
learned that I. Karimov is not as yet prepared to sign the 
treaty on dual citizenship proposed by Russia. But he did give 
the Russian president assurances that he will not tolerate human 
rights infringements on ethnic grounds.

  [Text] "They will be the first-ever democratic elections in 
Kazakhstan, the first elections in which political parties and 
movements will be taking part," Nazarbayev said. He called on 
all electors, regardless of their ethnic origins, to vote for 
those who "will be promoting in parliament ideas of market 
economics, for those who stand for a powerful executive branch 
and presidential government." He also appealed for support for 
the candidates he had proposed. 
  Nazarbayev expressed the confidence that the people of 
Kazakhstan would not "swallow the bait of shallow carpers, 
persons pursuing narrow nationalistic personal aims or 
populists." Otherwise "we will end up with total discord in 
parliament, the kind we see in the `near abroad,'" he said. 
  In his view, Kazakhstan has a chance to overcome its present 
crisis faster than any other CIS country, due to the diligence 
of its population, its tremendous natural resources and its 
extensive export opportunities. He said some progress had been 
made with economic reforms and that gold production had somewhat 
gone up. By 1996, he said, the republic would have enough gold 
to keep its currency stable without large dollar infusions. The 
loans provided by foreign business would top $2.5 Bn [billion] 
in that year, he said. 
  The president also said it was essential to strengthen 
political stability in Kazakhstan. "What explains 
(international) interest in our state and its influence in the 
international arena are not only its natural wealth and 
strategic position but also the stability of its social and 
political life," he said. In this connection, he called for a 
serious attitude to the problems of migration, citizenship and 
language and expressed support for the idea of convening an 
assembly of peoples of Kazakhstan. 
  Nazarbayev suggested making amendments to the Constitution 
that would authorize parliament to dismiss the president and 
would give the president the right to dissolve parliament. He 
said he would like the new legislature to be bicameral. 
  The president said he would urge the new parliament to 
launch 
an onslaught on crime. He said murderers, rapists and heads of 
criminal bands should be put to death without fail. He believes 
that citizens of other states who have committed a crime in 
Kazakhstan must bot be extradited to their home countries but be 
punished in Kazakhstan on the basis of the Kazakh law. 
  He said stronger penalties were needed for the theft of 
motor 
vehicles, burglary and robbery, and that the population should 
be allowed to keep weapons to defend their homes and property.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Skorokhodov: "Golden Rain. What To Do </F>
With Dollar Loans and Credits"] 
  [Text] Almaty -- Vice Premier Akezhan Kazhegeldin has told 
journalists how many dollars foreign countries are promising 
Kazakhstan this year. The total is more than $1 billion. But 
the republic will need the same amount again to cover the 
expected budget deficit of 4 percent of GNP. 
  "First and foremost there is the rehabilitation loan, 
whereby 
Austria gives us $5 million, Sweden and Turkey $2 million each, 
the United States $31 million, the European Union $60 million, 
the Asian Development Bank $34 million, international financial 
corporations $30 million, the World Bank $256 million, and 
Russia $20 million... In all we get $719.3 million." The vice 
premier began the meeting with these figures. 
  Moreover, Kazakhstan is promised trade credits worth $296.9 
million. Finally, there will also be technical aid, to get 
market structures operating in Kazakhstan. It will amount to 
more than $72 million. More than $40 million of this is grants, 
that is, they are nonrepayable. If you add all this up, it 
could mean that more than $1.344 billion will be injected into 
the economy this year. 
  How does the republic intend to use these financial 
injections? Some $255 million from the IMF will go to the 
National Bank to support the tenge. Some $719 million will be 
used to keep the balance of payments deficit from exceeding 4 
percent of GNP, which is an essential condition imposed by the 
creditors. How Kazakhstan intends to settle all these loans is 
another matter. Indeed, it is already committed to an outlay of 
$85 million this year to service credits. 
  Russia's position is interesting in connection with the 
dollar euphoria in the republic. It is itself a donor to 
Kazakhstan. In the first place it actively interceded on 
Kazakhstan's behalf in the Paris Club, evidently reckoning that 
dollar injections there would support the reforms in Russia 
itself. Second, as in the past, it granted technical credit in 
rubles. 
  Vice Premier Kazhegeldin believes that if it carries on like 
this, if the reforms are implemented "according to plan," then 
Kazakhstan itself will become a donor-country in five or six 
years' time and will help these countries with credits.

Kharchenko] 
  [Text] Dushanbe March 2 TASS -- Tajik Foreign Minister 
Rashid Alimov sent a message to CSCE Chairman Beniamino 
Andreatta in which he highly assessed informal attention paid by 
CSCE to processes of integration of Tajikistan into the world 
community and efforts made by this authoritative organisation to 
stabilise the socio-political situation in Tajikistan. 
  The message forwarded on Wednesday expressed hope for 
further 
development of cooperation between CSCE and Tajikistan. "It is 
not only Tajikistan that is interested in CSCE, but CSCE is 
interested in Tajikistan as well; therefore, it is extremely 
important to develop the concept of" Tajikistan being CSCE 
southern gates," the message said. 
  Alimov pointed out that CSCE might render Tajikistan not 
only 
economic and technical assistance, but help carry out market 
reforms in the republic and hold general democratic elections in 
autumn, 1994. 
  Touching upon the internal situation in Tajikistan, the 
Tajik 
Foreign Minister pointed out that the Tajik Government 
reiterates its adherence to the sublime idea of a law-governed 
democratic country and regards this process as a long and 
difficult road leading, primarily, to comprehensive guarantees 
and defence of human rights in the country. It was pointed out 
in the message that unless reliable guarantees of human rights 
are ensured all other democratic principles are pointless. 
  According to the Tajik minister, Tajik leaders managed to 
achieve certain stabilisation in the republic and begin the 
restoration of the economy. Military operations have been 
practically ceased in the republic. Efforts made to this end 
helped reach certain social and political stabilisation and the 
cessation of military operations on the Tajik territory. 
  It was announced that a nationwide referendum would be held 
on problems of the Tajik statehood and general democratic 
elections scheduled in autumn, 1994. Declaring their readiness 
for a dialogue with political forces of different orientation, 
Tajik authorities are taking concrete measures to launch 
negotiations with their opponents in the near future. 
  These talks are expected to be attended by the special envoy 
of the U.N. secretary general in Tajikistan, Ramiro Ballona.

  [Text] Dushanbe March 2 TASS -- Russian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Anatoliy Adamishin paid a short visit to Dushanbe on 
Tuesday, where he discussed with Tajik leaders a political 
situation in Tajikistan and ways to stabilise it. The Russian 
diplomat had a meeting with chairman of the Tajik parliament 
Imamali Rakhmanov. Problems, discussed by them, included the 
speeding up of a dialogue with political opposition. 
  Adamishin praised the efforts of the Tajik leaders, aimed at 
establishing peace in Tajikistan. He said that Dushanbe had 
displayed goodwill, and now it is the turn of the opposition 
forces to take reciprocal steps. According to Adamishin, the 
Russian Federation agrees to organise a meeting, probably in 
Moscow, between representatives of the political opposition and 
the Tajik leadership under the aegis of the U.N. 
  "Now it is the turn of the opposition to reciprocate, and it 
should show by its deeds what it really wants," Adamishin 
stressed. 
  ITAR-TASS learned, however, that Khodzhiakbar 
Turadzhon-Zoda, 
former spiritual leader of Tajik Moslems and now deputy chairman 
of the Islamic Movement of Tajikistan, who is now in emigration, 
said in an interview with the Tehran-based newspaper KAYHAN that 
he does not recognise the present government of Tajikistan and 
will never stop fighting it. At the same time, the former 
spiritual leader of Tajikistan does not reject a possibility of 
a political dialogue with the republican leaders, but he 
believes the meeting should be held in Tehran. in his opinion, 
Iran and Afghanistan should be intermediaries. Khodzhiakbar 
Turadzhon-Zoda is one of influential leaders of the 
irreconcilable opposition.

the court decision to drop criminal proceedings against the 
accused. 
  On Tuesday the court dropped criminal charges against the 
defendants following the Duma-proclaimed amnesty. 
  "The prosecution believes that the court decision 
contradicts 
the criminal-procedural code of the Russian Federation, 
according to which any court investigation which is underway 
should be carried out to the end and a guilty or non-guilty 
verdict passed", the office of the prosecutor general said in a 
statement received by TASS on Wednesday.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Gamov report on telephone interview with Russian </F>
State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin; place and date of interview not 
given: "Evening Call to Ivan Rybkin"] 
  [Text] [Gamov] Ivan Petrovich, the State Duma's amnesty 
decision provoked a stormy outburst of emotions in society and a 
sharp protest and alarm among many Russians due to the possible 
exacerbation of the political situation in the country. Does 
this worry you personally? 
  [Rybkin] For some reason one decree is being taken out of 
the context of all the State Duma decrees adopted 23 February, 
namely the one on a political and economic amnesty. Although we 
have issued a package of five documents, the main one of them 
being the Memorandum on Accord which says that, together with 
the government and president and other federal power structures, 
we must elaborate in the next two to three months joint 
approaches toward solving a wide range of problems of a 
political, economic, national, and social nature. 
  All this work should have preceded the implementation of the 
decree on an amnesty, because the amnesty itself is supposed to 
last quite a long time. Under the president's legislative 
initiative it is proposed to release a total of 222,000 people 
from places of confinement and national economic construction 
sites, plus those involved in the events of August 1991 and 
September and October 1993. 
  It turned out that some inconsistency arose in implementing 
the adopted decisions because of insufficiently efficient 
coordination between the authorities. Undoubtedly all this 
creates certain problems in society. Nevertheless, based on the 
provisions of the Memorandum on Accord, we must see to it that 
the people who have been released find their place in this life 
and that they are actively included in constructive work to 
extricate Russia from the crisis. 
  I think an absolute majority of them will do just that. But 
if some people lack the intelligence, the heart, or the desire 
to work for accord.... The state has the strength to put them 
in their place. Especially as the supplement to the Criminal 
Code, which has already been given its first reading and which 
will, I hope, acquire the force of law in the near future, 
envisages the strengthening of punishments relating precisely to 
the entire range of articles referred to in the decree on an 
amnesty.

  [Text] Ex-president of the USSR Mikhail Gorbachev stated 
that although the Supreme Court's Military Collegium had 
terminated the trial of the 1991 coup leaders, the circumstances 
of the August putsch must be analyzed and proper lessons taken 
from them. 
  "The events in August 1991 and in October 1993 are 
complicated and extraordinary, with uneasy consequences. No one 
can easily forget them," he told Interfax on Wednesday. 
  "The situation whereby the state is ruined, the president 
thrown down and the parliament shelled, and all this is 
forgotten is a bad example and a bad precedent," he said. 
  "In compensation for that, we must be given hope for 
national 
reconciliation which alone can justify such steps (the 
termination of the trial of the 1991 coup leaders -- Interfax). 
There can be no other justification. Such things are 
unpardonable," said Gorbachev. 
  Commenting on ex-prisoner of Lefortovo Aleksandr Rutskoy's 
statement, circulated on Wednesday, Gorbachev described it as 
"responsible" and "reflecting serious intentions". Rutskoy 
urged the Russian citizens to maintain peace and national accord.

was adopted by a majority of deputies in the State Duma with the 
aim of destabilizing the situation in Russia. Gaydar was 
speaking in Moscow at an assembly of democratic members of 
society devoted to the situation which has developed in Russia 
since the amnesty. 
  Approximately 1,000 people took part in the assembly. These 
included representatives of the Democratic Russia Movement, the 
Living Ring Union, and other democratic organizations.

  [Text] Moscow, March 1 TASS -- Former parliament speaker 
Ruslan Khasbulatov released on Saturday from Lefortovo jail in 
accordance with the Duma amnesty, is leaving tonight for the 
Chechen capital Groznyy. 
  According to his spokesman Konstantin Zlobin, in Chechnya 
Khasbulatov will see his mother who resides there. After some 
recreation, the former speaker is going to resume working on a 
book on relations between legislative and executive powers which 
he started to write in prison. 
  However, Zlobin denied reports that Khasbulatov intended to 
settle in Chechnya permanently. 
  Khasbulatov, ethnic Chechen, had been elected to the 
previous 
Russian legislature from Russia's southern republic of Chechnya. 
He was deprived of the Chechen citizenship when refused to 
leave parliament after the independence-seeking republic called 
back all its deputies. The citizenship was returned to 
Khasbulatov after he was jailed as a ringleader of the October 
hard-line revolt in Moscow what intstantly made him "a national 
hero" in Chechnya.

  [Text] Moscow March 3 TASS - President Boris Yeltsin issued 
a decree on Thursday, appointing Sergey Stepashin, 42, director 
of the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service. 
  Stepashin graduated from a military school of the Soviet 
Union's Interior Ministry, a military academy and served in 
special troops of the Interior Ministry. He taught at the 
Leningrad school of the Interior Ministry and has a master of 
sciences degree in history. 
  Stepashin repeatedly visited "flash points" in the former 
Soviet Union (Baku, Ferghana, Nagorno-Karabakh and Abkhazia). 
  He served as legislator between 1990 and 1993, heading the 
Russian parliament committee on defence and security. 
  Stepashin worked as deputy minister of security in 1991-1992 
and as first deputy minister from September 1992. He is a 
member of the Russian Security Council. 
  Stepashin was appointed first deputy director of the Federal 
Counter-Intelligence Service on December 21, 1993.

  [Text] According to sources close to the administration of 
the Russian president, a new reorganization of the former KGB, 
at present the Federal Service of Counterintelligence, is under 
way. There are two options. According to the first one, Russian 
counterintelligence will be renamed the Federal Directorate of 
Investigations and will be part of the Justice Ministry, as in 
America. 
  The second option calls for the transfer of the former KGB 
under the control of the president. In both cases Russian 
counterintelligence may lose its status as an independent 
federal body and may simply become a subdivision of either one 
or the other state directorate. 
  Some analysts see in the proposed reform an attempt by 
interested parties, including foreign ones, to finally lower the 
status of Russia's state security structures. According to the 
source, the appointment of the head of the Federal Service of 
Counterintelligence, who will most probably be Sergey Stepashin, 
will be announced at the same time as a decree about the 
reorganization of the former KGB.

Continues"] 
  [Text] MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has learned from reliable 
sources that the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service 
[FCS] will be reorganized once again. 
  It is planned to split the FCS and to subordinate the 
splinters to various ministries. For instance, the main service 
-- the Administration of Counterintelligence Operations -- will 
be renamed the Federal Administration of Investigations and 
subordinated to the Justice Ministry. The Military 
Counterintelligence Service is to become part of the Defense 
Ministry General Staff as a main administration. The Economy 
Ministry will also acquire its own counterintelligence service. 
It will be the Economic Counterintelligence Administration. 
  It is planned to strip military ranks from staffers of the 
new special services to be set up on the basis of the FCS 
(except for the military counterintelligence service). Instead, 
counterespionage system officers will have the following 
positions: agent, agent second class, special agent, and so 
forth. 
  In the course of reform it is planned to cut down the FCS 
central staff so as to strengthen the special service's regional 
branches at its expense. It is even possible that the entire 
central staff of the former FCS may move from the capital to 
nearby areas of Moscow Oblast. The reorganization of the FCS 
will be completed within the next six months.

<F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report: "LDPR Used Fake Payment Orders. </F>
Galaktika and Mayak Radio Stations File a Suit"] 
  [Text] It is an open secret that the LDPR's [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia] overwhelming success in the Federal 
Assembly elections was largely predetermined by Vladimir 
Zhiriovskiy's clever use of the press, far outracing his 
competitors in penetrating the electric mass media. The issue 
of the origin of funds that enabled Mr. Zhirinovskiy's to 
address his fellow countrymen so often has been discussed at all 
levels by all persons concerned. New information, however, 
forces a different approach to the question of the LDPR's 
hypothetical financial power. Apparently at least part of the 
LDPR's campaign was financed by counterfeit payment orders 
issued on behalf of organizations which were not going to 
contest the elections. 
  On 6 December the LDPR sent payment order 28 for 26 million 
rubles through Progressbank to the Galaktika radio station, 
which is the prime contractor of the Ostankino TV and radio 
company's Publitsist studio, in payment for "LDPR's election 
campaign transmissions in the Novaya Volna program from 1 
December to 12 December 1993." According to Vladimir Lugovinov, 
general director of the Publitsist studio, the "payment order" 
was to cover expenses of three hours of air time made available 
to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to conduct his election campaign. 
  At the same time, a letter came to the Mayak radio station 
accounts department signed by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy asking to 
make air time available; somewhat later, payment order 78/93, 
for 10,719,737 rubles as of 6 December, came from Progressbank. 
The LPDR leader received 69 minutes of air time. 
  In spite of the "payment orders," no money came to the radio 
companies' accounts. Their representatives asked Progressbank 
to explain the delay in the money transfer. On 24 January V.G. 
Znayko, chairman of Progressbank's governing board, said that 
payment orders 28 of 1 December 1993 and 78/93 of the same date 
were not found among the bank's documents. Radio company 
representatives tried to contact the LDPR's member who conducted 
talks on allocating air time available to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. 
No coherent answer was received. The victim organizations 
intend to go to court.

broadcasting stations have taken legal steps against 
Zhirinovskiy: The Liberal Democratic Party [LDPR] paid with 
forged payment documents for its advertising programmes during 
the electoral campaign, the SEGODNYA newspaper wrote today. 
  The Liberal Democratic Party, which got four hours and nine 
minutes of broadcasting time for its advertising, failed to 
transfer to bank accounts of the broadcasting stations 36 
million 719,737 roubles. The Zhirinovskiy party sent to the 
editorial boards only the copies of payment documents. V. 
Zagnoiko, chairman of the board of Progressbank, denied the fact 
of the transfer of money by the Liberal Democratic Party to the 
broadcasting stations.

  [Text] Moscow, March 3 (AFP) -- Ultra-nationalist leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy faces thousands of dollars in unpaid bills 
for media spots during his campaign for the December 
parliamentary elections, two newspapers reported Thursday [3 
March]. 
  Two radio stations were considering taking legal action 
against the head of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia after 
he failed to pay for more than four hours of radio time, priced 
21,000 dollars, the reports in SEVODNYA and MOSKOVSKIY 
KOMSOMOLETS newspapers said. 
  During the campaign, the state picked up the tab for three 
hours of radio time and two hours of television time for each 
party. Additional time was meant to be paid for by the 
candidates themselves. 
  The newspapers published copies of payment orders signed by 
the Zhirinovskiy party for two banks. However the papers quoted 
the head of one of the banks as saying the documents did not 
belong to his bank. 
  A spokesman for the Liberal-Democratic party told AFP it was 
"up to the banks to pay the bills they were told to and that it 
couldn't possibly be a question of financial fiddling by 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy." 
  Various reports have estimated the cost of radio and TV time 
used by the ultra-nationalist leader, who won 23 percent of the 
vote, at between 70,000 and 650,000 dollars. 
  Russia media charge up to one million rubles (6,500 dollars) 
for a minute of time. 
  Last month a rival candidate in Zhirinovskiy's suburban 
Moscow constituency of Shelokovo lodged a formal complaint of 
violations of the electoral law during the December 12 vote 
which the ultra-nationalist leader won. 
  Zhirinovskiy's election could be invalidated by a court if 
the charges are substantiated.

  [Text] Today's sitting of the Russian Security Council was 
devoted to the fight against crime, a subject Boris Yeltsin 
broached in his address to parliament. 
  [Correspondent Vladimir Perfilyev] Head of state Boris 
Yeltsin led the meeting. Two issues were examined: The federal 
anti-crime program for this year and 1995, and the German 
general consulate in Kaliningrad. President Yeltsin said that 
the crime situation was posing a serious problem in Russia at 
the moment. There is organized crime not just in separate 
areas, but in the near abroad [former Soviet republics] and 
abroad. 
  The low level of efficiency of the law-enforcing and 
judicial 
bodies is one of the main reasons for the increase in crime. It 
is now the norm that criminals get off practically scot-free as 
the crime fighting bodies remain ill-equipped for the job. 
  On the subject of amnesty, President Yeltsin said: 
  [Begin Yeltsin recording] I hope that the federal program to 
step up the fight against crime will mark a change and become a 
significant social document in the difficult work of the 
law-enforcing and judicial bodies. I would like to stress that 
those amnestied by the State Duma will be rearrested in 
accordance with our laws as soon as they start any political or 
other activity detrimental to the security of the Russian state. 
The main result of our sitting today should not just be that we 
looked into adopting the federal program, but that it will now 
be implemented quickly. We need to display action as soon as 
possible to convince Russian citizens that the state is capable 
of dealing with the social evil that crime is. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 2 TASS -- The concurrence of stands of 
the State Duma and the presidential address on problems of the 
economic reform was stressed at a briefing, held in the Kremlin 
today, by Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the State Duma Committee 
on Economic Policy. For the first time since December 12, this 
created a basis for joint actions of the two branches of power 
in implementing the economic reform. 
  Glazyev believes that "the work of the government does not 
correspond exactly to the political course, outlined in the 
presidential address to the Federal Assembly." Substantiating 
his point of view, he cited numerous facts of privileges granted 
by the government to some enterprises and industries, of 
mistakes made in the sphere of economic restructuring and the 
implementation of the privatization programme. Instead of 
supporting science-intensive industry on a priority basis, it 
was nearly ruined: The reduction of output reached the 
catastrophic level of 90 per cent. This is true of 
microelectronics and precise machine-building. 
  According to Glazyev, it is necessary to insist on the 
adoption of laws, which will simplify the tax system and make it 
more rational, establish order in the sphere of tax collecting 
and toughen criminal responsibility for the violation of the 
currency and customs legislation. In this case the state will 
have enough strength for supporting priority industries.

  [Text] The renovated Communist Party supports holding free 
democratic elections to Russia's legislature and scrapping the 
presidency as an institution. The date and procedure for the 
elections are to be determined by a round-table conference of 
all parties and political movements of the country, according to 
the party's central committee coordinating secretary, Sergey 
Skvortsov. He published this statement in Moscow today on the 
eve of an expanded government meeting to discuss ways out of the 
economic crisis scheduled for March 4. 
  According to Skvortsov, the way out of the crisis "lies in 
the total rejection of the so-called course of reforms rather 
than its adjustment proposed by the Duma opposition. It is 
evident that a bankrupt president does not want this and cannot 
do this, just as the stillborn Duma does not want this and 
cannot give up the course either." 
  In Skvortsov's opinion, Russian President Boris Yeltsin "in 
his address 'On the state of the nation' virtually recognized 
the total bankruptcy of his policy and recognized the existing 
practice of unilateral concessions to the West as unbefitting." 
  However, "Yeltsin made these statements by no means to 
ground 
his resignation." Vice versa, "having lost a considerable part 
of his social base, the president is trying not to let power out 
of his hands by looking for support in the present Duma 
opposition," according to the coordinating secretary. 
  To avoid social upheavals, it is necessary to bring about 
changes to the current situation in the country and find 
politicians who would really stand up for the people's 
interests, the renovated Communist Party leader believes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Round the Clock Non-Stop" </F>
rubric: "Revival of Federal Information Center?"] 
  [Text] The reorganization of the president's apparatus and 
staff is being completed. The way MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS sees 
it, today will witness the signing of an edict on the creation 
of an Administration for Information Support of the Russian 
Federation President's Staff. A likely appointee to the 
position of the administration's head is Petr Filippov. (He is 
now in charge of the analytical center for socioeconomic policy). 
  The administration's structure calls for three departments: 
a department for work with the press, a department for work 
with television, and an analytical department. Some 40 people 
will be on the payroll. 
  Quite possibly, accusations of open propaganda and agitation 
will be showered on the future administration. Indeed, it sets 
as its goal not just a mechanical transfer of information to the 
mass media, but also its analysis and interpretation. 
  MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has managed to learn that the 
immediate plan of the future administration's work includes 
summing up and analyzing all information coming from the 
regions. Also planned are regular conferences in Moscow of the 
heads of regional press services with representatives of the 
president.

  [Text] As has become known, in the draft budget which will 
be submitted for examination by the Russian Government, 
expenditures for the upkeep of state television and radio 
companies are envisaged at only 25 percent of requirements. 
These funds are not even enough to pay for the operation of 
television and radio transmitters. Here is what was said in 
this connection by Aleksandr Nekhoroshev, the director of 
Russian Television's "Vesti" program. 
  [Begin Nekhoroshev recording] This means that the Ministry 
of 
Communications, which must receive 85 percent of this amount for 
the upkeep of transmitters, will be forced to switch off the 
transmitters because of non-payment. That is to say, from the 
minute that the government approves this harmful budget for 
television and radio, we could all expect at any minute the 
switching off of state television and radio and, in this way, 
perhaps the last instrument for unifying the inhabitants of our 
country, Russians scattered accross our great power, could be 
broken. 
  The idea has already been voiced that this government will 
close state television and radio but that another structure of 
the government will open it. These are questions for the 
government and the people who are working in it. 
  We are also worried because, taking into account the 
aggressiveness of all commercial structures, we are absolutely 
convinced that both in Moscow and in the regions, from the 
moment state television and radio are closed, great efforts will 
be made to seize them. In this way we are now all on the 
threshold of a danger which on the whole was deflected both in 
August 1991 and October. Attempts to stifle in particular the 
All-Russian TV and Radio Company failed then, and this was 
splendid. Now, however, by the hands of bureaucrats, quietly, 
by one stroke of the pen, something could be perpetrated which 
even in my worst dreams I am unable to imagine. 
  On behalf of the journalists of the All-Russian TV and Radio 
Company I can now request Premier Minister Chernomyrdin for an 
immediate meeting in order to discuss the catastrophic situation 
in which state television and radio finds itself. It seems to 
me that for the time being there still is some sense in holding 
this meeting. It could very well be the case that after Friday 
there will no longer be any sense in holding such a meeting.

<F P=106> [Announcement by ROSSIYSKIY VESTI editorial collegium: </F>
"ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI Is Back With You, Readers!"] 
  [Text] After an enforced one-month break, ROSSIYSKIYE 
VESTI is being published in a print run of 650,000. This means 
that not only all its subscribers in Russia, but also readers in 
114 world countries will receive the paper. 
  The suspension in publication of the paper was not the 
editorial board's fault but the result of interruptions in 
budget funding. Nevertheless, the journalistic collective 
believes it is responsible to readers and apologizes to all for 
the resultant loss of information. Naturally, the information 
that you failed to receive during this period is irreplaceable, 
but we will try to repay our debts by other means: The break 
provided an opportunity to better consider and prepare a number 
of innovations. 
  Now each week, on Thursdays, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI will publish 
a 
16-page issue. This will make it possible to widen the range of 
reports on the most important aspects of the federal 
authorities' activities. The content of the newspaper's 
official section will also be enriched -- in addition to legal 
and administrative acts of the Russian Federation president and 
government, we will begin to carry the main Federal Assembly 
documents concerning the vital interests of the state, the 
population, and entrepreneurs. 
  We feel a special debt to those who have been unable 
recently 
to take advantage of the advice provided by our RETSEPT 
[Prescription] supplement. A consultative health center is 
being set up under the editorial board and the best medical 
forces are being recruited, and we hope that with their help we 
can be useful to those who bring their questions to us. We will 
tell you, Esteemed readers, about the work of this center and 
about how to use its services at a later date. 
  Pages 2 and 3 carry features under the rubrics "In Russia," 
"In the World," "Subjectively Speaking," and "Official." This 
has made it possible to give considerably broader coverage to 
events in our country's regions and throughout the world and to 
more fully present the spectrum of opinions on urgent problems 
of society's life while at the same time, as it were, putting 
the official position of state figures and institutions together 
in a special section. 
  Our other, traditional supplements, sections, and pages 
"Money," "Economics," VEKHI [Milestones], "Culture," "Leisure," 
"Sport," and so forth are also being updated. 
  With the help of professional lawyers and parliamentary 
deputies the editorial office wants to organize consultations on 
the most difficult and acute questions of protecting human 
rights. 
  We hope that there will be no more interruptions in 
publication. Stay with us!

  [Text] The Moscow Mayor's Office and its government refuted 
the allegations that a decision had been made to rebury the body 
of Vladimir Lenin. 
  The Moscow government transferred a statement to Interfax 
saying that the Moscow authorities had made no decisions on 
reburial of Lenin nor about his mausoleum. 
  In accordance with the Russian law on the status of Moscow, 
all buildings and facilities on the Moscow territory on which 
the legislative, executive and judicial bodies are situated 
belong to the Russian Federation. 
  The statement underlined that the Moscow City's Executive 
Committee had mentioned the Lenin Mausoleum among architectural 
monuments in March, 1987. 
  "This is to say that only the federal bodies can decide on 
the future of the mausoleum. However, the position of the 
Moscow government which defends the historical monument, must be 
taken into consideration," the statement says.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 2 TASS -- "By saying that inflation 
will be brought down to three to five per cent a month by the 
end of the year, Boris Yeltsin lent a shoulder to the government 
so that it could work for this goal," according to Aleksandr 
Livshits, who was appointed head of the presidential team of 
experts on Wednesday. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Livshits said that the main 
task facing the team is to analyse the effects of the economic 
policy, which was ignored by former First Deputy Prime Minister 
Yegor Gaydar. Experts will try to anticipate events by 
analysing possible negative consequences of proposed decisions 
and measures. 
  Like Gaydar, Livshits is a determined monetarist. His thesis 
on the theoretical principles of "Reaganomics" won him a degree 
of doctor of economics. In 1990 he wrote "introduction to a 
market economy", the first textbook of the kind in Russia. 
Before his transfer to the presidential analytical centre two 
years ago, Livshits headed the department of economic theory at 
the Moscow Machine Tool Engineering Institute. 
  Observers believe that Livshits will become the president's 
eye to monitor the pace of reform in Russia. 
  Livshits plans to work in close cooperation with Sergey 
Glazyev who heads the State duma committee for economic policy. 
He said the deputies welcomed Yeltsin's state-of-the-nation 
address. This provides a good basis for joint work of two 
branches of power in the economic sphere, Livshits said.

<F P=106> [Report by unidentified ITAR-TASS correspondent on interview </F>
with Dmitriy Lvov, deputy director of the Central 
Economic-Mathematics Institute; place and date of interview not 
given: "Dmitriy Lvov: Tax System Must Be Changed Radically"] 
  [Text] The president's message to parliament is a wonderful 
form in which to set out aims and objectives and ways of 
achieving them. Boris Yeltsin only partly took advantage of 
this opportunity. This is what Dmitriy Lvov, corresponding 
member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and deputy director of 
the Central Economic-Mathematics Institute, believes. The 
president's message to the Federal Assembly, he said in a 
conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, fairly fully 
reflects the range of questions which must be solved in order to 
extricate the country from the economic crisis, but it does not 
indicate how to do this. 
  The scientist believes that the message does not reveal the 
mechanisms ensuring that inflation is curbed and the production 
slump is halted, and the method of implementing the idea of 
state regulation of a market economy is also unknown. 
  The scientist was expecting greater clarity regarding tax 
questions. "In my opinion," he stressed, "our tax system is 
flawed. No less than two-thirds of all crisis factors are 
associated with it. All sociological polls show that the tax 
question is what worries both businessmen and ordinary workers 
most of all. If they escape with only minor changes in this 
matter, that means the noose around industry's neck will be 
pulled ever tighter. The present tax system must be changed 
radically. The tax problem is the same as the problem of the 
banking system's financial stabilization, and should be given 
utmost priority." 
  A large part of the message, Lvov observed, is taken up by 
the question of combating inflation. But here too, in his 
opinion, there are many uncertainties and even contradictions 
between the position of the president and the government. The 
Ministry of the Economy, for example, plans to reduce inflation 
to 7-9 percent by the end of the year, while the president's 
message demands that it be cut to 5 percent. "I have formed the 
impression," the scientist says, "that the president's figure is 
an obsession and has no economic basis. There is a vast gulf 
between the government's and the president's figures which 
represents many trillions of rubles. False interpretations are 
impermissible here."

  [Text] Russia's state budget revenues will amount to 120.7 
Tn [Trillion] rubles in 1994, and spending -- 182.2 Tn rubles, 
the deficit standing at 61.5 Tn rubles, says the draft of the 
federal budget, proposed by the Finance Ministry. 
  In the Finance Ministry's estimate, by the end of the year 
the budget deficit will go down to 10.2% of the gross 
domestic 
product. 
  The federal budget's revenues will be 7 times greater than 
last year, the basic sources of revenues being taxes, whose 
share in the gross domestic product will amount to 12.7% 
compared to 10.3% in 1993. 
  Hard-currency revenues and foreign-trade payments are 
estimated at $6.1 Bn [Billion]. The basic sources of 
hard-currency revenue are export and import duties and income 
gained from the centralized credit. 
  Spending is estimated at 25.1% of the gross domestic 
product, compared to 21.0% in 1993. Financial support for 
the 
territories will represent the biggest spending item 
(13.4%). 
The growing financial support for the territories is due to a 
new system of relations between the federal budget and the 
budgets of Russia's constituent members. Expenditures for the 
repayment and servicing of the state debt will also increase to 
10.5%. 
  The share of defense spending will practically not change -- 
37126.0 Bn rubles (20.4% of total expenditures). 
  Spending on social, cultural and research programs will 
amount to 2.2% of the gross domestic product. Compared to 
1993, the federal spending on social and research programs will 
increase 3.6 times. 
  The report also contains the main indices for 1993. Last 
year's spending stood at 34.1 Tn rubles (75.1% of the 
adjusted 
budget). 
  By January 1, 1994 the state budget deficit amounted to 17 
Tn 
rubles (10.5% of the gross domestic product). The deficit 
was 
covered at the expense of the gold and hard-currency reserve 
(5.1 Tn rubles). 
  Due to nonpayment of taxes and other payments to the state, 
the spending items had to be reduced by 8.5 Tn rubles. 
  The report says that for the first time in many years there 
was a growth of the population's real incomes. The average 
income grew about 11 times while prices rose 9.4 times. This is 
proved by the wage and salary increases in dollar terms. The 
average salary grew 3 times and stands at about $100.

<F P=106> [Oleg Falichev report: "Army Reforms Going According to </F>
Plan"] 
  [Text] Do the reforms in the Army correspond to the 
realities of life? Are they going in the right direction? What 
has already been done in this sphere, and what is planned in the 
very near future? These are not easy questions. Answers to 
them were given at a news conference held by the Russian 
Federation Defense Ministry Information and Press Directorate. 
It was addressed by Colonel General V. Zhurbenko, first deputy 
chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff; 
Lieutenant General G. Ivanov, chief of the Russian Federation 
Defense Ministry Military Building and Reforms Directorate; 
Lieutenant General G. Bochayev, first deputy chief of the 
General Staff Main Organization and Mobilization Directorate; 
and representatives of other directorates of the General Staff 
and Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation. 
  The occasion for this was the Russian president's message to 
the Federal Assembly "On Strengthening the Russian State." As 
is known, one of its sections is devoted to an analysis and 
assessment of the reforms in the Army and to what the Russian 
Armed Forces should be like in the very near future. 
  "The Armed Forces are going through a very complex stage in 
their development today," Col. Gen. Zhurbenko pointed out. "It 
is necessary simultaneously to implement measures to create the 
Russian Army and to withdraw troops from East and Central 
European countries and also the Baltic countries." 
  Naturally, all this cannot fail to leave its mark on the 
processes taking place in the Army. Not a single army in the 
world is thought to have tackled such large-scale and complex 
tasks. And yet not so much time has elapsed since it started to 
be reformed. The building of the Russian Armed Forces began 7 
May 1992 -- with the promulgation of the president's edict on 
the creation of the Russian Federation Armed Forces. During 
this time the Ministry of Defense has been formed, the actual 
state of the Armed Forces has been analyzed, the concept of 
their building has been elaborated and approved by the 
president, directive instructions on combat and mobilization 
readiness and on operational and strategic planning have been 
drawn up, a number of legislative acts on military questions 
have been prepared.... 
  Nevertheless, as the president's message pointed out, the 
set 
tasks have been fulfilled in the Armed Forces. The reforms in 
the Armed Forces are going according to plan. If they had also 
been backed up with the necessary funding, I believe that many 
questions would have been resolved far more quickly. 
  In conclusion, one more figure: Since 7 May 1992 the 
authorized strength of the Armed Forces has been reduced by 
457,000 men.

  [Text] As of 1 January, the Russian Armed Forces officer 
corps was over 84 percent up to strength. This was stated by 
Colonel General Yevgeniy Vysotskiy, head of the Russian Defense 
Ministry's main personnel administration. 
  According to him, 34,000 fewer officers left the Army last 
year than in 1992. 
  Yevgeniy Vysotskiy pointed out that at present the decline 
in 
competition when applying to enter a military educational 
establishment gives cause for concern. Last year, the 
competition ratio was 1.4 applicants for every place.

Ministry, defense expenditure will remain virtually unchanged 
compared with last -- 20.4 percent of the overall volume of 
expenditure. At the same time financial support for the 
territories will grow substantially -- to 13.5 percent. This is 
connected with the transition to a new system of inter-relations 
between the center and the component parts of the Federation. 
But spending on sociocultural measures and science remain at 
the old level -- 2.2 percent.

military servicemen and participants in the Chernobyl cleanup 
operation). 
  The Finance Ministry also proposes that retiring officers be 
paid the equivalent of not 20 but only five salaries. 
  The Finance Ministry is planning to submit these proposals 
to 
today's government session devoted to approving the 1994 budget.

  [Text] Patriarch Aleksey II of Moscow and All Russia and 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev signed a joint statement on 
Wednesday, providing for the creation of a coordinating 
committee for cooperation between the armed forces and the 
Russian Orthodox Church aimed at reviving the spiritual and 
patriotic traditions in the army. 
  The military command and the church have been recommended to 
encourage priests to visit garrisons and organize educational 
religious conferences. 
  Aleksey II told journalists that the signing of this 
document 
was an event of great importance. "There are many believers 
among servicemen and we shall meet their spiritual needs," he 
said. 
  Grachev stated that since the formation of the Russian armed 
forces, its commanders established mutual understanding with the 
church. "The younger generation's spiritual education has never 
been so important before," he said. He also announced that in 
many garrisons commanders cooperated with priests. "In the time 
free from service many soldiers visit the church, while priests 
perform rites in the garrisons," he said.

  [Excerpts] Tallinn, Mar 02, BNS -- Estonia is considering 
changing the level of its delegation for negotiations with 
Russia and may even break off the talks because of Russia's 
unconstructive approach, Estonia's chief negotiator Ambassador 
Vaino Reinart said today at a press conference after the 17th 
round of talks. 
  The reason for this is the Russian delegation's announcement 
that the final deadline for the withdrawal of Russian troops 
from Estonia is still open and that the pullout continues 
according to a timetable approved in Moscow, which is known only 
to the Russian side. 
  Head of the Russian delegation, Ambassador Vasiliy Svirin 
said that Russia's promise to withdraw its troops by Aug. 31, 
made during the 15th round of talks in January, "is no longer 
the order of the day," since Estonia has failed to keep its 
earlier promises. [passage omitted] 
  Estonia's top negotiator said the government plans soon to 
address the issue of the future of the talks. 
  Svirin said Estonia's intention to change the level of the 
delegation or to break off the talks will cause "certain 
tensions" in Estonian-Russian relations. 
  "On March 1 we informed Estonia of the changes in the 
make-up 
of our delegation," the Russian diplomat said. "We included 
several deputy ministers in it, which shows our interest in the 
negotiations." 
  In the 17th round of talks Estonia again asked Russia to 
present a list of Russian citizens residing in Estonia. The 
proposal, regrettably, met with a refusal, Reinart said. 
  No progress was made on the border issue. The parties only 
agreed that the working groups on border and humanitarian issues 
would meet before the next round of talks to discuss citizenship 
problems. An agreement in principle was reached also on 
reviving a joint working group to address the issue of a 
juridical evaluation of Russia's annexation of Estonia in 1940. 
  The parties did not set a date for the next round of 
negotiations.

  [Text] Now a little about the Estonian-Russian talks. On 
the first day of the 17th round of Estonian-Russian talks 
yesterday [1 March], Ambassador Vasiliy Svirin, the leader of 
the Russian delegation, continued to link the withdrawal of 
2,600 Russian servicemen from Estonia with social guarantees for 
[Russian] military pensioners [living in Estonia]. Svirin told 
Estonian Television yesterday that Russia is prepared to present 
a schedule for troop withdrawal if Estonia agrees to sign an 
agreement concerning social guarantees for military pensioners 
and their family members. 
  The Estonian Foreign Ministry says in its statement today 
that such action is in conflict with UN and CSCE documents 
according to which Russia has taken upon herself the obligation 
of withdrawing her troops from Estonia unconditionally. 
Ambassador Vaino Reinart, the Estonian delegation leader, 
regrets that Russia wants to initial the two agreements as a 
single package. The Estonian delegation requested also an 
explanation for the statement made on 28 February by Aleksandr 
Udaltsev, a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official, on the 
first day of the talks. According to the statement, it is too 
soon to talk about the Russian troop withdrawal from Estonia by 
31 August of the current year. According to the Russian 
delegation, Udaltsev's position does not coincide with the 
official Russian position.

  [Text] The Estonian Foreign Ministry finds that the 2,600 
Russian servicemen deployed in Estonia act as a destabilizing 
force. Their discipline is weak and they have links with both 
the illegal arms trade and other crime. The Foreign Ministry 
statement says that the Estonian police are investigating 
several cases of Russian servicemen selling their arms to 
criminals locally. The Estonian police confiscated 500 
kilograms of a powerful explosive substance from a Russian 
junior officer in February 1993. It would have been sufficient 
to blow up the World Trade Center in New York. At the same 
location the police confiscated 12,000 cartridges that were 
intended for sale. 
  Two months ago the police found a train standing near the 
[training] nuclear reactor at Paldiski [Russian naval base near 
Tallinn], which had been unguarded since November. There were 
numerous anti-tank shells in its 22 cars. Local people had 
already succeeded in emptying several of the wagons and had sold 
their booty. According to the Foreign Ministry, it is assumed 
that the weapons are now held by criminals, BNS [Baltic News 
Service] notes.

  [Text] Russia has stated that the proposal that its troops 
be withdrawn from Estonia by 31 August has become redundant and 
that the troop withdrawal (?will continue) according to a 
timetable to be determined by the Russian side. Vasiliy Svirin, 
leader of the Russian delegation [at 17th round of 
Estonian-Russian talks], made a statement to this effect at a 
news conference today. Viewing the outcome of yet another round 
of talks between Estonia and Russia, Svirin said that they 
satisfy neither the Russian nor the Estonian side. For the 
Russian side the first priority is the situation of its 
compatriots in Estonia, but these issues were practically not 
even discussed because of the Estonian side's position. 
Explaining the change of view on the date for the withdrawal 
that was previously put forward by the Russian side, the Russian 
delegation leader said that this results from statements by the 
Estonian side (?which is now avoiding putting this in writing). 
Svirin mentioned the readiness to finance the building of 
housing for Russian servicemen, the giving up of mutual 
compensation, and the agreement ensuring social guarantees for 
retired Russian servicemen. 
  Speaking about the border between Estonia and Russia, Svirin 
said that the issue is clear for Russia: the border is where it 
runs at present. Estonia, however, is making territorial claims 
on Russia, Svirin claimed. Russia does not see it as possible 
to resolve the border issue through an international court. If 
the Estonian side does not wish to set down markers along the 
border Russia will do so unilaterally, Svirin added. At the 
same time Svirin stated that the Russian side intends to 
continue the talks in order to achieve friendly and [word 
indistinct]] cooperation and mutual understanding. 
  Commenting on the statement made by the leader of the 
Russian 
Federation's delegation at the news conference, Estonian 
delegation leader Vaino Reinart said that the Estonian side does 
not wish to break off the talks, either. The statement read out 
just now may, however, lead to the talks being broken off and 
Estonia changing her delegation [words indistinct]. Reinart 
noted that the Russian side did not agree to hand over to the 
Estonian side a list of Russian citizens living in Estonia, 
making a reference to [words indistinct]. Estonia proposed 
that on the subject of the Estonian-Russian border the 
International Court in The Hague should be approached. The 
Russian delegation rejected the proposal unambiguously, said 
Reinart. He went on to state that the Estonian Government is 
due to discuss the [word indistinct] outcome of the 17th round 
of talks in the near future.

  [Text] Negotiations between Estonia and Russia on the 
withdrawal of Russian troops have collapsed. This information 
was given by the Estonian foreign minister on his visit to 
Stockholm. 
  [Begin recording -- Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik, in 
English] The negotiations ended kind of in a, in a very smashing 
way, I mean they were not interrupted at the moment but there 
was a, there was a complete collapse. [end recording] 
  [Reporter] The negotiations collapsed totally, crash and 
bang, it was not just an interruption but instead the whole 
basis of the negotiations collapsed. This was said by Estonian 
Foreign Minister Juri Luik at a news conference a little while 
ago at the Swedish Foreign Ministry where he has today had 
negotiations with Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas. 
  The collapse in the talks on the Russian withdrawal came as 
a 
surprise; when the latest round started just outside Tallinn 
yesterday, nothing pointed toward that. The Estonian foreign 
minister expressed great disappointment today. The collapse is 
especially sad because we were more or less ready with an 
agreement that the last Russian troops -- there are currently 
only about 2,600 men -- will be withdrawn by 31 August this year 
at the latest, Juri Luik said. He added that the Estonian 
government will now consult their partners in the west, 
including the Scandinavian governments. 
  On behalf of the Swedish Government, Foreign Minister 
Margaretha af Ugglas deeply deplored what has happened now. 
  [Begin af Ugglas recording] I am reacting very strongly, 
Swedish opinion is quite clear: International law requires that 
Russia withdraw its troops from both Estonia and Latvia. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Maloveryan] </F>
  [Text] Tallinn March 2 TASS -- Estonia intends to take its 
territorial dispute with Russia to International Court of 
Justice in The Hague, said Vaino Reinart, head of the Estonian 
negotiating team to talks with Russia, the 17th round of which 
ended in Tallinn. In his words, "regarding the 1920 Tartu peace 
treaty as the only basis of its relations with Russia, Estonia 
insists that part of the present Leningrad and Pskov regions be 
given back to it". 
  Commenting on the results of the talks, Russian negotiating 
chief Vasiliy Svirin told reporters that his country was above 
all guided by the principle of inviolability of frontiers sealed 
by the Concluding Act of the 1975 Helsinki Conference. 
  As for the progress of Russian-Estonian talks on the whole, 
the heads of the two negotiating teams expressed dissatisfaction 
about their results. The agreement on troop withdrawal was 
never signed. The Russian side demands that security guarantees 
for military pensioners and members of their families form part 
of this agreement, while Estonia agrees to discuss this issue 
only upon presentation of a schedule for pulling out the 2,600 
Russian troops still staying on Estonian territory. 
  Apart from this, Svirin noted, the Russian delegation to the 
talks is concerned over Estonia's deviation from earlier signed 
agreements on mutual claims. Under these agreements, Russia is 
to transfer to the Baltic state 4,900 military installations on 
its territory, and Estonia is to refrain from any claims for 
ecological damage it incurred. Furthermore, Estonia is to 
allocate 23 million dollars for accommodating Russian servicemen 
leaving the republic. 
  Following Estonia's departure from these agreements, Svirin 
said, Russia will be forced to withdraw the remaining troops 
according to a schedule set by it unilaterally. This means that 
Russia may go back on the earlier fixed deadline for troop 
pullout, August 31, 1994. And by accusing Russia of "not a 
constructive stand", the Estonian side dragging out negotiations 
or, in Reinart's words, upgrades their level.

  [Text] Tartu, Estonia, Mar 02, BNS -- The relations 
between Estonia and Russia are likely to become even more 
strained, since nothing good can be expected from the present 
make-up of the Russian parliament, Vello Saatpalu, head of the 
parliamentary Foreign Affairs Commission, said at a press 
conference in Tartu today. 
  Saatpalu said he would have been surprised if Russia had 
stuck to its earlier promise to withdraw the troops from Estonia 
by Aug. 31. 
  "I'm aware that nobody can come up with solutions to the 
problems of the troop withdrawal," he said. 
  Commenting on the debates about the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty, 
Saatpalu said he doesn't know any force "that would make Russia 
recognize the validity of the treaty." 
  "Estonia has two options to get back five percent of its 
territory: it can either declare war on Russia or seek out 
political forces that would make clear to Russia the advantages 
of returning Estonian lands it currently holds," Saatpalu said. 
  The commission chairman sees two possible solutions also to 
the problem of Russian military pensioners: they can be either 
deported or convinced of the profitability of returning to 
Russia. Saatpalu considers it unlikely, however, that any of 
the non-Estonians will voluntarily leave Estonia. 
  "It may be different if they get paid for it," he said. 
  Saatpalu voiced his conviction that Russia will not achieve 
its objectives in issues related to the pensioned military. 
  "Since Estonian laws stipulate that they must leave, any 
compromises on this issue are ruled out," he maintained. 
  Saatpalu announced that members of the foreign affairs 
commissions of the Russian State Duma and the Estonian 
parliament will get together in the first half of the year.

  [Text] The delay of a monetary union with Russia just plays 
into the hands of opponents to such an agreement, Prime Minister 
of Belarus Vyacheslav Kebich told INTERFAX. 
  In his view, the procrastination is not to the benefit of 
the 
Belarussian economy because the plants have started to "hold 
back" to Russian rubles and default on fuel payment. In the 
meantime, he said, union opponents on both sides have launched a 
debate on how "one state is trying to cheat the other."

<F P=106> [Interview with Mechyslaw Hryb, chairman of the Belarus </F>
Supreme Soviet, by Aleksey Zhuk; place and date not given -- 
live or recorded; from the "Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Zhuk] The Belarus Parliament today confirmed the 
results of voting by named ballot [the voter's name is on the 
ballot slip] on the basic sections of the draft new 
constitution. The deputies thus approved the institution of a 
presidential republic. Does this mean moving to the next stage 
now -- that is, to elections of the future leader of the state 
and head of executive power in the republic? 
  [Hryb] No. It does not mean yet that Belarus will have a 
presidency, because these sections which have been voted on by 
named ballot will be part of the section on the constitution. 
And only when we adopt the constitution as a whole and 
determine, adopt a resolution on the procedure for bringing it 
into effect will this section, that is, the one on introducing a 
presidency, come into force. If we do not adopt the 
constitution in the Supreme Soviet, I will use my right to 
submit this question to a national referendum.

  [Text] The opposition of the Belarusian Popular Front in 
the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus has made a 
statement that the voting on certain articles of the new 
Constitution was conducted in a manner that infringed on voting 
procedures. In particular, according to the opposition, the 
continuity of voting was broken. The Supreme Soviet also 
infringed on the procedures by refusing to vote on an 
alternative version of the draft law on the political system, 
which was proposed by the opposition. "This attempt to 
introduce presidential rule in Belarus in an illegal way cannot 
be tolerated by us," stated the opposition deputies (40 
persons). "It leads to a dictatorship." By the way, the 
opposition did not participate [passage indistinct]. 
  The former chairman of the Belarusian parliament, Stanislav 
Shushkevich, called the roll-call voting procedure with regard 
to constitutional articles a deception of the people.

  [Text] In his interview with INTERFAX, Vladimir Zametalin, 
press secretary of the Belarusian prime minister, accused the 
Russian bloc Russia's Choice of striving "to prevent unification 
of Slavic peoples." In his words, "hysteria stirred by the 
opposition Russia's Choice" is the major hindrance on the way to 
unification of Belarus' and Russia's monetary systems and 
further integration of these two Slavic states. 
  Zametalin is convinced that by preventing creation of a 
monetary union, "the Gaydar-Fedorov bloc is fulfilling the order 
of their behind-the-ocean patrons who are concerned over 
Russia's entering the geopolitical arena." 
  Meanwhile, according to Zametalin, Moscow "sees the way out 
of the crisis at the expense of strengthening of integration 
ties with young Slavic states as well." 
  He expressed opinion that "strengthening of Russia's 
positions on international arena and possible unification of 
Belarus and Russia will put an end to the West's monopoly in 
determining priorities in mutual relations between world 
community states which has established over the last period of 
time." 
  Responding to the question whether the delay in signing of 
the Belarusian-Russian documents on creation of a monetary union 
affects the situation in Belarus economy, Zametalin pointed out 
that over the last few months the situation in the republic "is 
characterized by substantial lowering of businesslike activity." 
In his words, entrepreneurs do not risk to take "serious 
credits due to uncertainty, to be or not to be for the union 
and, if yes, then what will be the exchange rate of the 
Belarusian ruble to the Russian one." 
  "There is artificial manipulation in the increase of the 
Russian ruble to a hair" (a common name for the Belarusian ruble 
-- INTERFAX) underlined Zametalin. To reaffirm his words, he 
mentioned the fact of the exchange rate growth of 1.5 over the 
last months. "There is more policy than sound financial and 
economic sense in the increasing discrepancy of two monetary 
systems," believes Zametalin. At the same time he "does not rule 
out the possibility that such a situation in the financial 
sphere is being created by special adversaries of monetary 
systems' unification in order to get rich at the expense of 
variance in exchange rates."

  [Text] The preparation of documents forming the basis of 
the merger of the money systems of the Republic of Belarus and 
Russia is virtually complete. As BELINFORM was told by 
Uladzimir Zamyatalin, the Belarusian prime minister's press 
secretary, the political brakes that are hindering the creation 
of an economic and ruble union between Belarus and Russia should 
probably be looked for not in Moscow, far less in Minsk. 
  It is not impossible that the process is being influenced by 
serious concern at the latest development of the Slav factor on 
the part of the trans-Atlantic Sovietologists shocked by the 
successful renaissance of Russia's foreign policy actions in 
Bosnia. This process, in the opinion of Zamyatalin, is so far 
being brilliantly frozen by the nationalist Russophobes in Minsk 
and the Russia's Choice people in Moscow. Their latest 
alliance, stressed Zamyatalin, is conditioned evidently by one 
aim -- not to permit any Slav merger. The integration process 
of Russia and Belarus, considers the press secretary, can be 
interrupted only artificially, but in that event the material 
and moral cost of the inevitable merger of the two peoples will 
be considerably higher.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mechyslaw Hryb, chairman of the Republic of </F>
Belarus Supreme Soviet, by Oleg Stepanenko in Minsk, date not 
given: "Mechyslaw Hryb: `We Will Build a Just Society'"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- Mechyslaw Ivanovich Hryb was born in 
September 1938 in the village of Savichi in Grodno Oblast. He 
is Belarusian. His father died at the front in the Great 
Patriotic War. 
  He is a professional lawyer and graduated from the Law 
Department at the Belarusian State University, specializing in 
jurisprudence. He worked in the republic's law-enforcement 
organs and in 1985 became head of the Vitebsk Oblast Soviet 
Executive Committee Internal Affairs Administration. He is a 
militia lieutenant general in the reserve. 
  In 1990 he became a people's deputy and member of the 
Republic of Belarus Supreme Soviet Presidium and chairman of the 
Supreme Soviet's Commission on National Security, Defense, and 
Combating Crime. His wife is an accountant. They have two 
children: Their son is a doctor, their daughter a student. 
  On 28 January 1994 he was elected chairman of the Republic 
of 
Belarus Supreme Soviet. 
  One hour before the results of the second round of voting 
were announced, I approached him in the foyer where deputies 
were waiting for the verdict of the tellers' commission. "It is 
tempting providence to congratulate you on your victory, 
Mechyslaw Ivanovich." "It is hard to say what is better," he 
replied, pensively. "My wife has not spoken to me since she 
heard what kind of harness I am putting my head into." Indeed, 
Mechyslaw Hryb himself immediately refused point-blank to allow 
his nomination to be put forward. The members of the presidium 
met and spent half a day trying to persuade him. 
  Now the scene shifts to the office of the chairman of the 
republic's Supreme Soviet where our conversation took place and 
my first question was this: 
  [Stepanenko] So, is it a case of congratulations or 
commiserations? 
  [Hryb] Commiserations would be better -- such a burden, and 
at such a time. 
  [Stepanenko] The impression gained from your first 
interviews and speeches as chairman are unambiguous: You are 
fully aware of how hard it is to extricate the republic from the 
crisis into which it has been plunged in the past two years. In 
your view, what are the reasons for this crisis and what are its 
true dimensions? 
  [Hryb] When assessing any phenomenon I usually rely on 
objective data. On things that can be compared and calculated. 
For example, in the past two years national income has fallen by 
20 percent. And although the rate of decline is much less than 
in other countries of the CIS and the Baltic region which are 
former republics of the USSR -- its scale is awesome. 
  If you consider that back in 1989 the national income growth 
rate was 8 percent and was perhaps the highest in the world, it 
is not hard to see that the calamity which was building up is 
hitting us particularly hard here. 
  The main cause of the crisis is undoubtedly the breakdown of 
the ties which permeated the vital economic organism. The 
destruction of production-sharing dealt the republic a heavy 
blow. Belarus, as you are aware, was known as the assembly shop 
of the Union: machine building, electronics, chemicals, and 
other sectors of industry manufactured end products here using 
components and raw materials received from many republics. We 
received 70-80 percent, in some cases the full 100 percent, of 
our oil, gas, and metals, for example, mainly from Russia. 
After the disintegration of the USSR the volumes of those 
supplies fell sharply and prices rose incredibly. Furthermore, 
prices of oil and gas for our enterprises were four times higher 
than for Russian enterprises. Added to that there were customs 
duties, which raised prices by a third. That is the reason for 
the slump in production, the explosion of inflation, and the 
further decline in the living standard. 
  [Stepanenko] All these are external factors, as it were. 
But there were internal ones, were there not? 
  [Hryb] Of course. I have said a number of times that in the 
process of perestroyka and reform we lost control of the 
republic. The old party-state system was destroyed, but a new 
system of management was not created. This aggravated all the 
negative processes. The growth of crime, speculation, 
corruption; the opportunity for the unearned fast buck, which 
demoralizes socially inexperienced youth above all and 
undermines society's future; the iniquitous enrichment of some 
against the background and at the expense of the impoverishment 
of a considerable section of the people; the erosion of the 
moral principles and values inherent in our people since time 
immemorial -- all these factors jeopardize society's stability. 
  [Stepanenko] What do you intend to do to rectify such an 
explosive situation? 
  [Hryb] I intend to use all the strength, experience, and 
ability that it takes to eliminate the causes of the crisis. As 
for the external causes, it is necessary first of all to 
immediately rebuild the wrecked economic ties with the former 
republics of the USSR. Especially with Russia. As I have 
already remarked a number of times, the situation can only be 
remedied by an economic union and a singe monetary system -- 
measures, I stress, which are exceptionally effective and 
mutually beneficial. Despite the resistance of the opponents of 
such integration, a contractual basis for the single monetary 
system has been prepared and, I hope, will be adopted in the 
near future. 
  [Stepanenko] What about the elimination of the internal 
causes? 
  [Hryb] Briefly, it is necessary to restore the government of 
the republic. As quickly as possible, furthermore. 
  [Stepanenko] What is being done to achieve that? 
  [Hryb] As I promised right after the election, I am trying 
to take every measure to unite deputies and the presidium as far 
as possible. Unless consolidation is achieved at the top, not 
one of the tasks aimed at creating an effective system of 
government will be accomplished. And there are a great many 
tasks of that kind. Of course, some of them are more important 
than the rest, and unless these are resolved we cannot even hope 
to find a way out of the crisis. The most important thing 
today, in my view, is to define the form in which the state is 
to be organized. Belarus and Tajikistan are the only former 
USSR republics not to have done that yet. 
  The other day, as you know, the Supreme Soviet Presidium 
issued a statement which set out what are in our view the main 
measures involved in building and equipping the state. First it 
is necessary to institute the post of the supreme official who 
is to be elected by all the people and who is at the same time 
the leader of the state and the executive. In our opinion, this 
will ensure personal responsibility for the state of affairs in 
the republic. In addition, it is necessary to define in law the 
appropriate system of state organs to ensure the observance of 
citizens' rights, the efficient development of the economy, 
effective management, control, legality, and law and order. 
During this very session we must work to adopt a new 
constitution and hold nationwide elections of state and 
executive branch leaders in the first half of the year, 
elections to the Supreme Soviet in the second half of the year, 
and elections to the local soviets in March next year. We are 
convinced that in this way the continuity of power and stability 
in society and the participation of the whole population in the 
renewal of the state organs will be ensured on the basis of the 
laws. 
  [Stepanenko] Mechyslaw Ivanovich, not everyone supports this 
program, as we know. Let us begin with the intention of uniting 
the deputies. The views, approaches, and programs of those who 
belong to communist deputies' formations, the People's Movement 
of Belarus (PMB), for example, and the Belarusian People's Front 
(BPF), conflict on the fundamental questions of socioeconomic 
organization and policy. The former, for example, support a 
union with Russia, the BPF is against. Uniting them, combining 
the uncombinable -- do you not think that this is idealism, 
romanticism, a utopia, if you like? 
  [Hryb] I am not so naive as to fail to understand that it is 
impossible, of course, to try to consolidate and unite the 
forces of the communists and the BPF, for example. But I do 
think it realistic to try to unite them to resolve a specific 
task. You only have to reason and try to convince them -- they 
are living people and, believe me, they do listen when people 
speak to them and try to convince them by means of arguments. 
We, too, must listen, consider, and accept all of our 
opponents' reasonable suggestions. Unity has been achieved on a 
number of questions of building and equipping the state, and 
both the communists and the representatives of the BPF voted for 
many articles in the new constitution which have now been 
adopted. 
  [Stepanenko] Suppose, Mechyslaw Ivanovich, that you do 
manage to achieve a certain consolidation of the deputies, 
nevertheless a unification within the political hierarchy which 
divides people and society from below (and that, after all, is 
the only outcome of a course of market reforms aimed at 
capitalization) will not lead to stabilization, peace, reliable 
manageability, or accord. For example, who is going to agree to 
latter-day capitalists becoming rich at other people's expense? 
Clearly what is needed first is a concept of a socioeconomic 
arrangement which unites people, is it not? 
  [Hryb] We do not need to build capitalism and we will not 
build it, even if only because with our people we will not reach 
capitalism, we will not succeed in building it. 
  [Stepanenko] The supporters of capitalization are touting 
this idea of yours around everywhere, Mechyslaw Ivanovich: Hryb 
himself has said that you will not build capitalism with our 
people: They are the wrong people, bad people. 
  [Hryb] Why are they "bad"? It is simply that we are by 
nature somewhat different, we have a different mentality. The 
Belarusians, the Russians -- the Slavs -- and indeed not only 
the Slavs but everyone who has lived on the territory of the 
former Soviet Union, the majority of these people have a 
different inner, spiritual core. It is based on a desire for 
justice, the struggle for justice, and a belief in the triumph 
of a justice with which the principles of "buy and sell" and 
"make as much money as you can" are incompatible. Just like the 
principle of dividing and judging people according to capital 
and wealth. 
  [Stepanenko] When addressing the first session of the 
presidium after your election as chairman of the Supreme Soviet 
Presidium you cited a purely worldly example: Before laying a 
road, the smart administrator first looks to see which way 
people tend to go and only then starts laying the asphalt. 
  [Hryb] Yes, that is one of my main principles, people will 
not get it wrong, believe me. My greatest faith is in people, 
in the fact that they will work things out for themselves and 
decide for themselves how they should live. I am convinced that 
we have still not made any major or irreversible mistakes and 
have taken a balanced approach to the reform of the economy. I 
am a convinced supporter of the need to reform the old economic 
system. It was too restrictive and to a large extent tended 
toward a leveling approach. Everything was dictated from the 
top. Neither collectives nor individual workers had scope for 
development. People were suppressed, the level of wages was 
restricted. Just exceed that restrictive limit a little and 
immediately they revise the norms and the rates. 
  But we need to give the producer and the worker freedom. Of 
course, that freedom must not harm others or society. 
  [Stepanenko] You are a supporter of the presidential form of 
rule, but many people, including a section of the deputies, are 
opposed to it. I have just had a call from a reader who cited 
some lines from a newspaper report: "The institution of the 
presidency tore our Union to shreds. Each president, great or 
small, took pains to organize his own little nest and promised 
the people an abundance of 'golden eggs.' We know what the 
result of that was. Moreover, it cannot be ignored that 
presidential rule tends more toward an individualist rather than 
a collectivist psychology...." 
  [Hryb] I beg to differ. In the first place, I do not 
believe that it was presidential rule which led to the 
disintegration of the Union.... In the second place, there was 
a president in the USSR even before perestroyka. Only in those 
days he was called a general secretary. I am convinced that, 
now that governability has been almost completely lost, such an 
instrument is needed. 
  [Stepanenko] What about a parliamentary republic? People's 
power in the form of the soviets? 
  [Hryb] Soviet power as a form of popular representation 
after the appropriate improvement, and its supreme organ -- the 
Supreme Soviet -- remain and will exercise their functions in 
close cooperation with the president. 
  [Stepanenko] Many are convinced that before adopting the 
constitution it is necessary to decide on a sociopolitical and 
economic structure. That it is necessary to begin not with the 
roof but with the foundations. 
  [Hryb] I can understand them but I cannot agree with them. 
While we are making up our minds there will be nothing left of 
the roof but fragments. In a society out of control only one 
type of process -- a destructive one -- is possible, and for 
that reason the most important thing is to establish a firm 
vertical administrative structure, that is my opinion, my 
conviction. 
  [Stepanenko] The draft of the new constitution stresses 
the priority of human rights over the rights of the state. The 
supporters of that approach assert that this is how things are 
in all rule-of-law states in the West.... But is the 
absolutization of human rights in our country not one of the 
causes of chaos? 
  [Hryb] We have lived through the stage of "thinking about 
the motherland first, yourself afterward." They were good 
words, a fine idea, but we remember what resulted from the 
disfigured absolutization of this idea. When a person could not 
leave the village unless the chief gave him a reference, when he 
could not take someone who had offended him to court or to the 
executive committee or any other organ of power. 
  [Stepanenko] But those were distortions. 
  [Hryb] Yes, but the soil for such distortions existed. I 
believe that human rights must be defined as a priority in the 
constitution. But in conjunction with obligations. Obligations 
to society, the state, and other citizens. When we organically 
combine all these factors, there manifests itself an integral 
state structure in which no one will be able to shelter behind 
the freedoms and rights of the individual to harm another 
person, the collective, or society. 
  [Stepanenko] I would like to thank you for this frank 
conversation and congratulate you on behalf of myself and my 
PRAVDA comrades on your election to this supreme state post. 
And of course to wish you success in your difficult state work. 
  [Stepanenko] Thank you, and I also wish PRAVDA and its 
staffers new successes.

<F P=106> [Sergey Vaganov report: "Belarus: Social Democrats </F>
Protest"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- Human rights are being violated in Belarus. 
This was stated by representatives of the Social Democratic 
parties of Belarus, Germany, Latvia, Russia, Lithuania, Sweden, 
and Estonia who participated in an international conference held 
in Minsk on basic questions of social policy and economic 
management in Belarus and neighboring countries. 
  A statement cites facts of judicial and administrative 
persecution of the organizers of a political strike demanding 
early parliamentary elections, the resignation of the present 
government, and the formation of a transitional government. 
After 15 February, when rallies and demonstrations were held in 
Minsk and other cities, many of their participants were 
arrested, fined, and summoned to appear in court. The 
authorities regarded the actions of the strike committees and of 
the Belarusian free trade union as a call for a violent change 
in the state system. A protest, which is fully justified under 
conditions of an economic and political crisis, is described as 
an attempt to overthrow the power structures. All this, the 
statement reads, as well as the restrictions on free speech and 
the rigid control over the mass media, constitutes an offensive 
against human rights.

  [Text] At a session of the Saeima foreign affairs 
commission today, Martins Virsis, the parliamentary secretary at 
the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the head of the 
Latvian delegation for talks with Russia, viewed the blowing up 
of a high-tension power line near Skrunda as an incident of a 
political nature, stressing its advantage to Russia. As Virsis 
said, incidents of this kind are to the benefit of Russia to 
justify to the world and especially the United States its 
military interests in Latvia. In addition, Virsis expressed 
indignation at the performance of the Latvian security service, 
which did not provide government departments with the necessary 
information immediately after the incident. 
  Power was reconnected to the damaged high-tension line after 
the completion of restoration work at 2104 yesterday.

<F P=106> [Article by Liga Laizane: "Inhabitants of Skrunda Do Not </F>
Want Radar Station To Operate for Four More Years"] 
  [Excerpts] Riga, 16 Feb -- Authorities of the villages 
situated in the area of the Skrunda radar station are 
dissatisfied with the government's intention to sign an 
agreement with Russia whereby the station will continue 
operation for another four years, followed by an additional 18 
months to dismantle the installation. Today, at a session of 
the people's deputies in the House of Culture in Skrunda, in 
which local inhabitants took part, a decision was made to ask 
the Latvian Government to ensure that the functioning of the 
radar base be ended at the same time as the foreign army 
withdrawal is completed. 
  This decision was accepted notwithstanding the explanations 
of Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs, leader of the Latvia's Way 
Faction Andreys Panteleyevs, or the Minister for Special Tasks 
Edvins Inkens, who tried to persuade the citizens that Latvia 
would only gain if the agreement was signed and there would be a 
precise time set for the radar station to cease operations. 
  A. Panteleyevs said that if the agreement would meet the 
requirements of the Latvian Government, it would contain a point 
stating that the facility should be dismantled immediately after 
the agreement is concluded. The old radar has gone out of date 
and it is not foreseen that it could be operated for more than 
four years. During this period, everything should be done to 
make Russia invest money in building a radar station in 
Baranoviche, in Belarus. 
  V. Birkavs emphasized in his turn, that by signing this 
agreement Latvia could integrate quicker into Europe. He said 
advantage should be taken of the support of European 
international organizations -- the prime minister mentioned in 
particular the friendly attitude toward Latvia of the leaders of 
the Western European Union -- to conclude the agreement with 
Russia. V. Birkavs also reported what he had learned during his 
visit to the United States -- there is great interest concerning 
the Skrunda radar base, yet the leaders of foreign countries 
usually do not give concrete advice; such advice must be found 
by the Latvian Government itself. 
  E. Inkens explained that the agreement would make it 
possible 
to more effectively control the functioning of the radar 
station. Currently, there is no such possibility to do this. 
Answering questions from the citizens gathered, V. Birkavs 
reported that Denmark has promised to send concrete material aid 
as well as its experts to control the environmental situation in 
Skrunda. [passage omitted] 
  Specifying the facts due to which the Skrunda station ought 
to be closed immediately, in addition to those already known -- 
such as a greater instance of diseases among inhabitants than 
anywhere else, especially children, the negative influence upon 
the environment, and pollution -- the inspector for environment 
protection Igo Midrian also mentioned the great amount of freon 
which is used in the station's cold storage plants. This could 
create complications for Latvia when it ratifies the Montreal 
convention on ozone protection. Therefore, the agreement should 
foresee a clause stating that freon used by the radar station be 
put on the account of Russia. 
  The inhabitants also expressed their dissatisfaction 
concerning the amount of compensation -- $2 million. According 
to them, the sum is too small. They also expressed a view that 
it is necessary to establish a special local medical center, 
because according to the head doctor at Skrunda hospital, 
Martins Abolins, diseases in this region have a more serious 
nature than in other areas of Latvia. V. Birkavs made a promise 
that the entire amount of the obtained compensation will be used 
to meet the needs of the inhabitants of the area effected by the 
radar station. He also allowed for the possibility that 
inhabitants who feel that their health is endangered be provided 
with a place to live outside of the area for the next four years. 
  The operation of the Skrunda radar station is being felt in 
the area of Skrunda, as well as in the villages of Ranki, Laida, 
Rudbarzi, Snepele, Nikraca, and Turlava, including Kuldiga, 
which has 40,000 inhabitants.

<F P=106> [Interview with Martins Virsis, parliamentary secretary of </F>
the Latvian Foreign Affairs Ministry and chief negotiator on 
Russian troop withdrawal, by Aivars Ozolins; place and date not 
given: "We Have No Wish To Prolong It" --] 
  [Excerpts] [Ozolins]In this round of negotiations, 
neither the final agreement nor any other documents were 
initialed or signed, as was foreseen by both Russia and Latvia. 
What were the reasons for this? 
  [Virsis] We could not manage to find a common language on 
some principal positions. First, regarding payments, second -- 
the social security of Russian Army pensioners. 
  I would not say that the situation is tragic or dramatic. To 
move forward on these issues, both sides must change their 
instructions and positions. 
  [Ozolins]Is it a question of extending their 
powers? 
  [Virsis] Either extending them or providing different 
instructions. It does not concern us so much as it does the 
Russians; still, the Russians might think quite the opposite. 
  [Ozolins]Does it mean that the Russian delegation is 
not authorized to agree with the change in the amount of the 
payment? 
  [Virsis] It is apparent that [Russian chief negotiator] 
Zotov 
does not have such power. Naturally the way in which he 
explains it all -- why he can not, what is the balance of 
payments, that there is $4.5 billion left over -- this is their 
interpretation. Everybody has a right to express their opinion, 
but in this concrete situation, this is not a correct proposal. 
It is very difficult for us to permit the continued operation 
of the Skrunda radar station for another four years, and what we 
are talking about is not rent for the land, but direct usage of 
this facility. 
  [Ozolins]In an interview with SM-SEGODNIA [as 
published], Zotov maintains that this agreement is probably more 
necessary for Latvia than for Russia, and that Russia is 
actually not interested in signing it any more. Could you 
comment on this? 
  [Virsis] He did not say this to me. One may say different 
things when speaking to journalists, and something else when 
speaking officially. If this is the official position of 
Russia, then there would really be no point in continuing our 
talks. 
  [Ozolins]In Zotov's view, much more important is the 
problem of ensuring the social security of retired military 
personnel. 
  [Virsis] I think there are no grounds for such a linking of 
issues -- either Skrunda or military pensioners. 
  Such an attitude on the part of Russia has developed 
historically. Since the beginning of the negotiations, Russia 
has consistently maintained these demands for the two agreements 
-- on social security of military personnel, and social security 
of war pensioners. At first, they were part of the main 
agreement. Later, to move forward with the main agreement, they 
were separated. 
  From this point of view, they are connected with the process 
of military withdrawal, however they can by no means be 
connected with Skrunda. 
  [Ozolins]What kind of a compromise would Latvia be 
inclined to accept concerning the military pensioners? What are 
Latvia's demands? 
  [Virsis] Regarding military pensioners who have permanent 
registration and who therefore are living as permanent 
residents, it is a question of their choice -- whether they wish 
to become Latvian citizens and, in this case, they will have to 
go through the respective procedure foreseen by Latvian 
legislation, or if they wish something else. In the latter case, 
it will be a matter of Latvian laws concerning the stay of 
foreigners or stateless persons. The problem of military 
personnel who were retired later or arranged their stay during 
the last two years, will be more complicated. 
  [Ozolins]Is the number of these people known? 
  [Virsis] Different numbers are given. The Northwestern Army 
Group has the most precise information. We can speak about 420 
people who have stayed here since 28 January 1992, when Russia 
took the Soviet Army under its jurisdiction. During this 
period, 2,800 were demobilized. At the same time, 2,500 officers 
left Latvia -- but I do not know how many of them were those who 
were demobilized. If these figures are true, than the above 
mentioned figure of 420 might be correct. The only question is 
-- whether the 2,500 people included those who were demobilized 
after 28 January 1992, because there is a possibility that those 
who were demobilized earlier could also leave. 
  [Ozolins]Can we say that Russian foreign policy towards 
the Baltic states has undergone a change, taking into account, 
for instance, the statements made by Zotov in the beginning of 
February in IZVESTIYA, in which he expressed a much more 
aggressive attitude towards the Baltic states, using the 
opportunity of the incident between Rucs and the generals. 
  [Virsis] In my opinion, the general attitude, since 
September 
1991, though not expressed clearly, arises from the regret that 
the Baltic states are gone. This attitude has always existed, 
but it is being more and more stressed, defined, and specified 
recently, the accents are emphasized more clearly and are 
becoming more comprehensive for us, as well as for the Russian 
people and the Western world. 
  [Ozolins]Do you think that these accents could become 
stronger and turn into a definite policy? 
  [Virsis] It is difficult to predict it, but it is possible 
that things will develop that way. 
  [Ozolins]Do you find the present interest in the 
security of the Baltic region shown by the Western countries 
short- lived? As soon as the agreement is concluded, the 
interest will die and we shall be left again, eye-to-eye with 
Russia. 
  [Virsis] It is provided by us in the agreement that 
regarding 
Skrunda, first of all, the CSCE will be the institution to 
oversee its fulfillment. This means control, inspection, 
sometimes extra inspections if necessary. We should not think 
that we will be left alone. Of course, it was clear from the 
beginning that in terms of security guarantees from Western 
countries, we could expect such guarantees from none of them, 
regardless of how powerful they are. Besides, the bigger the 
distance from that country to the one that is seeking 
guarantees, the more difficult the realization of the guarantees 
would be. The best example would be Great Britain and Poland in 
September 1939. There were guarantees, but they could not be 
fulfilled. Therefore the question now does not concern direct 
guarantees, but the political "texture" which is being "woven" 
right now and in which elements of our security are also 
designed. It is very delicate as yet, but it can be developed 
further. 
  It may seem paradoxical, but if not for the complicated 
situation with Skrunda... 
  [Ozolins]There would be less interest in us? 
  [Virsis] These were not my words exactly. Nevertheless, this 
could be one of reasons why the global powers and NATO -- and 
not only NATO -- should watch northeastern Europe more 
intensively. I do not want to single out Latvia, because it 
also applies to Estonia and Lithuania, as well as to our 
Scandinavian friends. Therefore, I shall cite Mao, who taught 
us that some value can be gained even from an unhappy situation. 
  [Ozolins]The supervision of CSCE is very important, but 
most probably the attitude of the global powers will be crucial. 
Do you think they will maintain their interest for all four 
years and eighteen months? 
  [Virsis] I hope very much that their interest will not be 
the 
same as it is now. At present, we see them in a very "pressed" 
situation. Many problems have yet to be resolved. In my 
opinion, the United States and the EC are interested in our 
settling the agreement with Russia, because it will allow us to 
integrate more quickly in Europe. This is really the only 
normal way to maintain their interest in security issues. One 
has to remember that the EC is not entirely a political or 
economic organization. 
  This is simply a very tense and painful period in our 
relations with Russia. At the same time, the EC has already 
worked out some conditions of our movement toward integration, 
but surely they would be more definite and positive if our 
relations with Russia were regulated by an agreement. 
  (Ozolins]Do foresee a possibility -- at least 
theoretically -- that we could be accepted to NATO even with the 
Skrunda radar station? 
  [Virsis] No. Of course this is only my personal view. It 
may turn out another way. 
  [Ozolins]So at least six years must pass before we will 
be able to speak seriously about joining this organization? 
  [Virsis] There are also other political institutions for 
security. First of all, the Western European Union, to which 
Latvia and other Baltic and East European states belong as 
members of its consultative forum, but we can become associated 
members. It is a small but very heavy "brick." It is not NATO, 
but very near it. [passage omitted] 
  [Ozolins]When could the agreement with Russia be 
signed? 
  [Virsis] [passage omitted] Speaking about Latvia's attitude, 
we are not the ones that are in the mood to prolong it. 
  [Ozolins]But this is just what Zotov accuses -- that we 
are dragging our feet. 
  [Virsis] The interpretations of Mr. Zotov are also 
meaningful. He is a professional diplomat. I am a professional 
historian. I am fixing dates and facts, he interprets them.

  [Text] Approximately 200 Russian Army units have been 
disbanded on Latvian territory over the last year. Some of the 
discharged officers have left for Russia, but others have 
remained in Latvia. The Command of the Northwestern Group of 
Russian Forces does not provide the Latvian Bureau for 
Monitoring the Withdrawal of the Russian Army with information 
about officers who, after the disbandment of military units, 
have remained in Latvia, Ilgonis Upmalis, the head of the 
bureau, reports. 
  The Bureau for Monitoring the Withdrawal of the Russian Army 
has instructed local governments to collect information about 
officers of the disbanded military units, who were discharged in 
Latvia. However, this is a very long and labor-consuming 
process. This issue is not being considered at the 
Latvian-Russian interstate talks on troop withdrawal either.

soldiers were taken to Riga war hospital in February or March 
this year, Igors Golins, Russian West-East army unit's press 
center head, told BNS denying the agency ITAR-TASS information 
published Tuesday [1 March] in newspaper PANORAMA LATVIJI. 
  ITAR-TASS declares that the North-West army unit leadership 
announced about the case of beaten up Russian soldiers to 
Latvian Foreign Ministry but Golins denies it. Ivars Embrekts, 
Latvian Foreign Ministry press secretary also affirmed that the 
ministry has received no announcements from North-West army 
unit's leadership. 
  North-West army unit's medical center chief informed Golin 
that no journalists have spoken neither with the leadership of 
medical center nor soldiers undergoing treatment at Riga war 
hospital. 
  Golin said he has no idea where the wrong information came 
from and noted that the leadership of North-West army unit will 
officially deny it in the near future.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 02, BNS -- The Lithuanian prosecutor's 
office intends to carry out "a thorough investigation" of the 
failed arrest of Vitali Yegorov, who is accused of inspiring 
anti-state activities in the Lithuanian seaport of Klaipeda 
during the 1991 Soviet coup. 
  Lithuanian authorities planned to arrest Yegorov in his 
Klaipeda apartment but the suspect was reportedly warned about 
the operation and managed to slip away. 
  The prosecutor's office said the failed operation was 
carried 
out by the Lithuanian National Security Service. 
  Kestutis Betingis, head of the State Crimes Department, told 
the RESPUBLIKA newspaper that he will officially demand to 
dismiss some employees of the service. 
  Betingis supposes that Yegorov may have been either arrested 
on Friday [25 February] and then released, or was informed about 
the operation in advance. 
  The official said this was "an open betrayal" or simply 
unsuccessful work, but "somebody did this on purpose." 
  Prosecutor General Arturas Paulauskas confirmed to 
RESPUBLIKA 
that the head of the security service, Jurgis Jurgelis, 
telephoned him several times before the operation and tried to 
convince the prosecutor not to arrest Yegorov. Jurgelis 
reportedly said "how will we look politically" if a former 
Soviet serviceman is arrested. 
  Jurgelis is on sick-leave since Monday, his secretary said. 
  In 1991, Colonel Yegorov headed the military-political 
section of the Soviet coast guard division stationed in 
Klaipeda. The prosecutor's office found evidence that he 
initiated unlawful actions of the Soviet military during the 
1991 coup.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 02, BNS -- Lithuania has nothing to 
conceal from Israel, Justas Paleckis, the Lithuanian president's 
foreign policy adviser, said commenting on reports that Israel 
is unsatisfied with the imaginary hostility of Lithuanians 
toward Jews. 
  Apart from publications in the Israeli press, Reuters 
recently quoted Israel's Justice Minister David Libai as saying 
that "the Lithuanian government must bear responsibility for 
punishing war criminals and returning Jewish property stolen and 
confiscated in World War II." 
  The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry is still trying to obtain 
the 
official text of the Israeli minister's statement, but did not 
have it as of noon Wednesday. 
  In an interview with Lithuanian TV, Paleckis said relations 
with Israel must be based on the future as it is done in 
relations with Russia, Germany, Poland and other countries, but 
not on the past. "There is every possibility to have very good 
relations with Israel." 
  Vidmantas Vaicekauskas, senior investigator of the 
Lithuanian 
Prosecutor General's Office, said "this soap bubble about the 
lawfulness of rehabilitation is only a pretext,...,everything 
lies in property problems of Jews." 
  Restitution in Lithuania is applied only to Lithuanian 
citizens who permanently live in the country. 
  Vaicekauskas said the Lithuanian legislation does not 
provide 
for a possibility to open a branch office of the Simon Wiesental 
Center in Lithuania because it is "a social organization of a 
foreign state."

  [Excerpt] Five press conferences were held at the Seimas 
Palace today. Here is Madona Luckaite reporting on some of them. 
  [Luckaite] Chairman of the Center Union and Seimas member 
Romualdas Ozolas spoke on issues of Lithuanian foreign policy. 
In two weeks time a meeting of the presidents of the Baltic 
states should be held in Palanga during which the question of 
whether it is expedient to appeal to the United Nations 
concerning the recognition of the past occupation of the Baltic 
states. He said that Russia was making all efforts that no 
document would testify to the occupation of the Baltic States. 
Therefore the Lithuanian president should once again speak at 
this meeting for the strengthening of the security of all these 
countries. 
  Speaking about the Lithuanian-Polish treaty, Romualdas 
Ozolas 
said that a treaty where there is no assessment of the 
Zeligowski aggression, at least in a declaration, is not worth 
signing at all. The following version is even better: the treaty 
has been signed, however, the declaration has not. This would be 
a clear assessment of the aggression. The presently existing 
text of the treaty cannot be signed. International documents 
have to be worded clearly and [words indistinct] truth should be 
placed between Lithuania and Poland, Romualdas Ozolas stressed. 
Gediminas Vagnorius, member of the Lithuanian Seimas and 
chairman of the Lithuanian Conservative Party administration 
board, speaking at the press conference held by the Seimas 
opposition, said that 16 months have already passed after the 
Seimas elections; however, the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party 
had not yet started to carry out its duties. It is looking 
backwards and it is firmly aspiring to satisfy personal property 
interests. 
  So far it is impossible to see any signs of stabilization 
because the industrial output has fallen even by 2.5 times since 
the Seimas elections and continues to decline by ten percent 
every month. The real income of the population is maintained by 
using the credits received from abroad, yet in spite of this the 
average wages in the country at the beginning of this year 
reached only 290 litas while in the autumn of 1992 it was more 
than 600 litas. 
  Last year, 10 percent of enterprises were registered 
according to the law on primary privatization as separate 
companies avoiding the privatization departments and thus 
avoiding any payment. 
  Attempts are made to transfer property worth six or seven 
billion litas which is almost the amount of capital which had to 
be transferred to saving and other banks for the compensation of 
peoples lost savings. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Svetlana Sukhova report under the "Situation Regarding </F>
Crimea" rubric: "They Write Down `Crimea' and Bear `Donbass' in 
Mind"] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian parliament decision to deprive Crimea 
of economic and political autonomy (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 25 
and 26 February) has given rise to widespread dissatisfaction 
both in Crimea and in Ukraine itself. Yesterday Crimean 
President Yuriy Meshkov, when asked about the legitimacy of his 
trips to Moscow and the agreements he concluded with the Russian 
authorities, said that he "does not have to report to the 
Ukrainian president." Ukraine's parliamentarians and president 
themselves have long been aware of the unfeasibility of the 24 
February resolution. Currently, however, Kiev fears that not 
only Simferopol, but also eastern Ukrainian regions may demand 
autonomy, which would be much more dangerous. 
  Sergey Kunitsyn, Ukrainian deputy and chairman of the Union 
of Support for the Republic of Crimea, said on the evening of 28 
February that the Crimean Supreme Soviet would not adhere to the 
parliamentary decree on the status of Crimea. In his view, 
"There is no mechanism to enforce the decree" and there are 
virtually no Ukrainian state structures on Crimean territory 
except for the army. The most important thing, Sergey Kunitsyn 
said, is not to give Ukraine a pretext for "rash actions." 
President Leonid Kravchuk, for his part, is trying to frighten 
Simferopol with precisely this turn of events. He expressed his 
confidence that Crimea would not embark on the path of 
confrontation, "otherwise this will cause harm." He recalled 
that Crimea is an integral, albeit autonomous, part of Ukraine, 
hence any actions aimed at noncompliance with this provision 
will be illegal. Kravchuk attempted to sweeten the pill, 
however, as he said that "the regions should have greater 
autonomy, particularly with regard to the economy and culture." 
Leonid Grach, leader of the Crimean Communist Party, which is 
growing stronger by the day, believes that the resolution on 
Crimea expresses "the ambitions of lame-ducks," but the problem 
concerning the parliamentary decision may be resolved by holding 
elections for all branches of power. He expressed his hope that 
Kravchuk will be prudent enough not to enforce the provision on 
appointing a representative of the Ukrainian president in Crimea 
so as not to heighten tensions. 
  In the view of KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts, tensions over 
Ukrainian integrity may heighten not only inside the 
Moscow-Kiev-Simferopol triangle. Even at present the 
centrifugal forces in eastern Ukraine with its predominantly 
Russian-speaking population are giving Kiev a headache. By 
passing strict but effectively unenforceable resolutions on 
Crimea, politicians in Kiev bear Donbass in mind, too. This 
consideration will inevitably prod them to demonstrate toughness 
regarding the "separatists." Harsh statements and resolutions, 
however, tend to wear out with excessive use.

  [Text] Kiev -- A direct phone-in between readers and the 
Yevhen Marchuk, chairman of Ukraine's security service [SBU], 
was held on 1 March in the editorial office of the MOLOD 
UKRAYINY newspaper. Afterward, Marchuk said in particular 
during an interview with journalists that the situation in 
Crimea would have been much more complex if "certain actions" 
had not been taken. "The problem of Crimea and of 
regionalization as a whole is one of those kind of threats which 
is of prime importance to Ukraine, owing to economic, 
historical, and other reasons," Yevhen Marchuk said. 
  He is also convinced that there are no grounds for 
dramatizing the situation, since Ukraine has the force to 
prevent the development of events similar to those in 
Yugoslavia. The head of the SBU is convinced that only the 
strategic internal policy of the Ukrainian leadership in its 
attitude not only toward Crimea but also toward other regions, 
in particular the Donbass, Transcarpathia, and Bukovina, could 
speedily neutralize a threat to the decentraliztion of the 
state. 
  In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent, Yevhen Marchuk 
confirmed that he had a meeting last week with people from 
Yevhen Saburov's entourage, who had been invited by Yuriy 
Meshkov to take up the post of vice premier of Crimea. The SBU 
head declined to comment on the subject discussed. 
  Yevhen Marchuk also said that the security service has 
information ("details, personalities, names and numbers") about 
the fact that foreign structures are attempting to interfere in 
Ukraine's election campaign, "beside our own native criminal 
capital." In his words, the security service will make use of 
its entire mechanism to uncover such facts. 
  In reply to a question from a UNIAN correspondent about how 
the SBU intends to counteract such manifestations, Yevhen 
Marchuk said: "This will be done with specific state of the art 
methods until evidence is gathered. Only then will we publicly 
reveal such facts." Yevhen Marchuk gave assurances that "the 
SBU would pass some information on certain parliamentary 
candidates to the Central Electoral Commission and leaders of 
political parties on whose behalf these candidates are running." 
He stressed that they "are talking about specific facts and 
cases rather than interference by the security services in the 
election campaign."

  [Text] Defense Minister General Vitaliy Radetskyy has 
issued an open letter appeal to the personnel of the Armed 
Forces, families of servicemen, and the Ukrainian people. The 
defense minister has been forced to do this by the moral and 
psychological situation in and around our Armed Forces. 
  Time has not yet managed to cure our units and subunits of 
the old defects of the Soviet Army, reads the appeal. Today, we 
can observe how new viruses are creeping through barrack windows 
and checkpoints in military towns to deprave the military 
organism. In the opinion of the defense minister, there is 
only one way to cure this disease: We will overcome this 
disease only if order is restored and the Army is cemented by 
strict military discipline. 
  Appealing to parents whose sons are already serving in the 
Army or still studying in school, to soldiers and their 
commanders, to pedagogues, to wives of commanders and chiefs, 
and to famous patriots and honorable citizens of our country, 
Vitaliy Radetskyy says: Only together, as were our forefathers, 
can we achieve the desired goal. The time has come to turn our 
faces toward the barracks and the Army, reads the appeal issued 
by the defense minister, because it is no longer imperial, but 
our own Army with the Lvov dignity, Poltava diligence, Odessa 
humor, and Chernihiv joyfulness. 
  Ukrainian Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy believes and 
expects 
that the appeal will be understood by every conscious Ukrainian 
citizen, and that an agreement on looking for common ways of 
overcoming the complex situation in the Army will be found.

  [Editorial Report] Kiev Ukrayinske Radio First Program 
Network in Ukrainian at 1305 GMT on 1 March broadcasts the 
"Independence" program featuring a recorded interview with 
Yevhen Marchuk, chief of the Ukrainian Security Service, by an 
unidentified correspondent. 
  The correspondent begins by asking Marchuk what measures are 
undertaken by the state to ensure the reliable and efficient 
operation of the Ukrainian Security Service, SBU. Yevhen 
Marchuk responds by acknowledging the difficult financial 
situation of all organizations financed by the state budget. 
This is evidenced by the SBU's budget for this year which will 
"be enough to keep our agency going only for seven months, and 
only to meet our very basic needs, such as payments for 
electricity, running water, heating and salaries for the 
employees." Marchuk explains that in a bid to improve its 
financial standing, the SBU sent letters to the Ukrainian 
Cabinet of Ministers, Supreme Council, and the president 
requesting financial help and emphasizing its role in providing 
money for the state budget. For example, last year, the agency 
confiscated 211 billion karbovanets, 156,000 Deutschemarks, and 
$388 million during the investigation of criminal cases alone. 
Some $560 million were saved for the state budget as a result 
of the agency's efforts to prevent the conclusion of contracts 
that would be unprofitable for Ukraine. The SBU chief stresses 
that "this is a lot more than the organization's budget for the 
last year." 
  Marchenko goes on to specify how much money was recovered by 
specific SBU oblast bureaus for the state budget. According to 
him, some of the best working bureaus are in Lvov, Donetsk, 
Kiev, Khmelnytsky, and Lutsk, all of which could earn money for 
themselves. Considering this substantial contribution to the 
state reserve, Marchuk says that his agency has asked the state 
for permission to receive 30 percent of the money confiscated as 
a result of investigations of criminal cases. This issue is 
currently being considered by the financial minister and acting 
prime minister. 
  The SBU chief emphasizes that this is a temporary measure, 
intended to tide the agency over during the current crisis 
period. To corroborate this move, he recalls the recent 
abduction by a terrorist in Lugansk Oblast of a bus with 
children. The SBU agents had to collect all of the available 
gasoline reserves to capture the criminal. In addition, because 
of low salaries of SBU employees, Marchuk complains, "none of 
the Kiev university judiciary department graduates agreed to 
work with our organization." According to Marchuk, this example 
proves that the financing of special services, whose output can 
not always be expressed in money, should be executed on a 
different basis from that applied to all other institutions and 
enterprises. 
  The correspondent then says that many people wonder whether 
the SBU needs to be financed so heftily at a time when Ukraine, 
and the SBU itself, no longer has enemies. Marchuk answers: "I 
heard about this opinion and can understand it. Outsiders 
simply are not aware of the magnitude and scope of the problems 
that the Ukrainian security service has to grapple with. There 
are no enemies in terms of the standoff of two hostile camps. 
However, at present, we see as many threats -- and not enemies 
or adversaries -- to Ukraine as when Ukraine was part of the 
Soviet Union. Socioeconomic threats are even more dangerous 
today. They threaten the civilian peace and stability of the 
state, although I hope we will not come to this. In addition, 
there are many issues that are not publicly discussed, such as 
activities of intelligence and counterintelligence. 
  He continues: In economic terms, the world is a place for 
competition with its tough rules. The emergence of a new 
partner in a place where everything is carved up would never be 
welcomed. Ukraine is a serious partner, even though some may 
think that no one over there fears us. Nothing of the kind. I 
mean, in economic, not in military terms. No one is waiting to 
embrace Ukraine with its agricultural potential. Because it is 
clear that if we put our agriculture in order, we could flood 
Russia and all of Europe with our produce. But there, 
everything is settled and agreed upon. Strange as it may sound, 
this is just how it is. We have an immense industrial 
potential. Obsolete and run-down, it can be supported by our 
intellectual resources. We have highly skilled professionals. 
  He goes on to say: But everything is divided in Europe in 
this field. So, from the professional point of view, 
intelligence is a normal thing in this situation. I mean, 
intelligence operations conducted by those countries -- and our 
country, too -- in order to know... What is intelligence? This 
is a state institution executing political or scientific tasks, 
only by special methods. Although we may not have the kind of 
enemies we used to have in the past, we have instead very 
serious competitors that can influence the shape of Ukraine. 
This applies not only to the policies of our state, but also to 
specific companies, concerns, and economic powerhouses. Those 
enterprises are closely watched so that Ukraine does not inflict 
any damage on them. And all of this involves intelligence, 
which calls for strong counterintelligence. 
  Marchuk says: "The present situation in Ukraine facilitated 
the presence of other intelligence services here. We are 
gradually moving now to improve our work here. For example, you 
know that the legislature has recently adopted the law on state 
secrets, and the structure of our counterintelligence has been 
adapted to modern developments. So, we do not say that we have 
military enemies, but Ukraine will have economic and political 
competitors -- enough for our generation and some generations to 
come. This is the real world. It is highly competitive both 
economically and politically." 
  Concluding the interview, the correspondent asks Yevhen 
Marchuk what topics will be discussed during following 
interviews with him -- soon to be featured on the "Independence" 
program. According to Marchuk, those topics include combating 
organized crime, especially in banking, protection of the 
national economy, protection of national statehood and 
integrity, military counterintelligence, and others.

<F P=106> [Article by I. Nedyukha, candidate of technological </F>
sciences: "Ukraine's Nuclear `Cheapness'"] 
  [Text] Here is information that was broadcast on 16 
January on the "Ostankino" TV channel: "Ukraine will not 
receive any other compensations except for reciprocal fuel 
elements for atomic electric power plants." Proceeding from 
this concise thesis, what advantages for Ukraine can one speak 
about in general? 
  First, Ukraine will only receive $300 million out of the 
$800 
million allocated by the United States for the nuclear 
disarmament of the CIS countries. This sum [$300 million] is 
allocated for dismantling the world's third most powerful 
nuclear arsenal that is much larger than those of, for example, 
Belarus and Kazakhstan taken together. 
  Second, Ukraine will have to allocate several times that sum 
from its own resources for the destruction of the missiles 
themselves, their fuel filling, and especially launch silos. In 
accordance with previous estimates, this will amount to at least 
$3.2 billion. However, who will cover the resulting deficit of 
about $3 billion for the service being rendered by Ukraine in 
order to reinforce the national security of the United States 
and Russia, something, which the leaders of those countries do 
not deny. What about the advertised free market principles, 
based upon a balance of demand and supply? 
  Third, if something really needs to be compensated for in 
full, it is Ukraine's growing strategic vulnerability. In 
accordance with the information issued by high-ranking 
representatives of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense that was 
broadcast on Ukrainian TV Channel One on 17 January, it may be 
necessary to proceed to modern types of nonnuclear weapons, 
something about which the Ukrainian president cautioned earlier. 
This means that it will be necessary to take additional 
enormous sums from the budget. However, due to the absence of 
any prospects of resolving this problem without assistance from 
the Russian military industrial complex, more specifically, by 
crediting its functioning, this may only be done by lowering the 
standard of living of the Ukrainian population. 
  Fourth, such crediting will, in fact, be done for Russia's 
atomic industry. Russia has the possibility of selling the 
Ukrainian part of uranium for hard currency and at world prices 
and, at the same time, setting exclusive prices for those fuel 
elements that will be supplied to Ukraine. Belarus has already 
expressed its disagreement with Russia's thesis that the "lion's 
share" of profits from the sales of uranium will go toward 
covering the expenditure for destroying the missiles (IZVESTIYA, 
19 January 1994.) 
  Moreover, at the news conference held by Colonel General Ye. 
Maslin, main expert of Russia's Ministry of Defense, that was 
broadcast by "Ostankino" on 18 January, a categorical demand was 
made that all nuclear missile warheads be immediately 
transferred to Russia as only then would reciprocal supplies of 
fuel elements be made. As they say, the more you have, the more 
you want. 
  On the whole, even from the point of view of the degree of 
reliability of the highly advertised economic advantages that 
Ukraine may get, all of this does not look as radiant and nice 
as the numerous "advertisers" are trying to prove. At the same 
time, the "Ostankino" TV channel asserts with confidence and 
optimism that here, too, "Russia will in no way sacrifice its 
own national interests." He asks: Can anyone say the same 
thing about Ukraine? 
  This particularly applies to the problem of guaranteeing 
Ukraine's national security, especially against the background 
of the recent "optimistically probabilistic" statement by the 
U.S. President who said there were "very good chances that 
Russia will not become an expansionist state again and will not 
threaten its neighbors." In simpler terms, this statement means 
that the United States will certainly never get involved in 
warfare with nuclear Russia, even if the latter does resume its 
"old" practices. 
  What real guarantees for Ukraine can one talk about in 
general, if the two formal presidential guarantees in respect of 
the 14 January 1994 agreement will expire in three years time? 
  Regarding declarations about the beginning of a new 
nonnuclear era, India has already dropped its "nuclear fly" into 
the nonnuclear "ointment" of the American and Russian promises, 
having declared that it was not going to proceed in the 
"Ukrainian direction," also in view of all its accompanying 
motivations. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that Ukraine 
will remain the only standard-bearer of the movement toward a 
radiant "nonnuclear" future. It is true, however, that we are 
used to moving in "radiant" directions. In recent decades, we 
have done nothing but that.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mykola Okhmakevych, president of the </F>
Ukrainian Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, by UNIAN 
correspondent Inha Balytska; place and date not given: "The 
Itinerary of Ukraine's International Broadcasting Passes Through 
Jerusalem"] 
  [Text] The first Ukrainian program was beamed to all 
continents on 18 February. The only places where it will not be 
seen are some regions in the Pacific and western parts of the 
United States and Canada. From now on, every Friday, there will 
be 50 minutes of Ukrainian Television on the international air. 
This is the result of an agreement concluded between the 
Ukrainian Television and Radio Broadcasting Company and Israeli 
television structures. This event is commented upon by 
president of the Ukrainian Television and Radio Broadcasting 
Company Mykola Okhmakevych. 
  [Okhmakevych] During the times of the USSR, we did not give 
much thought to using space for applied purposes. In those 
times, Ukraine did not use artificial satellites for 
broadcasting our programs to other countries, and there are 
practically no other ways. As a result, the only television 
program that has a satellite channel is "Ostankino." 
  When I was invited to negotiate with Israel's Television 
(credit must be given to Ukraine's Embassy in Israel for the 
preliminary work it did), I did not expect that in the very near 
future, we would have regular satellite television broadcasting 
to all continents. We are working with the organization 
"Intergama." "Intergama" leases quite powerful satellites. It 
turned out later that "Intergama" does not have enough programs 
to work with. That is why an idea emerged: "Why not beam 
Ukrainian Television programs on the international air?" 
  [Balytska] Who will prepare the international program and 
what it will look like? 
  [Okhmakevych] For this, we are creating a special editorial 
board (for the time being, about 10 persons). The first two 
programs were made as a digest: information block, which may 
present interest, and a number of interviews, which will 
elucidate Ukraine's policy as we see it and not as the foreign 
press comments upon it. 
  Speeches by the state's leading persons are planned. Various 
information materials will be presented, including some concert 
features. At first glance, everything looks somewhat eclectic, 
but when we proceed to new proportions (I am sure that we will 
expand them), we will build our program differently. 
  [Balytska] Consequently, the programs will be exclusively in 
Ukrainian? 
  [Okhmakevych] Yes, they are meant for those who want to 
watch Ukrainian-language programs. 
  [Balytska] Perhaps, it might be worthwhile to provide 
translation so that those who have no command of the Ukrainian 
language would also be able to obtain information on Ukraine? 
  [Okhakevych] I think that this might be possible at a new 
stage, but not now. Approximately 20 million Ukrainians live 
abroad, including nearby foreign countries. This program is 
mainly for them. 
  [Balytska] "Non-foreign" Ukrainians will never see it? 
  [Okhmakevych] I think that, in the course of time, it will 
also be possible to see it here -- we already have the 
enterprise "Saturn" with corresponding technological means. 
  [Balytska] Tell me, please, where are you getting the money 
for all of this? 
  [Okhmakevych] A joint Ukrainian-Israeli venture was created. 
It must ensure the payment and even a possibility of getting 
some profit (mainly through carrying advertisements). Besides, 
"Intergama" works on connecting this channel to the cable 
television of all consumer countries (there already exist such 
agreements), and if there is stable reception, there may be 
profits. 
  I hope that in the future, our program for abroad will be 
available on a daily basis -- three or four hours a day and not 
just once a week. The main thing is to just begin, and we have 
done this.

  [Text] A senior official in the Russian defense industry 
who spied for Britain and was detained by the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, was an agent of the caliber of 
Penkovskiy or Tolkachev, who had spied for the West in 1960s. 
An informed source in the Service told Interfax Wednesday that 
the damage done by that agent could hardly be calculated. 
  According to the FCIS, the spy kept the British services 
informed on the latest Russian weapons, financing of defense 
research and development and Russia's defense technology 
cooperation with other countries. 
  The source said that the report, made public on March 1, 
about the arrest of a Russian citizen who spied for Britain had 
nothing to do with the Ames case in the U.S. he added that 
unlike the Ameses whose cooperation with Russian special 
services had yet to be proven, the Russian citizen had been 
caught in the act (he carried spying equipment and manuals on 
using caches -- IF) and admitted his guilt. 
  The source said that the Western spying services had stepped 
up their activities in Russia. In 1993 alone 20 people were 
convicted for spying. Colonel Baranov of the Intelligence Main 
Office of the General Staff was convicted on February 19. 
  The FCIS official said that the West was trying to pressure 
certain political figures in Russia to impose another 
reshuffling of the Russian intelligence and counterintelligence 
services, thus attempting to paralyze them.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Sedykh report under the "Scandal" rubric: "Spies </F>
Without Number"] 
  [Text] The discovery and arrest of a high-ranking employee 
of one of the Moscow agencies of the Russian defense complex 
recruited last year by the British intelligence service once 
more confirms that active work by Western special services 
against Russia is being done. 
  Commenting on this case, Aleksandr Mikhaylov, head of the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] public relations 
center, has stated in a KURANTY interview that when foreign 
special services are acting in Russia in an extremely brazen and 
pushy manner, it is very important for our law and order organs 
not to relax, and put the adversary in his place. He underlined 
that the FCS would resolutely cut short such anti-Russia 
activity. "When we are given the possibility to do our 
professional business, concrete results have appeared." In 
1993, 20 citizens of Russia were indicted for high treason in 
the form of spying, including Baranov, a Main Intelligence 
Directorate officer, who was sentenced to six years imprisonment. 
  Asked if he could give the agent's name, Mikhaylov said it 
was not known to him; however, he revealed the nature of his 
work. The English agent was in particular in charge of 
financing the Russian "defense industry" [oboronka] and his 
organization's export activities, and the military-industrial 
complex's high-tech programs. According to the FCS spokesman, 
this disclosure is in no way connected with the Ames case. 
  [Sedykh] Would this be further followed up by an expulsion 
from the country of an English spy? 
  [Mikhaylov] This decision will be made by the top political 
leadership. Quite possibly, a rather high-ranking member of 
Great Britain's embassy in Moscow will have to leave Russia.

<F P=106> [Ravil Mustafin commentary: "Spy Passions. Ameses' Guilt </F>
Still Has To Be Proved in Court, While British Spy in Moscow Has 
Already Confessed Everything"] 
  [Excerpts] On Tuesday [1 March] hearings took place 
concerning the case of the Ames couple, who are accused of 
spying for Moscow. An ITAR-TASS correspondent reports that only 
a small group of journalists was admitted to the hearings on the 
pretext that there were "not enough seats." It can thus be said 
that the judicial part of the "biggest spy scandal," as the 
sensation-seeking U.S. press has dubbed this case, is 
essentially taking place behind closed doors. [passage omitted] 
  That is how events are developing in Washington. But what is 
happening in Moscow? 
  In Moscow the Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS) has 
reported that the espionage activity of a leading official in a 
military-industrial complex organization has been terminated. 
Criminal proceedings have already been instituted in this case. 
The spy was arrested 15 January and on 25 January he was charged 
with treason against the motherland in the form of espionage. 
  During the preliminary investigation our counterintelligence 
officers obtained evidence showing that the defendant was at 
some time recruited by the British intelligence services and 
that he received from them special espionage equipment, secret 
writing materials, and instructions about methods of secretly 
communicating in Moscow with the British Embassy station. The 
spy worked exclusively for money, gathering and passing on 
information of a secret military and economic nature. We were 
informed by the FCS that the information handed over contained 
data on the latest Russian efforts in the sphere of developing 
various weapons systems and their specifications and performance 
characteristics, on the financing of defense research and 
development work, and on the state, prospects, and organization 
of military-technical cooperation between Russia and foreign 
countries. 
  But while in Washington the Ameses' guilt still has to be 
proved, in Moscow the British spy has already admitted his 
guilt. Moreover, Russian counterintelligence officers 
neutralized this agent without kicking up a big fuss in front of 
the whole world. Especially as nobody in Moscow intends to 
transfer this event, which is routine for the special services, 
to the dimension of Russian-British relations and base a 
particular policy on it. 
  Simple chronology shows that the British spy's arrest in 
Moscow can in no way be regarded as revenge for the Ameses' 
detention. Therefore the statement by British Labor Party 
Spokesman Allan Rogers that actions based on the "eye for an 
eye, a tooth for a tooth" principle can be discerned in all 
these cases looks plain silly.

"`The Ames Affair' Expands in Russia"] 
  [Text] The spy family affair in the United States is being 
continued with the arrests of foreign special services agents in 
Russia. While it is unknown what circle of persons is involved 
in this process, it may prove rather wide. 
  Your SEGODNYA correspondent has been told by Aleksandr 
Mikhaylov, chief of the Federal Counterintelligence Service 
[FCS] public relations center, that a high-ranking foreign 
intelligence agent was detained on 15 January. According to Mr. 
Mikhaylov, the detainee had been recruited by representatives of 
the English special service. Searches have turned up in his 
possession devices for cryptography and photographing of 
documents, instructions for dead drops in Moscow, and other 
things used by spies. The newspaper's office has managed to 
find out that the person involved is a senior official of the 
SMM (Spetsialnoye Mashinostroyeniye i Metallurgiya) [Special 
Machine-Building and Metallurgy] joint-stock company created on 
the basis of enterprises of the former USSR Oboronprom [defense 
industry] in charge of the completion of state programs in the 
area of armored equipment and artillery systems. The level of 
this position can be illustrated by the fact that he had the 
possibility of direct access to representatives of legal 
operatives of the English intelligence service under embassy 
"cover." The detained man is charged with passing to a foreign 
special service the most classified information on the newest 
systems of armaments and Russia's general defense potential. On 
25 February, he was officially charged under Article 64, item 
"a" (high treason in the form of spying), and he fully admitted 
his guilt. 
  The information the newspaper's office received about 
arrests 
in the FCS itself and the Federal Agency for Government 
Communications and Information (FAGCI) have still not been 
officially confirmed. Mr. Mikhaylov, too, "does not confirm" 
(neither does he deny) the fact of a FCS officer's having been 
arrested. FAGCI spokesman Vyacheslav Tupitsyn told your 
SEGODNYA correspondent that there had been no arrests in his 
agency of officers suspected of the commission of crimes 
stipulated by articles of the "special section" of Russia's 
Criminal Code.

<F P=106> [Pavel Shinkarenko article under "Day's Event" rubric: "Spy </F>
Passions Have Begun in Washington But Are Subsiding in Moscow"] 
  [Text] We thought that the era of partnership that 
recently became established between the Kremlin and the White 
House could not revive the spy mania that had characterized the 
"Cold War" times. But no. Passions not inferior to the most 
somber "witch hunt" models have flared up in Washington -- from 
the White House and the Department of State to the CIA 
headquarters. What has been the cause of such hysteria? 
  On 22 February Vladimir Chkhikvishvili, Russian charge 
d'affaires ad interim in the United States, was invited to the 
State Department, where he was told of the arrest of Aldrich 
Hazen Ames, a high-ranking CIA staffer, and his wife Maria Ames 
on a charge of working for Soviet and then also Russian 
intelligence. In this connection a protest was made to the 
diplomat. The next day Thomas Pickering, the U.S. ambassador in 
Moscow, made a similar demarche when he met with Sergey Lavrov, 
Russian Federation deputy minister of foreign affairs. 
  Not that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was inclined to 
dramatize the situation. In particular, Grigoriy Karasin, 
director of the Information and Press Department, believes that, 
according to the information on the "Ames case" provided by the 
State Department, Moscow has questions which it would be most 
convenient to clear up by means of direct contacts between the 
special services. But Washington's reasoning was different: 
The next day Aleksandr Lysenko, the official representative of 
the Russian Federation Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] at the 
Russian Embassy in the United States, was declared persona non 
grata and ordered to leave U.S. territory within a week. 
According to the information received at the Foreign Ministry, 
Aleksandr Lysenko could not have had contacts with the Ames: He 
arrived in the United States only last summer, and the 
investigation into their case has already been going on for more 
than 10 months. Lysenko has been named merely because some time 
ago the Russian and U.S. special services each agreed to 
disclose one of their own representatives working under cover of 
a diplomatic passport. This was done to coordinate actions in 
the struggle against international terrorism and the drug 
business. 
  On talking recently with Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the 
Duma 
International Affairs Committee and in the recent past the 
Russian Federation's ambassador to the United States, I asked a 
question also about the prospects of the "Ames case." "Foreign 
intelligence is commonplace in international practice," Vladimir 
Petrovich explained. "Today they have disclosed a spy in the 
United States, tomorrow they will find one in Russia, but I 
believe that our president will not make a tragedy out of this. 
Moreover, the guilt of the Ames has not yet been proved, and 
for this there must be a trial." 
  The prognosis was confirmed. A week after the State 
Department's protest Russia made a counterstrike, so to speak, 
"on a mutual basis." On Monday the Russian Federation Foreign 
Ministry made a representation to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in 
connection with the expulsion of the FIS official representative 
from Washington. "In this situation," the Foreign Ministry note 
states, "we are forced on the basis of reciprocity to declare 
the CIA's representative in Moscow persona non grata and to 
demand his departure from the Russian Federation." According to 
information received from the Foreign Ministry, Embassy 
Counsellor James L. Morris must leave within seven days. 
  Our attempt to secure a comment from the Lubyanka was not 
successful. FIS Director Yevgeniy Primakov gave a brief reply 
to an analogous request from an ITAR-TASS correspondent: "No 
comment." To all appearances, CIA Director Woolsey is also 
behaving with delicacy -- which obviously attests to a 
reluctance to fuel passions. Particularly as last year, so 
Germany's DIE WELT reported recently, 20 people were arrested in 
Russia for spying for Western countries. Unlike the United 
States, however, Moscow did not try to blow up any scandal, the 
newspaper emphasizes. 
  What is more, recent data published by FIS experts indicate 
that the claims by Neil Gerardo, president of the U.S. Gerardo 
International Corporation, that Aldrich Ames could have passed 
to Moscow production secrets of the company's new invention -- 
the so-called MRX defense technology -- were an overt 
fabrication. Information about Ames' involvement in the drugs 
trade is also no more than disinformation. 
  Against the background of these facts there can be just one 
conclusion: There are influential forces in the United States 
which would like, if not to return Russian-U.S. relations to the 
"Cold War" epoch, then at least to cast a shadow of mutual 
mistrust over our leaders and to halt the movement which has 
begun toward a Russian-U.S. partnership.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS analyst Andrey Palaria] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 2 TASS -- The recent arrest of a 
British secret agent, who held a high-ranking position in 
Russia's military industrial complex, clearly indicated that 
Western special services did not intend to scale down their 
intelligence activities in Russia. 
  Not many details are available so far for obvious reasons. 
Thus, the name of the exposed spy is not given, the same as the 
duration of his work for MI-6. But even the smallest pieces of 
information available show that a serious damage could be caused 
to Russia, because the data conveyed by the SIS agent concerned 
the latest developments in building various arms systems, their 
tactical technical parameters, funding of defence-related 
activities, the present condition and prospects for military 
technical cooperation between Russia and foreign countries. 
  Last year, 20 foreign special agents were brought to trial 
in 
Russia. The arrest of another spy spotlit an extremely thorny 
problem, that of reliable protection of our secrets. This 
problem is not new, but it calls for serious consideration and 
solution, taking into account the increasing shift towards 
industrial espionage in activities of special services, 
according to Russia's Federal Counterintelligence Service. This 
holds true not only about the U.S., British and German secret 
services, but also to major Western corporations seeking to 
obtain, by any possible means, information about plans of their 
rivals, of which Russia [is] a key one. For this reason, 
experts note, our country needs a mechanism for reliable 
protection of its priorities in the fields of science, 
technology and know-how, let alone other specific activities. 
Otherwise, it would be more profitable for Russian specialists 
to sell their developments to the West, and shortly afterwards 
the state would have to use them on a license basis. 
  The arrest of a British secret agent, who was caught 
red-handed on January 15, is not the only case in a series of 
spy exposures in russia. Many of them were much spoken about, 
the others did not receive such a wide public response. All 
this testifies to a continuous confrontation between the Soviet 
and the Russian special services and foreign ones, which has 
quite a long history. Some events in this history are as 
follows. 
  In the United States: 1978 -- three diplomats were expelled 
from the country, 1986 -- the number of expulsions made up 80 
diplomats. 1987 -- Marine Sergeant Clayton Lonetree was 
sentenced to 30 years in prison for espionage for the soviet 
intelligence service. 1989 -- Soviet military diplomat Yuriy 
Pakhtusov was declared persona non grata. Last February 1994 -- 
Russian Embassy counsellor Aleksandr Lysenko was expelled from 
the United States. 
  As for the Soviet Union and Russia, the facts are as 
follows: 
March 7, 1983 -- U.S. Embassy First Secretary Richard Osborne 
was expelled from the country. September 11, 1983 -- U.S. 
Consul in Leningrad London Davin Augustenborg were declared 
personas non grata. [as received] June 2, 1983 -- U.S. Embassy 
attache Lewis Thomas was caught red-handed in Moscow. June 13, 
1985 -- U.S. Embassy Second Secretary Paul Stonebough was 
declared persona non grata. 1986 -- Over 10 U.S. diplomats were 
declared personas non grata. September 7, 1986 -- Charges were 
brought against U.S. Citizen Nicholas Daniloff who was detained 
on August 30, 1986, during a secret spy action. He was expelled 
from the country on September 29. March 1989 -- Aide to the 
military attache Daniel F. van Ghandi was declared persona non 
grata. February 1994 -- U.S. Embassy counsellor James Morris 
was declared persona non grata. 
  In Great Britain: 1972-1984 -- nine Soviet diplomats were 
expelled from the country. 1985 -- former KGB secret police 
officer Oleg Gordiyevsky, who was recruited by britain's MI-6 in 
1974, was illegally taken from the Soviet Union. September 1985 
-- 25 Soviet representatives were expelled from Great Britain. 
The Soviet side retaliated by expelling six British 
representatives from the country on September 18, 1985. 1989 -- 
the British Government expelled from the country 11 Soviet 
officials and declared another three Soviet officials, who left 
the country earlier, personas non grata. 
  May 1989 -- the Soviet Government expelled 11 British 
officials from the country. Three British citizens, who earlier 
worked in Moscow, were declared personas non grata. 
  In France: 1977 -- a Soviet official at UNESCO was expelled. 
1980 -- the Soviet consul in Marseilles was expelled. Late 
March 1983 -- French authorities expelled from the country, 
without any grounds, 47 staffers of the Soviet embassy and other 
offices. March 16, 1987 -- seven men were arrested in Rouen on 
charges of industrial espionage for the Soviet Union. Failing 
to prove their guilt, court had to release the suspects. 
  This is how the special services of Russia, the United 
States, Great Britain and France had been working for the past 
several years. And this work is most likely to be continued in 
future.

  [Text] Russia will not recognize the creation of an 
independent state of Bosnian Serbs. This was stated by Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev in an interview to RIA. At the same 
time he underlined that Russia recognizes the Bosnian Serbs as 
one of the conflicting sides. 
  The head of the Foreign Ministry paid special attention to 
the conclusion of an agreement on the airport in Tuzla. Kozyrev 
believes that this agreement could be assessed as the second 
breakthrough in the settlement of the Bosnian crisis, after 
Sarajevo. The Russian minister also added that Moscow does not 
insist on the sending of a U.S. peacemaking contingent to 
Bosnia.

  [Text] Moscow, 2 Mar -- "Today Russia is on the side of the 
Bosnian Serbs," Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Federation 
Council, declared at the end of the talks with Radovan Karadzic, 
leader of the Bosnian Serbs. He went on to specify that it was 
a question of peacekeeping efforts within the framework of the 
international process of a Bosnian settlement. "Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin took the initiative, and Radovan 
Karadzic accepted the initiative and met it half way. The peace 
process is continuing despite everything." This is not only a 
great achievement by Russian diplomacy, but a demonstration to 
the whole world of Russia's independent policy, Vladimir 
Shumeyko emphasized. 
  It is now hard to separate military events from political 
ones, he continued. The decision we made yesterday -- we 
prepared Tuzla Airport for plane landings and humanitarian 
deliveries -- knocks the ground from under the feet of those 
forces that would like the confrontation to continue. 
  Vladimir Shumeyko also stated that he "had a very high 
regard 
for the meeting and the current visit by Karadzic and his 
colleagues," which, according to him, "is of tremendous 
importance to the destiny of peoples." 
  Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, on his part, 
said: "Today we spoke about peace and about the possibility of 
establishing peace and Russian soldiers are a hope for us." He 
noted that U.S. interference in the Bosnian crisis was justified 
only if the Americans did not side with anyone in the conflict. 
No single country "can take the place of the United Nations," 
he noted. In order to achieve a settlement of the problem it is 
important that all of those who participate in this settlement 
should display an unbiased towards the various sides. We expect 
Russia to be on our side, Karadzic stressed, only on the 
question of achieving peace". We do not expect Russia to defend 
exclusively our interests." 
  Radovan Karadzic also said that he does not differentiate 
between the peacekeeping forces on grounds of their nationality. 
Up to now, the Serbs have had "warm feelings" for all 
representatives of the peacekeeping forces regardless of their 
nationality. However, the Russian contingent enjoys the 
"special trust" of the Serbian population.

  [Text] Moscow, 2 Mar (TANJUG) -- "Russia is on the side of 
those Serbs in Bosnia who are working for peace," Vladimir 
Shumeyko, chairman of the Federation Council, said today 
following his talks with Radovan Karadzic, president of the Serb 
Republic. 
  The chairman of the upper chamber of the Russian parliament 
did not specify what he meant by this. He went on to say that 
"some forces in the world today want the confrontation in former 
Yugoslavia to continue." The Bosnian Serbs' decision to allow 
Tuzla airport to be opened for humanitarian aid deliveries 
"knocks the ground from under the feet of those forces." 
  During his meeting with journalists, Karadzic said that 
Bosnian Serbs are ready to work for a peaceful solution to the 
Bosnian crisis and that mechanisms for achieving this goal are 
being discussed in the talks in Moscow. 
  In reply to a question, the president of the Serb Republic 
said that the Serb side is ready to join the agreement on a 
federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina signed in Washington by the 
Croats and Muslims, "if it is in our interest." 
  Karadzic supported an initiative by Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin for a summit meeting of Russia, the United States, Great 
Britain, France, and Germany. 
  This afternoon Radovan Karadzic had talks in the Russian 
Ministry of Defense with Chief of General Staff Mikhail 
Kolesnikov.

  [Text] Moscow, 2 Mar -- Vitaliy Churkin, the special 
representative of the Russian president and deputy Russian 
foreign minister today met Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the 
Bosnian Serbs, who arrived in Moscow on Monday [28 February] at 
the Russian side's initiative. 
  During the course of talks on problems of a Bosnian 
settlement at the Russian Foreign Ministry, Karadzic spoke about 
the Bosnian Serbs' consent to the opening in the near future of 
the airport at Tuzla under the control of and with the 
participation of international observers in order to supply 
humanitarian cargoes to the town. At the same time, Karadzic 
noted, the Bosnian Serbs proceed from the fact that Russian 
observers will be taking part in controlling the non-military 
use of the airport. 
  Also examined in Moscow were questions of the implementation 
of the Russian president's initiative on holding a summit 
meeting in the Russian capital with the purpose of arriving as 
quickly as possible at an agreement on peace, an all-embracing 
settlement to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the lifting 
of sanctions against the FRY. 
  At a regular working meeting between the Russian president's 
special representative and Karadzic, specific measures for 
implementing the accords and proposals of other countries for 
discussion at a session of the UN Security Council were examined.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Georgiy Shmelev and </F>
Denis Perkin] 
  [Text] Moscow, 2 Mar -- The statement by Andrey Kozyrev, 
Russia's foreign minister, and the leader of Bosnian Serbs 
Radovan Karadzic after the talks on Tuesday [1 March] with 
regard to the unblocking of the airport in Tuzla "is a very 
important political step, apart from the fact that this is an 
extremely significant contribution to improving the humanitarian 
situation in Bosnia- Herzegovina." This was stated at a 
briefing for Russian journalists held at the Russian Federation 
Foreign Ministry by Vitaliy Churkin, a Russian deputy foreign 
minister. According to the high-ranking Russian diplomat, this 
political step is important because in the course of political 
developments Tuzla has lately turned into a second symbol of 
unresolved problems in Bosnia-Herzegovina, next to Sarajevo. As 
long ago as several months or possibly even a year, the opening 
of the airport in Tuzla was declared to be one of the principal 
goals of the European Union; the issue was also mentioned in 
NATO resolutions several times. We have been feeling a certain 
aggravation of the situation around the Tuzla airport recently, 
V. Churkin said. 
  We have, he said, been engaged on this issue for a long time 
and had discussed the subject with the Serbs. At the time they 
had said to us that they were greatly concerned over the fact 
that Tuzla airport would be used by the Muslim side for military 
deliveries. They said that appropriate monitoring of the 
procedure was essential. Some time ago Russia put forward the 
idea that the presence there of Russian observers, along with 
other observers, was needed to remove this concern. For a long 
time we told all those interested in this matter about this 
readiness on our part, the Russian deputy foreign minister 
noted, and it should be said that this readiness on Russia's 
part was immediately welcomed. "I am speaking especially of 
this," V. Churkin emphasized, "because somehow it emerges that 
after yesterday's statement some people have suddenly been 
attempting to present matters as though the Russians had almost 
deceived someone when they issued this statement and suddenly 
prepared this decision." In actual fact there was a 
multilateral UN meeting on 25 February at which this issue was 
also discussed in quite some detail and at which it was stated 
that the opening of Tuzla airport might be pushed through as 
early as 7 March. That is why, the high-ranking Russian 
diplomat considers, noone should be surprised in the slightest 
that such an agreement was finally reached precisely during the 
high-level meeting in Moscow between the Russian foreign 
minister and the leader of the Bosnian Serbs. 
  Vitaliy Churkin continued that now it is up to the Muslim 
side. The discussion of the problem with the Bosnian Serbs was 
held on the basis of a document that was offered to Serbs and 
Muslims by Yasushi Akashi, the representative of the UN 
secretary- general for the former Yugoslavia. It provides for 
the international monitoring and the presence of Muslim and 
Serbian contact groups on the territory of the airport in Tuzla 
to have a truly clear picture that this airport is used for 
humanitarian and not for some other purpose. Vitaliy Churkin 
noted that in this connection "I am at the moment, frankly 
speaking, a little bit surprised that the Muslim leadership is 
speaking out against it. The Muslim leadership is also speaking 
out against the presence of Russian observers and against the 
presence of a contact Serbian group in this airport. It is 
difficult for me to understand why all that is happening." The 
deputy foreign minister of the Russian Federation said that "we 
do not need this; we are going to feed, help, and ensure the 
humanitarian aid not for the Russian population. In the first 
instance this will be the Muslim population, and I repeat, Serbs 
and Croats, as well, if they live in this area. I cannot 
understand at all why somebody should express any doubts about 
it." 
  Vitaliy Churkin said he was sure that this turn of events 
had 
not been a surprise either for the government of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina or for the Muslim side. He expressed the 
hope that in the next few days all the details of the operation 
to open the airport will have been settled so that the airport 
can start to function and humanitarian aid be delivered to the 
population of this area of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  According to the deputy foreign minister "a representative 
of 
the Emergencies Ministry is now in Zagreb after being in 
Belgrade yesterday, because, as you know, that organization is 
still engaged in the delivery of humanitarian goods by land." 
  In this connection he drew attention to the fact that the 
Russians involved in this operation will be not military people 
and not from the Defense Ministry but precisely from the 
Ministry of Civil Defense, Emergencies, and Elimination of the 
Consequences of Natural Disasters, which was formerly the state 
committee for emergencies. They are well trained people. 
According to him the Russian side intends to act strictly 
within the framework of the scheme and the operation being 
prepared by Mr. Akashi and the leaderships of the former 
Yugoslavia itself and Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  As for the agreement on the creation of a Croatian-Muslim 
federation, it should be said that a preliminary agreement has 
been prepared on the creation of a confederation between this 
Croatian-Muslim federation and Serbia. "This has not come as 
news to us," V. Churkin emphasized. "I must express my 
satisfaction at the character of the contacts and consultations 
that we have had with the American side and in particular with 
my American counterpart, envoy Redman, because right from the 
outset he informed me in detail of his plans." "It seems to 
me," he said, "that Chuck Redman is engaged in studying some 
interesting possibilities which might, if they turned out right, 
certainly help the achievement of a Bosnian settlement. I have 
not yet had an opportunity to study the documents in detail, but 
it is a matter of settling a number of aspects of 
Muslim-Croatian relations. If this agreement is correctly 
incorporated within the general context of a settlement in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, it could full well prove useful. However 
this probably requires still closer interaction on our part with 
the Americans and also with the other countries that are 
displaying a keen interest in the problems of achieving a 
Bosnian settlement."

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Ye.N. Podkolzin, commander </F>
of Russian Federation Airborne Troops, by Colonel Aleksandr 
Oliynik; place and date not given: "Colonel General Yevgeniy 
Podkolzin: Our Peacemakers in Bosnia Were Welcomed With Bread 
and Salt. Airborne Troops' Commander Answers Questions From 
KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondent"] 
  [Text] [Oliynik] Yevgeniy Nikolayevich, Russia's 
initiative, thanks to which the threat of a new escalation of 
the war in the Balkans because of the NATO ultimatum has been 
averted, is today being called none other than a "diplomatic 
triumph for the Russians." But when did you yourself learn of 
it? For literally until recently the opposite viewpoint 
prevailed, did it not, in our political leadership and in the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Defense -- not to send our "blue 
helmets" into the Bosnian meat grinder on any pretext? 
  [Podkolzin] Yes, indeed, until very recently both the 
president of Russia and the minister of defense were doing all 
they could to oppose -- I will not fight shy of this word -- the 
use of our "blue helmets" within the framework of the UN 
peacemaking forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Although, as we know, 
there had been quite a few calls for this both from the United 
Nations and from Washington and other Western countries. In my 
view the decisive factor which influenced our policy on the 
Bosnian crisis was not only the tough NATO ultimatum, which, 
incidentally, was announced without consultation with Russia -- 
a permanent member of the UN Security Council -- but the fact 
that the proposed airstrike not only would not have brought 
nearer the peaceful settlement of the crisis but, on the 
contrary, would have led to a new escalation of the war in the 
Balkans and to numerous human casualties. 
  [Oliynik] It is appropriate here to recall also the history 
of World War II in the Balkans. A total of 20 divisions -- 8 
German and 12 Italian -- got stuck in the Bosnian mountains in 
an attempt to crush the Yugoslav partisans' resistance. Tito's 
army not only held out but also triumphed.... 
  [Podkolzin] Exactly. The Balkans are not Iraq, and 
strong-arm methods, as the facts show, do not work here. Before 
playing at war we should think about the consequences of 
military operations for the Balkans and for Europe as a whole. 
As for my own participation in carrying out our initiative, I 
learned of it from a personal conversation with Army General 
Pavel Grachev which I had at 1300 hours 18 February. The 
minister of defense reported that the Russian president had 
decided, in line with an accord with Radovan Karadzic, the 
Bosnian Serb leader, to transfer to Sarajevo part (400 men) of 
our UN battalion stationed in Serb Krajina. In order to 
coordinate operations, on the morning of 19 February I flew out 
to Belgrade and then to Sarajevo together with Vitaliy Churkin, 
the president's special representative, and with officers of the 
Airborne Troops. Incidentally, owing to bad weather Belgrade 
was not receiving flights (visibility was down to zero), and yet 
our pilots managed to land the aircraft after circling five 
times. 
  [Oliynik] We know from television broadcasts and the press 
how enthusiastically the population of Bosnia welcomed the 
column of Russian paratroopers. But I guess this march of 
almost 500 km through the mountains was not easy, was it? 
  [Podkolzin] Of course, this rapid relocation cost the 
soldiers and officers a great effort. For we had not only to 
prepare hardware for the march but also to select the men: The 
contracts of the majority of the paratroopers end in April, and 
they were to have returned home. Then the order came to set out 
for Sarajevo. They must be given their due -- no one was 
frightened by the dangers. At exactly the designated time -- 
1800 hours 20 February -- our armored group headed by Colonel 
Viktor Vorobyev arrived in the Sarajevo region. Moreover, it 
was a mixed column -- in the space of 18 hours 21 armored 
personnel carriers and 40 Ural trucks negotiated six passes on 
the 500-km route and went through a snowstorm, across unfamiliar 
terrain. You can understand our paratroopers' feelings when, 
contrary to expectations, they were greeted with songs, bread 
and salt.... Incidentally, our column was given an enthusiastic 
welcome not only by Serbs but also by Muslims, but this did not 
embarrass the Muslim leaders, who voiced their displeasure at 
this. 
  [Oliynik] Won't our "blue helmets" find themselves in the 
role of a live target at Sarajevo? For, in the event of new 
clashes between the warring sides, they will hardly be stopped 
by the blue UN color of the Russian paratroopers' uniform. In 
addition, direct provocations cannot be ruled out either.... 
  [Podkolzin] This is the most complex and difficult question 
today. Our paratroopers have taken up positions near Trebevic 
and Vraca, from where the Serbs have withdrawn their heavy arms, 
and also around Sarajevo Airport. They find themselves at a 
bullet's distance, as it were, from both warring sides -- 
Muslims and Serbs. Let us be frank -- in the event of a 
large-scale conflict it will not, of course, be possible to 
avoid casualties. At the same time Britain's General Rose, 
commander of the UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, with whom I 
met twice, assured me that he is taking all measures for the 
safety of the contingent of "blue helmets," including the 
Russians. To this end a reinforcement has now arrived in the 
Sarajevo region from the Scandinavian, Jordanian, and Slovak 
battalions stationed in Croatia, as well as two British 
battalions from Central Bosnia. To this it should be added that 
the leaders of the Bosnians and the Serbs assured me and the 
command of the UN forces in Bosnia that they would no longer 
permit large-scale combat operations in the Sarajevo region.... 
  [Oliynik] What can you say about the duration of our 
paratroopers' stay in the Sarajevo region? 
  [Podkolzin] It would be better to ask the politicians about 
this, and not just our politicians. Too much hatred has built 
up in the Balkans during the two-year period of bloodshed, and 
there have been too many casualties to be able to speak of the 
sides' rapid reconciliation. But I am certain of one thing: 
The Bosnian crisis must be resolved by political means alone. 
If we are speaking of the immediate future of our paratroopers 
in this region, it is known that, in accordance with the Russian 
president's decision and with the agreement of the Federation 
Council, an additional troop contingent of 300 men is setting 
out for Bosnia-Herzegovina to participate in the peacemaking 
mission as part of the UN forces. As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has 
already reported, incidentally, our second battalion of "blue 
helmets" will be stationed there. We have also put a proposal 
to the UN Secretariat to increase the number of our officers on 
the staff of the commander of the UN forces in Yugoslavia, which 
is in Zagreb, and on the Sarajevo-based staff of the UN forces. 
  [Oliynik] Having recovered from its shock at the 
galvanization of Russian policy in the Balkans, the West has now 
started saying that, since the NATO ultimatum has taken effect, 
it would not be a bad thing to apply it in other parts of Bosnia 
too. What is your view? 
  [Podkolzin] I am afraid our paratroopers would not suffice 
for all the "hot spots" in Bosnia. I am joking, of course, but 
seriously, the "policy of ultimatums" can hardly be applied -- 
on 21 February the Balkans and maybe also the whole of Europe 
were on the brink of war. We know too well that many wars need 
only a spark to ignite them but are far harder to end. 
  [Oliynik] Incidentally, where were you at 0100 hours 21 
February? 
  [Podkolzin] Despite the fact that our delegation had been 
informed that there would be no bombing strikes, I well knew as 
a military man that the NATO war machine had been set in motion 
and that the most irremediable eventuality might occur. At the 
moment the ultimatum expired (this was 0300 hours, local time, 
21 February) I was on the territory of the hospitable Ukrainian 
UN battalion. Everyone was anxious, and -- I will not hide the 
fact -- when the ultimatum ran out, together with the Ukrainian 
officers (for the majority were serving in our troops only 
yesterday) we raised our glasses to the Russian paratroopers who 
had won a victory in Bosnia without a war. Who knows, it was, 
maybe, thanks to our mobility that all of Europe woke up that 
February morning without a war....

<F P=106> [Maksim Yusin report: "Under Moscow's Pressure the Bosnian </F>
Serbs Are Making Concessions"] 
  [Text] Russian diplomacy is celebrating a new success in 
the Balkan region. At the end of the talks with Andrey Kozyrev, 
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic stated that his forces will 
end the blockade of the airport at the besieged city of Tuzla 
and its starving population will now be able to receive 
humanitarian aid. 
  The West tried long and unsuccessfully to get the Serbs to 
take this step. Karadzic remained firm: The Serbs were afraid 
that the Muslims would use the airport for arms shipments. The 
Serbian weapons deployed in the immediate vicinity of the runway 
could have destroyed any aircraft approaching Tuzla. Since May 
1992 the airport has been virtually inoperative. The 
humanitarian aid convoys have had to be sent overland -- along 
very difficult roads. The several hundred thousand inhabitants 
of the Muslim enclave (including 25,000 Serbs) were in a 
desperate position. In the West there were increasingly 
frequent calls to end the blockade of the airport by military 
means. France officially put forward such a proposal. 
  As in the case of Sarajevo it was Moscow which undertook the 
mediation mission. "Tuzla was one of the most sensitive 
problems on Bosnian territory," Vitaliy Churkin, Russian deputy 
foreign minister, told IZVESTIYA. "We talked with the Serbs for 
a long time about opening the airport so that the accord which 
was reached in Moscow was no surprise." The crucial argument 
which convinced the Serbs to make concessions was Russia's 
readiness to send its observers to Tuzla where they could 
monitor the freight arriving at the airport. "We trust the 
impartiality of the Russians. Their presence is the guarantee 
that the Muslims will not receive weapons instead of food," 
Karadzic stated. 
  The date of the start of the operation has not been 
announced 
yet. In Churkin's words, 50 Russian observers are ready to fly 
to Bosnia in the immediate future. Moscow has promised that the 
first plane carrying humanitarian aid to land at Tuzla airport 
after the lifting of the blockade will be Russian. 
  There are two reasons for the Serbs' compliance. First, the 
persistence of Churkin and Kozyrev. The head of Russian 
diplomacy has acknowledged that the talks with Karadzic, lasting 
over two hours, were difficult. Once again Moscow had to use 
all its influence on the Serbs to persuade them to accept a 
compromise. The second reason is the firmness shown by NATO in 
the skies over Bosnia on Monday: Four planes violated the UN 
no-fly ban and were shot down by U.S. fighters. The Serbs 
realized that the West was prepared for firm action and that 
this time its threats were not empty talk. Moscow, in turn, 
made it clear that it would not enter into confrontation with 
NATO for the Serbs' sake. The Russian reaction to the incident 
in the air was indicative in this respect. The Foreign Ministry 
supported the West and pinned all the blame on the violators of 
the "no-fly zone," although there was hardly any doubt that the 
downed planes were Serbian. 
  By all accounts, Karadzic realized that in the present 
situation stubbornness will cost dear and concessions are 
inevitable. Russia's proposal to send its observers to Tuzla 
enabled Karadzic to save face and at the same time rebuff the 
supporters of the hard line in parliament and the army, who have 
been accusing him of being too soft. 
  Karadzic supported Boris Yeltsin's proposal for a summit 
meeting on Bosnia to be held in Moscow. He let it be known that 
the Serbs could make new compromises. The joint communique 
adopted on the results of the talks reflected that idea although 
it was worded very vaguely: "The Bosnian Serbs will show the 
maximum constructiveness taking into account among other things 
the qualitative criteria of the territorial demarcation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  In the opinion of Russian diplomats, Karadzic is prepared to 
abide by the promise to withdraw the artillery 20 km from 
besieged Sarajevo as NATO is demanding. Admittedly, there have 
been reports lately that the Serbs are not fulfilling their 
obligations and that from time to time their tanks have been 
violating the "prohibited zone." In Moscow, however, they are 
convinced that such incidents are happening against the will of 
the Bosnian Serb leadership, which is not in full control of its 
armed formations.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy commentary: "Growing Level of Activity </F>
To Resolve Bosnian Conflict"] 
  [Text] In recent days some people have started speaking 
with hope and others with apprehension of Russia's increasing 
efforts to achieve a Yugoslav settlement. Certain politicians' 
voices quiver with irritation and even a sense of grievance at 
Moscow's "unilateral" actions which have led to a breakthrough 
in the 22-month-old impasse of the Bosnian crisis. They are 
less keen to talk about the impotence and fruitlessness of their 
own, admittedly, "multilateral" efforts to achieve the same 
overall aims by purely strong-arm methods. 
  Be that as it may, it should be acknowledged tht Russia's 
increasingly active involvement in resolving the Yugoslav crisis 
and Moscow's increasingly constructive role in this process are 
objectively prompting our Western partners to consider, search 
for, and make unorthodox moves. Paris, London, and Washington 
are reluctant to award the laurels of arbiter of the Balkan's 
fate to Russia "without a fight." But Russia is not seeking to 
determine the development of events in the expanses of former 
Yugoslavia single-handedly. Russia has for a long time now been 
persistently urging the Security Council and the major European 
powers to find a coordinated, mutually acceptable way of solving 
the Bosnian conflict. 
  From this standpoint, the accord reached in Moscow between 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic on lifting the siege of the airport in Tuzla 
and its use for the delivery of humanitarian consignments to the 
Muslim population under the supervision of Russian observers is 
an excellent example of actual constructive moves. If the Serbs 
regard the Russians as historical allies and partners and are 
ready to cooperate, if you will, more closely and openly with 
us, thank God for that. If the Muslims and Croats of Bosnia are 
able to achieve peace on the basis of the agreement signed at 
the same time in Washington on creating a federation with the 
support of the Americans or others that is a very fine thing. 
  It is important that the great powers do not succumb to the 
temptation of exploiting the situation in Bosnia solely as a 
stage for demonstrating their place in world politics and 
showing "who's master in the house" rather than actually trying 
to resolve the Bosnians' future. For example, the U.S. 
Administration and its top officials -- for the time being at 
any rate -- are successfully resisting the conservatives' 
accusations that they are making concessions to Russia. 
President Clinton considers -- and with justification -- that 
it is not so important who makes how many initiatives, what 
counts is not the arithmetic of propaganda but the effectiveness 
of the efforts of all the sides involved in settling the crisis. 
  Some Western politicians and commentators in the mass media 
are discussing whether Russia will damage its relations with the 
West to save its Serbian ally? The question is improperly 
formulated, and any kind of answer to it will therefore be 
innacurate too. Here you clearly see an approach characteristic 
of the Cold War era, when the superpowers divided the world up 
into spheres of influence and a whole policy, or even whole 
countries could be categorized as either "ours" or "bad." 
  No, the world is not like that today. And there should be no 
reversion to the old standards. We should therefore regard as a 
good policy not necessarily "ours" but the policy that leads 
objectively to general well-being and victory over common 
misfortunes. Incidentally, Russia has exhibited such an 
approach over the incident involving the planes downed in the 
Sarajevo region. It has not been clarified to date whose planes 
they were, where they took off from, or who piloted them. But 
our country firmly supports the UN-approved stance on the 
unacceptability of any side employing aircraft for combat 
purposes in the skies above Bosnia. (The aircraft downed by the 
Americans, no wreckage of which has yet been seen (!), are 
claimed to be Yugoslav-made G-2 Galeb or G-4 Supergaleb light 
jet trainers. The former Yugolav People's Army was equipped 
with them and they can be used as ground-attack aircraft. 
  The fact that the first real successes of the peacemaking 
efforts of the United Nations and its contingent in former 
Yugoslavia and the parallel moves of Moscow and Washington have 
also necessarily showed up the worth of people in the Bosnian 
leadership and what their true aims are is another matter. Thus 
Ejup Ganic, vice president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, 
for example, has stated that the opening of the airport at Tuzla 
is "an insult to the United Nations," as it will be carried out 
by Russians. That is to say, what is important to Ganic, is it 
not, is not a positive result but the actual process of the 
struggle for it? He does not want to see Russian soldiers 
wearing Blue Berets in his republic, as they, Ganic said in a 
BBC interview, will bring "Russia's internal problems" to Bosnia.

non-resumption of the hostilities will be worked out during 
further talks. Oganesyan expressed hope that the initiative 
will establish a long-awaited peace in the region. 
  A spokesman for the defence army of Nagorno Karabakh has 
told 
Interfax that, contrary to the ceasefire agreement, Azeri troops 
fired at Karabakh positions Tuesday. Obeying the command's 
order on ceasefire, Karabakh troops did not retaliate.

  [Excerpts] Kiev, March 3 (AFP) -- Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk leaves Thursday for an official visit to the 
United States expected to focus on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament 
and on prospects for US investment on the former Soviet 
republic. Kravchuk will "probably" use the visit to exchange 
letters ratifying the START-I strategic arms reduction treaty, 
said Anton Bouteiko, the president's adviser for international 
relations. 
  US and Ukrainian officials will also discuss the "practical 
implementation" of a tripartite agreement on nuclear weapons 
signed on January 14 in Moscow by Kravchuk and US and Russian 
Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, according to 
Bouteiko. The agreement calls for a total denuclearisation of 
Ukraine, which inherited Soviet nuclear weapons along with 
Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus. [passage omitted] 
  "The main purpose of this visit to encourage economic and 
trade relations between Ukraine and the United States. We are 
not asking for aid but we want to attract investments," Bouteiko 
said. The Ukrainian delegation will propose 24 economic 
projects which are open to US investors, he said. Kravchuk will 
also meet senior officials of the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund. He will be accompanied to 
Washington by interim Prime Minister Efim Zviaginsky, Defence 
Minister Vitaly Radietsky and Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko.

  [Text] Moscow March 2 TASS -- "Russia and Ukraine have 
finally begun real implementation of the tripartite 
Russo-U.S.-Ukrainian agreement "on conditions of the elimination 
of nuclear weapons in Ukraine" signed by Boris Yeltsin, Leonid 
Kravchuk and Bill Clinton in Moscow on January 14," the 
newspaper TODAY [SEGODNYA] reported with reference to "more than 
reliable sources." 
  "In accordance with the agreement, 60 warheads removed with 
precautions from strategic missiles of the 46 missile troops 
division of the 43d missile army were placed on platform cars of 
a special letter-marked echelon and sent to Russia," the 
newspaper said. On Wednesday, the train loaded with the special 
cargo is expected to arrive at a plant located in one of closed 
compounds of the Ministry of Atomic Energy in the Urals, where 
the warheads had been once assembled and where they are 
currently being dismantled," the newspaper said. 
  The newspaper described the move as the first tangible 
result 
of the Russo-U.S. partnership. "Ukraine still possesses around 
2,000 nuclear warheads, but there is a hope that this problem 
will be finally resolved," the newspaper said.

  [Text] Ukrainian Vice Premier Valeriy Shmarov has described 
as disinformation a report by the Moscow SEGODNYA newspaper 
alleging that the nuclear warheads of ICBM's deployed in Ukraine 
have already been transferred to Russia. The first batch of 
missiles will be sent to Russia in the next few weeks, he told 
reporters in Kiev. 
  Shmarov said that as soon as Russia gives the green light to 
the delivery of nuclear fuel to Ukraine, "we will give the green 
light to the transfer of nuclear warheads". He said there was 
no signal from Russia yet. 
  The SEGODNYA newspaper referring to well-informed sources 
reported on Wednesday that a trainload of Ukrainian nuclear 
warheads was due to arrive at a closed town in the Urals on 
March 2. It maintains that the first 60 nuclear warheads were 
dismantled in the last days of February from the ICBM's deployed 
by the 43rd missile army which is stationed in Ukraine.

  [Text] Kiev -- A framework agreement between the 
Governments of Ukraine and Japan "On cooperation in eliminating 
nuclear weapons in Ukraine and setting up a cooperation 
committee" was signed at Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry on 2 
March. On behalf of the Ukrainian side the agreement was signed 
by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and on behalf of 
the Japanese side by Japan's ambassador to Ukraine Shoji 
Suezawa. "This is the first agreement between Japan and 
independent Ukraine since the establishment of diplomatic 
relations between our two states in 1992. Japan hopes Ukraine 
will confidently travel the road of rejecting nuclear weapons 
and will accede to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a non 
nuclear state," Suedzawa stated. Zlenko pointed out that Japan 
was one of the first countries to have signed such an agreement. 
In his view, "this document will promote stronger cooperation 
between our countries. The signing of this agreement is a 
certain contribution to implementing the trilateral statement by 
the Ukrainian, U.S. and Russian presidents, signed on 14 
January." 
  A UNIAN correspondent has been informed by the Japanese 
Embassy in Ukraine that the final sum of Japanese aid to 
eliminate nuclear weapons in Ukraine has not been determined yet.

  [Text] The Ukrainian and Belarusian Defense Ministries 
concluded an agreement on cooperation in the military sphere. 
This was decided during a working meeting between Ukrainian 
Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetsky and Belarusian Defense 
Minister Pavel Kozlovskiy in Lvov yesterday. 
  The ministers said at a press conference on the results of 
the negotiations that after the Soviet single armed forces had 
collapsed, their equipment and property had been divided. 
According to the ministers, there were not enough funds to 
acquire new equipment, which makes the two states seek closer 
cooperation in all military areas. For instance, the agreement 
provides for exchange of military equipment between the two 
states. However, the defense ministers stressed that this did 
not mean unification of the Ukrainian and Belarusian armies. 
Neither did it provide for restoration of a single command. 
  Radetskiy pointed out that Ukraine had declared its 
sovereignty and non-participation in military blocks and that it 
regarded the military cooperation only as a bilateral one. 
Ukraine will take part in military cooperation within the CIS 
only as an observer. 
  Commenting on the issue concerning nuclear weapons in 
Ukraine, Radetskiy emphasized that Ukraine would carry out the 
January 14 trilateral agreement between the U.S.A., Russia and 
Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian defense minister, the terms 
for withdrawal and dismantling of the nuclear weapons have 
already been set.

  [Text] Nikolayev March 2 TASS -- It is impossible to finish 
the aircraft carrier Varyag according to its original design, 
but it may be converted into a floating airfield, Igor 
Ovdiyenko, director of the Black Sea shipyards, said. This 
would agree with Russia's plans and tactical and strategical 
goals, he added. Ukraine cannot afford financing the 
construction of the ship alone. Meanwhile, the Varyag is 
blocking the embankment, creating problems and incurring new 
expenses. The project has already cost the budget a pretty 
penny and it would be absurd to scrap the ship. Shipyard 
officials are now in Kiev to discuss the future of the ship.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] President Aliyev had private talks in Baku on 
Tuesday with Ambassador Vladimir Kazimirov, the Russian 
president's special envoy to the talks on Karabakh, and with 
Georgiy Kondratiyev, a Russian Defence Minister's Assistant. In 
an interview with Interfax, Aliyev's spokesman Tofik Abbasov has 
described the talks as productive. In his words, the Russians 
were familiarized with Baku's attitude toward a settlement. He 
said that Moscow's plan for a settlement took Azerbaijan's view 
only partially into account. 
  In his words, Aliyev wants the belligerents to stop fire 
immediately, withdraw their troops, get down to negotiations. 
However, all these steps should be backed up by the pull out of 
Armenian forces from the occupied Azerbaijani lands, the 
guaranteed return of refugees to Karabakh and other seized 
territories, and their subsequent safety. 
  Asked by Interfax whether Baku agrees to cease fire this 
month in line with the protocol signed in Moscow on February 18 
by the defence ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan with a 
Karabakh representative through Russia's mediation, Abbasov 
explained that these documents are not binding but are only a 
document of intent, which could take effect only after a 
presidential visa. 
  So far Aliyev has not signed the accords, but, as Abbasov 
believes, Azerbaijan's official consent to a truce is possible. 
IF Note: According to the Moscow protocol, a cease-fire in 
Karabakh is to be followed by a disengagement of troops by the 
warring sides and by a pull out of military hardware from the 
zone of fighting. Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Karabakh are 
to post inspectors in the corridor that will form to monitor 
compliance with the protocol. 35 mixed monitoring teams are to 
be deployed in three zones, including the Kelbajar, Agdam, 
Fizuli, Jebrail, and Zangelan regions of Azerbaijan. Food will 
be supplied to Karabakh through the Lachin Pass. Russia's 
Defence Minister Pavel Grachev warned that if this accord on a 
settlement in Karabakh were wrecked, he would resign as a 
mediator.

remain the same. Armenia must withdraw its troops from all 
occupied territories and only after that can we begin 
negotiations concerning the status of Nagorno Karabakh. 
  Jan Eliasson mentioned that the "settlement of the conflict 
must be just and based on the principles of international 
norms". Eliasson said that when preparing for his mission, he 
visited Ankara and Moscow and discussed the steps on the 
settlement of the conflict there as well. In addition, he said 
that "we have to move step by step. The first step is a 
cease-fire, a withdrawal of troops from occupied territories and 
the resumption of communication and beginning of talks 
concerning political settlement".

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] President Geydar Aliyev's visit to Britain attracted 
international attention. His visit is important in terms of 
exposing the true nature of Armenia's aggression against 
Azerbaijan. 
  President Aliyev delivered a speech in the Institute for 
International Relations. He explained issues relating to 
Azerbaijan's independence, the new stage in relations between 
Azerbaijan and Britain, Azerbaijan's new state structure, and 
the Republic's new foreign policy. Geydar Aliyev also explained 
in detail Armenia's aggressive war against Azerbaijan. Several 
members of his audience asked him questions on various issues. 
We want to brief you on the questions and Aliyev's replies. 
One question was as follows: President Ter-Petrosyan said, 
when he visited this country two weeks ago, that the Azerbaijani 
Government is reluctant to guarantee the security of Armenians 
in Karabakh. He stressed that the Armenians in Karabakh are 
struggling for their security. Can you comment on that? 
  Aliyev replied: The information Ter-Petrosyan has conveyed 
to you is wrong. I stress that Azerbaijan fully guarantees the 
security of the Armenian people in Karabakh. The Armenian 
military forces have occupied 20 percent of Azerbaijan's 
territory. They must withdraw. Only after Armenia's withdrawal 
can the issue of guaranteeing the Armenian people's security be 
discussed. A war is being fought on Azerbaijan's territory. 
  Another question was: The Armenian and Azerbaijani people 
have been involved in bloody disputes since the ninth century. 
Can't the two sides make territorial concessions. For example, 
has any proposal been made in the talks between the two sides to 
join Karabakh with Armenia and the area between the Nakhichevan 
Autonomous Republic and Azerbaijan with your republic? Aliyev 
gave a very clear reply. He said: No one knows how long the 
dispute has continued between the two sides. But I don't 
believe we need to study the history of the region. A glance at 
historic facts does reveal that part of Armenia belonged to 
Azerbaijan in the past. I can point to the territory that 
belonged to Azerbaijan on a map. It is known as Zangezur. That 
area belonged to Azerbaijan in the past. Zangezur is a historic 
part of Azerbaijan. It was transferred to the Armenians in 
1920. In short, a glance at history will reveal that the 
Armenians must return many things to Azerbaijan. We covet no 
part of Armenia's territory. 
  Aliyev was asked: A glance at history will reveal that [word 
indistinct] countries have the right to outline their views and 
voice their demands. But everyone knows that the dispute began 
after former President Gorbachev sent Aganbegyan to Paris. He 
informed the Armenians in Paris that Karabakh must be united 
with Armenia. A dispute with the Armenians in Azerbaijan did 
not exist before then. It seems that Moscow and the local 
residents in Karabakh must be blamed for the dispute. If that 
is the case, then they must be blamed for the war. Can you 
assess this? Aliyev replied: The people of Armenia and 
Azerbaijan have had friendly relations and existed peacefully 
for decades. True, the academician Aganbegyan said in Paris in 
November 1987 that Karabakh must be united with Armenia. He 
also said that Gorbachev gave his consent. That kindled the 
bloody war. History will blame those who are responsible for 
the dispute, regardless of who they are. They will be tried by 
the people soon. The claim that the Armenians in Karabakh alone 
are waging a war against Azerbaijan is wrong. The Karabakh 
population is not even 100,000 people. How can 100,000 people, 
including the elderly, women, and children, carry out combat 
operations? How can 100,000 Armenians force 1 million 
Azerbaijani people to become refugees? Undoubtedly, the issue 
is Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan. 
  There is another question that our listeners will find 
interesting: Can you comment on how you assessed Iran's 
proposal to mediate? We hope you can also assess Iran's 
relations with Armenia and Azerbaijan. Has Azerbaijan achieved 
progress in its policy on Iran? Aliyev replied: Normal 
relations exist between Azerbaijan and Iran. Due to the policy 
maintained by the former Azerbaijani Administration, our 
relations could not be described as normal until recently. No 
problem exists right now. Iran and Azerbaijan have established 
very favorable relations. So Iran has revealed that it can 
mediate between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Iran has appealed to 
Armenia in that regard. But we are convinced that mediation by 
one country cannot be successful in such a complex situation. 
The effort by international organizations must be united. We 
have rejected no mediation effort by any country. 
  Dear listeners, we hope the war will end quickly, that peace 
and security will be established, and that the Armenian 
occupiers will withdraw from the occupied territories, but 
Armenia has not [word indistinct]. President Geydar Aliyev's 
visit to France and Britain has enabled the Western countries to 
establish the identity of the aggressor. Misleading people is 
no longer possible.

  [Text] Moscow March 3 TASS - The Azerbaijan Army units 
backed by armour and artillery launched an attack Thursday 
morning and broke through the Karabakh defence lines advancing 
towards the town of Fizuli. According to a source in the 
Karabakh administration, both sides suffer considerable losses 
while the Karabakh forces try to neutralize the enemy and push 
it back to the initial position. A Karabakh official has 
accused Azerbaijan of violating the Russia-brokered ceasefire 
from March 1.

  [Text] Moscow, 2 Mar -- During the last 24 hours the 
Azerbaijani side has again violated the armistice mediated by 
the Russian defense minister, the NKR's [Nagorno-Karabakh 
Republic] information and press department told ITAR-TASS today. 
  Quoting the press service of the NKR defense army, it said 
that during the 24-hour period, in spite of the cease-fire 
agreement which came into force on 1 March, Azerbaijani 
artillery repeatedly shelled Karabakh defensive positions in the 
north of Mardakertskiy Rayon. Last night, the same source says, 
Azerbaijani infantry attacked Karabakh positions at the village 
of Berdashen in Martuninskiy Rayon. The attack was beaten off. 
This morning positions along the line between the villages of 
Dastakert and Tonashen in Mardakertskiy rayon were also shelled. 
In view of this Stepanakert fears that the other side may use 
the armistice to prepare for a new, large-scale offensive. The 
command of the NKR defense army has instructed its forces not to 
retaliate, if possible.

  [Text] Karen Baburyan, acting chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, expressed concern due 
to Azerbaijan's wish to join the NATO program Partnership for 
Peace. In his letter to NATO General Secretary Manfred Werner, 
sent Tuesday, Baburyan asks to take into consideration the fact 
that "Azerbaijan's leadership does not intend to reject its 
aggressive policy" while considering this issue. 
  As Baburyan said, Baku's torpedoing of the CSCE peaceful 
initiatives and other peacemaking efforts aimed at the 
settlement of this conflict testifies to this fact. "We are 
especially concerned over Baku's attempt to internationalize the 
conflict, involving extremist forces into it," emphasizes the 
letter. Azerbaijan's joining the NATO Partnership for Peace 
program without the policy of this state changing can discredit 
noble goals, aggravate the situation in this region, and could 
lead, in general, to undesirable consequences, concludes the 
message.

  [Text] The closed negotiations between Azerbaijani 
President Geydar Aliyev and the Russian delegation ended in Baku 
on Tuesday with no concrete results. The Russian delegation 
included the Russian president's envoy Vladimir Kazimirov and 
Deputy Russian Defense Military Georgiy Kondratyev. 
  According to well-informed sources close to the president's 
office, the Azerbaijani party pointed out that the formula of 
settlement being worked out during the negotiations did not pay 
appropriate attention to the Azerbaijani position. For 
instance, no concrete terms for withdrawal of the Armenian 
troops from the occupied Azerbaijani territories were mentioned. 
  The Azerbaijani president stressed that Baku stood for 
immediate ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh, for troop withdrawal 
and for negotiations. However, he believes this must be carried 
out along with the Armenian troop withdrawal and return of 
refugees to these regions. Azerbaijani also seeks guarantees 
for security of returning refugees.

  [Text] Baku, March 2 (TURAN) -- This morning police armed 
with machine guns continued to control the building of the 
headquarter of the PFA [Popular Front of Azerbaijan]. Employees 
of the PFA have still not been permitted to enter the building. 
The order was given by Mr. Allahyarov, the Chief of Baku's 
Sabail District department of police. 
  Yesterday, the police searched the building for the entire 
day. According to the Deputy Chairman of the PFA, Arif Aliyev, 
all doors and most furniture were damaged by the police. 
Moreover, all telephones and computers were stolen. 
  Nakhichevan's sources told TURAN that yesterday the police 
suggested that the employees of the Nakhichevani branch of the 
PFA should leave the building. The same sources report that a 
special regiment of police was sent to the Ordubadskiy Region in 
Nakhichevan. As is known, presently the leader of the PFA, 
Abulfaz Elchibey, lives near there. All those facts cause 
further tension in Nakhichevan. 
  Meanwhile, the opposition is still subjected to persecution 
in Baku. This morning, the policemen removed the employees of 
Nasimi District branch of the PFA from their building. At the 
same time, official mass media waged a smear campaign against 
the opposition. "The enemies of the Azerbaijani nation must be 
punished", reports Azeri television.

district of the republic in the flat of the National Deputy of 
Azerbaijan Tahir Kerimli, the former chairman of the Surpreme 
Court, a search was conducted by the local police. Notifying

flat had no warrant from the procurator's office permitting the 
search. According to him, the search took place at 2:00 a.m. 
The police insulted the members of his family. He also noted 
that as a result of the search a few bullets belonging to his 
hunting rifle and a kitchen knife were confiscated. Kerimli 
sees this action as the violation of his civil rights and his 
rights as a deputy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the Russian </F>
Federation State Duma, by Valentina Nikiforova, under the 
general heading "Spring. Another Thaw in Russia?"; place and 
date not given: "Ivan Rybkin, Chairman of the Russian 
Federation State Duma: On Amnesty Without Hysteria"] 
  [Text] Hardly had the cell doors closed behind those 
accused of the events of September-October last year than the 
State Duma came under fire: "They have released the criminals!" 
"They have intervened in the president's prerogative!" 
Prosecutor A. Kazannik, admittedly after a slight delay, called 
the State Duma decree on the amnesty "the most shameful page in 
the history of Russian parliamentarism." 
  What actually happened? Your PRAVDA correspondent put that 
and other questions to Ivan Petrovich Rybkin, chairman of the 
State Duma. 
  [Rybkin] One has to view the amnesty calmly and without 
hysteria. The Duma adopted two decrees on the amnesty in 
connection with the adoption of the Constitution on the 
president's initiative. The first decree allows a little over 
20,000 people to be released from their places of confinement 
and around 200,000 people on probation. The second decree -- on 
the economic and political amnesty -- will set 20 times fewer 
people free. The point of the amnesty is that all those who 
have erred are being given a chance to enter life at a quite 
difficult and critical time. The aim is to consolidate society 
so as to pull the country out of chaos by joint efforts. 
  [Nikiforova] It is a humane act. After all, the idea of the 
amnesty came from the president himself and was supported by 
virtually all factions in the Duma. 
  [Rybkin] That clearly does not suit those who look forward 
to clashes between the branches of power, between the State Duma 
and the Federation Council, and between the president and the 
Federal Assembly. But I think that we -- the deputies and the 
executive -- are intelligent enough not to organize 
Russian-style gladiatorial contests for everyone else's 
entertainment. My advice is not to wait with malicious relish 
until the pendulum swings the other way but to remember that we 
are fellow countrymen. 
  [Nikiforova] Nevertheless, they are accusing the Duma of 
haste. 
  [Rybkin] I do not believe that. We did a lot of work in 
committees. As for the procedure for the application of the 
decree, we discussed it with the Interior Ministry. The general 
prosecutor asked for clarification -- and members of the 
committees on legality and security clarified every point. They 
worked on Friday and Saturday. 
  [Nikiforova] But on Saturday people were already coming out 
of jail, in other words they were released immediately. That 
clearly was alarming. 
  [Rybkin] But that is just the beginning. No amnesty is an 
instantaneous act. There are different situations, they have to 
be examined. And an adequate time limit is set for this -- six 
months. 
  [Nikiforova] How do you assess the general prosecutor's 
conduct? 
  [Rybkin] It is vexing that A. Kazannik has behaved so 
inconsistently. He knew that the decree on the amnesty had 
been adopted as part of a package in which the main 
document is the "Memorandum on Accord," signed on 22 February by 
all the factions, even Russia's Choice (although unfortunately 
the next morning, 23 February, they changed their stance). Now 
when a mountain of work has been dumped on the General 
Prosecutor's Office -- work that is necessary for society (it 
must be cleansed and stabilized) -- the general prosecutor is 
resigning. The new man will need time to settle in. 
  [Nikiforova] Ivan Petrovich, are those who have been 
amnestied completely exonerated? 
  [Rybkin] That is a difficult question. In adopting the 
decree the deputies created an area of accord. In consenting to 
this release, those under investigation wrote a statement to 
that effect. For them that is a serious warning. It is no 
coincidence that the Criminal Code includes amendments 
increasing punishments which coincide with those contained in 
the articles of the decree on the amnesty.

  [Text] Russia's Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin 
reported to INTERFAX that the session of CIS Coordinating 
Consultative Committee (CCC) underway on Tuesday in Moscow 
approved the draft agreement on Ukraine's joining the Treaty on 
Economic Union of CIS countries as an associate member. 
  Shokhin, who chaired the session, said the problems related 
to Kiev's joining of the economic union are largely caused by 
the political situation in this republic, in particular, by the 
fact that a new parliament would apparently ratify a 
corresponding agreement. To this effect the minister reminded 
that based on CIS documents already ratified by Kiev, at the 
Commonwealth's forums, Ukraine enjoys the right of a decisive 
and in several cases of a consultative vote. 
  As Shokhin asserted, Kiev "has no reserved special positions 
on articles of the treaty on economic union." "Ukraine's 
peculiar feature is that it is closer to plenipotentiary than to 
a classic associate membership in the economic union," stressed 
the minister. He added that the CCC had proposed a general 
variant of the draft agreement on associate membership with 
respect to Ukraine. 
  Ivan Korotchenya, CIS executive secretary, made it clear 
during his conversation with our INTERFAX correspondent that a 
common principal accord was voiced on the issue of Ukraine's 
associate membership in the economic union at the CCC session. 
However, experts have been charged with also developing a text 
of an appropriate document. Korotchenya explained that due to 
the fact that Kiev had not signed the CIS Charter and the Treaty 
on Economic Union, because Ukraine had expressed its discontent 
with several of the Treaty's provisions, there appear certain 
difficulties and contradictions due to the preparation of an 
agreement on associate membership of this republic in the 
economic union. 
  Korotchenya added that "there is not a single completely 
prepared document among those approved at the CCC session 
Tuesday, all of them are to be revised by experts." Korotchenya 
reported that majority of CCC members are in favor of a joint 
conference on March 31 in Moscow instead of two separate 
sessions, namely of the Council of heads of governments and 
Council of heads of states.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 3 (ITAR-TASS) -- Under the headline 
"What Will the Prime Minister Offer?", today's ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 
newspaper forecasts a scenario of an upcoming government meeting. 
  In the newspaper's opinion, Viktor Chernomyrdin "will 
possibly submit to the meeting mechanisms for implementing ideas 
outlined in the recent state of the nation message by President 
Boris Yeltsin to the Russian parliament". 
  The same newspaper quotes opinions expressed by two members 
of the presidential council -- full member of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences Andrey Zhukov and politologist Leonid 
Smirnyagin concerning priority tasks facing the Russian 
Government. 
  Zhukov calls on the cabinet "to concentrate on the economy 
and ignore political discussions", while Smirnyagin calls for 
ending "a war between regions and the centre for rights which 
have already been granted to them". 
  The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper carries a monthly rating 
of 
100 leading Russian politicians in February, based on polls 
carried by the public opinion agency "VP" together with the 
newspaper. The latest poll shows that the Russian president 
yielded the first place to his Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
  The same newspaper also devotes its commentary to the 
Russian 
cabinet head. The newspaper expresses ideas on the role played 
by the present premier in pursuing the course of reforms and 
economic changes in the country. 
  In the newspaper's opinion, the present "pre-reform economy 
is in the premier's 'charge', while Chernomyrdin, the newspaper 
notes, "is born for a situation when Russia gets a respite 
before an advent of a new, and luckier than Gaydar, economic 
reformer". 
  Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the lower chamber committee on 
economic policy, analyses in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA "compatibility" 
of the positions of the president and parliament after the 
recent message by Yeltsin to legislators. 
  In his opinion, "Russia's deindustrialisation is now an 
established fact". Nevertheless, "virtually all theses of the 
presidential message coincide with the recommendations of 
parliamentary hearings on economic policy". 
  The press points with concern to a rash of strikes in Russia 
over the past few days. The newspapers SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, TRUD 
and ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI write about "a wave of strikes" that swept 
the country. 
  In this connection, TRUD says the following: "The 
government's numerous promises to tackle social and economic 
problems of coal- mining regions have not been fulfilled. This 
provoked a new phase of tention at mines. 
  "A pre-strike situation is observed at many enterprises. 
Steelmen, textile workers and personnel at defence and light 
industry factories have set up striking committees." 
  The PRAVDA newspaper features an interview with former 
Russian parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov who recently left 
the Lefortovo Prison in Moscow after the amnesty declared by the 
lower house of the Russian parliament. 
  He stressed that he "reserves the right to tell truth to 
people how the former Russian parliament worked and how we 
defended principles of democracy and parliamentarism, as well as 
to tell truth what really happened during the tragic days of 
September- October 1993".

<F P=106> [Article by Uzbek President I. Karimov: "Islam Karimov: We </F>
Are Reliable Partners"] 
  [Text] History itself has predestined Uzbekistan to be at 
the crossroads of the main roads in Eurasia linking West and 
East, South and North. Our republic can become a Eurasian 
economic and cultural bridge where preconditions are created for 
the movement and exchange of goods, technologies, investment, 
and cultural assets. 
  Amid the breakdown of the once unified financial and 
monetary-credit systems, the severing of economic ties, and 
galloping inflation Uzbekistan found itself in a difficult 
starting position two years ago, which set us two complex tasks: 
On the one hand, we had to implement the in-depth reforms 
involved in the transition to a market economy and, on the 
other, adopt urgent measures to stabilize the economy and 
prevent a drastic drop in the population's prosperity. 
  In these conditions, in order to overcome the grave legacy 
of 
the past, enable the all-around transformation of the economy, 
and secure economic independence for Uzbekistan based on 
historical, national specific conditions, our people's way of 
life and mentality that have developed over the centuries, and 
at the same time the difficult experience gleaned by countries 
that have covered this thorny route, we chose our own means of 
development based on five basic principles, which boil down to 
the following: 
  the priority of the economy over politics. At the same time 
both domestic economic strategy and foreign economic relations 
must be completely rid of the influence of any political 
ideology; 
  the regulating role of the state as the initiator of 
economic 
reforms and the main implementer thereof. Since it is 
accountable for choosing strategic priorities in the economy and 
shaping a legal base and assists in forming and developing 
entrepreneurial and reforming state managerial structures as 
well as credit, tax, and currency policy and creating conditions 
to attract investment, and prepare the population for reforms; 
  the supremacy of the law in all spheres of public life; 
  the implementation of a strong social policy designed to 
protect the population, particularly socially vulnerable groups, 
the disabled, children, and large families. The state can only 
consider itself humane when it can defend its population, 
particularly during the crucial transitional period; 
  a phased transition to the market. 
  The real economic situation, specific demographic 
conditions, 
and the low standard of living of the overwhelming number of 
families make the "shock therapy" route unacceptable for the 
republic during the transition to the market. Time is needed to 
change the organizational, economic, and financial-credit 
systems, create the appropriate legal base and a market 
infrastructure, and train cadres. 
  Uzbekistan has a wealth of natural economic and mineral raw 
material resources. Prospected stocks of over 750 kinds of 
mineral resources alone are estimated at around $3 trillion. 
  Today we have a program and a fairly clear idea of how to 
implement reforms in the republic. Our domestic policy is 
geared to a gradual phased transition to a socially oriented 
market economy which precludes revolutionary upheaval and the 
mass impoverishment of the people. 
  Reforms are not an end in themselves for us but a means of 
really giving broad strata of the population access to property, 
reviving the sense of ownership, and creating on this basis the 
conditions for the development of initiative and enterprise. 
  The Uzbek Constitution well and truly paves the way for 
market relations, ensures freedom of enterprise, and prevents 
the state having the monopoly to interfere in economic activity. 
Our Fundamental Law stresses that private ownership comes under 
state protection. 
  We regard the stage-by-stage implementation of reforms as a 
necessary condition for the preservation of sociopolitical 
stability. But it is also true that the very stability of the 
situation in turn enables reforms to be carried out in a 
well-considered, well-gauged manner without artificially 
speeding events up for political motives. 
  The implementation of a strong social policy is a clear 
priority during all stages of reform and a guarantor of its 
irreversibility for us. Over the years of independence a new 
mechanism of social protection has in effect been created for 
the population, oriented to targeted support for the most needy 
strata during the transition to the market. 
  This has been reflected in a guaranteed minimum wage and 
pension, the organization of rationed supply of the most 
important foodstuffs, the provision of compensatory payments, 
etc. 
  Attaching great importance to deepening multilateral 
cooperation between the republics of the former Union, 
Uzbekistan from the outset supported the idea of forming the 
Commonwealth of Independent States. We think that its potential 
has by no means been exhausted. The Treaty of Economic Union 
reveals good prospects in this respect. At present there is the 
task of ensuring the real fulfillment of the provisions 
enshrined therein. 
  While cooperating within the CIS framework, we do at the 
same 
time attach great importance to the process of integration 
within the Central Asian region. Considerable progress has been 
made here in our relations with the Republic of Kazakhstan and 
Republic of Kyrgyzstan. 
  Needless to say, by no means all our problems have been 
resolved, we still have a very difficult life. Over the 
previous decades our republic's economy developed a great 
dependence on imports of a wide range of output and consumer 
goods. The severing of economic ties and the worsening of the 
payment problem owing to unilateral actions taken by certain 
circles to bring down the ruble zone are having a painful effect 
on many of our enterprises and the economy as a whole. 
  Of course, it would be wrong in present-day conditions to 
raise the question of literally reviving all the economic ties 
on which the old Union-wide division of labor was based. It is 
a question of preserving partnership in mutually beneficial 
spheres and organizing new ties in order to ease for each state 
not only the process of economic stabilization, but also its 
structural reorganization in line with the inexorable 
requirements of the world market. 
  The move to international principles of settlement has 
considerably reduced our once extensive links with partners in 
East Europe. Whereas in 1990 CEMA countries accounted for 
around 60 percent of Uzbekistan's exports, these days they 
account for less than 8 percent. However, we have no intention 
of abandoning procurements of transport systems from the Czech 
Republic, medicines and food from Hungary, and certain kinds of 
agricultural produce from China. 
  The current stage of economic reforms involves the 
considerable liberalization of foreign economic relations. It 
is envisaged that customs duties on imports of all kinds of 
goods will be abolished, export duties reduced, and a 
competitive procedure for licensing exports from the republic 
introduced; a state insurance company for Uzbek and foreign 
investments has been set up to which some of Uzgoskhran's assets 
will be transferred. All this creates a good base for 
expanding our cooperation and for jointly resolving the problems 
of overcoming crisis processes.

  [Text] Moscow March 2 TASS -- The "laurels" of Sergey 
Shakhray, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, whose 
faction initiated the adoption of the resolution on political 
amnesty has obviously touched Russian nationalist Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy on the raw. 
  In a statement issued on Wednesday, the faction of his 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia claimed the right to 
Shakhray's laurels. "The party has promised its voters to ensure 
the adoption of this act and it has kept its promise," the 
statement said. 
  However, in his statement on February 23 Konstantin Zatulin, 
secretary of the faction of Shakhray's party in the parliament, 
said that the initiative to adopt the memorandum of accord 
together with the resolutions on amnesty belonged to the Party 
of Russian Unity and Accord. 
  Meanwhile, Shakhray and Zhirinovskiy have been trying to 
distance themselves from the political consequences of amnesty. 
Shakhray said at a session of the State Duma, the lower house, 
that despite his will, "the consistency of the plan of national 
reconciliation was broken." As a result, those pardoned will 
"again dive for political fighting," he said [as received]. 
  Zhirinovskiy noted that his "party is in no way connected 
with the people who have been pardoned under amnesty."

  [Text] In accordance with a presidential decree signed by 
Igor Smirnov, the state of emergency has been prolonged on the 
territory of the self-proclaimed Transdniestrian republic till 
March 31. 
  As it was reported earlier, the state of emergency was 
introduced in Transdniester for one month late January. This 
was officially explained by the need to stabilize the internal 
political situation, exchange bank notes, and to improve the 
economic situation. 
  Independent political observers assess this move as an 
attempt to prevent the Transdniestrian population from 
participation in the elections to Moldova's new parliament 
scheduled for March 27. 
  The decree on prolonging the state of emergency points out 
that this measure is aimed at further stabilization of the 
situation in this region.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 02, BNS -- The state border between 
Estonia and Russia runs along the present so-called 
administrative border, Russia's chief negotiator Ambassador 
Vasiliy Svirin stated at a press conference today. 
  The Russian diplomat said his country's position is based on 
the U.N. resolutions and documents as well as the final act of 
the 1975 Helsinki conference, under the terms of which the 
post-war status quo must be preserved in Europe. Svirin also 
pointed out that the agreement on the principles of bilateral 
relations concluded between Estonia and Russia in 1991 
stipulates that both parties respect one another's territorial 
integrity. 
  Svirin told BNS at the press conference that, if Estonia 
also 
in the future refuses to demarcate the land border, Russia "will 
be forced to do it unilaterally." 
  "Allow me to remind you that Estonia was the first to 
station 
its border guards on the present borderline in 1992," the 
Russian diplomat said. "The border between Estonia and Russia 
runs along its present line, and fruitless discussions about the 
issue may further strain the relations between our countries." 
  Vaino Reinart, head of the Estonian delegation for talks 
with 
Russia, announced that Estonia proposed during the 17th round of 
talks to discuss the border issue and the interpretation of the 
1920 Tartu Peace Treaty in the Hague Court. 
  "Regrettably, the Russian delegation rejected our proposal," 
Reinart said. 
  Svirin affirmed that Russia does not consider it necessary 
to 
take the border issue to the Hague Court. He said, however, 
that Estonia "has of course the right to approach the court."

<F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich at Belarusian </F>
Supreme Soviet session in Minsk, on 1 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] Esteemed people's deputies! At Supreme Soviet's 
request, the government has drafted proposals regarding changes 
within the structure of the Council of Ministers and local 
executive bodies. In my report I would like to both 
substantiate these proposals and inform you about the 
government's standpoint on a number of conceptual problems, 
typical for the transitional period of the state-building 
process in the Republic. Certain circumstances that are vital 
for choosing further ways of developing our state demand a more 
detailed analysis. 
  First: We are standing at a historic crossroads; there is no 
way back, but neither have we definitely chosen a new path. 
Speaking about the crossroads in a simplified way, Belarus has 
to choose its foreign policy orientation between East and West, 
North and South. Some politicians have been trying to treat this 
issue rather inflexibly. In the economy, [we should choose] 
between unrestrained market romanticism with all its deadly 
consequences and social security for the people; between the 
[?ruining] of the industrial and agricultural potential and the 
course of gradual reform directed at building a state with 
controlled socially oriented market relations. These are the 
two primary spheres that cause a division of approaches 
determining the fate of our people and our state. 
  Second: In the sphere of strengthening statehood, stability, 
and accord in society, there also exist two diametrically 
different approaches. One approach provides for the destruction 
of the current basis of the Republic's constitutional structure 
-- that is, the elimination of the institute of soviets of 
people's deputies, the adoption of a law on lustration and its 
introduction into political life. This would amount to a ban on 
the activities of the left and (?other) parties. Strange as it 
might seem, there are attempts to politicize the history of the 
Belarusian nation and to plant Russophobia in the social 
mentality. 
  The other approach is based on common sense and is advocated 
by the Supreme Soviet, the government, and an overwhelming 
majority of our people. It envisions building a democratic 
state of law and a priority nature of an individual. This kind 
of state would rule out violence against an individual; and the 
ideas of national self-awareness would begin to dominate in 
society, based on historic truth and in concurrence with the 
political course pursued by the administration and the 
expectations of a majority of people. I think that nobody will 
negate the fact that since the Republic won independence and the 
CIS was formed, the government had to resolve a number of 
various complicated problems. It was necessary to reduce social 
losses to a maximum, and safeguard [word indistinct], 
humanitarian, and moral aspects of reform, as well as the 
balance between the interests of the Belarusian people and those 
of other CIS citizens and the world community. 
  This is why we have advocated and will continue to advocate 
the policy of sober step-by-step reform directed not against, 
but for the benefit of society. Events and developments in 
other newly independent states, primarily in Russia, have 
affected the rate of changes carried out in our country. Both 
[word indistinct] and Russians are concerned over the problems 
of civil peace and national accord. We understand perfectly 
well that if Russia abandons the policy of integration with CIS 
states, this would inevitably produce political and economic 
cataclysms in both the Commonwealth states and in Russia. Not 
only Belarus is aware of threats to civil peace. That is why our 
ideas to form an economic union and a single financial system 
have finally become the subject of serious negotiations with the 
Russian Government, have attracted the attention of other 
independent states, and have been supported in a recent address 
by the president of the Russian Federation. It is pleasant to 
point out that within the framework of the CIS, alienation, 
economic disintegration, and so-called communal sovereignty are 
being gradually but ever more steadily replaced with trust, 
understanding of common geopolitical interests, and a necessity 
to coordinate industrial and agricultural policies, credit and 
monetary relations, banking, investment, and finance. 
  Relations with the Russian Federation are undoubtedly the 
main foreign policy priority for Belarus. This is a 
well-founded historic choice. It has no alternates because of 
the community of Russian and Belarusian cultures, the common 
interests of these fraternal nations, close integration, and 
former nearness of their industrial potentials and communication 
space. 
  Addressing those who criticize the foreign policy of the 
Belarusian Government, I would like to underline once again that 
Belarus is ardently following the road of reform and building a 
democratic society, and a sovereign state of law, open for 
dialogue with all friendly nations. 
  I am sure that we understand the importance of the historic 
moment experienced by the Republic and cannot tolerate the 
situation in which nationalism and extremism would prevail over 
wisdom, and individual rights and freedoms would depend on 
ethnic origin. 
  Political monopoly of a separate party acting as a prophet 
on 
behalf of the entire nation, is inadmissible. In recent years, 
our society has received a perfect political education and has a 
good understanding of rhetorics. People do not want political 
fuss and promises; they want real improvement of their lives, 
justice, and protection against growing crime. Strong state 
power enjoying people's trust is the main condition for leading 
the Republic out of an economic crisis. We have had a chance to 
see for ourselves that in the period of structural reshaping, 
the state must not fail to control the economic development. 
  [Words indistinct] that in our Republic, where the 
overwhelming majority of enterprises and almost the entire 
agricultural complex are state-run, rapid reform can be 
spontaneous and not supervised by the state. Control over this 
complicated process is probably the main condition for a gradual 
transition to market relations. Proceeding from what I have 
said, the government believes that the economic situation is 
complicated. However, our current hardships are to a great 
extent a result of the high degree of dependence on external 
factors, and can be attributed to the transition to a new-type 
economy. 
  There is a way out of the current situation. The fact that 
the government has not lost control over finance and economy, 
and has prevented a disastrous decline in production and a 
destruction of industries and agriculture, gives ground for 
optimism. Working at the brink of its financial potential, the 
government has managed to maintain a social security system. 
  As for implementing reforms this year, we believe the 
following tasks should be undertaken. One should accelerate 
privatization of small businesses. We are planning to privatize 
about 50 percent of the enterprises operating in trade and 
services; to transform about 50 percent of large state-run 
enterprises into joint stock companies; to hasten work on 
finishing building of uncompleted facilities. One should also 
pursue active antimonopoly policies intended to reveal natural 
and artificial monopolies, their division, and the control over 
price monopolism. [The government should] support private 
initiative by removing bureaucratic obstacles and their 
discriminating policies. The private sector should be developed 
in the quickest way possible to compensate for the inevitably 
shrinking production in the state sector, to increase the 
efficiency of the economy, and to provide jobs for the 
unemployed labor force. In addition, industries must be 
prepared to manufacture only those products for which there is a 
demand. 
  One of the problems that raises the concern of the entire 
society is economic crimes and corruption. The criminal world 
is becoming more professional and equipped with modern types of 
weapons. One cannot help but see that in some CIS countries, 
organized crime poses an immense threat to their national 
security and to the course of reforms. In spite of all our 
mistakes in this extremely sensitive area, let me remind that 
the government declared combating organized crime as one of its 
priorities, and toughened measures to counter this evil. First 
of all, I am talking about the resolutions issued on 24 
September and 25 November 1992. At that time, it was an 
excessive measure, but the government was supported by society 
and, importantly, by you, esteemed deputies. We appreciate your 
support and the fact that later on, the government policies 
found their reflection in laws that you adopted. Also to this 
end, was government resolution No. 711 curtailing circulation of 
foreign currencies. This displayed an understanding that the 
unrestrained circulation of different currencies inflicts 
substantial damages on the Republic. 
  The crime-ridden situation in the Republic calls for a 
reform 
of our law enforcement system, in the first place, the Internal 
Affairs Ministry and the KGB. It is important that their 
functions be divided to avoid duplication. At the same time, I 
am confident that the Internal Affairs Ministry and the KGB 
should definitely be part of the executive branch, providing 
implementation of the main task -- security of the state and the 
protection of its sovereignty and citizens' rights. Combating 
crime must be an integrated and uncompromising process. In 
conjunction with other interested parties, the Cabinet of 
Ministers is completing the preparation of the state program 
providing for urgent anticrime measures. These measures will 
allow to substantially increase the efficiency of all law 
enforcement agencies. The Cabinet of Ministers was given this 
task yesterday at the Security Council meeting, which will then 
be examined by the Cabinet of Ministers Presidium and later by 
the Supreme Soviet Presidium. There is no denying that [words 
indistinct] tasks [words indistinct] improve the structure of 
law enforcement agencies as well. However, this is not the most 
important issue. The key task is to ensure firm governing of 
the state, strict executive discipline, and unconditional 
execution of all decisions by government institutions. For this 
purpose, one should reform power in accordance with [word 
indistinct] and the objectives, clearly define the scope of 
competence of power branches, and ensure their genuine 
independence within legal constrains. Anyone, regardless of 
position, who violates the law and oversteps legal limits must 
be held responsible for his actions. This task should be central 
to the entire judicial and law enforcement system. 
  The fundamental issue raising heated debates in our 
parliament is the issue concerning the structure of government 
institutions. The government resolutely stands for introducing 
the post of president being the head of state and the executive 
branch. Unfounded are the fears of those who think that this 
move could lead to a usurpation of power and dictatorship. To 
avoid this, the draft constitution includes, to my mind, quite 
an effective system of restrains and counterbalances. It is 
based on the system of division of legislative, executive, and 
judicial powers widely accepted throughout the world. Besides, 
one should not forget that our people experienced dramatic 
changes in social consciousness over the past years. The 
people's mentality has changed, and their political activity has 
increased. Today, we have a pretty high degree of freedom, 
including political freedom. In my opinion, it is the free 
people in a democratic and law-governed state that are the 
guarantor preventing the usurpation of power. The legislative 
branch should, of course, counterbalance a strong executive 
branch and independent judicial power. I believe that the new 
constitution provides for a balance among all these branches. 
In a bid to make their relations more stable, the authors of 
the draft proposed that the prime minister, along with his 
deputies, power ministers, and the president, be appointed and 
discharged by the Supreme Soviet. Thus, the draft gives the 
Supreme Soviet control over the government and makes the 
president accountable to it. 
  The relationship between people and power are the most 
important in the process of the political and economic reforms 
which are still under way, even though our opponents claim 
otherwise. The law on self-government and local economies 
passed in February 1991 affects, in the most direct way, the 
rights of citizens, because in their everyday life they have to 
deal with local authorities, and not the parliament or 
government. So they care what those authorities should be like, 
what powers they will have, and to what extent they, the 
citizens, can influence their decisions. The law has been 
passed but we already see its faultiness and isolation from the 
federal system of transformation. This law does not ensure the 
balance of executive power institutions. This task remains 
beyond the competence of the Cabinet of Ministers. However, we 
consider it important to present our point of view. Laws and 
decisions adopted by the parliament and government are not only 
often ignored in the hinterland, but meet with hidden and 
sometimes open resistance. This is caused, first of all, by the 
lack of a clear system of subordination in the government 
institutions, vagueness of competence given to executive bodies, 
and lack of coordination among executive and legislative bodies. 
Thus we need a fundamental restructuring of local executive 
power to define the competence of local governments, ensuring 
more responsibility of government officials for state discipline. 
  What will these representatives of the authorities be 
called: 
local soviets, or perhaps some other name? This makes no 
difference. But there can be some difference. Nevertheless, 
the local soviets should not perform the functions of local 
parliaments, that is, the legislative organs which go against 
the laws of a single unitary state. Life itself shows [words 
indistinct] which should be changed, should be changed. These 
are, primarily, the following: the adoption of economic 
programs and budgets; the establishment of a system of local 
taxation which should correspond to the law; the granting of tax 
breaks that are being collected by local budgets; the legal use 
of natural resources; protection of the environment; the regular 
election of judges, and an entire range of other issues. At the 
same time, it makes sense to preserve the soviets or other 
organs at the level of oblasts, cities, rayons -- except city 
rayons -- while in the city rayons, workmen's settlements, and 
rural settlements there should only be the organs of executive 
power. It is necessary, in our opinion, to promptly reduce the 
staff of the representative bodies. To strengthen the management 
potential of the entire executive branch, we think it necessary 
to elect the chairmen of the local soviets -- who will 
simultaneously be chairmen of the executive committees -- to 
carry out the recommendation of the chiefs of the higher organs 
of the executive branch. By the way, the city executive 
committees are entitled to choose candidates to run in the 
elections for chairmen of oblast soviets. The same procedure 
should be implemented when the chairmen of the oblast soviets 
are dismissed from their posts. The responsibility of local 
soviets, especially in the sphere of municipal property, should 
be streamlined. We have many examples when local soviets, due 
to their specific activities, have stalled privatization and 
even the programs of privatization have been adopted with 
considerable delays from the established terms. We believe that 
the constitution should highlight the main things concerning 
local administration and self-administration, while the 
competence [words indistinct] and the activity of organs of 
local self-administration should be determined by a special law. 
  Let me now move on to the proposal to upgrade the structure 
of the Cabinet of Ministers and its organization. Despite the 
fact that the government has been empowered with specific powers 
in this sphere, I am grateful to the Supreme Soviet for the 
understanding of the acute character of the situation. I 
consider it my duty to inform the Supreme Soviet deputies on the 
essence of the reorganization which is being carried out. 
Because we are living through a transition period, we should be 
aware that the organization of the state power organs cannot 
immediately receive a proper form. While our statehood is 
being developed and we are coming closer to the market, there 
arises the need to set up new organs of power and eliminate old, 
obsolete ones. 
  Reforming the system of executive power is very important 
and is the main direction in our policy in the realm of state 
building. The organization of the Cabinet of Ministers, which 
was formed by the Supreme Soviet in the summer of 1990, has 
already undergone some changes. In the past, the Light, Local, 
and Timber Ministries, the Ministries of Municipal Services, 
Land Improvement and Water Resources, Construction and 
Installation and Special Building Works -- that is, seven 
ministries -- were liquidated. Many functions of these 
ministries were taken over by independent economic entities -- 
concerns and associations. In my opinion, two new concerns will 
be set up on the basis of the Ministry of Industry and Building 
Materials [as heard] and the Ministry of Building and 
Exploitation of Motorways. These considerable changes have 
greatly expanded the functions of some former ministries and 
departments. This allowed republican and local authorities to 
adapt to modern conditions. Though this organization has 
somewhat increased, it does not look as cumbersome as it has in 
the past. Its staff does not exceed 1.3 percent of the total 
number of people employed in the national economy, while in 
Lithuania this percentage is 1.8 and in Ukraine -- 1.4. In 
fact, in 1993, costs for the maintenance of state bodies in the 
framework of the overall republican budget stood at 1.21 
percent, compared to the 1.31 percent predicted in the budget. 
  The main purpose of reform in the sphere of management is to 
completely avoid direct administrative centralized pressure on 
the various domains of economy, to provide opportunities for 
economic entities to act independently, in other words, to 
create a qualitatively new system of administration on the basis 
of global norms. Simultaneously, our task is to preserve state 
regulation of state property. In the Republic's administrative 
system, the central place should be given to a ministry. The 
ministry should actively pursue the government's policy in 
various spheres and have the widest-possible powers. The 
ministry should be relieved of operative-administrative 
functions as much as possible. The number of ministries should 
not be large, but it should allow for an entire range of issues 
to be implemented on the macro level. 
  In this regard, it is necessary to strengthen the state 
administration, to extend the functions of the ministries, and 
to adopt normative acts. Therefore, the government has already 
considerably extended the powers of the ministries and 
departments, has empowered them with greater responsibility in 
the upgrading of the organization of the central bodies, the 
management of property, and the setting up of specific funds at 
the expense of budget and non-budget sources of financing, as 
well as the development of new forms of employment. 
  I will not speak in detail on the proposed changes. I will 
only specify the most important ones. First of all, it goes 
about the restructuring of the State Economic Planning 
Commission and the Ministry of Finance. This is not only a 
change of title or that we take cognizance of the fashion. 
[sentence as heard] The problem is that the present status of 
this department does not correspond to its tasks, does not allow 
for concentration on the development of nationwide economic 
programs, to forecast the most important economic processes, and 
to implement market reforms. In other words, it should become a 
regulator of the Republic's economic life. The organization and 
the functioning of this ministry should perform a dual task: On 
the one hand, it should provide for the management of the entire 
economic complex, and on the other hand, it should develop 
economic policy on the path to market reform. To implement this 
idea, we are planning to set up an independent center of 
economic reforms within the Ministry of Finance. Economic 
researchers, managers of enterprises, entrepreneurs, and 
representatives of other interested parties will participate in 
the work of this center. 
  Taking into consideration the increase in control over 
energy 
resources and the need to concentrate the administration in this 
sphere in one specific department, we deem it necessary to set 
up a Ministry of Fuel and Energy on the basis of the Ministry of 
Energy and the Committee for Energy within the Cabinet of 
Ministers. Thus, all of the complex issues related to energy 
and fuel deliveries will be coordinated by one governmental 
body. We deem it necessary to reform the State Committee for 
Foreign Economic Relations into a corresponding ministry. The 
increased functions of this foreign economic committee demand 
that the issue of its status be adequately resolved. This 
ministry could become one of the key ministries in the sphere of 
foreign economic relations. It should take into consideration 
the importance of attracting hard currency and investments to 
the Republic. 
  To strengthen the power of the Ministry of Finance over the 
nation's entire financial system, the functions of some state 
bodies, including the State Inspectorate of Valuables, the State 
Inspectorate for Insurances [Gosstrakhnadzor], and the State 
Committee for Minting [Gozznak] are being put under its 
jurisdiction. The setting up of a state treasury within the 
Ministry of Finance, to concentrate all the budget means and 
state non-budget funds, is very important. According to the 
decision of the Supreme Soviet, the State Committee for State 
Property is being reformed into the Ministry for State Property 
and Privatization; the State Committee for Ecology -- to the 
Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection, with 
the Department for Protection of Fish on the basis of the Chief 
Department for Protection and Reproduction of Fish and Control 
Over Fishing within the Cabinet of Ministers. After the 
liquidation of the Ministry of Resources, a shareholding 
association is being set up on its basis. The functions of the 
Ministry of Grain Products, which is also liquidated, will be 
performed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs. 
  A Ministry of Culture and Publishing is being set up on the 
basis of the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of 
Culture. The National State Television and Radio Company is 
being reformed into the State Committee for Television and 
Radio. The Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen is 
being liquidated and its functions will be performed by the 
Ministry of Culture and Publishing, the State Committee for 
Labor, and the Defense Ministry. We are planning to set up a 
Committee for Science and Technology which will be charged with 
providing for the scientific grounding of economic reforms. In 
general, we are planning to eliminate 13 ministries and 
departments. This is almost one fourth of the present number. 
It is planned to reduce the staff of the central organs of the 
ministries and departments by 12 percent, or by 800 people. 
This all represents a savings of 1.5 billion rubles [R] -- in 
the terms of yearly salaries -- in December 1993 prices. 
  Now I will say some words about the government bodies. 
Changes in the organization of the state administration 
naturally lead to a reorganization of government bodies. In 
connection with this, the functions of [words indistinct] and 
departments become considerably limited and are primarily handed 
over to the ministries which have independence in the management 
of their branches. In accordance to the new approaches and 
independence, which the ministries will receive, a number of 
branch departments and sections are being liquidated within the 
organization of the government bodies. Simultaneously, other 
bodies will be set up. A Council of Independent Experts will be 
set up within the Office of the Chairman of the Cabinet of 
Ministers. By the way, this opinion is being supported by the 
Confederation of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. In my 
opinion, this will allow for deeper analysis of the 
socioeconomic situation, and the government will be able to 
adopt prompt and precise decisions. 
  New positions corresponding to the new tasks are being 
introduced, and the role and responsibility of advisers is being 
increased. The government's press service will be, or, to be 
more exact, has already been reformed: Today the decree on the 
government's press service was signed. In general, the staff of 
the Cabinet of Ministers is being reduced by 10 percent, which 
represents a savings -- in the terms of yearly salaries -- of 
R100 million in December 1993 prices. The staff of government 
bodies will be reduced by one third and will stand at -- I ask 
you to listen closely to this figure -- some 200 people. I am 
sure that the reorganization of the bodies of the Cabinet of 
Ministers will bring new, fresh staff, highly professional and 
honest people to the new organs. We hope that the 
implementation of the Law on Service in the state bodies -- 
effective 1 March 1994 -- will also serve this aim. As for the 
reduction of staff in oblast, city, and other Soviets, the 
Supreme Soviet has charged the government with resolving this 
issue. However, under current legislation, the Cabinet of 
Ministers has no adequate powers to unify and reduce their 
staff. Currently, we have a situation whereby, for example, the 
staff in one oblast executive committee has 150 people more than 
another. In this connection, the Cabinet of Ministers proposes 
to discuss this issue either at the Supreme Soviet session or at 
the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, and to develop a unified 
organization of local authorities on the condition that their 
staff is reduced by 12-15 percent. 
  Esteemed People's Deputies! I tried to briefly relay the 
stance of the government on the main issues of the life and 
activity of our state. I hope that our approach will find 
mutual understanding among the majority of those who are present 
here and, as a result, decisions will be adopted which will 
allow you to more decisively and efficiently build our state, 
reform the organs of power and administrative, and create a 
socially oriented market economy. 
  Today, we are living through difficult times. However, we 
should not dramatize the situation too much. We have the most 
important and meaningful assets: extremely laborious people and 
an intelligentsia which is educated, highly intellectual, 
scientific, and creative. We have definite and noble aims: the 
creation of a decent standard of living for the Belarusian 
people, the striving to lead the Republic to well-being and 
flourishing. To realize these aims, the government will be 
resolute and uncompromising. Thank you.

after an explosion damaged one of the supports of the power line 
feeding the station with electricity. 
  Police have found the remains of the explosive which have 
been sent for examination. This proves preliminary conclusions 
of the investigating commission that the action had been planned 
in advance. Police are still questioning local residents. The 
power line security has been tightened. 
  The explosion occurred on the day when Russian and Latvian

<F P=106> ["Ukraine's Supreme Council Decree on the Status of the </F>
Crimean Autonomous Republic in Accordance With Ukraine's Current 
Constitution and Legislation" issued in Kiev on 24 Feb] 
  [Text] In view of the fact that the Crimean Republic's 
state power structures have recently been adopting numerous 
normative acts and officials have been making statements that go 
beyond the status of the Crimean Republic and which may lead to 
an exacerbation of the situation both in the Crimea and in 
Ukraine as a whole, Ukraine's Supreme Council, proceeding from 
Article 97, Item 19 of the Ukrainian Constitution, resolves as 
follows: 
  1. To advise that, in accordance with Ukraine's Constitution 
and current legislation, 
  a. The Crimean Republic is an autonomous constituent part of 
Ukraine and has extensive rights in the sphere of economics, the 
utilization of natural resources, ecology, culture, the 
organization of social life, and so on. However, the Crimean 
Republic, as an autonomous constituent part of Ukraine, has no 
state sovereignty and cannot establish political relations with 
foreign states; 
  b. Ukraine's Constitution is effective on the entire 
territory of Ukraine, including the territory of the Crimea, and 
the Crimean Republic's Constitution cannot contradict the 
Ukrainian Constitution; 
  c. In accordance with Article 70 of the Ukrainian 
Constitution, the territory of Ukraine, including the territory 
of the Crimea, is unitary, indivisible, inviolable, and 
integral. Any changes to Ukraine's territory or state borders 
without the consent of the Ukrainian people are inadmissible. 
At the same time, as is envisaged in the legislation on the 
status of the Crimean Republic, Ukraine has no right to make 
decisions on changing the territory of the Crimean Republic 
without that republic's consent; 
  d. The Crimean Republic has no citizenship of its own, 
separate from Ukraine. Citizens of Ukraine who permanently 
reside in the Crimea are citizens of the Crimean Republic. The 
Crimea cannot have its own military formations or its own 
monetary or financial systems separate from Ukraine. 
  That is why, in accordance with Ukrainian legislation, the 
supreme bodies of the Crimean Republic's power cannot resolve 
these or other questions that are under the exclusive 
jurisdiction of Ukraine's authorities. 
  2. All bodies of state power of Ukraine and of the Crimean 
Republic, as well as their officials must be guided in their 
activity by Ukraine's Constitution and laws and also by this 
present decree. 
  3. The Supreme Council of the Crimean Republic must, within 
one month, bring the Constitution and other legislative acts of 
the Crimean Republic into conformity with Ukraine's Constitution 
and legislation. 
  4. The president of Ukraine must ensure the fulfillment of 
Ukraine's law "On the Ukrainian Presidential Representation in 
the Crimean Republic." 
  5. The president of Ukraine and Ukraine's Procurator General 
must react in time to violations of the Ukrainian Constitution 
and laws. 
  [Signed] Chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council I. Plyushch 
  [Issued] Kiev, 24 February 1994

  [Text] Moscow will not cause a sensation due to the arrest, 
by the Federal Counterintelligence Service, of a Russian citizen 
working for the British special services, a high-ranking Russian 
diplomat specializing in Russian-British relations told Interfax. 
  He said the arrest of the spy must not hamper the 
partnership 
between Moscow and London. "Contrary to Americans, who are 
fretting due to the Ames case we do not make a tragedy of what 
has happened. The British special service is collecting material 
on Russia, it is natural. It is not natural to take the stand 
of "offended innocence" as the U.S. did in the Ames case," the 
diplomat stressed. 
  He emphasized that intelligence and counterintelligence were 
inalienable parts of any state. They have existed and will 
exist as long as the state itself exists. At the same time, 
there must be civilized ways to react to the arrest of a spy 
working for the other state. This reaction, in fact, tests the 
true character of the bilateral relations, the diplomat said.

<F P=106> [Rail Mustafin article: "Ames Affair: Moscow Takes </F>
Reciprocal Step"] 
  [Text] As we assumed it would, Moscow has taken a 
reciprocal step in the Ames affair. The decision of the Russian 
leadership to declare James Morris, counsellor at the U.S. 
Embassy in Moscow, persona non grata, became known Monday 
evening. The U.S. CIA resident, who was working under 
diplomatic cover, was instructed to leave Russia within seven 
days. Let us recall that Aleksandr Lysenko, the 56-year old 
Russian Foreign Intelligence Service representative who was 
expelled from the United States, received exactly the same 
"term." Thus, the sides kind of traded blows and exchanged 
figures on the board where the invisible dispute between the 
intelligence services is being conducted. 
  According to our experts, Lysenko's expulsion testifies to 
the weakness of the accusation against the Ameses, who are being 
accused of espionage for Moscow's benefit, and the insufficiency 
and obvious weakness of the evidence against them. First of 
all, Lysenko, who only arrived in the United States in July of 
last year, would not have been able, even if he had wanted to, 
to "blow his cover" in contacts with Aldrich Ames so quickly. 
If such contacts really existed. 
  In that case, our intelligence agents who ran the Ameses 
should be expelled. But at the moment they are not being 
touched. Obviously, the Americans have either been unable to 
establish their contacts, or, what is more likely, there were no 
such contacts at all. This version is also corroborated by the 
fact that Lysenko, in accordance with a previously reached 
agreement between the Russian and U.S. intelligence services, 
was known to CIA staffers. Just as Morris was known to the 
Foreign Intelligence Service. This was done for the purposes of 
better cooperation between the two intelligence services in 
spheres like the struggle against drugs trafficking and the 
monitoring of the nonproliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction. But, by expelling Lysenko, the Americans have 
violated the gentlemen's agreement on not divulging the 
department to which the employees of their special services 
belong. 
  Second, even the U.S. press is talking about the 
insufficiency and obvious weakness of the accusation against the 
Ameses. Evidently, in order to somehow compensate for this 
failing, a sensation is deliberately being whipped up in the 
United States over the Ames' arrest. Since there is little 
evidence, all kinds of rumors are being circulated. For 
example, Ames is already being accused of cooperating with the 
drug mafia. (As we know, Aldrich Ames recently worked in the 
department for the struggle against drug trafficking). Neil 
Gerardo, president of the U.S. corporation "Gerardo 
International," which is involved in the development of secret 
weapons systems to Pentagon orders, even claims that Ames could 
have passed secrets to Moscow about the production of the 
company's latest invention -- the so called MRX defense 
technology. According to experts, all this is rank 
disinformation, circulated with only one aim -- to create the 
impression of the monstrous guilt of the Ameses despite 
obviously insufficient evidence. 
  As has become known, the decision on Lysenko's expulsion was 
adopted after two high-ranking CIA representatives visited 
Moscow last week. According to our experts' assessments, they 
rank third and fifth respectively in this organization's 
intelligence hierarchy. The purpose of their visit to Moscow 
was to attempt to persuade our intelligence agents (Foreign 
Intelligence Service Director Yevgeniy Primakov was in Slovakia 
at that time) to take the blame upon themselves and recall 
Aleksandr Lysenko nicely, as well as give up any countermeasures 
or comments in the press. 
  Comments really did appear in the press, and our 
intelligence 
officers could not assume responsibility and kind of admit their 
guilt by agreeing to Lysenko's recall. And they particularly 
could not fail to respond adequately to the expulsion of our 
intelligence officer. 
  The desire to move the affair of exposing someone's agent 
from a generally speaking routine level in the intelligence 
world onto a political level, onto the level of Russian-U.S. 
relations, and the desire to create a pause in relations between 
our countries, is obvious. This is confirmed by relevant 
articles in the U.S. press. In particular, statements about the 
reawakened Russian bear, and about some intrigues or other on 
Russia's part, apparently undermining the United States' 
national security, have been appearing. These are sometimes 
being presented in a way suggesting that the U.S, tax payer is 
virtually financing Russian spies. At the same time, the 
impression is created that behind all the Americans' demands, 
there lies the naive certainty that only they have the right to 
conduct intelligence activities, while Russia no longer has this 
right.

  [Text] Kiev March 3 TASS -- Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk flew to the U.S. for an official visit today. A 
programme of the visit includes his meetings with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton and Vice President Albert Gore. Kravchuk will also 
meet senior officials of the House of Representatives and the 
Senate, representatives of the Administration and the U.S. 
Congress, heads of the corporation for foreign private 
investments and the Chamber of Commerce. Ukrainian-American 
talks will also be held in the Pentagon. 
  A number of important Ukrainian-American documents are 
expected to be signed during the visit, primarily a treaty on

<F P=106> [Report by Lyudmila Yermakova on interview with Federation </F>
Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko; place and date not given: 
"Vladimir Shumeyko: The Legislative Foundation of the Reforms 
Must Be Strengthened"] 
  [Text] The third session of the Federation Council, which 
lasted three days, demonstrated that the "questions raised in 
the chamber are very serious, stemming from the state's main 
preoccupations at the moment, showing what important times we 
live in and how the upper chamber can strengthen the reforms 
with laws," Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko said 
in an exclusive interview for your ITAR-TASS correspondent. The 
speaker described the "absence of factionalism and party 
divisions in the chamber" as one of the reasons for the 
deputies' rapid and efficient work. "We don't care where the 
proposal comes from, as long as it is practical," he explained. 
  Vladimir Shumeyko announced that the president's message to 
the Federal Assembly will be examined at the next plenary 
session, which opens on 15 March. But the deputies have already 
discussed certain problems that directly relate to or develop 
the appeal. Boris Yeltsin said that the time has come for the 
government and legislators to determine the priorities in the 
state, the chamber head pointed out. He regards the fight 
against crime as one of these priorities. The deputies adopted 
a decree on measures to strengthen the fight against crime in 
the Russian Federation. Having said that the strengthening of 
law and order is one of the main means of strengthening the 
Russian state, that is precisely what the president's message is 
called, Vladimir Shumeyko stressed. 
  The deputies agreed that the establishment of order in the 
country is more important at the moment even than economic 
reform. They based their thinking on the fact that this 
"comprehensive and all-embracing problem starts with the 
question of power." The parliamentarian believes that it is 
necessary above all to create a strong vertical power system, 
from top to bottom, so that adopted decisions can be monitored 
and everyone can be compelled to implement them. 
  The state is obliged to ensure the implementation of the 
imperative constitutional demand -- protection of human rights, 
above all the right to life, Vladimir Shumeyko believes. 
According to him, the fight against crime also involves 
question of economic reform. In the transitional period, when 
the old has been destroyed but the new has not yet been created, 
one must be very careful to ensure that certain legal norms do 
not become the object of expansion of criminal activity. 
  The problem of borders comes into this category, the speaker 
said. It is the Federation Council's job to tackle it. 
Undetermined borders enable every Tom, Dick, and Harry to enter 
the territory of the Russian Federation, carrying all manner of 
things -- weapons, drugs. The question of introducing a state 
of emergency is also the upper chamber's prerogative, its head 
pointed out. A great many weapons have accumulated in trouble 
spots, which also leads to an increase in crime. Vladimir 
Shumeyko does not rule out the possibility that as a result of 
parliamentary hearings on measures to strengthen the fight 
against crime the chamber will suggest to the president that he 
introduce states of emergency in some areas of Russia in order 
to be able to seize the weapons that have accumulated there. 
  Concerning the chamber's forms of work, Vladimir Shumeyko 
noted that its work should be strengthened via the committees. 
Following the repairs to the Federation Council building the 
committees now have conditions for more vigorous and successful 
activity, he believes. In the two weeks that remain before the 
next session committees are instructed, in particular, to 
examine and discuss the plan for drafting laws. The committees 
will do this in accordance with the president's message, which 
is on the agenda for discussion at the fourth plenary session of 
the Federation Council. Vladimir Shumeyko stressed that 
parliamentarians must not only express their views on the 
message, but also weave its provisions into their work plans. 
He stressed that Boris Yeltsin's message "can be regarded as 
the first program we have had since 1991 for the development of 
a great state." The laws designed to develop and strengthen 
this program "must be of that standard," the Federation Council 
chairman concluded.

the president. The president reaffirmed his intention to sign

  [Text] According to the latest figures released by the 
Central Electoral Commission of the Republic of Moldova, after 
computing the votes cast in 82 percent of the polling stations, 
the Agrarian Democratic Party is heading the list with 43.27 
percent, followed by [the Bloc of the Socialist Party and] the 
Edinstvo Unity Movement with 21.71 percent, the Bloc of Peasants

  According to our Chisinau correspondent, Cristian Nita, in 
an 
interview granted [yesterday] to THE WASHINGTON POST, Moldovan 
President Mircea Snegur said that the Agrarian Democratic Party 
is a center political party and its election victory will not 
alter the political orientation of the Republic of Moldova.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 42 (532)] </F>
  [Text] President Mircea Snegur is satisfied by the 
preliminary results of the parliamentary elections held Sunday 
in Moldova. He told reporters that with the coming to power of 
the Agrarian-Democratic Party which won a convincing victory, 
there is no ground to believe that Moldova's political course 
will change. As to the success of the Socialist Party and the 
"Unity" Movement which were second at the elections, the 
president said that candidates to parliament from the party, 
will be able to join the Agrarian Party and conduct the course 
of reforms. INTERFAX Note: As of Wednesday morning, 
preliminary results of the elections indicate that the 
Agrarian-Democratic Party has won 43.7% of votes, the 
Socialist 
Party and the Movement "For Equality and Unity"--22% and 
election alliance of peasants and intellectuals--less than 
9%, 
the Christian-Democratic People's Front--7.35%. This means 
that Agrarian Democratic Party will receive approximately 55 
deputy mandates out of 104 and will be able to form the 
government by itself, without resorting to creating a coalition 
body of executive power. Snegur hopes that the new parliament 
will be able to solve the problem of Transdniestria. He 
believes that the proposal of the CSCE standing mission which 
grants Russia the role of a mediator is the basis for settlement 
of the conflict in the region. 
  Snegur said that he means the democratic Russia. If 
nationalist forces come to power in the Russian Federation, 
Moldova will be able to defend itself by resorting to help of 
international organizations, of which it is a member. 
  The president has favored the unconditional withdrawal of 
the 
14th Russian army and said that it is the army of a foreign 
state and must be withdrawn from the territory of the 
independent republic of Moldova. 
  Snegur called the sociological poll scheduled for March 6, a 
political event of primary importance for the strengthening of 
the independence and statehood of Moldova. (On that day the 
citizens of the republic will be asked to answer the question on 
the prospects of the further development of the republic and the 
state's policies -- "INTERFAX"). 
  Speaking Tuesday with the leaders of the commissions 
responsible for the poll in provinces, the president said that 
it was time for the president to address the nation, the most 
consistent judge which can distinguish between the right and the 
wrong. He believes the parliamentary elections on February 27 
showed convincingly that the people can make the right choice. 
  The president believes the forthcoming sociological poll 
will 
positively influence the strengthening of statehood and 
independence of Moldova and its results will tell on the 
adoption by parliament of a new Constitution. 
  Snegur also said that for explanatory activities, about 100 
representatives of the government will go to the republic's 
provinces. Snegur said that 310 thousand Moldovan lei, 
approximately $80,000 will be set aside from the budget for 
conducting the poll.

  [Text] Comrat, BASAPRESS 1/3/1994 -- From our 
correspondent: The victory of leftist forces in elections for 
the Moldovan parliament was determined by the chaos and 
uncertainty reigning in the society, stated to BASAPRESS 
Constantin Tausangi, leader of the Gagauz People's Party (PPG). 
Being aware of the real danger threatening the democratic 
freedoms, PPG is forced to become an underground, illegal party, 
declared Tausangi. According to him, having the majority in 
parliament, the Democratic Agrarian Party and the socialists 
will have no more reasons to say they have not enough power to 
improve the situation and blame the opposition for all failures. 
"We regret much that the socialists are frankly supporting the 
anti-people regime of Topal-Kendighelean", Tausangi asserted.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS 1/3/1994 -- Chisinau governors 
decided to forgive Gagauz leaders all sins in exchange for their 
support in elections for Agrarians, writes today the weekly 
OBSERVATORUL DE CHISINAU (Chisinau Observer), giving a list of 
declarations made by Gagauz People's Party (PPG) leader 
Constantin Tausangi at a press conference before the elections. 
Tausangi qualifies the Wednesday Sangheli-Topal meeting as "a 
useless union between Chisinau and Comrat authorities because 
the south population would anyway participate in the elections." 
PPG leader confessed that he appealed before to Lucinschi and 
Sangheli asking to organize a meeting of all-level deputies at 
which Topal's and Kendighelean's dismissal could he possible. 
"The deputies desire this for a long time but they were not 
able to act because of the dictatorship of Comrat authorities," 
said Tausangi. He said that "after Sangheli drank champagne 
with the criminals Topal and Burgudji," Comrat authorities, 
Chisinau governors' enemies, changed their hehaviour and began 
to call on the south population to vote for Agrarian Democratic 
Party of Moldova [PDAM]. There is no doubt about the victory of 
Agrarians and socialists in regions inhabited by Gagauzians, 
where officials and mass-media insistently promote the idea that 
only these formations will oppose the unification with Romania, 
states the article.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS 1/3/1994 -- The result of 27 
February elections is not a surprise, since democratic forces 
are so much divided, told BASAPRESS Vlad Darie, responsible for 
the electoral campaign of the Moldovan Democratic Party of 
Labour [PDMM]. He estimates that the about 30 deputies of the 
Bloc of the Socialist Party and Edinstvo Unity Movement 
represent interests of another state. Darie thinks that results 
of the voting have been influenced by the anticipate voting of 
the Transdniestrian people and by the opening of additional 
voting sections, against terms provided by law, in regions 
mostly inhabited with Gagauzians. "Now impertinence will be 
ruling. Serious strikes will first of all be applied to the 
Ministry of Education, especially concerning the teaching of 
history and Romanian language," said Darie.

<F P=106> [Cristian Nita report from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] The president of the Republic of Moldova, Mr. 
Mircea Snegur, today received Mrs. (?Josette Girieux), French 
senator, member of the Council of Europe, and observer at the 27 
February elections. As the rapporteur of the Council of Europe 
regarding Moldova's adherence to this body, Mrs. Girieux said 
that the elections were a serious test that was successfully 
passed. She emphasized the fact that the coming, similarly 
important stage is the adoption of the Constitution of the 
Republic of Moldova. 
  German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has sent a letter to the 
president of the Republic of Moldova wherein he expressed 
thanks, among other things, for the message in which President 
Snegur pronounced himself for intensifying cooperation between 
the Republic of Moldova and NATO countries. 
  The letter also emphasizes that the summit meeting in 
Brussels marked a beginning of cooperation with a view to 
establishing order and security on the continent by inviting the 
young democracies in Central and Eastern Europe, and the 
republics of the former USSR to expand political and military 
cooperation with the NATO bloc within the Partnership for Peace 
program. 
  The press service of the president and government of the 
self-proclaimed Dniester Republic has published a declaration 
which, according to BASAPRESS, emphasizes that the Tiraspol 
authorities assess the victory in the elections by the Agrarian 
Democratic Party and the Bloc of the Socialist Party and 
Edinstvo Movement positively by also stressing that the victory 
of the agrarians in the elections will positively influence the 
process of negotiations on the Dniester problem. 
  BASAPRESS also reports that, through a decree issued by Igor 
Smirnov, president of the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic, the 
state of emergency in the Dniester region has been prolonged for 
a further month. It was to be suspended on 1 March.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 1/3/1994 -- The fact that after 
five years since the adoption of Romanian as state language and 
after three years since the victory of independence in Moldova, 
one returns to the idea of Moldovanism is nothing but a 
diversion, declared yesterday to BASA the writer Adrian 
Paunescu, Romanian senator, who is on a visit in Chisinau. "I 
cannot realize how individuals that were called restorers of the 
historical rights of Romanians in Bessarabia, now doubt this 
right, saying we are two peoples, we have two languages, we 
should have two hymns, two flags." According to the senator, 
reasons for such a state of things should be sought, as 
"something happened" in the meantime. "We should not haste and 
attack these people until we find the reasons, and if there is 
nothing more to do after that, we must finally accept relations 
of adversaries," the interviewed adds. In his opinion, Snegur 
risks to remain in history as he was the last time, "without 
hopes for the Romanian people and for his biography." "To a 
certain extent, I am ready to understand him, but I cannot 
accept him pulling out my eye and saying he wishes me good, 
placing instead another taken from a Moscow pharmacy," asserted 
Paunescu, mentioning that "Snegur will be sentenced to become 
Romanian post-mortem."

  [Text] [Unidentified announcer] Radovan Karadzic, president 
of the Serb Republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina held a news 
conference at the Russian Foreign Ministry press center today. 
The news conference concludes his visit to Moscow. Here are 
some details from our correspondent Aleksey Sokolov: 
  [Sokolov] The Bosnian Serb leader recalled at the start of 
the news conference the dramatic events that had been taking 
place in Bosnia-Herzegovina over the past few weeks. As a 
result of these events, Russia found itself at the center of 
efforts to settle the conflict. 
  The Bosnian Serbs, said Karadzic, did not accept the NATO 
ultimatum. However, it was with satisfaction that they received 
a message from Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  Currently, 50 percent of heavy weapons have been withdrawn 
from Sarajevo. The remainder is under the control of UN forces. 
Karadzic expressed the hope that this would lead to talks that 
should result in a peaceful settlement in Bosnia. 
  Karadzic said he had received the invitation to come to 
Moscow with joy. He highly praised his meetings and talks with 
Kozyrev, Churkin, Lukin, Rybkin, and Shumeyko. 
  The role of Russia in establishing the peace in the Balkans 
is exceptionally great, said the leader of the Bosnian Serbs 
again. 
  [Unidentified announcer] Tell us please, were any 
interesting 
figures, or facts to do with the situation referred to during 
the news conference? 
  [Sokolov] In my view, the answer is yes. Karadzic said that 
historically Serbs in Bosnia owned 64 percent of the territory. 
Now they controlled 72 percent -- that is to say only eight 
percent of the land in their hands belongs to others. 
  Moreover, Bosnian Serbs are ready to return these 
territories 
for the sake of peace. Karadzic spoke of possible concessions 
and of the need to examine various ways in which territories 
could be swapped. He agreed that Muslims ought to have a way 
out from their part of Sarajevo toward their own lands. The 
disintegration of Yugoslavia was a sad event, said Karadzic. 
However, since this is the case, it is necessary to establish 
new borders and strive for an internationally recognized treaty, 
which would lead to stability in the region. 
  The Bosnian Serb leader stressed he would like NATO and the 
United States to see his people in a more objective light. NATO 
and the United States, he said, occupied an anti-Serb position. 
  Replying to a question from a correspondent concerning the 
content of his conversation with Zhirinovskiy during yesterday's 
Spartak-Barcelona soccer match, the Bosnian Serb leader said: 
Football. That is all.

Yuriy Malinov and Dmitriy Chubarov] 
  [Text] Moscow March 3 TASS--"We welcome President Boris 
Yeltsin's initiative to hold a summit meeting of the leaders of 
five great powers in Moscow to discuss the settlement in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina," Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Thursday, 
Karadzic 
said that such a meeting involving the presidents of Russia, the 
United States, France, Britain and Germany should be well 
prepared and put an end to the war in Bosnia not only through 
reaching an accord between the warring factions but also through 
signing an international treaty. "When new borders are set, we 
might need the guarantees of five great powers. We would 
welcome such international treaty," Karadzic said. 
  Speaking about the role of the Russian peace-keeping 
contingent in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Karadzic said "We do not 
expect that Russian `blue helmets' will support only the Serbs. 
It will be enough if they take an objective stand and will be 
able to defend our people." 
  He said he wanted the Russian contingent to be bigger. There 
are fears that NATO countries may overstep the competence of the 
U.N. mandate and start acting within the framework of the 
military organisation of the North Atlantic Alliance. Russian 
soldiers will be always following the tasks set by the U.N. and 
will never overstep their mandate, Karadzic stressed. 
  He described the disintegration of Yugoslavia as a tragic 
event which had been long sought by Germany. Now that this has 
happened, it is necessary to set new borders and reach a 
settlement which would lead to durable peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Karadzic said Bosnian Serbs own 64 per cent of the territory 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina but whey control 72 per cent. He said the 
Serbs are ready to hand over these eight per cent to the 
rightful owner. He said they are ready to go even below the 
point of 64 per cent and swap territories for the sake of peace 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  After the news conference, Karadzic left Moscow. 
  Meanwhile, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic called on 
Bosnian Serbs to join the Croatian-Moslem talks on the 
establishment of Bosnian federation. 
  The announcement was made after his talks with French 
Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe. Granic said Croatia shares France's 
position calling for reaching a peace agreement between all 
three warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He noted that the 
Croatian side offers Bosnian Serbs to join the new federation on 
the same terms as the two other concerned sides, and expressed 
the hope that the Serbs will take part in the talks on this 
issue. 
  He stressed that Zagreb stands for normalising relations 
with 
Belgrade. But this can become possible only if Serbs leave the 
territory they are holding in Croatia as envisaged by the 
Washington agreements.

  [Text] Moscow March 3 TASS -- Unless the warring factions 
are not flatly opposed to Russia's participation in overseeing 
the delivery of international humanitarian aid to the Tuzla 
Airport, Russia will take part alongside other states, according 
to Yuriy Vorobyev, Russian first deputy minister for civil 
defence and emergencies. 
  In today's interview with TASS after a meeting with Miles 
dick, first secretary of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, Vorobyev 
said "the Ministry for Emergencies is ready to send its 
representatives to the Balkans and to get down to work already 
tomorrow". 
  A group of Russian representatives is expected to consist of 
about 50 emergency and customs officials, TASS learned from 
well- informed sources. However, before humanitarian supplies 
can be delivered to Tuzla, it is necessary to make necessary 
arrangements at the airport, including repair of the runway. At 
the moment, the airport is not ready for accepting planes. With 
this in view, two ministry officials have left for Belgrade and 
Zagreb to do firsthand assessment of the situation and to agree 
with the U.N. mission a date when the proposed operation could 
be launched, as well as the scope of resources required for it. 
It is quite possible that a Russian plane loaded with 
international humanitarian supplies will be one of the first to 
land at the Tuzla Airport. Some 23 tons of babyfood have been 
already prepared for shipping to the Balkans. 
  The U.S. diplomat described the opening of the Tuzla Airport 
as one of the most pressing tasks, since this is to provide 
those affected by the armed conflict with humanitarian aid. The 
embassy secretary highly praised the activities of the Russian 
Emergencies Ministry's units in former Yugoslavia. "They really 
know their job", he noted. 
  At present, two transport units numbering 90 officials of 
the 
Russian Ministry for Emergencies are operating in former 
Yugoslavia, who ensure the delivery of U.N. humanitarian 
supplies from Belgrade to regions of bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Moscow March 4 TASS -- Russia is ready to send 300 
paratroopers to reinforce its peace-keepers in Bosnia. They 
will be airlifted there as soon as the corresponding decision is 
adopted by the country's top authorities, a source in the 
Russian paratroopers' headquarters told ITAR-TASS on Friday. 
  The source added that Russian paratroopers had been 
surprised 
by a statement of French General Jean Cot that only American, 
British or French servicemen are capable to operate rapidly and 
professionally in Bosnia. 
  He reminded that a very high training level had been 
demostrated by Russian paratroopers during their last month rush 
from Croatia to Bosnia to guarantee the withdrawal of the Serb 
big guns. The operation was a success despite limited time and 
extreme weather conditions. 
  "It is a pity that the French general failed to notice this 
though he could watch Russian paratroopers in action with his 
own eyes", the source said.

  [Text] New York, 4 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- The authoritative 
U.S. newspaper the NEW YORK TIMES today presented its readers 
with what it sees as a new diplomatic surprise by Moscow. It 
alleged that Russia has dropped its objections to the French 
draft of a UN Security Council resolution on a settlement of the 
situation around Sarajevo. The newspaper claimed that Russia 
was threatening to use its right of veto when the draft comes to 
a vote. But after France sent a high-ranking envoy to Moscow, 
Russia agreed to support this resolution with minor changes. 
Voting on the issue is due to take place at the United Nations 
on Friday. 
  Moscow, 4 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- "Things are not quite like 
that," a Russian Foreign Ministry senior official said when 
asked by ITAR- TASS to comment on the U.S. newspaper report. 
"First, we have never been against the resolution, as such. We 
favor a settlement of the situation around Sarajevo and regard 
it as one of the priority areas in the general process of moving 
toward peace in Bosnia. When the French were here on Wednesday 
evening, we managed to agree almost everything with them. 
However, in the light of yesterday's events in New York the 
situation has changed somewhat. So, at the present time, work 
on the text is continuing."

  [Text] New York, 3 Mar -- When, the other day, on the 
heights surrounding the Bosnian capital, the guns at first fell 
silent and were later moved away -- which was achieved with the 
diplomatic participation of Russia -- there was a two-fold 
reaction in the United States. The U.S. Administration, with 
restraint but unequivocally, commended this turn of events; but 
among observers there were those who detected the "machinations 
of Moscow" and a "Russian-Serbian plot" in what was quite 
obviously a humane decision. 
  History also repeats itself as regards lifting the siege of 
Tuzla airport, Which opens up the possibility of dropping food, 
medicines, and other aid to the population. According to 
information received, the first such drop will be made by 
Russia, but some people in the United States do not like the 
fact that this knot is also being untied, primarily with the 
participation of Russia, which is incidentally, acting strictly 
in keeping with UN resolutions, and is sending its observers to 
Tuzla as part of the UN's Blue Helmets. 
  The `NEW YORK TIMES', for example, writes that Russia "is 
offering its troops in order to enable the Serbs to save face, 
confronted as they are with UN demands," and argues about the 
hand extended to the Serbs by Russia. Once again Moscow is 
amply criticized for catching the West unawares by devising a 
formula acceptable to the Bosnian Serbs -- as though the search 
for such a formula, opening up the way to humanitarian aid, were 
not a task that everyone is tackling. 
  One can even hear voices claiming that Russia is, for the 
second time, depriving NATO of an opportunity to launch air 
strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, in fulfilment of the declared 
ultimatum, where UN resolutions are not complied with. One has 
the impression that these resolutions were prompted not by a 
concern for people, be they Muslims, Croats, or Serbs, not by a 
desire for peace and the resolution of an extremely complicated 
Balkan problem, but by a wish to be sure of "punishing" the 
Serbs. 
  Both the guns being moved away from Sarajevo and the dawning 
opportunity to provide humanitarian aid to the population of 
Tuzla are substantial political steps. By accomplishing 
priority tasks, they are at the same time laying down approaches 
to more broadly based tasks -- identifying mutual understanding 
between the sides, establishing cooperation between them, and 
ultimately settling the chronic Bosnian problem. 
  In my opinion, the prime rating in terms of importance goes 
to the fact that these steps have become possible. What 
specific country is making the effort to see that they are 
implemented is a secondary matter. If a different view is 
taken, one may cast doubt on the treaty between the Bosnian 
Muslims and the Bosnian Croats -- even without knowing what it 
contains -- just because it was signed in Washington after 
active mediation by the United States and by Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher personally. 
  In fact, not everyone in the United States welcomed it with 
open arms. Brent Scowcroft, the former national security 
adviser to the President, and now the director of the 
international policy forum, said that the whole value of the 
treaty lay merely in the fact that it "allows the diplomats to 
claim a success." 
  Needless to say, the effectiveness of the document, as with 
any other, must be judged by the results it produces. But the 
actual signing ceremony is a starting point and hence an 
important step. So, Secretary of State Warren Christopher made a 
fitting comment when he said: "This treaty shows how much can be 
achieved, even after bitter years of violence, when two sides 
sit down together at the negotiating table.... It shows that 
peace is possible." 
  Yes, it is possible if one thinks about peace rather than 
about "punishing" the Serbs.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy article: "U.S.-Russian Duet or </F>
International Choir?"] 
  [Text] Commenting on the efforts by the world's two 
leading powers to settle the Bosnian crisis, the U.S. newspaper 
THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER talked of a "duet" between the United 
States and Russia. It is obvious, however, that our countries 
can act, rather, as catalysts of the peacemaking process, whose 
success is unlikely without cooperation with all the other 
interested states. It is no coincidence that President Boris 
Yeltsin has proposed holding a meeting of major heads of state 
devoted to the prospects for resolving the conflict in Bosnia. 
At the same time, as the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
has explained, the composition of the summit need not be limited 
to the five countries named by the president. 
  Nor should it be forgotten that an extremely great deal 
depends on the good will of those actually involved in the civil 
war and on sincere moves by them to end the bloodshed. The 
stand taken by the official leadership of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
[B-H] in recent days is reassuring in this sphere. B-H Prime 
Minister Silajdzic declared in Washington, after signing the 
agreement setting up a Croatian-Muslim federation, that he 
intends to come to Russia in the very near future. In Moscow he 
intends to discuss the prospects for implementing the new plans 
for the B-H state structure and options for cooperation with the 
republic's Serb population in this process. Without Russia, the 
premier admitted, a Bosnian settlement is impossible. 
  But his viewpoint is certainly not shared by everyone. Some 
leaders of that same Bosnia, and also outside the former 
Yugoslavia (in Turkey, for example), are cautious about Russia's 
participation in lifting the blockade of Tuzla Airport. They 
perceive this almost as a buildup of our country's military 
presence in the Balkans. Although such accusations and fears 
are totally groundless. As Vitaliy Churkin, Russian Federation 
deputy minister of foreign affairs and the Russian president's 
special representative, explained, the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Defense has not even been entrusted with the 
practical fulfillment of the provisions of the agreement on 
opening Tuzla Airport. Representatives of the Ministry for 
Emergencies and civilian specialists are being sent to Bosnia. 
According to Vitaliy Churkin, Russia endeavors not to react to 
sundry accusations, realizing that many statements are made in 
an extreme situation and in a state of psychological shock 
caused by war and combat operations. 
  As for the plans to create a Croatian-Muslim federation and 
the prospects for subsequently forming a confederation with 
Croatia, the Russian Foreign Ministry views them with cautious 
optimism. This optimism is founded on the assessment that this 
agreement, being included in the overall picture of a Yugoslav 
settlement, can produce positive results. But it is cautious 
because there have already been quite a few splendid plans which 
have never reached the stage of implementation (take the 
Vance-Owen plan). The point is that a federation, as reported 
previously, provides for unified control over foreign policy, 
joint leadership of the economy, and also the formation of joint 
armed forces. Troops which are still fighting each other today 
will have to unite. (Incidentally, the "unidentified" aircraft 
which bombed the Muslims and were downed by U.S. aircraft had 
actually taken off from Croatian territory, so Croatian Foreign 
Minister Granic has admitted). In addition, territorial 
demarcation is a stumbling block in the present plans, just as 
in the previous ones. Carrying it out essentially means feeding 
both the wolves and the sheep. But who or what will be the 
"dinner"? For it is obvious that we cannot manage here without 
casualties or, at any rate, compromises.... 
  Not only Russia and the United States have their interests 
in 
the region but also Germany, France, Turkey, Iran, and Saudi 
Arabia. Each country has its own historical and political 
allies, whom they support and whose interests they are prepared 
to champion persistently. So a successful outcome to the 
Bosnian crisis can come about only in the event of harmony 
throughout the international "choir" and not just as a solo part 
for the U.S.-Russian "duet."

  [Text] Moscow, 3 Mar -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher expressed understanding of our concern for the 
plight of 25 million Russians who find themselves stranded 
outside Russia's borders, and we highly appreciate this 
position, Andrey Kozyrev said. Answering a question from an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent today, the Russian foreign minister 
noted that in his recent statement, Christopher spoke of the 
need to use legal ways of encouraging the Latvians to expand 
citizenship and grant voting rights to Russians living in 
Latvia. In the minister's view, this pronouncement sits well 
with President Bill Clinton's intention of speaking up for 
minorities in the Baltic countries, a subject which was also 
discussed at the Moscow summit. 
  Andrey Kozyrev stressed that magnanimity on the part of the 
Baltic authorities could hardly be counted on in this respect, 
any more than threats of force on the part of Russia, something 
which was in vogue until recently. "We are dealing with a 
humanitarian problem -- protection of human rights and ethnic 
minorities, and it needs to be treated as such," Kozyrev said. 
In conclusion, the minister noted with satisfaction that "our 
friends in the West are gradually getting used to this idea, and 
losing their traditional bias towards individual regions".

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Borisenko] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 2 March -- A Russian delegation that is 
in the United States at the invitation of the State Department 
has, along with the American side, signed a memorandum on 
understanding aimed at regulating cooperation in the area of 
organizing electronic and postal communications. 
  "We are implementing contacts with the United States on 
matters relating to the supply of modern equipment to Russia," 
Russian Communications Minister Vladimir Bulgak, who is in the 
United States, said in an interview with an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent. "The situation is complicated by the continuing 
existence of eight Cocom [Coordinating Committee for 
Multilateral Export Controls] restrictions on deliveries of this 
kind of equipment." A paradoxical situation is emerging: 
although Cocom is due to formally go out of existence on 31 
March of this year, the restrictions on trade in modern 
technology that it has introduced will remain in force. 
  "Once again we would like to recall that discrimination in 
trade has," V. Bulgak said, "a negative affect on our relations." 
  On the whole, the minister said, cooperation in the area of 
communications between the two countries is constantly 
expanding. The number of telephone channels through which our 
countries can communicate has grown from 80 to 670. As early as 
1995 there will be 1,500 of them and in two years' time there 
will be 3,000. 
  As regards the development of a communications system in 
Russia, the main aim, in the words of the minister, is to 
attract foreign capital. American capital investments in this 
province have amounted to $40 million over two years, while, 
last year alone, the total amount of Western investment in 
Russia's communications system reached $250 million. The 
question of what was hindering the growth of American 
investments was discussed at a meeting with U.S. Secretary of 
Commerce Ronald Brown. "The main barriers on the road to a 
growth in investments are psychological ones," the Russian 
minister said. "And Cocom still has influence, too." 
  If we take a look at the very near future, V. Bulgak 
continued, then once the appropriate digital communications 
networks are set up, Russians will have access to the 
"information superhighway" -- a high-speed international 
computer communications system. "Here we need to solve the 
so-called `50 by 50 problem,'" V. Bulgak said. "We're talking 
about setting up 50 new telephone stations and the laying of 50 
thousand km of new networks. The project is estimated to take 
10 years and it will cost $40 billion to carry it out."

<F P=106> [Observer Aleksandr Vasilyev article: "Was CIA Spy a KGB </F>
Officer? Maybe Aldrich Ames Did Work for Moscow, but this Has 
Yet To Be Proved. During His Trial He Could Make Use of Rudolf 
Abel's Experience"] 
  [Text] A spy-mania campaign is being launched in the 
United States . This is what a commentator of the old Soviet 
school would have written but, although times have now changed, 
nothing has changed in essence. The arrest of CIA officer 
Aldrich Ames and his wife on suspicion of having contacts with 
the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] is a great coup 
for the FBI. Some of its officers have probably already made 
holes in their jackets for their medals. 
  Until the trial begins, the U.S. Administration is 
completely 
controlling coverage of the case of Ames and his wife, releasing 
information in carefully measured doses and spreading rumors. 
In this way it is trying to form public opinion in the United 
States and other countries, specifically Russia. It is too 
early yet to guess whether it will be possible to influence the 
court's decision through the spy-mania campaign but, as regards 
the Americans, the propaganda machine has already backfired. 
Numerous television and radio talk-in programs are receiving 
calls from bewildered viewers and listeners who ask: Why has 
the White House gone into hysterics if the United States is 
itself engaging in espionage in Russia? As regards our country, 
Russians and most of the press have adopted a patriotic stance. 
As far as I can judge the degree of support has pleasantly 
surprised the FIS. 
  Because of this whole fuss and game of big politics the fate 
of the arrestees themselves has receded into the background. 
Everything concerning them seems to be clear. In actual fact 
nothing is clear. The upcoming trial promises to be long and 
difficult -- difficult for both the prosecution and the defense. 
Because Ames has not admitted his guilt and has refused to 
cooperate with the authorities, and the U.S. legal system and 
good attorneys can turn any ostensibly clear-cut case into a 
whodunit with an unpredictable ending. This can be seen by 
reading material from the trial of Soviet intelligence officer 
and illegal Rudolf Abel, who was arrested in New York in 1957. 
Colonel Abel was facing life imprisonment or the death penalty 
but received 30 years, and having served four years was 
exchanged for U.S. spy pilot Francis Powers, who was shot down 
in the Sverdlovsk area. 
  The intelligence game is full of contradictions. 
Professional intelligence officers are even respected by their 
opponents. In 1957 CIA Director Allen Dulles said: "I would 
like us to have three or four men like Abel in Moscow." But the 
agents an intelligence officer recruits or who are handed over 
to him to handle are his main tool. Agents betray their own 
country and as a rule ordinary people have contempt for them. 
Radio officer Kheykhanen, who gave Abel away to the FBI and who 
was also a Soviet intelligence officer, did not arouse the 
Americans' sympathy, although, objectively speaking, he 
protected U.S. national security. Kim Philby was a hero to the 
Soviet Union but remains a traitor to Britain. Ames is no Abel 
or Philby. He was possibly an agent (unlike Abel) who maybe 
worked for money (unlike Philby). Nevertheless it is in Russia's 
interests for the trial to end in his favor or, if he is found 
guilty and imprisoned, it is a matter of honor to us to support 
Ames and try to get him out of his prison cell. Because all 
current and potential Russian intelligence agents will follow 
the trial very closely. They will decide whether "to work or 
not to work for Russia" depending on the Kremlin's behavior in 
this situation. It should be counted as one of the U.S. 
intelligence services' greatest achievements that some years ago 
the White House succeeded in obtaining an amnesty for KGB 
officer Boris Yuzhin, who had cooperated with the CIA. How they 
contrived to do this is still a mystery. 
  Let us return to Ames. Obviously the defense will devote 
priority attention to prosecution evidence and how it was 
obtained. Ames was not caught in the act of handing over secret 
documents to Russian officers. At the FBI's instigation the 
U.S. press has written that he chalked crosses to give signals 
to the Russians and used dead drops. This is hard to believe 
(see KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA of 25 February 1994 for our arguments) 
but let us suppose. What will his attorneys say? A possible 
line of defense is as follows: Ames recently worked in the CIA 
department which combats drug dealers. He could say that the 
crosses and dead drops were for his agents, members of the drugs 
mafia. Incidentally, his meetings with Russian intelligence 
officers could be explained in the same way. 
  In this sense Abel's position was more difficult. According 
to attorney James Donovan's memoirs "a shortwave radio receiver 
with a schedule for receiving broadcasts, bolts, cuff links, tie 
clips, and other hollowed-out objects serving as `containers,' a 
code pad, encoded texts, a device for making microdots, and 
geographical maps of the United States with main defense areas 
marked on them" were found in his apartment, but the 
representatives of authority did not have an arrest and search 
warrant. They contravened the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution, the essence of which is "my home is my castle." 
Donovan tried to prove that all these ciphers, bolts, and tie 
clips could not be used to prove Abel's guilt, since they had 
been obtained illegally. When Donovan's appeal was heard by the 
U.S. Supreme Court, it was rejected by a margin of only one (!) 
vote. 
  The next question is: Who is a witness? The chief witness 
could be the Russian intelligence officer who gave Ames away. 
But the point is that by no means every officer knows Ames. 
Information about such a high-level agent is concealed even from 
one's own people. The most experienced and the highest-ranking 
intelligence officers work with such people. As far as I know, 
lately there have been no defectors among the aces working 
throughout the United States. There is another possible 
scenario: The person who gave Ames away is still working 
in Russian intelligence. But this means that he will not be 
able to appear as a witness and that he does not have long left 
as a free man: He will be fingered all the same. Incidentally, 
in the opinion of professionals the Americans are very careless 
about looking after their agent network, often jeopardizing it 
for the sake of immediate political advantages. 
  I have formed the impression that we are dealing with the 
second scenario. The FBI is stressing just a little too 
importunately that Ames was not living within his means and that 
he bought, for example, a nice house in the Washington suburbs, 
paying the whole sum in cash. U.S. officials want to make 
everyone believe that Ames was given away by envious neighbors 
and to divert attention away from the real source of information. 
  According to information available to me, Ames' wife, who 
worked with him both in the CIA and for Russian intelligence, is 
cooperating with the investigation. If this is true, attorneys 
will try to discredit her as a witness and prove that she hates 
her husband or is jealous of him, that she wants to get her 
revenge on him, and that her evidence is not credible. The 
trial will get bogged down in an investigation into family 
mutual relations. 
  It is interesting how Donovan tried to make the jury 
disbelieve Kheykhanen's evidence: He was engaged in espionage 
for Soviet Russia, arrived in the United States on a false 
documents, and "is in effect a professional liar." The same 
accusations were made against Abel but it did not matter: What 
mattered was the identity of the witness. The attorney had 
something else to add, stating that Kheykhanen was an alcoholic 
and bigamist. 
  It will now be all the more interesting to follow the 
development of events. "The start of the trial is like a show. 
The curtain goes up and, in ideal conditions, the drama begins 
to unfold, a drama which the judge and jury are seeing for the 
first time. The tale is repeated several times, corroborated, 
confirmed, and refuted. The essence of the case is elicited in 
detail, point by point. First this is done by one side, then by 
the other. Every witness appearing on the stage is a new actor" 
-- this is what was written about Abel's trial by J. Donovan, 
his attorney. 
  In Ames' case the drama could turn into a comedy if his 
guilt 
is not proved successfully. After all, U.S. President Bill 
Clinton himself intervened in the case. What genuine 
indignation was written all over his face when he was talking 
about the perfidious and ungrateful Russians! However, let us 
not forget that sometimes the current U.S. Administration is 
notable for its unprofessionalism.

  [Text] Russia's military and, most importantly, political 
and peacekeeping presence both in the CIS countries and on the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia in itself is not being 
assessed unequivocally. The statement on the situation in the 
Near East, which was distributed today by Russia's Foreign 
Ministry, will probably also arouse various emotions. The tense 
situation on the occupied Palestinian territories connected with 
the crime in Hebron is prompting Russia to take active steps 
towards a peaceful process. Mikhail Timurin, a staff member of 
the Press and Information Department of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, read us the text of the statement over the telephone: 
  [Timurin] A tense situation persists on the occupied 
Palestinian territories. The Foreign Minister of the Russian 
Federation is keeping in constant touch with the Palestinian and 
Israeli leadership. 
  On the personal instruction of the president of the Russian 
Federation, First Deputy Foreign Minister Ivanov has been sent 
to the Near East to meet with Chairman 'Arafat of the 
Palestinian Liberation Organization and also with the leaders of 
Israel. Russia believes it necessary for the UN Security 
Council to adopt an effective resolution with a view to ensuring 
security on the occupied territories. The idea of international 
protection for the civilian population on the occupied 
territories deserves most serious attention. 
  The stalling -- for the umpteenth time now -- of the Near 
East talks shows that a new international impetus is needed for 
the cause of the reconciliation between Arabs and Israelis to 
proceed further. A second plenary meeting of the Madrid 
conference on the Near East at the level of foreign ministers 
could be this impetus.

Nikolay Manvelov and Dmitriy Chubarov] 
  [Text] Moscow March 3 TASS -- Russia considers it necessary 
for the U.N. Security Council to adopt an effective resolution 
in order to ensure security on the Israeli-held territories, 
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mikhail Demurin said. 
  Speaking at a news briefing in Moscow on Thursday, Demurin 
said that the world community should pay attention to the idea 
of international protection of civilians in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip. The alarming situation following the barbaric crime 
committed by an Israeli extremist in Hebron forces Russia to 
take further active steps in order to help overcome the current 
crisis in the endangered peace process. 
  The lack of progress in the Middle East talks shows that 
there is the need to give the process of reconciliation between 
the Arabs and Israelis a new international impetus, Demurin 
said. "The second plenary session of the Madrid conference on 
the Middle East at the foreign minister level could become such 
an impulse. As for the immediate future, Russia stands for the 
continuation of bilateral talks which could be held where it is 
convenient for their participants," the spokesman said.

  [Text] Tel Aviv March 3 TASS -- Russian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Igor Ivanov, who is presently staying in Israel on a 
Mid-East diplomatic mission, said today in a press release: 
"Our visit to Israel, the same as the entire current Mideast 
mission, is carried out by Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 
order. A decision to send a special envoy to the region was 
passed by the president with due reagrd for the sharply 
aggravated situation on the Jordan West Bank and in the Gaza 
Strip, as well as for the threat of peace process disruption. 
Being a great power and co-sponsor of Arab-Israeli talks, 
Russia is fully aware of its special responsibility for their 
further progress. In this connection, our main task is to do 
our utmost to prevent peace process from being disrupted, to 
promote the creation of such an atmosphere, such conditions that 
would prevent any further escalation of violence." 
  The contacts established by us in Tunisia, with Chairman of 
the Palestine Liberation Organization's Executive Committee 
Yasir 'Arafat, and in Tel Aviv, with Israeli leaders Yitzhaq 
Rabin and Shim'on Peres, revealed what we consider the main 
tendency, the deputy foreign minister went on to say. The 
essence of this tendency is that both sides understand quite 
well there is no alternative to peace process. Only through a 
dialogue, constructive and restrained, we will manage to address 
the sensitive issues now facing Palestinians and Israelis, 
Ivanov stressed. 
  During detailed conversations with the Israeli prime 
minister 
and foreign minister, and taking into account our meetings with 
the PLO leader, we tried to find such a solution to the Hebron 
crisis that would enable the confronting sides to return to the 
negotiating table. In the context of these conversations, 
Ivanov said, we also considered the problem of international 
presence on the occupied territories, which is designed to 
become an additional guarantee of safety and stability. 
  The Russian diplomat emphasised that "both Palestinian and 
Israeli leaders highly praised the initiative moves by the 
Russian co-sponsor taken under President Yeltsin's decision and 
aiming to preserve and bolster peace process, pointed to their 
timeliness and spoke in favour of closer contacts in the future."

  [Text] A high-ranking Russian military official told 
Interfax on Wednesday that Russia was to begin the withdrawal of 
strategic missiles from Ukraine at the beginning of March. He 
also said that the first lot consisted of 60 warheads removed 
from the strategic missiles of the 46th missile division and 
43rd missile army. There are about 2,000 nuclear warheads in 
Ukraine. 
  He expressed satisfaction that Moscow and Kiev had found a 
political solution of this problem. He also said that delays in 
the withdrawal of the strategic nuclear weapons were due to the 
unpreparedness of corresponding documents. He believes that 
after the necessary papers are prepared by the Ukrainian customs 
and other agencies, there would be no further delays.

  [Text] Moscow March 3 TASS -- A senior official of the 
Russian Defence Ministry denied press reports that dozens of 
nuclear charges from Ukraine had arrived for dismantling to an 
enterprise in the Urals in Russia. 
  The report "does not correspond to reality and is wishful 
thinking of reporters," General Vitaliy Yakovlev told TASS on 
Thursday commenting on a Wednesday report of the "SEGONYA" daily. 
  "No train with nuclear charges has departed from the 
neighbouring country to Russia so far," he added, but expressed 
hope that Ukraine's nuclear disarmament will begin soon. 
  Ukraine pledged to give up its nuclear weapons under an 
agreement signed with Russia and the United States in Moscow in 
January. 
  According to Yakovlev, there are nearly 2,000 nuclear 
charges 
in Ukraine at present. Their safety level causes great concern 
of experts and delays in their transportation to Russia can 
result in unpredictable consequences, he warned. 
  Russia guarantees to Ukraine safety of all work during 
transportation and scrapping of the nuclear weapons, according 
to the general.

  [Text] Moscow March 3 TASS -- Ukraine promised to pay a 
part of its debt for the Russian fuel before the deadline set by 
Gazprom, the major Russian gas supplier, expires. 
  Rem Vikharev, head of Gazprom, told ITAR-TASS on Thursday 
that he had got a message from Ukraine saying 20 million U.S. 
dollars would be transferred before March 5. 
  "This sum does not represent a complete solution," he said, 
adding that Ukraine should conduct a better search for other 
means to pay. 
  At 10.00 a.m. today, Russia started cutting gas supplies to 
Ukraine by 50 million cubic metres a day, and threatened a 
complete cut-off in three days unless Kiev pays its debts for 
previous deliveries. 
  In the meantime, an official at Ukraine's Embassy in Moscow 
said the effect of Russia decision to cut gas supplies to 
Ukraine should not be over-dramatized. 
  Ranking diplomat Vladimir Fedorov told ITAR-TASS on Thursday 
that for the past twelve months, Ukraine has accumulated "great 
experience in settling payments-for-gas disputes." 
  "Similar situations occured in the past. But Ukraine has 
never been completely deprived of Russian gas," he noted. 
  According to Fedorov Ukraine is searching for ways to pay 
its 
300 billion rouble debt, an estimate which contradicts with the 
Russian Gazprom company's assessments. According to them, 
Ukraine owes Russia not less than 1.5 trillion roubles. 
  Fedorov put forward a simple version explaining the current 
delay of payments. It has been caused by the failure of a deal, 
according to which the Ukrainian debt had to be paid with 14 
fishing boats. Now Kiev is considering other options, including 
swapping consumer goods for the debt, he said. 
  The Ukrainian diplomat stressed that the problem has nothing 
to do with state politics. It is a purely economic question, to 
be setttled by Russian gas producers and Ukrainian consumers, he 
said.

Russian gas for the needs of its own consumers, Yuriy Shafranik, 
Russian minister of fuel and power, told ITAR-TASS in the 
Kremlin on Friday [4 March].

payments for oil since September 1, last year. Only 
pre-September debts remain to be settled," Shafranik said, 
pointing out that a joint scheme is being worked out to enable 
Ukraine to repay debts on time. 
  Touching upon Ukraine's default of payment for gas, the 
Russian minister said "we have to take measures with regard to 
Ukraine just as to any other user. It is a question of 
responsibility between the user and supplier, not an 
exacerbation of inter-state relations."

  [Text] Moscow, March 2 (TASS) -- Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin and visiting Uzbek President Islam Karimov 
met here on Wednesday for intergovernmental talks. The talks 
ended in signing an ample package of Russo-Uzbek documents. 
  The documents include intergovernmental agreements on 
principles of mutual technical and material supply of armed 
forces, on cooperation in air transport, on avoiding double 
taxation. 
  Russian and Uzbek plenipotentiary envoys signed a consular 
convention, a programme for cooperation between the foreign 
ministries for 1994, agreements on cooperation and mutual 
assistance in customs affairs, on cooperation between customs 
offices in seizing and returning illegally exported and imported 
cultural treasures, as well as in customs inspection of 
citizens' personal belongings. 
  When asked questions from journalists after the signing 
ceremony, Chernomyrdin said today's talks had helped resolve 
many problems hampering the development of Russo-Uzbek 
relations. "I am very happy about the talks outcome", he

  [Text] Moscow March 3 TASS -- "Political, civil and 
national stability is the ground on which Uzbekistan is building 
its future," Uzbek President Islam Karimov said today at a 
meeting with representatives of the Russian political and 
business circles, held at the Uzbek embassy in Moscow. 
  He stressed the importance of the documents, signed during 
his visit to Russia, and made special mention of President 
Yeltsin's address to the State Duma. For the first time ever 
"CIS member states were given an answer concerning the 
priorities of Russia's domestic and foreign policy. Russia is a 
great power. We believe in Russia, in its great future. Our 
belief is based on the historic roots, without which our today's 
friendship and cooperation would be impossible," the Uzbek 
president said. 
  "Russia should be a guarantor of peace and stability in 
Central Asia. There will always be two poles in the world, and 
we in Uzbekistan are keeping closer to Russia's pole," he 
stressed.

  [Text] A bilateral meeting of representatives of the 
Russian and Uzbek corps of directors culminated in the signing 
of a treaty on comprehensive cooperation between the Uzbek Union 
of Entrepreneurs and the Russian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs [RUIE]. 
  RUIE President Arkadiy Volskiy: 
  "This document opens up extensive prospects for mutually 
beneficial cooperation. The economic crisis which none of the 
former Union's republics has succeeded in avoiding was largely 
due to the disruption and severing of traditional economic ties. 
Therefore establishing these ties will enable industrial 
enterprises to autonomously resolve any arising problems without 
politicians interfering. All this should undoubtedly help 
stabilize the situation and extricate real manufacturers from 
the protracted crisis most speedily." 
  Kh. Gulyamov, head of the Association of Machine Building 
Enterprises of Uzbekistan: 
  "We have fully felt the breakdown of traditional ties. 
Therefore there is only one correct route today -- to actively 
cooperate with associated plants and create joint enterprises 
oriented to the production of finished output. 
  "We are now actively engaged in this. Several dozen joint 
enterprises have already been set up, or are in the making, with 
enterprises in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. The current 
meeting has enabled us to formulate a mechanism for cooperation. 
  "We have defined certain priority areas for ourselves and 
Russian industrialists. These include developing and setting up 
an agricultural equipment complex in Ukraine, in particular mini 
sugar refineries."

  [Text] Moscow, 2 Mar -- An agreement on cease-fire in the 
zone of the Karabakh conflict has been reached. It was mainly 
maintained since midnight on 1 March. An ITAR-TASS 
correspondent learned about this today from Georgiy Kondratyev, 
the deputy defense minister of Russia, who has returned from 
Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. He believes that this 
agreement is the main result of his working visit to Yerevan, 
the capital of Armenia, and Baku as a head of the Russian 
Defense Ministry commission on the settlement of the Karabakh 
conflict, as well as his meetings with the heads of the states 
and the defense ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>
  [Text] Any agreement on ceasing fire "may remain only on 
paper", as long as the armed units of the warring sides in 
Karabakh are not disengaged. This statement was made in an 
interview with Interfax on Thursday [3 March] by the special 
envoy of the Russian president, Vladimir Kazimirov, who leads 
Russia's mediatory mission for a settlement in Karabakh. On 
Wednesday he returned from a trip to Yerevan and Baku. 
  According to him, his trip was designed to implement a 
protocol signed by the defence ministers of the conflicting 
sides in Moscow on February 18th. The protocol provided for 
ceasing fire, halting military actions and disengaging the 
warring sides for some distance with a view to "consolidating an 
end to the bloodshed". "The principal task was to secure a 
ceasefire at midnight on March 1st. That task was accomplished," 
Kazimirov said. 
  According to him, the only guarantee for the ceasefire can 
be 
to disengage the two sides' armed units for a distance 
insurmountable by artillery fire. "This means that each side 
must retreat and withdraw its heavy weapons about 10 or 15 
kilometers away from the front line. So far this condition has 
not been met, and separate violations of the truce continue," 
Kazimirov said. 
  When the two sides withdraw their forces, 30 mobile groups 
of 
observers comprising Russian servicemen stationed in the area 
will be deployed in "the disengagement strip". Representatives 
of the warring sides will be included in these groups. "This is 
the only way to determine objectively which side is responsible 
for one violation or another, and raise the issue of calling to 
account the direct violators, and possibly their military 
commanders," Kazimirov pointed out. 
  Russia's latest actions in the area were "well coordinated" 
with the efforts of the CSCE Minsk Group, he said. In the 
course of his trip he conferred with the chairman of the Minsk 
Group, Ian Elliason, and stressed "Russia's willingness to 
cooperate". 
  However, the diplomat said, "Russian groups of observers 
will act as pioneers after all." "We are prepared to keep 
Russian groups locally for two days after the disengagement of 
the warring sides. Unfortunately, the CSCE has no such 
opportunity," Kazimirov said.

<F P=106> [Liana Minasyan report under the "Conflict" rubric: "No </F>
Truce in Karabakh Although Protocol on it Is Signed"] 
  [Excerpts] A protocol signed in Moscow by representatives 
of the military agencies of Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and 
Nagorno- Karabakh calls for the creation of a united staff of 
representatives of the four sides, and the deployment of 
mixed-personnel posts in the security zone along the line of 
confrontation. Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian 
deputy defense minister, stated in this regard that the staff 
should be composed of some 250 people with 69 servicemen to be 
contributed from Russia's armed forces. After the cease-fire as 
of 1 March and the start of the withdrawal of troops and heavy 
equipment, the Russian part of the united staff will be 
immediately moved to the conflict area. The move envisions the 
creation of three small zonal staffs so as to enable full 
control over the entire area of military operations. In Georgiy 
Kondratyev's view, the implementation of the Moscow protocol 
will make it possible to pave the way for talks on a political 
settlement. [passage omitted] 
  At any rate, the military situation that has taken shape 
allows for a somewhat greater optimism in hoping for 
reconciliation. During February, Karabakh's armed forces closed 
the gaps in their defense lines formed in the course of the New 
Year Azeri offensive. Azeri formations, too, are with time 
coming to resemble an army more and more, which unavoidably 
happens as combat experience builds up. This equilibrium signals 
the fact that there will be no territorial gains by military 
means. But Aliyev has been left a chance to receive "from the 
hands" of peacekeepers Azeri territories occupied by Karabakh's 
army, waiving the principle of Russian military nonpresence in 
the republic. This question will perhaps be postponed until the 
summit since it would signify a radical change in Azerbaijan's 
policy.

  [Text] Moscow, 3 Mar -- Russia is entitled to station as 
many troops in Kaliningrad Oblast as it needs to maintain 
security and stability, and, it goes without saying, as allowed 
by international commitments. This was stated by Mikhail 
Demurin, deputy director of the Information and Press Department 
of the Russian Foreign Ministry, at a briefing he gave today. 
  During his visit to Latvia on 23 and 24 February this year, 
the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said, President Lech 
Walesa of Poland expressed concern at the allegedly excessive 
concentration of Russian troops in Kaliningrad Oblast. He also 
called for: The removal of this tumor, which, in his view, 
posed a potential threat to security in the region. Such 
statements do not contribute to stability in the Baltic region 
and are clearly not in keeping with the spirit of recent 
Russian-Polish accords, including ones reached at summit level, 
Demurin stressed.

<F P=106> [Valentin Ovsyannikov "Commentary": "Is Alliance With NATO </F>
Affordable?"] 
  [Text] The strategic "Partnership for Peace" program 
approved at the January NATO summit is taking on real outline. 
A number of countries have not taken time out for lengthy 
contemplation of the proposed plan but have hastened to take the 
opportunity. The number of signatories to the framework 
document of the "Partnership" is already approaching 10, 
including Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Estonia, 
Slovakia, and Latvia. The first from the CIS is Ukraine. 
  In their statements at the signing ceremony officials from a 
number of the aforementioned states intimated that they have not 
renounced their long cherished idea of full NATO membership, and 
so the signing of the program is seen as the first step toward 
achieving the coveted aim, which will certainly facilitate 
integration into Western Europe. For instance, Hungary sees 
itself in the first group, and the Czech Republic and Poland 
also aspire to this. Romania is concerned at the prospect of 
ending up in the group of "laggards." 
  In this connection it is timely to recall that the 
alliance's 
partners should not expect dividends alone, as their 
participation entails commitments, including financial ones. 
Material outlay will vary according to the specific content of 
bilateral agreements (joint military exercises, the 
standardization of armaments, the implemenation of scientific 
research, and so on). The state coffers will have to earmark 
around $50 billion for the relevant measures announced by Poland 
in this sphere in 1994, for instance. Obviously, such sums are 
beyond the reach of countries in the East which are not 
experiencing the best of times. This, in turn, will determine 
the pace at which they become involved in the activity of the 
Western bloc. 
  But what kind of peace does the program promise our country? 
The Brussels concept is aimed at developing the partnership 
relations and practical cooperation with all European CSCE 
member states, including in the East of the continent. We 
welcome this approach, and we are prepared to become a 
responsible and keen partner of NATO. Our stance is that the 
transformation of the European security system should be 
approached in a balanced and gradual manner. It is also 
necessary to ensure the openness of regional organizations and 
institutions and to guarantee an equal level of security for all 
European countries without any "differentiation." It is a 
matter of forming a really pan-European security system, of 
joint, collective resistance to any new threats to stability on 
the continent, and of the worldwide strengthening of the 
potential of the CSCE, under whose auspices other European 
structures would also function -- namely, the EU, NATO, NACC 
[North Atlantic Cooperation Council], WEU [Western European 
Union], and CIS. 
  Russia's stance is evaluated positively by Western official 
circles, which believe that security in Europe is impossible 
without or in defiance of Russia. Developing it, the advocates 
of constructive cooperation with Moscow urge that every effort 
be made to attain a strategic partnership with Russia. Nothing 
must be done, they warn, to damage its political stability or 
reinforce the "besieged fortress syndrome" which continues to 
exist in influential military circles. 
  Unfortunately, the Cold War left deep scars on the minds 
and mentality of Western politicians. How else can the 
following comment be explained. For instance, NATO Secretary 
General M. Woerner said in the lobbies at the Brussels summit 
that in order to establish an "honest partnership" with the 
alliance Moscow must continue democratic reforms and renounce 
the idea of expansionism. The "resolute" warnings of Belgian 
Foreign Minister W. Claes are even more perplexing. If Moscow 
continues in the same vein and alarm signals continue to come 
in, he declared, then NATO may accelerate steps aimed at 
integrating the countries which meet the required terms for 
entry into NATO. 
  You get the impression that it is to the advantage of some 
people in the West to remain deaf to all Moscow's arguments 
based on international law. This is the theme which Foreign 
Minister A.V. Kozyrev developed in his article entitled 
"Partnership for a United, Peaceful, and Democratic Europe," 
published in THE WASHINGTON TIMES. In it the leader of the 
Russian foreign policy department shows that Russia's foreign 
policy has already demonstrated that it is geared toward 
achieving national interests through partnership and not 
confrontation with the world. This policy is enshrined by the 
new democratic Constitution. Russia, in his words, has no 
territorial claims against any country in the world, including 
the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Moreover, its new 
military doctrine gears the Armed Forces exclusively toward 
defending Russia and its allies, and also toward participating 
in peacemaking operations in line with international commitments. 
  It is also well known that Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
sent a letter to FRG Chancellor H. Kohl. In it the Russian 
leader gives assurances that he will not heed those who are 
calling for a nationalist or imperialist policy to be 
implemented. 
  The West is now trying a different tack, attempting this 
time 
to cast doubt on Moscow's desire to officially formalize its 
participation in the "Partnership for Peace." According to the 
Western mass media, Moscow is sending out contradictory signals, 
and confused Western leaders cannot fathom whether Russia is 
interested in joining the aforementioned initiative. For 
greater cogency, references are made to alleged differences of 
opinion on this subject within the Russian Federation leadership. 
  A Foreign Ministry representative at a recent briefing 
dispelled doubts about the Kremlin's true intentions and 
confirmed our positive attitude toward the program. He 
explained that the Russian side will soon hold talks with a 
delegation of NATO experts during which it is planned to discuss 
plans for Russia to join the program, to obtain explanations 
from NATO officials, and to propose its own scenarios for 
cooperation. In particular, we will put forward our proposal 
that partnership develop on the basis of the NACC, in which 
neutral states could play a full part. The main forum within 
which key problems of partnership will be thrashed out will be 
meetings between ambassadors and permanent representatives, 
while the practical implementation of its decisions will be 
entrusted to a political-military steering committee subordinate 
to the NACC. 
  In this way the process of elaborating a strategy of 
European 
partnership will develop.

  [Text] Moscow March 4 ITAR-TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin 
has called for the adoption of a memorandum on civil peace in 
Russia to offset the destabilising effect of the week-old 
political amnesty. 
  He was speaking at the extended meeting of the Russian 
Government which opened in the Kremlin on Friday morning. 
  President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin are meeting with ministers, leaders of state 
committees and other federal executive bodies, as well as 
parliament chamber speakers, faction leaders and heads of local 
governments, as well as the leaders of interregional 
associations and public organisations. 
  Ironically, the other item on the agenda of today's meeting, 
eagerly awaited in and outside Russia is road safety.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Boris Yeltsin at an expanded meeting of </F>
the government in the Kremlin -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed participants in this meeting. Eight days 
have passed since the presentation and sending of the 
president's message to the Federal Assembly. Quite a few 
deputies have already voiced agreement with the main provisions 
of the message. The long-awaited outlines of a common approach 
to the resolution of economic problems are becoming clear. I 
intend to do everything possible to strengthen it. This is all 
the more necessary in the present situation, when the danger of 
confrontation has appeared. I refer, first and foremost, to the 
political amnesty. 
  I am fully aware of how contradictory the Duma decision is 
and of how hastily it was implemented. I considered, and still 
do consider, that a violation of the Constitution, the law, and 
moral standards has been committed here. 
  The amnesty decision posed a most acute question for me as 
president: either a new schism, a new round of implacable 
struggle or, despite everything, the preservation and growth of 
a base for interaction, for cooperation in the state and in 
society. 
  For the country, for the benefit of its citizens, for 
security, for civic peace, the first path is ruled out. It can 
only lead to confrontation. 
  The address to the Federal Assembly spoke of the need for 
all 
healthy forces in society and all authorities and political 
forces to cooperate in what is currently the main issue -- the 
strengthening of the state, nor was it said for the sake of 
style and form. 
  Russia now is an altogether different country: it has a 
constitution, it is able to resolve its problems peacefully. I 
think that together we will be up to the task of breaking the 
habit of always struggling and that we will be able to 
neutralize the adverse effects of the amnesty. 
  I am convinced that a majority of our deputies' corps does 
not suffer from political amnesia and that it does understand 
the absolute need to link efforts to surmount the crisis and to 
strengthen the state. 
  There is a platform for consensus -- the presidential 
address. I think the time has come to create firmer guarantees 
of civic peace in the country. The president, the Federation 
Council, the State Duma, the government, the power-wielding 
structures, parties, movements, and public organisations should 
share the responsibility for preserving that peace. 
  The adoption of a memorandum on civic peace in Russia could 
become the first step along this path. Such a memorandum should 
to include not just a declaration of intent, but also mechanisms 
stipulating accountability for decisions that are being adopted. 
The leadership of the State Duma has reacted positively to this 
proposal. 
  I have no doubt that the government will also support it. 
  Today in Russia democracy means first and foremost 
stability, 
order, cooperation. The government is faced with an extremely 
important task. I would like to start with the situation in the 
coal-mining areas. It is inadmissible that wages should not be 
paid for several months. I shall keep an attentive eye on the 
development of events, on the position of the trade unions. 
Naturally urgent decisions will be made, but in the future let 
those first and foremost who are late in paying for the coal, 
who hold up wages bear responsibility. 
  The entire legal mechanism regarding liability for breaches 
of labor legislation needs to start working, beginning right 
from the very bottom. One should not rely solely on the 
government for everything. Judges and the procuracy should at 
last take a more active stand regarding workers' complaints. 
You see what things have come to. The Norilsk city court 
rejected several actions brought for breach of the collective 
contract. Some similar cases have come to light in the Kuzbass, 
too. 
  In the immediate future I intend to submit to the State 
Duma, 
by way of a legislative initiative, a package of amendments to 
the criminal code and to the law on collective contracts. 
Liability for breach of labor legislation needs to be stepped 
up. Let those who fail to honur obligations pay fines. Of 
course the problems cannot be solved by strikes today, but the 
liability of those who condemn the workers to strike must be 
stepped up. That is our common task. 
  The government has to determine the mechanisms to implement 
the strategy for the new stage of the reforms as set out in the 
message and to determine the tactics. It will not be easy to do 
this. This year the situation in the economy remains difficult. 
The sociopolitical conditions are rather tough. There is not 
much freedom of maneuver. 
  The government has a program which was adopted in August 
1993. It must, of course, be refined, but the main thing is that 
it must be fulfilled. What is required of the government today 
is for it to have a long-term policy. Economic reform at any 
price is a mistaken slogan. People could reject a reform which 
is too burdensome. Life has shown that it is not just the 
reform, itself, which entails certain costs. Even greater losses 
are caused by delaying changes which are urgently needed. 
  The main thing today is the energetic transformation of the 
economic mechanism. The government has to continue to take upon 
itself the main burden of the problems. This is a sign of 
weakness of state power. The reform of the economic mechanism 
leaves the state those problems which the market system does not 
cope with. It will become not only strong but also cheap. 
  A qualitatively new stage of privatization is one of the 
main 
reserves of reform. The voucher stage must be completed without 
hindrance and on time, but it is necessary now to create the 
legislative basis and to create the organizational mechanisms 
which will make it possible to obtain from privatization much 
more than now. It is necessary to attract into it Russian and 
foreign investors in order to use this money for the 
technological renewal of production. 
  Of course, it is time to coordinate privatization with the 
structural and other areas of economic policy. The drafts of 
the Russian Civil Code and other top-priority laws will be sent 
to the State Duma very soon. Their adoption will lay a stable 
legal basis for the market economy and will help Russian 
entrepreneurship gain a firm foothold. Both parliament and the 
government need to support it, not only by adjusting regulation 
procedures but also by tax reform. 
  The urgent necessity of this is obvious, as is the 
difficulty 
of implementing it under inflationary conditions. All the same, 
tax reform must not be postponed until the summer, as is 
sometimes proposed. There are outlines and they should urgently 
be made use of. The system of settlements and the work of the 
banking system constitute a bottleneck in the reform. Profound 
changes are needed here, including reform of the Central Bank 
with the aim of creating a Russian federal reserve system and 
this should also be begun without unnecessary delays. The 
anti-monopoly reserve of the reforms needs to be skilfully 
managed. It is clear that the de-monopolization of our economy 
will require time. So preventive measures blocking the 
emergence of new monopolist structures are particularly 
important. 
  At the same time, we must not regard everybody as having 
been tarred with the same brush. Not every enterprise behaves 
as though it is a monopoly enterprise. Natural monopolies are 
another matter altogether -- an effective state control is 
needed here. 
  The system of management of state enterprises is to be 
seriously transformed this year. To be more precise, this 
system, to all intents and purposes, must be built anew. State 
property is being used in a most ineffective manner. State 
property, or at least a proportion of it, is here to stay and in 
this area the Federal Assembly and the government alike have a 
great deal to accomplish. 
  The importance of creating Russian financial and industrial 
groups is well known. It is a way to concentrate resources in 
growth areas and maintain investment activity and 
competitiveness. The government must find a correct line -- not 
to impede nor accelerate this process, but to control it, 
eliminating harmful effects. 
  The reform of economic mechanisms in the agrarian sector is 
a 
problem of enormous importance. It will continue to falter if 
no mechanism is created to implement the right to private 
ownership of land and if a modern banking infrastructure 
continues to be absent, along with a great deal else that is 
also lacking. 
  Financial discipline must be firmed up and this goes for the 
state itself, first and foremost. The primary task is to make 
inflation moderate, controllable, and predictable. The 
guidemark remains as before - about five percent per month 
toward the end of this year. The government has enshrined this 
mark in its program adopted on 6 August last year, and there is 
currently no convincing evidence to necessitate a review here. 
  It is, of course, necessary to bear in mind that, in 
Russia's 
present conditions, the war against inflation will be a 
positional [pozitsionnyy] one. I think that military 
terminology is fully appropriate in this matter. Inflation 
cannot be beaten by a single fierce attack. To win the battle, 
total coordination of the actions of the president, the Federal 
Assembly, and the government will be required. It is necessary 
to involve all the forces that are available, all resources -- 
both monetary-credit and financial and structural-investment 
resources--and fiscal policy. The inflation-proofing of the 
economy must be completely guaranteed. This is a vital political 
limitation from which we cannot depart. An exclusively 
inflationary budget is unacceptable. 
  The other limitation is the due level of social protection 
for those who are unable to do without state assistance. Any 
draft decisions causing the standard of living to fall below the 
minimum levels must be referred back for reconsideration. They 
are not to be implemented. This applies primarily to the budget. 
Any reduction in the share of expenditure on culture, science, 
and education is impermissible. 
  Acting within the framework of these limitations, the 
government has to immediately activate schemes to address the 
full acuteness of the nonpayments crisis. 
  This year, it is time to make a real start on registering 
debt in the form of securities, reorganizing and improving 
economically unviable enterprises, and applying the bankruptcy 
procedure. An economy in which factories calmly feel that 
they have no prospects will never be a truly market-based, 
efficient, and non-inflationary economy. 
  The government must at last launch a structural investment 
policy. Otherwise the technological retreat of Russian industry 
will not be halted, and we may lose even what little we have: 
industries which have kept their staff, technologies, and 
well-established positions in the world market, as well as our 
country's intellectual potential. We have no alternative now to 
using the potential of reforms to get us out of the crisis and 
restore the economy. I am convinced that together we are 
capable of making 1994 a year in which we see a steady fall in 
the inflation rate, stabilization of living standards, a 
significant slowdown in the decline of output, an increase in 
investment activity, and positive structural changes.

  [Text] Moscow March 4 (ITAR-TASS) -- "The Russian 
Government fully shares the objective of strengthening the 
Russian state as defined by the president in his message to the 
parliament," Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told the 
extended meeting of the Russian Government which opened in the 
Kremlin on Friday morning. 
  "This is the basis for continuing reform, an end to the 
crisis through economic restructuring and creating conditions 
for economic, political and social stabilisation", Chernomyrdin 
said. 
  "We see no ground and no possibility for radical changes in 
the course we are pursuing. The government will take guidance 
from the programme adopted last August and approved by the 
president. We shall stick to this programme and implement it no 
matter how difficult it may be," Chernomyrdin said in the 
meeting with ministers, leaders of state committees and other 
federal executive bodies, parliament chamber speakers, faction 
leaders and heads of local governments, as well as the leaders 
of interregional associations and public organisations, which is 
being held in the Kremlin to discuss the state and prospects for 
the development of the Russian national economy and road safety 
law," Chernomyrdin said. 
  The Russian Government is satisfied with neither the speed 
nor intensivity of reforms, nor is it satisfied with the quality 
of the work being done by management bodies on all levels, from 
the federal to the local. The government in full shares the 
president's alarm and the society's worries about the country's 
economic position, Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed. 
  However, he noted, there are no foundations for the drawing 
of hasty conclusions that a catastrophe is iminent or that 
reforms have stopped and it is necessary to turn back to 1992 in 
order to "renew" radical restructuring. It is permissible and 
necessary to argue about what has and has not been done and why. 
But it is not permissible to overlook the obvious: a market 
economy already exists in Russia. Now, the premier considers, 
the country needs to move on, taking into account the 
fundamental differences in the economic and political situation 
which has formed at the beginning of 1994, and paying attention 
to the lessons contained in the government's mistakes and 
programmes. 
  Summing up the year 1993, Chernomyrdin noted that the 
country 
was able to undertake significant steps towards the furthering 
of reforms despite the difficult internal political situation. 
The reasonably strict financial and monetary policy made it 
possible to control, and towards the end of the year, seriously 
lower the rate of inflation. Privatisation was carried out 
dynamically, and additional measures were taken to liberalize 
Russia's foreign economic activities. 
  Nevertheless, the country's economic situation remains 
alarming. The decline in industrial production grew towards the 
end of the year. We have stepped right up to the line, beyond 
which lies the irreversible destruction of our scientific and 
technical potential. The country's external economic position 
likewise remains tense. The problem of non-payments has again 
became more acute. 
  According to Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's budget was not 
able to fully pay for the goods produced for government needs or 
for several other obligations, including the payment of salaries 
in the budget sphere. Instead of searching for additional ways 
to strengthen the income base and rationalize expenses, 
"emergency" measures were undertaken. 
  Talk about the destructive effects of nonpayments on the 
financial status of enterprises, the budget, and the country as 
a whole has been going on for more than a year. In the end, 
there is still no full and operational account of mutual debts 
in the national economy. This problem is undoubtedly very 
complex, but, the premier stressed, at times the impression is 
produced that neither the Finance Ministry, the Economics 
Ministry, the State Property Committee, nor the Central Bank of 
Russia wants to deal with the issue. In the meantime, the 
situation is getting more complex every day. 
  Speaking about the trade ministries and departments, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin emphasized that it sometimes seems that their main 
goal is to wring more money and privileges for their 
enterprises, as though state policy and the government's 
realistic capabilities do not concern them. 
  Last fall, an action plan was adopted for the implementation 
of the first stage of the government programme. An analysis of 
the plan showed that of 88 assignments, only one half were 
actually carried out. Principally important decisions have not 
been put into practice, such as decisions on agricultural 
co-operative societies, on the develepment of agricultural loans 
and insurance, and the practical use of mortgages. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin expressed his opinion that ministry and 
department heads must look at the economy as a whole and carry 
out truly national policies. However, he stressed, far from all 
of these heads have been able to withstand the pressure from 
special interest lobbies, especially when these attacks were 
accompanied by a lot of noise, which contained political 
implications as well. In what kind of state, the premier asked 
rhetorically, are possible instances where electricity is turned 
off not only for television programmes, but even for civil 
flight monitoring. "democracy or no democracy, we will react to 
such things in the future very severely", Viktor Chernomyrdin 
noted. 
  The premier expressed his confidence that it is impossible 
to 
carry out reforms looking at the country and the people from the 
top down, without explaining anything or asking for the 
agreement of those, for whose sake the government is working. 
  Summarizing not only 1993, but the past two years connected 
with reforms, Viktor Chernomyrdin emphasized that, "it is 
necessary for us to first of all look at the new problems which 
the Russian economy is facing today". 
  First of all, he noted, there is a new situation regarding 
prices. Internal prices for the majority of goods and services 
(excluding energy sources), have approached world levels. This, 
on the one hand, has contributed to the saturation of the 
market, the unhindered establishment of new economic ties, and 
the development of trade and normal market relations. But, on 
the other hand, more and more enterprises have been exposed as 
unprofitable, ineffective, and incompetitive. 
  Second, the reasonably strict financial and monetary-credit 
policy has nevertheless brought certain benefits, although it 
was not able to stop inflation. The inflation rate, if one does 
not count january 1994, has noticeably decreased. It will be no 
more than 13-15 per cent in february, meaning, it will remain on 
the same level as the November-December, 1994 period. However, 
Viktor Chernomyrdin pointed out, the government is worried by 
the asymmetric reactions of the national economy to strict 
monetary policies: on the one hand, the increase in the money 
supply gives inflation a strong push, but, notwithstanding 
expectations, has not led to the stabilisation of production, 
and holds back the much-needed proccesses of essential 
restructuring in the production sphere. 
  At the same time, he noted, the lowering of the rate of 
increase of the money supply, without significantly effecting 
the level of prices, causes a sharp fall in production and 
increases enterprises' financial problems. This in particular 
is the result we have gotten from the tight control held over 
the money supply in the June-October, 1993 period. 
  Third, the premier said, the production decline in 1993 and 
the first months of this year has turned out to be more than was 
expected. Effectiveness is falling, we are faced with the 
threat of massive unemployment and the reduction of the means of 
production. In several sectors, the current level of production 
is no more than 50 per cent of the january, 1990 level. 
  The crisis has reached not only those sectors for which a 
large decline in production was predicted, but also those who 
produce competitve goods. In such conditions, the premier 
pointed out, it is obvious that the question goes deeper than 
the "more money, less money" level. Without a fairly strict 
financial and monetary policy, it will be impossible to do 
anything. 
  While we will not at all costs weaken efforts in the sphere 
of financial stabilisation, Viktor Chernomyrdin noted, we must 
act on the other aspects of russia's economic life no less 
decisively. 
  The answer, according to the government's opinion, lies in 
the solution of the following tasks: the strengthening of state 
power and the introduction of order into all areas of the 
economy and social life; the implementation of a balanced, 
reasonably strict financial policy; the decisive activation of 
the structural investment policy; significant changes in 
privatisation policy to aim it at not just transferring state 
property, but at improving the effectivene of production, at 
stimulating investments, and at the activation of basic 
restructuring; the use of all possibilities for the 
strengtheningof social policy to make reforms answer the 
people's needs and to neutralize the basic sources of 
dissatisfaction among the people; the consolidation of all the 
healthy forces in society to resolve the tasks of the new stage 
in refroms and to achieve national accord on that platform. 
  A special concern of the government remains the 
strengthening 
of the legal guarantees of market reforms, in connection with 
which the Cabinet of Ministers has sent the State Duma more than 
60 bills. 
  Turning to the problems faced by the agricultulral sector, 
the prime minister admitted that, "subsidies to agricultural 
producers are necessary, but now they are a burden on the budget 
and often ineffective". At the same time, he emphasized that 
agricultural subsidies create a threat to the other sectors of 
the economy. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin refuted press reports alleging that he 
is 
planning to give the farmers 34 trillion roubles in credits. 
"There is no such plan, and there will not be", he announced. 
Support of the agrarian sector will remain at the same level in 
1994 as it was at in 1993, and money will be handed out only 
when results are guaranteed and the purpose is completely clear, 
the head of the Cabinet of Ministers assured. 
  Then Chernomyrdin turned to the tasks which demand solutions 
in the next two or three months. The most important is the 
"creation of a mechanism for the resolution of the mutual 
non-payments problem in the national economy". Several means of 
battling this problem were named, including the compulsive 
registration and calculation of all the accounts of a given 
enterprise, including its foreign accounts, and stricter 
administrative and financial responsibility for the concealment 
of income sources. The introduction of a practical bankruptcy 
mechanism for those enterprises which cannot pay their debts is 
also envisaged. 
  The premier expressed his opinion that the economic 
situation 
requires "the decisive strengthening of the effectiveness of 
financial policy: we cannot afford the luxury of living a second 
year without an approved budget". 
  As work on the draft budget for 1994 is being wrapped up, 
the 
main task remains that of not allowing the budget deficit to 
grow. However, Viktor Chernomyrdin named a different figure 
approximating inflation at the end of the year than President 
Yeltsin did in his introductory address. While Boris Yeltsin 
named an orientation figure of 5 per cent, the premier brought 
forward 7-9 per cent. In doing so, Viktor Chernomyrdin hedged 
his words by saying that the government intends to conduct an 
active search for reserves, "which would allow us to 
consistently approach the 3-5 orientation figure for inflation 
at the end of the year, which was mentioned in the president's 
address". 
  Financial stabilisation is impossible to achieve without an 
effective tax system, the speaker declared. Among its top 
priority jobs, the government is bent on simplifying and 
organizing the tax collection procedure, refusing enterprises 
and districts in their requests for individual privileges, and 
strengthening the tax collection service. At the same time as 
these measures are being carried out, the tax regulations will 
be perfected. 
  Reporting that the federal budget in 1993 did not recieve 
7.5 
trillion roubles, or about 30 per cent of the income which it 
had forecast for itself, Chernomyrdin demanded that the internal 
revenue personnel, which number 135 thousand, improve the 
effectiveness of their work. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin paid special attention to the 
fundamental 
reorganization of mutual budget relations between the center and 
the regions. At the base of the new system of budget federalism 
will lie common rules on the allocation of state expenditure and 
income between the federal budget and the budgets of the Russian 
Federation's many component parts. The main principles and 
purposes of the budget relations reform were defined in the 
president's state-of-the-federation address and his order from 
December 23, 1993. 
  The 1994 budget will be based on the actual state of 
affairs. 
"Our choice is fairly limited", the premier noted, "if we let 
inflation have its head, we will end up in a spiral fall which 
we will not be able to get out of. If we stop production, we 
will end up with a seething country, collapse, and chaos. 
Today's most important question is to walk literally along the 
edge of a razor, without falling to one side or the other". 
  Structural investment policy was named as one of the 
priorities of economic reform. Chernomyrdin noted that the 
government is going to adopt a radical re-allocation of budget 
means, increasing the amount of government investments. They 
should amount to three per cent of the gross national product. 
Three-quarters of the over-all budget means ear-marked for 
capital investments are proposed to transfer to the financing of 
the construction of federally-important projects envisaged in 
current government programmes. 
  Taking this into account, the government is correcting its 
investment programme for 1994. Of the 86 federal programmes 
which have already been approved and presented to the 
government, about 40 will be implemented. The mechanism of 
extending subsidies and credits is also being reviewed. Their 
share as a percentage of all budget allocations will be lowered 
from 9 per cent to 7.4 per cent. 
  The government is beginning to get tough on ineffective 
businesses, many of which will have to be shut down. Along with 
these steps, the government will assist the implementation of 
large-scale investment projects which have importance for the 
future of the Russian economy and are being carried out with the 
help of foreign capital. 
  According to Chernomyrdin, government money will bring the 
most profit if it is allocated on a commercial basis through 
banks and other financial institutions. 
  The government head urged entrepreneurs, bankers, and the 
heads of large joint stock companies to increase their 
participation in investment projects and attract more capital to 
the Russian market. 
  Chernomyrdin called privatization one of the most important 
methods of fundamentally restructuring the economy. He noted 
that the voucher privatization programme must be finished by the 
first of July. A new stage in the government's privatization 
policy is due to begin in the second half of this year. Its 
basic form will be commercial and investment competitions with 
strict regulations which are to ensure the reorganization and 
restructuring of enterprises and the inflow of investments, 
including from abroad. In 1994 privatization should become a 
sort of locomotive of reforms on the local level. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin called social policy the weakest part of 
the government's work. The government has recently been working 
hard on the formation of a more active social policy. First of 
all, direct aid to the needy will be increased and and the 
financial base of the corresponding funds will be reinforced. 
  From April first, the amount paid out in existing pensions 
will be recalculated. The next step will be a new pension law, 
the draft of which will be presented for discussion to the 
Federal Assembly. 
  Speaking about the gradual restoration of citizens' savings, 
Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed that this will be done first of all 
for veterans. Part of their savings will be restored by the 
transfer of pieces of state property, such as stocks in state 
enterprises or land. 
  The premier judged that unemployment has begun to make 
itself 
felt. Open unemployment is still not very large, but already 
almost four million people are being forced to work on a 
part-time basis. He said it is now necessary to think about the 
organization of social projects, such as the construction of 
living accomodations, roads, bridges, and other socially 
important things. 
  Touching upon the question of the activation of income 
policy, Chernomyrdin stressed, "we are going to begin a stricter 
progressive tax policy on high and extra-high incomes, require 
the declaration of incomes when making large purchases, and 
change the real estate tax policy". The regulations concerning 
enterprises' expenditure on wages are also changing, he said. 
One more step will be the introduction by the government of an 
official minimum living standard, to which will be tied the 
minimal wage and minimal pensions. 
  Chernomyrdin called the sharp increase in housing a 
nation-wide task. He reported that the government has already 
adopted a packet of regulations on the development of the credit 
system in the housing sphere and on subsidies for the 
construction and purchase of living quarters. The subsidies 
would go to those who have been waiting in state lines for 
years, military personnel, and other "privileged people". 
Non-budget ways of financing housing construction are also to 
be developed. 
  Chernomyrdin admitted that the government cannot afford to 
give the sciences, education, and culture all the finances from 
the federal budget which these spheres deserve. The science and 
higher education systems cannot survive without rationalising 
their activities, wisely redistributing their resources, and 
getting rid of extra organizations. 
  The premier said the government is worried about the battle 
against crime. He reported that there are still very few 
concrete, effective measures which would decrease the tension 
around the growing threats to society and peoples' safety. The 
government is determined to undertake severe steps towards 
freeing state structures from the influence of mafia elements, 
organized crime, and corrupt people, no matter what position the 
suspect holds. 
  As far as the political aspects of Russian society's life 
go, 
Chernomyrdin expressed his hope that the political amnesty will 
"all the same become a step towards reconciliation and not 
towards a new round of confrontation and destabilization". "The 
president and government will act as sure guarantors so that 
events do not take such a turn", the prime minister announced. 
  Chernomyrdin sharply condemned exaggerated rumours about his 
presidential aspirations. "I am not one of those handymen who 
are ready to go right from manager to minister and then to 
president", he said. He considers it "unethical to carry on any 
conversations on the presidential theme while the current 
president is still functioning". 
  In his conclusion, Viktor Chernomyrdin called for all the 
branches of power to reach an agreement, which would be helped 
by the new constitution and the basic conceptions of national 
security as expressed in the president's address. Russia has a 
parliament and a government, and it has, finally, the general 
desire of its peoples to restore their country to its status as 
a great, powerful, and prosperous state, the head of the Cabinet 
of Ministers emphasized.

  [Text] Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian 
Government, delivered an analytical report on the state of the 
country's economy and the prospects for its development at an 
expanded meeting of the government in the Kremlin today. He 
said that the government totally shares the provisions of the 
message from President Boris Yeltsin to the Federal Assembly: 
  [Begin Chernomyrdin recording] The crisis has affected not 
only those sectors which were forecast to suffer the greatest 
reduction in production but also those which produce products 
which are, in principle, competitive and consumer goods which 
are in demand. In these conditions it is evident that the 
question can no longer be put simply in terms of more money or 
less money. It is clear that without a sufficiently tough 
financial and monetary policy it will not be possible to achieve 
anything, just as it has not been possible in other countries. 
But it seems that it will hardly be possible to radically 
improve the state of affairs in the country using only this 
means. 
  The government today has great responsibility for the course 
of the reforms, for what they will cost millions of people, for 
the political temperature of the young Russian democracy which 
is undergoing a complicated time of its self-determination both 
in the country and in the world as a whole. 
  I cannot today avoid mentioning a problem which is extremely 
important for me, personally and for the government which I 
head. What is at issue is that of late in some of the mass media 
a noisy campaign has been unleashed with the aim of proving that 
the chairman of the government is allegedly concentrating power, 
that he is taking too much onto himself in order to get himself 
onto the presidential chair. Even some polls have begun to be 
held on this theme. Let me say honestly and frankly that I am 
not one of those clever people who can do everything who are 
prepared to ascend in one leap from being head of a laboratory 
to being a minister, deputy minister or premier or even at times 
president. 
  I must say in the first place that Russia is not a racing 
car, which you can get into, go for a spin and get out of again; 
and after this the whole country trembles like in a fever. 
Second, I consider that it is impermissible and simply idiotic 
to have any discussion about the presidency while we have an 
existing president. We have one nationwide leader, elected by 
the whole people and I do not intend to intrigue against him. I 
am not like that. 
  Third, some people, including some of you, are making vain 
attempts to drive a wedge between the president and the chairman 
of the government, trying to cause trouble between us, and this 
will not succeed. It is futile to try. 
  Today, accord is needed by all of us, by all branches of 
power, by all leaders, no matter what posts they occupy. Accord 
is needed by the whole people. [end recording]

  [Text] At an expanded meeting of the government in the 
Kremlin on Friday deputies of the State Duma and leaders of 
executive bodies from a number of regions sharply criticized the 
Cabinet's activities. 
  Thus, the chairman of the State Duma's committee on economic 
reform, Sergey Glazyev, accused the government of lacking an 
anti-crisis program of reforms. He described the prime 
minister's report as a declaration of intentions. In his 
opinion, the government has lost control over the economic 
processes. He also noted that the president and the Cabinet 
virtully ingore any economic initiatives and proposals of the 
parliament. 
  According to Glazyev, the main confrontation in society is 
not between supporters and opponents of reform, but between 
those who favor establishing law and order and those who "swing 
the boat stirring up confrontation." In the opinion of the 
deputy, such people work in all branches and structures of power. 
  St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak warned that the 
country 
is now "on the brink of a financial catastrophe," and unless 
urgent measures are taken there will be mass stoppages of 
enterprises and freezing of social programs. Sobchak spoke in 
favor of cancelling the compulsory character of the 
privatization program adopted by the government at the 
initiative of the State Property Committee, giving regions the 
right to carry out privatization according to their own 
programs. The St. Petersburg mayor accused the Cabinet of not 
wanting to transfer part of the budget deficit burden on 
regions' shoulders. 
  Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin did not agree with 
that point of view. He noted that regions are entitled to 
impose their own taxes and form their own budgets. The acting 
finance minister pointed out that the government can hold 
inflation down with shock methods and knows how to do that. 
However, it does not set such a goal because this would 
threaten to cause grave social consequences in the future.

  [Text] Moscow March 4 TASS -- Russia's Gross Domestic 
Product in 1993 amounted to 162.3 trillion roubles, down 12 per 
cent from 1992 and 29 per cent in comparison with 1991, the year 
of the beginning of radical economic reform in Russia. Are, 
according to the Russian Statistics Committee said in a report 
circulated among participants in the extended meeting of the 
Russian government which opened in the Kremlin on Friday 
morning. [sentence as received] 
  President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin are meeting with ministers, leaders of state 
committees and other federal executive bodies, as well as 
parliament chamber speakers, faction leaders and heads of local 
governments, as well as the leaders of interregional 
associations and public organisations to discuss the state and 
prospects for the development of the russian national economy. 
  The report says the volume of industrial production in the 
country dropped by 31.3 per cent from 1991 through 1993, the 
consumer goods production by 24.8 per cent, food products by 
27.3 per cent. 
  Capital investments in 1993 amounted to 51 per cent of the 
1991 level. Fifteen per cent fewer new houses were built. 
  Last year's trade turnover reached 58.8 trillion roubles, 2 
per cent up from 1992. 
  The Russian transportation system carried 3.6 billion tonnes 
in 1993, one quarter less than in 1992, and 43 per cent less 
than in 1991. 
  Russia's total exports last year are valued at 43 billion 
U.S. dollars, 1.4 percent more than in 1992, but 16 per cent 
less than in 1991. Imports reached 27 billion dollars, 73 per 
cent of the 1992 level and 61 per cent of the 1991 level. 
  The budget deficit in 1993 is expected to amount to 11 
trillion roubles (seven per cent of the Gross Domestic Product), 
an 18-fold increase from 1992, while the inflation growth rate 
grew ten times. 
  Unemployment in Russia reached 3.8 million people (as 
calculated in accordance with ILO [International Labor 
Organization] methods), of which 835 thousand are formally 
recognised as jobless. This is 13.5 times more than in 1991. 
  39.6 million Russians, or 26.7 per cent of the total 
population, received registered incomes below the survival 
minimum. Real incomes in 1993 decreased by 43 per cent from 
1991, and the aggregate index of consumer prices soared 245 
times during the same period, the statistics reports circulated 
among participants in the extended meeting of the Russian 
government in the Kremlin today attended by President Yeltsin, 
ministers, leaders of state committees and other federal 
executive bodies, parliament chamber speakers, faction leaders 
and heads of local governments, as well as the leaders of 
interregional associations and public organisations. 
  Statisticians told the Russian government that the fuel and 
energy sector produced in 1993 less electricity, oil, natural 
gas and coal in comparison with 1992. Electricity generation 
dropped by 6 per cent, the production of oil, including gas 
condensate, shrank by 14 per cent, of natural gas by 0.4 per 
cent and of coal by 5 per cent. Nonetheless oil exports to 
foreign countries increased 1.2 times from 1992 to 79 million 
tonnes, while supplies to Commonwealth and Baltic countries were 
cut by almost one half. 
  In their agrarian sector land redistribution and 
privatisation went ahead along with social and structural 
reforms. 24,000 of collective and state farms, or 95 per cent 
of their total number, had re-registered by the end of 1993 as 
partnerships, farming cooperatives or other organisational and 
legal entities. State-owned agricultural enterprises now 
control no more than 15 per cent of all farmland. Individual 
private farmers own five per cent of farmland and six per cent 
of all arable land. 
  The gross production of agriculture dwindled by four per 
cent 
in 1993 in comparison with 1991 (in comparable prices), 
including by 2 per cent in horticulture and by 5 per cent in 
livestock farming. 
  The country harvested 99 million tonnes of grain in 1993, 
seven per cent less than in 1992. Meat production also reduced 
by 7 per cent from 1992, while the output of milk remained at 
the same level. 
  From January through November of 1993, as many as 39,000 
enterprises were privatised, making a total of 86,000 
enterprises since the beginning of privatisation in Russia.

  [Text] Moscow, 4 Mar -- "The development of the economic 
situation in Russia is being determined to an ever greater 
extent by the progress of the implementation of economic reform 
and the degree of consistency and coordination of the changes 
taking place", stresses the Russian Federation Ministry of the 
Economy report "On the state of the Russian economy in 1993 and 
the prospects for its development in 1994." It has been 
circulated in the Kremlin among the participants in an extended 
session of the Russian government. 
  The Ministry of Economy report, which runs to nearly 200 
pages, notes that at the first stage of reform, by the summer of 
1992, it was possible to slow inflation, to reduce the budget 
deficit and to normalize the consumer market. However, the 
subsequent wholesale advancement of credits to the economy, 
which merely temporarily "suppressed" the problem of 
non-payments, put a brake on structural changes. Acknowledging 
that part of the credits was enforced -- for the agro-industrial 
complex and supplying goods to the Far North -- the authors of 
the report, nevertheless, point out that at the end of 1992 the 
credits of the Central Bank of Russia "were excessive." As a 
result the country began 1993 with a considerable slump in 
production and a sharp reduction in investment activity, 
threatened with a high rate of inflation. 
  "In 1993, in the difficult conditions of the domestic 
political situation and confrontation with the government by the 
various branches of power, it did, nevertheless, prove possible 
to take substantial steps towards further advancing the 
reforms," the report stresses. "Efforts were concentrated on 
conducting a moderately tight financial and monetary-credit 
policy with the aim of reducing inflation, further liberalizing 
external economic activities through restricting the sphere of 
licensing and quota imposition, cutting import subsidies, and 
switching to a unified foreign-currency exchange rate for the 
ruble, and were concentrated on other areas." 
  The adoption from the first months of the year of tough 
measures aimed at improving the situation as regards the budget 
and, primarily, at cutting budget expenditure was, in the view 
of the report's compilers, one of the most vital components of 
the anti-inflation policy. 
  According to the results for the year, the budget deficit 
amounted to 6 percent of the Gross Domestic Product [GDP], or to 
about 10 per cent of GDP if one takes account of expenditure 
arising from providing credit to the CIS countries, granting 
preferential credit to enterprises and subsidizing centralized 
imports. There is still budget indebtedness to state-financed 
organizations as regards paying for the output of agriculture, 
the defense sectors and the coal industry. "It is, therefore, 
too early to speak of a solution to the problems in the finance 
field. A carefully-considered restriction policy is needed 
here." 
  The document adds that monetary and credit policy was 
pursued 
much more consistently in 1993. Its restrictive nature made it 
possible "to reduce somewhat the inflationary pressure in the 
economy" and to avert hyperinflation. "At the same time, 
inflation is still rather high, and it is premature to speak of 
a definitive breakthrough in its dynamics. In 1993 as a whole, 
consumer prices rose by a factor of 9.4 and producer prices by a 
factor of 10." 
  Speaking of the increase in nonpayments among enterprises, 
the authors of the report point out that although the relative 
scale of nonpayments in 1993 was much smaller than in 1992, 
"their impact on enterprises rose considerably". By the end of 
1993, 3,262 enterprises were standing idle, mainly because of 
nonpayments. "The main cause of falling output now is not the 
breakdown of economic links, but limits on demand and the lack 
of money and customers." 
  The Ministry of Economics officials point out that "the 
process of removal of state control and privatization developed 
dynamically and on a large scale in 1993. The position of the 
nonstate sector of the economy, which is already directly 
employing over 30 million people, or more than 40 per cent of 
the workforce, is growing stronger." About 70 percent of trade, 
catering and service enterprises have been privatized. Over 
one-third of large and medium-sized enterprises, accounting for 
some 40 per cent of industrial output, are in private or mixed 
ownership. 
  It is also noted that the process of implementation of a 
transition to the development of a single Russian agricultural 
market regulated by new market methods has begun. Partnerships 
in various forms, which now number 11,500, have become the main 
organizational and legal form of management in the countryside. 
  At the same time, the report stresses that "the quantitive 
parameters of the privatization process (the increase in its 
speed and scale) are running ahead of the qualitative aspects. 
Privatization is not yet realizing its full potential, and its 
influence on the nature and efficiency of production is weak... 
The overall proportion of production in private ownership is 
still small (below 5 percent), and it is not yet having a major 
impact on the establishment of a competitive environment." 
  The authors of the report point out that the measures taken 
by the government to support production in priority areas helped 
to prevent a disastrous slump in production and to slow down the 
rate of the slump. "At the same time we could not overcome the 
inertia of the economic slump. The GDP for the year as a whole 
was 12 percent below that of 1992, and industrial production 16 
percent below." 
  The document states that "certain positive changes were 
outlined in the social sphere," and the consumer market, which 
was almost completely destroyed by the end of 1991, has been 
restored and is actively functioning. Supply of goods has 
expanded, disposable monetary incomes of the population have 
increased by 11 percent and the average monthly salaries of 
workers, calculated in dollars, increased from $32 in January to 
$114 in January 1993. In the structure of consumer expenditure 
of the population the proportion of expenditure on food has 
begun to fall and actual consumption of meat and meat products, 
confectionery and a number of other products has increased. 
  At the same time the acute problems in the social sphere 
have 
not been overcome. Approximately one-third of the country's 
population has incomes below the subsistence wage and this 
proportion is higher than in previous years. The rapidly 
increasing differentiation of the population in terms of incomes 
and supply of material requirements is becoming a source of 
tension in society. 
  This creates a climate for an exacerbation of social 
conflict. The report notes that both the foreign economic and 
currency position of the country remains tense. Despite the 
considerable positive balance in current foreign currency 
operations in 1993 (as a result first of all of a considerable 
reduction in import), Russia is experiencing a lack of foreign 
currency funds for maintaining the necessary investment activity 
and ensuring the restructuring and clearing the foreign debt. 
Out of the total amount of increase in foreign currency funds 
on the accounts of enterprises and commercial banks, assessed at 
$21-22,000 million, a considerable part is being held in 
deposits in foreign banks. 
  At the present stage of economic reforms, for which the year 
1993 is noted, "there have been both considerable progress in a 
number of areas of creation of the market economy mechanism and 
high costs brought about by the inevitable expenditures of the 
transition period, the legacy of a top-heavy economy and 
serious errors in the implementation of the reform itself, 
aggravated by the confrontation of political forces in 1993," 
the report stresses. 
  At the same time it quotes data in accordance to which 
"crime 
is bringing a considerable negative influence to bear on the 
country's socio-economic situation." The greatest danger is 
represented by organized crime, which "not only is laying claim 
to leadership in the economy, but is also trying to invade 
politics and is lobbying power structures at all levels". As 
the reports notes, criminal groups control over 35,000 persons 
in management positions, including some 1,500 in the state 
sector of the economy. According to experts' estimates, from 30 
to 50 percent of the revenue of organized crime is used for 
bribing civil servants. 
  In 1994, the Russian Government intends to lower the 
inflation rate to 400 percent for the year as a whole and to 
slow down the pace of economic decline with a fall in the GDP to 
5-7 percent as opposed to 12 per cent in 1993, the Economy 
Ministry report says. 
  The government intends to abide consistently by a policy of 
economic reform in accordance with the government action program 
for 1993-95, adopted on 6th August 1993, and also to promptly 
adopt suitable measures to resolve problems arising during the 
carrying out of economic transformations. 
  Vital components of the implementation in 1994 of the policy 
adopted will, in the opinion of Economy Ministry experts, be the 
conducting of a moderately tight financial and monetary policy 
aimed at noticeably reducing the pace of inflation and improving 
the financial position of enterprises; the continuation of 
institutional transformations, reforming state enterprises and a 
change in the practice of privatization; ensuring a selective 
state policy of structural investment; and an invigoration of 
social policy. 
  The report points out that measures will be taken in 1994 to 
reform the fiscal system, strengthen the revenue part of the 
budget and boost the effectiveness of the use of state means. 
"The main task is to make financial policy effective, 
controllable and more predictable, and to gear it to the 
accomplishment of long-term, as well as current, tasks." 
  As far as privatization is concerned, here the government 
intends to speed up the process and to help to bring it into 
closer contact with restructuring, regional policy, the 
stabilization of the work of branches of the economy and with 
improving stability in society. "Voucher" privatization will 
come to an end in the country by 1 July 1994. The privatization 
of medium-sized and large enterprises will continue. The 
document notes that privatization "should be carried out taking 
account of preserving viable technological structures, 
strengthening stable economic links and interproduction 
cooperation and should prevent the formation of several nonstate 
monopolists in the place of one state monopolist, thus 
restricting the emergence of a number of pockets of price rises. 
Questions of appraising property liable to privatization, 
benefits whhich may be granted and the procedure of and 
conditions for the sale of enterprises or share packages 
belonging to the state should be decided in a new way." 
  The report notes that selective, "targeted" state support 
for 
those enterprises which determine the structural improvement of 
the economy and which manufacture a competitive end product and 
are of key importance for the reorganization of the economy as a 
whole, has been planned for 1994. 
  The report lists the following as highly important social 
policy priorities: achievement of stabilization of the 
population's standard of living, active influence on the labour 
market, expansion of motivation for the economically active 
population to engage in work and business, prevention of mass 
and static unemployment, intensification of targeted support for 
the least well-protected sections of the population, state 
support for industries providing social services, and the 
provision of a guaranteed minimum of free health and social 
services, education and housing. The government regards "the 
more equal and just distribution of the burden of the economic 
crisis among the various sections of the population" as a new 
important task. 
  Only the sufficiently full and consistent implementation of 
the measures outlined by the government to improve the 
efficiency of the use of state resources and to increase the 
functioning of market mechanisms will make it possible to take 
the necessary step in 1994 towards creating the conditions in 
which the Russian economy can be revived and the economic crisis 
overcome in 1995, the report stresses.

  [Text] Moscow March 4 TASS -- The Russian Government has 
instructed all executive power bodies "to pay special attention 
to the development and implementation of measuring aiming to 
raise the living standards, lower the inflation rates, settle 
the non-payment problem, stabilize and increase industrial and 
agricultural production, develop competition, boost 
institutional changes and upgrade the economic system and the 
system of state control", says a resolution "on state of the 
Russian economy and prospects for its development in 1994". 
  The resolution was approved today by an expanded government 
meeting. Ministries and departments were instructed to 
elaborate a document with due account of additions and proposals 
put forward at the meeting. 
  The resolution also basically approved a plan of government 
priorities resulting from the presidential message to the 
Federal Assembly "On consolidation of the Russian state". The 
plan offers measures for stabilization of the living standards, 
a comprehensive reform of social services, including social 
guarantees to families with low income and paid services for 
families with stable finances, more equal distribution of the 
economic crisis burden between various groups of the population 
and gradual compensation of savings that were brought to naught 
by price liberalization. 
  It is planned to adopt this month a general agreement 
between 
all-Russian trade union associations, unions of employees and 
the government for 1994 with the aim of consolidation of social 
partnership. 
  The plan includes measures for reform in the health care 
system in order to prevent decreased medical services to the 
population, as well as measures for support of science and 
culture. 
  The government will prepare a draft law on reorganization of 
the Russian banking system, a draft taxation code and a draft 
presidential decree on boosted activities of the taxation 
service. 
  The government will prepare in March a state program of 
demonopolization of the economy and development of competition 
on Russian markets and a draft resolution on state selective 
structural policy. 
  The government plan includes measures to upgrade federalism 
fundamentals and consolidate the integrity of state and Russian 
economic unity. 
  The resolution recognized it necessary to create conditions 
for the formation in 1994 of financial-industrial groups, 
sufficient investment activities and more efficient use of 
scientific and technical achievements. 
  It also urges the need for specification of the Russian 
privatization concept in connection with the end of validity of 
privatization vouchers on July 1, 1994.

  [Text] Moscow March 3 TASS -- Russia's budget for 1994 "is 
likely to be the first truthful budget", it has no "seamy 
sides", Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said at 
today's government meeting which discussed a draft federal 
budget presented by the Finance Ministry. "We will have to take 
great efforts" to achieve the targets envisaged by it, the 
premier stressed. 
  During the discussion, some senior executives of ministries 
and agencies stressed the need for more spending in such spheres 
as housing construction, social welfare, science, environmental 
protection. Thus, Culture Minister Yevgeniy Sidorov said we 
should not "fight inflation by cutting down expenditures" for 
culture, which are to account for 0.3 per cent of the total 
budget expenditures. "With such a budget, the social sphere will 
be gradually dying, which is to affect, sooner or later, the 
economy and the entire situation in the country", he stressed. 
  Agriculture Minister Viktor Khlystun noted that the draft 
budget did not provide for allocations of about 5 trillion 
roubles to back the agro-industrial complex, which were 
envisaged by the government decision promising support for 
agriculture in 1994. 
  A speech by Labour Minister Gennadiy Melikyan was extremely 
emotional. He predicted that the proposed 1994 budget would be 
implemented for about two or three months only, and then 
violations are inevitable, the same as it happened to Russia's 
two previous federal budgets. He stressed that "the draft 
budget has very little to do with a real economic policy, it 
simply sets a tight course for stabilizing the economy by 
reducing budget spending". The labour minister called upon the 
government to work out effective measures to encourage 
production, including through adequate taxation. 
  Melikyan was backed by First Deputy Defence Minister Andrey 
Kokoshin, who described the draft budget as "politically 
dangerous". He also reported that the defence ministry collegium 
had estimated the envisaged expenditures for national security 
as extremely unsufficient. "It will literally ruin the country's 
defence capability", the collegium stressed. A shortage of 
state funding is to bring about "an immediate dismissal of 
400,000 servicemen and to fully terminate purchases of military 
equipment", according to Kokoshin. 
  The prime minister argued that all ministries and agencies 
demanding extra spending should take into consideration the 
current complicated situation in the country. "Now we are on the 
verge of an abyss, beyond which we will just collapse... For 
this reason, the draft budget is rather tight, we should 
determine how to overcome this crisis with the lowest losses", 
Chernomyrdin told the gathering. "We do not need either 
hyperinflation or a simmering country. And we have two levers 
to control this -- power and order", he emphasised. 
  On the premier's proposal, the draft budget was approved in 
principle. The Finance Ministry was instructed to finalize it 
within ten days. In doing so, it should "by no means increase 
items of expenditure, otherwise we will face a catastrophe".

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report No. 9 of 59] </F>
  [Text] The political amnesty for those who plotted the 
August 1991 coup and who were involved in last September-October 
events has been commented on in the news media by Russian 
officials of different ranks, very highly placed among them. 
The amnestied themselves also expressed their views concerning 
the State Duma decision. Interfax's correspondent Vyacheslav 
Terekhov interviewed the last USSR President, Mikhail Gorbachev, 
in this connection. 
  Corr.: What is your attitude to the State Duma decision on 
dropping legal proceedings against those who plotted the August 
1991 coup, those responsible for last May's bloodshed, and the 
leaders of last October's disturbances in Moscow? 
  Mikhail Gorbachev: In my view, it was not too easy for the 
State Duma to take such a decision. Nevertheless it's 
noteworthy that three-fourths of the deputies in the lower house 
of Russia's parliament voted for it. As a matter of fact, each 
of the Duma members realized that the voting will not be secret, 
and that the stand taken by each of them will become known to 
the public -- the names of all of them will be mentioned. 
Seeking to be unbiased, I cannot disregard this fact. 
  Nevertheless, my attitude to this problem is ambivalent. In 
the first place, the amnesty concerned a group of people 
involved in the events connected with the attempted coup of 1991 
-- people whose actions led to breaking up the country. As for 
the events of last September and October, when Russia's Supreme 
Council was abolished, Moscow was virtually bathed in blood. 
These two issues should be clearly distinguished. 
  As for my own attitude, I have always stood for carrying the 
trial of those who plotted the 1991 coup through, and with 
maximal openness. Otherwise the country will learn no lesson 
from that sad experience. 
  Corr.: Pointing to the need to observe openness in the 
coverage of the trial, you evidently wish to be absolved from 
the charges that you were aware of the plotters' plans, and 
shared their intention to impose a state of emergency in the 
USSR, as some of the plotters claim? 
  M.G.: Indeed, during the trial some initiators of the coup 
came out with such charges against me at the advice of their 
lawyers. I have repeatedly refuted them, in interviews with 
journalists also. 
  Another issue I would like to draw attention to concerns the 
conduct of Ivan Rybkin (Interfax's note: the chairman of 
Russia's State Duma). I am not acquainted with him, I have 
never met him. However my impression is that he is a tactfull 
and reserved man, who can control his own emotions. I would not 
say that he is prone to extremism. 
  I saw Rybkin act rather sharply for the first time precisely 
when he was upholding the need to grant political amnesty to 
those who had taken part in the 1991 and 1993 events, which was 
supported by a majority of Duma members. Some considerations 
prompted me to conclude that the resoluteness of his actions 
could be explained by the circumstance that the speaker of the 
lower house of parliament had settled this issue with Russia's 
president... 
  Corr.: But a majority of political analysts do not share 
this viewpoint. 
  M.G.: I expressed my own opinion. I believe that the 
resolution on political amnesty Rybkin was "pushing through" the 
Duma was too serious not to have been discussed with the Russian 
president preliminarily. The circumstance that Boris Yeltsin 
paid no attention to this topic and seemed to distance himself 
from it when the amnestied were released, while the presidential 
team reacted to the amnesty as if it were a kind of coup d'etat, 
must delude no one. 
  Please believe me, that I cannot get rid of the thought that 
all these steps had been agreed with the president, since the 
commission for investigating the October 3-4 events set up under 
the Duma, and the very trial of those who plotted the 1991 coup, 
are questions too serious to be resolved without discussing them 
with the head of state. 
  I would like to draw attention to the fact that this 
involves 
an amnesty, not full pardon. In other words, in legal terms 
these issues have not been finally settled. No one has 
cancelled the criminal cases instituted against some defendants 
and the verdicts pronounced against other participants in the 
events of August 1991, last May and last September-October. 
That is amnesty does not signify rehabilitation. 
  Corr.: But the main thing is that the legal proceedings are 
stopped, isn't it? 
  M.G.: No one calls this fact in question. What really 
matters is this -- lawyers believe that not only those who have 
already been convicted can be granted amnesty. I am a jurist 
myself, and that is why I believe that this amnesty, which is a 
constitutional prerogative of the State Duma, spreads to those 
who are already serving their sentences, to those whose cases 
are being considered by courts of law, and to those who are 
under investigation. The amnesty "closes" all these cases. 
  Therefore the jurists -- they even include professors -- who 
maintain that the State Duma resolution is unlawful are not 
right. In my opinion, from the legal point of view it's hard to 
describe the resolution issued by the lower house of parliament 
as faulty. 
  However the main problem does not lie in this, but in the 
motives for announcing this amnesty. If its goal was to promote 
national reconciliation, it can only be welcomed. Russia is on 
the brink of an abyss now -- disintegration is threatening it. 
Time has come to put all quarrels aside and save the state and 
the people from discord and strife. This is how the 
consequences of the civil war in Spain were liquidated under 
Franco. 
  In August of 1991 irreparable damage was done to the country 
-- I mean the Soviet Union. The coup affected myself directly. 
But I place the interests of Russia and Russians above my own, 
provided that the amnesty will really help to preserve the 
country's integrity. 
  But the amnesty will bring only a disaster, if 
representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party or communists 
begin to declare that the amnesty is their victory over the 
democrats, if Russian Choice starts to urge people to take to 
the streets and call for dissolving the Duma. 
  However I am an optimist by nature, and I hope that 
political 
accord in the country will be gained; at least I wish very much 
that this would happen. Russia can be saved from disaster only 
on this condition. But if the conflicting sides begin once 
again to look for winners and losers and revert to mutual 
threats, then the chairman of the State Duma's defence 
committee, Sergey Yushenkov, who said that to adopt that amnesty 
was a step toward a civil war, will prove to be right. 
  Corr.: Don't you think that there is a third way to cope 
with the situation -- to hush it up and pretend that nothing 
important has happened? 
  M.G.: In my view, such manner of behavior would create 
conditions for continuing to topple presidents, dissolve 
legislatures and shoot parliaments with impunity. This should 
be openly explained to the people, since a precedent for 
disbanding a constitutional organ with impunity must not be 
created -- this would be very bad for the country and for the 
Russian people. However I hope that history will put everything 
in its proper place.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 43 (533): </F>
Reports by Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor 
Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] "Those who have been granted amnesty by the State 
Duma will be arrested again in accordance with the law if they 
engage in any activity threatening the Russian state's 
security," Boris Yeltsin stated on Thursday [3 March] opening a 
regular meeting of the Security Council. 
  Observers point to the rigid tone of Boris Yeltsin's 
statement. 
  In accordance with the political amnesty resolution, the 
defendants figuring in the trial over the organizers of 
last-October's disturbances, among them Aleksandr Rutskoy and 
Ruslan Khasbulatov, were freed from the Lefortovo jail last 
Saturday. 
  Yeltsin said that the crime situation was very serious in 
Russia and that organized crime had risen to an inter-reguional 
and international levels. Russian criminals are penetrating 
into the former Soviet republics and foreign countries, he said. 
  Yeltsin believes that this is tied to the Russian law 
enforcement bodies' inefficient work. He said that he attached 
great importance to the federal program of combating crime for 
1994-95 which will be discussed by the Security Council. 
  "The Russian citizens must be confident that the government 
can be effective against crime," he said. 
  IF [INTERFAX] Note: In his February 24th message to 
parliament the president said that the implementation of 
measures planned in the program is connected with corresponding 
financing, which will compel Russia's parliament to take "hard 
budgetary decisions. No matter how hard the economic situation 
in the country is, there is a need to do all in human power to 
satisfy the most urgent financial and material requirements of 
the law-enforcement agencies," Yeltsin stressed. In his 
message the president points to the need to dismantle 
interdepartment barriers and liquidate the legal and 
organizational confusion in the work of the law-enforcement 
agencies. He also mentions the need to form in the structure of 
the Interior Ministry a strictly centralized system of units for 
combating organized crime, and provide them without delay with 
the best personnel, equipment and finances.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yekaterina Zhilyakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 3 TASS -- "If (Josef) Stalin was alive 
today, he would be also rehabilitated by the State Duma," Yuriy 
Chernichenko, a member of the Federation Council, said. 
  Speaking in an interview with ITAR-TASS on Thursday, 
Chernichenko said that "not crimes have been forgiven but 
concrete people. Therefore the only goal of that amnesty was to 
cross out the October tragedy and free their allies." 
  He believes that the decision on political amnesty has put 
the country before the danger of new conflicts -- "They have 
released into the streets of Moscow the people who are 
professionals in staging coups. To hope that they will change 
for the better would be as silly as to wait for a self-respected 
wolf to become a vegetarian." 
  The euphoria of democrats over the adoption of the new 
Constitution was premature. He said the saying "he cried at the 
wedding but danced at the funeral" perfectly fits the deputies 
who voted for the amnesty. Chernichenko explained the political 
failure by the disintegration of democrats. 
  It took them several days to decide their position. They 
voiced their assessment of the State Duma's resolution on 
amnesty only on March 2 by saying that the amnesty was a well 
thought-out political provocation, a frontal offensive against 
democracy, the ultimate goal of which is to bring 
revenge-seeking forces to power.

<F P=106> [Sergey Parkhomenko report under the "Security" rubric: </F>
"President Expects To Profit From Combating Crime"] 
  [Text] Judging from an INTERFAX report, the scanty 
audience of observers was greatly impressed by "the harsh tone" 
in which Boris Yeltsin hurled yet another package of 
condemnations and warnings at the organizers of two coups who 
suddenly sneaked away from custody. "If those who have been 
amnestied by the State Duma decision start any activity 
jeopardizing the Russian state's security, they will be arrested 
again in accordance with law," the president said. 
  Meanwhile, a high-ranking official at the Security Council 
staff was utterly pessimistic in his comments on the news agency 
reports: "The time is wrong, the form is wrong, and the effect 
is also wrong..." Many staffers at the Security Council head 
office on Ilinka Street are presently convinced that the 
presidential advisers' key mistake was that they did not try to 
draw on the authority of the Security Council, which "has not 
yet been squandered on petty political showdowns and bickering," 
to settle the amnesty scandal. Speaking to your SEGODNYA 
correspondent, a chief of the Security Council staff noted: "If 
the amnesty-related problems were discussed not at the meeting 
chaired by Kryzhakov, but at a Security Council meeting, which 
State Duma representatives could well have been invited to join, 
the matter could just have ended in a pacifying statement." 
  Moreover, in the immediate vicinity from the Kremlin they 
have even been discussing a theory (which, as a matter of fact, 
appears fairly trustworthy) whereby as early as one week before 
the scandalous voting at the State Duma took place, Boris 
Yeltsin received clear signals from the Security Council to the 
effect that the potential political damage from the amnesty 
could be minimized only if the president were decisively to 
regain the initiative by granting a pardon himself. It is 
doubtful, however, that any of the Security Council chiefs would 
presently like to confirm the reports. The only reaction they 
might have drawn would have been irritated remarks about "that 
die-hard conservative, Lobov, who is always putting his foot in 
it..." 
  Be that as it may, the Security Council sees the amnesty 
story as a thing of the past. This is why yesterday's agenda 
did not say a single word about it. Instead, it focused on the 
discussion of the "Russian Federation Federal Program To Step Up 
the Struggle against Crime." 
  According to reports from the Security Council staff, the 
nearly 90-page document was undergoing the third reading in six 
months. The document's authors, however, pointed out from the 
outset that the implementation and, most important, the 
financing of the extremely costly project would be impossible 
without a political decision made at the top federal level. In 
accordance with a resolution adopted by the Security Council 
yesterday, the program must be submitted to the president for 
definite approval within one week. 
  The two-year program, in its current form, is estimated to 
cost slightly more than 4.8 trillion rubles (including around 2 
trillion for 1994). The Security Council was careful to 
emphasize, however, that these figures should be treated only as 
preliminary estimates: the program is yet to pass a final expert 
appraisal in the government. Given that the first, "liberal" 
version of the program was estimated at nearly 15 trillion 
rubles (it has thus been trimmed by two-thirds within the past 
six months), further cuts in the proposed subsidies appear 
fairly likely. 
  Citing estimates made according to UN methods, the authors 
claim that all this money should be seen as "investment in a 
profitable industry," because in two years' time it promises a 
nearly two-fold yield.

<F P=106> [Article by Konstantin Borovoy, chairman of the Economic </F>
Freedom Party: "Boris Yeltsin Is the Main Cause of Stagnation 
in the Russian Economy" -- from page 1 of the weekly DELOVAYA 
SREDA supplement, No. 9] 
  [Text] Today I am worried the most by the stagnation 
situation in which we have found ourselves. Or rather a 
situation which we have brought on ourselves by granting 
President Yeltsin such unlimited powers. The citizens have 
ceded him these powers not for his fine looks but to enable him 
to conduct transformations in society, the national economy and 
politics, taking counsel with representatives of democratic 
parties. 
  Having received this power, however, Yeltsin immediately 
stopped in his tracks because he thereby accomplished his 
objective. 
  At present there are all the makings of stagnation in 
evidence. Even the president's recent ailment, in my view, also 
belongs here, not to mention, for instance, such a decision of 
his as a proposal to postpone elections of administration heads 
till 1996. What is this if not an attempt to freeze the 
situation? Stagnation is precisely a situation being frozen. 
In contrast to democracy, where all ailments are exposed and 
treated. 
  Under democracy, officials who, say, have committed crimes 
are immediately dismissed and the president or any other head of 
government is obligated to do this because he depends on those 
who have voted for him, on public opinion, and finally on the 
mass media. 
  Boris Yeltsin, however, does not depend on anyone at 
present. 
His dependence even on the State Duma can be defined as very 
insignificant. What is the point of the president's meeting 
with democratic party leaders and proving to them that he is 
conducting democratic transformations in the economy and 
politics? There is absolutely no need for him to do this 
because the entire power is concentrated in his hands. 
  This situation is terrible and all that one can rely on now 
is the president's conscience. Otherwise the consequences of, 
let us say, the situation being preserved or of one-man rule 
emerging can be rather explosive. Stagnation can well lead to 
popular unrest and various actions by political parties. 
  That Yeltsin is not changing but preserving an extremely 
hard- line cabinet of ministers which was imposed on him, 
incapable and unwilling to undertake reform, is probably the 
most shining sign of stagnation. If we talk of economic 
transformations in Russia, what on earth does Chernomyrdin or 
Zaveryukha have to do with this?! All that they and people like 
them can do is to turn Russian into a Ukraine. This is very 
dangerous indeed. 
  A way to resolve our economic problems lies in raising 
economic effectiveness, creating normal jobs, the abandonment of 
economic regulation by the state, and stopping subsidies to 
unprofitable and unwanted enterprises whose needs are growing in 
proportion to what is being handed out to them all the time. 
This is a typical pattern of addiction: If six cubic 
millimeters is given to a drug addict who is accustomed to two 
cu mm a day, soon two will not be enough. 
  Economic problems can be resolved only by liberalizing the 
economy and promoting unrestrained competition. Unfortunately, 
at present the economy is dominated by the parasitic interests 
of groups whose representatives are in the government. 
Moreover, the most incapable representatives of these groups 
are in the government. 
  I will start to support Yeltsin only when there is no 
Chernomyrdin in the government and when there is a reformer at 
its head. Everything else is empty talk about the need for an 
efficient economy, advancement, and so forth. 
  Today I am giving much thought to how Yeltsin will go down 
in 
history, how posterity will appraise the present time; and I am 
almost convinced that he will not be called a reformer. His 
time will be seen as the time of struggle by reformers whom 
Yeltsin first supported, then opposed. 
  True, the president has two years in reserve, but the way he 
has begun to use his remaining tenure shows that my assessment 
of him can yet become even more sharply negative.

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Fedorov report: "Reorganization of the Security </F>
Council. The President Is Looking for a Fulcrum"] 
  [Text] The role of the Security Council may increase 
substantially in the near future. Observers do not rule out 
that this year already this consultative presidential body may 
rank next to the government and parliament or in some respects 
even rise above them. That the Security Council is preparing 
for a new role can be seen from the purge under way there: a 
special commission is studying cases of leaks, as a result of 
which the security regime will obviously be tightened. 
Yesterday, meanwhile, the reorganization of the council 
apparatus began. 
  The reorganization itself is a purely apparatus action aimed 
at limiting the independence of the numerous interdepartmental 
commissions. To this end the Security Council sectors that 
ensure its activity are to be placed under the control of Oleg 
Lobov's deputies. One of the three deputies -- General Valeriy 
Manilov, responsible for preparing council sessions -- will 
apparently become first deputy. Reshuffles in the apparatus 
deck appear routine only at first sight: This is the Security 
Council's fifth reorganization over the relatively short time of 
its existence. Everything depends on who will decide to use the 
apparatus, how, and for what purpose. 
  According to information in possession of KOMMERSANT-DAILY, 
Security Council secretary Oleg Lobov, who has failed to 
overpower the inveterate economic manager within himself, 
although he has been close to Boris Yeltsin ever since the 
Sverdlovsk days, will apparently leave his post and go on a 
prolonged business trip abroad. According to one version, he 
will replace Ivan Silayev as Russia's representative to the EC. 
  Yuriy Baturin, the president's national security adviser, is 
tipped to be the next Security Council secretary. His confusion 
in the amnesty situation may have diminished his chances in the 
public eye. Yet the main criterion for Boris Yeltsin is 
personal loyalty, and judging by Mr. Baturin's breathtaking 
career, everything is quite all right here. 
  Naturally the new Security Council secretary will need some 
time to establish contacts with the power ministries. But 
having asserted himself in this post, Mr. Baturin will head an 
organization more structured than before, cleared of people 
responsible for information leaks, and permeating practically 
all spheres of the country's life -- from protecting the 
population's health to defense and security. 
  Given that the government, which cannot be called 
pro-presidential by any stretch, is headed by Viktor 
Chernomyrdin -- a man capable of independent moves -- while in 
parliament the president's supporters are in the minority, it 
becomes clear that Boris Yeltsin urgently needs a structure he 
can lean on. 
  A renewed Security Council appears to be the best support 
with whose assistance Boris Yeltsin can regain his slipping 
grasp on power without any anti-constitutional moves. Under 
certain circumstances (it is enough to recall Vladimir 
Shumeyko's recent slip of the tongue about the need to introduce 
a state of emergency to fight crime) the Security Council can be 
placed above the government and parliament as a body 
coordinating the activity of all branches of power for the sake 
of national security interests.

for Russia today. For its sake every politician, social figure, 
and citizen must renounce personal ambitions and claims to power 
at any price and moderate his arrogance, which is a sin of 
destructive force. It is necessary once and for all to renounce 
the view that in our society there are two hostile camps, the 
righteous and the unworthy. We have all been affected 
differently by defects and shortcomings and we have only one 
salvation -- justice and obedience to the law. It is that 
striving which will provide the opportunity to convincingly and 
fully reveal the character of a great nation -- determination, 
energy, will, and morality -- because the exalted character of 
each of us means the exaltation of society and the quality of a 
great power. That is why we need civil peace. 
  The people of Russia have always been great in their 
sober-mindedness and mercy. Hatred of one another and revenge 
for innocently shed blood can have no place in our society 
today, much less in the future. Without national reconciliation 
the country cannot overcome the economic, political, and social 
chaos. Without civil peace, creation and a decent life are 
impossible. 
  Last fall all who were in the House of the Soviets and on 
the 
barricades performed their civic and patriotic duty to the end 
in defense of the new-born parliamentarism, democracy, and the 
Constitution. Many of them paid the ultimate price -- their 
life -- trying to save the honor and dignity of the Russian 
state and prevent the country's slide into dictatorship. They 
died victorious and their names have gone down forever in the 
motherland's history. I grieve deeply for the dead and the 
maimed who were at the center of the bloody events. I am sure 
that the fatherland will never forget the steadfastness and 
courage of the selfless and cruelly slandered defenders of 
Russian democracy. For my part I shall do everything in my 
power to perpetuate the shining memory of those who died. 
  This terrible and tragic time has shown that it is 
impossible 
to transgress the state's fundamental law in order to hold on to 
personal power without dire consequences for the people and the 
whole country. 
  I have always consistently supported the observance of the 
rule of law and I shall solemnly adhere to that principle in the 
future too. There can be nothing higher than the law, and the 
law itself and right must never be replaced by might. The 
country and its citizens must have the opportunity to determine 
their system and conditions of life themselves and improve the 
laws by legal means. I cherish the words of the great Russian 
philosopher Ivan Ilin, who said that "a legal system which 
denies that opportunity to all or to the broad strata of the 
people by denying them access to the law is preparing an 
inevitable revolution for itself." 
  I submit to the laws of my country and the will of the 
people's representatives, who adopted the wise decision that is 
so necessary to us all today -- the "Memorandum of Accord" and 
the amnesty decree. I fully share the provisions of that 
document and will devote all my efforts to preventing enmity and 
discord. I agree that each of us must find the inner strength 
to acknowledge his own mistakes and respond to parliament's good 
will with a readiness to unite our efforts for the well-being of 
the long-suffering people and to find a way out of the prolonged 
crisis as soon as possible. 
  I consider it my moral duty to state to those irresponsible 
blabbermouths and dishonorable politicians and journalists who 
have mounted a shameful and obscene campaign through the mass 
media, indulging in hysterics and distorting the essence of what 
happened in September-October 1993: Stop this besmirching of 
innocent people, exploiting the dead, pinning the blame on 
others as if theyr were the true culprits in the tragedy, 
intimidating society with talk of civil war, and attributing to 
me comments aimed at destabilizing the situation in the country. 
Think before you inflame hysteria! Is the blood that has been 
shed really not enough for you? 
  I appeal to a great people and I call all Russians to civil 
peace, accord, and creative work.

  [Text] Moscow March 4 TASS -- Federation Council speaker 
Vladimir Shumeyko has suggested holding a national congress with 
a view to working out a concept of national concord. 
  Speaking at an enlarged meeting of the Russian Government in 
the Kremlin on Friday [4 March], Shumeyko said "society is no 
longer held together by nation-wide interests. It gets 
increasingly differentiated", which exacerbates the crisis in 
the country. 
  Shumeyko believes that many a law is not enacted at the 
local 
level, "the farther from Moscow, the lesser the enactment." 
This is caused by the lack of nation-wide interests, which 
leads to the discreditation of authority, he said. 
  Emphasising the importance of strengthening authority in the 
country and restoring order, Shumeyko said the fashioning of a 
concept of national concord will invigorate authority and 
contribute to taking the country out of the crisis. 
  The Federation Council chief is of the opinion that the 
government now is not in a position to adhere to nation-wide 
interests because it is being pressured by various lobbyist 
groups.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Kudakayev report in the "Appointment" column: </F>
"The New Counterintelligence Chief Will Fight the Mafia"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation president's press service 
has reported the appointment of Sergey Stepashin, 42, as 
director of the Russian Federation Federal Counterintelligence 
Service [FCS]. Earlier, until Nikolay Golushko's resignation 
this week, Stepashin had held the post of FCS first deputy 
director. Informed sources say that there were also other 
candidates for the post of new director. But, the sources said, 
the other aspirants "have opted out." 
  The FCS press service issued a brief statement by the new 
FCS 
chief. Among his department's priorities he mentioned work "to 
expose, prevent, and curb intelligence-subversive activity by 
foreign special services and organizations, and illegal 
encroachments on Russia's constitutional system, sovereignty, 
territorial integrity, and defense capability." Sergey 
Stepashin is convinced that the Russian president needs "strong 
and effective special services." 
  According to Mr. Stepashin, there are plans to hold an 
all-Russian conference of territorial counterintelligence chiefs 
in March which will consider concrete measures and define 
optimal forms of FCS activity. In an interview with INTERFAX he 
said that yesterday's Russian Federation Security Council 
session, which examined the federal program to fight organized 
crime in 1994-1995, specified the FCS' tasks in the area of 
combating corruption, including in the upper echelons of power. 
Therefore this Russian special service has retained the 
functions of countering criminals inside the country, which 
earlier belonged to the ministry, without confining itself only 
to fighting the external threat. At least for the time being 
there are no plans for another reorganization of the FCS. 

<H5>    Stepashin, Sergey Vadimovich </H5>
  Was born on 2 March 1952 in the city of Port Arthur (PRC). 
In 1973 he graduated from the USSR Internal Affairs Ministry's 
Higher Political School, and in 1981 from the V.I. Lenin 
Military Political Academy. Candidate of history (he defended 
his dissertation in 1986; subject: "Party Direction of Fire 
Fighting Formations." 
  In 1990 he was deputy chief of the political history 
department at the USSR Internal Affairs Ministry's Higher 
Political School (Leningrad). From 1990 to 1993, people's 
deputy of the Russian Federation (member of the Left Center -- 
Cooperation faction and the Army Reform group). From 1991 to 
1993, chairman of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet's 
Defense and Security Committee. 
  In 1992, Russian Federation deputy security minister. In 
1993, first deputy security minister of the Russian Federation; 
in 1993-1994, FCS first deputy director. He quit the CPSU on 19 
August 1991. Lieutenant-general.

  [Text] Moscow, 3 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- Rumors which have 
appeared lately in some media sources, to the effect that the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service is going to be reorganized 
again, have nothing to do with reality, an informant close to 
the Russian president's administration told an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent today. 
  He expressed his concern over the fact that, in conditions 
when a campaign has been unleashed in the United States around 
the Ames affair, the publishing of such reports serves in the 
final analysis the unseemly purpose of misleading the public, 
exerting a psychological pressure on the staff of 
counterintelligence bodies, and paralyzing their activities.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1725 GMT on 2 March 1994 broadcasts a report from the 
"Details" program presented by Nikolay Svanidze, which deals 
with the economy. He says the miners stopped their strike 
yesterday. Tomorrow, at the Presidium of the Council of 
Ministers, the Russian State Budget for the current year is to 
be approved. Then it will be sent for ratification by the State 
Duma. These two events are linked together. The miners are 
waiting to see what the budget will do for them. 
  State Duma Deputy Yegor Gaydar is interviewed by Svanidze. 
He speaks of the problem of non-payment of wages. He says that 
the higher the non-payments, the greater the expectation that 
the government will pay. 
  Economy Minister Aleksandr Shokhin says one should not make 
promises one cannot keep, but promises that are now on a par 
with obligations should be kept. 
  Gaydar says the workers are, after all, also suppliers -- 
suppliers of labor. They have fulfilled their obligations and 
they should be paid. The management of the enterprises have not 
fulfilled theirs. The miners are not people who are holding a 
knife at the throat of the government to press for an increase 
in pay. They are asking reasonable questions -- about the need 
to investigate the effectiveness of the use of funds for 
subsidizing the coal industry, they are asking to what extent 
these funds are going to maintain the commercial structures 
being set up in the corporations. 
  "Are they sitting in high-interest accounts and the deposits 
of joint enterprises?" they are asking, Gaydar says. Svanidze 
asks how much is being stolen, and Gaydar says much is being 
stolen. 
  Shokhin says the government should explain what policy it is 
pursuing and the limited resources of the budget should be 
targetted very accurately. He says that if we provide enough 
funds for the coal industry we should ensure continued work 
without the stoppages we have had of late. 
  Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin, interviewed in an office, 
says, leafing through a book: "Our proposals are very tough. 
This document is the draft budget, which is to be examined by 
the Government presidium tomorrow." 
  "We must finance ourselves from a relatively safe point of 
view as regards inflation," Dubinin says. "We are convinced 
that the pursuance of such a budget will enable us to lower the 
inflation index to the level of, at any rate less that 10 
percent a month at the end of the year." 
  Asked whether 3 or 5 is out of the question, Dubinin says 
why 
not, if we can collect more taxes than we have been counting on 
-- we do not collect anything like 100 percent and America 
collects 80 percent -- then we will be able to lower the budget 
deficit and count on lowering inflation. 
  If we were using shock therapy we could reduce inflation in 
two or three months, but it is a question of socioeconomic 
choice. We are not prepared to try the shock option. Finally, 
Dubinin says he can recommend the budget to the government. 
  In this "Details" program dealing with the economy, the 
announcer Nikolay Svanidze, says: "Incidentally, about the 
budget -- `Details' has information that the military budget, 
which is being proposed, has been received at the Ministry of 
Defense as being below par. Grachev has stated that in order to 
stick to it he will have to dismiss about 400,000 servicemen. 
He, Grachev, can take that step but does not vouch for the 
consequences."

  [Text] The Russian Government is not intending to cancel 
servicemen's benefits. The Finance Ministry's proposal that 
budgetary allocations for the requirements of the military 
department be reduced is an attempt to stir up the country and 
make the Government quarrel with the Army. According to RIA, 
this was stated today by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. He 
said it had been a matter of a private initiative on the part of 
the Finance Ministry. However, the prime minister noted, the 
Finance Ministry does not itself decide anything. The prime 
minister gave the assurance that the financing of the Defense 
Ministry this year will remain at last year's level. 
  As reported previously, the letter containing the Finance 
Ministry's proposals about reducing the benefits of servicemen, 
officers, generals, and military pensioners, which was sent to 
the Defense Ministry, evoked sharp dissatisfaction.

  [Text] Moscow March 3 TASS -- Russian State Duma Chairman 
Ivan Rybkin said the house has no "intentions to manage and 
command the press." 
  Speaking at a meeting with editors-in-chief of leading 
Russian periodicals in Moscow on Thursday [3 March], Rybkin said 
the state Duma will support the mass media and free it from "the 
pressure of strict economic censorship." 
  He suggested setting up a working group to draw up a draft 
law on the operation of mass media in 1994-1995. Rybkin 
believes the group should include Pavel Gusev, editor-in-chief 
of MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, Igor Golembiovsky, editor-in-chief of 
IZVESTIYA, Shod Muladzhanov and representatives of news agencies 
and television and radio companies. 
  The participants in the meeting blamed the current 
difficulties on the monopoly of the Ministry of Communications 
and the impossibility for the employees of publishing houses to 
privatise their enterprises. 
  Gusev, who is also chairman of the Moscow Union of 
Journalists, called for urgent changes in the system of state 
financing of publications and creation of equal conditions for 
their survival. 
  Rybkin said the draft law on mass media in 1994-1995 which 
should help the press pull through the current crisis is 
expected to be discussed by the State Duma at the end of April.

<F P=106> [Interview with S.N. Yushenkov, chairman of the State Duma </F>
Committee for Defense, by unidentified correspondent; place and 
date not given; from the "Aty-Baty" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Your committee is composed of 
representatives from various factions; do you think that you 
will be successful in coming to positive decisions with such a 
mix? 
  [Yushenkov] We all have one aim -- legislative support of 
reliable Russian defense. In this sense, I think that by 
building on reality and Russian practices and traditions we will 
be able to work out mutually acceptable decisions. 
  We must realistically address the situation which has 
developed. The situation is such that troops, the army in 
general, [pauses, changes thought] many army units are stationed 
outside the borders of the Russian Federation and are 
participating in such things as peacekeeping duties. Whether I, 
or others, like it or not, it is a fact. Servicemen serving 
abroad need legislation to feel that they are really protected 
in the social and legal sense. 
  [Correspondent] Will you comment on the work of the 
commission appointed to investigate the events of 3-4 October, 
1993. 
  [Yushenkov] As a former member of a similar commission 
appointed to investigate the events of 19-21 August, I remember 
its activities well. Regardless of the fact the Supreme Soviet 
in the past had more authority and opportunity than the present 
State Duma, the decisions of that commission did not have any 
significant influence on the processes going on in society. In 
fact, they did not avert the repeat of the putsch. I am coming 
to believe that these types of commissions -- when there is an 
investigation and the State Duma has no clearly prescribed role 
in the investigation -- cannot undertake, adopt, or in any way 
influence what happens in society. 
  [Correspondent] Sergey Nikolayevich, the former Supreme 
Soviet and old committees, such as the one you served on, 
adopted quite a number of good laws in principle. Officers are 
still writing to us about the law on the status of servicemen, 
in particular, but the problem lies in the fact that these 
rather good laws are not being implemented. 
  [Yushenkov] If they are not being implemented that means 
they are not very good. There are two reasons why laws do not 
work: Either they do not conform to the existing realities in 
society -- the real state of affairs -- or they lack a mechanism 
for their implementation. We have already started a careful 
inventory of all ineffectual laws, separate clauses, and 
statutes to determine the reason why such regulations do not 
work. We will strive to either abolish the regulation, make it 
conform to reality, or structure a mechanism for its 
implementation. 
  [Correspondent] I understand. 
  [Yushenkov] The issue which you raised earlier even now has 
great significance, the essence of which is that we need to 
clearly define the type of army we want to build.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Udachin report: "We Will Go to The Polls 12 June"] </F>
  [Text] Krasnodar -- The Krasnodar Kray Administration, in 
view of an explanation from the Central Electoral Commission on 
the possibility of holding simultaneous elections to the kray 
legislative assembly and organs of local self-government, has 
decided to hold these elections on the same day, scheduling them 
for 12 June. 
  There has been a mixed reaction among the Kuban public to 
the 
transfer of the legislative assembly elections from 3 April to 
12 June. The kray organization of the "25 April Alliance" party 
is inclined to see in this some kind of behind-the-scenes games 
by the Kray Administration and a desire on its part to forestall 
political opponents in a bid to get its own people into the 
representative organs of power. The kray organization of the 
Agrarian Party of Russia expects 12 June to be the final date 
for the elections, and intends to hold visiting sessions in a 
number of rayons where it intends to define strategy and tactics 
for the election campaign. 
  The local organization of the Republican Party believes that 
the postponement of the elections will open the way for 
conducting the election campaign without haste. For the 
elections, the "Republicans" have decided to register as the 
"Yabloko" sociopolitical association, which, apart from them, 
will include the Association for the Defense of Consumer Rights, 
"Memorial," the Association of Repressed Peoples, the 
"Entrepreneurs for a New Russia" Association, and "Solidarity," 
the Kuban association of shareholders. Mikhail Veligodksiy, 
chairman of the Republican Party kray organization, believes 
that the Kray Administration made a mistake by inserting into 
the statute on elections an amendment on the need to collect 3 
percent of signatures in order to nominate a candidate in a 
district. This is three times as many as under the old version. 
The task of collecting 2,000-3,000 signatures in today's 
conditions is highly complex. But the elections are set, and, 
one way or another, the candidate deputies for the kray 
legislative assembly must submit voters' signatures in support 
of them before the electoral commission will register them.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report from "SIBIRYAKI" newspaper feature] </F>
  [Text] The Buryat Supreme Soviet has unanimously adopted 
the republic's new Constitution by a roll-call vote. 
  According to the provisions of the Fundamental Law Buryatia 
is henceforth a sovereign democratic rule-of-law state within 
the Russian Federation. And the relations of its organs of 
power with the federal authorities are built on a 
constitutional-treaty basis. The new system for Buryatia's 
state structure provides for the post of president, who is the 
head of the republic and its executive power, and also for the 
existence of a parliament -- the People's Khural -- as a 
representative and legislative organ. 
  Before elections to the new organs of power in accordance 
with transitional provisions the powers of the republic's 
existing Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers are retained.

<F P=106> [Tatyana Borisevich report: "Republic of Komi Constitution: </F>
Soviets Remain"] 
  [Text] The Republic of Komi has adopted a new Constitution. 
Unlike the Russian Constitution, the Republic of Komi's 
Constitution was adopted not by referendum but at a session of 
the Supreme Soviet. The republic is remaining Soviet because 
the legislative organ will be called the State Soviet. The 
Constitution introduces a new concept -- the "head of the 
republic" ["glava respubliki"]. The drafters of the 
Constitution rejected the term "president" in the belief that 
there should be only one president in Russia. Furthermore, in 
the referendum the republic's population indirectly opposed the 
post of president. The new Komi Constitution envisages private 
ownership of land and a state guarantee of free medical aid and 
proclaims two state languages on the republic's territory -- 
Komi and Russian.

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Solomenko report: "Chairman of Russian Party's </F>
St. Petersburg Branch Detained on Suspicion of Murder"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg -- Staffers from the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service's St. Petersburg Administration 
Service for Combating Terrorism, in conjunction with officials 
from the Criminal Investigation Department, have arrested four 
residents of St. Petersburg including Nikolay Bondarik, chairman 
of the St. Petersburg branch of the Russian Party, who is 
running for election to the City Assembly from the "Great 
Russia" bloc. The detainees are suspected of premeditated 
murder. 
  All four are members of the Russian Party. Firearms were 
discovered at their homes and workplaces, and these have been 
confiscated. 
  Nikolay Bondarik is an advocate of Hitlerite ideas. He 
stated: "The global task facing the Russian Party is to create a 
single racial area from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.... 
Why not set up...reservations for the Yakuts and the Uzbeks? 
Likewise, a national park for Jews will be set up in 
Birobidzhan, where our children will go for days out, to have a 
look." 
  This scandalous piece of news may have a noticeable impact 
on 
the disposition of political forces in St. Petersburg on the eve 
of the elections to its City Assembly. How will the "Great 
Russia" bloc (which comprises the St. Petersburg branches of the 
Russian Party, the Russian National Alliance, and the Russian 
National Assembly) behave now? How will the Russian Party 
itself react to what has happened? For now, its supporters 
intend to picket the building of the St. Petersburg Main 
Internal Affairs Administration.

  [Text] The wave of strikes has now arrived in the always 
calm and patient Kursk Oblast. Vadim Simonenko reports. 
  [Simonenko] I am holding in my hand a copy of the protocol 
issued by a joint sitting of the trade union and the council of 
the collective of Kursk AES [nuclear electric power station]. 
There is only one issue on the agenda -- the financial and 
economic state of emergency at Kursk AES. The power station has 
failed to receive over 85 billion rubles for electricity already 
supplied to customers. 
  Because of the shortage of money it has become impossible to 
ensure the normal technological process and safety procedures. 
The collective of the AES has not been receiving its wages 
since December 1993, and the staff of the directorate for the 
construction of Kursk AES has had no money since November 1993. 
The situation is seen as being on the verge of a social 
explosion. 
  The collective of the AES has demanded that money collected 
by the Russian Federation Government from customers should be 
remitted and the wages for December, January, and February be 
paid. If these demands are not fulfilled it has been decided 
that the collective of the AES will be called upon to stage a 
hunger strike, and the elections to the oblast duma should be 
boycotted. However, the main thing here is that the workforce 
is prepared to cut the output of the AES generating sets to a 
level which only satisfies the needs of the town of Kurchatov, 
where the staff and the builders of the AES live. They are also 
prepared to eventually disconnect the electricity supply line. 
The inhabitants of Kursk are very worried with the state of 
affairs at the AES, since the distance from the power station to 
the oblast center is only around 30 kms.

<F P=106> [Report by Maria Starozhitskaya of UNIAN specially for </F>
IZVESTIYA, under "Events and Comments" rubric: "Ukrainian 
President Flies Off to United States Offended at His 
Compatriots"] 
  [Text] Kiev -- In his last appearance on television before 
his visit to the United States, Leonid Kravchuk clearly 
explained to the electorate the reasons why he has decided not 
to participate in the presidential elections scheduled for 26 
June. 
  From what he said, because of the great probability of a 
second or even third round of parliamentary elections and the 
unformed state of the government, even if he does participate in 
the elections, anarchy is inevitable. "I have been driven into 
a corner: I have either to throw everything away and enter the 
elections, or display responsibility and not take this step," he 
said. "There is also another moral aspect. Like all of us, at 
school and after school I studied the lives of other presidents, 
but I have never come across such sordid, uncultured, and overt 
campaign of persecution of a head of state as many people both 
inside and outside parliament, as well as in the Ukrainian mass 
media, are taking the liberty of conducting. It is a historic 
phenomenon for such a boorish attitude toward the first 
president to become established in the consciousness of 
generations: In human terms I cannot and do not want to 
understand it." 
  The first wave of impartial comments about the president's 
step -- from "Has Kravchuk Gotten Cold Feet?" to "The Main Thing 
Is Getting Out at the Right Time" (I cite the republic press 
headlines) -- has already poured forth. Socialist Party chief 
Aleksandr Moroz deemed Kravchuk's decision politically correct 
-- inasmuch as, according to him, the president has practically 
no chance of success at the elections. Rukh leader Vyacheslav 
Chornovil has described Kravchuk's step as a tactical one aimed 
at disrupting the presidential elections for the sake of 
prolonging his own powers. 
  "I don't know why the president's nerve has failed him: Even 
if he was not thinking of running, he should have announced this 
a month or two before the elections, and not now, on the eve of 
his trip to the United States. How will he speak with Clinton?" 
-- the question posed by Democratic Party chief Vladimir 
Yavorivskiy remains rhetorical at the moment. 
  However, the possibility of an imminent change of head of 
state was not envisaged during preparations for Kravchuk's 3-7 
March visit to the United States. At an advance meeting with 
the Ukrainian diaspora, Bill Clinton said that the program of 
the visit should be put together in such a way as to promote the 
strengthening of Kravchuk's prestige at home to the maximum 
degree. 
  "Whereas before the United States was only interested in the 
withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, now it is also 
interested in full-scale cooperation and aid in the face of the 
economic crisis," Anton Buteyko, the Ukrainian president's 
adviser on international questions, said. Therefore, the main 
aim of the present visit is specifically to move relations 
between our countries to a new level and to sign agreements on 
investment, trade, and economic relations, cooperation in the 
sphere of conversion and space research, and on a specific 
mechanism for granting disarmament assistance. Ukraine and the 
United States can and should develop their ties independently of 
relations with Russia. 
  However desirable it may be not to depend on these 
relations, 
such attention to Ukraine on the part of a Bill Clinton who just 
two months ago did not want to visit Kiev can be explained by 
the good intentions of obtaining a strong, peaceful, and 
obedient Ukraine as a counterbalance to the unstable and 
unpredictable Russia -- especially after the amnesty and the 
hijacking of the U.S. initiative in settling the Bosnian 
conflict. 
  As for the Ukrainian president, the problem of the Treaty on 
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which remains unsigned 
by Ukraine, will inevitably arise during his visit to the United 
States -- the last session of the present parliament is already 
over, while the new elections are being called into question, as 
Kravchuk has already convinced us. Perhaps the only thing that 
remains for the president to do in the United States is to 
declare himself the guarantor of the implementation of earlier 
promises -- inasmuch as during the above-described period of 
autocracy in Ukraine (roughly April-June) it will be possible 
both to sign the treaty and start the removal of weapons in 
accordance with the agreed plan for reducing offensive 
armaments. Then it will be possible not to renounce 
participation in the presidential elections -- the voice of Bill 
Clinton, who has taken the Ukrainian citizens' fancy, will be 
able to decide their outcome. Particularly since the reciprocal 
sympathy of the U.S. president is backed up in material terms: 
The most significant result of Kravchuk's visit will be credits 
and payments to Ukraine by the IMF and the World Bank.

<F P=106> [Report by Anatoliy Tabachenko] </F>
  [Excerpts] On 3 March at 1600, an airplane with a 
Ukrainian delegation on board landed at Andrews Air Force Base 
in the vicinity of the U.S. capital. The Ukrainian president 
was met by U.S. officials, Ukrainian Ambassador to the United 
States Oleh Bilorus, and representatives of the Ukrainian 
Diaspora. Later, special helicopters transported the Ukrainian 
delegation to a square near the White House, from where they 
went on to Blair House. [passage omitted] 
  In accordance with the program for the first day of the 
visit, the Ukrainian president met with Senators Paul Simon and 
Harris (Owford). During a conversation with representatives of 
the legislative branch, Leonid Kravchuk put particular emphasis 
on the complex issues that Ukraine is facing currently and 
outlined ways for further development of cooperation between our 
countries. In the evening, an official reception was held at 
the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, on the occasion of the 
official visit to the United States by President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  On 4 March, a meeting between Leonid Kravchuk and Bill 
Clinton is planned. It is expected that a package of important 
documents will be signed, which will introduce a new path in 
strengthening economic and political relations between Ukraine 
and the United States. The political willingness of the leaders 
of both countries' to extend our experience from cooperation in 
the military-political sphere to economic, trade, and 
scientific-technical cooperation, is a positive sign of the 
current status of U.S.-Ukrainian relations. The legal basis for 
this cooperation is to be established by appropriate interstate 
agreements.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Borisenko] </F>
  [Text] Washington March 4 TASS -- President Leonid Kravchuk 
of Ukraine arrived here on Thursday for an official visit. He 
plans to have meetings with President Bill Clinton, Vice 
President Albert Gore, the secretaries of defence, the treasury 
and commerce, congressional leaders, the management of the World 
Bank and the International Monetary Fund and members of the 
business community. 
  A treaty between Ukraine and the United States on the 
encouragement and mutual protection of investments and a 
convention between the governments of the two countries on the 
prevention of double taxation and of tax evasions on income and 
capital taxes are to be signed during the visit. 
  The two governments are also to sign an agreement on 
cooperation in science and technology and the Defence Ministries 
will sign an agreement on additional assistance in eliminating 
strategic nuclear weapons and preventing the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction. 
  A wide range of matters of mutual interest are expected to 
be 
discussed, a State Department spokesman who requested anonymity 
told ITAR-TASS. He did not rule out the possibility that 
regional security issues as well as Ukrainian-Russian relations 
would be discussed during the visit. 
  "The principal aim of the visit is to broaden U.S.-Ukrainian 
economic and trade contacts," Dmitriy Markov, counsellor at the 
Ukrainian Embassy in the U.S., told ITAR-TASS. "We are also 
interested in discussing defence conversion matters with the 
U.S. side," he added. 
  President Kravchuk and members of the American business 
community will discuss possibilities for capital investments in 
the Ukrainian economy, Sheila O'Creal, spokeswoman for the 
overseas private investment corporation, told ITAR-TASS. 
  A press release circulated by the corporation in view of the 
Ukrainian president's visit points out that Ukraine is now in a 
critically important stage of transition to a market economy and 
may become an important market for Western investors.

  [Text] A high-ranking Russian military man has reported in 
an interview with INTERFAX that the withdrawal to Russia of the 
first part of the strategic missiles located on the territory of 
Ukraine is expected in the first ten days of March. According 
to him, this batch will consist of sixty military units. The 
person interviewed by the correspondent of the INTERFAX agency 
expressed satisfaction with the fact that Moscow and Kiev have 
found a political way to resolve this problem. He stressed that 
the delay in withdrawing the missiles is explained by the fact 
that the necessary documents for the withdrawal of this specific 
cargo had not been drawn up.

  [Text] The Ukrainian embassy in Moscow issued a statement 
on Friday describing as premature a report saying the first 
batch of nuclear warheads had arrived from Ukraine to be 
dismantled in Russia. The statement follows media reports from 
the past two days which quoted Ukrainian Ambassador Volodymyr 
Krzhanitskiy as saying "the first trainload of nuclear warheads 
has already arrived in Russia from Ukraine." 
  The embassy said the only thing the ambassador mentioned in 
recent interviews was that "plans are under way to transfer 
missile units for subsequent destruction in Russia." 
  The statement describes media reports about the "first 
trainload of warheads" as an attempt at rushing things.

  [Text] Russia has delivered no nuclear fuel for Ukrainian 
nuclear power stations since the time Ukraine, Russia and the 
U.S.A. signed an agreement in Moscow. First Deputy Chairman of 
the Ukrainian State Committee on Nuclear Power Nur Nigmatullin 
told Interfax-Ukraine that the document was supposed to be 
supplemented by inter-governmental agreements. "They have been 
drafted and are under discussion but the deliveries will not 
arrive until the agreements are signed," Nigmatullin explained. 
  The fuel will be supplied at a price of $600,000 to $700,000 
per fuel element for VVER-1000 reactors as compensation for 
warheads that will be sent to Russia for destruction. The 
Ukrainian nuclear power stations need 550 elements a year. 
  Nigmatullin said that the fuel supplied as compensation will 
last three to four years. "At the moment the Ukrainian nuclear 
power stations have a supply of fuel until May of June 1994," he 
added.

  [Text] Many representatives of Ukrainian and foreign mass 
media have lately been inquiring at the Cabinet of Ministers of 
Ukraine about the situation that is of interest to them, 
concerning the supply of gas to Ukraine and the export of it to 
European countries. 
  The press service of the cabinet of ministers reports that 
due to reductions in gas deliveries to Ukraine from its main 
suppliers, these matters at present are safely under the 
supervision of the government. On 2 March, in particular, it 
was decided to use gas more rationally, which would make it 
possible to reduce considerably the consumption of gas by the 
national economy. This will allow Ukraine to perform its 
obligations in a stable manner in respect of the transit of gas 
across its territory and will ensure the blue fuel is supplied 
to European countries in full. 
  The government at the same time is taking steps to resolve 
relations with gas exporters and resume its deliveries to 
Ukraine at the level determined by interstate agreements.

  [Text] Kiev, 2 Mar -- Mykola Makarevych, first deputy 
foreign minister of Ukraine, received Istvan Varga, ambassador 
extraordinary and plenipotentiary of Hungary. During a 
conversation, the Hungarian ambassador said in particular that 
the Hungarian Government does not recognize the so-called 
Ruthenian "shadow government" and regards the question of the 
recognition of Ruthenians as an independent nationality as a 
Ukrainian internal affair. The ambassador stressed that certain 
assessments and views with regard to the "Ruthenian" question 
that appear in some of Hungary's mass media do not always 
coincide with the government's position.

  [Text] Simferopol -- "From a legal point of view, the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council decree on the status of the autonomous 
Republic of Crimea does not stand up to criticism," the 
statement made by the Crimean president's press service, which 
has been circulated, says. The press service cites the legal 
findings of Pavel Yefgrafov, head of the Crimean Supreme Soviet 
State-Legal Department, which note that "in view of the internal 
discrepancy between the Ukrainian Constitution and legislation, 
it is extremely difficult to bring the Constitution and 
legislation of the Republic of Crimea into line with them." The 
press service has accused the Ukrainian Supreme Council of 
attempting to take even limited sovereignty away from the 
Republic of Crimea.

  [Text] According to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's Press 
Service, the Ukrainian military is staggered by the Crimean 
President Yuriy Meshkov's remark that Ukraine has introduced 
troops into the Crimea in violation of its legislation. In an 
earlier exclusive interview with INTERFAX, Meshkov made it clear 
that the Crimean naval forces are strong enough to defend this 
peninsula on the Black Sea. 
  As the press-service noted, "Since responsibilities for 
national defense rest with the country's president and defense 
minister and since the Crimea is, although autonomous, also an 
integral part of the Ukraine, it is exclusively within the 
competence of Ukraine's president to discuss Ukrainian troop 
withdrawal from the Crimea." 
  "Meshkov is not a military man, and therefore cannot assess 
the defense sufficiency of southern Ukraine," the press service 
noted.

<F P=106> [Report by Ihor Hrushko: "Five Questions for the President"] </F>
  [Text] Last Friday [25 Feb], speaking with journalists, 
[Ukrainian President] L. Kravchuk confirmed he would not take 
part in the June presidential elections. Because he believes 
that an extremely complicated situation may take shape, when, 
even after a second round of parliamentary elections, the 
parliament will not be plenipotentiary due to the election of an 
incomplete Supreme Council. As a result, it will not be able to 
form a government. If, at the same time, the acting head of 
state starts an election campaign and also elections to local 
organs of executive power are conducted, then a total collapse 
of power in the country may become imminent with unpredictable 
consequences. Thus, out of the two possible variants -- to 
abandon everything and proceed to presidential elections, or, 
showing responsibility for the situation in the country, not to 
do so -- L. Kravchuk opted for the latter. 
  Even though Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk] stated that 
political considerations had been the main ones in his decision, 
one should not rule out moral aspects either. "In no other 
country of the world will you hear such dirty slander, remarks 
unworthy of cultured people, and provocations with regard to the 
person of president, as I hear both within the walls of our 
parliament and outside it," said L. Kravchuk. 
  Is it possible that he will revise his decision? Even though 
the president did not give a straightforward answer, he remarked 
that the decision depends upon many factors. In particular, it 
depends on the election of a plenipotentiary parliament and the 
formation by the latter of a new government. It is also 
necessary, stressed L. Kravchuk, to determine what president 
will be elected and with what powers. Unless we do this, there 
again will be a power struggle between the legislative and 
executive power structures. In Leonid Makarovych's opinion, the 
same must be done with regard to the heads of local power 
structures. Even prior to elections, the candidates must know 
their rights and duties. For this, it is necessary to adopt a 
special law. 
  "Many of your political opponents see Ukraine's economic 
difficulties in its course toward independence and demand that 
all ties with Russia be restored and that the `Belarusian 
variant' be introduced in our country. What do you think of 
this?," a HOLOS UKRAYINY correspondent asked L. Kravchuk. 
  The restoration of all ties, believes the president, will 
mean the return to or restoration of the Soviet Union, because 
the old structure of industry will remain unchanged. Today, 
this is absurd. Even [Russian President] B. Yeltsin pointed out 
in a recent speech before parliament that Russia must produce 
everything the Russians need. The same applies to Ukraine and 
the whole of the CIS. In other words, while building states and 
new economic structures, it is necessary to create a common 
market of the CIS countries and to resolve, in a coordinated 
manner, both economic and political questions. L. Kravchuk did 
not support the idea of introducing the "Belarusian variant" in 
Ukraine. Even if Russia had agreed to introduce a ruble zone in 
our country, stressed Kravchuk, it would have demanded such 
concessions as would totally eliminate our political and 
economic independence. 
  What is the president's attitude toward the idea of 
Ukraine's 
federalization? In answering this question, L. Kravchuk pointed 
out that, historically, a unitary state took shape in our 
country. That is why, there is no sense in deliberately 
dividing it into federative lands. On the other hand, he 
stressed, Ukrainian regions must have extensive independence in 
questions of budget, administration of state property, and so 
on. Speaking about the Crimea, the president considers the 1990 
decision on granting the peninsula the status of autonomy was 
correct. 
  "If that had not been done," said L. Kravchuk, emphasizing 
that it was the first time that he had spoken so openly about 
it, "in 1990, there existed a real threat that the Supreme 
Council of the former USSR would adopt a decision on separating 
the Crimea from Ukraine. Today, the situation is different. 
Especially after signing the Tripartite Statement, in 
accordance with which both the United States and Russia made a 
commitment to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity. As 
regards relations with the present Crimean leadership, it is 
necessary, believes Leonid Makarovych, to proceed along the road 
of mutual understanding, and not confrontation. At the same 
time, he stated, any actions aimed at separating the Crimea will 
be regarded as illegal with corresponding consequences. This 
crucial political issue must be taken into account by the 
Crimean authorities. 
  At the journalists' request, the president also expressed 
his 
opinion on problems of privatization in Ukraine and our 
society's emergence from the crisis. 
  At the end of the meeting, L. Kravchuk called upon all 
citizens of Ukraine to take part in elections. In his opinion, 
we must not allow chaos to prevail. Because it is a road toward 
conflicts and confrontations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mykola Mykhalchenko, chief of the </F>
presidential service for issues of domestic policy, by Yu. 
Nepomnyashcha; place and date not given: "There Is a Problem 
With Crimea, Yet, It Is Not in Meshkov"] 
  [Text] [Nepomnyashcha] Before the Crimean elections, 
[Ukrainian President] Leonid Kravchuk said that the problem is 
not whether there will be a president, but what powers he will 
have. Today, when a month has already passed since the election 
of Yuriy Meshkov as [Crimean] president, do you think that there 
still is a problem with the Crimea? 
  [Mykhalchenko] There is a problem, but it is an objective 
one, and it does not depend on who is in power there -- [Crimean 
Supreme Council Chairman Mykola] Bahrov or Meshkov. In general, 
the problem with Crimea is not who is the leader -- the speaker 
or the president -- but what social forces are active on the 
peninsula. We see that pro-Russian forces are very active 
there. Moreover, their activities are aimed at separation from 
Ukraine. This is the problem. 
  These activities, however, are doomed to failure. Nobody in 
the world claims that the documents according to which the 
Crimea was handed over to Ukraine were illegal. The Crimea is 
an integral part of our territory. Not only Ukraine but also 
all of Europe will base its position on this fact. 
  Perhaps this position is also convenient for Russia, because 
if it acts differently, it will position itself in a very 
inconvenient situation. In such a case, Germany will have a 
reason to address the issue of East Prussia, currently 
Kaliningrad Oblast. The issue of Kuril Islands and other 
territories, which were acquired by Russia in the 20th century, 
may also be addressed more sharply. This problem is like an 
iceberg. 
  Yuriy Meshkov will undoubtedly define his strategy and 
tactics soon. Russia has been supporting him in his activities 
so far. However, when he went to Russia already as the 
president, neither the Russian president nor the prime minister, 
nor even a deputy prime minister, received him. This was very 
symptomatic. Russia understands that the Crimea is an 
autonomous body in the composition of Ukraine, and it should be 
treated as an autonomous republic. Regarding Crimea's 
cooperation with the CIS and other Western or Eastern countries, 
the Ukrainian leadership has never been against that. Such 
cooperation can be conducted directly, however, only within the 
competence available for the Crimea. The issues of foreign 
relations, borders, customs houses, and so on, fall under the 
competence of the central government. 
  [Nepomnyashcha] Yuriy Meshkov goes to Russia and, according 
to him, agrees to put the Russian ruble into circulation in the 
Crimea. Does the leader of the autonomous republic have the 
right to do that? 
  [Mykhalchenko] In this case, his wishes are presented as 
reality. First of all, at a meeting between both presidents -- 
Kravchuk and Meshkov -- when the latter addressed this issue, 
Kravchuk did not respond positively. The issue was submitted 
for consideration by a working group. Second, Russia will never 
put its ruble into circulation without approval from the central 
Ukrainian Government, because this would be a financial 
aggression. In general, even if there are two currencies in the 
Crimea, this will not be really bad for Ukraine. The 
consequences will be worse for Russia, because it will expose 
itself to the blow of inflation, opening a free path for its 
currency to sneak away. 
  [Nepomnyashcha] Who will repay the loans that the Crimean 
president wants to negotiate currently? 
  [Mykhalchenko] If the loans are granted without the central 
government's approval, Ukraine will not take any responsibility 
for them. I have recently had a conversation with an official 
of the European Bank of Cooperation, who said that his company 
will not grant the $100 million in the form of a loan for 
building hotels, etc., unless there is the approval of the Kiev 
government. If the central government acts as a guarantor of 
the loan, it will not allow it to be wasted. Those who will 
obtain any loans without Kiev's guarantees will be responsible 
for repaying them. 
  [Nepomnyashcha] In other words, these will be private 
loans... 
  [Mykhalchenko] Yes. 
  [Nepomnyashcha] Is the Ukrainian leadership going to put the 
following emphasis in its policy: The peninsula wanted to get a 
president, and it has received one. The president has promised 
a lot in his election campaign, and this means that he should 
implement this now. Thus, the responsibility of the Crimean 
authorities for living conditions must increase now? 
  [Mykhalchenko] We could follow this reasoning, particularly, 
taking into account the fact that 50 percent of the Crimean 
budget is composed of central government subsidies. We could 
say: If you do not want to cooperate with us, we will not give 
you any subsidies. I know, however, that the central government 
will never put strong pressure on the Crimea to bring it to its 
knees. We understand that the people who live there need energy 
and housing, and that local enterprises need assistance. The 
subsidies have therefore been preserved. The Crimean 
government, however, should not forget that it is able to secure 
the life of the peninsula only half way. A situation when 
subsidies are coming from the center but revenues are left home 
is inadmissible. The Crimea should also pay taxes, contribute 
to the pension fund, etc. 
  [Nepomnyashcha] How do you assess the fact that Yuriy 
Meshkov has invited Yevhen Saburov, one of Silayev's deputies in 
a former Russian Government, to assume the office of Crimean 
prime minister? 
  [Mykhalchenko] Since I personally know Saburov very well, I 
do not see any revolt here. Such a practice is known throughout 
the world. There is one judicial problem however. Ukrainian 
legislation regarding state service says that state offices can 
be held only by Ukrainian citizens. Yevhen Saburov was born in 
Yalta, and if he wanted to receive Ukrainian citizenship, there 
would be no obstacles. This would be beneficial for the Crimea, 
because he is a top level economist. 
  [Nepomnyashcha] Meshkov's viewpoint regarding the Black Sea 
Fleet is essentially different than the opinions of official 
Kiev. What will become of the fleet in such a case? 
  [Mykhalchenko] It will become what it is to become, 
regardless of Meshkov. This is not his competence, but that of 
the central Russian and Ukrainian Governments. During his 
meeting with Meshkov, Kravchuk said that although the Crimean 
government will attend the negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet, 
the decision will be made by the Ukrainian and Russian 
Governments and presidents, as provided for by agreements. The 
position of the Crimean government is purely consultative. 
  [Nepomnyashcha] Does the Crimean Constitution fall in line 
with the Ukrainian one currently? 
  [Mykhalchenko] No. In many cases it does not. I would not 
like to provide these examples, because this issue is currently 
being examined by the parliament, which will make it completely 
clear. I will only say that the Crimean Constitution must be 
brought in line with the Ukrainian one. There is no other way. 
  [Nepomnyashcha] What if there is resistance? 
  [Mykhalchenko] The power of law should be applied. The 
Ukrainian Constitution is superior with regard to the Crimean 
one, and the minority should be subordinated to the majority. 
  [Nepomnyashcha] It is easy to say that the power of law must 
be applied. What if it will be impossible to do this legally? 
  [Mykhalchenko] Other powers should be exercised then, to 
ensure that Ukrainian laws are effective. I believe, however, 
that certain reasonable circles will be found in the Crimea, 
which will understand that resistance has no future. Otherwise, 
they will have to take responsibility for the fate of the people. 
  There is another issue in the Crimea however, which is to be 
defined in both the Ukrainian and Crimean Constitutions. There 
are indigenous people in the Crimea -- the Crimean Tatars -- and 
their status should be defined in the Crimean Constitution. I 
believe that this territorial autonomy can be gradually 
transformed into nationally-territorial one, the constitution of 
which will denote that the Crimean Tatars are its indigenous 
people. Otherwise, all international organizations will see 
there violation of the rights of a native people. 
  [Nepomnyashcha] On 1 December [1991] during the referendum, 
the majority of people in Sevastopol voted in favor of Ukrainian 
independence, which Leonid Kravchuk used to emphasize. 
Recently, however, the city has voted for other ideals, having 
supported Yuriy Meshkov. 
  [Mykhalchenko] At that time, many politicians claimed that 
if Ukraine separated from Russia, we would live much better. 
And people believed in this. You probably remember how strong 
the propaganda was at that time: Everything is being carried 
away from Ukraine, and therefore, we are hungry and barefoot. 
But when we begin to live on our own, we will immediately get 
rich, our bellies will be full, and we will be well clad. 
Later, instead of conducting structural reform of the economy, 
we began our tug of war. Meanwhile, the crisis deepened, and 
living conditions declined, by the way, also in Russia. Now, 
people believe that it was better when we lived together, and 
when we became independent, it got worse. The point, however, 
is not the independence, but that we should move forward instead 
of remaining in the same place, or even worse, going back.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Starikevich report: "Parliament Prevents </F>
Shushkevich from Speaking"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- One of the most important tasks facing the 
13th Belarusian Supreme Soviet Session which resumed last week 
is the adoption of the republic's new Basic Law. 
  Until recently, the constitutional process in Belarus has 
been sluggish. The situation changed drastically when the 
ruling circles began to realize that the only way out of the 
existing situation was to introduce a presidential form of rule 
via the adoption of a new constitution. 
  Up until now, the only obstacle was the disorganization 
among 
deputies representing the interests of the nomenklatura. When a 
total of only 260 parliamentarians convened for the session, the 
task of gathering the requisite 230 votes seemed difficult. To 
resolve this problem, it was decided on the initiative of 
Gennadiy Kozlov, coordinator of the "Belarus" faction, to hold a 
staggered ballot on disputed aspects of the draft constitution 
using personal voting slips. In this way, as many deputies as 
possible would be given an opportunity to express their views 
over several days. In addition, this type of ballot affords a 
measure of control over parliamentarians whose loyalty is in 
doubt. Previously, "unreliable" deputies, finding themselves in 
the hall of sessions under the watch of colleagues upon whom 
they often depend for their position, pressed the right buttons 
as a rule. But as soon as the matter went as far as a secret 
ballot through the polling booths, between 20 and 30 
parliamentarians from the majority would rebel. 
  Now they have been deprived of this possibility: The voting 
process is controlled entirely. 
  To simplify the task considerably, the deputies are adopting 
the consitution in whole chapters, each comprising between 10 
and 15 articles. 
  Meanwhile, former Supreme Soviet Speaker Stanislav 
Shushkevich has completed his country vacation. A series of 
meetings with voters, as well as participation in the 
consultative conference of patriotic-democratic forces, prompt 
the conclusion that Shushkevich does not intend to leave 
politics. In the current situation, he will rely primarily on 
the bloc of democratic parties which gravitate toward the 
center. They in turn are keen to cooperate with Shushkevich 
whom they consider a realistic contender for the post of 
president at future elections. 
  As members of the Tellers' Commission told IZVESTIYA's 
correspondent, as of 1000 hours 1 March, 245 deputies had 
answered "yes" to the questions on the voting slip. And one 
more thing. An unprecedented incident occured: During his 
address to the session under the "Any Other Business" section, 
Stanislav Shushkevich's microphone was cut off after he said: 
"You only want seats here because your are simply not fit for 
any other job."

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rudkowski] </F>
  [Text] Today at the Supreme Soviet session, as usual, 
people's deputies, devoted half an hour to addresses on 
miscellaneous topics on the agenda. Next, a discussion on the 
new draft constitution was resumed. In particular, the 
discussion focused on the status of the official language in the 
Republic of Belarus. The deputies adopted an article of the 
draft constitution, which provides Belarusian with the status of 
the official language, while Russian is confirmed as the 
language of interethnic intercourse [mizhnatsyyanalnyya znosiny]. 
  Following the discussion, the deputies adopted Article 40 of 
the draft constitution, which provides the citizens of the 
Republic of Belarus with a guarantee of the right to work -- the 
most dignified way of man's self-realization -- that is, the 
right to choose a profession, job, and employment in accordance 
with personal ability, education, and vocational training as 
well as with due regard to social needs; it also includes the 
right to healthy and secure working conditions. 
  The deputies also adopted Article 66 of the draft 
constitution, which stipulates the election procedure in our 
state, as well as Article 73 concerning a referendum in the 
Republic. A referendum, reads this article, shall be organized 
by the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus following a 
request by the Republic's president or by a body of no less than 
450,000 citizens eligible to vote. Today's session proceedings 
positively resolved the question of changes and amendments to 
the basic law of our state. 
  One more deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet was also 
elected today. This honor was extended to People's Deputy 
Uladzimir Vasilyevich Rusakevich, deputy head of the executive 
committee of the Brest council of people's deputies. The session 
will be resumed at 1600 [1400 GMT].

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] After the addresses in the 
miscellaneous section on the Supreme Soviet agenda, the people's 
deputies registered themselves. There were 267 deputies at the 
morning session. Following a short debate, they began to 
discuss certain articles of the Constitution as well as 
amendments and supplements. Deputies' questions were answered 
by republic's Attorney General Vasil Shaladonaw. 
  After a short break, the parliament resumed its work. 
However, it turned out that the number of people's deputies 
significantly dropped after the break. Due to this, the session 
was adjourned until 15 March.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Starikevich report: "Belarusian Parliament </F>
Actively Dislikes IZVESTIYA and Ostankino"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- A monopoly on news is one of the most 
typical characteristics of a totalitarian state. The Belarusian 
authorities, which have created a powerful propaganda apparatus 
based on the republic publications which depend on them, are now 
trying to dictate their will to foreign mass media. 
  Representatives of the nomenklatura are expressing, directly 
from the Supreme Soviet rostrum, their dissatisfaction with the 
fact that some people's opinions differ from the official line 
about events and processes occurring in the Republic. Last week 
Valeriy Tikhinya, former secretary of the Communist Party of 
Belarus Central Committee and currently one of the leaders of 
the Belarusian pro-Communist people's movement, stated that 
certain mass media are covering events occurring in our republic 
today in a distorted and biased way. This primarily applies to 
materials published in NARODNAYA GAZETA, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, and 
IZVESTIYA, and to the Ostankino television channel news.... 
This type of article, he believes, plays into the hands of 
right-wing extremist and nationalistic forces, and is aimed at 
destabilizing the situation in the republic. 
  As always in such cases, there were no specific complaints 
made against the mass media. They are biased, and that is that. 
One is amazed by the aplomb used in a speech by a man about 
whom the ordinary citizens expressed their attitude back in 
August 1991. At that time, indignation about his behavior was 
so great that it overflowed into not entirely decorous forms: 
When Tikhinya left the square outside Government House he had 
literally been spat upon. 
  His thankless task was continued by Belarusian Parliament 
Speaker Mechyslaw Hryb. Speaking at the 1 March session, he 
accused the SVOBODA and IZVESTIYA newspapers of compromising him 
as an individual and particularly as Supreme Soviet chairman. 
  Hryb assured everyone that the rumors about him are entirely 
unfounded. At the same time, he not only did not cite any 
evidence disproving them, but he did not even indicate what 
exactly he was talking about. Or is it that everything that is 
written about the speaker by newspapers which are not 
subordinate to him does not correspond to reality? 
  It is indicative that 20 minutes before giving this speech, 
Hryb switched off the microphone used by his predecessor 
Stanislav Shushkevich, accusing him of insulting the people's 
deputies. What was this about? It was about the fact that the 
former chairman of the Supreme Soviet dared to remind his 
colleagues about the promise to hold early parliamentary 
elections in March 1994. Thus it is not only the journalists' 
mouths they are trying to close. 
  Such speeches would be the strictly personal affair of the 
people making them if it were not for two circumstances. First 
of all, these are people invested with power and called upon to 
observe certain standards of decency. Second, these statements 
are periodically alternated with threats to refuse the 
accreditation of objectionable foreign mass media and, as it 
happens, the Belarusian Foreign Ministry is dealing with 
accreditations right now. Meanwhile, behind the scenes in the 
Supreme Soviet, reports are being actively circulated to the 
effect that a group of deputies intends to address to the 
Foreign Ministry a message about the expediency of giving 
accreditation to IZVESTIYA and the Ostankino Television 
Broadcasting Company. If this happens, the people's 
representatives will primarily put themselves in a ridiculous 
position. But the initiators of the planned message are 
apparently not too worried about this: To make up for it, no 
one will get in the way of their reviving a communist state.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 1/3/1994 -- In spite of 
deficiencies of the Law on Elections, of infringements committed 
by officials representing governing parties and even by CEC 
[Central Electoral Commission], of the TV monopoly in conditions 
of a free press which is only at its birth, elections in Moldova 
can he called, compared with the last ones, democratic, asserts 
Anastasia Afanasieva in the weekly DNYEVNIY EXPRESS. More than 
5,000 representatives of various parties and social-political 
movements, as well as 134 foreign observers from the Council of 
Europe, CSCE and other organizations have followed them. "Will 
these elections approach us to a real democracy?" wonders the 
author, estimating that the electorate had voiced for "memories 
of the past." Speculative political declarations on the 
independence of Moldova, national problems, the cynical game 
with "Russian-speakers" and pensioners gave the expected results 
-- the victory of agrarians and socialists, Afanasieva asserts. 
Forecasting an eventual evolution of social-political events, 
the quoted source states that the opposition does not haste to 
"take part in a coalition government," and neither do agrarians 
want to share the power with them. According to the author, the 
new parliament will stick in political problems -- the 
Constitution, Dniester, the south. Under economical aspect, 
realizing that reforms cannot be avoided, the Agrarian 
Democratic Party of Moldova (PDAM) and socialists have striven 
for power in order to "direct the chaotic motion towards a free 
market, which the premier and president proudly call reforms, 
into their own pockets." The scandal between agrarians and the 
Privatization Department did not mean at all that PDAM is 
against privatization, it rather dislikes that this process does 
not belong to it. Eventual quarrels can occur between agrarians, 
socialists and social-democrats only concerning the destination 
of preferential credits. From the opposition's point of view, 
we should he happy: "The more definite is the victory, the 
sooner the unsolvability of winners will manifest," the authors 
concludes.

<F P=106> [Svetlana Gamova report: "Moldova Does Not Want Unification </F>
With Romania. This Is How the Results of the Parliamentary 
Elections Can Be Interpreted"] 
  [Text] Chisinau -- The initial results of the elections in 
Moldova provide a basis for forecasting the upcoming 6 March 
national poll on unification with Romania. The defeat for the 
People's Front clearly reflects the population's failure to 
countenance the slogan of unification with Romania. Even at 
this stage, it can be said that victory has been won by 
supporters of the republic's independence. 
  Some 42 percent of the votes went to the Agrarian-Democratic 
Party, while the left-wing bloc embracing the socialists and the 
"Unity" movement received 25 percent, with just 6 percent of 
voters favoring the People's Front alliance. Petru Lucinschi, 
chairman of the old parliament who ran for the agrarians, 
expressed the conviction that the Agrarian-Democratic Party will 
win the right to form a new government. The majority of seats 
in the new parliament will go to the agrarians and left-wing 
parties. The People's Front, together with the "Peasants and 
Intelligentsia" bloc which is standing on its platform, can 
expect one-fifth of the deputies' mandates at best. 
  If victory for the agrarians was wholly predictable, the 
information received from the southern regions, which declared 
their intention to vote just two weeks before the elections, 
came as a shock. Having boycotted Moldovan political life for 
over three years, this region, which is densely populated by 
Gagauz and Bulgars, demonstrated by far the greatest 
zealousness. Around 90 percent of voters went to the polls. By 
expressing confidence in the republic's new parliament in 
advance, the Gagauz are hoping, having obtained President 
Snegur's word, to draw attention to the fate of their region in 
the opening days of session. If the status of the south is 
again evaded by the deputies, the Gagauz will return to their 
original demand for an autonomous republic. 
  However, the majority won by the agrarians and socialists in 
the new parliament in practice nullifies this outcome. A real 
basis for resolving the problem of the Dniester region will 
emerge. 
  The agrarian region's population expressed a preference not 
for the party of the same name but for the socialists. The 
left-wing bloc represents the ethnic minorities most broadly. 
Given that, in terms of candidate profiles the other parties 
are in fact mono-ethnic, then it is not surprising that the 
Gagauz, the Bulgars, and the Russian-speaking population from 
the central part of Moldova cast their votes in favor of this 
bloc. Nevertheless, owing to the Dniester region's 
nonparticipation in the elections, the ethnic profile of the 
republic (35 percent of whose inhabitants are not Moldovan) will 
not be reflected in the new legislative organ. 
  Simultaneously with the poll on the status of Moldova, there 
will be a referendum in the south inviting the population to 
decide whether it agrees that the southern regions should 
develop as an autonomous national-territorial formation within 
Moldova. An affirmative response depends directly upon the 
final disposition of forces in the new parliament.

<F P=106> [Shakhnoza Ganiyeva report over video from Tashkent, </F>
including recorded interview with Anatoliy Adamishin, Russian 
deputy minister of foreign affairs; from the "Utro" program] 
  [Text] The situation on the southern borders of the CIS 
countries, and primarily on the Tajik-Afghan border, is cause 
for concern among many world politicians. Our correspondent 
Shakhnoza Ganiyeva reports on the efforts of Russia and 
Uzbekistan in the peaceful settlement of this conflict. 
  [Ganiyeva] Anatoliy Adamishin, Russian deputy minister of 
foreign affairs, has arrived in Tashkent for a short visit. 
After a series of meetings with leaders of the foreign policy 
department of Uzbekistan he departed for Dushanbe. Before his 
visit to Tajikistan, during an interview for viewers of this 
morning program, Anatoliy Adamishin said that Russia pays very 
serious attention to what is happening in this region, 
particularly on the Tajik-Afghan border where the collective 
peacekeeping forces are deployed today. 
  You will recall that according to an agreement existing 
between Russia and Uzbekistan on cooperation regarding certain 
international issues, these two countries are exerting every 
effort in order to ease by political means the tense situation 
on the Tajik-Afghan border, which in fact is the southern border 
of the CIS countries. 
  [Begin Adamishin recording] Well, generally this is not a 
very easy task, and of course it is not close--not close--but it 
seems to me that gradually we are nevertheless moving towards 
this matter, maybe not as fast as we would like. Presently the 
most realistic option for talks are talks which can be held 
under the sponsorship of the United Nations, under the UN 
Secretary General's special representative Piris-Ballon. There 
is an agreement in this regard both with the government of 
Tajikistan and with the Tajik opposition. We are now talking 
about selecting a venue for these talks. 
  It is our shared view with the Uzbek government and the 
Tajik 
government too, to begin these talks as soon as possible and 
finally determine what we will talk about. But unfortunately 
the Afghan groups are interfering in this matter. The 
fundamentalist and extremist forces of several Muslim countries 
are interfering in this. Of course, if this factor of external 
interference were removed I think the Tajiks would more easily 
find a common language with one another. [end recording] 
  Peace talks are the only possible and realistic choice. If 
goodwill is demonstrated by both sides this could remove the 
tension along the border, or at least alleviate it.

<F P=106> [Report over video by correspondent Aleksandr Shkirando, </F>
including recorded remarks by Uzbek President Islam Karimov on 
recent visit to Russia, date and place not given; from the 
"Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Shkirando] It is rather difficult to say something 
specific about the results of a visit by the Uzbek president 
which has just ended, especially as on the eve of the visit some 
kind of nervousness could be felt in Russian-Uzbek relations. 
This was caused by the issue of protection of the 
Russian-speaking population and also by the fact that Uzbekistan 
is, in some way, drawn towards Turkey, Iran and Pakistan. 
However, the large package of documents signed in Moscow shows 
that Uzbekistan nevertheless wants closer ties with Russia 
practically in all spheres. 
  [Karimov] This is a new step in relations between Russia and 
those states which were created after the disintegration of the 
Soviet Union. And I want to say that in this Russia acted 
honorably. 
  [Shkirando] The Uzbek leader made some critical remarks 
concerning some issues, above all economic problems. It seems 
to me that not only the Russian commercial structures should 
think about this. 
  [Karimov] Russia is a great power. It should not lose the 
markets which it had on the territory of the former Soviet 
Union. If Russian enterprises do not export their production to 
these regions, other corporations and companies will come. They 
are waiting for just one thing -- to quietly infiltrate these 
regions and these markets, and to gain these markets through 
credits, sometimes credits given on preferential terms. Who in 
this world would give up their positions voluntarily as far as 
the markets are concerned?

suffered loses during the battles. According to preliminary 
reports, four Karabakh defenders were killed and 15 injured. 
The Azerbaijani side lost 70 soldiers and officers killed. 
Three enemy armored vehicles were destroyed. 
  The same source reported at 1800 today that the military 
operations are still continuing at that sector of the war front. 
  The Armenian Defense Ministry press service reported that 
the 
situation on the Armenian borders have remained calm since last 
night.

<F P=106> ["Mir" Television Company video report from Armenia by </F>
reporter Nuna Sarkisyan; from the "Utro" program] 
  [Text] It was exactly one year in February since the fourth 
prime minister of independent Armenia assumed his official 
duties. A Grant Bagratyan news conference was scheduled to 
coincide with this minor anniversary. [Video shows Grant 
Bagratyan at news conference] The head of the cabinet took 
almost an hour and a half to report on work of the cabinet, 
during which it became clear that in spite of the difficult 
situation in 1993, the harsh blockade by both Azerbaijan and 
Georgia, and the energy crisis, the parameters of national 
income from industry and agriculture -- even when taking into 
consideration the decline from the previous year -- can be 
considered an accomplishment. Evidently, the fact that prices 
increased 110-fold while salaries increased by a factor of 3.5 
times can also be considered an accomplishment. Living 
standards decreased by 55 percent. However, this situation 
undoubtedly has objective reasons: a general crisis in all 
spheres, military spending, and conversion to a national 
currency. 
  Inflation was somewhat slowed and [word indistinct] was 
somewhat stabilized at the juncture of 1993 and 1994. In a 
word, we are much better off than we could have been. By the 
way, Bagratyan held his news conference after his meeting with 
the Russian prime minister. [Video shows interview with Grant 
Bagratyan] 
  [Begin recording] [Bagratyan] The worsening of the situation 
in Armenia causes a worsening in Russia also, even if on a 
smaller scale. Each country is dealing with its own problem, 
but at the same time they are already trying to take notice of 
each other. This situation will continue for a year or a year 
and a half. After that, the recreation of the ruble zone will 
be the task which would, I would say, allow for larger 
integration. The question facing us now is not integration, but 
prevention of disintegration. [end recording]

  [Text] Tbilisi, 3 [Mar] -- According to an IBERIA 
correspondent, the Abkhaz separatists' leader Vladislav Ardzinba 
in his interview given to Russian radio said that if the UN 
Security Council adopted a decision on deploying peacekeeping 
forces on the whole of the Abkhaz territory, the Abkhaz 
population would resist, even if this function were to be 
delegated to the Russian Army. 
  "Peacekeeping forces must be deployed not on the whole of 
Abkhaz territory, but only in the zone of the conflict, that is, 
along the Inguri River", said Vladislav Ardzinba. 
  The similar statement was earlier made in Geneva by the 
leader of the Abkhaz delegation, Sokrat Jinjolia.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 03, BNS -- The Russian Foreign 
Ministry on Wednesday [2 March] called in the counselor of the 
Estonian Embassy, Artur Laast, to deliver to Estonia a protest 
over recent statements by Estonian officials defined in the 
protest as "unfriendly" toward Russia. 
  The director of the 2nd department for Europe at the 
ministry, Yuriy Fokin, delivered to Laast an oral protest on 
statements by Estonian officials, and particularly, a speech by 
Estonian President Lennart Meri in Hamburg on Feb. 25, a 
representative of the Russian Foreign ministry said in a 
briefing today. 
  Moscow characterized as "anti-Russian" Meri's calls on the 
West not to trust Russia who, the Estonian leader said, is 
continuing on the path of imperialistic policy, as well as 
Meri's negative assessment of the activity of Russian 
peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia. The Russian 
Foreign Ministry says that Meri's statement about the role of 
the Russian peacekeeping units, in particular, are aimed against 
stabilization in the region. 
  "The biased character of the speech by Lennart Meri on the 
whole lends proof to the opinion that the Estonian leadership is 
using every opportunity to add rigidity to its position in the 
relations with Russia," the Foreign Ministry representative said. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry says that such statements by 
the 
Estonian head of state, made in a third country, "exceed the 
limits of generally acknowledged international norms." 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry in the message delivered to the 
Estonian diplomat "expressed hope that Tallinn would find 
strength to stop shifting toward confrontation with Moscow." The 
Russian Foreign Ministry says that responsibility for the 
possible effects of such drive wholly lies with the Estonian 
side.

  [Text] Moscow, Mar 03, BNS -- Russia did not call off the 
negotiations with Estonia but just took a time-out to consider 
the situation that has emerged, a senior foreign ministry 
official told BNS in a telephone interview today. 
  Alexandr Udaltsev, senior official in charge of relations 
with the Baltics at the Russian Foreign Ministry, said his 
country had no intention to cause any protraction over 
determining the date for the next round of negotiations. He 
said protraction was "not in Russia's interests." The diplomat 
said his country now had to decide as quickly as possible on how 
to act. 
  Udaltsev said Russia might well return to the earlier 
suggested Aug. 31 deadline for the withdrawal of its troops from 
Estonia if "the Estonian party abides by the conditions already 
on several occasions quoted by Russia." 
  "It is necessary that the Estonian party took into 
consideration the minimum interests of Russia, and then we will 
be ready to meet them halfway over the deadlines," he said. 
  Udaltsev reiterated the importance Russia gives to the issue 
of its retired military living in Estonia. "We cannot go away 
leaving them in a state of being let down. We are expected to 
cut the terms of the troop withdrawal, and Estonia wishes that a 
considerable deal of these people left together with the troops. 
This is a prospect we cannot accept," he said. 
  He said it would be "very sad and shortsighted" if Estonia 
declared breaking off the talks. He mentioned that "refusing 
from negotiations is a senseless thing to do in any situation, 
they must go on and continue under whatever circumstances except 
for the very extreme ones." 
  Commenting of the topic of the deadline for the pullout of 
troops from the Estonian territory, Udaltsev claimed that Russia 
was "not shifting any deadlines." He said that taking the 
suggested date of Aug. 31 as a formal deadline was a mistake 
that emerged largely due the activity of Russia's partners in 
the talks. 
  Udaltsev said the delegations since last November had 
"discussed the possibility to withdraw troops by Aug. 31," and 
that this had just been a position for the talks. Russia told 
nobody about it, never took an obligation, the diplomat said, 
adding that the date existed nowhere in the CSCE and U.N. 
documents on the issue. 
  He said there had existed a position for the negotiating 
process, which was linked to certain circumstances. These 
circumstances, in his words, have passed by the present moment, 
and, along with them, the negotiating position passed. "One can 
return to it and consider it anew," he added. 
  Udaltsev said Russia under international resolutions had 
taken the obligation to pull its troops out "quickly, in an 
organized and orderly manner," and, as the resolutions 
emphasize, according to the respective agreements. He said 
these agreements were clearly named in the resolution of a 
foreign ministers meeting that took place in Rome at the end of 
last year. These are the agreements on the troop withdrawal, on 
social security guarantees for retired military, and, he added, 
also mentioned there is an agreement on the radar station at 
Skrunda, Latvia. "Our partners must read these resolutions with 
more attention and freshen the memory about by whom, where and 
what kind and obligations were taken," he said. 
  He reminded that Russia so far had brought only forward the 
final date for its troop withdrawal -- starting from 1999, and 
finishing with 1994. 
  Commenting on Estonia's reaction to his own remarks over the 
recent period, Udaltsev said it seemed to him that Estonia only 
needed "some kind of pretext." In his words Estonians had 
understood that they are entering a new round of negotiations 
without any serious baggage, and, therefore, had decided to make 
a sensation out of his remarks. 
  The two countries should not waste their time seeking faults 
with each other but must simply sit down at a table and 
seriously look for a compromise, the Russian diplomat concluded.

  [Text] The head of the Estonian parliament's Foreign 
Affairs Commission has suggested negotiating with Russia behind 
closed doors in a third country to break what he regards as an 
impasse in the current Estonian-Russian talks. 
  Vello Saatpalu told Interfax on Thursday that the last round 
of negotiations at which Russia said it might go back on the 
previously proposed deadline for its troop withdrawal from 
Estonia, had shown the senselessness of further talks on the 
same lines. 
  Saatpalu said he was in favor of parliamentary as well as 
governmental contacts. "The Estonian ambassador to Russia has 
been given instructions to discuss in Moscow the possibility of 
a meeting between the parliamentary commissions on foreign 
affairs," he said. 
  Saatpalu said he objected to the proposal, made by the 
Estonian delegation at the last round of talks with Russia, that 
the two countries take their border dispute to the International 
Court in The Hague. 
  He criticized the idea, advocated by some Estonian 
politicians, that the Estonian-Russian border is immutable since 
it was established by the Tartu Peace Treaty of 1920 and is 
formalized by the present Estonian constitution. 
  "Those who make this assertion are either uneducated or lazy 
and don't want to read," for the Constitution says Estonia's 
land frontier is established not only by that document but also 
by international treaties, he said. 
  But he rejected any compromise on social security for 
retired 
Russian military officers living in Estonia, an issue Russia 
links to a deadline for its troop withdrawal. 
  "Residence permits can only be issued to elderly pensioners, 
the rest must leave the country unconditionally," he said.

  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Juri Luik has returned from his 
visit to Sweden. At Tallinn airport he was asked to comment, 
among other things, on Estonian-Russian talks. 
  [Begin Luik recording] [Passage omitted] The Swedish side, 
the Swedish Government has provided strong support to Estonia 
and Sweden sees this Russian date of 31 August 1994 (?as a 
pledge by Russia). This is how the Western countries have 
understood this date and the Russian side's proposal. There is 
the intention to emphasize this strongly to the Russian side in 
front of the international public. The Swedish Government 
promised to (?get in touch) with other countries' governments to 
rally support on this issue. [passage omitted] 
  As far as my comment goes, well, if the other party behaves 
completely irrationally, the Estonian side has no option but to 
behave rationally and calmly. The government will meet, of 
course and decide what to do next. But we will continue to hold 
the position that 31 August 1994 is in fact [word indistinct] on 
the Russian side; a promise to this effect has indeed been made. 
Naturally, the Russian side, should it want to do so, can always 
withdraw the troops before this date; we have nothing against 
that. The situation now is that the talks have, in essence, been 
broken off. [passage omitted: The Russian side was to have put 
forward a date for the next round but failed to do so] [end 
recording]

<F P=106> ["Press release" from the Estonian Ministry of Foreign </F>
Affairs in Tallinn on 3 March] 
  [Text] March 3, 1994 -- At a press conference following 
the 17th round of Estonian-Russian talks in Tallinn March 2, 
Russian Ambassador Vasiliy Svirin again described Russian 
military pensioners in Estonia as "mostly old age people," a 
characterization greatly at odds with reality. Mr. Svirin 
claimed that a lack of "social guarantees" for retired former 
Soviet occupation (now Russian) soldiers in Estonia is one 
reason why the remaining 2,600 active duty troops cannot be 
withdrawn by Russia. 
  Although required to withdraw its troops from Estonia 
"completely and unconditionally," Russia continues to delay and 
unilaterally to attach conditions. Russia is demanding that, in 
addition to providing "social guarantees," Estonia make a very 
generous gift to its former occupiers by giving Russian military 
personnel title to the apartments or houses in which they live 
in Estonia. Russia also demands that Estonia pay $23,000,000 to 
build housing for the troops being withdrawn from Estonia. This 
works out to about $10,000 per Russian soldier still in Estonia. 
  Moscow pays military pensions to 10,570 persons in Estonia. 
This includes pensioners of the armed forces, the border guard, 
internal troops and KGB and persons who receive assistance due 
to loss of income earner. Although under no obligation to do 
so, Estonia has set up a procedure by which retired Russian 
military personnel can apply for residence permits in Estonia. 
Due to obvious national security concerns and the special 
nature of this category of pensioner, each case must be 
individually evaluated and decided by the Estonian authorities. 
  The retired Russian military are surprisingly young. Over 
6,000 are under the age of sixty. Of these, over 1,000 are 
under 50, with 360 of them between the ages of 35 and 45. 
  Typical Russian military pensioners in Estonia include: 
  Gennadiy A, age 41. Counterintelligence. Tallinn. 
  Yuriy R, age 39. Counterintelligence. Tallinn. 
  Gennadiy G, age 40. Counterintelligence. Tallinn. 
  Gennadiy S, age 36. Assault paratrooper. Viljandi. 
  Valeriy S, age 37. Assault paratrooper. Viljandi. 
  Pavel P, age 37. Counterintelligence. Klooga. 
  Ivan P, age 46. Counterintelligence. Tallinn. 
  Vadim K, age 43. Counterintelligence. Tallinn. 
  Aleksandr J, age 44. Counterintelligence. Tallinn. 
  Andrey P, age 37. Assault paratrooper. Viljandi. 
  Sergey S, age 41. Assault paratrooper. Viljandi. 
  Vladimir K, age 42. Assault paratrooper. Viljandi. 
  Russian military pensioners in Estonia have formed a War 
Veteran's Union. The Russian military presence in all its forms 
in Estonia represents a great threat to Estonia's security and 
stability. Not only do they harass the local residents, but 
they are also known to have close connections to criminal 
elements. Their ready access to weapons and explosives compounds 
the danger.

  [Text] Retired Russian servicemen living in Estonia are 
surprisingly young and thus constitute a danger to Estonian 
national security. The Estonian Foreign Ministry has emphasized 
this in a statement. The document notes that of 10,500 retired 
Russian military men here, 6,000 are under 60 years of age; over 
1,000 are under 50; and 360 men are as young as 35 to 45. 
  Vasiliy Svirin, the leader of the Russian talks delegation, 
said at a news conference yesterday that the majority of the 
retired servicemen are elderly people who must be allowed to end 
their days in peace. As is known, Russia is refusing to 
conclude a troop withdrawal agreement if no agreement is signed 
simultaneously on social guarantees for the retired military 
men. The Estonian Foreign Ministry notes that Svirin's claim 
about the retired servicemen's age is not accurate. A typical 
retired serviceman living in Estonia is a former 
counterintelligence officer or a paratrooper, aged 36-46, the 
Foreign Ministry declares in its statement. 
  The Foreign Ministry stresses that Russian military presence 
in any form at all is very dangerous for Estonian security. 
Russian retired servicemen not only generate anxiety for the 
local population but have also close links with criminal 
elements, the statement says. The Foreign Ministry adds that 
despite these circumstances Estonia has introduced a procedure 
whereby retired servicemen can apply for residence permits. As 
the issue is very important from the point of view of state 
security, Estonian officials must process each case on an 
individual basis. This is what the statement says, according to 
BNS.

  [Text] Vice-chairman of the Riigikogu [parliament] Tunne 
Kelam returned from a CE [Council of Europe] Parliamentary 
Assembly bureau session in Paris yesterday and held a news 
conference. 
  Kelam announced that the CE political committee report on 
Estonia's obligation was highly positive and stressed that 
Estonia had done the maximum possible in the circumstances and 
time limits. Kelam had also discussed the Russian issue, 
stressing that Russia's admission must be considered calmly and 
without any pressure from outside. He referred to a EU council 
declaration which had stressed the need to admit Russia in the 
CE as soon as possible. 
  "I pointed out, among other things, that Russia granted 
amnesty to the coup organisers, that the positions of the 
military are constantly strengthening there, and mentioned that 
Russia is going back on its promise to pull out its troops by 
August 31," Kelam told the news conference.

  [Text] President Lennart Meri addressed the Farmers 
Congress opened in Tartu yesterday. Over 500 delegates and a 
number of visitors and journalists had convened in the 
"Vanemuine" Theatre. Director of the Farmers' Central Union Karl 
Nurm opened the congress, expressing his hope that it will find 
answers to the current problems of the farmers. 
  President Meri stressed the role of agriculture in Estonia's 
economy and the current problems. He compared the present 
situation with the War of Independence and pointed out that the 
rear of the country is weak for three reasons: the land is 
still owned by the state, there is no definite idea of future 
development and a mistaken idea of Estonia as a poor state is 
spreading. Estonia is a wealthy country thanks to its farmers, 
Meri stressed, criticising the development experts who offer 
expensive and impractical solutions: "itinerant preachers who 
sell banalities rather than bananas." 
  He called the farmers to seek for solutions instead of 
culprits and stressed the need for unity and cooperation. "I 
hope that the return of the 140,000 prewar farms to their lawful 
owners will not result in 140,000 lawsuits," the president said. 
  Prime Minister Mart Laar also addressed the congress, 
explaining that the restoration of the agriculture will take 
time. He stressed that the present government has done all it 
can to accelerate the changes and announced that 30 million 
kroons are available for long-term credit to farmers. He also 
asked a number of questions that the congress was expected to 
answer so that the government could decide on further moves. 
The government cannot accept a single rich city surrounded by 
poor rural areas, Laar stressed. 
  Chairman of the Agricultural Producers Central Union Andres 
Varik recommended to turn the congress into a permanent body. 
The congress also discussed the land, ownership and 
administrative reforms and the social problems. 
  The congress will continue today.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 03, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar, speaking at the opening of a meeting of the country's 
farm sector representatives, said reform in the agriculture was 
lagging behind and that losing time on making only minor 
improvements was now having its effect on the rural life. 
  The prime minister said protracting was evident in carrying 
out reforms in farming. "This has cost much to Estonia. It is 
the time lost that poses the greatest problem to us," he said. 
  Laar in his speech said farmers should not count on a quick 
way to prosperity, as it would take more than a year or two to 
make up for what has been done to the country's traditional 
agricultural economy during 50 years of Communist rule. 
  The prime minister said that his Cabinet when coming to 
power 
in 1992 had chosen the path of continuing the reform on the 
basis of the already existing laws, also trying to improve some 
of the latter "en route." 
  Laar said the government expected from the congress 
proposals 
on ways to help develop the rural sector, but he also warned 
that populist measures would lead both Estonia as a country, as 
well as its rural life to a disaster.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 02, BNS -- The Defense Ministry will 
start negotiations with two companies to rent out the North Port 
of Paldiski, Tarmo Molder, the ministry deputy chancellor, told 
BNS. He declined for the time being to disclose the names of the 
companies. 
  The details of the lease will be worked out in the course of 
the talks, Molder said, but the ministry gives top priority to 
border guard and defense forces' vessels having access to the 
port. 
  One of the two companies plans to use the port facilities 
for 
trade in groceries, and the range of activities proposed by the 
other firm is even wider, Molder noted. 
  The ministry expects to wrap up the deal by March 9. The 
port will be rented out for a term of three years. 
  The Tallinna Sadam (Port of Tallinn) company is seeking a 
good business plan to develop Paldiski's South Port. It has so 
far received about a dozen projects but as new plans keep coming 
in the company's administrative board at its recent meeting put 
off making a decision, General Director Peeter Palu said in an 
earlier interview with BNS. 
  The South Port of Paldiski is ice-free round the year. 
  The projects mostly propose building an oil terminal at the 
port or using it for export of timber and metal, Palu said. 
  Neither the Defense Ministry nor the Port of Tallinn is 
prepared to consider joining the two ports, since one is 
determined to keep it a naval port and the other regards it as a 
commercial port.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Kuchina] </F>
  [Text] Riga, 3 Mar -- In a note passed to the Latvian 
Foreign Ministry the Russian Embassy today expressed serious 
concern over articles in a number of Latvian newspapers. 
  For several months the newspapers PAVALSTNIEKS and ATMODA 
have been printing the names of Russian servicemen, members of 
their families, and well-known personalities in Latvia. Their 
addresses, telephone numbers, and information of a personal 
nature are being published. Included in the lists were Vladimir 
Steshenko, deputy editor of the Russian-language newspaper 
SM-SEGODNYA; Fedor Shinkarenko, hero of the Soviet Union who 
liberated Latvia from fascism; Retired General Ivan Kibal, also 
a hero of the Soviet Union, and many others. These lists are 
being published under the caption "Our Land Is Groaning Under 
Their Boots." 
  The Russian Embassy note stresses that the lists are 
dominated by Russian citizens whose personal data is being given 
wide publicity without their knowledge or consent. The 
information is being published under provocative headlines. The 
safety of these people is being jeopardized. The embassy 
considers that such actions by certain Latvian periodicals could 
lead to unwelcome incidents with unforeseeable consequences. In 
this event, the note says, the Latvian authorities will have to 
bear the entire blame. The Russian Federation Embassy expressed 
the hope that the authorities would take the necessary measures 
to prevent such a development of events, which could harm 
Russian-Latvian relations.

  [Text] Today the Saeima appointed Olafs Bruvers, deputy of 
the Union of Christian Democrats of Latvia in the Saeima, as 
minister of state for human rights. Bruvers said his main task 
will be to protect the interests of the state against 
accusations by other countries of human rights violations in 
Latvia, as well as to regulate the dialogue between Latvians and 
non-Latvians, citizens and non-citizens. The minister of state 
for human rights will also be concerned with the elimination of 
possible violations of human rights. Bruvers named as important 
activities the protection of the rights of children and women, 
as well as the protection of soldiers serving in the defense 
forces for non-regulated [arpusreglamentu] relations. Bruvers 
is the first representative of the opposition in the cabinet of 
ministers led by Valdis Birkavs.

  [Text] Today the Saeima resolved to put aside discussion of 
the bill from the faction For the Fatherland and Freedom (?owing 
to its content). This bill entails not giving authority to the 
Latvian delegation to sign agreements which allow the operation 
of the Skrunda Radar station after 31 August this year. As 
Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs said in the debate, because of 
the secrecy and importance of the information, he could not 
refute the opposition's arguments in an open plenary session of 
the Saeima. Andrejevs emphasized that the government does not 
doubt that the further operation of Skrunda radar does not 
correspond to Latvia's interests, but the real political 
situation does not allow the government not to sign the 
agreement on the radar's operations for another five and a half 
years.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 03, BNS -- The Lithuanian Foreign 
Ministry expressed deep concern about Russia's statement March 2 
that it would not withdraw its troops from Estonia by Aug. 31 as 
was promised earlier. 
  In a statement released Thursday, the Lithuanian ministry 
said "the Republic of Lithuania once again confirms its position 
that the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia and Estonia 
must be carried in accordance with the requirements of the 
international community, which are indicated in the 47/21 
resolution of the United Nations and Article 15 of the CSCE 1992 
Final Document." 
  "Lithuania fully supports Estonia in its efforts to achieve 
a 
speedy withdrawal of the Russian army." The ministry expressed 
hope that Estonia and Russia will find mutually acceptable ways 
to resume bilateral talks and that Russian troops will leave 
Estonian territory by Aug. 31.

<F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Gromak: "The Enemies of Which People Are </F>
They Seeking in Lithuania this Time?"] 
  [Text] On Monday evening, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's Kaliningrad 
correspondents' center received a late caller. I cannot give 
you his name right now because he is afraid for his life and 
that of his close relatives living in Lithuania. 
  The visitor brought me Saturday's issue of the city 
newspaper 
KLAIPEDA (issue no. 38, 26 February). On page one the newspaper 
carried a photograph of Colonel Vitaliy Yegorov, former chief of 
the political department of the Baltic Fleet's coast defense 
division, when he was in Klaipeda. The comment under the 
headline "'Enemy of the People' Detained?" read like this: "It 
has been learned from unofficial sources that Vitaliy 
Leonidovich Yegorov, former chief of the political department of 
a USSR division stationed in Klaipeda, was detained in Klaipeda 
yesterday. 
  "A. Grublis, chief of the Klaipeda department of the 
Lithuanian Republic's security service, stated that nothing of 
the kind has happened. Nevertheless, when the newspaper had 
been prepared for the press, those same unofficial but reliable 
sources gave another guarantee that V.L. Yegorov had been 
detained and taken to Vilnius where he will be charged with 
antistate activity during the putsch in August 1991. If these 
facts are confirmed an international scandal can be expected 
because V.L. Yegorov is a Russian citizen who is backed by some 
fairly influential politicians." 
  "Vitaliy Leonidovich rang me late at night and said that he 
had been forced to hide because they wanted to arrest him. He 
asked me to go right to the president to request protection for 
a Russian officer and citizen," my visitor told me. 
  Colonel Vitaliy Yegorov has served a number of years in the 
coast defense division and I have often had occasion to meet 
with in the course of my work. 
  Criminal proceedings were instituted against him and Major 
General Ivan Chernykh, former division commander, two years ago 
after the events of August 1991. In April 1992, division 
commander Ivan Chernykh was unlawfully arrested by the 
Lithuanian prosecutor's office but was released that same day 
after firm actions by the Russian military and diplomats. I 
took part in the talks and the newspaper gave a detailed account 
of this unlawful act by the Lithuanian authorities. Now, three 
years later, Col Vitaliy Yegorov, another Russian serviceman, 
has been declared an "enemy of the people" in Klaipeda. 
  Of course, this comment in the Klaipeda city newspaper might 
have passed unnoticed. But the point is that it appeared right 
after the parliamentary address by Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin in which it was stated that Russia has in its possession 
a great many facts proving that our fellow countrymen are being 
subjected to discrimination in neighboring states. And it is 
Russia's duty not just to talk about ending such practices but 
to do something about it. This publication also appeared after 
the State Duma adopted the decree on the amnesty which applied 
among others to the participants in the events of August 1991... 
  Clearly someone had good reason for creating this fuss over 
the Russian President's statement and the State Duma's decision. 
They chose for this a target which has become customary in the 
Baltic region -- a citizen of the Russian Federation and a 
colonel in the Russian Army. It bears a familiar hallmark...

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "How Much and What Type of Army Does </F>
Lithuania Need?"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the State Defense Council held its 
meeting chaired by the president. The meeting discussed the 
possibilities of producing military equipment in Lithuania. A 
decision was adopted to coordinate all issues with Latvia and 
Estonia, and to set up a special working group to analyze the 
possibilities of its own production and assess its economic 
basis. 
  As V. Petkevicius, chairman of the Seimas [parliament] 
National Security Committee, reported to RESPUBLIKA, alongside 
these problems, the meeting also dealt with technical matters in 
deploying the Army and the issue of control over the airspace. 
RESPUBLIKA found out that the problem of the establishment of a 
peacekeeping battalion was postponed for another meeting which 
will, probably, be held on 7-14 March. According to V. 
Petkevicius, the "Partnership for Peace" agreement does not 
oblige a single country to form peacekeeping battalions or 
corps. Preliminary estimations show that the establishment of 
such a battalion or a corps would require about $30 and $10-12 
million, respectively. The Defense Council also had to consider 
the manner in which European standards must be applied to the 
Lithuanian Army. In V. Petkevicius' opinion, first of well, 
Lithuania should decide how much and what type of Army it needs. 
The military could claim 5 percent of the national budget at 
best. Unfortunately, the purchase of fighters will have to be 
abandoned, to say nothing of luxury cars for the National 
Defense Ministry. According to V. Petkevicius, fighters in 
Lithuania are as necessary as skis in Africa. 
  Speaking about the problems at the National Defense 
Ministry, 
the chairman of the Seimas National Security Committee noted 
that measures would be applied to prevent the temptation of 
dealing in arms -- a draft law regulating the purchase of arms 
for Lithuanian defense structures is being prepared. The draft 
law does not project that "arms will be bought by the Arms Fund 
alone, and that ministries will be only contractors and experts 
in arms quality." Currently, the Prosecutor General's Office is 
investigating 150 cases concerning disorder at the National 
Defense Ministry.

  [Excerpt] Five press conferences were held at the Seimas 
Palace today. Here is Madona Luckaite reporting about some of 
them. 
  [Luckaite] Chairman of the Center Union and Seimas member 
Romualdas Ozolas spoke on issues of Lithuanian foreign policy. 
In two weeks time a meeting of the presidents of the Baltic 
states should be held in Palanga during which the question of 
whether it is expedient to appeal to the United Nations 
concerning the recognition of the past occupation of the Baltic 
states. He said that Russia was making all efforts that no 
document would testify to the occupation of the Baltic States. 
Therefore the Lithuanian president should once again speak at 
this meeting for the strengthening of the security of all these 
countries. 
  Speaking about the Lithuanian-Polish treaty, Romualdas 
Ozolas 
said that a treaty where there is no assessment of the 
Zeligowski aggression, at least in a declaration, is not worth 
signing at all. The following version is even better: the treaty 
has been signed, however, the declaration has not. This would be 
a clear assessment of the aggression. The presently existing 
text of the treaty cannot be signed. International documents 
have to be worded clearly and [words indistinct] truth should be 
placed between Lithuania and Poland, Romualdas Ozolas stressed. 
Gediminas Vagnorius, member of the Lithuanian Seimas and 
chairman of the Lithuanian Conservative Party administration 
board, speaking at the press conference held by the Seimas 
opposition, said that 16 months have already passed after the 
Seimas elections; however, the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party 
had not yet started to carry out its duties. It is looking 
backwards and it is firmly aspiring to satisfy personal property 
interests. 
  So far it is impossible to see any signs of stabilization 
because the industrial output has fallen even by 2.5 times since 
the Seimas elections and continues to decline by ten percent 
every month. The real income of the population is maintained by 
using the credits received from abroad, yet in spite of this the 
average wages in the country at the beginning of this year 
reached only 290 litas while in the autumn of 1992 it was more 
than 600 litas. 
  Last year, ten percent of enterprises have been registered 
according to the law on primary privatization as separate 
companies avoiding the privatization departments and thus 
avoiding any payment. 
  Attempts are made to transfer property worth six or seven 
billion litas which is almost the amount of capital which had to 
be transferred to saving and other banks for the compensation of 
peoples lost savings. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 02, BNS -- Lithuania has nothing to 
conceal from Israel, Justas Paleckis, the Lithuanian president's 
foreign policy adviser, said commenting on reports that Israel 
is unsatisfied with the imaginary hostility of Lithuanians 
toward Jews. 
  Apart from publications in the Israeli press, Reuters 
recently quoted Israel's Justice Minister David Libai as saying 
that "the Lithuanian Government must bear responsibility for 
punishing war criminals and returning Jewish property stolen and 
confiscated in World War II." 
  The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry is still trying to obtain 
the 
official text of the Israeli minister's statement, but did not 
have it as of noon Wednesday. 
  In an interview with Lithuanian TV, Paleckis said relations 
with Israel must be based on the future as it is done in 
relations with Russia, Germany, Poland and other countries, but 
not on the past. "There is every possibility to have very good 
relations with Israel." 
  Vidmantas Vaicekauskas, senior investigator of the 
Lithuanian 
Prosecutor General's Office, said "this soap bubble about the 
lawfulness of rehabilitation is only a pretext,...everything 
lies in property problems of Jews." 
  Restitution in Lithuania is applied only to Lithuanian 
citizens who permanently live in the country. 
  Vaicekauskas said the Lithuanian legislation does not 
provide 
for a possibility to open a branch office of the Simon Wiesental 
Center in Lithuania because it is "a social organization of a 
foreign state."

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 03, BNS -- Opposition MP Gediminas 
Vagnorius disagrees with Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius that 
economic stabilization is already felt in Lithuania. 
  At a press conference Wednesday [2 March], Vagnorius said 
industry production after the 1992 parliamentary elections 
dropped 2.5 times and continues to decrease by 10 percent each 
month. In his words, if the process is not stopped, the 
industry will be in a very deep crisis already this year. 
  Vagnorius said the average salary has already dropped to a 
critical line. In his words, salaries have decreased two times 
since the fall of 1992. 
  The lawmaker said the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor 
Party cannot be blamed only for lack of competence. In his 
opinion, the party in power is so deeply involved in corruption 
that it can not make a move without approval of its "sponsors." 
Vagnorius, who is one of the leaders of the Conservative Party, 
said there is no other way to overcome the crisis but to hold 
early parliamentary elections in early 1995. 
  Some other rightist political forces suggest to elect a new 
parliament next fall.

<F P=106> [By Negmatullo Mirsaidov from Tajikistan; a "Mir" Television </F>
Company report from the "Utro" program] 
  [Text] Regardless of how the social and political 
situation is stabilizing within our state, the military topic 
will continue to occupy a prominent place in mass media reports 
for a long time to come insofar as the situation on the 
Tajik-Afghan border has once again become more tense in recent 
days. Fighters of the Tajik opposition based in the Islamic 
Republic of Afghanistan are subjecting border posts as well as 
villages near the border to mass shelling. They are even using 
rocket projectiles. 
  In connection with this the Republic of Tajikistan Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs has lodged a protest with the Government of 
the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in which it says that the 
Tajik side reserves the right to act, even to the extent of 
destroying fire points of the Tajik opposition fighters on the 
territory of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan if the 
Government of this state does not take the necessary measures. 
[video cuts from studio shot of Mirsaidov to show Colonel 
General Boris Pyankov, commander of the collective CIS 
peacekeeping forces in the Republic of Tajikistan, being 
interviewed by an unidentified reporter] 
  [Begin Pyankov recording] Today we cannot permit artillery 
and mortars to fire for half an hour with the aim of destroying 
a border post, a kyshlak [village], or other positions. We 
cannot remain inactive so it is precisely at this point that the 
danger arises of our forces, including the peacekeeping forces 
-- the Russian border guards and subunits of the Armed Forces of 
Tajikistan -- being drawn into battles with subunits and their 
firepower--to put it simply, the enemy forces on Afghan 
territory. All of this can further complicate the 
situation--and I stress complicate the situation--and nothing 
more. There cannot be any new major war, any new large-scale 
killing ground or new large-scale action. [end recording] 
  Regardless of the difficult situation in which our country 
finds itself, the people of Tajikistan look to the future with 
optimism. Enlivenment of the social and political life indicates 
that with every passing day the people are becoming even more 
optimistic.

  [Text] Moscow, 3 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- The participants in the 
1 March meeting of the Coordinating Consultative Committee of 
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CCC CIS) "in principle 
approved the proposal to consider Ukraine an associate member of 
the CIS Economic Union." They instructed experts to complete 
work on an agreement on the conditions for Ukraine to join the 
Economic Union as an associate member before the upcoming joint 
meeting of the heads of states and governments of the 
Commonwealth, which is expected to be held on 31 March. 
  Russian Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, commenting on 
the essence of this decision, stressed that when the Economic 
Union is discussing various questions, Ukraine will have the 
right to vote on those problems on which Ukraine has already 
ratified agreements within the CIS framework. During 
discussions of other questions Ukraine will have only the right 
of a consultative opinion. 
  Aleksandr Shokhin considers that "there will be no 
particular 
restrictions on Ukraine's activities within the framework of the 
Economic Union." He also noted that "Ukraine has moved further 
toward full membership than toward classical associate status." 
He considers that Ukraine's associate status in the CIS 
Economic Union is connected to a considerable extent with its 
internal political situation (the ratification of these 
documents will evidently be carried out by the next parliament). 
That is why Ukraine's associate status is a temporary 
situation, he explained. 
  Replying to a question about the possible time-scale for 
Ukraine to join the CIS Economic Union, Aleksandr Shokhin said 
that "this depends on Ukraine itself." He expressed the opinion 
that in order to have full and equal economic cooperation within 
the framework of the CIS, it is necessary for Ukraine "to smooth 
out" its economic policy and to overcome the trend toward 
hyperinflation.

  [Text] Moscow March 4 TASS -- TRUD on the Russian-Uzbek 
summit: 
  "It was the first time that Moscow welcomed the leader of a 
sovereign republic with a guard of honour and motorcycle 
outriders, the honour which was previously bestowed only on the 
leaders of foreign countries. 
  "However, this does not signify an estrangement but is 
indicative, rather, of the ongoing drawing of the two countries 
closer together at a fundamentally new level and of the 
restoration and strengthening of the age-old ties between Russia 
and Uzbekistan." 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the Russian-Uzbek accords: 
  "The accords reached in Moscow open up new opportunities for 
strengthening the political and economic relations between 
Russia and Uzbekistan. At the same time they encourage 
cooperation within the commonwealth of independent states". 
  PRAVDA on the Uzbek president's visit: 
  "The first official visit by Uzbekistan's head of state went 
off successfully. The results of the accords reached by the two 
presidents will undoubtedly make themselves felt already in the 
coming days". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) carries an interview with 
Lieutenant- General Aleksandr Lebed, commander of the 14th 
Russian Army in the Dniester region. 
  In response to a question about the future of the 14th Army, 
General Lebed said: "As is known, the leadership of the Republic 
of Moldova advocates the withdrawal of the army from its 
territory, but, to my mind, it is now impossible to withdraw the 
army for a variety of reasons, beginning with the fact that the 
sanguinary conflict between Moldova and the Dniester region has 
not been resolved politically and, accordingly, there are no 
guarantees of peace and stability in the region. 
  "The possibility of a new flare-up of hostilities has not 
disappeared. People view the 14th Army as the guarantor of 
peace and stability, the guarantor which can prevent war and, if 
it is unleashed, stop the bloodshed. Therefore, the army's 
withdrawal should be preceded by a rather long, delicate and 
wise political process which, unfortunately, has not yet begun". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the Bosnian peace process: 
  "The process of settling the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
on the principle of a threat of the use of force has reached a 
deadlock and leads to nowhere: NATO countries just cannot for 
years threaten with air strikes. Neither can the peoples of 
Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia to live for years under such a 
threat... 
  "It is important these days, as never before, to prevent the 
conflict in Bosnia from growing into a European tragedy and 
deprive NATO of the right to determine when bombing and missile 
strikes in Bosnia should be carried out. 
  "It is essential urgently to look for new approaches to and 
ideas of a political settlement both in Bosnia and within a 
broader context in the Balkans. Such a decision should be taken 
at the level of, at least, the U.N. Security Council". 
  TRUD runs an interview with Professor Aleksandr Livshits, 
dr. 
of science (economics) and leader of the expert group to the 
Russian president. 
  Livshits, one of the main economic advisers to President 
Boris Yeltsin, said in particular that he sees it as the main 
task now "to make market reforms less burdensome for society 
without slowing down the reform process. The main thing is to 
ensure that the price of market reforms is not too great for 
society". 
  PRAVDA frontpages the text of Aleksandr Rutskoy's address to 
the people of Russia and to the members of the State Duma under 
the headline "There Can Be No Creative Endeavour Without Civil 
Peace". 
  The message says in particular that "in autumn last year all 
those, who were in the parliament building and manned the 
barricades, discharged their civil and patriotic duty to the 
end, upholding nascent parliamentarism, democracy and the 
constitution... For my part, I will do everything depending on 
me to perpetuate the lucid memory of those who perished..." 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the amnesty decision: 
  "The political amnesty story has once again pointed out the 
major flaw in our present-day democracy -- the inadequecy of the 
judicial branch of power. Will the judicial branch draw level 
with the other branches of power? Stability and accord in 
society depend on that in many respect". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA frontpages an interview with Mikhail 
Slinko, investigator of particularly important cases at the 
Moscow city prosecutor's office and the leader of a team of 
investigators probing charges of corruption brought up against 
Aleksandr Rutskoy in August last year. 
  Slinko said Rutskoy's signature on the documents, which were 
submitted to the investigators and which testified against the 
former vice-president, was forged. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA comments on a joint statement issued by 
Patriarch Aleksey II of Moscow and all Russia and Russian 
Defence Minister Pavel Grachev. In the statement the church and 
the army expressed readiness to cooperate for the benefit of the 
motherland. 
  The St. Petersburg-based newspaper VESTI reports that a 
monument to Finnish prisoners of war has been unveiled at 
Gatchina. According to data provided by Russian and Finnish 
historians, about 1,000 Finns died at Soviet P.O.W. camps during 
the Second World War. 
  The monument represents a shell-splinter piercing red 
granite 
symbolising the soldier's heart.

<F P=106> [By AZERTAJ correspondent Gekchekhanum Tagiyeva for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Baku March 3 TASS -- Azerbaijani Armed Forces are 
ready to cease fire to allow the diplomats to sit down at a 
negotiation table to find a peaceful solution to the conflict, 
the press service of the Azerbaijani Defence Ministry said in a 
statement on Thursday. 
  The statement said that "considering the fact of the arrival 
in Baku of the personal envoy of the Russian president, 
(Vladimir) Kazimirov, and Deputy Defence Minister (Georgiy) 
Kondratyev, as well as taking into account the ceasefire 
agreement in effect since March 1, the leadership of the 
Azerbaijani Armed Forces has issued an order to all units on the 
front line to cease fire and ignore provocations." 
  However, in the first few hours of ceasefire Azerbaijani 
positions came under intensive artillery shelling which also 
continued on March 2. "Today large forces of the Armenian Army 
launched a large-scale offensive supported by armoured vehicles 
in the southwest of the republic. This jeopardises Russia's 
mediating efforts," the statement said.

  [Text] The People's Front of Azerbaijan has denied 
allegations from the interior minister and prosecutor general of 
planning a military coup on March 5. Those accusations are 
groundless, Front leaders told Interfax in Baku on Thursday. The 
National Security Ministry has declined to comment on the 
statement made by the two government officials. 
  In the meantime, police searches are under way of the 
Front's 
headquarters in Baku, now into their fourth day. The measure 
comes after the police found military uniforms, ammunition and 
petrol bombs in the basement of the building. 
  But deputy Front leader Arif Aliyev said all of this had 
been 
deliberately put there to discredit his organization.

  [Text] Baku (March 3) TURAN -- Headquarter of the Popular 
[People's] Front is still under the control of armed policemen. 
All ins and outs of the building are kept under the control as 
well. The employees of the PFA [People's Front of Azerbaijan] 
can not work as they are not allowed to enter the building. 
  Deputy Chairman of the PFA, Asim Mollazadeh told Turan that 
"according to the law, after the search the police must leave 
the building and give us opportunity to perform our duties". 
According to Mollazadeh, yesterday, the Chief of police of Baku 
city told First Deputy Chairman of the PFA, Ibragim Ibragimli 
that not he but the leadership deals with this matter. 
  Judging by all, the authorities will confiscate the building 
of the Headquarter of the PFA. This morning there was no metal 
signboard "Popular Front of Azerbaijan" on the building.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Leskov: "Against the Wishes of Western </F>
Oil Giants, Russia Is Returning to Wells on the Caspian Shelf"] 
  [Text] The question of developing the Azeri and Shirak 
fields -- the richest on the territory of the former USSR, with 
reserves of more than 50 million tonnes of oil -- was agreed 
upon at the London meeting between President Geydar Aliyev of 
Azerbaijan and British Prime Minister John Major. So far it has 
been announced officially that a significant, 70-percent share 
in the development will be given to a Western consortium headed 
by British Petroleum. According to IZVESTIYA's exclusive 
information, however, the new government of Azerbaijan has 
confirmed its intention to grant the Russian oil company Lukoil 
a 12-percent share in the development. Lukoil has also secured 
approximately 10 percent from that part which now belongs to 
Azerbaijan. 
  An agreement to develop the Caspian shelf was earlier 
concluded with Western firms by the Elchibey government, and at 
that time no provision was made at all for Russia's 
participation. In the opinion of observers, the revision of the 
preliminary accords in Russia's favor attests to an attempt by 
Geydar Aliyev to enlist the support of his northern neighbor in 
resolving Azerbaijan's internal problems, including the Karabakh 
crisis. It cannot be ruled out that Azerbaijan will go still 
further in its concessions to Russia and will opt for 
transporting the oil not across Turkey as originally proposed, 
but through Novorossiysk and the "Friendship" pipeline. The 
unstable situation in Iranian Kurdistan, across whose territory 
the oil pipeline proposed by the Western side was to have 
passed, militates in favor of this decision. 
  According to preliminary information, another promising 
deposit at Gyunashlty might be taken away from the Western 
consortium altogether in favor of Lukoil. The final details of 
the agreement, which at present is being kept top secret, will 
be agreed during the 15 March visit to Baku by Lukoil President 
Vagit Alekperov. 
  Meanwhile a scandal is developing around a court action 
brought against Lukoil by the small Liechtenstein company of 
Frankenburg. The Lukoil leadership believes that the huge 
$550-million suit for breach of contract with regard to 
restoring wells in West Siberia has been provoked by Western 
competitors so as to compromise the Russian oil company at the 
moment of its entering the world market. In addition to 
Azerbaijan, Lukoil has penetrated the markets of Tunisia, Egypt, 
Nigeria, and Trinidad and Tobago. According to recent 
information received from Lukoil Vice President Leonid Fedun, 
Frankenburg has spent approximately $300,000-400,000 on a 
newspaper campaign over its suit. Strange though it may seem, 
the Estonian press stands out for being particularly active. As 
L. Fedun said, Frankenburg will endeavor to "fleece" Lukoil of 
approximately $10 million, but nothing will come of this venture. 
  To date the Southern District Court of the State of Texas, 
United States, with which the statement of claim has been 
lodged, has not accepted it for examination. The development of 
the court investigation has been hampered for legal reasons, 
above all. At the time of the conflict in 1992 Lukoil was a 
state company (the first check auction is only now being 
scheduled), and under U.S. legislation suits directed by private 
companies against the state property of other states may not be 
accepted for examination in the usual manner. Lukoil President 
Vagit Alekperov calls his former partner's claims ridiculous and 
expresses doubt that a court at any level will accept the 
scandalous case for examination. 
  In the macroeconomic sense the Russian oilmen's emergence 
onto the world market expresses a change in the strategy of the 
sector's development. The sales crisis in Russia and the huge 
nonpayments, which in 1993 exceeded 450 billion rubles for 
Lukoil alone, essentially leave the company with no other way 
out. So it cannot be ruled out that Lukoil will channel the 
considerable credits from Mitsui ($700 million) and the World 
Bank ($268 million) partly into developing its own business 
abroad. But the company's strategic goal of stabilizing Russian 
oil extraction by 1995 is not yet subject to revision.

  [Text] Moscow, February 22, RIA -- An agreement banning the 
dumping of radioactive and industrial waste in the seas came 
into force on February 21, 1994. It was signed by 70 countries. 
  Russia has, however, officially announced it is not going to 
join this agreement. 
  Sada Aksartova, a spokeswoman for the international 
ecological organisation Greenpeace, in commenting on the Russian 
Federation's stand, told a RIA correspondent it was a great 
mistake on the part of the Russian Government, and will evoke a 
highly negative response from the other countries. 
  Among the major powers, according to Aksartova, only 
Australia, in addition to Russia, has refused to accede to the 
agreement, "taking time-out" for two years.

<F P=106> [`Exclusive' interview with RMK, Republic of Mountainous </F>
Karabakh, Minister of Foreign Affairs Arkadiy Gukasyan by 
unidentified YERKIR correspondent on 25 February; place not 
given] 
  [Text] Stepanakert ("Yerkir" daily), 25/02/94-- 
[Correspondent] Along with the military operations activation at 
the borders, the peace-making efforts of different activated 
too. The most prominent are the efforts of Russia, which 
representative V. Kazimirov recently visited Stepanakert, 
Yerevan and Baku, and presented the new Russian initiative to 
the sides. What are the peculiarities of this project? Which 
topics of the initiative are particularly acceptable for the RMK 
[Republic of Mountainous Karabakh]? Are there topics which 
raise worries and may cause trouble in the future? 
  [Gukasyan] This is a very broad question which is rather 
difficult to answer at once. We can't state that there are too 
great differences between the initiatives of the CSCE and 
Russia. The most important difference for us is in the security 
mechanism presented in the Russian version. The unacceptable to 
us topics are those concerning Lachin and Shusha. Azerbaijan 
and Armenia didn't have the chance of working over the project. 
Such a meeting will be carried out in Moscow, but only after 
Kazimirov meets all the parties. We will meet in Moscow and 
will then start working on the text. 
  We are going to present our remarks and disagreements to V. 
Kazimirov before this meeting. Since Azerbaijan had more 
remarks (Azerbaijan wasn't prepared to this project and they in 
fact refused it), Russia suggested to stop the military 
operations for 2 weeks to work out the text of the agreement. 
Nevertheless, Azerbaijan refused this proposal too. 
  [Correspondent] Such a categorical position of Azerbaijan 
lets us suppose that we shouldn't expect too many changes and 
this may be a dead end. 
  [Gukasyan] No, I wouldn't say so. Azerbaijan only hoped to 
achieve military success during these two months, and this would 
have created favorable conditions for them during the 
negotiations. But Azerbaijan was unable to reach this goal and 
is now trying to save time again. If the Azeri leaders accept 
the Russian initiative and agree to cease the fire, they must 
account to their people since they lost some 7-8 thousand 
fighters during these two months with no results. It seems to 
me, this is a military measure. But if Azerbaijan was 
successful, nothing could stop them anymore. 
  [Correspondent] Maybe such a position of Azerbaijan could be 
explained by certain guarantees they receive from several 
countries? Do you think to be a mere chance that mercenaries 
from a number of countries are serving in the Azeri Army, the 
army is armed by Turkish and Chinese weapons? Several reports 
appeared in British press regarding military support to 
Azerbaijan. Participation of Afghan mojahedins is well 
documented. This means internationalization of the problem. 
  [Gukasyan] Surely, participation of other countries is not a 
secret, and we have facts. Regarding the internationalization 
of the conflict--to say frankly, I doubt if Azerbaijan is 
currently interested in this, but a moment will come when they 
will take this step. We are fighting against a coalition today. 
Turks, Afghans, Russians, Ukrainians etc. are fighting in the 
Azeri Army. 
  [Correspondent] Do you think, that in the conditions when 
the 
Azeri attacks failed in fact, the cease fire is appropriate for 
us? Are there mechanisms which will disallow Azerbaijan to use 
this cease fire for preparing a new even more powerful attack? 
  [Gukasyan] There are no and there could be no 100 percent 
guarantees. We are always worried by this. We support the 
peace course but we worry for Azerbaijan may be using the cease 
fire for war preparations indeed. Nobody is giving any 
guarantees to us. Everybody understands, there is a risk 
factor. Unfortunately there are no such guarantee mechanisms. 
The best mechanism would be to recognize the independence of 
the RMK, and we would become a subject of the international law. 
This is not quite possible today. The other possibility is: 
the peace keeping forces of the United Nations or Russia could 
serve as such a mechanism. But this is dangerous too. We have 
seen the Safonov's [military commandant in Karabakh in early 
1990] regime. On the other hand, we should not allow this war 
to last, not to turn into a war of resources. 
  [Correspondent] What about the position of the RA President, 
according to which the only acceptable version of the conflict's 
peaceful regulation is an immediate stop of military operations 
without verification of the RMK status, followed by long-lasting 
negotiations which may last for decades, probably? To what 
extent does this concern the interests and the external policy 
of the RMK? 
  [Gukasyan] There are different approaches to this freezing 
of 
military operations. In our opinion, it would be more correct 
if the military operations were frozen at the current 
conditions. This means freezing the military operations without 
any preconditions. Freezing followed by negotiations--even maybe 
long-lasting ones. This will be very difficult to implement 
though, since all the mediators are suggesting the condition of 
withdrawing the troops from all the territories as the next 
step. This is a very dangerous precondition for us, since we 
can't see the perspective. Say, we withdrew the forces, and 
what then? 
  [Correspondent] Can we possibly use the version "territories 
against the peace and status", which was widely used in the 
world history? 
  [Gukasyan] We have been always suggesting this version. This 
is our main demand. But the world doesn't accept this. They 
say "we can understand when you say `peace against territories', 
but we can't understand when you demand the status". We tried 
to explain that we also mean the status when talking peace, 
since there will be no peace otherwise. In other words, what 
peace can we expect if there are no other guarantees? We have 
always stressed, that our goal is not the temporary fire 
cessation. We need guarantees for this to result in a lasting 
peace. It's not too easy to talk on this now, as Azerbaijan 
talks not only about the Fizuli but also Shusha and Lachin as 
well. This is not acceptable for us. Remarkably, Azeri demands 
rise when they hope to break our defense by means of force. 
  [Correspondent] You represented the RMK in almost all 
official and unofficial meetings concerning the Artsakh problem. 
In your personal opinion, do you think there is a shift in the 
understanding of the problem by international community and the 
mediators? 
  [Gukasyan] Surely, there are changes. We are working within 
the CSCE framework for more than a year and a half. And many 
things changed during this period. Everybody is admitting 
Karabakh as a conflicting side now. We were considered just as 
the representatives of an organization at the beginning, but now 
we are considered quite seriously and no proposals are made 
without consulting with us. 
  [Correspondent] Can we state that the representatives of RMK 
are no more considered as the representatives of the Armenian 
community of Mountainous Karabakh in international organizations? 
  [Gukasyan] Yes, of course. Everybody understands this way, 
and we are admitted as the leaders of Mountainous Karabakh, in 
spite of Turkish and Azeri struggle against this notion. 
  [Correspondent] Do you think, that recognition of the RMK by 
Armenia now or at an earlier stage could support the 
international recognition of the RMK independence? 
  [Gukasyan] This is hard to tell. Armenia will recognize 
the RMK soon or late. May be it's not the proper moment now. I 
don't believe that recognition of the RMK by Armenia now will 
immediately bring political dividends, or something will change 
today resulting from that. This might even make the situation 
worse. I am not sure. 
  [Correspondent] The world politics seems to be searching for 
common edges in Karabakh, Abkhazian and Bosnian conflicts. The 
world seemingly tends to be looking for a universal solution. 
In your opinion, in what extent are these conflicts similar? 
  [Gukasyan] They are similar and they are not at the same 
time. I don't think a universal solution may be found for these. 
A universal approach is possible though these are quite 
different problems. We should find a model for resolving these 
problems... 
  [Correspondent] One of the discussed suggestions is the 
model 
of a confederative state. This model is based on mutual 
concessions and satisfies the right for independence and 
inviolability of borders both. In this regard, is the 
RMK-Azerbaijan confederation acceptable for the RMK? Does this 
meet the interests of Artsakh? 
  [Gukasyan] It's too early to talk on this now. I don't 
believe if there could be found a single Karabakh citizen, who 
would agree for Karabakh to remain within Azerbaijan by any 
means. But it seems to me, if serious work starts in this 
direction, we'll participate in it. Only cultural independence 
is meant now. If confederative problems start being discussed, 
we may start working on such a project. But Azerbaijan is not 
willing to talk even on creating a federation, and the world 
(the CSCE or Russia) is not ready to talk even on Azeri 
federation. They talk on confederation in Bosnia, on federation 
in Georgia but nothing is said regarding the Karabakh problem. 
  [Correspondent] Is there any increased activity after the 
new 
CSCE Chairman was assigned? 
  [Gukasyan] Yes, in some sense. The style of their search for 
a solution of the conflict has changed at least. The CSCE 
course in fact didn't advance at all in 2 years. They now 
decided, as far as I understand, to carry out the works in 
Karabakh, Armenia and Azerbaijan instead of working in Rome, 
Paris, Vienna and other European cities as formerly. 
  [Correspondent] What about the placement of the CSCE 
observers at the RMK-Azeri and Armenian-Azeri borders? Can this 
be the guarantee for a stable fire cessation? 
  [Gukasyan] I don't believe that the observers may guarantee 
the cease fire without the peace-keeping forces. But the 
presence of the observers is very important. This is a part of 
the guarantees, but the observers should not be from Turkey. 
They must be from a neutral country. The Russian troops can 
play role of peace-keeping forces.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the "Press Center of the Embassy of the </F>
Islamic Republic of Iran in Yerevan;" date not given] 
  [Text] Yerevan ("YERKIR" daily), 18/02/94 -- "There has 
been information spread recently that Azeri airforce is using 
the air territory of the Iranian Republic for attacking the 
territory of the Republic of Armenia. The Islamic Republic of 
Iran is well aware of the sources of such information. 
  The embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran would like to 
stress once again its neutral position regarding the Karabakh 
conflict and strictly rejects such baseless declarations which 
are aiming to aggravate the crisis and therefore to 
internationalize the conflict. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran is consistent in its external 
policy and is trying to support the peace course from the very 
beginning of the Karabakh conflict. Meanwhile it keeps the 
right to take strict measures if any of the conflicting sides 
violates the borders of the republic. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran considered one of the main 
topics of its external policy to be in friendly relations with 
all its neighbors including the Republic of Armenia. The people 
of Armenia and Iran have a good history of friendship and 
coexistence. By this very reason after the official relations 
between the two countries have been restored, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran has been taking all efforts to further improve 
these links and relations. Therefore the provocative news of 
this kind based on the principle of separating and ruling are 
will not create any obstacles in the relations between the two 
countries.

  [Text] Stepanakert ("LRAGIR" daily), 24/02/94 -- The 
tension at the Karabakh fronts slightly decreased. The 
conflicting sides refrained from active military operations and 
have been carrying positional battles only. 
  According to the headquarters of the RMK [Republic of 
Mountainous Karabakh] Defense Army, no significant changes were 
reported yesterday along the whole front line. The units of 
Azeri Army only shelled the defense positions of the Karabakh 
army from mortars and large caliber machine guns. No victims. 
  The situation in Kelbadzharskiy district is also rather 
calm. 
The Omar gorge is completely controlled by the Armenian units. 
  According to the reconnaissance and the military 
specialists, 
increasing cases of desertion are reported in the Azeri Army. 
  Reliable sources informed us, that the current reserves of 
Azeri army only make 12,000 soldiers. According to the 
specialists, no serious military tasks can be resolved by such 
forces. 
  We also found out, that some officers of the army of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran are fighting in the Azeri Army 
additionally to Afghan mojahedins and slavic mercenaries. One 
of the Iranian officers was captured as a prisoner of war by the 
Karabakh forces. The captured officer participated in the 
Iran-Iraq conflict in time.

  [Text] Yerevan ("Lragir", "Azg", "Yerkir" dailies), 
03/03/94 -- The railway bridge over the river Khram in the 
Marneuliskiy district of Georgia was exploded at 4am in the 
morning of March 2 as a result of a terrorist action. 
  RA [Republic of Armenia] Governmental press service informed 
us, the main railway bridge was damaged after the first 
explosion in December, 1993. A new temporary bridge was built 
nearby, allowing transfer of trains over the bridge. One of the 
supporting blocks of the new bridge has been damaged as a result 
of the new explosion. 
  The RA Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan promised to deliver 
the 
grain and fuel to Armenia by air. Meanwhile the Minister of 
Food and Resources David Zadoyan reported, trucks were sent to 
Georgia for delivering the cargoes (particularly grain). The 
reconstruction of the bridge will take 20-25 days at least, Mr. 
Zadoyan reported. 
  The Armenian specialists left to the place of the explosion. 
According to the official report, the reconstruction time will 
be only known after investigating the situation on the spot. 
  This is fifth explosion at the railway, connecting Armenia 
with the external world, during this winter. And therefore the 
declarations of the Georgian parliamentarian Aleksandr Kavasadze 
about "brotherly relations" between Armenia and Georgia, made on 
March 1, sound rather strange. 
  Meanwhile the Yerevan-Tbilisi highway is being used starting 
from March 2. The non-stable situation in Georgia didn't allow 
to use this road before. The main difficulty is to ensure the 
security in the Marneuli-Tbilisi section, which is now 
guaranteed.

  [Text] Azeri military police units on Thursday [3 March] 
blocked the approaches to the village of Keleki in Nakhichevan 
where ex-president Abulfaz Elchibey is staying. Former state 
secretary [Ali] Karimov told Interfax that armed units of the 
New Azerbaijan party, which as we know is headed by the current 
leader President Heydar Aliyev, were also involved in the 
operation. Karimov said "a punitive operation designed as a 
reprisal against Abulfaz Elchibey could start any moment now".

<F P=106> [From the "Military Courier" program] </F>
  [Text] The functions of the CIS Defense Ministers' Council 
have been changed. It now becomes the main consultative body on 
military matters of the Collective Security Council. 
  [Aleksandr Ostrovskiy] The session of CIS defense ministers 
considered the formulation of the Council and the organization 
of its activities. It is proposed that it consist of 250 
individuals, half of whom will be from the Russian Defense 
Ministry. The main form for the work of the Defense Ministers' 
Council will be its sessions, which will be held at least once 
every three months. 
  The session also considered one of the main issues -- the 
Tajik-Afghan border -- since the armed provocations against 
Russian border guards have taken on the form of continual combat 
actions. Since the start of the year alone there have been 
intensive rocket bombardments on 21 occasions. [Video shows 
brief interviews] 
  [Tajik Defense Minister A. Shishlyannikov] There are 
continual incidents, including attempts to break through and 
attempted armed provocations, but at least for the present they 
are all being successfully repelled. 
  [Russian Deputy Defense Minister B. Gromov] I think that 
under no circumstance should we forget our experience within the 
Warsaw Pact. You rightly mentioned the matter of interaction 
and other things and ensuring military-technical cooperation. 
That is to say, it applies to all aspects. 
  [L.Ivashov, secretary of the CIS Defense Ministers' Council] 
At present the discussion has been solely about the CIS 
coordinating bodies, namely the Defense Ministers' Council and 
the headquarters for the coordination of military cooperation. 
Naturally a whole range of other issues will also be considered. 
  [Ostrovskiy] The first step has been taken. What will the 
second step be? 
  [Ivashov] As a second step we hope that Gennadiy Ivanovich 
Shabannikov, general secretary of the Collective Security 
Council, will present the Collective Security Council with 
specific proposals for formulating a model for collective 
security, and forming the structures of the treaty member 
states, and some kind of plan for the stage by stage creation of 
the system.

  [Text] The strengthening of the CIS will be to a great 
extent defining the fate of millions of Russians living in the 
Commonwealth countries. Only integration within the framework 
of the Commonwealth can assuage the controversy around the 
problems of the Russian-speaking population in the "near 
abroad", the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's department 
for CIS affairs Leonid Drachevskiy stated in Moscow on Friday. 
He spoke at a seminar on the problems of the Russian-speaking 
population in "the near abroad" organized by the Russian Foreign 
Ministry. 
  In the diplomat's opinion, "it is necessary to accelerate 
the 
implementation of the treaty on economic union." 
"Unfortunately, many of the agreements attached to that treaty 
are not working. The problem is that they were concluded 
sporadically. As a result, their implementation was not carried 
out in stages as required", he noted. 
  Drachevskiy also spoke in favor of "intensifying" work on 
the 
creation of a collective security system. "Obviously, the 
borders within the Commonwealth should be transparent. Only 
outer frontiers of the CIS should be thoroughly guarded. So far 
we have signed such agreements only with Central Asian 
republics," he said. 
  Drachevskiy particularly noted that negotiations with the 
CIS 
countries on dual citizenship "regularly get into impasse." 
"Many experts justifiably believe that in our conditions dual 
citizenship generates more questions, than answers. Obviously, 
it would be reasonable to consider some intermediate option 
envisaging "special regime of citizenship" within the CIS. This 
means that a citizen of one state would not be considered as a 
foreigner on the territory of other state, but would have all 
rights with small "exception", for example, the right to vote", 
the diplomat pointed out. 
  He expressed confidence that these steps would "have a 
positive influence on the plight of Russians living in the near 
abroad." 
  The strategic task of Russia is "to keep all Euroasian 
territory of the former Soviet Union if not under control, then 
under strong influence." This opinion was expressed by a 
representative of the association for ties with foreign 
compatriots "Russkiye Zoriy" Gennadiy Mozhayev who spoke at the 
seminar. 
  In his view, the 21st century will be come "a century of 
fighting for energy sources." "That is why the preservation of 
its influence on the territory of the former Soviet Union is a 
vitally important task for Russia. From this point of view it's 
an advantage for us to have a big number of Russians in the near 
abroad", he said. 
  Mozhayev also spoke in favor of setting up an All-Russian 
state foundation on support of Russians living in the CIS 
countries. 
  Russia's senior adviser at the United Nations in New York 
Aleksandr Denisov, a spokesman for the Congress of Russian 
Communities has said that "not only CIS but the Baltic states 
are a zone of special political, military and strategic 
interests for Russia." 
  There can be no talk "about any migration of ethnic Russians 
from CIS countries. The Russians must stay wherever they are 
historically strong and should be only economically supported", 
Denisov said. 
  In his opinion, the emerging Russian business is "a rather 
effective means for Russia to gain a foothold in CIS states." 
As an example, Denisov cited the fact that about 80% of 
entrepreneurs in Lithuania are Russians. "In other countries, 
the situation is similar. This potential need to be tapped", he 
stressed. 
  Whatever happens, Russia must not allow "politicizing of its 
communities in the CIS." Such an opinion has been voiced by 
Russia's ex Foreign Minister Shelov-Kovedyayev, a co-chairman of 
"The Russian Club", an international non-governmental 
organization. 
  "To employ these people for gaining influence as a "fifth 
column" is not only corrupt and inhumane but dangerous for them, 
as we know from world history", he stressed. 
  According to Shelov-Kovedyayev, one of the main problems, 
facing the Russians in the CIS is the economic one. So, they 
should be supported in every way to forestall their massive 
migration. That would be much cheaper than to accommodate 
millions of resettlers in Russia.

<F P=106> [Liana Minasyan report in the "Diaspora" column: "Russians </F>
in the CIS Are Not Foreigners. Russian Federation Foreign 
Affairs Ministry Has Held a Conference on Problems of the 
Commonwealth's Russophones"] 
  [Text] The range of opinions (including in Russia's state 
structures) on how Moscow's relations with the newly independent 
neighboring countries should develop is very wide -- from 
isolationism to unification at any price. But in this context 
the problem of "ethnic Russians" in the CIS countries is 
perennial. In an attempt to define their legal status, the 
Russian Federation Foreign Ministry has proposed a draft 
bilateral treaty between the Russian Federation and a 
corresponding state related to "Russian Federation citizens 
permanently residing on its territory." The treaty proposes 
that a status be established for them close to the legal status 
of that country's citizens in as much as refers to political, 
economic, and other rights. With very few exceptions -- for 
instance the right to elect and be elected to supreme bodies of 
state power, participate in referendums, and hold diplomatic or 
state security posts -- the "permanent residents" have equal 
rights with the country's citizens and the restrictions imposed 
on foreigners do not extend to them. 
  The appearance of such a draft, in the opinion of Moscow 
diplomats, is due to the fact that a different status -- say, 
dual citizenship -- creates more problems than its solves. At 
the same time the special citizenship status proposed by them is 
not based on ethnic principles, but enables anyone having any 
even very remote roots in Russia to register his citizenship 
according to a simplified procedure. In particular this setup 
is designed to remove certain problems for re-emigres from the 
CIS countries who are often treated in Russia as foreigners. 
Without recognizing dual citizenship juridically, the Russian 
authorities may do this de facto. 
  True, this agreement, speakers at the conference noted, 
leaves out people who move from the "inner neighboring states" 
[vnutrenneye zarubezhye], in particular Russians who leave the 
Russian Federation's ethnic republics. 
  One of the acute issues is still the character of influence 
on Russian communities in the newly independent states by 
numerous public organizations created in Russia to maintain 
links with compatriots abroad. To politicize the public life of 
the Russian diaspora and to turn the community into a conduit of 
Russian policy abroad would mean, as was stressed at the 
conference, to subject it to additional danger, leading to 
extreme situations -- "knowing some traditions that can reemerge 
in certain regions." 
  At present, social problems in Russia for compatriots from 
the neighboring states have been alleviated somewhat after the 
free circulation of foreign exchange, which they often had to 
pay for their presence in their "historical motherland," was 
banned here. It was also proposed to allow them to enroll in 
Russian colleges and universities on a general competitive basis 
and to promote the dissemination of Russian newspapers and books 
in the Commonwealth countries. At the interstate level, that 
the extension of credits to CIS countries be made contingent on 
which proportion thereof will be used to support and promote the 
Russian diaspora, also taking into account the number of 
Russians leaving the country.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  Moscow March 5 (ITAR-TASS) -- Moscow leading newspapers 
concentrate on the speeches by President Boris Yeltsin and 
Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin at the government's enlarged meeting 
on Friday. 
  The ROSSIISKIE VESTI Newspaper features a commentary on 
these 
speeches headlined "to find reasonable correlation between speed 
of reforms and real social price for it." "Let us put it 
bluntly: the government does not suggest any backtrack from the 
previous policy," the newspaper stresses. 
  "The strategic course for creating an effective market 
economy must be preserved, but the task of cutting social price 
for reforms moves to the foreground at this stage." At the same 
time, the newspaper criticises the federal budget of the Finance 
Ministry, which was approved, in principle, by a meeting of the 
government, expressing doubts at "feasibility" of some of its 
indicators for 1994. 
  The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper writes in the same vein, 
noting that the budget was adopted with "a black hole." The 
newspaper's commentary claims that "the pumping of worthless 
money into the economy will not check the slump (of production). 
It will only destroy the consumer market which has just 
emerged. Then, there will be the only way out -- a state of 
emergency. This way of developments is not the worst one." 
  The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper carries a summary of the above 
speeches under the headline "President's State of the Nation 
Message to Russian Parliament is Platform for Accord." 
  It singles out Yeltsin's words that, following the message, 
"long-awaited outlines of a general approach to tackling 
economic problems" start emerging and that consequences of the 
political amnesty adopted by the lower chamber of parliament on 
ringleaders of abortive coups in August 1991 and October 1993 
are fraught with the danger of new confrontation. 
  A commentary on the amnesty written by A. Golts and 
published 
by the same newspaper claims that the release of the Lefortovo 
prison inmates "is no threat to political stability." 
  Giving a summary of the president's and premier's speeches, 
the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper stresses that "Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's report absorbed the best economic goals." 
  But it is not quite clear, the newspaper adds, whether the 
present government can realise them. A series of extracts from 
Yeltsin's speech published by the newspaper starts with the 
following words: "I fully understand how contraversial the 
decision (on political amnesty) taken by the lower house is and 
how hastily it was carried out." 
  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIA (opposition newspaper) gives a digest of 
+the report on social and economic situation in Russia compiled 
by the Russian Statistics Committee, which was circulated in the 
Kremlin among participants in the enlarged meeting of the 
government. Its data on the continued slump of the Gross 
Domestic Product in Russia are described with one word 
"evalanche." 
  The PRAVDA newspaper carries an interview with Radovan 
Karadzic, leader of Bosnian Serbs and vice-president of the 
Union of Serb Writers. 
  Russia's initiative to settle the conflict in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, he says, "helped to overcome confrontation with 
NATO, and Russia, I believe, entered, thanks to this, the world 
political arena as an independent force which should be reckoned 
with." "We experience an unusual inthusiasm and gratitude for 
what Russia has done for Serbia," he added. 
  The trud newspaper features the last part of the memoirs by 
former commander of the Soviet Navy Nikolai Kuznetsov who 
personally knew Stalin, under the headline "Stalin's Death." 
  The PRAVDA newspaper prints a photograph from the front 
cover 
of the West German Magazine SPIEGEL with the inscription 
"Stalin's Second Death," depicting him together with Vladimir 
Lenin inside the mausoleum (magazine's correspondent used a 
hidden photo camera to take a snapshot). 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Deputy 
Prosecutor- General Vladimir Kravtsov, saying that he "has no 
doubts about guilt of Khasbulatov, Rutskoy and their aides." 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA devotes an article to the world's first 
cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin who would have turned 60 on March 9.

  [Excerpts] At the Republic of Belarus Supreme Soviet 
session discussion continued on articles of the draft new 
constitution of Belarus. Agreement was reached that proposals 
for making amendments to the Constitution may be considered by 
the Supreme Soviet only in the event of their initiators being 
the president, 40 people's deputies, or 150,000 citizens of the 
Republic. The deputies also voted unanimously in favor of an 
article providing for equal elections, in which all voters have 
an identical number of votes and an approximately equal number 
of citizens live in each constituency. [passage omitted] 
  Thus, the new Constitution of the Republic of Belarus was 
passed article by article. However, an attempt to pass, in its 
first reading, a draft law on the introduction of the 
Constitution into operation did not obtain the support of the 
majority of deputies. 
  A draft law on the national archives was passed in its first 
reading, and amendments and changes to the civil code of the 
Republic of Belarus were considered. With this the session 
adjourned its work until 15 March.

TASS] 
  [Text] Minsk 4 Mar, TASS -- "The Supreme Soviet's decision 
to introduce the institution of the presidency in our country is 
a symbol that our republic is becoming a real state," announced 
Belarusian Parliamentary Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb on Friday at a 
meeting with activists from the Women's Movement. "And the 
adoption of a new Constitution will strengthen society's 
movement towards a socially-orientated democratic system," he 
said. 
  The speaker of the Belarusian parliament emphasized that the 
deputies' determination to resolve the country's political 
problems in a constitutional way is in the interests of the 
people, who are tired of the constant meetings charged up by 
leaders of individual parties. 
  "The path of government reorganization marked by the Supreme 
Soviet is the most constructive: Presidential elections are to 
be announced, representing the popular choice of the state's 
head, and then parliamentary elections. All this will not lead 
to a power vacuum," Hryb noted. "At the same time, the 
opposition is proposing a diametrically opposed movement towards 
social reconciliation: The disbanding of the Supreme Soviet, 
early elections for new deputies, the adoption by the latter of 
a new constitution, and only then the election of the president. 
That drawn-out and very expensive project will inevitably lead 
to a social explosion under conditions of an disbalanced 
economy. That it exactly what we are trying to avoid," the 
Supreme Soviet chairman announced.

  [Text] As of yesterday, gas supplies to our republic from 
Russia were reduced by 10 million cubic meters. Such is the 
volume of gas cut down by the Russian joint stock company 
"Gazprom" due to late payments. Mikalay Macharnyuk, general 
director of the Belarusian state enterprise for transportation 
and supply of gas "Beltransgaz," told BELINFORM that this 
[reduction] was announced in a telegram. The telegram also 
warned against a full cut of supplies because the Republic has 
not paid about 50 billion Russian rubles for fuel. All possible 
measures to repay debts are now being adopted. In connection 
with this, the Council of Ministers held a session which 
discussed ways out of the crisis. One of the ways is, first of 
all, the urgent payoff of debts by direct consumers of the blue 
fuel -- industrial enterprises. This question must also be 
worked out by the National Bank.

  [Text] The Belarus Government today found 31 billion rubles 
to service its debt to Russia for its gas and oil, which, as is 
known, exceeds 400 billion rubles. The Republican Government is 
prepared to apply compulsory measures to those Belarus companies 
that owe Russia, said Mikhail Myasnikov, the first deputy 
chairman of the Council of Ministers. In the deputy prime 
minister's words, the Belarus Government will do everything 
possible to clear the major part of its debt to Russia in the 
near future.

  [Text] Minsk 5 Mar, TASS -- Belarus will receive today 20 
million cubic metres of gas less than usual, a spokesman for the 
Beltransgaz state enterprise, which controls the transportation 
and delivery of gas, told Belinform. Its senior executives said 
that the decision of the Gazprom joint stock company on reducing 
gas deliveries "can hardly be described as groundless," because 
Belarusian enterprises are consuming gas, but are in no hurry to 
pay for it. 
  The Belarusian council of ministers "outlined various 
measures for paying the debts, Belinform was told at 
Beltransgaz. Some 30 billion roubles have already been 
transferred to the account of Gazprom. The money was raised 
with the help of the Ministry of Finance, the National Bank and 
auctions at stock exchanges," the Beltransgaz spokesman said.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Vyacheslav Kevorkov and </F>
Gennadiy Kulbitskiy] 
  [Text] Bonn, 3 Mar -- "We regard our visit to the FRG as 
very important and we hope that it will help to activate 
economic cooperation and give renewed impetus to the political 
dialogue between the leadership of the two countries." This was 
stated today in an exclusive interview given to the ITAR-TASS 
correspondents by Pyotr Krawchanka, Belarus foreign minister, 
who is on an official visit to the FRG. 
  The signing took place in Bonn today of two important 
documents -- an agreement on cooperation in the sphere of 
culture and also a memorandum on cooperation in alleviating the 
consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. "At the present time," 
the head of Belarus' foreign policy department continued, "we 
have begun work on preparing further accords, which will be 
signed during forthcoming visits at a higher level." 
  "The Belarus side is satisfied with the level of development 
of relations with the Federal Republic of Germany. At least 
they look more solid than those with any other Western European 
country: We have credits and joint enterprises. Germany is our 
number one partner among Western countries; it occupies first 
place in our exports and imports. Today we can state that 
Germany takes its obligations to Belarus very seriously. The 
fact that half the government guarantees for goods deliveries 
and credits for our country is equal to the whole credit 
allocated to Ukraine -- totaling 300 million German marks -- 
shows that the Germans' intentions are serious. 
  The minister was asked a question about the Belarusian 
leadership's attitude to the Partnership for Peace program 
approved recently by NATO. "On the whole, we are positive about 
this idea. It will be discussed in the Belarus Security Council 
and in the Belarusian parliament, after which Belarus' official 
position will be drawn up," he said. 
  Stressing that considerable attention was paid to 
disarmament 
problems during his discussion with German Foreign Minister K. 
Kinkel, the minister pointed out that "under its international 
obligations, Belarus is due to destroy at least 2,000 tanks, 
1,650 APC's, and 150 aircraft. The number of tanks to be 
destroyed is the highest in Europe. These tanks do not belong 
to us, yet it is we who must destroy them. This is why we need 
technological and financial assistance now. In particular, it 
is well-known that this process requires a large quantity of 
energy." 
  Answering a question from the ITAR-TASS correspondent about 
the Belarusian leadership's attitude to Gazprom's decision to 
reduce gas deliveries beginning today [3 March], the Belarusian 
foreign minister said, "I think this issue is not political, but 
economic. After all, we have signed a preliminary agreement with 
Gazprom to set up a unified Russian-Belarusian joint-stock 
company, and we expect that Russia will sell us gas not at 
contract prices, but at the prices charged on the domestic 
Russian market." 
  The Belarusian foreign minister's visit to Germany lasts 
until 5 March.

  [Text] Bonn 4 Mar, TASS -- "I think Belarus will integrate 
with the European Union after 2005 and recognize all values of 
the Maastricht agreements. I am strongly convinced of that," 
Belarusian Foreign Minister Pyotr Krawchenko, currently here on 
an official visit, told ITAR-TASS today. 
  Speaking of results of his Bonn negotiations, Krawchenko 
said 
"the visit has been prepared for over a year and very 
thoroughly. We have signed two very important documents in Bonn, 
including the memorandum on interaction in overcoming Chernobyl 
consequences. 
  "Belarus is the first state to conclude such an agreement 
with a leading European nation. Paradoxically, many countries 
avoided cooperation on the issue at the interstate level. This 
memorandum is the first document of the sort. In fact, charity 
exceeded the assistance Belarus received through state channels. 
Germany is the leader in this respect, 40 per cent of charity 
aid is its." 
  Asked about 1994 meetings between German and Belarusian 
leaders, Krawchenko stressed "we have discussed a possibility of 
German visit of Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich. I 
hope the visit will be held in 1994. Its precise date has not 
been specified as Germany is expected to have 19 elections, 
including parliamentary, this year. It will be hard to find 
time for the visit in the near future."

  [Text] A sharp cutting down of military production is 
taking place in Belarus, First Deputy Defense Minister Alexander 
Tushinsky declared speaking at the session of the board of 
Belarus' Defense Ministry. In his words, "last year these rates 
reduced by 65-70 percent compared with 1991." 
  As Tushinsky asserts, due to an uncontrolled growth of 
prices 
for raw materials and fuel and energy, growth of salary, and 
other factors, cost value of production has increased. As many 
as 24,800 highly qualified experts (12.9 percent) discharged 
from defense enterprises, 8200 people -- from military research 
institutes and design bureaus, he reported. As he said, "there 
has occurred decrease of traditional markets to sell this 
products due to their high price and reduction of demand for 
military products and military orders." 
  According to the first deputy minister, these circumstances 
"have forced many enterprises to stop or cut down production and 
compensate the losses producing civil products at the expense of 
irrational reorientation of industrial capacity. In 1988-92 14 
industrial enterprises have entirely stopped production of 
special products," pointed out Tushinsky.

workers. The full text of the general agreement will be 
published in the press.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report based on BNS (expansion unknown) </F>
materials under the "Inquiry" rubric: "A Traitor Has Sneaked 
Into the Lithuanian Security Service. Prosecutor's Office 
Promises To Expose Him"] 
  [Text] The Lithuanian Prosecutor's Office plans to conduct 
"a thorough investigation" to find out who was responsible for 
the failure of the operation to detain Vitaliy Yegorov, former 
Soviet serviceman, who was charged with anti-state activity in 
Klaipeda during the August 1991 coup attempt. At the time, 
Colonel Yegorov was chief of the military-political department 
of the USSR Coast Guard Division deployed in the city. The 
Lithuanian Prosecutor's Office has evidence proving that it was 
at his initiative that the Soviet military in Klaipeda announced 
their assumption of authority and demanded that State of 
Emergency Committee edicts be adhered to during the August coup 
plot. This is why Yegorov has long been wanted and a warrant to 
arrest him has been issued. 
  It was planned to detain the suspect last Friday in his 
apartment in Klaipeda, where his wife and children live, but to 
all appearances he was warned in advance about the upcoming 
action and fled. 
  "This is an outright sellout by a staffer of the National 
Security Service," Kiastutis Biatingis, chief prosecutor from 
the department for the investigation of state crimes, said in an 
interview for the RESPUBLIKA newspaper. "It is possible that 
Yegorov was detained on Friday, but he may have been released 
later. He may also have been warned in advance about the 
upcoming operation. To all appearances, someone did that 
deliberately." 
  According to Biatingis, the Lithuanian National Security 
Service was the sole agency tasked with carrying out the 
operation to detain Vitaliy Yegorov. He said that he would 
officially demand that security service staffers who failed to 
perform their duties be discharged. 
  A shadow of suspicion also falls on National Security 
Service 
chief Jurgis Jurgialis himself. Lithuanian General Prosecutor 
Arturas Paulauskas said that in the last few days before the 
operation, Jurgialis had called him a number of times and argued 
insistently that the former Soviet serviceman should not be 
detained because this action would look politically dubious. As 
a result, Mr. Jurgialis has been missing at his work place since 
28 February. According to his secretary, he has the flu.

  [Text] On 7 March 1994, Romania's President Ion Iliescu 
will begin an official two-day visit to Lithuania. Prior to 
this visit, our radio station had an interview with Lithuania's 
President Algirdas Brazauskas, who, from the very beginning, 
expressed his belief that the relations between his country and 
Romania must be more dynamic. 
  Mr. Brazauskas viewed the visit of the head of the Romanian 
state to Vilnius as a good opportunity to get first-hand 
information about the situation in the two countries and to 
exchange opinions about their efforts aimed at European 
integration, in the European structures of collective security. 
  The Lithuanian president reasserted that our countries were 
the first ones that signed the Partnership for Peace accord in 
Brussels at the end of January. 
  The basic political treaty between Lithuania and Romania 
that 
will be signed in Vilnius will elevate the bilateral relations 
to a higher level, Mr. Brazauskas mentioned and added that so 
far, no broad cooperation plans have been achieved, but such 
intentions might be favored by the signing of the treaty. 
  In this respect, the Lithuanian president mentioned the 
interest of his country in building a north-south highway, which 
will be called Via-Baltica and will cross Romania. 
  Our country that is neighboring the Black Sea and Lithuania 
neighboring the Baltic Sea also have mutual interests in making 
appropriate use of harbors and ensuring maritime access from 
both countries to those harbors . 
  Such issues will be discussed during the meeting of the two 
heads of state as well as during discussions that will be held 
between the Romanian delegation and Lithuanian experts, 
Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas said in the interview 
he granted to Bucharest Radio station.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "How Much and What Type of Army Does </F>
Lithuania Need?"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the State Defense Council held its 
meeting chaired by the president. The meeting discussed the 
possibilities of producing military equipment in Lithuania. A 
decision was adopted to coordinate all issues with Latvia and 
Estonia, and to set up a special working group to analyze the 
possibilities of its own production and assess its economic 
basis. 
  As V. Petkevicius, chairman of the Seimas [parliament] 
National Security Committee, reported to RESPUBLIKA, alongside 
these problems, the meeting also dealt with technical matters in 
deploying the Army and the issue of control over the airspace. 
RESPUBLIKA found out that the problem of the establishment of a 
peacekeeping battalion was postponed for another meeting which 
will, probably, be held on 7-14 March. According to V. 
Petkevicius, the "Partnership for Peace" agreement does not 
oblige a single country to form peacekeeping battalions or 
corps. Preliminary estimations show that the establishment of 
such a battalion or a corps would require about $30 and $10-12 
million, respectively. The Defense Council also had to consider 
the manner in which European standards must be applied to the 
Lithuanian Army. In V. Petkevicius' opinion, first of well, 
Lithuania should decide how much and what type of Army it needs. 
The military could claim 5 percent of the national budget at 
best. Unfortunately, the purchase of fighters will have to be 
abandoned, to say nothing of luxury cars for the National 
Defense Ministry. According to V. Petkevicius, fighters in 
Lithuania are as necessary as skis in Africa. 
  Speaking about the problems at the National Defense 
Ministry, 
the chairman of the Seimas National Security Committee noted 
that measures would be applied to prevent the temptation of 
dealing in arms -- a draft law regulating the purchase of arms 
for Lithuanian defense structures is being prepared. The draft 
law does not project that "arms will be bought by the Arms Fund 
alone, and that ministries will be only contractors and experts 
in arms quality." Currently, the Prosecutor General's Office is 
investigating 150 cases concerning disorder at the National 
Defense Ministry.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 04, BNS -- The second reactor of the 
Ignalina nuclear power plant, which was shut down for minor 
repairs Feb. 25, will be turned on Friday night and is expected 
to reach its peak 1,300-megawatt output by Monday [7 March]. 
  The reactor was shut down after detecting radioactive steam 
leaking from an air-tight compartment. 
  Experts established that the steam leaked through some 
worn-out parts of a control valve. 
  Plant officials said the leak was considerably smaller than 
permitted by reactor operation rules. The incident did not 
affect the radiation background inside and outside the plant, 
officials said. 
  Ignalina's leadership said the first reactor will be shut 
down April 4 for maintenance repairs. The reactor might be 
turned off several days earlier or later, depending on the 
situation in the Lithuanian energy system.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 04, BNS -- The normative acts that are 
in force in Lithuania create unequal market conditions for 
private and state-run radio and TV stations, the State Prices 
and Competition Service said Thursday [3 March]. 
  According to the service's preliminary conclusions, 
state-run 
stations are given priority in using transmitters and 
rebroadcasting lines, they are subsidized from the state budget, 
while private stations can rent equipment only by way of contest 
and can earn money only by selling commercial time. 
  Besides, state TV and radio charges considerably less for 
commercial time and thus limits the ability of private stations 
to compete on the market. 
  The competition service intends to submit its final 
conclusions to the parliament and the government when additional 
information about the situation on the TV and radio market is 
obtained. Supposedly, state TV and radio will have to reduce its 
commercial time, while the government will be recommended to 
take into account the income for commercials when allocating 
subsidies to state-run stations.

<F P=106> [Correspondent Cristian Nita report from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] The latest information received from the republican 
commission in charge of preparations for the sociological poll 
"What People Advise" shows that the action is currently 
unfolding normally and the republican commission has not 
received information about any violation of the rules concerning 
the unfolding of the poll. 
  In the eastern rayons of the republic, where citizens had 
the 
opportunity to start voting in the poll a week ago, local 
correspondents report that some of the citizens have the 
possibility to vote on the right side of the [Dniester] river 
and in the Dubossary area, the authorities of the 
self-proclaimed Dniester republic have doubled and even tripled 
the number of border guards. 
  In Chisinau, by 1030 local [0830 GMT] only 10-12 percent of 
citizens that have been registered on lists participated in the 
voting. 
  Mr. Mihail Coscodan, chairman of the commission in charge of 
the organization and unfolding of the poll said this morning on 
the television that the poll has no such legal value as a 
referendum would have had, but its positive results might 
influence the orientation of the future parliament's activity. 
  In turn, President Mircea Snegur, after expressing his 
opinion in the poll, stated this morning to representatives of 
the press that this action lays the foundation for the future 
constitution and the citizens will vote for the existence of a 
democratic state. Today, the fate of our state is being 
decided, said President Snegur. 
  In conclusion, we remind our listeners that the question 
that 
citizens have to answer in a positive or a negative way is the 
following: 
  Are you in favor of the Republic of Moldova's development as 
an independent, unitary, and indivisible state, with borders 
valid since the proclamation of its sovereignty, that is, 23 
June 1990, and in favor of Moldova promoting a policy of 
neutrality that has relations of mutually advantageous 
cooperation with all countries of the world and guaranteeing 
equal rights to all its citizens, in accordance with the norms 
of the international law? 
  In the right hand corner of the voting ticket, two answers, 
namely, "yes" and "no" are marked in capital letters. A ticket 
on which both answers are marked, or on which none of them are 
marked out, is not considered valid.

<F P=106> [Correspondent Septimiu Roman report from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] From the republican commission in charge of 
organizing and unfolding the sociological poll "What People 
Advise" we have learned that so far, two-thirds or approximately 
66 percent of the citizens of Moldova who have been registered 
on lists participated in the voting. 
  In Chisinau the participation in the poll was about 39 
percent, one of the lowest in the republic. We mention that one 
of the reasons for this reduced participation in the poll was -- 
according to the statement by chairmen of several voting 
sections -- the complex nature of the question, which, in fact, 
included five independent questions that citizens had to answer 
with a simple "yes" or "no." It is expected that tomorrow the 
final result will be published. 
  President Mircea Snegur today granted an interview to a 
REUTER reporter. Answering a question that referred to the 
sociological poll "What People Advise," Snegur said that today 
the Moldovan people emphasized their option by affirming their 
legitimate will to live in a state that from a territorial 
viewpoint is independent. The head of state assessed that the 
results of the poll will eliminate the speculations of leaders 
in Tiraspol regarding the intentions of the Republic of Moldova 
to unite with Romania. 
  Regarding the statute of the 14th Russian Army, Mircea 
Snegur 
said that the forecasts and statements of certain people have 
nothing in common with the official negotiations, during which 
the representatives of the Republic of Moldova demanded the 
withdrawal of the Russian military forces. In practical terms, 
the terms of withdrawal are being discussed and a common 
language with the authorities of the Russian Federation will be 
found on these issues, said Snegur. He also expressed the view 
that by joining the Partnership for Peace program, the Republic 
of Moldova will become more secure, because the respective 
initiative proposes to eliminate all possible tensions in Europe.

suppliers not to resort to extreme measures, like cutting off 
gas supplies because of nonpayments, stated Boris Karandyuk, 
director general of Moldova's state department on gas supplies. 
Yesterday he held talks on settling Chisinau's gas debt to 
Russia with Gazprom managers. Chisinau will clear its debt by 
supplying goods, particularly agricultural goods.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] The chief advisor to the Moldovan president, Viorel 
Chubotaru, has tendered his resignation. In an interview with 
INTERFAX, he motivated his decision by saying that as a result 
of the recent parliamentary elections the Social Democratic 
Party, which nominated him for the republican parliament did not 
obtain the right to pursue its policy. 
  "As the head of the executive, the president cannot base his 
moves on a representative of any political course which has 
failed to receive the support of the majority of citizens," 
Chubotaru made clear. 
  Asked whether the parliamentary majority is able to 
stabilize 
the situation in the country, he pointed out that this depended 
on how to understand the stabilization and what methods will be 
used to achieve it. "We believe that the retention of 
sovereignty by the republic's people is the main aspect of 
Moldova's retention of independence as a state. This means 
achieving an economic sovereignty, e.g. a possibility to pursue 
an independent economic policy, free from pressure from 
outside," Chubotaru was quoted as saying. 
  In his opinion, the new government's actions within the next 
six months will not affect Moldova's relations with 
international financial and economic institutions, in 
particular, the implementation of a memorandum signed by the 
Moldovan government, National Bank of Moldova, IMF and World 
Bank for the period until July 1 1994. 
  Chubotaru believes that the state program for privatization 
developed by the Social Democratic Party will not be drastically 
amended within the next six months. At the same time, he did 
not rule out the possibility of other than original 
interpretations of the key provisions of the law and the 
privatization program.

  [Text] The Moldovan Foreign Ministry believes that the 
statements by some Romanian senators are of "insulting nature 
intended to put the results of the parliamentary elections in 
Moldova under the question mark and undermine the authority of 
its leadership," according to its note to the Romanian Foreign 
Ministry. 
  The note followed a session of the Romanian Senate on 
Thursday which focused on the results of the parliamentary 
elections in Moldova and allowed itself a number of tactless 
statements concerning Moldova. 
  The document stipulates that "speaking about romanofobia [as 
received] and anti-Romanian sentiments in Moldova, the Romanian 
Senate actually questions Moldova's statehood and the legality 
of its borders." 
  "We are far from considering the elections to the Moldovan 
parliament as perfect. However, we maintain that the upper 
chamber of Romanian parliament made tendentious and absolutely 
inequitable attacks capable of affecting the good-neighborly 
relations between Romania and Moldova," the note concludes.

  [Text] The Moldovan Defense Ministry refuted allegations of 
postponing the next round of the Moldovan-Russian negotiations 
on the status and the terms for withdrawal of the 14th Russian 
Army. It was alleged that the Russian party had demanded the 
postponement. 
  Head of the Moldovan military experts, Nikolay Turturyanu, 
told INTERFAX that several supplementary provisions to the 
Moldovan-Russian general agreement on the 14th Army had been 
worked out during the consultations of the military experts. 
  "The 8th round of the negotiations is to take place in the 
near future. It will focus on the issue concerning the 14th 
Russian Army," Turturyanu added. 
  He stressed that Russia had, as yet, put forward no more 
demands. He reminded that the negotiations were held at the 
state level and the position of the Moldovan Defense Ministry 
reflected the position of Moldova in general. The position of 
Moldova has remained the same, he said. 
  Head of the Moldovan delegation, Moldovan Ambassador to 
Russia, Anatol Taranu confirmed that Moldova had insisted on 
unconditional withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army before 1 July, 
1994. 
  Turturyanu refuted the allegations that the 14th Army might 
be reorganized into a Russian military base on Moldovan 
territory. 
  "These allegations have no grounds. Those who circulate the 
allegations proceed from the example of when Russia transformed 
its military formations on Georgian territory into military 
bases. However, Russia has not even raised this issue at the 
negotiations with Moldova," he pointed out.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Aleksandr Lebed, </F>
commander of 14th Russian Army, by Sergey Knyazkov under the 
"Conflict Zone" rubric; place and date not given: "To Feel the 
Power Behind You. Ten Questions to the 14th Army Commander"] 
  [Text] The person of Lieutenant General Aleksandr Lebed, 
commander of the 14th Russian Army, has long attracted 
attention. The year before last, largely thanks to his efforts, 
the war between Moldova and the Dniester Region was halted. 
People on the left bank of the Dniester literally idolized 
Lebed. But now Dniester Region newspapers have started to 
become full of materials depicting the former hero almost as the 
main opponent of the unrecognized republic. 
  [Knyazkov] Love is one step away from hatred, is it not, 
Aleksandr Ivanovich? 
  [Lebed] The situation in the Dniester Region is complex. I 
would say it is an impasse situation on many counts. The 
political impasse comes from the participation of 
representatives of the DMR [Dniester Moldovan Republic] in last 
October's events in Moscow and the passing of the death sentence 
on the Ilascu group. It is an open secret that Ilascu is a 
scoundrel. But the death sentence was passed on him against a 
background of protests from the United Nations, the CSCE, 
Amnesty International, Russia, the United States, and Britain. 
Appeals by the Pope and by Aleksiy II were ignored.... Thus, 
the political isolation of the unrecognized republic was 
exacerbated. 
  The economic impasse.... National currencies, at the very 
least, have been introduced everywhere, and here they have 
decided to go "their own" way: Onto old Soviet money they have 
stuck stamps with a picture of Suvorov, and they say that this 
is a local currency with a certain degree of protection. But in 
my view this is not money but trash, and even if your pockets 
are full of it it is not used anywhere but in this region. It 
is, of course, primarily the ordinary people who suffer as a 
result. Pensioners receive 14,000 local rubles a month (1,000 
Russian rubles are equivalent to 4,500-5,000 "Suvorovs"). For 
comparison, 1 kg of beef costs 35,000 "local" rubles in the 
market. In short, the situation in the Republic is serious. 
  [Knyazkov] Why, after all, have your relations with the 
Tiraspol leadership become aggravated? 
  [Lebed] I would not say that our relations are entirely bad, 
although you could not call them good either. How can they not 
be strained if there is one provocation after another in respect 
of the Army and its commander? On 13-14 January, for example, 
leaflets were pasted up in the city of Tiraspol calling Lebed 
"the Judas of the Dniester Region, preparing a military coup." 
Next, incidentally, the newspaper PRAVDA specified the date of 
the military coup -- 15 January -- and published a report 
claiming that leaflets calling for the overthrow of DMR 
President Smirnov had been pasted up all over Tiraspol. On 15 
January I was holding a surgery on personal questions, and I 
received 62 people. No soldier was sitting there in a 
bulletproof vest, and they were all engaged according to the 
combat training plan. I have not contemplated and do not 
contemplate any military coups, if only because of a number of 
very simple considerations. The DMR was created by the will of 
the people who live here on the basis of the decisions of the 
second congress of deputies at all levels. For me, the will of 
the people who live here is the supreme form of legitimacy of 
the adopted decisions. The people have a right to reelect their 
leaders, but I have nothing to do with this. I am the commander 
of the 14th Russian Army, I am a Russian general! 
  [Knyazkov] The impression is gained that it is 
advantageous to someone to remove you from the Dniester Region. 
  [Lebed] You are right. Flexible and soft generals, who are 
inclined to make total compromises, are convenient for appanage 
principalities, which is what the DMR is now. I do not count 
myself as one of these and, naturally, I am unwelcome with some 
people. 
  [Knyazkov] What about the Army Military Council's 8 February 
statement, which says that in the event of a large-scale armed 
provocation in the Dniester Region the Army reserves the right 
to cool hotheads on both banks of the Dniester? The Moldovan 
Foreign Ministry viewed that as gross interference in the 
Republic's internal affairs.... 
  [Lebed] I cannot gainsay Moldova's right to make just such 
an assessment of the statement by the 14th Army's Military 
Council. But account must be taken of the fact that I monitor 
carefully the development of the situation. On the eve of the 
parliamentary elections in Moldova the situation was tense. I 
had been seeking and, it seems to me, I found quite a successful 
way out, if I defused the situation with the help of that 
statement. 
  [Knyazkov] The fact that, according to your words, passions 
subsided somewhat on both banks of the Dniester following the 
statement by the 14th Army's Military Council attests not only 
to the timeliness of that document but also to a real force 
whose opinion Chisinau and Tiraspol politicians are obliged to 
take into account. What kind of a force is this -- your army, 
Aleksandr Ivanovich? 
  [Lebed] The Army's personnel complement stands at 85.4 
percent -- very high for these times. I had been planning over 
the next four-six weeks to attain a level of 94-96 percent, but 
we were obliged to suspend the recruitment of contract 
servicemen owing to a lack of clarity with the military budget. 
But even what we do have is quite sufficient. Visit a training 
ground and see for yourself how the guardsmen drive and fire. 
Last year we took examinations on Russian training grounds, and 
nobody got less than a "good," although they were operating on 
unfamiliar terrain. 
  [Knyazkov] From where do the Army's reinforcements come? 
  [Lebed] I recruit only volunteers. There are volunteers 
from Russia. There are, let us put it this way, local draftees, 
but it is necessary to understand the situation in respect of 
them. Some 80,000 Soviet Army pensioners and approximately 
17,000 national economic specialists, who at various times, 
after graduating from corresponding higher educational 
institutions, were sent here to work and took up permanent 
residence here, live on the territory of Tiraspol alone. They 
have children and grandchildren, and the majority of these 
youths have no wish to go and serve in the Dniester Army, still 
less the Moldovan Army. Where are they to go? They come to me. 
Each of the volunteers signs a corresponding document 
confirming that he considers himself a citizen of Russia and 
pledges to take an oath to the Russian Army and to obey Russian 
laws. This document is inserted in his personal file. But I 
emphasize once again that only volunteers serve in the 14th Army! 
  [Knyazkov] But what idea rallies the Russian servicemen in 
the Dniester Region? 
  [Lebed] A patriotic, power idea! But the power itself must 
also meet its defenders halfway. We do not need a great deal, 
we are undemanding. But a person must serve and feel the power 
behind him even at a "down-to-earth level." An officer must 
have an apartment and pay that which enables him to keep his 
family and not eke out a miserable existence. Then his children 
will not fall ill, and his wife will not "nag" him -- then he 
will devote all his strength to service. 
  [Knyazkov] A question in regards to this: How are the 
social problems of officers discharged to the reserve being 
resolved in the Army? 
  [Lebed] It cannot be said that everything has been done, but 
we are tackling housing construction with the utmost intensity. 
I will not hide the fact that we have scored some successes. 
Precisely 222 apartments have already been constructed in 
Rybinsk, Rostov, Smolensk, Kostroma, Lobnya, Zelenograd, Tula, 
Penza, Voronezh, and Berdsk. Pensioners are actively moving in. 
If there is prompt funding, then in 1994 we will attain the 
target of 904 apartments. These will be in the cities of 
Krasnodar, Novorossiysk, Anapa, Engels, Saratov, Belgorod, and 
Vyatskiye Polyany. I will not hide the fact that the process is 
proceeding as planned, and all the contracts have been 
concluded. They are meeting us halfway, and I am endeavoring 
not to let them down. The supreme principle in the Army is that 
not one officer or ensign will be discharged into the reserve 
until he has received housing. 
  [Knyazkov] How do you see the prospects for the 14th Army 
today? 
  [Lebed] As is known, the leadership of the Republic of 
Moldova unequivocally advocates the Army's withdrawal from its 
territory, but the situation is highly complex. The point is 
that it is now impossible, in my view, to withdraw the Army. 
There are very many reasons, starting with the fact that there 
is still no political solution to the past bloody conflict 
between Moldova and the Dniester Region -- accordingly, there 
are no guarantees of peace and stability in this region. The 
possibility of a relapse into hostilities has not been exhausted 
-- people are simply afraid. They see the 14th Army as the 
guarantor of peace and stability, capable of preventing war or, 
if war is nonetheless unleashed, of halting bloodshed. 
Therefore, the Army's withdrawal must be preceded by a very 
long, delicate, and wise political process, which, 
unfortunately, has not yet begun. But it is possible and 
necessary to speak of reorganizing the Army. Following the 
breakup of the unified Union Army, many units of central and 
district subordination became subordinate to me. Some of them 
are simply not needed. Therefore, great reorganization awaits 
the 14th Army. 
  [Knyazkov] To conclude our conversation: What would you 
like to wish your fellow servicemen and, of course, yourself? 
  [Lebed] There is nothing more terrible than a general who 
has not fought. Generals who have not fought and particularly, 
politicians who have not smelled gunpowder, unleash all kinds of 
conflicts with uncommon ease in the hope of some ephemeral 
victory. There are quite a few such conflicts on the territory 
of the former Soviet Union now, but there will be and there can 
be no victors in them. Armenians have been fighting 
Azerbaijanis for umpteen years and have thereby set back their 
development 30 or even 50 years. The Georgians have not 
defeated and will not defeat the Abkhazians, nor will the 
Abkhazians defeat the Georgians. These civil wars have no 
beginning and no end. So I would wish all who have experienced 
evil in them to be able to restore peace with all their reason 
and, if necessary, by force. All pretensions to a large-scale 
civil war must be stopped in a very tough manner. It seems only 
to the evil and fools that "now we will do a little bit of 
fighting here, and then all will be well"... a dangerous 
delusion that is fatal for society.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Gennadiy Kulagin and </F>
Vladimir Akimov and KAZTAG correspondent Gennadiy Lunev] 
  [Text] Almaty 7 Mar, TASS -- Kazakhstan is choosing a new 
parliament and local councils on Monday in this former Soviet 
Republic's first contested elections. 
  Some 756 registered contenders are vying for seats in the 
parliament, six to a seat. Three hundred and sixty-one of them 
were self-nominated, public associations named 331, and 64 were 
nominated by the president. 
  The most widely represented among the candiates are the 
"Popular Unity of Kazakhstan" coalition, the Socialist and 
Republican Parties, as well as the Trade Union Federation, the 
"Popular Congress of Kazakhstan", and the Peasants Union. 
  Voting is going on in more than 10,000 polling stations, 6.5 
thousand of which are located in rural areas and in shepherds' 
winter camps. 
  According to the public opinion poll conducted by the Giller 
Institute ahead of the elections, 62.9 per cent of the voters 
and 50.3 per cent of candidates said they favoured private 
landownership. 74.8 per cent of the voters and 41.7 per cent of 
the candidates said Russian should be given the state language 
status in the Republic. 
  President Nursultan Nazarbayev said at the polling station, 
to which he came together with Prime Minister Sergey 
Tereshchenko to cast their ballots in the elections, that there 
was nothing more important for the Republic at present than "to 
adopt laws which could help democratise our young sovereign 
state, and encourage economic reforms and the restructuring of 
the legal system". 
  "I hope that the new parliament will be more active than the 
previous," the Kazakh presdient said. 
  There is no uniformity of opinion among the voters. 
According to the Giller poll only 25 per cent of them were 
planning to vote for the candidates who prioritise the 
development of private property and free enterprise, while 66 
per cent favoured a tougher state regulation of the economy.

  [Text] Turkish President Suleyman Demirel received Kazakh 
Ambassador Kanat Saidabayev. He conveyed special greetings from 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev, and informed him of some recent 
aspects of internal and foreign policy of our Republic. The 
head of the Turkish state expressed his gratitude to Nursultan 
Nazarbayev for the detailed and warm letter, which, in his view, 
was another proof of the development of friendship and 
cooperation between Kazakhstan and Turkey, and the close 
personal relations between the two leaders. The Turkish 
president noted that the mutual cooperation on political, 
economic, cultural, and humanitarian spheres are deepening and 
widening. 
  For example, he said that Turkish Government credit is being 
implemented successfully, the International Kazakh-Turkish 
University named after Hoja Ahmed Yasevi is already functioning, 
and more than 1,500 students are studying in Turkey. Suleyman 
Demirel sent his warm and sincere greetings to President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev and all Kazakhstani people.

  [Text] Reports from Tashkent say that the relay of Russian 
Television programs on the territory of the republic will 
officially be stopped as of 7 March. The Russian channel has 
been handed over to the Uzbek Television Third Program. It will 
also partly be devoted to relaying programs from Turkey. 
  This means that the 2-million Russian diaspora in Uzbekistan 
will no longer be able to watch Russian Television.

  [Text] Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov has issued a 
decree under which most of the housing construction in the 
Central Asian republic is to be funded either by enterprises or 
private individuals. 
  The state will finance the building of homes only for poorer 
people, large families, pensioners, and war and labor veterans. 
Under the decree, an individual building a house for himself 
does not have to produce an income declaration, may receive a 
credit from a bank for at least 10 years at 20 percent interest 
and buy building materials at reduced prices.

  [Text] As we have already reported, yesterday at Government 
House, Prime Minister Abbas Dzhumagulov had a meeting with 
representatives of various parties and movements of Kyrgyzstan. 
It dealt with questions of the economy and ways of getting out 
of the current situation -- and the situation is truly 
excessively grave -- especially in industry. All major 
factories are working under capacity, almost standing idle. For 
example, the Lenin machine-tool works, the Frunze machine-tool 
works, EVM [computer company] and others are operating at only 
20-25 percent capacity. People working at these factories are 
being forced to take indefinite leave. Agricultural production 
is also falling in the Republic. Now the main reliance is on 
private farming and joint agricultural enterprises with foreign 
firms. This is already happening in Moskovskiy Rayon. The 
prime minister replied to all the questions of those invited.

  [Text] Ashgabat, 4 Mar -- Priority areas of economic 
cooperation between Turkmenia and Japan -- the construction of 
gas and oil pipelines, modernization of oil refineries and power 
stations, and the establishment of powerful desalination plants 
-- were discussed today at the first session of a joint 
committee formed at the end of last year at the suggestion of 
Japan's Ministry of Trade and Industry. Thirteen of Japan's 
biggest companies -- Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Nichimen, Itohchu 
corporation, and others -- have joined it. The committee is 
headed by the Turkmen Vice Prime Minister Rejep Saparov, and 
president of Itohchu Corporation, Minoru Murofushi. 
  Representatives of this firm who are attending the meeting 
expressed their wish to become members of an international 
consortium building a gas pipeline across Iran to Turkey, and to 
take part in the modernization of a number of petro-chemical 
plants. 
  The efforts of the joint committee have already resulted in 
agreement on the construction of a polyethylene plant in the 
town of Seydi, which will be built by Mitsubishi Corporation. 
The Export-Import Bank of Japan is extending credit of $320 
million for this project. 
  The next session of the Japanese-Turkmen economic committee 
is scheduled for next fall in Tokyo.

  [Text] Riga March 4 TASS -- Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs 
Andrejevs called for flexible tactics in negotiations with 
Russia for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia. "A 
reasonable compromise with Russia not only meets the interests 
of Latvia but is of importance for Europe as well," he said. 
  On Thursday the Sejm members discussed the condition set by 
the Russian side during the discussion on the troop pullout and 
concerning a strategic facility, the radar at Skrunda. 
  Russia agrees to withdraw troops by August 31 if the radar 
remains operational for another five years and two months and if 
social guarantees for the military pensioners and members of 
their families are ensured. Otherwise, troops will be withdrawn 
according to the time-table drawn up by Russia, said Sergey 
Zotov, leader of the Russian delegation at the negotiations. 
  Sejm members' opinions over the issue diverged and they 
decided to examine it once again soon.

  [Text] Latvia President Guntis Ulmanis has passed on, via 
Russian Ambassador to Latvia Aleksandr Rannikh, a letter of 
reply to Russian President Boris Yeltsin noting that the 
preparation of several treaties at the interstate talks between 
Latvia and Russia has entered the final stage: a "Treaty on the 
Withdrawal of the Army," a "Treaty on Social Security for 
Servicemen of the Russian Army, Military Pensioners, and Members 
of Their Families," as well as a "Treaty on the Temporary 
Functioning of the Skrunda Radar" could be ready for signing 
already in the course of the next round of talks scheduled for 
14 March. The treaties could be signed during a possible 
meeting of both presidents in Moscow. Left unresolved are the 
questions pertaining to a draft agreement on social protection 
for military pensioners, and the problem of rent for using the 
radar in Skrunda that Russia is expected to pay.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 05, BNS - Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs 
Andrejevs at a meeting with U.S. Ambassador Ints Silins on 
Friday [4 March] expressed his bewilderment over recent remarks 
by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher about Latvia 
depriving its Russian-speaking residents of the citizenship and 
voting rights. 
  Christopher at a meeting of the U.S. Senate's subcommittee 
on 
March 2 had said that according to the legislation adopted in 
Latvia, Russians cannot become citizens of the country and have 
no right to vote. 
  The U.S. Ambassador in his explanation said that Christopher 
apparently had not been precise enough, as it was clear that 
many ethnic Russians are Latvian citizens and have the right to 
vote in elections. 
  The Latvian foreign minister also expressed worries about 
Christopher's remarks that Russia had the right to stimulate 
Latvians to extend the citizen's status to a wider circle of 
residents and grant the voting right also to the Russians living 
in the country. 
  The ambassador said that it was only the ethnic Russians 
living in Latvia who were referred to in Christopher's 
statement. The remarks also had indicated only legal and 
democratic methods of action by the Russians toward achieving a 
settlement of the citizenship issue, only attempts to convince 
the Latvians that the interests of ethnic Russians should be 
taken into account. 
  Silins in his concluding remarks pointed out that there was 
no change in the United States position in principle toward 
Latvia, and that this was also in evidence during recent visits 
by Latvian delegations to the United States, as well as in 
permanent support to Latvia by U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  The ambassador at the conversation also asked about the 
process of the Latvian-Russian talks. 
  He said the U.S. ambassadors to Central and Eastern Europe 
were scheduled to meet in Warsaw soon.

<F P=106> [Article by Janis Kulmanis: "National Forces Might Call a </F>
Referendum on Skrunda] 
  [Text] Riga, 22 Feb -- Several representatives of the Union 
of National Forces [NSA] stated at a press conference today that 
there is a possibility that a popular referendum on the question 
of the Skrunda radar station may be organized. 
  As DIENA has already reported, the NSA has adopted a 
statement protesting against the Latvian Government's agreement 
with Russia to keep the Skrunda radar station in operation for 
another four years, with an additional 18 months for its 
dismantling. Quite a number of representatives of the 
organizations included in the NSA expressed the view that 
Skrunda is similar to other bases which Russia has promised to 
vacate by 31 August of this year. 
  Baiba Petersone, representative of the Movement for Latvia's 
National Independence [LNNK] said that although Latvia has a 
democratically elected parliament and the national situation is 
more favorable than it was in 1939, the interstate negotiations 
are being carried on in secret, with the people and even the 
Saeima [parliament] not being informed. Petersone said the 
national forces will maintain their rights for means of direct 
democratic action, by initiating the referendum and using other 
means of nonviolent resistance. 
  Aigars Jirgens, a representative of the Fatherland and 
Freedom organization, has criticized the fact that the Cabinet 
of Ministers was not given the right to authorize the delegation 
to talks with Russia and give consent for the continued 
operation of the Skrunda radar station. The Latvian Government 
can not count on support from the people, he said. He said also 
that he has faith in Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis, who has 
promised not to sign an agreement allowing for the continued 
operation of the Skrunda radar station. 
  Uldis Augstkalns, leader of the Latvian People's Front, 
expressed the belief that for Russia, the Skrunda stations is 
not so much a matter of security than of policy, and that by the 
agreement, which is being prepared by the two state delegations, 
the Latvian Government is accepting Russia's strategic interests 
in Latvia. 
  U. Augstkalns stated that to have a bad agreement is better 
than to have none at all. He also spoke in favor of a popular 
referendum on this question, because this is a matter of 
national survival. 
  The representative of the Association of Latvian National 
Soldiers was indignant: We have not learned from the experience 
of our history, and this applies to the current policy of the 
Latvian Government. 
  DIENA has already reported, the Club of Environment 
Protection has printed 10,000 postcards to send to the Saeima 
demanding the immediate dismantlement of the Skrunda station and 
withdrawal of Russian soldiers. All in all, 4,000 cards will be 
disseminated by LNNK. 
  In reply to a question from DIENA if there is a possibility 
to succeed in concluding such an agreement with Russia, Ilgonis 
Klavins, representative of Christian Democrats, expressed a 
skeptical view regarding the very sense of a bilateral 
agreement. In his opinion, it should be signed on the 
international level, with the participation of countries which 
have signed the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam treaties, thus 
creating the present order in the post- war period. 
  DIENA was interested in learning if any of the 
representatives of the national forces have visited the Skrunda 
base, but we received no direct answer to this question. 
  Some time ago, while visiting Ludza, President Guntis 
Ulmanis 
also expressed a view supporting the idea of a referendum on the 
question of the Skrunda radar base. However, Presidential Press 
Assistant Anta Busa could not confirm to DIENA if the president 
is of the same opinion now. 
  In accordance with Article 73 of the Constitution of the 
Latvian Republic, agreements with other states are not to be put 
to a popular vote. Minister of Justice Egils Levits confirmed 
to DIENA that the question of Skrunda cannot be resolved by a 
referendum.
