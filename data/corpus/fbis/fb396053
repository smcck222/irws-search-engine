  [Text] The Government of the Republic of Estonia has issued 
a statement in connection with the Estonian-Russian talks. The 
Government expresses regret over the Estonian-Russian talks 
breaking off due to the Russian side's unconstructive behavior. 
The Russian side's attempt to back down on the agreed deadline 
for the troop withdrawal does not allow for the initialling of 
an already drafted troop withdrawal agreement. Russian 
insistence on additional conditions, including one on the 
Estonian Government having to pay the Russian Government $23 
million, is in conflict with the international obligation which 
Russia has taken upon itself, which is to withdraw the troops 
from Estonia quickly, in an orderly manner, completely and 
unconditionally. 
  The Government statement says that in this situation the 
Government of the Republic of Estonia protests against Russian 
attempts to destabilize the situation in the Baltic Sea region. 
The Government states once again that the Russian troops must 
be completely withdrawn from the territory of the Republic of 
Estonia by 31 August 1994 at the latest. The Government appeals 
to Russia to abandon its unconstructive attitude and continue 
talks; it proposes to Russia to hold consultations at a high 
political level. The Government of the Republic of Estonia 
reaffirms the existence of Estonian goodwill to continue talks 
in this situation.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Dmitriy Chubarov] 
  [Text] Moscow March 4 TASS -- Russia is prepared to 
withdraw its troops based in Estonia before August 31, 1994 but 
only if a treaty on social protection of Russian military 
pensioners is signed, Vasiliy Svirin, head of the state Russian 
delegation to the talks with Estonia, told a news conference 
today in connection with the completion of the 17th round of the 
Russo-Estonian negotiations earlier this week. 
  Estonia, he said, does not implement its statement made at 
the 14th round of the Russo-Estonian talks as regards the draft 
agreement on social protection of military pensioners and 
members of their families. Russia wants all retired ex-Soviet 
servicemen to be granted permanent resident status which is 
rejected by Estonia. Besides, the Russian side has not yet 
received the confirmation that Estonia will allocate financial 
means for building housing in Russia for servicemen of the 
Russian troops to be withdrawn. 
  "Taking into consideration an Estonian side's actual refusal 
to fulfill the promises earlier given by it, which served the 
basis for Russia's proposal about August 31, 1994 as a final 
date of the withdrawal, the Russian side states that its troops 
pullout will be implemented according to the timetable worked 
out by Russia," Vasiliy Svirin stressed. 
  The problem of territorial claims, he noted, is raised 
practically at each round of the Russo-Estonian talks and causes 
certain tension. However, this problem has no direct influence 
on the talks on the troops withdrawal and the condition of 
military pensioners. 
  "We have never linked a troops pullout to any other 
problems, 
but at the 17th round of the talks the Estonian side suddenly 
stated that it invited Russia to The Hague International Court 
to determine the legality of the established borders. Moscow is 
guided in this issue, the Russian side replied, by the United 
Nations Charter which legalized the inviolability of frontiers 
in Europe, as well as by other international and legal documents 
to which Estonia also became a party", the representative of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry emphasized.

  [Text] Moscow, Mar 04, BNS - Artur Laast, 
minister-counsellor at the Estonian Embassy in Moscow, at a 
press conference today said there was strong hope that the talks 
between Estonia and Russia will continue despite recent 
indications of the contrary. 
  Laast told reporters in Moscow he would rather not try 
predicting the decision the government in Tallinn is going to 
make on the issue, but he added there was "a strong feeling that 
the talks will go on." 
  The Estonian diplomat quoted an interview by Alexandr 
Udaltsev, the senior official in charge of relations with the 
Baltics at the Russian Foreign Ministry, in which Udaltsev said 
his country may return to the deadline of Aug. 31 for pulling 
out its troops from Estonia, if Estonia abided by the conditions 
several times repeated by Russia. Laast underlined that Russia 
has not finally given up the deadline, but is just stipulating 
this date as connected with certain conditions. 
  Laast dismissed as ungrounded the accusations by some 
Russian 
diplomats that Estonia had promised to pay 23 million U.S. 
dollars to build houses for the repatriated Russian military. 
He said that this money could have been only provided to 
Estonia by Western countries, which, however, don't want to 
finance the building of houses for officers in active military 
service. 
  The Estonian diplomat further said there had been no backing 
down by his country on the two other issues which Russia says 
had prompted the decision to review the deadline. Laast added 
that the first of these issues -- giving up mutual claims for 
the value of the army property left behind, and for damages 
inflicted by the presence of troops, respectively, had been 
virtually settled and was not even worth to be spoken about any 
longer. 
  Neither have there been any changes in Estonia's position on 
the second issue, that of the presence of retired Russian 
military in the country. The dispute, he said, exists over 
principles that are contradicting Estonia's citizenship law.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 04, BNS -- A number of Western 
countries at a CSCE senior officials meeting in Prague on 
Thursday [3 March] declared their support to Estonia's demand 
that Russia pulled out its troops from Estonia by Aug. 31. 
  Support to the demand was issued in the name of the European 
Union [EU] by Greece, in its capacity as the current presiding 
member of the EU, as well as by Iceland, Canada, Denmark and 
Poland, said Toivo Klaar, head of the political department at 
the Estonian Foreign Ministry. 
  All speakers at the meeting also said the issue of the troop 
withdrawal must not be linked to any other topic. They 
expressed hope that negotiations between Estonia and Russia will 
go on. 
  A representative of Poland in his speech said concentration 
of Russian troops in the Kaliningrad region was causing worries 
and leading to a destabilization of the situation in the region. 
  Russia at the meeting repeated its earlier position, 
speaking 
about the need to resolve the issues "in complex." The Russian 
representative also said 90 percent of the troops his country 
used to have in the Baltics had been pulled out. 
  The Latvian delegation at the meeting was more optimistic, 
saying Russia and Latvia were closer than ever to concluding an 
agreement, a representative at the Estonian Foreign Ministry 
added. 
  The head of the ministry's political department said all 
senior officials at the Prague meeting represented their 
countries' foreign ministers. 
  Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Mari-Ann Rikken also announced 
that the ministry had received a statement by Germany's 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in reaction to the recent statements by 
Russia. Kohl in the message says that the Baltic Sea is no less 
an European sea than the Mediterranean, and, therefore, 
countries situated on the coasts of the Baltic Sea must belong 
to the EU.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 04, BNS -- Denmark insists that Russia 
pulled out its armed force units from Estonia by Aug. 31, Danish 
Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said in a statement on 
Thursday [3 March]. 
  "We cannot allow this kind of violation of the international 
legal norms that is brought about by Russia's backing down on 
its earlier promises," the Danish foreign minister said. 
  The issue of the Estonian-Russian relations was discussed at 
a brief meeting between Petersen and Estonian President Lennart 
Meri in Copenhagen Thursday. Meri made a short stop in the 
Danish capital on his was to an official visit to Switzerland, a 
representative at the Estonian Embassy in Copenhagen said. 
  The Danish foreign minister denounced Russia changing its 
position on the troop withdrawal deadline. He said his country 
will fully support Estonia's rightful claims before 
international organizations on this topic. 
  Support to Estonia's demand that Russian troops be pulled 
out 
from the country by Aug. 31 has been also declared by the 
Swedish prime and foreign ministers, the Lithuanian Government.

<F P=106> [Report by RIA-NOVOSTI correspondent Aleksandr Veretennikov </F>
on interview with Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar conducted 
specially for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI in Tallinn; date not given: 
"`The Russian Question an Amorphous Thing,' Estonian Prime 
Minister Mart Laar Thinks"] 
  [Text] "Unregulated Estonian-Russian relations and the 
political instability in Russia have not yet affected Estonia, 
which will have the highest economic growth in Europe in 1994, 
which, incidentally, is confirmed by representatives of the 
IMF," Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar said during a 
conversation with a RIA-NOVOSTI correspondent. The head of the 
Estonian cabinet of ministers stressed that the fact that there 
is no political disagreement between all political forces in his 
country is a guarantee of his country's economic success. In 
his opinion, there is no agreement even within Russia's 
government. "One part of the government implements reform, 
while the other spends money. The result is utter chaos," Mart 
Laar reckons. He voiced the hope that the "Fedorov-Gaydar" 
reforms will continue in Russia. At the same time he pointed 
out that [former Russian Finance Minister] Boris Fedorov's ideas 
are in many respects similar to his own, and the same Western 
experts advised the group of young reformers in the Russian 
Government as the Estonian Government. 
  The Estonian prime minister also believes that it is quite 
valid to compare Russia with his country as far as economic 
reform is concerned. "Small Estonia has its own advantages when 
carrying out these reforms; however, a large country has greater 
resources and thus greater opportunity for maneuver," Mart Laar 
asserted. 
  "Russia's economic sanctions against Estonia enabled us to 
rapidly orient ourselves to the West, as we had no other 
option," he said. "After all, for two years now Russia has 
refused to sign economic cooperation treaties with the 
republic." In his opinion, all that is reminiscent of Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy's policy, which is nothing new for Estonia. 
  "But surely Estonia benefits more from economic contacts 
than 
Russia?" I asked. 
  "Not at all," the Estonian prime minister said. "Nowadays 
our republic has become totally independent of Russia's economy, 
with which we have a positive balance of trade, while Russia 
only accounts for 12 percent of our imports." He also noted 
that Estonia is gearing its economy to the world market in order 
to be able to sell its industrial output in Paris or London, 
say.... And also in Moscow. 
  "In this respect our aim is integration into Europe's 
political and military as well as economic structures," Mart 
Laar said. According to him, Russia is also willing to join 
these structures, but that will be possible only if it continues 
its economic reforms. Laar voiced misgivings that events in the 
East will take a different course, as shown by its leaders' 
speeches and resolutions and, in particular, their policy toward 
their so-called near neighbors, excessive influence, etc. 
  "Moreover, the matter of the Russians' failure to 
acknowledge 
the former USSR's occupation of Estonia in 1940 -- which the 
rest of the world has already done -- remains unresolved," the 
head of the cabinet of ministers said. "Furthermore, they 
recognize it within the borders of that time." 
  "The borders of our state were changed a a result of its 
occupation in 1945, not even in accordance with the laws of the 
former Union and without the republic itself making that 
decision," he believes. According to the premier, Estonia found 
itself in a situation where its border and its security line 
[kontrolnaya liniya] were in the same place. 
  "We are not linking the resolution of the border issue with 
Russia with other priority problems since we are aware of the 
political situation prevailing there today," Mart Laar stressed. 
"However, we want this question discussed during talks with 
Moscow, but in the presence of the international public and, in 
particular, the CSCE." 
  "Nonetheless, questions of the Russian troop withdrawal from 
the republic are a top priority for Estonia?" 
  "Of course," the prime minister replied. "Estonia is even 
ready to help the Russian military build housing for themselves, 
there is no problem there." In his view, the whole thing is 
only being held up by one signature -- Russia's signature on the 
schedule for its troops' withdrawal from Estonia. 
  The Russians are, regrettably, doing everything they can not 
to provide this schedule, which is naturally restricting the 
flow of money from the West for housing for the military," Laar 
complained. "Those who have housing problems will now have to 
address the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry." 
  "But the ministry already has plenty of problems to solve, 
particularly with regard to the violation of the rights of 
Estonia's Russian-speaking population." 
  "That is evidence once again that Russia very often sees the 
laws of the Baltic countries from a totally different angle," 
the Estonian prime minister explained. "It is not true that our 
laws are not very clear. For instance, only our country's 
citizens will be able to take part in the coming parliamentary 
elections, but I do not know of a single state where people who 
are not citizens can take part in elections of this kind. At 
the same time Estonia is one of the rare countries where all 
Russian-speaking inhabitants were given that right in the 
elections to local self-government bodies. 
  "And here is a positive point: During these elections in 
Narva and Sillamae, which have a largely Russian-speaking 
population, the Russians' chauvinistic forces were defeated, 
which was a kind of protest against the Liberal-Democratic Party 
of Russia and its provocative actions," Mart Laar continued. He 
claimed that of all the Russians in the northeast who took part 
in the elections to the Russian State Duma, only those who 
wanted to become Russian citizens and who had always campaigned 
against the republic's independence voted for Zhirinovskiy. 
  "But what is to be done about the `Russian question' or does 
it really not exist?" 
  "The `Russian question' encompasses people who do not know 
who they really are," the head of the cabinet of ministers said. 
"They have no intention of living either in Estonia or in 
Russia. Of course, most of these people are interested in 
emigrating to the West, but I do not think that Europe is very 
interested in them. 
  "In my view, the main thing for these representatives of 
'homo sovieticus' is to take a psychological step toward 
Estonia, a state whose laws accord with European norms," Mart 
Laar believes. "Especially since it is virtually impossible to 
say that they are being discriminated against, otherwise we 
would not be a member of the Council of Europe. Admittedly, 
every 'homo sovieticus' will have to actively do something to 
survive -- it is after all hard to live by Soviet traditions in 
our country today." 
  "Nonetheless, Mr. Prime Minister, what is to be done about 
the `Russian question'?" 
  "The `Russian question' is an amorphous thing...."

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Vinogradov: "Washington Will Offer </F>
Shevardnadze Its Peace Plan for Abkhazia. Without Russia"] 
  [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze has been faced with the 
temptation to agree to a new option prepared deep inside the 
U.S. Department of State for establishing peace in Abkhazia. In 
Washington it will be suggested to the Georgian president that 
he agree to UN "blue helmets" being sent in without the 
participation of Russian troops. 
  On Monday Bill Clinton is expected to reveal to the guest 
from Tbilisi a U.S.-style plan for settling the Abkhaz conflict. 
The essence of this plan is to restrict Russia's opportunities 
for influencing the situation in the region. Its 2,000-strong 
contingent is to pull back beyond the Psou River, which forms 
the Russian-Georgian border. UN forces will take up positions 
along the Ingury River, forming a security zone between 
Georgians and Abkhazians. The United States is also promising 
to increase financial aid to Tbilisi considerably. 
  If this is so, the situation around Abkhazia is changing 
radically. Until now the sides involved in the conflict have 
relied little on the United Nations and put their trust mainly 
in Russia's good will. With one voice they entreated Boris 
Yeltsin to hurry up and send in troops -- which would have 
created conditions not only for a cease-fire but also for the 
return of 300,000 refugees. 
  Moscow, which recently signed a treaty with Tbilisi, 
proceeded from the premise that it remains the most real force 
capable of instilling order in this part of the Caucasus. 
Yeltsin made military aid for Georgia dependent on progress 
toward a political settlement. 
  At the same time it has become obvious that Russia is biding 
its time, seeking greater tractability from Tbilisi and Sukhumi 
and waiting for the Security Council to invite it to play the 
leading part in the UN orchestra. The United Nations is in no 
hurry either, realizing that Russia itself will not dare to 
assume the role of sole peacemaker. 
  A cooling in Russian-U.S. relations has been sensed in 
recent 
days. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that in 
this situation Washington can be expected to take surprise 
actions aimed at putting Russia in its place.

  [Text] As you know, Jaba Ioseliani [head of Georgian 
delegation at Abkhaz-Georgian negotiations] has been in the 
United States for several days. A few minutes ago, we phoned 
him in Washington. Mr. Ioseliani said that he has had very 
important meetings in the UN Security Council, chiefly 
pertaining to a peaceful settlement of the Abkhazian problem. 
Asked whether the United Nations will be sending peacekeeping 
forces to Abkhazia, Ioseliani said: 
  [Begin Ioseliani recording] I have just been to the Security 
Council. It is not a simple thing for America and neither is it 
for others. It must be clear why and for what reasons. It 
should be decided whether America and other Western countries 
will participate in this action. It costs 100 million [currency 
not specified] to carry out this operation. No one wants to 
spend this amount. Why should I spend this money and send you 
troops if you fail to manage your own business and the United 
Nations does not have that money? Deputies, members of 
parliaments, congressmen are against this. But this time the 
attitude is a little bit different and if Shevardnadze's visit 
influences congressmen and others, especially senators, whose 
concern this allotment of funds is, then everything will be all 
right. [end recording] 
  We regret that the quality was poor due to the telephone 
line. 
  Finally, an official document about the UN peacekeeping 
forces can be received but, according to the United Nations, 
these forces will comprise Russian servicemen only. Today, at 
the Security Council, there will be a discussion pertaining to 
the extension of a peace mandate for the UN observers in 
Abkhazia. Jaba Ioseliani has been planning to make a speech on 
recent developments in Gali rayon. 
  Asked what significance is attached to Eduard Shevardnadze's 
visit to the United States, Jaba Ioseliani said that 
Shevardnadze's authority could have a decisive influence on the 
handling of the issue of sending UN peacekeeping forces to 
Abkhazia. During these very days, it will possibly be decided 
whether the United States and the European countries will take 
an active part in the handling of current processes in the 
Caucasian region.

  [Text] Prague, 6 Mar -- Peace in the Transcaucasus cannot 
be attained without Russia's decisive participation, Eduard 
Shevardnadze, chairman of Georgia's State Council, stressed here 
today at a meeting with journalists. En route to the United 
States, he made a brief stopover in Prague, where he had a 
meeting with Vaclav Havel, president of the Czech Republic. The 
Georgian leader pointed at "mutual understanding" in his 
relations with Russia and with Russian Federation President 
Boris Yeltsin. 
  A Georgian embassy is expected to be opened in Prague in the 
near future to represent the republic's interests in the Czech 
Republic and in other Central European countries.

from Moscow yesterday. On his return to Tbilisi, the prime 
minister said the following. 
  [Begin Patsatsia recording] This was a working visit. Almost 
all the issues I discussed with Oleg Soskovets [Russian deputy 
prime minister] were resolved positively. Thus, a credit of 4.5 
billion rubles, previously planned for 1993, has now been 
officially registered. Another credit of 20 billion rubles will 
be registered in the near future before the end of March. Boris 
Yeltsin has issued an instruction that this credit of 20 billion 
rubles should be registered. 
  I would like to say a few words about the gas issue. We 
raised a the question of gas supplies from Russia. This issue 
is under consideration at present and I believe it will be 
resolved positively. We will find it more profitable because it 
will cost us less than that from Turkmenistan. However, it does 
not mean that we are going to stop receiving gas from there.

  [Text] Moscow, 4 Mar -- Colonel-General Viktor Samsonov, 
chief of general staff to coordinate military cooperation among 
CIS states, said at a meeting today [4 March] with Georgian 
Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia, that the collective security of 
Commonwealth states is being strengthened, taking into account 
the specific features of the organizational development of the 
national army of the Republic of Georgia and the solution of 
other problems of multilateral military cooperation, the staff 
press center told ITAR-TASS correspondents. 
  The staff considers the Russian-Georgian treaty on 
friendship, neighborliness, and cooperation signed in February 
in Tbilisi to be an example of Georgia's practical cooperation 
within the framework of the Commonwealth. This document, in 
particular, reflects the intentions of the sides to adopt 
measures to implement effectively agreements on the temporary 
stay of Russian military formations on the territory of Georgia, 
and also to conclude agreements on lending assistance in setting 
up Georgian Armed Forces, in fitting them out, and in their 
acquisition of armaments, military weapons, and technological 
equipment without the right to hand them over to third countries.

  [Text] Tbilisi, March 4. (SNARK) -- The highest danger 
faced by Georgia today is radicalization of political forces in 
the republic, declared at a press-conference today Zurab 
Zhvania, the general secretary of the most influential party 
Georgian Civil Union. He spoke against all kinds of "street 
actions" as forms of political struggle. 
  Representative of the party, founded by Eduard 
Shevardnadze's initiative, stated that demonstrations and 
meetings may ultimately result in creation of absolutely 
different forces which may attempt to revive old communist 
principles in the country. Therefore the oppositional parties 
and the Civil Union have to join their efforts in construction 
of a free and powerful Georgia, emphasized Zurab Zhvania.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Chernykh: "They Say That...Georgia Is </F>
Preparing for a Coup"] 
  [Text] For the first time in the post-Soviet period there 
has been a unification of the whole opposition -- from the 
left-wing liberals to the right-wing radicals -- in Georgia. 
The bloc is headed by Georgiy Chanturiya, leader of the 
National Democratic Party. The opposition is campaigning 
against head of state Eduard Shevardnadze, the Civic Union 
organization headed by him, and the parliamentary majority. 
  The reason for this unification is the ratification by 
parliament of the decision to join the CIS. Chanturiya and Co. 
believe that the speaker grossly violated the standing orders 
and flouted all the laws. A law suit has already been filed 
with the republic's Supreme Court. 
  It is worth recalling here that the ratification took place 
to the accompaniment of whistling, cat calls, choice swearwords, 
and fisticuffs. The hall of sessions was like the central 
market when a thief has been caught and above all this uproar 
was heard the shrill voice of one of the deputies signing the 
anthem of the Soviet Union. If all these scenes are repeated 
out on the streets, and the leaders of the opposition movement 
are perfectly capable of doing that, the situation will get out 
of control. And the new alliance is in a very determined state 
of mind. 
  The situation is being complicated by the fact that on 7 
March Shevardnadze is flying to the United States at the 
invitation of President Clinton. It would be a good idea if he 
took David Zeikidze, Tbilisi's police chief, along with him. A 
year ago this conscientious state servant declared: "I get spat 
on whether I authorize a rally or not. So I shall disperse it!" 
In most cases he has kept his promise since then. In this 
connection one is bound to recall that the previous Georgian 
coup began precisely with the dispersal of a National Democratic 
Party rally. 
  The leaders of the opposition parties have held a 
confidential meeting in Tbilisi. The audience adopted an appeal 
to the United Nations, the peoples of the world, and the 
governments of all countries. The appeal notes that the 
decision on affiliation to the CIS is illegitimate and the vote 
was held in conditions of terror. The ratification is called a 
"coup from above." The opposition leaders believe that such an 
important decision must be adopted only by a nationwide 
referendum.

  [Text] The 16 opposition parties protesting Georgia's 
joining to the CIS had a meeting in the headquarters of the 
People's Front in Tbilisi. 
  "The main purpose which unites us is the struggle against 
Georgia's joining to the CIS. We must avoid arguing on 
second-rate issues," Leader of the National Democratic Party, 
Georgi Chanturiya stressed. 
  The opposition parties refused to establish a single 
organization. They decided to carry out their political 
cooperation through regular consultations which will take place 
in different parties' headquarters. 
  The opposition has initiated collection of signatures for 
the 
country's independence and against Georgia's joining to the CIS. 
The opposition parties adopted an appeal to the UN, the world 
community and the heads of state which says that the Georgian 
leadership had tried to legalize the loss of independence and 
the republic's joining to the modernized Russian empire.

  [Text] An edict on temporary measures to improve the 
situation in petroleum product supply in Georgia has been signed 
by Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the Georgian parliament and 
head of state. The edict says: 
  In order to improve a grave situation in the supply of 
petroleum products to Georgia, to ensure fuel supplies to areas 
of strategic importance, and to ease budget payments, a tax on 
petroleum products imported to the Republic of Georgia by legal 
and physical persons--except the state company 
Saknavtobprodukti--will be paid temporarily in 1994 in kind and 
will be fixed at 10 percent of the total amount of the imported 
products, replacing a customs duty, an excise, a value-added 
tax, an environmental tax, and a profit tax. 
  The products will be sold by the state company 
Saknavtobprodukti, taking into consideration branch and regional 
priorities determined by the Cabinet of Ministers of the 
Republic of Georgia. 
  Railway, maritime transport, and customs departments of the 
Republic of Georgia will ensure the delivery of the imported 
petroleum products to their destination only in accordance with 
papers issued by the aforementioned company. 
  The republic's Ministry of the Internal Affairs will render 
assistance to the concern in receiving, moving, and guarding the 
petroleum products. 
  The edict will take effect on 15 March of the current year. 
The complete text of the edict will be published in the press.

  [Text] Yerevan, March 5. (SNARK) -- The striving of the 
peace making forces to achieve the coordinated solution to the 
Karabakh conflict settlement was highly appreciated by Vahan 
Papazyan, the Foreign Minister of Armenia. In Papazyan's 
opinion despite the independent attempts of Russia and CSCE to 
stop bloodshed in the region, up-to-date reality dictates the 
necessity of convergency of both parties' positions, and it will 
lead to the more noticeable results in the conflict settlement. 
"The Armenian diplomacy makes all efforts in this direction, and 
today's visit of Jan Eliasson, the chairman of the CSCE's Minsk 
Group to Armenia mainly will be connected with the question of 
convergency the Russia's and CSCE's positions in Karabakh 
problem'' Papazyan said.

  [Text] Yerevan March 6 TASS -- A delegation of the Minsk 
group on Nagorno-Karabakh of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe headed by its chairman Jan Eliasson 
arrived in the Armenian capital Yerevan on Sunday. During a 
meeting with Armenian Foreign Minister Vagan Papzyan, Jan 
Eliasson shared his impressions about his visit to Baku and 
Stepanakert. 
  According to Eliasson, both Baku and Stepanakert had come to 
the conclusion that it was impossible to settle the Karabakh 
conflict by means of force. He said the Minsk group maintained 
contacts with Russian president's envoy Vladimir Kazimirov. The 
CSCE Minsk group leadership hopes to find a key to the peaceful 
settlement of the conflict in close cooperation with all the 
parties concerned including Russia, he said. 
  The Armenian foreign minister expressed hope the Minsk 
group's activities would help determine all the initial 
positions to get the process of preparation to the Minsk 
conference on Karabakh moving. The only possible way to settle 
the Karabakh conflict is to coordinate the CSCE mediatory 
efforts with Russia's peace-making initiative, Papazyan said. 
In this connection he expressed hope the Minsk group leadership 
and the staff of the CSCE chair would work in close cooperation 
with the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  Later in the day the CSCE delegation held working 
consultations with the Armenian Foreign Ministry's expert group 
headed by First Deputy Foreign Minister Zhirair Liparityan. 
  Jan Eliasson also met Armenian Defence Minister Serzh 
Sargsyan. 
  The CSCE Minsk group delegation arrived in Yereven after 
meetings with the Azeri leadership during which Eliasson called 
for stage-by- stage settlement of the conflict on the basis of 
international principles and stressed that the cease-fire 
agreement was the first step towards restoring peace in the 
region. He said CSCE is ready to send observers to the region.

  [Text] Yerevan March 7 TASS -- The Karabakh conflict can be 
settled only by joint efforts of the international community 
which combine the peace initiative of the Conference for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe and Russia's mediatory 
initiatives, according to the concerted view expressed by 
Armenian officials and chairman of the CSCE's Minsk Group Jan 
Eliasson on the second, closing day of the visit by the Swedish 
diplomat and his colleagues to Armenia. 
  The visiting group members are scheduled to meet Armenian 
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and parliament members, as well as 
to visit Catholicos Vazgen II, the head of the Armenian 
Apostolic Church. 
  Before leaving Yerevan for Vienna, CSCE delegation members 
are due to meet reporter at a press conference devoted to the 
results of their visit. 
  On the first day of the visit, the CSCE group met Armenia's 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Vahan Papazyan. During the meeting 
Jan Eliasson told the Armenian minister about his impressions 
from a trip to Baku and Stepanakert and talks with the leaders 
of the warring sides -- Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  According to the Swedish diplomat, people in the region are 
firmly convinced that the Karabakh conflict can not be settled 
by forcible methods. This view is shared by Baku and 
Stepanakert, the CSCE official said. 
  Eliasson said the Minsk Group maintains contacts with the 
Russian president's personal envoy Vladimir Kazimirov. "The 
leaders of the CSCE's Minsk Group hope to find the key to the 
peaceful settlement of the conflict in close interaction with 
all parties concerned, including Russia," the diplomat said. 
  For his part, the Armenian minister expressed the hope that 
the new leadership of the Minsk Group would work more 
effectively to identify the starting positions for setting in 
motion the process of preparations for the Minsk conference on 
Karabakh. 
  Jan Eliasson also met Armenia's Defence Minister Serzhik 
Sarkisyan.

  [Text] Yerevan, March 5. (SNARK) -- The official visit of 
the Foreign Minister of Armenia to Israel, that was postponed 
according to a mutual agreement, will take place in several 
months. Vahan Papazyan, the Foreign Minister, told SNARK about 
it. 
  According to him the beginning of the dialog with Israel has 
a great importance for Armenia, "which is not only the member of 
the SIC [expansion unknown] but also the Near-Eastern country." 
In his opinion existence of the numerous Armenian community in 
Israel should be taken into account, and it is useful to 
establish close relations with the community.

  [Text] After two days of fierce fighting, Armenian forces 
in Nagorno-Karabakh have beaten off the Azeri advance on Fizuli 
dealing tangible losses on the adversary, a military spokesman 
for Karabakh defence forces told Interfax. The situation has 
somewhat evened on Sunday morning. 
  There were positional battles there throughout Saturday with 
no substantial gains made by either side. 
  At the same time, the spokesman denied the Azeri defence 
ministry's report saying that up to 100 Armenian soldiers were 
killed following an abortive Armenian advance. Three Armenian 
tanks were also destroyed. 
  Reports from Stepanakert say that 120 Azeri soldiers have 
been killed in two days of fighting. Two Azeri tanks and one 
APC were hit. Nine Armenian soldiers were also killed and 35 
others injured.

Karabakh Defense Army (KDA), in the developed combats Karabakh 
forces were able to reject all attacks of Azeri troops in

violations by Azerbaijani side, since the truce agreement was 
reached in mediation of Russian military establishment. Mamunts

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] The president's aide Levon Zurabyan has said that 
the Armenian-Azeri conflict has reached the stage when it is 
impossible to speak about a stable and guaranteed truce without 
the use of disengagement force. The aide welcomed Russia's 
preparedness to send such force to Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Addressing a briefing in Yerevan, Zurabyan said that today 
Russia is the only state which is prepared to take such a step 
and "it is obvious that Russia shows resoluteness". He also did 
not rule out the possibility of the arrival to the region 
shortly of Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev to continue 
the talks and achieve a truce. 
  The aide believes the by the moment Azerbaijan exhausted all 
its reserves during the recent large-scale offensive at the 
Karabakh front which the country launched December 18 [sentence 
as received]. Baku, he said, only seized the settlement of 
Goradiz at the expense of many casualties. 
  At the present stage Azerbaijan has sustained another 
defeat, 
said the aide. He believes this could also be described as a 
defeat of the policy to settle the Karabakh conflict by the use 
of force. 
  Zurabyan believes that now there are all prospects for a 
peaceful settlement of the conflict. He stressed the importance 
of the meeting in Moscow February 18 of the defence ministers of 
Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and representatives of 
Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  The protocol signed during the meeting, he said, provides 
for 
the establishment of truce in Karabakh and the discussion of 
further political steps. The concept has always served as a 
basis for the Armenia leadership stance, said Zurabyan. 
  He said the frontline is to be fixed, after which the 
conflicting sides are to disengage the troops to 10-15 
kilometers of the contact line. Next it is planned to create 
joint monitoring groups which will be deployed along the front 
perimeter and will act under the control of the joint chiefs of 
staff. The agreement does not provide the site for the 
withdrawn troops from the occupied territories. 
  If the mechanism works, said Zurabyan, we shall have a 
guaranteed and lasting truce. And then the question could be 
raised about a four-partite summit meeting which will discuss 
political aspects of the Karabakh problem. 
  Speaking about the relations between Armenia and Georgia, 
Zurabyan said that no matter what, they are normal and both 
sides believe that only joint efforts can help them overcome the 
crisis. The problem is related to the political situation in 
Georgia, he said, which is on the brink of chaos now. The 
explosions at the railway on March 2 indicates that the Georgian 
leadership does keep the situation under full control. 
  The plenipotentiary envoy of the Russian president, the head 
of the peace mission for settlement in Karabakh Vladimir 
Kazimirov who has recently visited Yerevan and Baku, told 
Interfax that until the warring sides in Karabakh are not 
separated, any agreement on ceasefire "risks to remain just a 
paper". 
  In his opinion, the withdrawal of armed units for distance 
inaccessible for artillery fire can be the only guarantee of 
ceasefire in the region. He noted that so far this condition 
had not yet been met, and "sporadic violations of truce continue 
to take place". 
  The Russian envoy also informed that after the withdrawal 30 
flexible groups of the Russian Army observers will be deployed 
in the "separation strip". These groups will also include 
representatives of the warring sides. "Only in that case it 
would be possible to objectively judge which of the sides 
committed this or that violation", Kazimirov emphasized. 
  The Russian Deputy Defense Minister, Colonel-General Georgiy 
Kondratyev [name as received] who was also in Yerevan and Baku 
told Interfax that on Thursday he had received from the military 
command of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh a response 
to proposals of the Russian side on the settlement of the 
conflict. (The warring sides were offered to proceed with the 
ceasefire process, to withdraw to agreed regions heavy weapons 
within March 2- 5 and to mutually separate troops in the 
Mardakert and Fizuli directions - IF). According to the 
general, Armenia and Nagorno- Karabakh agreed to accept these 
proposals on the condition that Azerbaijan does the same. 
However Azerbaijan, he said, agreed to just continue the 
process of ceasefire and considered it unacceptable to withdraw 
arms and troops to regions determined beforehand, because 
Armenian units are located on the occupied territories of the 
republic. 
  Kondratyev stated that if the warring sides are not 
separated, Russian officers will not be sent "under fire". "If 
the sides do not fulfil the conditions of the protocol, then let 
them fight until the victorious end", he said.

  [Text] Yerevan, March 4. (SNARK) -- Levon Zurabyan, the 
acting press-secretary of the Armenia's president, refuted today 
information of some mass media that Armenia "is going to use the 
Azerbaijani territory occupied by Karabakh for burning 
radioactive waste of the Armenian nuclear power station". He 
called these rumors a propaganda trick. 
  In the interview to the SNARK reporter, Mr.Zurabyan 
expressed an opinion that such rumors are spread out in order to 
prevent renewing of the Armenian nuclear power station's work 
and thereby not to allow Armenia to have an independent energy 
source. 
  Meanwhile, as he pointed out, by spreading out, Azerbaijan 
makes a vain attempt to prove that Armenia infringes on the 
Azerbaijan's territory and even is going to use it for own 
purposes. 
  Mr. Zurabyan said that absurdity of these statements is 
obvious.

that following the bombing of the railway bridge over the River 
Khram in Georgia, a group of bandits set up a roadblock on the 
Sadakhlo highway and thus cut off the shortest motor road from 
Georgia to Armenia. 
  As part of urgent measures adopted by the Armenian 
Government, the Transportation Minister Henrik Kochinyan left 
for Tbilisi today to ensure the use of detours for the 
transportation of vital goods.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Russian Vice President Aleksandr </F>
Rutskoy by Vladimir Ivanidze; place and date not given: 
"Aleksandr Rutskoy Has Taken One Month To Reflect"] 
  [Text] He lifted the telephone handset on the 11th ring. 
The voice sounded calm and seemed not to have changed at all. 
Vice President [as published] Aleksandr Rutskoy said that he 
would not grant an interview to journalists for a month, but he 
did not refuse to speak to IZVESTIYA's correspondent. 
  [Ivanidze] What do you intend to do? 
  [Rutskoy] I want to see how the land lies. I want to 
understand what is happening around me now. In my view, the 
picture is rather dismal. They have been quite unable to 
abandon police methods. Everything remains as in former times. 
My telephone is tapped, believe me. External observation is 
hardly concealed. Not that all this is so terrible.... But 
what happened last October.... I believe that time will judge 
us. [Rutskoy ends] 
  When he started speaking of the October events, I admit I 
was 
prepared to hear the usual accusatory words in such situations. 
We are the good guys, and they are the bad guys. The vice 
president must be given his due. This did not happen. At a 
certain moment it even seemed to me that Rutskoy was tormented 
not so much by the bitterness of political defeat as by the 
deaths of the people who took his side. "The most terrible 
thing is that people died. They were not a rabble, as is being 
written. They were normal young people of very diverse 
professions.... It could all have been different," Aleksandr 
Vladimirovich said. 
  It is interesting that throughout the conversation he did 
not 
once mention his court actions against IZVESTIYA. Even when I 
asked him about the court and the millions of rubles in 
compensation, he did not at once understand what I was talking 
about. "ARGUMENTY I FAKTY telephoned me and asked me to drop 
the case. But I cannot do that. I could not reply to anyone 
when I was held in Lefortovo, when all these `documents' were 
published.... I don't want money. I want apologies." 
  Does the vice president understand that after the elections 
to the State Duma he has become the most dangerous person for 
everyone? That the "spiritual" opposition, having secured seats 
in the Duma, now sees him as a serious rival to its leaders in 
the next presidential election? The amnesty puts Rutskoy in the 
position of someone on a gallows who could have the stool kicked 
from under his feet at any moment. When I told Rutskoy that 
even the communist PRAVDA speaks of him as a general sent by 
Yeltsin into the opposition in order to split it, Rutskoy took a 
deep breath and said with irritation: 
  "You know, I lost faith in all sorts of `-isms' even before 
people started handing in their party cards."

<F P=106> [Mikhail Sharov report under the "Pertinent Remarks" rubric: </F>
"Will Justice Remain on Rutskoy's Side?"] 
  [Text] The Lefortovo prisoners are free. But people in 
the president's entourage are today making desperate attempts to 
rewrite the State Duma's decree on political amnesty -- which, 
incidentally, was adopted by an absolute majority. Some call 
this decision "political madness," others try to frighten us by 
talking about "the beginning of civil war," while still others, 
taking advantage of the opportunity, seek to heap all the blame 
for the events of last October exclusively on the defenders of 
the House of Soviets. 
  But what do the people, the selfsame people in whose name 
statements are often made, the people whose voice they do not 
want to hear, think about this? 
  For more than a month now my heart has been wracked by these 
two huge files of readers' letters. They convey the 
penetratingly clear voice of hundreds of people. And not to 
heed this voice, to "file it away" in the archives, would mean 
to forego conscience and honor, cowardly to evade direct 
questions which require equally direct answers: These letters 
are in defense of the prisoners held in Lefortovo, and the 
overwhelming majority are about Rutskoy. These hundreds of 
messages include 23 collective letters, and very many family 
letters; there are also some which are signed by all (all!) the 
inhabitants of a village or members of a labor collective. 
There are only two letters which condemn the vice president's 
actions. There was nothing even close to such a phenomenon in 
the times of the hounding of B.N. Yeltsin. 
  "Dear Editors! This letters comes from the inhabitants of 
the village of Zhdanovka and the village of Maresovo in 
Krasnooktyabrskiy Rayon, Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast. We often read 
reactions to the events of 3-4 October on the pages of your 
newspaper. We support the actions of A.V. Rutskoy and 
parliament. We believe that the actions of the president and the 
government were provocative. The shelling of the `White House' 
by heavy artillery was really quite inhuman. Thus we are on the 
side of those who are calling for the liberation of A.V. Rutskoy 
and all the prisoners of Lefortovo. Let the real culprits 
suffer punishment...." 
  It is signed by: 
  Yu.N. Dydykin, teacher; L.V. Dydykina, teacher; N.A. 
Fomichev, welder.... Fifty-five signatures in all. 
  Another letter is from the village of Dubrovka in 
Maslyaninskiy Rayon, Novosibirsk Oblast. The letter, which 
carries the message "We are with you!" is signed by as many as 
73 people. A third letter, which carries 52 signatures, sent by 
workers and technical and engineering personnel of the 
"Armizonagropromsnab" AOOT [expansion unknown], Tyumen Oblast, 
reads: "We demand the release from custody of A.V. Rutskoy, 
R.I. Khasbulatov, and the other deputies held in jail. Every 
self-respecting person would have acted in the same way in their 
position." 
  Geographically, the writers of collective letters come from 
all over Russia: Bryansk, Rostov, Smolensk, Volgograd, Ryazan, 
Belgorod, Kaliningrad, Chelyabinsk, Tambov, Leningrad, and Kursk 
Oblasts; Altay and Kuban; the Republics of Komi and Chuvashia. 
Participants in the Great Patriotic War and veterans of 
agricultural production V.S. Belashov, N.T. Zasoba, and M.A. 
Mironenko from Rostov-na-Donu write: "We are with you, 
Aleksandr Vladimirovich [Rutskoy]. Don't lose courage and 
steadfastness. All honorable people are on your side. Demand 
that you be given the opportunity to appeal to the people and 
tell them the truth about the October events. Sooner or later 
retribution will befall those who ordered the tanks to open 
against unarmed people. Despite everything, the people will 
recognize those `heroes' who sold themselves for dollars, who 
opened fire on their own parliament, and beat up deputies. 
Whatever happens, history will tell the truth and put everyone 
in their proper place." 
  Yes, history will undoubtedly tell the truth and give 
everyone their just deserts, when the many hidden springs which 
prompted the bloodshed in the center of Moscow are declassified 
and made public. This will not be tomorrow, or even the day 
after tomorrow. But there is no doubt that this will happen -- 
our readers are absolutely right on this account. 
  I think that the nearer the presidential elections draw, the 
more pressingly and vociferously the problem, which I would 
conditionally call "the Rutskoy question," will arise. The 
ruling team will do their utmost to limit the former vice 
president's activity as much as possible and to prevent him from 
running for president. The opposition will feverishly seek a 
national leader on whom to place its major stake. 
  On whom will this choice fall? On Baburin? An extraordinary 
and attractive figure without a doubt. But I think that, in 
view of his youth, his moment of glory still lies ahead. On 
Svetlana Petrovna Goryachevaya? But she, I think, will not want 
to soil her shining conscience and clean hands in politics any 
further. There is Gennadiy Zyuganov, the pragmatic and powerful 
leader of the Communist Party of Russia, who has grown before 
our very eyes into a major political figure, with whose opinion 
even the "hawks" on the democratic wing have to reckon. But 
Communists have been so tarnished and discredited in the eyes of 
the public, that years will be required to melt the ice of 
distrust and wariness. On Zhirinovskiy? But no self-respecting 
left or center party will want to have dealings with the 
impulsive and unpredictable leader of the Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia (we have already tried "unpredictables"). 
  I venture to suggest that the stake will be placed on 
Rutskoy. He will "satisfy" the patriots and statists -- the vice 
president's recent statements give them no reason to doubt his 
"reliability." The Agrarians and Travkin's party undoubtedly 
find him attractive. The depoliticized Army will probably vote 
for him so as to rehabilitate themselves, so to speak, for 
participating in the shelling of the House of Soviets. I think 
that even the Communist Party has already forgotten Rutskoy's 
schismatic stance in the early days of the Russian Federation 
Supreme Soviet, and will back him for the sake of achieving 
their strategic goals. Women, and also veterans, will 
undoubtedly vote for the young and likable Hero of the Soviet 
Union and general. 
  But Rutskoy's biggest support could be the people, 
who did not attach themselves to any of the dwarfish or more 
massive parties, but kept their sense of compassion for a man 
who had been mistreated -- there is always a peculiar sympathy 
for the persecuted in Rus (does not the coming to power of the 
current president also illustrate this?). I think that voters 
will forget Rutskoy's excessive hotheadedness and emotionalism 
-- he had plenty of time in Lefortovo to cool his ardor, to 
soberly reflect on his views and actions, to "settle down" once 
and for all and mature into a major political figure. 
  Especially today Rutskoy must be viewed in two dimensions. 
The 1991 model of Rutskoy the wounded hero, and the Rutskoy of 
today. The past three years have been for him not simply a time 
of getting to know the corridors of power, not simply a 
political academy -- the three past years, for him as perhaps 
for no other, have contained enough events and trials to last 
others a lifetime. 
  Let us recall that it was not without the aid of Rutskoy, 
who 
split the communist faction in the Congress of People's 
Deputies, that B.N. Yeltsin became chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet. Having become vice president, Rutskoy zealously served 
his boss, but then made a sharp retreat. Let me remark that 
this retreat came at the time of the beginning of drastic 
reforms which cast Russia into the abyss of the severest crisis. 
The evolution of Rutskoy's views and actions took place in 
parallel with the evolution of the majority of the people, who 
have entirely lost faith that the reforms promise them work, 
peace, and sufficiency. In other words, in these troubled times 
Rutskoy, in his world outlook and actions, as it were reflected, 
upheld, and defended not so much his own position, as the 
position of the majority of the people, and not the so-called 
capital electorate. That is to say, he showed himself to be 
not above the voters, but with the 
majority of his voters. And it is probably this which 
explains the fact that it is above all the ordinary people that 
have come to his defense. 
  Now that Rutskoy is free, people -- but this time people in 
the investigative and judicial organs -- will probably begin to 
speak again about his imaginary millions in a Swiss bank 
account, and the initiative in completing the investigations 
will belong, not to the masters of fabricating falsehoods this 
time, but to Rutskoy himself. The exposure of the authors of 
falsifications, the furor which will be raised in the mass 
media, will undoubtedly help to foster his image. 
  Let us not forget either another major trump card which he 
will undoubtedly use, and which no other aspirant could possibly 
hold. After all, it was he, Rutskoy, who was the first of the 
president's entourage to affirm the perniciousness of the chosen 
course; it was he who warned that the "Chicago kids" would bring 
Russia to ruin, it was he who lifted the curtain on the 
corruption that has embraced the upper echelons of power -- it 
was for this, in point of fact, that he was initially slandered 
and ridiculed, and then removed from the political stage as an 
actor displeasing to the ruling regime, one who knew too much. 
  In focusing attention on Rutskoy as the potential leader of 
the organized opposition, I by no means rule out other 
candidates. These could even include the current State Duma 
Speaker I.P. Rybkin, or someone else, perhaps as yet unknown to 
the broad mass of political commentators. For the time being I 
am reflecting only on possible candidates. 
  It is entirely possible that the opposition will fix its 
choice on V.D. Zorkin, whose civic and political standpoint in 
many ways absorbs the views and aims of those who are 
simply dissatisfied with the progress of reforms, and 
those who decisively disagree with their content. 
  In view of the Russian mentality, Zorkin, like Rutskoy, has 
many chances of victory, if, of course, he agrees to take part 
in the presidential elections. He is a faithful servant of the 
law and a tireless defender of the Constitution who is "sick of 
cringing" to the present authorities. He in no way compromised 
himself or blackened his reputation in the events of October; by 
nature and by upbringing he is a peacemaker, inclined to speak 
and find compromises in crisis situations. Moreover, he was 
humiliated and persecuted. But, in comparison with Rutskoy, 
Zorkin is a great diplomat, a more sensible and balanced 
politician, and, let us not forget, a highly experienced lawyer. 
  It seems to me that the ideal scenario would be for them to 
enter the elections in harness. This is not a case of the 
"fiery steed" and the "timid doe" hitched to the same wagon, but 
rather, two horses who wish to haul the heavy burden of Russia's 
difficult problems from the abyss. 
  Undoubtedly, this does not exhaust the list of potential 
presidential candidates. There is no doubt that Vladimir 
Volfovich [Zhirinovskiy] will put forward his candidacy, though 
his daily plunging popularity hardly leaves him any hope of 
victory, especially since a major split will probably occur in 
the liberal democrats' camp. 
  The current prime minister will most likely stand. But his 
chances will, in my view, also be slim, since hitherto unknown 
facts about the October events, which will by no means be to his 
advantage, will emerge during the preelection wrangles. Nor 
will the ever-deteriorating economic background, the growth of 
prices, and the mass impoverishment of the people, work in his 
favor. 
  We could see other well-known names also on the list of 
aspirants to the post of president. Shakhray's move away from 
democrats like Gaydar, Chubays, Ponomarev, and Yakunin, who have 
failed and compromised themselves, his attempt to glide along 
the "center," and his statement on the need to free the 
Lefortovo prisoners, are nothing less than the start of his bid 
for the presidency, an effort to stake out for himself political 
territory for the future. Experienced in palace intrigues, a 
man who knows how to look ahead, and who is flirting with the 
regions, Sergey Mikhaylovich is clearly seeking to undermine the 
vigilance of the Russian people. 
  Without a doubt, the economist Grigoriy Yavlinskiy -- author 
of the once-sensational "500 days" program -- will also make a 
bid for power. The democrats are already today trying to 
convince us all that there is no more popular man in Russia than 
Yavlinskiy, and thereby an attempt is already at this early 
stage being made to pave his way to the coveted office. Oh, 
this made-to-order sociology! I would like to believe that 
Yavlinksiy's name is well known to the inhabitants of a small 
town or rayon center, let alone a village. Alas, the name of 
this undoubtedly clever person, who, however, apart from 
composing projects, has not yet managed to do anything specific, 
means little to them. 
  There is also another undoubtedly brilliant personality in 
the country, who today has been undeservedly thrust into the 
backwaters of public life -- Yu.V. Skokov, the current chairman 
of the Federation of Russian Commodity Producers. It is hard to 
explain why he is out of favor with the powers that be, but it 
is even harder to explain why he is himself deliberately keeping 
to the shadows. Is this a subtle game? A tactical ruse: Let 
the irreconcilables "slug it out," and the enfeebled collapse? 
Time will answer these questions. 
  Here is the game of patience that is being played. There 
can, and probably will, be other names in this pack of 
candidates. Yegor Gaydar, on whose altar the main efforts and 
votes of the democrats will be placed, will not fail to try his 
hand, I think. It goes without saying that he has acquired huge 
public influence, plus there is his fine political education and 
lofty intellect. That experienced administrator, Moscow Mayor 
Yu. Luzhkov, also has chances of fighting for the highest state 
post. Indeed, even the current president could, as they say, 
shake his grey locks. But when it comes to the degree of broad 
renown and popular trust enjoyed by future candidates, the name 
of Rutskoy is today on everyone's lips. The numerous letters to 
the editorial offices are also, incidentally, a confirmation of 
this. 
  The fact that the authors of these letters are not members 
of 
the liberal intelligentsia or the capital's "gilded youth" 
trading in the kiosks strikes me as important; they are people 
remote from group or party prejudices; people of action. 
Perhaps this is the voice of reason and justice? 
  "Justice will remain on Rutskoy's side!" -- this is how M. 
Zimin, labor veteran of the Lenin Kolkhoz in Vladimir Oblast's 
Muromskiy Rayon headed his letter to the editorial offices. 
Whether this will be the case or not, time will tell. We have 
not long left to wait.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 5 TASS -- The Information Department of 
the Russian president's administration which was established by 
the presidential decree on Friday, is planning to publish a 
"white paper" on the October 1993 events in Moscow, Petr 
Filippov, head of the department, told ITAR-TASS in an exclusive 
interview. 
  According to Petr Filippov, "the main purpose of the 
department is to provide news media with objective and reliable 
materials on policies of the president, the government of the 
Russian Federation, and the most important socio-economic and 
political problems of reforming Russian society, and the 
measures taken for their settlement." 
  At the same time, the head of the Information Department 
stressed, "the department will in no way be a new department for 
propaganda of the cpsu central committee." 
  Petr Filippov was one of the organizers of establishing this 
department. Basing his views on the experience of the Czech 
Republic and other countries, he believes that the course of 
economic reforms advances faster in society in those cases when 
the population and news media receive full information on their 
implementation. 
  According to the head of the Information Department, now 
three problems cause the greatest concern. "First, the 
situation in agriculture connected with reforming unprofitable 
collective and state farms, and transforming an attitude towards 
ownership. Second, the problem of non-payments. The third, the 
problems of forming democracy in Russia, observing the 
Constitution and developing federalism," Petr Filippov pointed 
out. 
  Touching on the organization of the department's work, the 
department head said that working in this office will be mainly 
the same experts who worked with him in the analytical center on 
social policy. The staff of the department will be about 50 
people.

  [Text] One of the leaders of the opposition Working Russia 
Movement and Russian Workers' Communist Party Viktor Anpilov who 
was recently freed from jail under parliament-declared amnesty 
says he will not be resigned to the peace deal offered and 
"stand on his knees while being robbed". He was speaking at a 
meeting in Moscow on Saturday sponsored by the former opposition 
newspaper, DEN, closed by the government last October. 
  The meeting was also attended by other released opposition 
leaders including Ilya Konstantinov and Stanislav Terekhov as 
well as leaders of the Communist and Liberal-Democratic Parties 
Gennadiy Zyuganov and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. 
  One former Soviet deputy Mrs Saji Umalatova leading "the 
standing presidium of the Congress of People's Deputies of the 
USSR" claimed that "many innocent people are still behind bars" 
echoed previous calls on opponents to the Yeltsin regime to 
close their ranks regardless of difference in views. 
  For his part, chairman of the executive committee of the 
National Salvation Front Ilya Konstantinov who was also involved 
in last October's parliamentary revolt said that "our people are 
everywhere and biding their time". In his words, the opposition 
would "stand tall" again within months.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report in the "Resonance" column: "Viktor </F>
Chernomyrdin Denounces His High Rating. One Should Be Happy 
About This"] 
  [Text] Any politician in a civilized country is happy if 
his political weight (as reflected in particular in public 
opinion polls and expert surveys) grows. And it is only in the 
perverted Soviet (currently Russian) politics, more back-stage 
than open and fair, that this is feared. Moreover, attempts are 
even being made to cast a shadow on those who conduct and 
publish such polls. 
  In his speech the day before yesterday Viktor Chernomyrdin 
said among other things the following: 
  "I cannot but touch upon a problem that is extremely 
important both for myself in person and for the government I 
head. The fact is that recently a noisy campaign has been 
launched in certain news media aimed to `catch' the government 
chairman in allegedly concentrating power, taking too much on 
himself, and generally doing little short of hatching 
conspiracies to get to the presidential chair. They have even 
begun to build some rating charts on this score." 
  We know that there were words inserted into the report 
following the publication of the February NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA-VP 
"100 Politicians" rating. We venture to assure the prime 
minister that our survey, conduced for the last 14 months now, 
was not launched to set him against the president by February 
1994. Especially given that the two above mentioned statesmen 
have plenty of cause for such a quarrel without our NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA. This cause in particular is successfully being 
furthered by some pro-government and pro-presidential 
publications. Fortunately, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA does not belong 
to either. It is independent. This is printed in large-size 
letters on top of its first page.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Boris Yeltsin's address to the parliament has opened 
a new page in the mutual relations between the head of the state 
and the legislative power, believes presidential aide Georgiy 
Satarov. 
  In his exclusive interview with Interfax he pointed out that 
coordination of these structures' activity has actually begun. 
"The main thing which is being carried out in this aspect is 
coordination of economic platforms contained in the address and 
developed at the hearings in the State Duma's Economic Policy 
Committee." 
  Satarov reported that a joint work, being fulfilled by 
leader 
of the group of presidential economic experts Aleksandr Livshits 
and head of the parliament's lower chamber Sergey Glazyev, has 
started. In addition, other members of the "presidential team" 
also undertake joint moves together with representatives of the 
Duma's other committees. 
  Following the analysis of the situation after the adoption 
of 
the State Duma resolution on amnesty, the parliamentary 
structures have found a new model of interaction, noted Satarov. 
  "There is an agreement to create permanent working groups. 
Their task is to make active the initial stage of preparation 
of the most important legislative acts," he said. The question 
concerns, for example, federal constitutional laws, he explained 
and added that, as a rule, contradictions preventing efficient 
work appear at the initial stage. "We have discussed the new 
model of interaction with the Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin. I 
highly appreciate his statement during his recent meeting with 
Yeltsin when Rybkin said that the presidential and legislative 
structures have never before worked in such a close 
coordination," stressed Satarov. 
  In his opinion, "this spirit of a team" should become a 
norm. 
"The cliche -- president plus parliament equals confrontation -- 
is left in the past. The barricades on the way to a normal work 
have not been entirely removed, however, they do not appeal to 
anybody any more," underlined Satarov. 
  The democratic society on the way to formation can propose 
quite unusual "scenarios," said Satarov. For example, there may 
be situations when such forces as the president, parliament, and 
government will be forced to bar by some other means than 
earlier. [sentence as received] For example, the president and 
Duma will be forced to oppose the government on several issues, 
said Satarov. 
  Satarov also reported that in the near term the State Duma 
would receive a package of bills, 50 in number, which Boris 
Yeltsin proposes to consider in the parliament's lower chamber 
this year. As he said, these documents can be divided into three 
blocks. 
  The first one is connected with the continuation of the 
juridical reform and includes the Civil and Criminal Codes, 
several decrees on labor, magistrates, etc. The "economic" 
block is devoted to the bank system, to problems of securities, 
exchanges, and audits. The third package of documents concerns 
measures connected with building of a democratic society and, in 
particular, with legislature on political parties. 
  The president offers to the State Duma not only the list but 
the priority to consider these documents, explained Satarov. In 
the first block Yeltsin draws attention of deputies to the need 
to consider the Civil Code and legislative initiatives closely 
related to crime fighting. 
  Satarov said that among priority problems of the economic 
reform Yeltsin enumerates a package of acts connected with 
reformation of the bank activity and creation of Federal reserve 
system. 
  "If we could judge from the sharpness of debates to be waged 
around the contents of the third package, the draft decree on 
political parties will obviously become the central one," 
believes Satarov. Uncontrolled growth of parties, peculiar to 
Russia, becomes "a destabilizing factor in the life of the 
society," he said. The lawmaking itself should stimulate such a 
development of multiparty trends which will channel the process 
along the way of formation of a small number of strong parties, 
said Satarov.

  [Text] The head of the Russian presidential administration 
Sergey Filatov stated on Sunday that the president is expected 
to issue within a few days a decree regarding the formation of 
local self-government bodies. 
  Speaking to journalists, he noted that the document will 
take 
into account all recommendations of the presidential public 
chamber approved three weeks ago. These recommendations suggest 
extending election campaign in regions until June and not 
holding elections to local self-government bodies until the 
preparation of a corresponding legislative basis at the federal 
and regional levels. 
  Filatov pointed out that "the elections should not stick to 
a 
certain date and the issue of fixing it can be submitted to 
local governments". 
  Asked by IF's correspondent, the head of the administration 
said that the memorandum on civil accord, the need for which 
Boris Yeltsin stressed at an expanded meeting of the government 
last Friday can take a shape of a broad agreement between "the 
power, influential socio-political parties, entrepreneurs and 
trade unions". 
  In Filatov's opinion, the agreement could include the 
government's commitment to fight inflation, entrepreneurs' 
pledge to control growth of prices and trade unions' obligation 
to control strikes. 
  The head of the administration believes that such an 
agreement would considerably stabilize the situation by the 
beginning of the presidential election campaign in 1996. A 
working group for its preparation will be formed soon. 
  Filatov explained that warning the coup plotters amnestied 
by 
the resolution of the State Duma about their arrest in case of a 
new attempt to destabilize the situation in the country, the 
president did not mean a ban on any political activities. 
According to Filatov, the amnestied have the full right to such 
activities in civilized forms, including the right to be elected 
to the State Duma. 
  "If they start again to call for the ouster of the 
legitimate 
power at rallies, they will be punished", Filatov said.

  [Text] Moscow March 5 TASS -- "Allegations about a split in 
the ranks of the Liberal Democratic Party are groundless," party 
leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said. 
  Speaking at a meeting with his constituents near the 
Sokolnikiy metro station, northeast of Moscow, on Saturday, 
Zhirinovskiy praised the party faction in the parliament for 
supporting the resolution on amnesty which has released the 
leaders of the October 1993 revolt in Moscow from prison. He 
also said that two months of his party's activity in the 
parliament have resulted in "certain changes" in Russia's 
foreign policy with regard to Serbs. 
  He expressed the confidence that "the revived 
military-industrial complex of Russia can bring the country 
fantastic profits through selling weapons on the world market." 
The only thing Russia needs is "to learn how to trade" 
properly, he added.

  [Text] Moscow March 4 TASS -- Russian Minister for Affairs 
of Nationalities and Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray told an 
expanded government meeting here today money from the federal 
budget should be used to prevent inter-ethnic conflicts and not 
to settle them. 
  He reminded the meeting participants that the 
Ossetian-Ingush 
conflict alone required some 100 billion rubles in 1993. 
  Speaking of the division of powers between the center and 
regions, Shakhray said his ministry is preparing a treaty with 
the Kaliningrad region. However, he noted equality of regions 
does not mean their automatic identity. Some 60 per cent of 
federation subjects live on allocations. "Bearing this in mind, 
similar treaties with Russian territories will be elaborated," 
he said. 
  In the words of Shakhray, some 7,300,000,000 rubles worth of 
a fund will be formed to support northern areas. The money will 
be taken from the federal budget to help the delivery of prime 
necessities. A number of northern cities, including Norilsk, 
will be temporarily closed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Stepashin, new head of Russian </F>
Counterintelligence Service, by unidentified correspondent, 
place and date not given -- from the "Novosti" newscast; 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] It is said that either your service 
will be completely abolished, or you will be forced to surrender 
some of your very important units to, say, the Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations. 
  [Stepashin] I will not take part in that, that's clear, and 
I'll tell you straight that the special services will not go 
through another such perestroyka or katastroyka [pun on 
katastrofa, catastrophe]. I would like to stress once again -- 
this is very important for those who hear me, for our colleagues 
-- there will be no such perestroykas. But clearly, we should 
try and prove our importance and constantly say that we're 
necessary and important, not only and perhaps not so much by 
public statements, but by concrete actions and putting things 
into effect. I think you'll hear about many of them in March. 
  [Correspondent] Last week there was a meeting of the 
Security 
Council, and by all accounts you were given certain specific 
instructions for fighting corruption at the top levels of power. 
Could you reveal more specifically what kind of instructions 
these are, and is corruption really so strong that it has to be 
fought? 
  [Stepashin] It's always necessary to fight it. Specific 
instructions were indeed given there for the organs of 
counterintelligence to wage a determined fight not only against 
corruption at the top levels of state power, which you asked 
about, but also against banditry. By the way, we already have a 
number of very serious things projected and implemented in these 
terms, especially for St. Petersburg. 
  [Correspondent] In this regard, how will you cooperate with 
Primakov's department? 
  [Stepashin] Just as before. By the way, we have a very good 
level of cooperation, especially in terms of intelligence from 
the territories. We are developing a general strategy. I would 
draw your attention to some of the things we have done recently. 
We have agreed to hold a joint meeting this month with Boris 
Nikolayevich -- that is, our service, the intelligence service, 
the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff, 
Starovoytov of the Federal Agency of Government Communications 
and Information, and the border troops -- in order to reach 
agreement on closer cooperation, together with the national 
security adviser, and to create, if you like, a kind of 
prototype intelligence community.

  [Text] As has already been reported, last Thursday 
Russia's Security Council approved a federal program to combat 
crime. From reliable sources it has become known that the 
Russian Federation's Ministry of Internal Affairs has sent a 
secret circular to the provinces which contains the instruction 
"to prepare for the suppression (!) of crime in conditions of a 
state of emergency." According to certain information, similar 
documents have been drafted in all power structures. 
  Professional criminologists questioned by a KOMSOMOLSKAYA 
PRAVDA correspondent assure us that formulations like 
"suppression of crime" [podavleniye prestupnosti] have not been 
encountered in official papers since wartime. In the opinion of 
those people we talked with, the next fews days should see a 
number of legislative initiatives designed to provide a legal 
foundation for emergency measures.

  [Text] The Russian Communications Ministry has prepared a 
draft government resolution granting Russia's TV and radio 
companies an order for broadcasting state-sponsored programs at 
the expense of the federal budget allocations set aside for this 
purpose and taking into account the indexation of the rates, the 
chairman of the executive committee of the communications sector 
workers' union, Anatoliy Nazeykin, told Interfax today. 
  Nazeykin said the draft resolution submitted for 
consideration by First Vice Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets 
envisions allocating funds to TV and radio broadcasting 
companies for them to prepare programs and communications 
enterprises for their distribution services. 
  According to the document, TV and broadcasting companies 
will 
have to remove commercials from the state air time. They will 
be broadcast at other time at commercial prices. Re-selling air 
time is expected to be prohibited. 
  Nazeykin said it still remained unknown whether the document 
will be approved by the government. 
  As for the state's debt to communications sector workers 
worth 65.9 Bn [Billion] rubles which made them cut down air time 
in many regions of Russia on February 10, the money has been 
paid out, according to Nazeykin.

of Russian State Television and Radio Company, outside the

  [Text] [Peslyak] Being decided in this building today is 
the question of whether Russian Television will continue to 
exist; whether you will watch us or not, and whether we know you 
are watching us. 
  [Lozhkin] No meeting with the heads of the Ministry of 
Finance took place, but according to the information we have 
received, the Finance Ministry's position remained unchanged. 
It will meet about one quarter of the 1994 finance needs of 
Russian television and radio. 
  [Peslyak] According to Anatoliy Lysenko, as a result only 
news and childrens' programs will be left, along with a few 
things on health and for pensioners, nothing more. No films or 
shows! 
  [Lysenko] The destruction of Russian radio and television, 
which comrade Anpilov and DEN have spoken so much about, is 
indeed taking place. 
  [Peslyak] We are talking about Russian Television, but is 
the 
First Channel involved here too? What will happen to Ostankino? 
  [Lysenko] Exactly the same, just the same! I talked to 
Aleksandr Nikolayevich Yakovlev today. Broadcasting there is, 
altogether...[pauses] Well, we'll just have to get used to two 
hours or an hour of television at a time, which will be 
exclusively information. 
  [Peslyak] The practice of lobbying exists all over the 
world, 
and there are powerful lobbyists in Russia, too -- 
agro-industrial lobbyists, lobbyists from the military 
industrial complex, and from defense. We, though, are hoping 
for help from millions of television viewers and radio 
listeners: They can influence deputies and the government.

<F P=106> [Natalya Osipova report: "Television Funding Cut. Unlike </F>
the Government, Oleg Poptsov Still Holds Television Dear"] 
  [Text] Oleg Poptsov, chairman of the Russian Television 
Company, told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent yesterday 
about his vision of the new situation in the electronic media 
that emerged after the budget financing of television companies 
was slashed nearly four-fold against the requisite level. 
  Television and radio company chiefs were invited to attend 
yesterday's government meeting. According to Oleg Poptsov, 
President Yeltsin dwelled on the electronic media in his 
address. His statement was in line with the ambiguous stance he 
expressed in his message to the Federal Assembly on 24 February: 
The state is no longer able to finance television and radio 
companies, but it is "important to make sure that Russia's 
information space is not torn apart and divided in the course of 
practical steps. A state television and radio channel must be 
preserved." 
  The financial support the state is able to give the mass 
media this year, however, will hardly be enough to preserve the 
"information space." For instance, under a tentative agreement 
with the Finance Ministry, the "Ostankino" State Television and 
Radio Company could receive no more than 653 billion rubles [R] 
for 1994 instead of the R1.2 trillion it had requested. The 
Russian Television and Radio Company received R471 billion 
instead of the requested R910 billion. But now the initial 
two-fold cut has turned out to be four-fold. The Finance 
Ministry is going to appropriate only R679 billion for the 
federal companies, including "Ostankino," the Russian Television 
and Radio Company, and local television and radio companies. 
  In Mr. Poptsov's view, these cuts in government subsidies 
show that the government's "mechanism of assessing priories is 
out of balance," and if the authorities do not see the mass 
media as a priority, "the cabinet must have lost either its 
hearing or its eyesight. Russia is still governed by the word, 
which alone can say if there are deeds in Russia or not." 
  Mr. Poptsov said that he did not oppose joint-stock 
television companies, but he thinks that an across-the-board 
conversion into joint-stock companies is contra-indicated for 
Russian television groups. At any rate, in his opinion, the 
state should not quit the game so obviously. "It is possible," 
Mr. Poptsov noted, "that a lobby pursuing the interests of 
commercial businesses is trying to clear the 'television field' 
for a large-scale penetration. Naturally, the four-fold decrease 
in financing (and, hence, in air time) will mean that the volume 
of information on the government will be slashed 
proportionately: Why should we sacrifice movies or other 
programs that hold much greater interest for viewers."

  [Text] Yegor Gaydar, leader of the State Duma faction 
Russia's Choice, believes that there are "substantial 
discrepancies between those numbers mentioned by the Russian 
president in his address to the Federal Assembly on February 24 
and numbers voiced by the prime minister at the extended sitting 
of the government on March 4." 
  "This contradictions concern the inflation's 
reference-points, the key aspect of the 1994 economic policy; 
the thing is that they are not of a quantitative but of a 
qualitative nature," he underlined during his conversation with 
journalists on Friday. 
  According to Gaydar, the presidential address "lays hope at 
least for a relative opportunity to reach monetary stability 
this year, it gives hope to stabilize volumes of production and 
create premises for its further growth;" at the same time the 
analysis of the budget submitted by the government "leaves no 
hopes for this." 
  Speaking about prospects of the budget's consideration in 
the 
State Duma, Gaydar said that "he is absolutely convinced that 
the branch ministers will themselves, or via their 
representatives in parliamentary committees, urge to increase 
appropriations for all possible articles." "I am afraid that 
this will result in a proposal to increase the budget deficit to 
20-30 Tn rubles," he said. 
  As far as Russia's Choice faction is concerned, it will not 
back the budget during its discussion in the Duma if "serious 
corrections in the structure and volume of expenditures" 
primarily aimed at "lowering of the general level of state 
pressure on the budget" are not introduced into it," said 
Gaydar. 
  Responding to Interfax, Gaydar said that even after the 
government's program is made public it will be hard for him to 
make any political prognosis for 1994. "A political prognosis, 
as well as an economic one, does not depend upon public speeches 
but upon concrete economic decision. Decisions adopted by the 
government even during the last few days surprisingly contradict 
to each other," said Gaydar.

  [Text] Moscow March 4 TASS -- Controlled inflation is 
better than production recession, head of the Russian Central 
Bank Viktor Gerashchenko told today an expanded government 
meeting. 
  Gerashchenko criticized "the policy of economic 
stabilization 
through lower inflation favored by the Ministry of Finance". He 
also against [as received] a policy of financial encouragement 
of all productions. "This will not lead to long-term 
stabilization with the subsequent production boom but result in 
even greater inflation", he said. 
  Gerashchenko dwelt on major economic indices of 1993. In his 
opinion, "the most viable sector of the reformed economy is, 
paradoxically, the agro-industrial complex". In his words, the 
agricultural production recession was only four per cent in 
1993, which is only 87 per cent of 1990. 
  Speaking of the activities of commercial banks, the bank 
chairman noted their "passiveness due to the uncertainty in 
which branches to invest". The bank chairman actually admitted 
the government has insufficiently elaborated the industrial 
policy.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Petrenko] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 4 TASS -- A statement of Central Bank 
Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko that "controlled inflation is 
better than large-scale unemployment" is a false dilemma, 
Director of the Institute of Transitional Economy Yegor Gaydar 
told ITAR-TASS here today. 
  In his opinion, unemployment can be kept in check for 
two-five months with higher inflation and monetary injections, 
but this course has no long-term prospects. 
  "If the economy is not stable and there is no stable money, 
unemployment will increase anyway and we will have an unpleasant 
combination of jobless and high inflation," said Gaydar. 
  Speaking of the draft budget, he noted the difference 
between 
the message's indices and the ones named today by the prime 
minister. In his opinion, the main difference is approaches to 
the inflation -- a key aspect of the 1994 economic policy. They 
are rather qualitative than quantitative. The presidential 
message inspires hope for an economic breakthrough and stability 
and the government indices are not optimistic. 
  The budget deficit is estimated at approximately 10.2 per 
cent of the gross domestic product, the level of 1993, which 
means the inflation will not decrease. 
  Gaydar personally would not vote for the document until 
certain changes are introduced in its spending section. The 
draft provides for doubled spending on the state machinery and 
the military-industrial complex simultaneously with the reduced 
social spending.

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Slavin: "One Must Not Look Down on the </F>
People"] 
  [Text] These words, directed against the activity of 
Gaydar and his government team, were uttered yesterday by Viktor 
Chernomyrdin at an enlarged session of the Russian Cabinet of 
Ministers. What did these words imply? Was he totally 
dissociating himself from those reponsible for the "shock 
therapy" or just gently criticizing them? 
  Although appearing radical, Chernomyrdin's speech only went 
halfway. On the one hand, there was the apparent intention to 
strengthen Russian statehood and create conditions for economic, 
political, and social stability in society. On the other hand, 
the premier does not see any grounds or any potential "for 
radically changing the course" mapped out last August. But what 
about the fact that the people voted against the former policy 
of reforms, which led to impoverishment and the collapse of the 
economy? There was no clear answer to this question in 
Chernomyrdin's report. 
  The government head is trying to justify his moderately 
tough 
financial policy in 1993, although he is perfectly well aware 
that the temporary slowing of the inflation rate was artificial 
and was due not to production growth but to the delayed payment 
of workers' and employees' wages, reduced credit opportunities 
for enterprises, and artificial unemployment. January showed 
that inflation is rising rather than falling. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin, while criticizing the monetarists, is 
nonetheless not seeking a solution via the proven models of 
economic development in China., Japan, South Korea, and so on. 
He is trying to find a happy medium between Gaydar's monetarist 
experiments and the former party apparatchiks' administrative 
methods of management. Hence the desire to combine 
liberalization of prices and foreign trade with stronger state 
power and the establishment of order and discipline. 
  Of course, the government's desire to orient the reforms 
toward the people and eliminate the main sources of their 
discontent can only be welcomed. But how is all this to be 
done? That is the question. But the measures proposed by the 
prime minister will not be welcomed by the critically minded 
reader. It is still totally unclear why, for example, 
agricultural subsidies, which are granted in all developed 
countries, "will pose a threat to other sectors of the economy" 
here, according to Chernomyrdin. 
  Similar contradictions are to be encountered throughout the 
prime minister's report. For example, how can you reduce the 
budget deficit and at the same time increase investments in 
industry, combat mass unemployment, and close industrial 
enterprises that have not performed from the monetarist 
viewpoint? Of course, it is a good thing that war and labor 
veterans' pensions are to be increased. But what about current 
science and culture, education, and medicine? Judging by the 
report, the government will not get round to them. 
  The premier gave assurances that there will be no economic 
and social catastrophe this year, that stabilizaiton is in the 
offing. We would like to believe it, but, unfortunately, the 
report provided no substantial evidence of this. The one thing 
the report did make clear was that our president is alive and 
well and neither the former laboratory head nor the current 
prime minister should aim to supplant him. You will agree that 
this is not enough for the country's future, for general accord, 
or for democracy.

<F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report under the "Debates" rubric: </F>
"Aleksandr Lifshits Promises No Price and Wage Freeze. Sectoral 
Ministers Will Get Economic Freedom Instead of Money"] 
  [Text] Aleksandr Lifshits, head of the Russian Federation 
president's economic experts group, one of the writers of the 
presidential message, stressed in his press conference yesterday 
that Viktor Chernomyrdin's speech at the Council of Ministers 
enlarged session "was fully proceeding along the channel of the 
presidential message as regards all the postulates and 
priorities." Lifshits told about "signals" attesting to "a 
great degree of understanding by State Duma deputies of the new 
economic program," announced by the president and the premier. 
  Saying this, Aleksandr Lifshits, however, vouched: 
"According to my lights...prices and wages are not supposed to 
be frozen," something most people in the Duma talk about as a 
fact decided on by Chernomyrdin's government. "I have seen all 
the recent government documents -- there are definitely no such 
things in there," Lifshits said. In the meantime he recognized 
that "in the government apparatus, there are such top-class 
artists that there already exist several various projects for 
freezing prices." Lifshits termed their implementation as 
"madness owing to their being impossible to carry out 
technically -- they will pull the wool over your eyes but 
nothing will come of it all the same." 
  Besides, Lifshits hopes the government will not cave in to 
"the pressure of local commodity producers" who demand 
protection from foreign goods "by such crude methods as colossal 
customs tariffs." 
  The experts group head also expressed the hope that "the 
budget will still not be made to provide for a 12-15 percent 
deficit." He affirmed that these figures were named in the 
Council of Ministers presidium session where the budget was 
discussed. 
  Sectoral ministers "who, one by one, clamored for money in 
that session and stated: cut down on funds for anyone else but 
me, while they irritably motioned to a grinning Andrey Kokoshin 
[first deputy defense minister]," according to Lifshits were not 
"a sight for nervous folks." Lifshits believes that one can 
only hope that during the week the government "revises" the 
budget, it will make up its mind to "give, instead of money 
(which is not there), economic freedom, which still does not 
exist."

  [Text] Russia's First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets declared 
that the transfer of management functions to regions should be 
well balanced because as many as 60% of Russia's 
territories 
use various forms of state subsidies. He declared about this at 
the press conference held on Friday evening in Moscow. As he 
said, subventions to territories "represent the greatest problem 
today." 
  He also pointed out that due to privatization which is being 
implemented in a wrong way, currently "many important 
enterprises have appeared without a real owner." "A working 
staff cannot be an owner," emphasized Soskovets and said that 
respect towards working staffs should be demonstrated in timely 
issuance of wages and several other measures but not in the 
transfer of enterprises to them. 
  Soskovets laid great hope for the second stage of the 
privatization which, as he said, "will help to remove many 
problems" by means of organizing large investment funds for 
industry. 
  Soskovets mentioned defense, state borders guarding, and 
security of domestic producer as the major functions to be 
preserved by the state. "This security is an extremely 
important measure which has been unjustly forgotten," said he.

  [Text] Moscow March 4 TASS -- Defence expenditures is no 
shredding of taxpayers' money into stockpiles of weapons, First 
Deputy Defence Minister Andrey Kokoshin said in an interview 
with ITAR-TASS here on Friday. 
  He noted that "social appropriations are now responsible for 
70 per cent of the entire defence budget". According to the 
deputy minister, whole cities which mushroomed next to munitions 
factories, are maintained at the expense of the defence order. 
  Kokoshin stressed that "the intention of the Finance 
Ministry 
to cut considerably the defence order this year may result in a 
collapse of key defence industries and will negatively tell on 
the fate of 15 million people". 
  In Kokoshin's opinion, even the present defence order "is 
below the requirements of the Armed Forces". 
  He underlined that the Defence Ministry is guided by the 
need 
to preserve the main high-tech industries. The deputy minister 
"had in mind industries manufacturing both military products and 
civil technologies. 
  He pointed to the need for enlisting investments in the 
defence complex from the non-state sector. "We need major 
enterprises and industrial-financial groups. In future, many 
types of weapons can be financed with inner funds," he explained. 
  Kokoshin also noted that cuts for defence "can negatively 
tell on the export of Russian weaponry". In his opinion, "the 
difficult position at our enterprises will undermine Russian 
export positions".

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin 
believes that insufficient understanding of the importance of 
the needs of the Army and of its role in society today is the 
key to the conflict between the Finance Ministry and the Defense 
Ministry over the budget. Kokoshin believes that, on the one 
hand, a decreased defense order may bring about the collapse of 
major manufacturers of defense products and negatively affect 
the 15 million people employed by the military industrial 
complex. On the other hand, a strong army is a guarantor of 
success in implementing economic and political reforms today. 
Though we do not have any external enemies any longer, the 
Armed Forces now have a direct effect--albeit not immediately 
obvious for ordinary people--on the social and economic 
situation in the country by preserving a certain, though 
fragile, balance in local conflicts in Tajikistan and the 
Caucasian region. 
  [Begin Kokoshin recording] There is a danger of these 
conflicts expanding and getting out of control, of their gradual 
transformation into large-scale wars. Of course, the intensity 
may vary at different stages, but they would have the most 
negative effect on the internal stability in Russia. Should we 
fail to keep in check the situation in those countries, imagine 
what would happen if Russia were flooded by millions of 
refugees. [end recording] 
  Kokoshin asserts that the Defense Ministry is not being 
excessive in its demands, asking only for those resources that 
would ensure the healthy operation of the Armed Forces and the 
fulfillment of the defense order that has already been approved. 
Incidentally, 70 percent of the expenditures are being 
allocated for social needs. Social unrest among the military may 
upset stability of the state itself.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 5 Mar -- Russia has completed work on 
elaborating the concept of the destruction of toxic chemical 
agents. The elimination of chemical weapons will start after 
parliament has ratified the international convention on the 
destruction of chemical weapons, signed in January 1993, Colonel 
Viktor Kholstov, doctor of chemistry and deputy chief of the 
radiation, chemical, and biological protection troops, told the 
ITAR-TASS corespondent. He said that the convention may come 
into force from January 1995 if 65 world states sign and ratify 
it before this July. 
  According to this document, a signatory undertakes not to 
carry out any new development. Viktor Kholstov stated that 
chemical weapons are not being destroyed anywhere yet. All 
agents are in special arsenals, are well guarded, and do not 
represent a threat to the environment. If munitions become 
defective, V. Kholstov continued, Russia has a unique unit that 
makes it possible to neutralize them. This unit is without 
parallel and was inspected by 40 world delegations who saw for 
themselves how reliable it is. 
  As far as a national program for the elimination of chemical 
weapons is concerned, in Viktor Kholstov's opinion, it is 
necessary both for the adoption of political decisions and to 
substantiate financial outlays. 
  After the convention is ratified, the state is obliged to 
completely destroy over 10 years all chemical weapons on its 
territory, Colonel Kholstov said. This requires special 
facilities and specific financing. Such a draft program was 
drawn up while the USSR still existed, but the implementation of 
the measures it prescribed was thwarted for various reasons. 
For instance, the facility built near Chapayevsk was not made 
operational due to mass protests from the population, which was 
deliberately misinformed by certain groupings for their own ends. 
  The program was taken up again in 1992 after Boris Yeltsin 
stated that Russia had inherited earlier disarmament commitments. 
  Around two dozen ministeries and departments and several 
hundred specialists have been involved in drawing up the new 
version of the program. The government has allocated resources 
for testing the technology, and Russian and American scientists 
and engineers inspected the Chapayevsk facility near Samara for 
safety. 
  Authorative commissions of experts assessed the facility 
highly and recommended that similar facilties be set up in other 
regions of the country. 
  In reply to a question by the ITAR-TASS correspondent as to 
whether new types of chemical weapons were being developed, 
Viktor Kholstov said that nobody would be so brave as to assert 
that no such work was being undertaken abroad. "Russia is not 
violating international agreements, but the strengthening of 
national security lies within its scope just as it does in any 
sovereign, self-respecting state."

<F P=106> [Ravil Mustafin report: "That `Morning After Feeling' in </F>
the Ames Case"] 
  [Text] Albeit with difficulty, it seems that sober voices 
in America are making themselves heard above the frenzied cries 
raised on the subject of the Ames case. Attention should be 
focused primarily on what is happening in the CIA, not on Russia 
-- this, in rough terms, is the leitmotiv of statements heard in 
recent days from a number of American politicians and 
intelligence experts. Ames should have been exposed during lie 
detector tests, THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER writes. Apparently 
Ames underwent two such tests -- in 1986 and in 1991 -- during 
which he was asked whether he had unauthorized contacts with 
foreign intelligence services. 
  It is not impossible that the slight sobering of public 
opinion in the United States is connected with the fragility of 
the accusation. In the opinion of the influential WALL STREET 
JOURNAL, it will be quite difficult to reach a guilty verdict 
insofar as all evidence of the Ames' guilt is circumstantial. 
The only weak link in the Ames' defense is their financial 
position, William Cummings, legal adviser for the accused, 
believes. 
  However, even here things are not so bad for the Ames. For 
instance, the house which cost them over $500,000 was bought 
back in 1987. Our experts consider it unlikely that Ames could 
have obtained such a sum at that time, even taking account of 
the value of the information he may have obtained and sold. 
Provided, of course, it was indeed in 1985 that he started to 
work for a foreign intelligence service, and not before. 
  A highly original version was put forward by the American 
newspaper DAILY NEWS. Its journalists concluded that Ames was 
an agent for the Cuban intelligence services since his time in 
Mexico at the start of the 1980's coincided with a series of 
failures by American agents working against Havana.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Tatyana Viktorovna Samolis, press </F>
secretary of Russian Foreign Intelligence Service director, by 
Vitaliy Gan; date not given; from the "Panorama" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Gan] The tension in Russian-American relations 
caused by the arrest of the CIA staff member Aldrich Ames and 
his wife on charges of spying for Russia is intensifying. The 
sides have already exchanged compliments in the form of a 
reciprical expulsion of diplomats or those who were considered 
to be diplomats. The turn of events is a rather a suprising 
one. Bill [Clinton] and Boris [Yeltsin] had pledged friendship 
in the eyes of the world and now here we are faced with this 
embarrassment. On the American side the fuss is due to many 
factors: the striving to block the establishment of closer 
political and economic ties with Russia, the opposition to 
President Clinton, the dissatisfaction with our efforts to state 
once again, as it should be, our position and our place in the 
world in spite of our internal squabbles. It is also due to the 
cherished desire to put a squeeze on the Russian intelligence 
service. 
  Tatyana Viktorovna Samolis, Russian foreign intelligence 
service director's press secretary, is our guest today. 
  Tatyana Viktorovna, the fuss around the arrest of CIA staff 
member Ames and his wife on charges of spying against [as heard] 
Russia is not subsiding. One gets the impression that by 
carrying out reciprocal expulsions the sides have revived the 
eye-for-an-eye policy. How do you see the situation? 
  [Samolis] First of all, I would not define the situation 
that 
has emerged as fitting the eye-for-an-eye scheme. To a certain 
extent we have here a different variant. Why? Primarily 
because we consider the expulsion of Aleksandr Iosifovich 
Lisenko as a discourteous act. This was, most likely, a 
political step and the Russian side was forced to undertake a 
reciprical measure, first and foremost, because the expulsion of 
Lisenko was carried out not out of any operational 
consideration. Then, whoever Ames really was, Lisenko had had 
no contacts with him whatsoever. All this situation is to a 
certain extent burdensome to both the sides. The Russian side 
would not like to drag out this conflict. On the contrary, we 
would like, by using all means, to strive to return to the 
cooperation which has already begun between the Russian and U.S. 
intelligence services, because the interests that coincide 
between our states are relatively sufficient in number and the 
sphere in which we could cooperate is broad. The world is a 
complex place and very dangerous and there are problems that can 
be resolved only by applying joint efforts. 
  [Gan] You know that, according to some information, Ames's 
main aim was in preventing the CIA doing harm to Russia and 
Russia's agents; in other words, to ensure our security but not 
to sell and disclose U.S. secrets. Is this so? 
  [Samolis] First, I would like to say that the Russian 
intelligence service is not going to comment on the Ames case. 
This is a practice adopted by all the intelligence services. 
This we should make clear to ourselves. 
  As for your question, on the whole, you are right, to some 
extent. One could possibly agree with you here. In any case, 
if one analyzes the U.S. press, a sufficient number of 
suppositions on this matter have been expressed, including one 
which can be expressed in the following way: to Ames it was most 
likely not a operation to penerate U.S. secrets but a 
counterintelligence measure, a protective measure and a 
defensive measure for the country which he was acquiring the 
secrets for. Once again, this is without commenting on the 
situation itself. The court will decide everything. 
  [Gan] There is another question. It is well known that the 
CIA is actively involved in intelligence activities on the 
territory of Russia. The other day, CIA Director James Wolsey, 
on the whole, openly recognized this. It looks like everybody 
is engaged in this kind of game. One could then ask why is it 
necessary, generally speaking, to aggravate and poison the 
relations between our countries which are already complicated? 
  [Samolis] Yes, you are right here. This was said by the CIA 
director and not only by him. Many senior officials had made 
such remarks, including the chairmen of the committees for 
intelligence services of the Senate and the House of 
Representatives. On the whole, many people look at this in an 
absolutely normal way. What can be done about this if the world 
is made like that? The world is not a safe place and it is 
quite natural that states cannot do without such a function as 
the intelligence services. 
  I would also like to speak about some small trivial things. 
We would not like the Russian proverb that says what the priest 
is allowed the deacon is not, to be applied to Russia. If the 
world is a complicated place and is not safe for the United 
States, the same would be right for Russia and for another 
country; am I right? 
  [Gan] Yes, of course. 
  [Samolis] Russia has also its own national interests, no 
matter how strange this might seem. It will continue to defend 
them by also using intelligence methods. 
  Second, I would to remind you of or maybe acquaint you for 
the first time with one of the thoughts of Richard Helms, a 
former CIA director, who once cleverly and ironically remarked 
that they very well knew that their friends were watching them. 
The only thing they could blame their spies and foreign spies 
for was for allowing themselves to be caught redhanded. 
  By the way, speaking about the Ames case, I am obliged to 
remind us all that he was not caught redhanded. But I said this 
in connection with another matter: carrying out intelligence 
activities in the present civilized world is, in no way at all, 
an obstacle to upholding friendly and even allied relations 
between states. That is why I do not quite understand all the 
noise around this case and the attempt to raise this problem 
from a solely professional level to a supreme political level.

  [Text] The new director of the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service (FCS), Sergey Stepashin, has described the speculations 
that FCS was carrying out an internal investigation or made any 
arrests in the wake of the Ameses case as a conjecture. In an 
interview with INTERFAX today, he said that apart from the 
neighbors' suppositions of their disproportional expenses, the 
Americans have no other evidence to prove that the Ameses worked 
for the Russian intelligence. 
  Stepashin said he had met with Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin shortly before he was appointed as FCS director, but he 
declined to give any comments on it. 
  Asked whether the Russian special service will be reformed 
once again, Stepashin said it was "quite a natural thing" under 
the conditions when society is going through dramatic changes. 
At the same time, he pointed out that the president's bid to 
carry out no more purges in counterintelligence officers in 
order not to squander the potential was strictly observed during 
the present reformation. 
  Stepashin hoped that FCS will manage to retain its 
high-class 
professionals, and that they will efficiently fulfil their tasks. 
  According to the FCS director, Russia needs a stronger 
special service capable of ensuring the state's security.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Lashch report: "British Spy in Russia Scandal. Spy </F>
Operated Since 1986." 
  [Text] Your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent learned 
yesterday from sources close to Russian counterintelligence some 
details about the Russian SMM defense concern employee, arrested 
by the counterintelligence organs, who had passed on secret 
military information to British special services. It became 
known in particular that the man suspected of spying since 1986 
is Vadim Sintsov, director of an SMM administration. According 
to information received by KOMMERSANT-DAILY, he was detained 
with his partner, Mikhaylov. 
  KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned that the detained man, Vadim 
Sintsov, used to be in charge of an administration in the USSR 
Defense Industry Ministry. Following the collapse of the 
ministries catering to defense, he joined the SMM concern as 
head of one of the directorates for foreign economic 
cooperation. His former colleagues in the concern characterize 
Sintsov as an extremely sociable staffer. Besides, according to 
one of his former colleagues, Sintsov was fluent in English, 
knew computer technology well, and was brilliantly conversant in 
the ways of the Russian armaments and military hardware market. 
  Yevgeniy Pershikov, SMM deputy president, in a talk with 
your 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent confirmed that the English spy 
detained by the counterintelligence service had worked for the 
concern, and was in charge of a directorate for foreign economic 
relations. He stressed, however, that the SMM concern does not 
possess any classified materials: "We have not had classified 
materials for two years; even our first departments have been 
closed down." Pershikov is confident that even if Sintsov was 
indeed engaged in spying, he was doing so outside the concern. 
  That the detained man is precisely Vadim Sintsov was neither 
confirmed nor denied to your correspondent at the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service press center. A press service 
officer explained that the English spy case is being 
investigated by the military procuracy. 
  Your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent turned to the head of a 
directorate of the Security Council apparatus to determine the 
size of the damage and the nature of the information that Vadim 
Sintsov had passed on to British special services. The official 
said that, to his knowledge, Sintsov showed the greatest 
activity in 1991 to 1993. However, he said, owing to the fact 
that no important research and development projects were 
undertaken by the defense sector at that time, British special 
services used him in secondary roles: military information 
coming to English intelligence services was checked up on 
through him. Besides, Sintsov had no access to either materials 
on the main defense development projects or to the secret 
provisions of the military doctrine concerning its 
military-technology section. "The value of information Sintsov 
passed on to British special services has been artificially 
overestimated. At any rate, the comparison to Penkovskiy and 
Tolkachev is exaggeration," the Security Council apparatus 
official thinks.

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Ukrainian Nuclear Disarmament Has </F>
Begun"] 
  [Text] An event of which there has so long been so much 
talk in the capitals of three major countries -- Washington, 
Moscow, and Kiev -- has finally happened: Russia and Ukraine 
have begun implementing the trilateral accord signed in the 
Kremlin 14 January on the partial transfer of the nuclear 
warheads of strategic missiles and of strategic bomber cruise 
missiles to Russian territory for subsequent dismantling and 
salvaging. 
  They are not revealing the details of the current operation, 
its schedule, or the size of the transfers, citing the secrecy 
and security requirements stipulated in a special document. But 
independent experts maintain that the secret [liternyy] trains 
taking the nuclear warheads out of Ukraine must be taking 
several dozen warheads previously removed from SS-19 liquid-fuel 
strategic missiles of the 43d Missile Army's 46th Missile 
Division, which are in a pre-malfunction state. 
  Special cars are bringing elements for Ukrainian nuclear 
electric power stations to meet these trains. 
  According to information at the disposal of the editorial 
office, at least some 200 strategic missile warheads are to be 
removed from Ukrainian territory to Russian plants during the 10 
months of this year. In return, Ukraine will receive by way of 
compensation, as a first real step, 100 tonnes of slightly 
enriched uranium in the form of those very fuel assemblies for 
its nuclear power industry. 
  It is no coincidence that these March days have been 
selected 
to start the removal of nuclear warheads from Ukrainian 
territory. At the time the secret train crossed Russia's border 
with specific weapons and headed deep into the country, toward 
the plants where they will be dismantled and salvaged, Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk was meeting with Bill Clinton. He had 
something to report in Washington. 
  The trilateral Moscow accord is being fulfilled. This 
attests that Kiev and Moscow are serious about the obligations 
they have assumed.

  [Text] Moscow, 7 Mar -- The management of the Russian 
joint-stock company Gazprom has suspended cuts in natural gas 
supplies to Ukraine pending the start of negotiations on 10 
March, Sergey Tyukin, deputy head of Gazprom's central control 
directorate, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent today. 
  This means that until the the issue of paying off debts for 
fuel supplied from Russia is resolved conclusively, Ukrainian 
consumers will be receiving reduced amounts of gas. At present, 
consumers in Ukraine are getting about 100 million cubic meters 
of gas a day from Russia. 
  Sergey Tyukin also said that daily supplies of gas to 
Belarus 
have been increased by 10 million cubic meters. After gas 
supplies from Russia were reduced by 20 million cubic meters, 
Belarus consumers promptly managed to start paying off their 
debts and transferred 30 billion rubles into Gazprom's account. 
  In Sergey Tyukin's words, despite the difficult situation 
Gazprom has found itself in, it managed to maintain virtually 
the full volume of gas supplies to its foreign partners. The 
exports of Russian gas fell by just 5 percent over the past few 
days.

  [Text] Moscow, 4 Mar -- Belarus has guaranteed that the 
transit of export supplies of gas from Russia to foreign 
countries across its territory will continue, despite the fact 
that Russia has reduced its supply of gas to Belarus. An 
ITAR-TASS correspondent learned this today from Vladimir 
Podmarkov, the chief engineer of the Gasprom Company Central 
Control Directorate. According to Russia's Gazprom, even after 
the cut the amount of natural gas being delivered to Belarus is 
enough to meet all the requirements of the public utilities 
system.

  [Text] Moscow March 5 TASS -- Western consumers of Russian 
natural gas may remain without the fuel if Ukraine continues to 
pump out gas from transit pipelines going to Europe via its 
territory, TASS learned on Saturday [5 March] from experts of 
the "Gazprom" concern, the major Russian natural gas supplier. 
  The pressure dropped by five atmospheres on Tuesday 
afternoon 
in transit gas pipelines near Ukrainian border with European 
countries and experts are sure that there is only one reason for 
that -- Ukraine is pumping out fuel after Russia began cutting 
down supplies to it demanding that debts for previous deliveries 
be paid. 
  If the pressure falls by other five atmospheres, West 
European consumers may remain without the Russian fuel, 
"Gazprom" experts warned and added that in this case they would 
have to decrease gas supplies for purely technological reasons. 
  The experts are sure that gas supplies will be further 
decreased already today also because no debt payments had been 
yet received from Ukraine. 
  Today Russia continued natural gas supplies to Ukraine and 
Belarus in reduced volumes, but refrained from further cuts so 
far, according to chief engineer of the main dispatcher 
department of "Gazprom" Vladimir Podmarkov.

  [Text] Russia's Minister for Fuel and Energy Yuriy 
Shafranik told Interfax in an exclusive interview that the role 
of the state was overly exaggerated in the sphere of energy 
supplies. He believes that this is a matter of relations 
between the suppliers and consumers not only in Russia but also 
abroad, including the CIS countries. 
  He categorically denied the assertions that Russia was 
manipulating difficulties in this sphere in order to save energy 
for its own needs. 
  We must get used to the idea that according to the market 
laws energy supplies must be regulated during talks between the 
supplier and consumer. The state, including the Ministry for 
Energy and Fuel, must not be involved in tackling such problems. 
  Speaking about cuts in Russian gas exports to Ukraine, he 
emphasized that they had been caused by the Ukrainian consumers' 
debts, not by problems in Russian-Ukrainian relations.

  [Text] Russia's deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin, 
Russian president's special envoy, declared to INTERFAX on 
Friday [4 March] that he "is concerned and even insulted" by 
negative reaction of several Moslem leaders in Bosnia with 
respect to the agreement to open the airport in Tuzla reached 
with the leader of the Bosnian Serbs Radovan Karadzic several 
days ago in Moscow. 
  "This move will primarily correspond to the interests of the 
Moslem population," he pointed out. 
  Churkin expressed a supposition that several leaders of the 
Bosnian Moslems probably thought "that the airport in Tuzla will 
be used for military transportations. These are people who wish 
war but not peace." 
  At the same time Churkin expressed the opinion that "most 
authoritative and serious Moslem leaders want peace and this is 
the reason of the visit of the premier of the Bosnian government 
Haris Silaidzic to Moscow on Monday. [no end quotes, as received] 
  He underlined that Russia intends to look for a common 
language with the Moslem leadership. It will try to make its 
utmost so as interests of Bosnia's and Herzegovina's Moslem 
community "were taken into consideration in the course of the 
political settlement."

<F P=106> [From the "Military Courier" program] </F>
  [Text] Russia is starting to play a more active role in 
settling the Balkans crisis, reinforcing its diplomatic efforts 
with a specific peacemaking contribution. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The arrival of Russian 
paratroopers in the Sarajevo area was a key moment in the 
implementation of plans for a political settlement of the crisis 
in Bosnia. As stated by Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, 
chief of the general staff of the Russian Armed Forces, the 
proposed air bombardment of Serbian positions could bring about 
a fresh escalation of the Balkans war. 
  [Begin Kolesnikov recording] I would like particularly to 
emphasize that by threatening to make bomb strikes against 
targets around Sarajevo, the NATO Command put itself, I would 
say, in a fairly ambiguous position. It was publicly stated 
that the use of force was to be the instrument which, it was 
claimed, would make it possible to normalize the situation 
around Sarajevo. In actual fact Western diplomats have admitted 
that bomb strikes would have been been regarded in the North 
Atlantic alliance as a failure. For this reason the NATO bloc 
was relieved to learn the news that, thanks to the efforts of 
Russian diplomacy, success was achieved in convincing the 
Bosnian Serbs that they needed to withdraw their heavy weapons 
from the blockade of Sarajevo. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] Colonel General Yevgeniy Podkolzin, 
commander 
of airborne troops, was directly involved in implementing the 
plan put forward by Russia for settling the Bosnian crisis. 
  [Begin Podkolzin recording] I had two meetings with General 
Rose, commander of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] forces in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, who assured me and gave me a guarantee that 
our troops would be safe. Of course no one at present is 
guaranteeing the lives of our people against the chance sniper's 
bullet, but as for large-scale combat actions, both sides and 
also the Bosnia-Herzegovina command have given an assurance that 
there will not be any such operations. I would like to add that 
we brought in this battalion or independent formation of 400 men 
on condition that NATO would not make any bomb strikes and that 
NATO would verify the fulfilment of the commitments made to NATO 
by both the Serbian and Muslim sides. Among other things, I was 
there in the locality, and on the whole these commitments were 
almost 100 percent carried out. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] At the present time our blue helmets are 
carrying out their peacemaking mission in the so-called buffer 
zone in the Bosnian capital. Along a 16-km front they are 
separating Serbs and Muslims. In addition, Russian 
paratroopers, together with French blue helmets, are now 
guarding Sarajevo Airport. By mid-March there will be 1,500 men 
in the contingent of Russian troops in former Yugoslavia.

efforts by Russia, the United States and the European Union to

  He stressed in an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on 
Saturday [5 March] that the initiatives by Moscow and Washington 
have become "an important step on the road to peace" in the 
region. 
  Attempts to resolve the Bosnian crisis were based on 
theoretical congectures until recently, Stoltenberg stated. The 
peaceful process has switched to the sphere of practical 
solutions. "I'm satisfied that Russia and the United States has 
started to move in the correct direction," he noted.

  [Text] The UN Security Council remains the optimal 
framework for making coordinated decisions concerning the 
settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to a statement by 
the Russian Foreign Ministry published by the INTERFAX news 
agency today. 
  A spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry referred to the 
body's passing a resolution on the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina initiated by Great Britain, Spain, Russia, 
the U.S. and France on March 4 as an example of constructive 
combined efforts by the world community. 
  The resolution envisions a number of measures to maintain 
truce in Sarajevo. According to the document, the city's 
communal services will be repaired under the auspices of the 
United Nations. There will be set up a fund for the 
normalization in Sarajevo. In addition, the United Nations will 
send its special envoy to promote the repair works in the city. 
  The UN Secretary General was asked to submit a report on the 
expediency of extending the "security area" status over the 
Bosnian cities of Maglaj, Mostar and Vitec for consideration by 
the Security Council within 10 days. 
  "The resolution's contents is consistent with the line to 
achieve the ultimate settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina that 
Russia has been pursuing. That is why Russia was among its 
co-authors," the spokesman said. 
  Another statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry published 
today stipulates that the deliveries of humanitarian aid to the 
people of Bosnia-Herzegovina "is improving." "At the moment, 
convoys are shipping aid along all of their routes with 
virtually no obstacles," according to the statement. 
  Two Russian truck units of the Russian State Committee for 
Emergencies take part in the delivery of humanitarian aid. "The 
Russians' contribution is quite significant: a total of 2,659 
tons of aid have been delivered to Bosnia-Herzegovina from 
January 16 to February 28, including 1,940 tons to Tuzla, 206 
tons to Sarajevo, 208 tons to Srebrenica, 111 tons to Gorajde," 
the statement stipulates.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>
  [Text] The United Nations, 5 Mar -- The UN Security Council 
at its meeting on Friday [4 March] adopted Resolution 900 on 
normalizing the situation in Sarajevo. The draft of the 
resolution had been submitted by France and been discussed for 
almost two weeks. In this connection, the ITAR-TASS 
correspondent asked Russia's permanent UN representative Yuliy 
Vorontsov to comment on Russia's involvement in the preparation 
of the document. 
  Russia had a number of provisions included that we wanted to 
see in the resolution, and indeed we reached agreement with its 
co-authors that a number of provisions would be removed from it. 
The resolution needed to be, and ended up roughly being a 
resolution on Sarajevo, and not on all the other problems and 
issues arising in Bosnia-Herzegovina, such as how Sarajevo's 
municipal services should be restored. This indeed was the 
purpose of our amendments and unnecessary things concerning 
general issues in Bosnia-Herzegovina were removed by the authors 
of the draft resolution, Vorontsov stated. 
  Asked about Russia's participation in the peacekeeping 
forces 
in Bosnia, Vorontsov noted that the Russian Parliament's 
decision to send 300 Russian servicemen to Bosnia will be 
officially confirmed shortly. I understand that there has been 
a technical hold-up, on account of which Russia has not been 
included in the list of countries providing troops. Of the 300 
Russian servicemen being sent, 100 will be dispatched to 
Sarajevo and the others will go to Croatia to reinforce our 
battalion. Really speaking, the Russian battalion is not 
stationed in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is stationed in Croatia, 
but it does form part of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]. 
Our battalion is part of UNPROFOR.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin by </F>
correspondent Vitaliy Gan; place and date not given; from the 
"Panorama" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Gan] Far from everyone likes this activity of 
Russia's. For example, the initiatives aimed at easing tension 
around Sarajevo and opening Tuzla airport for humanitarian aid 
caused obvious irritation in NATO circles and among some Western 
leaders. I have turned to Vitaliy Churkin, Russia's deputy 
foreign minister, for comments. 
  [Churkin] It seems to me that irritation is not exactly a 
political category. Indeed, there were some people in the West 
who wanted air strikes and saw them as the main task at the 
time. That was not possible, and therefore such politicians 
probably do not like what Russia did. If one were to speak 
about the official political reaction, it was quite normal. We 
were thanked for making it possible to find the way out of the 
crisis situation around Sarajevo. Moreover, after this, 
everyone recognized without reserve, Russia's role in the 
Bosnian settlement. 
  [Gan] Well, Vitaliy Ivanovich, Americans have said that they 
have strategic interests in former Yugoslavia. Can you say just 
a few words on what sort of interests they might be and whether 
Russia has its interests there, too? 
  [Churkin] I would prefer not to discuss American interests, 
especially strategic interests, and what is more, in Yugoslavia. 
I believe, of course, that such interests exist since the 
United States, like Russia, is a global country and I think that 
it is in the interests of both Russia and the United States that 
a political solution to the problem in such an explosive region 
of the world as the Balkans is found. Speaking about Russia's 
interests, our interest is primarily in this. We are not only a 
world power but also a European country and naturally it is in 
our interests that there is peace in Europe. It is only natural 
that apart from purely political interests we have practical 
economic interests. As soon as the war ends sanctions against 
Yugoslavia will be lifted, and everyone will be able to breathe 
normally in the entire Balkan region. We are already preparing 
for this, and we hope that Russia's economic interests, along 
with the economic interests of other countries, will benefit 
greatly from this. 
  [Gan] One is getting an impression that we are supporting 
different sides in the conflict in Bosnia, I mean we and the 
West. For example, the Bosnian Serbs leader recently visited 
Moscow. Incidentally, they put forward a very important 
initiative with regard to the opening of Tuzla airport for 
humanitarian aid. The Muslim leader was in Washington. Do you 
have anything to say about this? 
  [Churkin] As for Russia, we try to keep in touch with all 
three sides in the conflict. You were right to point out that 
Radovan Karadzic was in Moscow. We are expecting to see Haris 
Silajdzic, prime minister of the Bosnian Government and one of 
the Muslim leaders, in Moscow on Sunday, 6 March. Next week, 
probably on Wednesday, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic 
will also be in Moscow. I must say that the coming week will be 
extremely active from the point of view of our contacts aimed at 
settling the Yugoslav conflict. One could say that the center 
of world activity will move to Moscow, because apart from those 
two visits that I have just mentioned, we are also expecting to 
see in Moscow the Italian foreign minister who will mainly be 
here because of the Yugoslav affairs, while on 12 March the 
Greek foreign minister will come here, to talk about Yugoslavia 
as well. This round of contacts will be concluded on 14 March 
at a meeting in Vladivostok between our Foreign Minister Kozyrev 
and the U.S. state secretary. 
  [Gan] There has been fighting and missile attacks in 
Sarajevo 
in the last few days. What are the peace prospects? 
  [Churkin] The present situation in Sarajevo is better, 
although, as you said, there is sporadic fighting, and there 
have been reports about single missile attacks. But this is not 
at all what it was like, even two weeks ago. The situation in 
the city is much calmer. In general, there are still a lot of 
conflict zones in Bosnia, and many problems. Combat action 
continues in a number of areas of the country. I think that 
some partial measures will not be enough here. A global 
political settlement is needed here. A really great work has 
already been done by everyone toward a settlement. It seems to 
me that we still have to make a last step or two. But as you 
know, the last battle is always the most difficult one, not only 
a military one, but also a political and a diplomatic one. 
Therefore, I would not give any particularly optimistic 
forecasts. Thank you.

  [Text] Belgrade, 6 Mar -- The vanguard group of experts 
from the ministry of emergency situations and other Russian 
departments arrived in Tuzla today. In the Bosnian town under 
Muslim control, it is to pave the way for accommodating a larger 
group of observers called on to monitor consignments arriving at 
the local airport. 
  Russian observers are being sent to Tuzla in line with an 
understanding reached with the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs 
in Moscow recently. Radovan Karadzic, their leader, agreed that 
Tuzla airport should be opened to receive humanitarian 
consignments provided they are monitored by observers from 
Russia. Tuzla airport is in a frontline zone and normally can 
operate only with the agreement of the Serbian side. 
  According to estimates by the UN headquarters, flights may 
begin to Tuzla airport as early as 18 March. Dozens of 
observer-monitors will become operational to inspect and check 
the consignments with a view to banning anything of a military 
nature. Experts from other countries will be here along with 
their Russian colleagues.

  [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has already 
carried out two provisions of its pre-election program -- 
alteration of the Russian foreign policy and release of 
political prisoners, LDP Leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy stressed 
at a meeting with his voters in Sokolniki (Moscow district) on 
Saturday [5 March]. 
  He pointed out the role played by the LDP in the adoption of 
the resolution on amnesty and regretted the continuing 
confrontation between the White and the Red. He proposed that 
this period be completed and everyone be forgiven. "The best 
victory is the one at the elections than on barricades," 
Zhirinovsky believes. 
  Commenting on the alteration of the Russian foreign policy, 
he remarked that the crisis in Sarajevo had been resolved due to 
the LDP position in the State Duma. The LDP had stated that 
"bombardment of Serb positions would mean a war against Russia." 
"Thousands of Serbs were saved from inevitable death thanks to 
me and our party," Zhirinovskiy affirmed. 
  However, the LDP leader continues to insist on resignation 
of 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev saying that Kozyrev 
could not "radically change the foreign policy." 
  Zhirinovskiy demanded once again that the economic sanctions 
against Serbia be lifted. "They can dress and feed us. Russia 
can station there its servicemen withdrawn from Germany. Our 
soldiers and officers will not leave [as received] in camps like 
now," he suggested. 
  Speaking on the enlarged meeting of the government on 
Friday, 
Zhirinovskiy pointed out that Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin had 
shown that he intended to alter the policy and was against 
"those ministers who hampered the move forward." According to 
the LDP leader, there are 4 such ministers in the present 
government -- Vice Premiers Aleksandr Shokhin and Anatoliy 
Chubays, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Minister for 
Nationalities and Regional Policies Sergey Shakhray. 
  Zhirinovskiy also demanded that the military industrial 
complex be completely restored since military production sold 
abroad could ensure "years of good life for Russians." He said 
Philippines had been ready to acquire the MIG-29 military planes 
and officials had concealed the documents and were waiting for 
bribes. 
  About 1000 people were listening to Zhirinovskiy at the 
rally 
near the metro.

<F P=106> [Sergey Tsekhmistrenko report in the "Russian-Estonian </F>
Negotiations" column: "Grudgingly, Tallinn Has Agreed to a 
Dialogue With Moscow"] 
  [Text] Although Tallinn has already announced to the whole 
world its intention to conduct a dialogue with Moscow only with 
international mediation, on the evening of 4 March the Estonian 
Government made a decision not to interrupt direction 
negotiations with Russia on the troops pullout. Motivating its 
position exclusively by "goodwill," Tallinn invited Moscow to 
conduct consultations "at a high political level" (at foreign 
minister level, as Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik 
explained). Having assessed the Estonians' decision as 
"reasonable," Aleksandr Udaltsov, deputy chief of the Second 
European Department at the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry (he 
is in charge of the Baltics), in a conversation with 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent noted that Moscow in fact 
planned to halt the negotiating process. Yet the Estonians are 
to back up their "goodwill" by no less good deeds, and for the 
time being the date for a final withdrawal of Russian troops 
from Estonia remains open. 
  Moscow's position is based on three fundamental principles: 
the provision of social guarantees to the Russian military 
pensioners living in Estonia (10,500 people), the dropping of 
claims for compensation for "ecological damage from the troop 
presence" in exchange for the real estate left over by them 
("zero option"), and the granting by the Estonians of $23 
million to build housing for the withdrawing troops. According 
to Mr. Udaltsov, last November the Estonians themselves proposed 
the above sum together with the "zero option," at the same time 
offering concessions on the issue of military pensioners. Given 
this, Moscow promised at the time to move the pullout date to 
August 1994. Yet signs are that the Estonians' promises were 
just a tactical ploy aimed apparently at the Western public, 
which is sensitive to Baltic issues. 
  In December, it became clear that the pensioners agreement 
can hardly be reached: Estonia adopted a law whereby being 
"potential enemies of the Estonian people and statehood," they 
cannot count on getting citizenship in the republic or any other 
political and property rights. Soon Tallinn's position on the 
payment of the $23 million also changed. The Estonians stated 
that Moscow simply misunderstood them: apparently they meant... 
"the Vancouver package," more specifically the $160 million 
allocated by the United States within its framework to provide 
for the retirees. True, in a hurry to share these outside 
funds, Estonia failed to notice that those monies were not meant 
for active duty officers. 
  According to Mr. Udaltsov, in spite of Russia's interest in 
getting the troops out of Estonia as soon as possible ("there is 
no point in their further presence there"), it cannot be 
entirely ruled out that the last Russian soldier may not leave 
the republic by 31 August. Moscow will not allow a repetition 
of the "Lithuanian precedent" and will not withdraw the troops 
until corresponding agreements have been reached. Mr. Udaltsov 
is sure that the Estonians will not succeed in appealing to the 
United Nations or the CSCE because their resolutions say that 
the pullout of troops should proceed on the basis of such 
agreements. One is only left to hope that Mr. Udaltsov's 
certainty will meet with understanding in international 
organizations and that they will not violate their own decisions.

  [Text] Russia is seeking political ways of persuading 
Latvia and Estonia to review their position on the status of 
Russian-speaking communities there but there are no strings 
attached to troop withdrawals from those countries, Vice Foreign 
Minister Vitaliy Churkin said in Moscow on Sunday [6 March]. 
  In a speech to the Yeltsin-sponsored public chamber 
discussing the plight of Russian-speaking communities in Baltic 
states, Churkin said that in international law, Russia was 
perfectly right to link any economic cooperation with those 
countries to the treatment of Russian residents there. 
  "Of course, economic blockades or sanctions is not the best 
of options, but it will be unrealistic to expect that Russia 
will meet those countries half-way in the face of their 
deliberate policy of discrimination against our compatriots", he 
said. 
  Churkin said that any show of respect for members of the 
Russian-speaking communities there would be met with 
"understanding and response" in Russia. 
  In his words, Moscow works on the assumption that ensuring 
human rights regardless of citizenship is a key element of 
internationally-recognized standards. He pointed to LIthuania's 
human rights record as an example. 
  Speaking in an interview with Interfax, Churkin stressed the 
need to speed up the formation of a special government body 
responsible for solving the problem of Russian communities in 
former Soviet republics. He said the need for such a structure 
was caused by the dimension of the problem itself and necessity 
to rally effort by various departments. Churkin believes such a 
body can operate under the wing of the foreign ministry though 
as an independent organization.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 6 Mar -- Deputy Russian Foreign Minister 
Vitaliy Churkin has stated that the Russian Foreign Ministry 
considers the protection of the rights and interests of ethnic 
Russians in the Baltic states as a priority task in its work in 
the Baltics. He said this today at a meeting of the Public 
Chamber under the Russian president, which is examining the 
position of the Russian-speaking population in the Baltic 
countries -- to be precise, in Latvia and Estonia -- since, 
according to the participants of the discussion, "normal 
conditions have been created in Lithuania for ethnic Russians." 
  Having pointed out that "the infringement of the rights of 
the Russians and Russian-speaking population in Latvia and 
Estonia is giving cause for great concern," Vitaliy Churkin 
underlined that the discussion of this issue by the Public 
Chamber proves that this problem has "really a political 
connotation." At the same time, according to him, "this is not 
paying tribute to the present state of affairs. Our treatment 
of this issue is being dictated by the concern for Russians who 
have found themselves beyond the borders of their fatherland." 
  The problem is extremely complex and the Foreign Affairs 
Ministry is striving to show maximum flexibility in solving it, 
the deputy minister said in an interview with an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent. "You can understand the anxiety of Latvians who 
think that having 40 percent Russians in their republic is a 
lot," Vitaliy Churkin said. "But the problem needs to be and can 
be solved in the framework of cooperation, taking into account, 
if nothing else, the fact that it was the Russian Federation 
that helped Latvia attain independence, and not at the price of 
forcing out Russian-speakers from territory on which they have 
been living for many years, many of them even having been born 
there." In the opinion of Vitaliy Churkin, the time has come to 
equate Russophobia with such phenomena as aggressive 
nationalism, chauvinism, and antisemitism. 
  Vitaliy Churkin said that Russia's Foreign Ministry was 
implementing three main policies in its work: the maintenance of 
direct communications with Russians in Latvia, Lithuania, and 
Estonia to be of practical assistance to them in adapting to new 
conditions of life; a bilateral dialogue with the Baltic states; 
and the use of international organizations and contacts with 
leading countries of the West to draw attention to this problem. 
He noted, among other things, that the Foreign Ministry of the 
Russian Federation was constantly drawing the attention of the 
CSCE and the Council of Europe to the situation of 
Russian-speakers in the Baltic countries. A Russian delegation 
at the permanent committee of the CSCE has regularly been 
initiating debate on this matter, urging it to take specific 
steps in this area. 
  After stressing that Russia "does not intend to distance 
itself from the resolution of the problem," the deputy minister 
said that the Foreign Ministry had detailed a program for the 
defense of the rights and interests of ethnic Russians in the 
countries of the CIS and Russia, which laid out a range of 
measures needed to be implemented to assist where necessary 
compatriots who had found themselves in a difficult situation 
abroad.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 6 TASS -- After heated debates over the 
situation of ethnic Russians in the Baltic republics, the Public 
Chamber under the Russian president approved "in principle" on 
Sunday [6 March] three documents: recommendations for the 
Russian president, appeals to the Federation Council and the 
State Duma, and an address to Russian citizens. 
  It was decided that after being finalized by a drafting 
committee and an initiative group, the documents would be 
forwarded by a co-chairmen to the adressees. 
  Public chamber co-chairman Boris Topornin said at the close 
of the meeting that issues submitted for the chamber's 
consideration should be worked out more carefully. 
  After hearing officials of the Russian Foreign Ministry and 
other relevant agencies, including the Migration Service, the 
Ministry for Cooperation, the Russian ambassadors to Latvia and 
Estonia, members of the Public Chamber agreed that "numerous 
violations of the rights of compatriots take place" in the 
Baltic republics of Latvia and Estonia. 
  Not only people who settled in the Baltics after 1940, but 
also many of native residents have been stripped of citizenship 
there. Hundreds of thousands of non-citizens do not have the 
right to own land and real estate, they are even forbidden to 
change their flats. They are barred from public service, they 
are also socially deprived. Life is especially difficult for 
former servicemen and members of their families. All this can 
be considered as "a deliberate discriminatory policy of ousting 
ethnic Russians." 
  Reporting some cases of discimination of Latvia's ethnic 
Russians and Russian-speaking "non-citizens," President of the 
Sodruzhestvo Foundation Mikhail Zadornov, who was among of the 
initiators of the discussion in the public chamber, pointed out 
that Russia did not provide actual assistance to ethnic Russians 
outside it and to forced migrants coming to the country. 
  This view was shared by many politicians and public figures. 
They believe the president should "come up with a statement on 
the concept of Russia's state policy with respect to 
compatriots." This motion was included into a draft 
recommendation by the public chamber for President Boris Yeltsin. 
  The Foreign Ministry was recommended to regard protection of 
the interests of ethnic Russians living in the Baltic states as 
a priority task and to step up its activities in international 
organizations with an aim to spotlight violations of human 
rights in the Baltic countries. The Russian Government was 
recommended to speed the drafting and passage of a federal 
programme for protection and support of ethnic Russians residing 
in former Soviet republics. The public chamber called upon the 
Federation Council and the State Duma to ratify within the 
shortest posssible time the agreements and accords signed with 
Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. These agreements are designed to 
ensure legal protection of ethnic Russians. 
  Participants in the discussion emphasised that ethnic 
Russians in other ex-Soviet republics had found themselves in 
rather desperate conditions as well. Each of the 
newly-independent states "has its own specific problems related 
to the Russian-speaking population, but the need for actions to 
protect compatriots living there are extremely acute in all of 
them," the Public Chamber stressed.

  [Text] Moscow, 6 Mar -- Documents covering an investigation 
by the Riga garrison military procurator's office, which have 
been sent to the Russian chief military procurator's office, 
confirm the information provided on 25 February by ITAR-TASS 
correspondent Roman Zadunayskiy that soldiers belonging to the 
North Western Group of Forces [NWGF] had that day been admitted 
with wounds to Riga military hospital. 
  According to E. Kuzmin, the military procurator's office 
junior sergeant and Privates S. Fedorov, A. Dumilin and A. 
Ivanov, soldiers belonging to the 651st Independent Company for 
escorting NWGF freight and stationed at military unit No. 52241 
in Riga, were on the night of 25 February admitted to the 289th 
district military hospital in Riga with various wounds. 
(?Contact Service) Private Sergey Glinka of Military Unit No. 
52241 diagnosed as suffering from a knife wound had already been 
admitted to the same hospital on the previous evening. All five 
stated on their admission to hospital that they had received 
their injuries and wounds when they were attacked by unknown 
civilians. All this investigation information was reported on 
the night of 25 February to the Russian chief military 
procurator's office by the Riga garrison military procurator's 
office duty officer. 
  These facts need to be set out in such detail, since on 2 
March the NWGF press center issued information that no 
servicemen suffering from injuries and wounds inflicted by 
unknown assailants had recently been admitted to Riga military 
hospital. 
  The military procurator's office is continuing to 
investigate 
the facts.

  [Text] Introduction of foreign observers to the occupied 
Palestinian territories could decrease the tension emerged after 
the tragedy in Hebron, the Russian foreign minister suggested 
during the meeting with Moroccan Foreign Minister Abdellatif 
Filali in Moscow on Saturday [5 March]. 
  According to Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, it is 
important to discuss the peaceful process from a new angle and 
to speed it up. This was the purpose of the second plenary 
meeting of the Madrid Peace Conference on the Middle East 
initiated by a Russian co-sponsor. 
  The Moroccan foreign minister highly appraised the active 
mediation of Russia. He spoke for enhancing interaction between 
Russian and the Arab states, including Morocco, in order to 
achieve complete and fair peaceful settlement in the Middle East. 
  The Moroccan minister transferred a message from Moroccan 
King Hassan II addressed to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  Several issues concerning the bilateral relations were also 
discussed on the initiative of the Russian party. The parties 
spoke for enlargement of cooperation and for organization of the 
appropriate negotiations in Morocco in the near future. 
Chairman of the Russian Committee on Fishing, Vladimir 
Korelskiy took part in the conversation. 
  Settlement of the issue concerning Western Sahara within the 
scope of the UN peaceful plan was considered among other issues. 
The two foreign ministers supported the initiatives of the UN 
secretary general and his envoys on the referendum which was to 
be held in Western Sahara under international control.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov 
has returned from his trip connected with the Middle East 
settlement. Ivanov handed Yasir 'Arafat a personal message from 
the Russian president expressing Russia's firm intention to 
contribute to the achievement of all-encompassing peace and 
security in the Middle East. Here is correspondent Aleksandr 
Peslyak with the details: 
  [Peslyak] After the Hebron tragedy, the situation in the 
Middle East has sharply deteriorated. In order to prevent an 
escalation of violence and promote a resumption of the 
negotiating process, on the instructions of the Russian 
president our diplomat has spent three days shuttling between 
Tel Aviv and Tunis holding talks with 'Arafat, Rabin, and Peres. 
  [Begin Ivanov recording] We discussed in particular the need 
to adopt an urgent UN Security Council resolution, which would 
condemn the crime committed and which would also be aimed at 
promoting a resumption of the negotiating process. [end 
recording] 
  [Peslyak] Also, Ivanov believes, it is important to ensure 
an 
international presence in the region, and an active role on the 
part of the cosponsors of the process, the United States and 
Russia. Apart from anything else, it is precisely the impetus 
from outside that will help the Palestinians and Israelis to sit 
down again at the negotiating table, because the shock from a 
breakdown in the document, which was 90 percent agreed, which 
could have been implemented in mid-April, is too great, and 
there are no direct contacts between the sides. But joint 
actions by Washington and Moscow do not preclude independent 
efforts by each one of them. Tomorrow, Ivanov is having a 
meeting with envoys from Israel and the Arab countries, and 
today he had a conversation with the U.S. ambassador.

  [Text] Moscow March 4 TASS -- Russia and Germany have 
started the second stage of the creation of a system for 
monitoring of radiation-danger facilities. 
  Sensors will be located at the Kursk and either Novovoronezh 
or Leningrad nuclear power plants. The final choice of the 
plant will be done at a meeting of Russian and German 
environmental ministers on March 9-10 in Leipzig. 
  The monitoring system is expected to be used at all nuclear 
power plants of Russia's European part by 1995 under an 
agreement reached at a meeting of Russian experts that closed 
here today. It provides for location of sensors measuring the 
radiation level on the area around radiation-danger facilities 
(30 kilometers for nuclear power plants). The sensor 
information will be passed over to Moscow's Federal Center of 
Radiology Control via satellite. 
  The first stage of the system has been completed at the 
Smolensk nuclear power plant. Its information has been 
available since December 1993. 
  The Russian-German cooperation is done within the framework 
of an agreement on collection, transfer, analysis and estimation 
of radiology information. The document provides for German 
equipment of the federal center, supplies of standard software 
and development of applied software. The Russian side is in 
charge of basic assets, location of sensors and satellite 
communications. 
  The agreement also includes bilateral exchange of 
information 
once a day under regular conditions and every ten minutes in 
case of the radiation level increase.

  [Text] Seoul March 7 TASS -- The South Korean Foreign 
Ministry told ITAR-TASS there was no truth in recent Seoul press 
reports that many North Korean woodcutters working in Russia 
have been applying for political asylum in South Korea. The 
South Korean Ministry said cases of defection could be counted 
on the fingers of one hand. 
  A competent source in the South Korean Foreign Ministry said 
about seventy North Koreans were seeking to settle in Russia for 
fear their flight to South Korea could spell out disaster for 
their families and relatives in North Korea. 
  The same source said that under the South Korean 
Constitution 
all inhabitants of the Korean peninsula are regarded as citizens 
of the Republic of Korea. In this connection the Government of 
the Republic of Korea shows interest in the fate of northern 
compatriots. Seoul expects Russia to regard the North Korean 
workers who fled from the North Korean labour camps as refugees 
and, respecting their rights as such, not to deport them to 
North Korea. 
  Seoul is now considering ways of bringing its internal 
regulations and provisions for Korean immigrants and defectors 
in line with international standards, the source said without 
specifying what changes will be made. 
  The Seoul press alleged last month that between 100 and 150 
North Korean workers escaped from Siberian woodcutting spells 
and asked for political asylum in South Korean diplomatic 
offices in Russia. North Korea rejected the allegations. 
  This year three North Koreans were reported have reached 
South Korea from Siberia and obtained residence permits here. 
They had not approached either the embassy nor the South Korean 
consular offices in Russia.

  [Text] Moscow, March 7 (CNA) -- Recent Russian media 
reports which claim that the Yeltsin administration secretly 
gave away some two thousand islands to the People's Republic of 
China have fueled discontent in Russia's border regions. 
  Sparking the dispute was a report which originated in Japan 
that after 24 years of negotiations, Russia and Mainland China 
have agreed that the big Ussuri Island belongs to China. 
  The large island is only a few hundred meters off the coast 
of the Russian city Khabarovsk, and if it is turned over to the 
PRC, the two nations would only be separated by a small strip of 
water. 
  The report has raised the ire of local residents, who 
reportedly are willing to fight to remain under Russian rule. 
  "If the big Ussuri Island is transferred to the jurisdiction 
of the People's Republic of China, the whole city will take up 
pitchforks and go out and fight, and I shall be in the 
frontline," Mr. Viktor Ishayev, the head of the Khabarovsk 
regional administration, was quoted as saying by SEGODNYA, the 
Moscow daily. 
  However, reports about the transfer have been denied by 
Russian officials. 
  Yuriy Arkharov, deputy head of the joint Russian-Chinese 
Commission on Border Demarcation, resolutely refuted the 
allegations of a secret "sell-out." Other officials have also 
denied any of the reported 2,000 island were turned over to the 
Chinese Communists. 
  Cross-border traffic and disputes have increased since 
recent 
relaxations in border controls, SEGODNYA reported. The 
relaxation of controls has cleared the way for "barbaric fishing 
practices by Chinese fishermen," and increased Chinese ship 
traffic, has "exacerbated the poor ecological conditions in the 
city," the daily said. 
  Regardless of the growing discontent, the official Russian 
stance is that since no mutually acceptable decision is in view, 
both sides will put the issue aside for the time being and 
continue to uphold the status quo.

  [Text] Moscow March 5 TASS -- Chairman of the Joint Chief 
of Staff Committee of Indian Armed Forces General Bipin Chandra 
Joshi today highly appreciated the results of his visit to 
Russia. The esteemed Indian guest is flying home on Sunday [6 
March] morning. 
  India maintains deep interest in military and technical 
cooperation with Russia, General Joshi emphasised talking to 
ITAR-TASS. Our army is equipped with 70 per cent of arms made 
in Soviet union, and lately we are experiencing problems in its 
modernization and ensuring supplies of spare parts, the general 
noted. 
  The Indian military commander said that Russia has 
commitments in the sphere of defence from the former Soviet 
Union, including supplies of military equipment and spare parts 
for it. He also spoke of India's interest in acquiring the most 
up-to date weapons. 
  Commander-in-chief of the Russian Army Colonel-General 
Vladimir Semyonov, who also took part in the talk, said that the 
Russian side will help the Indian Army equip T-72 tanks with new 
engines and arms and also modernize other military ware. 
According to the Russian commander-in-chief, the Indian side 
has displayed interest in helicopters, hovercraft and 
particularly in control and reconnaissance systems. Certain 
kinds of arms India will, possibly, take on lease for 2-3 years 
for an appropriate fee, he said.

in accordance with Article 104 of the Russian Constitution. 
  In the first half of the year, I will introduce draft laws 
regulating the procedure for setting up and organizing the

the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court of the Russian 
Federation, on the procuracy in the Russian Federation, on the 
Government of the Russian Federation, on federal bodies of the 
executive power, on the federal state apparatus and others). In 
addition to this, in the first half of 1994, I will also prepare 
draft laws on general principles of state administration in 
Russia's constituent parts, as well as on general principles of 
local government. At the same time, I am planning to submit to 
the State Duma draft laws on the Civil, Criminal, and Land 
Codes, as well as some economic laws. 
  During the second half of 1994, I am planning to submit 
draft 
laws aimed at ensuring citizens' economic and political rights 
(on forced migrants and refugees from areas of interethnic 
conflicts, on ethnic minorities, on protection of rights of the 
unemployed, on public events, on political parties, on the 
elections of the president of the Russian Federation and of the 
State Duma deputies, on the procedure for setting up the 
Federation Council of the Federal Assembly, on public 
associations and others). 
  The attached list is not a final one, and some draft laws 
presently being worked on may be added to it.

the republic's government as unsatisfactory. The government, 
dismissed by decree of President Ruslan Aushev as of March 6, 
will remain in office until parliament takes a final decision. 
  The Congress passed a resolution which says recent 
re-election of Aushev as president of Ingushetia showed that the 
people approved of his internal and foreign policy. Aushev 
himself, in a message to the congress, described the 
presidential and parliamentary elections and referendum on the 
republic's constitution, all held on February 27, as an historic 
step towards Ingushetia's revival as a state.

  [Text] President Yeltsin's decree issued earlier this week 
provides guarantees for complete rehabilitation of the Balkarian 
people [Kabardino-Balkar Republic], Balkarian social security 
minister Boris Zamakulov said. 
  Under the decree, each victim is entitled to a lump sum in 
compensation money equivalent to 100 minimal wages in the first 
stage. The federal government is expected to raise Rbl [rubles] 
27 Bn to this end. 
  "Generally speaking, no indemnity can compensate the losses 
sustained by the Balkarian people. The question is one of 
partial compensation as an indication of full rehabilitation of 
the people falling victim to purges", Zamakulov said. In his 
words, any delay of the process will cause a negative response 
on the ground. 
  Zamakulov also insists that one-time benefits be paid not 
only to the victims themselves, but also to their family members 
including their children born in places of resettlement.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sharip Asuyev] </F>
  [Text] Groznyy March 6 TASS -- Yaragiy Mamodayev, a Chechen 
opposition leader and head of the dissolved "government of 
popular trust," views reports on alleged plans for toppling the 
regime of current President Dzhokhar Dudayev as acts of 
provocations aiming to finally crush Chechnya's constructive 
opposition. 
  He told TASS over the phone on Sunday these rumours were 
heavily aggravating the already tense situation in the North 
Caucasian republic, while petty political intrigues by various 
groups and groupings claiming to be Chechen opposition hampered 
the movement towards achieving national accord in society. 
  41-year-old Mamodayev is one of Dudayev's major political 
opponents, who was accused by the Chechen prosecutor's office of 
"high treason and attempted violent overthrow of the existing 
regime." 
  But Mamodayev flatly rejects use of force in settling 
political issues. "To avoid self-extermination of the Chechen 
people, all its representatives, both those in power and those 
in opposition, should immediately agree to the only possible way 
of saving the republic: To step down simultaneously and call new 
democratic elections," the opposition leader proposed. The 
accord thus achieved might lay the foundation for building 
Chechnya's relations with Russia, he believes.

  [Text] President Dzhokhar Dudayev of the breakaway Russian 
republic of Chechnya said he doubted that ex-speaker of the 
former Russian parliament Ruslan Khasbulatov would join the 
opposition in Chechnya, where has come to live after being 
amnestied by new parliament. 
  "Ruslan Khasbulatov is a figure who has some real weight in 
the Russian political scene, and it is hardly possible that he 
will join any of the criminal elements," Dudayev told Interfax. 
  The president said there was today no opposition in 
Chechnya. 
There are only "ordinary groups of bandits, who seek to take 
control of the situation under the pretense of carrying on a 
political struggle," he said. The republic's State Department 
has listed 30 opposition leaders to be arrested. 
  Dudayev said his government knew nothing about any attempts 
of the opposition to draw Khasbulatov, who is at present living 
with his mother in the village of Tolstoy-Yurt, into their ranks. 
  Asked about the possibility of cooperation between 
Chechnya's 
leadership and Khasbulatov, who was arrested last October as one 
of the organizers of the hardline revolt in Moscow, the 
president said: "We are not in a position to say anything about 
that, because it is Khasbulatov's private matter."

<F P=106> [Natalya Gorodetskaya, Vladimir Todres report in the "North </F>
Caucasus" column: "Chechnya Welcomes Its Hero"] 
  [Excerpt] On 11 March the State Duma will discuss the 
situation in Chechnya. Sergey Shakhray is expected to make a 
report. His position is well known: Chechnya can be de facto 
brought back into the Russian Federation by concluding a treaty 
with it based on the Russian-Tatarstan agreement. An obligatory 
condition for the start of negotiations, however, must be free 
elections in Chechnya -- with the participation of the 
anti-Dudayev opposition. 
  At present, according to the minister, "not a single 
political force controls the situation in the republic" and 
therefore there is simply no one to come to terms with. Yet 
even if elections are held, this will hardly make things easier 
for Russia: according to local observers, none of the local 
politicians can match Dzhokhar Dudayev's authority. No one -- 
except Ruslan Khasbulatov, who has returned to his mother's home. 
  In spite of the fact that on 15 September 1991 Ruslan 
Khasbulatov, who was then chairman of the Russian Supreme 
Soviet, blessed Dzhokhar Dudayev to lead the Chechen Republic, 
now the ungrateful Chechen leader is in no hurry to meet him. 
As Chechnya Vice President Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev told INTERFAX, 
no official meetings have been planned with the former speaker 
of the Russian parliament, but if Mr. Khasbulatov insists, such 
meetings could be arranged. Furthermore the vice president was 
rather skeptical over the prospect of Ruslan Khasbulatov's 
working in Chechnya as an economist: "He has never dealt with 
economics. It is another matter that he has studied the 
political economy of the West, but these are quite different 
things." In his opinion, the former Russian Federation Supreme 
Soviet speaker will not engage in politics, let alone join the 
Chechen opposition. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev suggested that 
confrontation and instability will increase in Russia after the 
State Duma's resolution on amnesty. He said in an interview 
with Interfax on Saturday that the president's chair will be 
under siege. According to Dudayev, it will be difficult for the 
Russian president to keep his post in the context of such a 
situation. 
  "The scenario also provides for temporary neutralization of 
Viktor Chernomyrdin with his further discrediting and pushing 
out of the political life," the Chechen president added. He 
said this proved that the government led by Chernomyrdin had 
been subjected to unfair criticism from the very first days of 
its work. According to Dudayev, only this government could 
withdraw the Russian economy from the crisis. 
  He said the position of former Prosecutor General Aleksey 
Kazannik was that of a very honest courageous man who realized 
that all perspectives would be in vain if once to compromise and 
to sacrifice the lawfulness.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 2032 GMT on 3 March broadcasts a 
10-minute program entitled "Russia and Uzbekistan: A Path Toward 
Trust." The program contains an interview with Uzbekistan's 
President Islam Karimov by Ostankino Television correspondent 
Farid Seyful-Mulyukov. The interview was recorded after 
President Karimov had concluded his official visit to Moscow and 
is on the results of his visit, his talks with President 
Yeltsin, and the general situation in the CIS. 
  President Karimov begins by saying: "I am satisfied with the 
results of the talks and conversations we had with President 
Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Stepanovich 
Chernomyrdin, members of the government, statesmen, and public 
representatives." He continues: "I would like to draw the main 
conclusion on the results of my visit: Relations between Russia 
and Uzbekistan are entering an entirely new stage and are 
reaching an entirely new level. I would like to stress again 
that in some way it is a prototype of the relations Russia 
intends to have with the countries within the CIS and, thus, to 
give an entirely new impetus to the content of the Commonwealth 
in general. "In this regard, the interests of both Russia 
and Uzbekistan coincide. We do not imagine our future without 
Russia. I state this authoritatively. I am convinced that 
Russia's interests in Central and Middle Asia and Uzbekistan 
coincide with the policy we pursue, and I am convinced that 
Russia is interested in having Uzbekistan as its reliable 
long-term partner and ally in the Central Asian region." 
  Karimov says that Russia is a great superpower, and as such, 
Russia has interests beyond its territory. In his opinion, 
Russia -- like any other superpower -- should protect its 
interests and state them loud and clear. He stresses that here 
"the main point is that there should be no imperial ambitions on 
the part of Russia, and that Russia's interests should coincide 
with the interests of the countries and states, which have 
become sovereign and independent today." 
  He continues: "Then the foundation is laid for normal, 
equal, 
and mutually advantageous long-term reliable relations between 
these states." Karimov reiterates that Uzbekistan is interested 
in having such a reliable partner as Russia, and stresses that 
Russia should be a guarantor of stability and peace in the 
Central Asian region. 
  To a question about the exacerbated situation on the 
Tajik-Afghan border and measures to stabilize it, Karimov says: 
"The border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan is not merely a 
border between these two states, it is the CIS border; it is the 
border of Russia, Uzbekistan, and all other states in this 
region," and everyone is interested in peace and stability in 
Tajikistan. "There are no effectual borders between Tajikistan 
and Uzbekistan, and everything taking place in Tajikistan today 
will affect Uzbekistan tomorrow without fail," President Karimov 
stresses. He adds that the states that are parties to the 
treaty on collective security have clearly stated that their 
interests in the border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan are 
unshakeable, "and we will do everything possible to protect 
these borders as our own." 
  Touching on the issue of reforms, Karimov explains that the 
purpose of reforms in Uzbekistan coincides with the purpose of 
reforms in Russia. Uzbekistan is in favour of a market economy. 
He stresses that both Russia and Uzbekistan are countries of 
the east and have specific features which have to be taken into 
account. These features are connected to their historic past, 
national peculiarities, and to the mentality of the people. He 
warns that "Russia is no Poland, or any republic where any 
experiments can be performed," and stresses that people should 
come first, because reforms are not implemented for reforms' 
sake, but for the sake of the people. 
  On the prospects for the Commonwealth, Karimov says that 
political independence and sovereignty are not economic notions. 
In his opinion, political independence should be based on 
economic categories. "Our first principle is the priority of 
the economy over politics and a complete removal of ideology 
from the economy. Having built the economic basis of our 
society, we can speak about sovereignty and independence," 
Karimov states. He says that the Commonwealth is what was 
needed after the disintegration of the Union. "If there had not 
been a Commonwealth, we would have probably had a scenario 
similar to the Yugoslav one on the territory of the former 
Union. I have grounds for saying this. In this respect, during 
this time the Commonwealth has undergone certain changes and 
transformations. Today all the member states of the 
Commonwealth realize that our future lies in a closer knit 
Commonwealth, and we should give this Commonwealth specific 
forms and a specific face. The Commonwealth should work toward 
common goals as well as toward the interests of every state that 
joins this Commonwealth." Karimov says that today the 
Commonwealth has new goals and that everyone is convinced that 
"we should see our future in strengthening the Commonwealth. 
Russia is interested in us, and, of course, we see that our 
future lies together with Russia. What we signed today and 
yesterday is evidently the prototype of what Russia will have 
with all the CIS states, and this will ensure that our relations 
with Russia are equal, mutually advantageous, long-term, and 
most reliable in terms of partnership," President Karimov 
concludes.

  [Text] Riga, 23 Feb -- The board of the Democratic Party 
has adopted a statement asking the state's president and the 
Saeima [parliament] to reject the agreement which foresees the 
Skrunda radar station maintaining the status of a Russian 
military base. The Democratic Party is of the opinion that the 
agreement with Russia should foresee the dismantling of the 
Skrunda radar station and its removal from Latvian territory. 
  The statement also says that it could be acceptable to 
permit 
coordination of the schedule for dismantling and removing the 
Skrunda radar station with plans to build a new station, which 
is being supervised by international observers. This would then 
be a guarantee for the fulfillment of the terms of the agreement.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 4 [date as received] -- According to IBERIA 
news agency opposition parties adopted a statement that says: 
"To the United Nations Organization, the peoples and 
governments of the world! 
  At its 1 March 1994 session, the Georgian Supreme Council 
ratified a document on Georgia joining the CIS, signed by Eduard 
Shevardnadze, the Supreme Council chairman and head of state, by 
126 votes to 69 (two abstained), thus making an attempt to 
legalize the loss of independence by Georgia and Georgia's 
incorporation into a modernized empire. 
  This act passed by the Supreme Council contradicts the law, 
and Georgia's union with Russia and other republics of the 
former Soviet Union is illegal because of the following 
conditions: 
  1. The act of the restoration of Georgian state 
independence, 
passed unanimously by the legally elected Supreme Council 
(parliament) of the Republic of Georgia on 9 April 1991, is 
based on the results of a referendum held in the Republic of 
Georgia on 31 March 1991, during which 99 percent of the 
participants voted for the independence of Georgia and in which 
90 percent of electors took part. It is illegal to pass any 
resolution on a complete or partial abolition (limitation) of 
Georgia's independence other than by means of a referendum. 
  2. Over half of MPs on the list, yet less than two thirds 
(there are 222 members in the Georgian Supreme Council), voted 
for the approval of the 1 March 1994 resolution of the Georgian 
Supreme Council. Meanwhile, the above-mentioned resolution a) 
differs from a confirmation of a bilateral or multilateral 
treaty in its concept pertaining the statute of the Republic of 
Georgia as a state and, b) requires an amendment in the Republic 
of Georgia's law "On the state authority" that was voted for and 
passed by the qualified majority of the Georgian Supreme Council 
as a law of constitutional importance. Paragraphs Four, Nine, 
and others of the CIS regulations stipulate that a number of 
discrete rights of the Supreme Council listed in Paragraph Seven 
of the Republic of Georgia's law "On the state rule" are 
transferred to the competence of the CIS. Therefore, only a 
qualified majority can pass the resolution. 
  3. According to the Republic of Georgia's laws "On the state 
rule" and "On the statute of a deputy," certain executive 
occupations cannot be combined with the statute of a deputy (a 
list of those has been approved). There are 15 members of this 
kind in the Georgian Supreme Council at present. All of them 
consented to Georgia joining the CIS and this was known to other 
MPs before the vote and was proved by the vote. Despite the 
requirements of the regulations, these Supreme Council members 
participated in the voting. 
  4. A law "On conclusion, ratification, implementation, and 
denunciation of international treaties" was violated. According 
to Paragraph 11 of the law, the Georgian Supreme Council Foreign 
Affairs Commission carries out the preliminary discussion of an 
international treaty submitted for ratification and issues an 
appropriate conclusion. 
  5. Georgia's joining the CIS contradicts the Republic of 
Georgia's law "On defense," which recognizes Georgia's active 
neutrality and nonalliance to any military bloc. 
  Apart from direct contradictions to the aforementioned law, 
the contents of the resolution passed by the Supreme Council, 
and the procedure taken have other political and procedural 
shortcomings. Namely: 
  a) The election program of neither Eduard Shevardnadze, the 
Supreme Council chairman, nor any other member of the Supreme 
Council mentioned the prospect of Georgia joining the CIS. On 
the contrary, the election programs of all of them contained 
promises to defend and strengthen Georgia's independence. Thus, 
the 1 March 1994 Supreme Council resolution was not authorized 
by electors. 
  b) Apart from the regulations, a Georgian translation 
(therefore nonauthentic) of which was distributed among members 
of the Supreme Council before the session, regulations on 
passing resolutions, as well the as rights and duties of the 
member countries of the CIS are defined by a number of other 
documents that were not available for the MPs. 
  c) The discussion and voting in the Georgian Supreme Council 
on 1 March 1994 was preceded by a year-and-a-half-long process 
of Georgia's economic destruction and variable destabilization 
which, in our opinion, was artificial to a large extent and in 
which, in our opinion, communist and pro-communist high echelons 
of Georgia's executive authorities participated in order to 
provoke Georgia's joining a modernized Russian empire. 
  Because Paragraphs two and Three of the above were read to 
the chairman and the speaker of the Supreme Council, a demand 
was made that the parliamentary authority of the above-mentioned 
15 MPs [combining executive positions with Supreme Council 
membership] should be stopped and that voting should be ruled by 
two-thirds of the Supreme Council, and because these demands 
were rejected against the law and regulations by the 
parliamentary majority, we consider that this is a coup d'etat 
from above. 
  During the session the police battered representatives of 
the 
National Liberation Movement who stood silent holding posters on 
the sidewalk in front of the Supreme Council building. The 
police also dispersed refugees from Abkhazia who stood beside 
them. During the session, Jaba Ioseliani, the former chairman 
of the "Emergency Committee," said from the rostrum that the 
opposition had to be jailed. For two months prior to the 
session a series of terrorist acts causing casualties were 
carried out in Georgia. Thus, the Supreme Council session, 
which made a decision on Georgia's joining the CIS was held in a 
state of terror. 
  During the discussion of the resolution, the debates were 
stopped by a decision of the parliamentary majority, and not 
only were MPs who were on the list of speakers refused a right 
to speak, but even factions." 
  The statement was signed by 69 deputies, who did not vote 
for 
Georgia becoming a member of the CIS.

Gambacorta, in Moscow; Khasbulatov in Russian with superimposed

  [Text] [Gambacorta] Are you happy with the amnesty? 
  [Khasbulatov] Of course, it is not a pleasant experience to 
be in prison. However, they would have released me soon in any 
case, partly because of my health, but above all because the 
judges could not find a shred of evidence against me. 
  [Gambacorta] President Yeltsin maintains ... 
  [Khasbulatov, interrupting] But which president? He was 
elected president under the old Constitution, which he himself 
regards as being undemocratic and to be annulled. However, this 
Constitution is still better than the one which he had passed in 
December without allowing the people to discuss it. I do not 
believe that the 20th century has yet seen a worse constitution. 
  [Gambacorta] Boris Yeltsin maintains that he is in total 
control of the situation. What do you think about this? 
  [Khasbulatov] I only say that in his message to the chambers 
Boris Nikolayevich accepted 99 percent of the proposals which we 
made three years ago. He accepted our diplomacy and gave in to 
the extent that he reduced us to a satellite state. Suddenly we 
find ourselves once again a great power. In Russia, if 
Yeltsin's supporters want to, they can start a new civil war, 
like the one in October which had a death toll of 1,500 and not 
the 150 which the government maintains. Must we perhaps forget 
everything? This is fascism, and the people have realized this.

  [Text] Former Russian Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy said 
he did not intend to seek power by all means as it was alleged. 
"After the 5 months in the Lefortovo prison I realized the 
tragedy which had happened," he stressed in a telephone 
conversation with an Interfax correspondent. 
  Rutskoy said he was not guided neither by evil nor by 
revenge. "Evil comes from evil. There was a bloodshed in 
October 1993 and innocent people perished. If we start clearing 
up our relations there might be a bloodshed again. We will have 
to face the danger of total death," he pointed out. 
  Rutskoy announced that he was to complete his 3-volume book 
within a month (each volume has about 400-500 pages). According 
to him, he saw that the present leaders make nearly every 
mistake against which he had warned. He believes there was no 
reason to let the situation develop into the tragedy. He said 
he did not try to cover politics in his book since he saw no 
necessity to settle accounts or to criticize anybody. 
  Rutskoy believes that there must be civilized economic and 
political relations established in Russia. The rule must be 
carried out through motivation rather than through commands. 
  Commenting on the reforms, Rutskoy emphasized that they must 
be based juridically. "All rallies finally lead to fights," he 
said.

  [Text] Aleksandr Lysenko, the staff member of the Russian 
embassy in Washington who, by agreement with the Russian 
External Intelligence Service (EIS) and the CIS, was introduced 
in Washington as the official representative of the Russian 
Intelligence, is returning to Moscow on Saturday [5 March], Head 
of the EIS's Press Bureau Yuriy Kobaladze told INTERFAX. 
  As we reported earlier, Aleksandr Lysenko arrived in the 
U.S. 
last summer and was declared persona non-grata in connection 
with the Ameses case. Aldrich Ames and his wife Maria were 
accused of spying in favor of the Kremlin for many years. 
  To quote Kobaladze, Moscow's decision to expel high-ranking 
American diplomat James Morris, officially introduced as the CIS 
resident, "is a matter of mutual accounts, rather than a return 
measure." 
  Kobaladze expressed hope that the damage caused by Lysenko's 
and Morris's exile would be minimized. "We reckon on this," he 
said. 
  Asked if Lysenko's successor would be officially introduced 
in Washington as the Russian resident, Kobaladze said that the 
agreement on this was still in force. "However, details will be 
discussed with Americans, on whom very much would depend. We 
have channels for such a discussion," he said. 
  Speaking about Lysenko's career, Kobaladze said that some of 
the American media's reports about Lysenko's further exile to 
Siberia were ungrounded. "His experience and knowledge can be 
used by the EIS where he will continue to work," he said.

  [Text] Sources in the apparatus of the Azerbaijani 
president reported to Interfax that Russia's diplomatic mission 
headed by deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin came to 
Baku in the evening of March 7. The mission has brought a 
renewed variant of the Russian plan on the Karabakh settlement. 
The plan is based on Armenia's and Azerbaijan's compliance with 
the Russian initiative and their readiness to withdraw their 
forces form the hostilities zone. 
  According to the renewed plan, several observation points 
will be deployed along the disengagement line around 
Nagorno-Karabakh. Representatives of Azerbaijan, Armenia and 
Russia will be in the composition of these posts. Main 
coordinating headquarters of peacekeeping forces which are to 
control the cease-fire agreement will apparently be based in the 
Azerbaijani city of Agdam and Karabakh regional center of 
Khankendi (Mardakert). 
  The same sources reported that Vladimir Kazimirov, special 
envoy of the Russian president, would participate in the Baku 
talks.

  [Excerpt] A report we received not so long ago said that 
Azerbaijan's military forces pounded the Armenian defense 
positions in Karabakh and the military unit in Fizuli with 
artillery fire at about 0730 this morning. Later they tried to 
penetrate the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic's defense lines. 
However, thanks to the successful efforts of the Karabakh 
artillery units, the offensive was halted. The Azerbaijani 
units were forced to retreat after suffering several casualties. 
The reports we received as of noon today say that positional 
fighting is continuing at that part of the front line. 
  The situation is tense on other parts of the line of 
confrontation, but relative peace prevails. 
  Meanwhile, the provocations from Azerbaijani territory 
against Armenia seem to be unending. The defense positions 
around Berkaber in Idzhevanskiy Rayon were fired on at 1900 
yesterday. The Armenian border guards refrained from returning 
fire. No one was hurt. 
  The situation along the rest of the Armenian-Azerbaijani 
border has been relatively peaceful. Meanwhile, the neighboring 
republic must realize that it is impossible to involve Armenia 
in the conflict through provocative activities. Armenia 
maintains a peaceful policy.

  [Text] The Armenian presidential press service reported 
that on 7 March Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan received 
Jan Eliasson, chairman of the CSCE Minsk Group, and members of 
his delegation who are visiting the region to obtain first-hand 
information on the situation. 
  The entire complex of matters pertaining to the Karabakh 
conflict, including the peace proposals of CSCE and Russia, were 
discussed during the meeting. Armenian Foreign Minister Vahan 
Papazyan; Armenian First Deputy Foreign Minister Zhirair 
Liparityan; and Davit Shahnazaryan, the Armenian president's 
ambassador on special missions, were present at the meeting. 
  Babken Ararktsyan, chairman of the Armenian Supreme Council, 
also received Jan Eliasson and his delegation today. The 
chairman of the Supreme Council stressed the importance of the 
mission for the [words indistinct] establishment of a cease-fire 
and political settlement of the conflict. 
  In summarizing the results of the CSCE representatives' 
meetings with the party and deputies' groups at the Armenian 
Supreme Council, Ararktsyan affirmed that all political forces 
in the parliament, first of all the Armenian Pannational 
Movement that commands a relative majority, are in favor of the 
speedy establishment of a cease-fire and a negotiated settlement 
of the contentious issues. 
  Babken Ararktsyan also noted that it is possible to expect 
maximum results from the peace efforts only if all mediation 
efforts are coordinated within international organizations, 
particularly within the CSCE framework. Of course, this does 
not preclude the discussion of various other proposals. 
  In his turn, Jan Eliasson noted that the visit to Baku, 
Stepanakert, and Yerevan has convinced him about the existence 
of a real possibility for the establishment of a stable and 
supervisable cease-fire. 
  Readiness was expressed to consistently continue holding 
consultations and regular contacts at various levels to search 
for effective mechanisms for the termination of military 
operations. 
  During the meeting, Babken Ararktsyan also briefed the 
guests 
on the work being carried out on economic and political reforms 
in the republic, and on the future plans. 
  CSCE Minsk Group Chairman Jan Eliasson held a news 
conference 
this evening at the Armenian Foreign Ministry. Our 
correspondent Grigor Guezelyan reports: 
  [Begin Guezelyan recording] CSCE Minsk Chairman Jan Eliasson 
said that their talks and meetings in Baku, Stepanakert, and 
Yerevan were [words indistinct]. He added that following the 
intensive talks, the delegation, which also includes the Swedish 
diplomats Mathias Mossberg and [name indistinct], met with the 
political leadership of the sides, as well as with civilians and 
refugees. [passage indistinct] All sides to the conflict are 
sincerely interested in a peaceful and exclusively political 
settlement of the conflict. The current phase requires a 
political will and readiness to attain peace, noted CSCE Minsk 
chairman. 
  In reply to reporters, Mr. Eliasson noted that the CSCE 
Minsk 
Group is closely cooperating with Russia for the successful 
conclusion of the current mediation efforts. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Boris Soldatenko report: "Russia Is Not Renouncing </F>
Peacemaking Mission in Karabakh, But Warring Sides Must First 
Cease Fire Along Entire Front" -- quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] Despite the agreements reached, the situation on 
the line of confrontation between Armenia and Azerbaijan remains 
volatile. In the light of this, speculation about the "collapse 
of the Russian plan to settle the Karabakh problem" is emerging. 
The warring sides accuse each other of escalating hostilities 
and of armed provocation aimed at sabotaging agreements on a 
cease-fire and the withdrawal of troops to previously agreed 
positions. 
  So what next? Have all possibilities for a peaceful solution 
to the conflict been exhausted? Here is what Colonel General 
Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian deputy defense minister, has to say 
about the situation which has emerged: 
  "Agreement on a 1 March cease-fire was reached and honored. 
But in respect of the troop withdrawal, there have been 
definite problems here. Mutual recriminations will continue 
until such times as the rival armies are separated. Acting as a 
mediator in this instance, I cannot because of this believe 
either side at the moment. 
  To back up his words Georgiy Kondratyev produced two 
telegrams sent to the Russian Defense Ministry by the chairmen 
of the Azerbaijani and Armenian military departments concerning 
the status of hostilities on the morning of 3 March. The 
Azerbaijani Armed Forces chief of General Staff reports that the 
Armenian side continues to attack Azeri positions from the 
populated areas of Ashagi, Seydakhmeldy, and Kargan. The 
Armenian defense minister also reports that hostilities took 
place in this region, but makes no mention of the Azerbaijani 
Army's offensive reported by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic's 
military department. 
  "So who is to be believed?" Colonel General Kondratyev 
continues. "Until a 15- to 20-km security zone is set up, units 
and subunits from both sides are withdrawn from this zone, and 
posts erected with the participation of Russian observers, I, as 
a neutral party, cannot accuse either side of violating the 
agreements. In other words, until I have my own 'eyes' there, I 
cannot say precisely who began the offensive. 
  As we know, on 2 March the Russian Defense Ministry 
delivered 
a list of the latest proposals for the cessation of hostilities 
in the conflict region. In particular, the first point proposes 
that all sides take the necessary measures to continue honoring 
the cease-fire regime. In the second and third points it is 
proposed that the sides withdraw combat hardware and armaments 
to the agreed areas in the period 2 through 4 March. It is also 
proposed that in the period 3 through 5 March the parties 
implement the mutual separation of the sides' troops in two 
sectors, Mardakert and Fizuli, with the subsequent erection 
there of mixed observation posts. 
  The Armenian Defense Ministry wholly agreed to honor all its 
commitments -- but only if representatives of the Azerbaijani 
Army and the army of Nagorno-Karabakh do the same. In its turn, 
the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry categorically refused to carry 
out points two and three and demanded the liberation of 
territories seized by Armenian armed formations. While the army 
of Nagorno-Karabakh, laying down no conditions, expressed a 
readiness to take all measures to continue upholding the 
cease-fire regime, and by the evening of 2 March it had begun 
the partial withdrawal of armored equipment from the front 
line.... 
  Obviously, the situation is extremely complex. And without a 
more detailed study, Russia cannot honor its commitments 
enshrined in the talks protocol ratified by all four sides. 
Here, Russia is assigned the right, in the event of a violation 
of the accords reached on the cessation of hostilities in the 
security zones and monitored areas, to apply all necessary 
measures of influence, up to and including military measures, 
against formations which have flouted the terms of the current 
protocol. This protocol provision cannot work, as the actual 
security zone does not exist today; it is marked only on the 
maps of the Russian Defense Ministry representatives. 
  "Even if our proposals are ignored, we will not, 
nevertheless, sit back with arms folded," Georgiy Kondratyev 
says. "I have already met with Azerbaijan's ambassador in 
Moscow and proposed that a plenipotentiary representative of the 
highest rank be appointed for negotiations. We will fly with 
him to Armenia and resume talks. 
  As for the Russian soldiers, they will not be seen in the 
conflict region, according to a statement by Colonel General 
Kondratyev, until the gunfire abates and the hostile sides are 
disengaged.

<F P=106> [From 5 March RAHVA HAAL, HOMMIKULEHT, p 1, 3; "News </F>
Bulletin" No. 44/94] 
  [Text] Monday, March 7 -- A special session of the 
Estonian Government decided to propose high-level consultation 
to Russia in order to settle the differences between the two 
countries. The government also protested against Russia's 
attempts to destabilise the situation in the Baltic region and 
demanded that the troops withdrawal be completed by August 31. 
The Estonian Government statement stressed Estonia's 
willingness to continue the negotiations. 
  Prime Minister Mart Laar told the journalists that the 
Russian additional conditions, including the demand of 23 
million dollars, contradict Russia's international obligation of 
a speedy, orderly and complete withdrawal. "The Estonian side 
never promised them any compensation," Laar said. 
  Foreign Minister Juri Luik explained that the consultations 
would help to settle the differences and to continue the talks. 
He also pointed out the threat of the Russian military 
presence, referring to the recent fire in a Russian military 
unit near Paldiski. 
  Riigikogu [parliament] Foreign Affairs Commission Chairman 
Vello Saatpalu had recommended to continue the negotiations in 
the territory of a third country, but Friday's [4 March] 
government session did not discuss it, government spokesman Ain 
Saarna said.

Estonia and Latvia "as quickly as possible," German Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel says in an article published in Saturday's 
[5 March] edition of the DIE WELT newspaper. 
  The article, titled "The Future of the Baltic States is in 
Europe", notes that with the Baltic states regaining their 
independence in 1991, "the injustice, which began with the 
Hitler-Stalin pact of 1939, was corrected." 
  "The sphere-of-influence-guided thinking of those days must 
not come up again. The Baltic region has been and will remain 
one of the regions in Europe that are particularly sensitive in 
recording the big tectonic shifts of our time." 
  Kinkel says it is now one of the most urgent tasks to see to 
it that the Russian Army units still remaining in Estonia and 
Latvia were pulled out. There is no reason to delay this or 
make the process dependent on conditions not directly related to 
it, the German foreign minister says, adding that there can be 
no justification to keeping one's troops on the soil of an 
independent country without that the latter so wishes. 
  The German foreign minister also states that his country is 
putting its full support behind the Baltic countries progressing 
toward a full member's status in the European Union. 
  As an intercessor for, and protector of the the Baltic 
states, Germany wants the European Agreement to be signed with 
these countries still this year. The European Union would be 
imperfect without the Baltics, Kinkel says. 
  "Europe is not only a geographical but also a cultural 
concept. The future of the Baltic states is in Europe," the 
minister concludes.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 07, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar in an interview with BNS expressed his disappointment 
with the decisions adopted by last week's congress meeting of 
the country's farm sector representatives. 
  He said it had seemed that many of the activists there had 
gathered only to gain political capital for themselves rather 
than discuss the topical problems facing the farm sector. 
  The prime minister in his address had reassured the farmers 
of the government's commitment to speeding up the reform in 
agriculture. But he said the government's efforts had met with 
little understanding and that many questions posed by him at the 
meeting had been left without answer. 
  Laar said a wish to limit the congress to complaining and 
letting one's emotions show had been greatly in evidence among 
speakers. "Many speakers found that farmers need no World Bank 
credits, and doubted in the necessity of a free trade treaty 
with the European Union. But both of these are badly necessary 
to the farmers," he said. 
  "If during the discussion on the property reform one speaks 
of the need to introduce direct election of the president and, 
with respect to protecting the domestic market, the prime 
minister is scolded for traveling around in the country, the 
future of the rural sector apparently seems dark," Laar said. 
  "Looking at the luxury cars that had gathered around the 
Vanemuine theatre (where the congress took place) in Tartu, one 
could at least state that the representatives of the rural 
people are not having a bad life," he added.

  [Text] Monday, March 7 -- Estonia will have to build an 
ammunition factory within a year in order to guarantee a 
sufficient supply of ammunition for its armed forces, Riigikogu 
[parliament] Defence Commission Chairman Rein Helme announced. 
The factory should also produce antipersonnel and antitank 
mines, he added. 
  Helme explained that the factory could cooperate with the 
oil 
shale mining firm "Eesti Pdlevkivi", which intends to build an 
explosives factory for its own needs. The intended factory 
might also service and repair arms or produce weapons for 
Estonia's defence forces, he added. Cooperation offers have 
been received from Israel and South Africa. The production of 
ammunition would reinforce Estonia's international position, 
Helme stressed, but pointed out that the Baltic market would be 
insufficient for a larger factory.

Foundation for Mutual Settlements Between Belarusian and 
Ukrainian Armies"] 
  [Text] The Belarusian military delegation, led by 
Belarusian Defense Minister Colonel General Kozlovskiy, returned 
from Ukraine where it held negotiations with Ukrainian Defense 
Minister Radetskyy. 
  During the visit, it discussed prospects for cooperation 
between the two Armies in the materiel and technical sphere, 
logistic support, and training of military specialists. 
  The economic crisis in our republics sharply curtailed the 
ability of their Armies to purchase new equipment and weapons. 
It is the times and situation that call for the states to 
cooperate on a par basis. The barter system and the dollar will 
become the foundation for mutual settlements between Belarusian 
and Ukrainian Armies. 
  The sides reached an agreement that Ukraine will commit 
itself to training engineering personnel for the Belarusian 
Army, in particular, electronics specialists. For its part, 
Belarus is ready to offer its military college facilities for 
the training of Ukrainian lieutenants. Also, military equipment 
surplus will be exchanged or sold to each other. 
  The sides agreed to continue working meetings and 
consultations.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS 7 Mar -- The preliminary 
results of the poll "What People Advise" show that over 
two-thirds of people included in the lists have attended the 
polling stations. Over 90 percent of the participants 
pronounced for Moldova's territorial integrity, stated today to 
the National Radio Mihai Coscodan, chairman of the Republic 
Commission for running the poll, Moldovan vice premier. 
Coscodan said the poll will be a heavy blow for separatists in 
Tiraspol and Comrat. Previously, Ovidiu Badina, director of 
Sociological Service for Researching the Public Opinion and 
Market (SCOP), told BASAPRESS that the scientific value of this 
poll is null since the two rules essential for any poll are not 
respected -- the question is not formulated exactly; it consists 
of several components and it is not clear to which of the 
answers "Yes" and "No" refer.

<F P=106> [Interview with Iurie Rosca, leader of the Christian </F>
Democratic Popular Front of Moldova, by Corina Caramete on 28 
February; place not given: "A Gloomy Future for Bessarabia"] 
  [Text] [Caramete] After partial results have been 
announced, what do you think the future composition of the 
Republic of Moldova's Parliament will be? 
  [Rosca] I believe that the Communist Block [The Democratic 
Agrarian Party, the Socialist Party and the Edinstvo, and the 
Social Democratic Party] has ensured itself two-thirds of the 
votes. We can say that the Alliance of the Democratic Christian 
Popular Front [AFPCD] did not succeed in winning elections in 
competition with Russia. We had to compete with Russia. The 
balance of forces was somehow unequal. 
  [Caramete] The AFPCD nevertheless will have 10 
parliamentarians. 
  [Rosca] Something like that. 
  [Caramete] Logically, Ilie Ilascu's release should follow 
now, he was the second candidate on the AFPCD lists. 
  [Rosca] This would be normal. However, it is certain that 
the struggle for his liberation will intensify, providing that 
he succeeds in ending his current hunger strike and stays 
healthy. 
  [Caramete] According to the law he should be released. 
  [Rosca] Certainly. When we enter parliament, the first 
issue that we will table will be the release of Ilies Ilascu and 
his group and the majority will not risk spoiling its image by 
failing to support such an initiative. 
  [Caramete] It is possible that the parliamentary majority 
will support this idea in word only. 
  [Rosca] Yes, it is possible, as has happened in the past two 
years. However, when we are in parliament we will be able to 
see whether something is indeed being done or whether everything 
stops at certain futile declarations that can cover up the 
complicity between the authorities of Chisinau and Tiraspol. 
  [Caramete] Are you going to dispute the elections? 
  [Rosca] We advanced several appeals disputing the results 
during the electoral campaign and now, too, one day after the 
elections. We will set down all cases of violation of the 
electoral law, but these appeals certainly can have only a 
propagandistic character. I do not think that they will have 
any legal consequences for the current leadership, especially 
considering -- as far as I could notice -- that the 
international observers who were here almost unanimously 
recognize the correctness of elections. I even heard somebody 
who represented the Council of Europe saying on Chisinau radio 
that the elections took place without violence. As if violations 
were carried out with tanks. Thus, I do not believe that we 
will obtain more than to succeed in drawing the public's 
attention at home and abroad to the fact that these elections 
were not democratic. Everything that is state authority, from 
the very top down to the mayor's office, had been put at the 
service of the Agrarian Democratic Party. 
  [Caramete] How do you think the political situation is going 
to develop in the future? 
  [Rosca] The prospects are pretty gloomy. The program of the 
Communist Block is known: federalization and immediate 
adherence to the CIS. Thus, for the first time the 1940 
occupation will be legalized definitively. Then, the law 
regarding the official language will be reviewed and possibly 
the 14th Army will be transformed from an occupying army into a 
long-term Russian military base to ensure peace and stability in 
the area. I believe that unfortunately the West will hail such 
an idea. Probably the aggression of official anti-Romanian 
propaganda will increase and new attempts to condemn the idea of 
unification [with Romania] will follow. However, what the 
imperialists always overlook are the fundamental human feelings: 
a religious, and then a national feeling. In no way can these be 
defeated by totalitarianism or a parliamentary majority. I was 
talking with my colleagues the night of the elections about what 
is going to be the first initiative of our parliamentary group. 
We will turn to the parliamentary majority with the request to 
let us keep our alphabet. Thus, this would be the last 
stronghold. We might feel pretty bad if, in a probable 
multinational state, it were finally recognized that we are a 
Moldovan people and that we speak the Moldovan language [in 
contrast to Romanian]. Just as dramatic will be the 
discontinuation of relations with Romania in the area of 
education and educational programs. 
  [Caramete] Have you thought about opposing the anti-Romanian 
offensive? 
  [Rosca] Ilie Ilascu's book was issued in 250,000 copies. We 
have paved Bessarabia with this book and this is the most useful 
and most concise history of the Romanians and the most touching 
assertion of the national identity in the present Republic of 
Moldova. We are also preparing a long-term plan for our 
activity and I believe that everything will turn out fine, 
because communists do not understand this, namely that anything 
that is against God will collapse, sometimes very rapidly and 
spectacularly.

<F P=106> [Petr Karapetyan report: "Sergey Shakhray on the Amnesty </F>
and the Concept of Civil Reconciliation"] 
  [Text] Sergey Shakhray met with journalists 5 March. At 
your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondewnt's request he gave his 
version of the political amnesty declared by the State Duma. 
Who gained from it? I believe, Shakhray said, that the prime 
benefactor of this amnesty is Russian society. But, he 
stressed, both the president and the prime minister gained, too. 
What form does this take? When the passions and emotions 
subside it will perhaps transpire that the interests of the 
president and the Duma coincided, albeit tactically. Some Duma 
deputies have achieved their aim in entering the Duma -- to 
secure the release of the participants in the October events. 
Subsequently the Duma's interests will diverge from those of 
the ex-prisoners because the Duma has leaders of its own who do 
not want the reinforcement of Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and the 
rest. They have no interest in that. In addition, they are not 
averse to preserving their image as initiators of civil 
reconciliation. After all, that is also politically very 
advantageous. 
  The president and the government, in turn, benefit more from 
having Khasbulatov and Rutskoy at liberty than in Lefortovo 
prison. Why is that? So long as they remain in jail they 
create the impression of an imprisoned vice president and an 
imprisoned Supreme Soviet chairman. But once they have accepted 
the amnesty from the Duma's hands then, no matter what 
reservations they may have, they will have admitted a degree of 
political guilt. Now each of them can return to power only 
after elections have been held. 
  In addition, the amnesty act averted the acute political 
crisis that was expected in April-May. Society has been given a 
respite of several months. That respite must be used by all 
political forces to prevent clashes. I believe, Sergey Shakhray 
said, that the political amnesty saved Chernomyrdin's job as 
premier and strengthened the president's position because it 
muddled the political alignment of forces which were prepared 
for a crisis this spring.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the rubric "In the State Duma": </F>
"Deputies Concerned Over Press Freedom"] 
  [Text] At a meeting with chief editors, State Duma 
Chairman Ivan Rybkin proposed the formation of a working group 
to prepare a draft law on the functioning of the mass media in 
1994-1995. According to initial reports, this group is to 
include newspaper editors and representatives of news agencies 
and television and radio broadcasting companies. 
  The editors cited as the causes of the current crisis of the 
"fourth estate" the monopolism of the Ministry of Communications 
and the impossibility of destatizing printing plants with the 
participation of editorial collectives. In the words of Pavel 
Gusev, chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists, the 
mechanism for subsidizing publications must be immediately 
changed, creating equal conditions of survival for them. It was 
also observed that all branches of power should be legislatively 
prohibited from being sponsors of mass media. 
  Ivan Rybkin gave assurances that the State Duma has no 
"pretensions to run or control the press." He stressed that the 
State Duma intends to support the mass media and save them from 
the "burden of ruthless economic censorship." 
  Ivan Rybkin proposed that mass media leaders join in 
elaborating the draft law on the functioning of the mass media 
in 1994-1995, which will enable the press to secure a dignified 
existence in the crisis period. In his opinion, this draft law 
should include priority measures to ensure the press' survival. 
The draft law is due to be examined in session by the State 
Duma in late April.

  [Text] President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk met 
representatives of the business community and leaders of the 
Jewish organizations in New York on Sunday. What needs to be 
done to attract foreign capital to Ukraine? What economic 
assistance needs to be given to Ukraine at this stage of market 
reforms? These and many other topical questions on 
U.S.-Ukrainian economic relations were in the center of 
attention at the meeting with U.S. business circle 
representatives. It was attended by representatives of about 20 
largest corporations of North America. The meeting was held 
behind closed doors, the press was not invited. 
  According to one of the Ukrainian delegation members who 
took 
part in the discussion, it concerned promising opportunities for 
investment in concrete sectors of the Ukrainian economy which 
are of interest to U.S. corporations. Many questions were put 
to the Ukrainian delegation about opportunities for capital 
investments in power engineering, transport, the metal industry 
and defense enterprises undergoing conversion. 
  President Kravchuk said in his address that Ukraine had 
lately passed a number of important legislative acts on 
privatization and protection of foreign investments. The head 
of state also stressed that Ukraine is undergoing transition to 
a market economy in conditions of a deep economic crisis. He 
urged U.S. entrepreneurs to be bolder in exploring the Ukrainian 
market and to set up close trade ties. 
  Also on Sunday, the president of Ukraine held a small 
meeting 
with the management of a large U.S. corporation, Morgan. They, 
too, discussed specific projects for investments in Ukraine. 
  Leonid Kravchuk spoke on Sunday to the heads of leading 
Jewish public organizations of the United States. He said, in 
particular, that a number of laws had been passed in Ukraine 
lately on human rights and protection of the public's religious 
freedom. 
  We have now begun to live according to the rules of the 
civilized world, the president said. 
  The head of state noted that over 500,000 Jews are living in 
the republic today. It is one of the largest ethnic groups in 
our state," Kravchuk said. Ukrainians, Jews and other ethnic 
groups are working together for the benefit of our country and 
increasing its wealth." The president stressed the special 
importance of the treaty signed in Washington a few days ago 
between the leadership of the United States and Ukraine, 
according to which, the governments of both countries commit 
themselves to joint efforts in assisting the protection and 
conservation of historical places which are of great 
significance for the cultural heritage of Ukraine and the United 
States.

  [Text] New York March 7 TASS -- Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk said there is a direct connection between Ukraine's 
nuclear weapons and its economic status. Speaking at a news 
conference devoted to the results of his visit to the United 
States in New York City on Monday, Kravchuk said that "when 
Ukraine gets rid of the last nuclear missile, its economy will 
be freed from the heavy burden and the republic will be able to 
step up the process of reform." 
  "We realise that the West links nuclear weapons with 
assistance to reform programmes. But I would like to say that 
the process of freeing oneself from nuclear weapons is not 
directly connected with the process of reform. When discussing 
this question, we proceed from the possibility of providing us 
with security guarantees. If the economic situation continues 
to worsen, it will be harder for us to carry out the processes 
which we have pledged to carry out. This is true not only of 
nuclear weapons, but also of the country's debt," Kravchuk said. 
  "It should be understood that in conditions of economic 
chaos 
it is extremely hard to fulfil one's obligations. Ukraine is 
not trying to play a `nuclear card.' We are speaking about 
absolutely logical facts which should be taken into 
consideration. The first trainload of nuclear warheads has 
already arrived in Russia. Ukraine is adherent to the 
three-party accords signed in Moscow. But it must be helped in 
carrying out the process of nuclear disarmament, not hampered," 
the Ukrainian leader said.

  [Text] New York March 7 TASS -- "I am quite satisfied with 
my visit to the United States during which important bilateral 
documents were signed," Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said. 
  Speaking at a news conference devoted to the results of his 
visit to the United States in New york City on Monday, Kravchuk 
said that "we have discussed a whole spectrum of issues of 
mutually beneficial cooperation in the economic and other 
spheres. We held talks with the U.S. leadership as a democratic 
and independent state. All this has been recorded in respective 
American-Ukrainian documents, as well as statements made by 
President (Bill) Clinton. The next step would be the 
fulfillment by the Ukrainian side of all its obligations which 
we have assumed." 
  "I would not link the success of the meeting with those 
credits which the United States has promised to grant us. The 
credits will not be able to provide for full economic recovery 
of the country anyway. They may help only when the economic 
mechanism begins working. But now we need U.S. investments and 
technological assistance badly," Kravchuk said.

  [Text] New York March 7 TASS -- "Ukraine will be seeking to 
pay off all its debts to Russia. But it cannot afford this now 
because it has no financial means," Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk said. 
  Speaking at a news conference devoted to the results of his 
visit to the United States in New York City on Monday, Kravchuk 
said that the termination of Russian gas supplies to Ukraine may 
worsen the economic crisis in the republic and cause a social 
explosion. 
  "We did not stop holding talks with the Russian side on this 
issue. They have been held on a permanent basis. We have 
really no money to pay in hard currency. The paradox is that we 
can supply Russia with various manufactured goods for roubles -- 
for example railway carriages or pipes -- but Russian 
enterprises cannot buy them because they themselves have no 
money. We cannot earn hard currency either, because Ukraine has 
not so far received a quota for exports to the United States. 
It's a vicious circle," Kravchuk said.

  [Text] A Ukrainian government delegation headed by 
President Leonid Kravchuk on Monday finished its visit to the 
United States. Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy 
told reporters that during talks with the head of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, General John Shalikashvili, it was decided to 
hold joint military exercises and establish a direct 
communications line between the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and 
the U.S. defense Department. It was also agreed that U.S. 
defense Secretary William Perry would visit Ukraine on March 
21-23. 
  According to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko, the 
two countries' relations have risen to a "new level." "The 
American administration has completely revised its policy 
towards Ukraine," Zlenko said. The United States saw it as 
essential that "Ukraine should remain an independent and 
sovereign state," because Ukraine's loss of independence "may 
upset the balance of power in Europe," he said. 
  Zlenko said the two nations had considerably stepped up 
their 
economic relations. Thus, America had allocated $700 mn as aid 
to Ukraine, and the latter would also receive assistance from 
the World Bank and other international financial bodies, he 
said. A team of U.S. experts is shortly due to arrive in 
Ukraine to determine priorities in the two countries' economic 
relations, Zlenko said.

  [Text] Sevastopol, 6 Mar -- The so-called patriotic forces 
of Sevastopol have held a rally. In its election statement, the 
Bloc of Patriotic Forces heavily criticized the U.S. and 
Ukrainian presidents for "plotting to continue Ukraine's 
Nazi-style occupation of the Russian peninsula of Crimea." The 
participants in the rally voiced their unanimous contempt for 
Clinton and Kravchuk, saying they are doomed to "the pitiful 
fate of all invaders of Russian territories." 
  The rally approved an appeal to Yevhen Saburov, the future 
prime minister of Crimea, demanding "an end to all talk of 
Crimea being a part of Ukraine." The rally urged "all patriots 
of Russia" to boycott the election to the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine and the election to the Supreme Council of Crimea 
according to party lists. The "patriots of Russia" proposed 
voting for their own candidates to the Supreme Council of 
Crimea, whose list was announced at the end of the rally.

  [Text] Ye. Saburov, who was offered the post of Crimean 
vice premier, told our correspondent that the political 
situation on the peninsula interested him from one point of view 
only: Whether it will make it possible to develop a free 
economy in the Crimea. He said that on 4 and 5 March, he would 
go to Moscow to hold meetings with Russian and foreign 
structures, whose representatives he would like to invite to the 
Crimea. Then he will fly to London for the same purpose. He 
plans to return to the Crimea in three or four weeks and get 
down to work, provided that the parliament approves his status 
as vice premier. He does not intend to adopt Ukrainian 
citizenship. However, Chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council 
N. Bagrov said that he would not allow Saburov to occupy such a 
high post. 
  Meanwhile, a strike committee represented by the bloc of 
pro-Russian forces and trade union leaders was created in 
Sevastopol. The strike committee submitted a package of draft 
resolutions for the forthcoming city council session. The 
package includes a draft resolution on transferring Sevastopol 
to Russian jurisdiction.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Maslennikov: "Economy Taken Hostage By a </F>
Shortsighted Policy"] 
  [Text] Simferopol -- And so Crimea has made its choice. At 
his first press conference, Republic of Crimea President Yu.A. 
Meshkov named three basic causes of our problems and anxieties 
today: the collapse of the economy, paralysis of authority, and 
rampant crime. 
  Indeed, the "market" we have allegedly built more closely 
resembles a wild flea market. This is happening because our 
economy has fallen victim to the shortsighted decisions and 
actions of woeful politicians who have ruined a unified country 
and a unified national economic complex built over decades. 
After all, it is absolutely essential that political concepts 
coincide with the functioning of objective economic laws. The 
introduction of Ukraine's own currency--the karbovanets--has 
resulted in nothing but chaos for the financial system and has 
sharply undermined the standard of living of the populace, 
putting many of us on the edge of extinction. Only the various 
kinds of profiteers and bureaucrats can feel free under the new 
conditions as they line their pockets with the distribution of 
all the people's assets. 
  Task number one for the first president of Crimea is to put 
a 
tight lid on profiteering and so-called "grab-it-ization." 
  The new Government of the Republic of Crimea must draw 
conclusions from the negative experience of "the Bagrov team" 
and further to the greatest possible extent restoration of the 
economic ties with Russia and other CIS countries which were 
destroyed. And in order to diminish at least in some way the 
grave consequences of the current collapse of ties, we must 
utilize local conditions and resources more fully. We might 
consider as an example in this regard the reforms of the Vrangel 
government, and indeed--NEP. 
  A proper resolution to issues in the development of 
agriculture and sectors of the processing industry would not 
only help resolve the food problem which is so painful for us, 
but would also enable us to accumulate funds to treat social 
needs. But it is my deep conviction that our most important 
source of wealth--the land-- cannot constitute the object of 
buying and selling. It must belong to those who will cultivate 
it conscientiously. 
  It is also necessary at the state level to examine questions 
pertaining to increased housing construction (last year only 
8,600 apartments were built in Crimea) and assistance to Crimean 
resort areas. Of course, these tasks will not be accomplished 
while proceeding along the path of Kiev's current isolationist 
policy. We need decisive steps to be taken towards economic 
sovereignty, especially in the conduct of Crimea's financial 
(budgetary and tax) policy. 
  We must reform our tax system, especially since Crimea will 
henceforth be conducting a tax policy independent of that of 
Ukraine. Taxes must be levied for the budget based on one 
indicator of production or production realization. This will 
lead to improved accounting and control, and will downsize 
financial organs. In such event, it would be advantageous to 
unite the finance and tax departments of Crimea into one 
institution. 
  In order to overcome the current paralysis of power and the 
rampant crime related to it, we must elect to the Supreme 
Council of Crimea and to local organs of authority as many 
honest and decent people as possible, true professionals who 
have not sullied themselves either in shady dealings in the 
sphere of "grab-it-ization" or links with our state-trade mafia, 
in other words--with that very environment that engenders crime 
on the state scale.

<F P=106> [Anatoliy Polyakov report under the "Postscriptum: Events </F>
and Commentaries" rubric: "Was There a Generals' `Conspiracy'? 
Six Members of Ukrainian Air Force Military Council Have Come 
Out Against the President's Edict"] 
  [Text] Kiev -- Something unprecedented has occurred in the 
Ukrainian Army. President Leonid Kravchuk issued an edict 
appointing Lieutenant General Volodymyr Antonets commander of 
the Air Force. As soon as this became known, all six members of 
the Air Force Military Council (with the exception, naturally, 
of Antonets himself) signed the Military Council's decision on 
their collective resignation. 
  What, then, is the essence of the generals' "conspiracy"? In 
the past, at the instigation of former Ukrainian Defense 
Minister Konstantin Morozov, Gen. Antonets was appointed by the 
president as commander of the Air Defense Troops, whose creation 
by means of merging Air Defense and the Air Force he himself had 
initiated. This led not only to the formation of a new staff 
structure with 250 generals and colonels but also to... the 
further breakdown of the Air Defense and the Air Force. 
  This was precisely why Leonid Kravchuk was forced to repeal 
his edict creating the Air Defense Troops. Antonets became 
commander of the Air Force. 
  But why are the generals categorically opposed to Volodymyr 
Antonets? There are several reasons. One of them is that it 
was with the support of Antonets that a right-wing organization, 
which is essentially a political party -- the Ukrainian Officers 
Union -- was active in the Air Force. With his assistance 
members of the UNSO [Ukrainian People's Self-Defense] 
organization wounded in Georgia were treated in military 
hospitals. Generals V. Vasilyev and G. Kolodiy, who fought in 
Afghanistan and have rich experience in troop control, have 
declared their reluctance, so the newspaper KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI 
writes, to serve under the command of someone who does not have 
the necessary knowledge to lead the Air Force and whose main 
character trait is arrogance.

  [Text] The Ukrainian security officer Major Anatoliy 
Lysenko, sentenced by a court in Poland to two years in prison 
on Saturday for espionage against that country and for 
recruiting Polish citizens, has been expelled from Poland and 
has returned to Ukraine. That was reported to Interfax by the 
Ukrainian border troops press-service on Monday. 
  At a news-conference on the border between the two 
countries, 
journalists have been told that Kiev disagrees with the verdict 
and will instruct its Embassy in Poland to appeal the court's 
decision. Border officers described the case with Lysenko as a 
crude provocation. Major Lysenko was detained in Poland at the 
end of August last year. In his words, his trip was private.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "A Political Opponent? Put Him </F>
Behind Bars!"] 
  [Text] A group of people's deputies has turned to 
Ukraine's Procurator General V. Datsyuk with a protest in 
connection with the recent search of the headquarters of the 
Ukrainian Nationalist Assembly (UNA) and private apartments of 
individual UNA members. The search was sanctioned by Hariy 
Shevchenko, Procurator of Pechersk Rayon [in Kiev]. As already 
reported in the press, at that time, about 30 UNA members were 
detained, including four candidates for people's deputies. The 
authors of the protest are trying to find out from the 
Procurator General what social danger these people present so as 
to enable the Procurator's Office to violate the status of 
immunity of candidates for Ukraine's people's deputies. Perhaps 
our legislators want, in this manner, to show their activity 
instead of intensifying the struggle against corruption and 
organized crime? 
  The group of people's deputies, including Kateryna Zavadska, 
Iryna Kalynets, Mykhaylo Kosiv, Stepan Khmara, Ihor Yukhnovskyy, 
Ivan Makar, and Mykhaylo Batih, all together 21 people, regards 
this action as a trial of strength in unleashing a campaign of 
political repression on the Ukrainian people and political 
organizations that stand up for the right to a decent life in 
the Ukrainian state. The people's deputies concluded their 
protest against the attempt to use law enforcement agencies to 
deal with political opponents with a demand that those arrested 
be released without delay.

  [Text] Washington March 7 TASS -- "We are in despair. The 
country is on the verge of famine. If it were not for the help 
from the United States, we would have real famine now," Georgian 
leader Eduard Shevardnadze said. 
  Speaking at a business meeting at the Overseas Private 
Investment Corporation in Washington on Monday, on the first day 
of his two-day visit to the U.S., Shevardnadze said that the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union was a painful blow to Georgia 
which had been left without traditional energy and medicine 
supplies. Only humanitarian aid, mostly from the U.S., keeps 
300,000 Abkhazian refugees alive. The amount of such aid reached 
225 million U.S. dollars in the last two years, he said. 
  The Georgian leader stressed that his government "firmly 
follows the path of peaceful settlement" of the Abkhazian 
conflict and expressed "the absolute confidence" that "positive 
results" will be reached in the near future. "The threat of the 
resumption of a civil war has passed," he said. 
  Shevardnadze assured American business people that there is 
a 
favourable climate for foreign investments in Georgia. "Within a 
year or two there will be a change for the better. I would not 
be here if I were not absolutely sure that Georgia's movement to 
free markets and democracy is irreversible," he said.

  [Text] Washington March 8 TASS -- On Monday U.S. President 
Bill Clinton held talks with President of Georgia Eduard 
Shevardnadze, who arrived here on an official visit. The talks 
focussed on Georgia's request to despatch U.N. peacekeeping 
forces to Abkhazia and prospects for widenning U.S. aid to 
Tbilisi. At the end of the talks the two leaders signed a 
declaration of principles of relations, and also an agreement on 
mutual encouragement and protection to investments. 
  During the meeting President Clinton said that the United 
States decisively supports chairman Shevardnadze and the 
territorial integrity of Georgia. He mentioned difficult times 
which Georgia is living through and expressed belief that the 
Georgian people will overcome hardships and build a calmer and 
more flourishing future. He assured the guest that if the 
Georgian-Abkhazian talks crown with a durable political 
settlement, the united states will be inclined to support a U.N. 
peacemaking operation in Georgia. However, the U.S. President 
added that the American armed forces must not participate in it. 
  The U.S. President noted that his country intends to render 
humanitarian aid worth 70 million dollars. We affirm our 
readiness to broaden economic and technical assistance to 
Georgia while it keeps moving towards peace, Clinton said. 
  "Georgia, like other states of the former Soviet Union, 
needs 
foreign aid," in turn, Shevadnadze said. "Without Western 
assistance we cannot succeed in the transition towards democracy 
and a free market economy... Georgia supports the 'partnership 
for peace' programme put forward by Bill Clinton, and hopes to 
take an active part in implementing it. I have appraised the 
president of our approach towards finding a solution to the 
Abkhazian conflict, and intend to furnish our stand on this 
problem in detail during the U.N. Security Council session on 
this problem to be held on march 9," Shevardnadze said. 
  "During the talks we also discussed events in Russia. I 
spoke in favour of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the 
policy he is conducting. We exchanged assessments of tendencies 
of the develoment of the situation in russia. We share an 
interest in strengthening democracy in Russia. Events in moscow 
will inevitably have great affect on contiguous countries," 
Shevardnadze emphasised. 
  The Georgian head of state began the official part of his 
visit with an address to the U.S. government corporation of 
private capital investments abroad. "We are in a desperate 
state," he said addressing representatives of the American 
business world. "The country is on the verge of hunger. If no 
U.S. aid had arrived, we would have been facing hunger in its 
true sense," Shevardnadze said. He called on American 
entrepreneurs to broaden the volume of capital investments in 
the Georgian economy, assuring that the maximum possible 
favourable conditions will be for them in Georgia. "A turning 
point will come in two-three years. I would not have come here, 
if I were not absolutely confident that Georgia's transition 
towards a free market economy and democracy is irreversible," 
the Georgian head of state noted. 
  The same day Shevardnadze visited the Pentagon, where he 
held 
talks with U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry and chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalkashvili. At the end of the 
meeting the two sides signed a memorandum of cooperation between 
the two countries in the military sphere. 
  On Monday Shevardnadze also held a meeting with director of 
the U.S. Agency for International Development Brian Atwood. 
They discussed questions concerning the implementation of the 
U.S. Programme of techinal and economic aid to Georgia through 
channels of this federal department.

  [Text] Washington March 8 TASS -- Russian State Duma 
chairman Ivan Rybkin held a brief talk with Georgian head of 
state Eduard Shevardnadze, who is on an official visit in 
Washington, here on Monday night. 
  After the meeting Ivan Rybkin said in an exclusive interview 
with ITAR-TASS that he discussed with Shevardnadze a wide range 
of bilateral problems. We display keen interest in establishing 
peace throughout the Transcaucasus, the Russian parliamentarian 
emphasised. 
  Recently the Georgian parliament voted for the conuntry's 
joining the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Debates 
on this issue and voting were very difficult, and I 
congratulated Shevardnadze with such a positive outcome, Rybkin 
said. We have agreed to maintain close, virtually daily 
contacts both at the level of the two countries' parliaments and 
personal level, he said.

  [Text] The United States supported and still supports 
Georgia and welcomes the official visit to America by Eduard 
Shevardnadze, chairman of the Georgian parliament and head of 
state, according to Kent Brown, U.S. ambassador extraordinary 
and plenipotentiary in a conversation with a SAKINFORM 
correspondent. 
  He said: I do not have the slightest doubt that this visit 
will be a new beginning in the relations between our countries, 
the relations for which we have made great efforts together and 
worked hard; especially great in this respect is Eduard 
Shevardnadze's role. He is respected and loved throughout the 
world as well as in the United States. The American 
administration, the American people supported and will support 
Georgia's independence, the country's territorial integrity and 
its inviolability. 
  Several kinds of aid have been mapped out during Eduard 
Shevardnadze's visit both in trade and economy as well as the 
political aspect. I am very sorry that the conflict in Abkhazia 
has considerably hampered the good goals which have not yet been 
fully achieved. I hope that in the not too distant future we 
will see international peacekeeping forces deployed in Abkhazia, 
but before this happens many problems must be overcome and 
Shevardnadze's visit to the United States is very important in 
resolving these issues. 
  We are living in an age when it is impossible to stay 
indifferent to the problems of one particular region or country. 
These problems influence the fate of others. Today's 
integration is very deep and from that point of view the 
Caucasus is the region of danger; it must be in the center of 
our attention, and it will be. I am sure that the meetings in 
Washington and New York will be beneficial to Georgia, the U.S. 
ambassador concluded.

<F P=106> [Interview with Georgian head of state Eduard Shevardnadze </F>
by correspondent Nato Oniani; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] Yesterday, Eduard Shevardnadze, the chairman of the 
Georgian Parliament and head of state, granted an interview to 
Georgian radio and television, which we broadcast late last 
night. We are presenting a recording of the interview again. 
The interviewer is Nato Oniani, a journalist. 
  [Oniani] Batono [Georgian polite address] Eduard, a decision 
on Georgia joining the CIS caused rather a strong reaction among 
our deputies. A view was expressed that Georgia did not have to 
look at Russia as a protector and savior, that this was a loss 
of the sovereignty achieved in years, that Russia still 
continued to try to accomplish its own aims, that is, the 
restoration of the Russian Empire and that help had to be sought 
elsewhere, because it will be impossible to speak about 
friendship with a country that itself prompts the issues to talk 
about. 
  [Shevardnadze] Thank you. I would like the TV viewers to 
pardon me for repeating some parts from my speech at the 
parliament sitting, because I have had to return to the debates 
three times today. I regard this as a landmark in Georgian 
history. Those who are more or less familiar with our past and 
watch current affairs closely, will agree with me that all these 
centuries have been searching times. Friends, allies, and even 
protectors have been looked for. This is the fate of a small 
country and especially a country occupying a geopolitical 
situation like ours. The search is still going on and my 
personal decision that Georgia has had to unite -- joining the 
CIS is a continuation of this course, of this road, and of this 
history. 
  I am sure that future generations will analyze all this and 
will realize that this has been a necessary step to be taken, a 
word to be uttered. 
  What response should be given to those who say that this 
will 
not solve any problem, or that we have to look for a way for 
survival elsewhere, or this is a loss of sovereignty? I have 
already given a comprehensive answer to that but I will 
reiterate in general terms. 
  First of all, this is an opportunity to settle fundamental 
problems -- how efficiently this opportunity will be used 
depends on us as well as on our CIS partners. In the first 
instance I mean the economy. The economy will never revive, we 
will not reach our desired goals quickly without the CIS. The 
documents we have already signed and still have to sign create 
beneficial conditions for speeding up economic integration or 
rather for the restoration of what had already existed, what we 
should not have lost and what we should not have destroyed. But 
we destroyed it with our own hands and that is why our economy 
is frozen and on a very low level. 
  Apart from the economy, there are principles and guarantees 
for collective security, which will come to effect if not today, 
then tomorrow. This is very essential. 
  In my opinion, it is not serious to speak of the loss of 
sovereignty just because a part of the sovereignty is delegated 
to the Commonwealth. Georgia is not the only country in this 
situation. There are 12 countries in the European Union and 
they delegate even more rights to the union. Take the ASEAN, a 
brilliant union in the Pacific and Asia, which created a basis 
for the revival and prosperity of the once poor countries. A 
lot of rights are delegated there also. I can also bring 
examples of other regional unions. 
  There may be discussions, but you have to reckon with common 
ground rather than only your personal view, while aspiring to 
believe not to share grounds, and just stick stubbornly to what 
you consider the absolute truth. I would like to add that when 
a politician, and a serious politician at that, takes a 
decision, he is obliged to take into consideration current 
interests and we have to take into consideration interests of 
saving the country. 
  Today, we are facing the issue of the country's existence or 
non- existence and therefore you have to take a decision that 
provides the chance of survival. At the same time, a politician 
has to think of what will be essential tomorrow, what effects 
this present decision will have in five years' time, in 10 
years' time, in 20 years' time. 
  I would say that if the Commonwealth develops in the way all 
other regional and continental unions of the world have 
developed, I think our step can be justified from the future's 
point of view. If it does not develop in this way and it 
disintegrates, Georgia eventually will not lose anything. This 
is the case when we can gain a lot if the Commonwealth proves to 
be a real force and we can lose a lot and even everything if we 
do not join. 
  I would like to tell those who prompt us that Russia and the 
CIS are not a salvation and we have to look for other ways: Did 
we not look for other ways? Now, finally, my visit to the 
United States. Before that, there were my contacts with western, 
southern, eastern, northern countries. All ways have been 
tried. Some make our situation easier, some actively help us, 
but a principal way of survival and salvation has not yet been 
found. That is why, being guided by the existing situation, I 
have considered it essential to take a decision like this. I do 
not think I have made a mistake. 
  There are talks that Russia cannot be the survival [for 
Georgia]. Some say another way. We apparently had to sign an 
agreement with Russia but did not have to join the CIS. I do 
not think there is any logic in this. 
  First of all, it is absurd to ignore Russia, whatever 
forces come to power there. I believe that whoever argues over 
the issue on whether it is necessary to have relations with 
Russia, he is very far from reality and very far from politics. 
  If we agree that Russia is essential [for us], we would 
rather have relations with the Russia that is in the 
Commonwealth. For instance, do we prefer to be left 
face-to-face with a huge state like Russia or is it better to 
have a variant when we are in the CIS, and Russia is in the CIS, 
too? This means that bilateral relations are arranged and 
guaranteed and, at the same time, there are certain guarantees 
of security, collective security. I think this is also a more 
or less good reason. That is why I could not agree with 
arguments in parliament. Although, I have to say that there 
were sound ideas in certain speeches and I welcome them.

  [Text] Sochi, 7 March -- The Abkhazian Defense Ministry 
regards the actions of the Georgian military command as 
preparations for a new aggression. It issued a statement today 
which notes that, in the period from 24 February to 6 March, the 
Mkhedrioni and White Eagle military units, as well as armored 
vehicles and other weapons of the Georgian Army, were 
transferred from central Georgia to Zugdidskiy rayon. The 
statement says that the Georgian special services are continuing 
to send subversive and terrorist groups to the territory of the 
Republic of Abkhazia. 
  The Abkhaz side stresses that it will take the necessary 
measures appropriate to the actions of the enemy. All 
responsibility for the consequences rests with the Georgian 
side.

  [Text] Tbilisi March 7 TASS -- The Georgian Defence 
Ministry press service denied Abkhazian mass media reports on 
Monday that Georgia continues building up its military presence 
along the Inguri River and firing at Abkhazian positions in the 
Gali district. 
  The press service said that "Abkhazian and North Caucasian 
units continue to terrorize" civilians in the Gali and other 
districts of Abkhazia and carry out brazen raids on villages 
along the Inguri River. 
  Earlier today, the Abkhazian Defence Ministry accused 
Georgian military commanders of making preparations for a new 
aggression. 
  The Ministry said in a statement that between February 24 
and 
March 6 Georgian military commanders had moved paramilitary 
Mkhedrioni and White Eagle units and military hardware from 
central Georgia to the Zugdidi district. Meanwhile, Georgian 
secret services continue sending out saboteurs and terrorists to 
Abkhazia. 
  Abkhazia will take all necessary measures to give an 
adequate 
response to these activities. All responsibility for their 
possible consequences will rest with the Georgian side, the 
statement said.

  [Text] Tbilisi March 6 TASS--Preparations for upcoming 
parliamentary elections in western Georgia was in the focus of 
attention at today's enlarged meeting in Zugdidi of the 
temporary committee for state of emergency in western Georgia. 
  The meeting was attended by local government officials, 
representatives of some republican ministries and agencies, 
senior executives of the Georgian Cabinet of Ministers. 
  Speakers at the meeting pointed out that the Zugdidi, 
Tsalendzhikh and Chkhorotskus districts of western Georgia were 
ready for launching election campaign and holding elections. 
  When elections to the republican parliament took place last 
October, the Central Electoral Commission ruled to postpone the 
polls indefinitely in some regions of western Georgia because of 
a tense political situation. At the time, these regions were 
under control of armed formations supporting Georgia's late 
ousted President Zviad Gamsakhurdia. 
  Since then the situation in western Georgia has improved, 
which made it possible to fix a preliminary date of elections 
for July 12, 1994.

  [Text] We have been informed by Sakenergo [electric power 
production and consumption department] that electric power 
supply has increased compared with previous weeks. The 
operation of Tbilisi regional state power station has been 
relatively stable. Due to the rise of the water level in rivers, 
the efficiency of hydroelectric stations has increased almost by 
the factor of two and reached five million kilowatt/hours. 
Apart from this, the republic gets almost two million 
kilowatt/hours of electric power from Azerbaijan. Thus, as for 
today, the total power available reaches 18 million 
kilowatt/hours. The shortage is still large but it can be 
presumed that hydroelectric power stations will show a further 
significant increase in efficiency after 15 or 20 March.

Chukseyev] 
  [Text] Washington March 8 TASS -- The visiting Russian 
parliamentary delegation headed by Chairman of the State Duma 
Ivan Rybkin had a meeting with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State 
Strobe Talbott in Washington on Monday. 
  Informed sources told ITAR-TASS that the talks focused on 
the 
political situation in Russia. The American side displayed deep 
interest in how relations between the Russian president and 
parliament are being established. The State Duma chairman 
assured his interlocutor that notwithstanding all shades of 
factions in the parliament and differences, the striving for 
interaction with the president prevails among the legislators. 
  Such an interaction should be carried out in two key 
directions: the first one is to untangle the whole knot of 
economic problems of the country through a stable legislative 
basis meeting the present state of reforms and the second - to 
search for a broader consensus for national concord and 
reconciliation, the duma chairman said. 
  Rybkin emphasized that as far as he understands, reforms are 
not at all what was implied at an early stage of their 
implementation, when the mood of economic euphoria and 
romanticism were reigning. 
  Talbott agreed that now the time has come if not for making 
radical, then at least significant reappraisal of what is 
happening. Elections in Russia have given Washington a serious 
signal as to which direction reforms should proceed in, he said. 
According to him, as far as reforms are concerned the Duma is 
in constructive mood. 
  The U.S. deputy secretary of state emphasised that from 
Washington's point of view, Russia is now playing a positive 
role in resolving the Bosnian crisis. In his turn, Rybkin said 
that Russia gives top priority to cooperation with the United 
States, since in the contemporary world two countries just canot 
go without each other. 
  During the talks considerable attention was paid to 
prospects 
of cooperation with the CIS states. The American side in 
principle agrees that Russia is a stablilizing factor in this 
region and its peace efforts are for the time being not running 
counter to universally acceptable political standards and 
deserve Washington's support.

Chairman Ivan Rybkin in Washington on Monday, Foley said that 
U.S. lawmakers feel deep respect for the Russian Parliament

constitutional norms and are looking forward to active 
cooperation with it. He expressed the hope that the upcoming 
talks and meetings with members of the Russian delegation will 
give an impetus to inter-parliamentary cooperation.

  [Text] The Russo-American relations are not easy at the 
moment "because unnecessary difficulties spring up," Russian 
State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin said in Washington Monday [7 
March]. 
  Answering an Interfax question he said that he had discussed 
the consequences of the Ames' scandal with American 
intellectuals in the Russian embassy in Washington. 
  He had suggested that the Americans should agree to 
discussing the call made earlier by Yevgeniy Primakov, chief of 
the Russian Foreign Intelligence who wanted Moscow and 
Washington to "make each other's intelligences transparent to 
the other side." 
  Rybkin said that the Americans did not see much harm in the 
amnesty. "They share President Boris Yeltsin's and my view that 
if those who were released make trouble again they can be sent 
back to jail and the public opinion would say `That's where they 
belong'," he explained. 
  Rybkin told the journalists who accompanied him that he had 
agreed with the House of Representatives Speaker Thomas Foley 
that direct contacts would be established between the two 
parliaments. In particular, cooperation within the CSCE 
framework had been discussed. "A joint military organization 
could become a CSCE tool so that Russia should not be 
sidelined," he said. 
  Rybkin added that he and his U.S. counterpart had discussed 
ratification of START-2 and other international agreements by 
the Russian parliament and the situation in former Yugoslavia. 
He said that the crisis there could not be resolved unless 
Russia and the U.S.A. joined their efforts. 
  The House of Representatives speaker accepted the invitation 
to come to Russia on an official visit, Rybkin said. 
  On Monday Rybkin also met with Lee Hamilton, chairman of the 
foreign relations committee of the US Congress. 
  On the conclusion of this meeting he declared that it is 
necessary to implement several "non-popular measures" in Russia 
to pursue tough anti-inflation policy, civil peace and accord 
are necessary for this. 
  Rybkin referred to Gaydar who declared last September that 
as 
many as $20-25 Bn "leak" abroad annually. "One should 
undertake appropriate measures to return these funds and grant 
guarantees in order to draw foreign investments into the Russian 
economy. There is an appropriate majority to solve these issues 
in the State Duma," he said. 
  Rybkin criticized actions of the Central Bank for "wasteful 
allocation of technical credits" to Ukraine, Chechnya, Georgia, 
Belarus, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. "In absolute numbers the 
allocated sums exceeded credits being granted by the United 
States," he noted. 
  For his part, Lee Hamilton welcomed Rybkin's reassurances 
"about irreversibility of economic reforms in Russia." 
  At the same time he pointed out that there can appear "great 
difficulties" during the voting in the US Congress on allocation 
of an economic aid to Russia. "Officials in the United States 
are attentively following the Central Bank of Russia's activity 
and believe that it rouses hyperinflation," said Lee Hamilton.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Aleksandrov: "Russia Is Again Being Taught </F>
How To Live"] 
  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has made 
a statement in Congress which as so far failed to attract the 
attention in our country which it undoubtedly deserves. 
  The statement is about Russia and its relations with the 
countries of nearby foreign parts. Acknowledging that the 
concern expressed by Moscow over the position of the 25 million 
Russian-speaking citizens living outside Russia in the countries 
of the former Union should not be considered "unnatural," the 
secretary of state nonetheless made it extremely clear that 
concern is one thing but attempts to resolve effectively the 
many problems which the Russian-speaking population are 
encountering in the Baltic states, for instance, is something 
quite different. These attempts, it emerges from Christopher's 
statements, cannot be made except with the consent and even the 
authorization of international institutes and forums and best of 
all with the agreement of the United States itself. 
  There is no denying that what Moscow undertakes should, as 
Christopher notes, accord with the letter and spirit of 
international laws. But another of the secretary of state's 
important premises cannot fail to give rise to dispute and keen 
doubt: Even in those situations where a request is made to 
Moscow by those countries of the former Union "where Russian 
troops are deployed and the request is for help in safeguarding 
and preserving peace, Russia cannot respond unilateral to such 
requests but only in some kind of cooperation with the United 
Nations or, for instance, the CSCE," Christopher stated. 
Russians, the chief U.S. diplomat repeated, have the right to 
appeal to adjacent states "to be concerned for the position of 
Russian-speaking citizens and to display generosity with regard 
to them but the United States will resolutely oppose Moscow's 
adoption of any powerful steps in this direction." 
  A detail of some importance: Christopher made his statement 
in response to President Yeltsin's recent speech to Russian 
parliament. The speech spoke clearly enough of Russia's right 
to involve itself actively in the development of the situation 
in the former Union with a view to ensuring stability and the 
protection of Russians. The secretary of state commented with 
some scorn on these passages in the Russian president's speech, 
describing them as something aimed primarily at "a domestic 
audience." 
  This speech, Christopher reported, is still being studied in 
Washington but Washington is prepared to issue a warning right 
now to Moscow on how it should behave. In the most unequivocal 
terms. 
  In my view in the warnings which are now being heard from 
Washington it is easy to discern an attempt by the Clinton 
administration to preserve the status to which Russia has been 
reduced in recent years, particularly by virtue of the chaos, 
lack of thought, and often simply shortsightedness of our 
diplomats' actions. The status which Washington automatically 
guarantees Washington its own absolute superpowerdom on the 
world arena probably suits the United States completely. It can 
hardly suit Russia, nor should it. 
  Everything is the way it was before. Is that not so? 
  It seems to me that Foreign Minister Kozyrev should have a 
serious talk about this with Christopher when they meet 14 March 
in Vladivostok, where the secretary of state is going as part of 
his Far East tour.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Berezko report under "POSTSCRIPTUM: Events and </F>
Commentaries" rubric: "Prohibited Methods in Round 17, or Why 
Russian-Estonian Talks Are Deadlocked"] 
  [Text] It is regrettable to have to state this but it is 
true that the 17th round of Russo-Estonian talks did not prove 
satisfactory. This is primarily because, despite the Russian 
side's efforts, Estonia kept to its old positions on the problem 
of the situation of the Russian-speaking population in the 
country. This was stated at a news conference by special envoy 
Vasiliy Svirin, leader of the Russian state delegation at the 
talks with Estonia. 
  The Estonian side suddenly stated that Russia, to Estonia's 
surprise, intends to link the withdrawal of troops to the 
solution of problems of the social protection of military 
pensioners. Estonia believes that Russia is making "unheard-of 
demands relating to the social protection of military 
pensioners." 
  It turns out that by "unheard-of demands" Estonia means the 
elementary requirements of human rights which are unfailingly 
observed in any country which presumes to call itself civilized. 
Russia is insisting that the apartments inhabited by military 
pensioners have become their private property. In addition, it 
is the Russian side's opinion that military pensioners must be 
given a residence permit so as not be outcasts in a country 
where they have lived for decades. Estonia's demarche is is all 
the more surprising if you recall that at the 14th round of 
talks on 15 September 1993 J. Luik, leader of the Estonian 
Republic delegation, stated that "the articles and provisions of 
the draft agreement on the social protection of military 
pensioners and members of their families as agreed at 1 
September 1993 remain in force despite divergences with certain 
provisions of Estonia's law 'On aliens'." 
  Why has there been such a drastic change of direction in 
Estonian policy? The troop withdrawal treaty is ready for 
initialing, but Estonia clearly does not want to sign the 
agreement on the social protection of military pensioners and, I 
would venture to assert, made the said statement of consent 
merely to prompt Russia to withdraw the troops as quickly as 
possible. The Estonian diplomats' "cunning" tactic, more 
reminiscent of plain deceit, seems to be a continuation of 
Tallinn's "drift" into confrontation with Moscow, which is 
confirmed by Estonian President Lennart Meri's 25 February 
speech in Hamburg, where the Estonian head of state urged the 
West "not to trust Russia," which, he claimed, is "pursuing an 
imperial policy." 
  However, at the news conference given by the head of the 
Russian delegation it was stated that the troops will 
nevertheless be withdrawn from Estonian territory before 31 
August 1994 if the treaty on the withdrawal of the troops and 
the agreement on the social protection of military pensioners 
and members of their families are signed. "But unless we come 
to such an agreement," Vasiliy Svirin said, "Russia will decide 
the troop withdrawal timetable by itself"....

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy, leader of </F>
the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, by 24 CHASA Moscow 
correspondent Violeta Veselinova in Moscow; date not given: 
"NATO Should Be Eliminated, As It Is an Insignificant Bloc"] 
  [Text] Zhirinovskiy no longer wastes his time with 
journalists without getting money for it. He chases them away 
unless they pay in hard cash -- one minute with him costs a 
newspaper $100, and a television station -- $1,000. However, 
the politician who is now in the limelight made an exception for 
169 CHASA so as to show that he loves the Bulgarians, even 
though they have had no luck with their president. 
  [Veselinova] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, has the episode with Zhelev 
cooled your warm feelings toward the Bulgarians? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] What can you do? This is what the political 
struggle is like. Someone has whispered wrong things about me 
into your president's ear, and he immediately took such measures 
against me -- that is not nice! To expel the leader of the 
party that won the elections in friendly Russia! At one time in 
the past they expelled Georgi Dimitrov from Germany for alleged 
subversive activities, but to expel me from Bulgaria, which I 
love so much and which I was visiting as a private person.... 
This is how spies and smugglers are dealt with. I cannot 
comprehend how freedom of speech is being suppressed in a 
democratic country. They expel someone because he had allegedly 
said something that the president did not like. This is stupid. 
They say Prosecutor Nestor Nestorov wanted to take me to court 
because of my words. This again is something monstrous. Is it 
possible that Zhelev will expel everyone who has said something 
against him? Thousands of Bulgarians are dissatisfied with his 
rule! Will he banish all of them? Then he will be left in 
Sofia on his own, together with three police departments that 
will constantly repeat that he is a marvelous president. 
  At home in Russia, people shout "Down with Yeltsin!" every 
day, yet he does not expel anyone, neither Russians nor 
foreigners. I appealed through our embassy in Bulgaria against 
the ultimatum ordering me out of Bulgaria within 24 hours that 
your Interior Minister Viktor Mikhaylov signed, but I have not 
yet been told how far the matter has gone. Everyone whom I told 
how the Bulgarian president treated me has reacted with 
disapproval. Not only I, but Todor Zhivkov and the Moscow 
Communists also said that Bulgaria will be a Transdanubian 
province and a 16th republic [of the Russian Federation]. 
Bulgaria and Russia should help each other and they should live 
together in harmony. 
  [Veselinova] Why is your voice so hoarse? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] You journalists are to blame, you have 
shattered me with your interviews. Instead of gratitude for 
this, you scare the world by saying I am a fascist. How can I 
be a fascist when they murdered my uncle?! (He puts on the 
dress uniform jacket of a captain that he wore on Soviet Army 
Day.) See, now I am in the uniform of an officer of the Soviet 
Army that fought against fascism. (He chases away some BBC 
journalists.) Why should I talk to you? You do not pay 
anything. I will allow some time for German journalists, 
because they paid me $30,000 in cash. (Yeltsin rings him on the 
telephone.) 
  Russia has always been hedged round with enemies. (Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy roams over a map of the world using a pen light. 
This is a miniature version of the terrible "Elipton" weapon 
with which the chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party is 
frightening the world. The ballpoint-pen-like instrument has 
three buttons. If you press the first button, the laser beam 
acts as a pointer. If you point the second, the other person 
will collapse unconscious on the floor within three seconds. If 
you press the third button, you can remove your target from the 
land of the living.) Our enemies are everywhere, all around us 
there are enemies, enemies.... We have been at war for 90 
years. Our nation's self-confidence is due to our strong army. 
We have states around us that lay claim to parts of our 
territory. Finland wants Karelia, the Germans want Kaliningrad, 
the Poles dream about Lviv, the Romanians want Chisinau, China 
-- our Far East, Japan -- the Kuril Islands.... As for our 
friends the Arabs -- Iraq, Syria, the Turks are the most 
impudent -- they insist on taking the whole of the Caucasus, 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and all the land as far as 
the Altay. You see what impudence this is? Look where 
Kazakhstan is. What is the result? It is that I was born 
abroad. Perestroyka ruined everything. 
  [Veselinova] According to Nostradamus, world war III is 
supposed to start any moment. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] There will be no war, never fear. However, 
the West must take heed of our desires, and we will allow them 
to keep their existing borders. We have no intention of moving 
toward the West. The south is what concerns us; here is where 
the war is. We are only interested in Turkey, Iran, and 
Afghanistan. The Germans should not oppose us, because they too 
are troubled by the Turks. If a different situation is created 
in the south regarding Turkey, this will be to Germany's benefit 
as well. We are ready to improve our relations with the 
Germans. Why not restore the Berlin-Warsaw-Minsk-Moscow axis? 
The Poles already have specific proposals in this context. 
Then, later on, we can extend this axis to the Far East. The 
Japanese would approve of this idea, they would even invest 
money in it. How do they transport their goods now? They make 
a circuit of the globe. (He draws a circle on the map with his 
pen light.) It will be more beneficial for them if there is a 
route to the Far East across our territory, and Russia will 
receive money from the route passing through its territory. 
  [Veselinova] Are you afraid that NATO will stand behind 
Turkey? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] You are mistaken if you believe that the 
Turks are invulnerable because they are members of NATO. NATO 
is a weak bloc. The states that are members of NATO have never 
fought a war, except for Germany, and it does not want to fight. 
Who will fight if they have to? The Danes? The Norwegians? 
The French? The Italians? We, on the other hand, have fought 
the Turks 30 times and beaten them every time. We have no 
worthy opponents anywhere in the world. NATO is an 
insignificant bloc, and it should be eliminated. The same goes 
for the United Nations. 
  However, Russia is a peaceful country. We will not attack, 
but we will defend ourselves if necessary. We prefer to win by 
economic means instead of military ones. Anyone who imagines 
that Russia is economically weak is making a serious mistake. 
Russia has always been strong. Now it is simply sick -- states 
fall sick just like people. However, Russia got over its 
illness on 12 December 1993. Now we intend to pull ourselves 
upwards by our bootstraps. In two or three years everything 
will be OK with us, whereas in Germany, for example, the 
situation will worsen. The rabble that has flooded in -- Turks, 
Arabs, Gypsies, Romanians, the whole mafia of Eastern Europe -- 
will all settle there. If the Germans ask for help when things 
get really bad for them, then we will come running. 
  The wars will continue in the world without us. We will sit 
and wait; we will not meddle in the conflicts. Russia issues no 
orders to anyone. We merely state our position. However, we do 
not permit anyone to interfere in our own affairs, as we do not 
interfere in the affairs of Spain, let us say. They have their 
Basques and Catalans -- let the Spaniards themselves decide what 
to do with them. Nor do we stick our noses in Britain's 
troubles, despite the fact that Ireland has been drowning in 
blood for 25 years now. Why, then, should they interfere in the 
Slavs' problems? 
  [Veselinova] How did you scare NATO into not dropping bombs 
on Sarajevo? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] It is true that the people in NATO were very 
frightened. Russia's intervention happened mainly because of 
the influence of our faction in parliament. When I was in 
Bulgaria and Serbia, I told the journalists that if the NATO 
pilots dare to bomb Serbian towns, this will mean a declaration 
of war on Russia. If French pilots drop bombs, this will mean 
war between France and Russia, and if German pilots do so, it 
will mean war between Germany and Russia. My words had a 
sobering effect on NATO. You saw that no war started. This 
means I am right that NATO should dissolve itself. The United 
Nations has also become outdated. We must form a new 
organization -- a League of European States. Why do we 
Europeans need an international organization like the United 
Nations? It is a collection of states from the age of the ox 
cart. Africa, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia 
-- why should I be interested in their problems? They are at 
the other end of the earth. The League should be formed between 
Western and Eastern Europe. Let us solve our own problems and 
leave them to solve theirs! 
  The Bosnian conflict is an example of the effectiveness of 
the old principle of divide and rule. In three years, 
Yugoslavia has been brought to its knees. The foreign 
businessmen -- the Italians, French, and Germans -- have an 
interest in ruining Yugoslavia's economy, just as they have in 
ruining Bulgaria's. Then their goods will be bought up, because 
no others will be available, and the enterprises of Serbia and 
Bulgaria will go bankrupt. This is a war of the markets. 
  [Veselinova] Why is the world supporting the Muslims in this 
conflict? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] This is the nub of the problem, that the 
Muslim card is being played again. They allege that the 
Orthodox Serbs are terrorizing the Catholics and the Muslims. 
The Serbs are the most numerous. If they are destroyed or 
scattered over the Balkans, there will be no one left to resist. 
  For five centuries the Ottoman Empire oppressed the Balkan 
Slavs. Now the Turks are not only living on Bulgarian territory, 
engaging in trade, and owning Turkish enterprises, but on top of 
everything they are even creeping into parliament. It is to the 
West's benefit to let the Slavs and Turks squabble among 
themselves. It is high time the Slavs ceased being the object 
of attacks. To save the Bulgarians from the Turks, they should 
form an alliance with Russia. We are ready to send a division to 
the Bulgarian-Turkish border. Bulgaria should not sell its land 
to the Turks. It is better for Russian enterprises to purchase 
this land, in return for settlement of debts. Southern Bulgaria 
is a vacation zone. The miners of the Donbass will like it. 
  [Veselinova] Demirel is not very fond of you. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I do not burn with love for him either, but 
what is to be done? It is impossible for all the leaders of 
parties and states to feel sympathy for one another. 
  [Veselinova] Why did the Austrian prostitute publish such 
disgusting lies about you? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I saw the article, it was published in a 
German journal. Now I will sue this woman. I demand damages of 
$100,000. The whole thing is a pack of lies. The lawsuit is in 
progress in Germany. The aim was to undermine my reputation, to 
blacken my name. Look, I spent two days in Sveti Vrach, and the 
Bulgarian newspapers printed nothing compromising about me. The 
Bulgarians are my friends. We only spent one evening in Vienna. 
However, their intelligence service is powerful and still 
operates. They certainly forced this girl to give an interview, 
even though I have never set eyes on her. There is nothing 
strange in the fact that they bribed her. In Bulgaria the 
intelligence service has been abolished -- there is no one to 
organize provocations against me, although no one in your 
country is trying to throw any dirt at me. I found out that some 
party gave 20 German marks each to the Turks who catcalled me at 
the Memorial to the Tsar Liberator. However, we are well 
practiced in using camcords and cameras, and now we have 
photographs of all the participants in this paid demonstration. 
  [Veselinova] How is your party financed? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] The electors finance it. If each of our 
voters donates 1,000 rubles -- the price of two packs of 
cigarettes -- we will receive 12 billion. Our party has 
already bought many buildings in Moscow. These will house the 
offices and clubs of the Liberal Democratic Party. 
  [Veselinova] You are more interesting to the world than any 
Hollywood star. Are you paid for your performance? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I have introduced a tariff so that people 
leave me in peace -- I am already extremely tired. If anyone 
cannot pay to talk to me, let him go on his way! A minute's 
conversation with me costs a newspaper $100, while a television 
station has to pay $1,000. 
  [Veselinova] How does your wife react to the fact that you 
are always busy? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Badly. I very seldom show up at home. She 
is naturally unhappy about it. We quarrel. I see my son once a 
week. 
  [Veselinova] Is Yeltsin afraid of you? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I do not insist that he should vacate the 
president's office immediately. There is still time before the 
elections. Yeltsin loves to give orders. Maybe he sometimes 
makes mistakes -- that is only human. However, he is what he 
is. Gorbachev, on the other hand, promised to improve life, and 
look at what a mess he made of the country. He ruined 
everything and then ran away, the coward. He is now counting 
the dollars that he has been given for a job well done. 
  [Veselinova] Why did you not meet Clinton when he was in 
Moscow? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] He asked for a meeting, but I refused, 
because the invitation was addressed to the Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia. It should have been addressed to me personally 
-- to Liberal Democratic Party Chairman Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. 
If I were to send him an invitation, I would address it "to 
U.S. President Bill Clinton," not to the party that nominated 
him. 
  However, the chance of Clinton and me meeting has not been 
lost. My adviser will soon fly to the United States and arrange 
this in March or April. We will play golf and go to a ranch. 
We will have a rest and get to know each other better. After 
the United States I will probably visit Canada, Australia, and 
New Zealand. 
  [Veselinova] What is this "Elipton" weapon? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] It is my personal weapon. I completely 
destroys buildings and people, not by fire, but with a laser 
beam that destroys all targets. 
  [Veselinova] Can you destroy the world with this weapon? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Of course I can, but I do not want to. It is 
important that we possess such a weapon. If any danger 
threatens us, in the case of extreme necessity there is nothing 
strange about us using it in certain regions -- for defense.

<F P=106> [Interview with R. Karadzic by Vasiliy Fartyshev in Moscow, </F>
date not given: "Radovan Karadzic: `We Were Merely the First 
Line of Defense'"] 
  [Text] There was a meeting at the Russian Federation 
Writers' Union between the leaders of the writers' organization 
and Moscow writers and Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian 
Serbs and vice president of the Union of Serbian Writers. 
  In a cordial and fraternal atmosphere poets and writers from 
Russia and Serbia talked about the historical ties of friendship 
and kinship between the two Slavic cultures and the problems 
facing our peoples today. The Yugoslav colleagues noted the 
great contribution Russian writers and the general public have 
made to settling the armed conflict and to the success of the 
joint opposition to the West's expansionist policy directed 
against the sovereign republic. 
  Our correspondent asked politician, poet, and doctor Radovan 
Karadzic to answer a few PRAVDA questions. 
  [Fartyshev] Comrade Karadzic, what is your opinion of 
Russia's recent initiative on settling the conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Karadzic] We are uncommonly heartened and grateful for all 
that Russia has done for Serbia. Many attempts are being made 
in the world today to resolve the Yugoslav problem without the 
participation of an entire people, and it is perhaps the 
grimmest period in Serbian history. During World War II we 
learned first-hand what genocide means: The Hitlerites 
destroyed 700,000 Serbs as well as a large number of Jews and 
gypsies. We have failed to preserve a unified Yugoslavia as a 
state, but we are making every effort to uphold the independence 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is why throughout the 22 months 
of the war we have been defending our territory and our people, 
in order to prevent further, "civilized" genocide. We have 
created and formalized our own Serbian Republic, and a treaty on 
this will be ratified in the very near future. 
  The Russian action helped overcome confrontation with NATO, 
and, as a result of this, I believe Russia emerged in the world 
political arena as an independent force to be reckoned with. 
  [Fartyshev] Many of my colleagues who have been in 
Yugoslavia when battles have been raging have said that the 
Serbs were bewildered by Russia's long "silence" and were 
accusing us of inaction. Tell me, in the minds of your ordinary 
citizens are the Kremlin and Russia synonymous? 
  [Karadzic] No, we see a difference between Kremlin 
officialdom and the Russian people, who have had truly fraternal 
feelings for us Slavs for centuries. I am sure that ordinary 
people are well aware of the difference. "If the Serbs cannot 
be destroyed, let's befriend them" -- that is more or less the 
metamorphosis that has occurred in the case of your Foreign 
Ministry. 
  [Fartyshev] Tell me, did you ask Russia for aid -- two years 
ago or after that? 
  [Karadzic] No, we did not ask for aid. But I admit that we 
were hoping to get it. And it came. 
  Incidentally, I must say that Russian writers and their 
protests and solidarity with us had a big influence on your 
government. 
  [Fartyshev] Radovan, you are a well-known poet. Just before 
this war you were presented with a prize for making a major 
contribution to the development of Yugoslav children's poetry. 
How do you manage to combine politics and poetry? 
  [Karadzic] When Yugoslavia was torn apart we writers were 
forced to become politicians. Now most writers in my country 
are politicians, and they have done a very great deal to defend 
the Serbian people and their sovereignty. We have always 
studied the classics of Russian literature, without which there 
would be no world literature. In the same way, without Russian 
politics there can be no world politics. 
  As a poet I am very grateful to a number of Russian 
publications for publishing my poetry at what is a most 
difficult time for my country. 
  [Fartyshev] There was one particular phrase that struck me 
in Dostoyevskiy's "Diaries" -- to the effect that the time would 
come when the southern Slavs would "set us an example." What do 
you think he meant? 
  [Karadzic] As I see it, what he meant was that we, the 
southern Slavs, live on the border between East and West. In 
the present war Yugoslavia was merely the first line of defense 
for Slavdom and Orthodox culture in general. This war was a 
dress rehearsal for what lay in store for Russia. A veritable 
blitzkrieg was mounted against us. The West, NATO, and Germany 
were planning to deal with Yugoslavia in two months. But they 
did not manage it even in two years. Next in their plans was 
Albania, and then the dirct route to Russia. But we are not 
talking, of course, about outright aggression, no, the main task 
is to split peoples, make them quarrel among themselves, make 
Russia small. Never let yourself be divided -- that is one of 
the lessons of our war. 
  Take Ethiopia, another Orthodox country. It lost Eritrea, 
and with it access to the sea. And no one in the world 
interceded on its behalf. The same might have happened to us, 
had not great Russia interceded on Orthodox, Slavic, fraternal 
Serbia's behalf. 
  [Fartyshev] Tell me, has the war ended or is this just a 
pause? 
  [Karadzic] I would like to believe that the war will end 
soon. And we will create a new border between East and West, so 
that there are no more intrigues against the Slavic world. 
  [Fartyshev] Are the intrigues still going on? 
  [Karadzic] I heard a speech by Zbigniew Brzezinski recently. 
He always talked with great passion about the fight against 
Bolshevism. There is no Bolshevism now, but he is just as 
vicious when he talks about the fight against Russia. I 
realized that it is not actually a matter of communist ideology 
-- Brzezinski and dozens of special institutes in the West have 
been fighting and will continue to fight against the USSR, 
Russia, and the Russian people.

  [Text] Turkmenistan has increased its daily gas supplies to 
Georgia from 8 Mn to 9.5 Mn cubic meters, the Gruzgas Department 
told INTERFAX. 
  This is due to the recently reached agreement between the 
two 
countries' leaders. Turkmenistan has also agreed to a deferment 
in the payment of the Georgian $150 Mn debt. 
  Meanwhile, the production of electricity by the Georgian 
hydro-power plants has almost doubled due to a rise in the river 
levels. Georgia generates 16 Mn kilowatt hours of electricity 
daily. Another 2 Mn kilowatt hours arrive daily from Azerbaijan. 
  The Georgian hydro-power plants are expected to start 
working 
at full load in the second half of March, which will put most of 
the local enterprises back into operation.

begin in the Republic this year. The first new passports were 
issued to government members on the eve of the Turkmenbashi's 
birthday. The passport for a citizen of Turkmenistan, like the 
state flag, is green, and the cover portrays the country's coat 
of arms. It is much larger than the old Soviet passport, 
containing 32 pages. All entries are made in three languages -- 
Turkmen (in the Latin alphabet), Russian, and English. With the 
introduction of the new passport, the need to issue foreign 
travel passports lapses.

  [Text] The chairman of Tajikistan's parliament, Emomali 
Rakhmanov, has requested the U.N. Security Council to consider 
the possibility of granting the collective CIS peace-keeping 
forces formed last autumn and still deployed in Tajikistan the 
status of U.N. peace-keeping forces. 
  In his messages sent on Saturday to the chairman of the U.N. 
Security Council, Jean-Bernard Merimee, and to the U.N. 
Secretary-General, Butrus-Butrus Ghali, Rakhmanov expressed 
concern over the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border, where 
"armed units of the Tajik opposition backed by some groups of 
Afghan mujaheddin continue to stage acts of terrorism and 
sabotage." 
  The Government of Tajikistan "intends to firmly follow its 
program for settling the conflict between different political 
forces in Tajikistan peacefully and resolving the situation on 
the Tajik-Afghan border by political means," Rakhmanov assured 
members of the U.N. Security Council. 
  In this connection the Tajik leadership intends to enter 
into 
talks with spokesmen for the opposition in Moscow this month, 
the messages said.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Kuzmin] </F>
  [Text] Tehran, 7 Mar TASS -- At Sunday's meeting with 
Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin, Tajik 
Moslem and nationalist opposition leaders agreed to open direct 
talks with the Tajik Government with the participation of 
mediators. The opposition delegation to the talks is expected 
to respond to Russia's offer to hold the first round of talks in 
Moscow, Adamishin told TASS. He reported that his visit to Iran 
aimed to negotiate a political settlement of the Tajik conflict. 
  Tajikistan has been in turmoil since independence after the 
Soviet Union's collapse in 1991. 
  Adamishin, whose government has thousands of troops in 
Tajikistan guarding its southern border with Afghanistan against 
Moslem rebels based here, told Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali 
Akbar Velayati that Moscow was not seeking a military solution. 
  He stressed Tajik opposition had come to understanding there 
was no alternative to a political solution of the problem. 
According to the Russian diplomat, the main thing now is to 
open talks. To get this process moving, Russia suggested that 
the confronting sides enter dialogue on March 16 and pledged 
safety for both parties to the talks. 
  According to Adamishin, the programmes of settlement set 
forth by the sides differ considerably, but the negotiating 
process is designed to draw them closer. 
  The deputy foreign minister stressed that nobody but Tajiks 
themselves could settle their problems. For this reason, Russia 
thinks participation of any third countries in the talks to be 
unnecessary. U.N. mediation will be quite enough.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva and </F>
Aleksandr Kharchenko] 
  [Text] Dushanbe, 4 Mar TASS -- Head of the U.N. mission of 
observers in Tajikistan, Liviu Bota, positively estimated the 
aspiration of official Dushanbe towards a political dialogue 
with the opposition and spoke for acceleration of this process. 
The high-ranking representative of the United Nations believes 
that the negotiating process is a concrete step towards peace, 
national reconciliation and stability in the Republic. 
  Liviu bota stated this today in an interview with ITAR-TASS 
commenting on the latest initiatives of the Tajik authorities in 
establishing contacts with representatives of oppositional 
circles of different political orientation. In this connection 
the head of the U.N. mission of observers noted that this 
international organization was prepared to render feasible aid 
in arranging these negotiations. 
  Ramiro Peres Ballon, U.N. secretary-general's special envoy 
currently staying in Tajikistan, agreed to participate in this 
process. In reply to a question by ITAR-TASS correspondent if 
the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border under conditions of 
continuous armed provocations there, may affect the negotiating 
process, the U.N. representative said that, in his opinion, 
clashes on the border are not of a mass character and was 
skeptical about the possibility of large-scale operations there. 
However, he stressed that at the moment of the talks all combat 
actions and other negative incidents on the frontier should be 
ceased. 
  Assessing the present social and political situation in 
Tajikistan, Liviu Bota noted that over the last year on the 
whole it certainly has changed for the better, become much 
quieter, although not everywhere, he admitted. 
  Specifying his thought, Liviu Bota explained that there were 
separate facts of violations of human rights in Tajikistan, as 
well as infringement of security guarantees for Tajik refugees 
returning from Afghanistan. 
  According to the head of the U.N. mission, this is not the 
policy of the government. In the conditions of Tajikistan, he 
noted, when as a result of the recent civil war many people lost 
their relatives, a factor of revenge is acting. This should not 
be disregarded, Liviu bota explained, although the United 
Nations categorically condemns each such fact and informs the 
Tajik leadership about them. 
  At the same time the U.N. official said that he would like 
to 
emphasise that the government naturally is responsible for 
everything which is going on in its republic including such a 
sphere as the observance of human rights. It is very important 
the U.N. mission of observers meets with understanding in this 
issue on the part of the Tajik leadership, Liviu Bota stated.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Galina Gridneva and </F>
Aleksandr Kharchenko] 
  [Text] Dushanbe, 4 Mar TASS -- Major-General Anatoliy 
Kuptsov, first deputy security minister of Tajikistan, called 
"unfounded and not being in accord with reality" the latest 
rumors about allegedly a complex social and political situation 
in the former Kurgan-Tyube region and mass conflicts on clan and 
inter-ethnic grounds, which led to numerous victims. 
  The situation in Kurgan-Tyube and the neighboring districts 
remains calm and there are no trends for its deterioration, the 
major-general told ITAR-TASS today stressing that certain forces 
stop at nothing, including spreading various rumors, in an 
attempt to destabilize the situation. 
  According to Anatoliy Kuptsov, several tragic incidents 
really occurred in these inhabited localities in the second half 
of February this year. For instance, unidentified persons 
provoked shooting on the territory of the Sangak Safarov 
collective farm in the Bokhtar district. As a result, one of 
the officers of a military unit of the Tajikistan Defense 
Ministry stationed in Kurgan-Tyube, and three civilians were 
killed. 
  Unidentified bandits also killed a resident of the Bokhtar 
district who worked in a local branch of the international 
non-governmental organization "Physicians Beyond Borders". 
  Three people in a car driving from the frontier center of 
Pyandzh to Dushanbe came under fire and were killed. Competent 
bodies are carefully investigating each criminal case, the first 
deputy minister noted. 
  But already now it is possible to say that all three 
incidents are not of a clan or an inter-ethnic nature. They are 
purely criminal cases. 
  It is no secret, the general said, that the general crime 
situation in the Republic is very tense, including the former 
Kurgan-Tyube region. There are several reasons for the outburst 
of criminal actions, one of them being the consequences of the 
recent civil war, violations of legal laws, as well as the 
availability of large quantities of firearms, which the local 
inhabitants still possess despite measures taken by the "power" 
structures of the Republic.

<F P=106> [V. Klimov report on interview with Vladimir Rubanov, deputy </F>
secretary of the Security Council; place and date not given: 
"How Much Does Law and Order Cost? The Security Council Has 
Examined the Federal Program for Intensifying the Fight Against 
Crime"] 
  [Text] Something which has been discussed many times in 
the mass media, and has always -- especially recently -- 
provoked heightened interest, has come to pass. Yesterday the 
Russian Federation Federal Program for Intensifying the Fight 
Against Crime for 1994-1995 was examined in the country's 
Security Council and, after criticisms had been taken into 
account, was recommended to be sent for ratification by the 
Russian Federation president. 
  The draft program is a Morocco-bound book comprising 84 
pages. Not many, one might think, but it is the quintessence of 
the colossal labor of many people. The book is divided into two 
parts. The first part examines today's requirements, the second 
examines long-term prospects. Everything is terse and 
absolutely clear: Urgent measures for intensifying the fight 
against crime are denoted, and the specific officials charged 
with implementing them are defined. 
  What is the essence of the federal program? What does it 
promise for Russians in the future? How did work on it proceed? 
Our observer Vladimir Klimov turned to Vladimir Arsentyevich 
Rubanov, deputy secretary of the Security Council, for answers 
to these questions. 
  [Rubanov] The program enables efforts to be concentrated in 
terms of time, place, and purpose. The legislator works in 
harness with law-enforcement organs, and they in turn work with 
social security organs, and so forth. The concentration of 
efforts presupposes a programmatic conception of the problem and 
the coordination of the actions of all elements of state power 
in the name of common goals. 
  The cornerstone of the federal program is the formulation of 
priority normative acts and guidelines for law-giving activity 
aimed at lowering the level of crime and increasing the 
protection of the individual in general. But it is not enough 
to prepare the necessary legislative acts; it is also necessary 
to define clear mechanisms for their implementation and 
interaction. The first section of both parts of the program 
deals with this. 
  The second part deals with crime prevention. It is important 
not only to detect crime and punish the culprits, but also to 
prevent it in good time. 
  The priority measures projected in the federal program will 
enable us to increase society's protection against criminal 
infringements and to protect the individual from crime. 
  Later in the program are two sections formulated for the 
sphere of specific actions. These include the fight against 
crimes against the individual, economic crime, and organized and 
gangland crime. It is necessary to dwell on the latter forms of 
crime in particular. For a considerable number of citizens 
crime has now become their major profession, and the level of 
organization among criminal formations is increasing. Whole 
criminal structures are being formed which are capable of 
1nfluencing political and economic life in individual regions of 
Russia and in the country as a whole. Crime has become 
international. It is already spreading from Russia to remote 
foreign parts. 
  But the nearby foreign parts are a separate question. We 
have too many links with the CIS countries. Apart from anything 
else, we still, unfortunately, have in effect a single criminal 
area. But now state mechanisms have been delineated. In this 
connection questions of interstate organizational collaboration 
between the CIS countries in this sphere are a priority. Common 
organizational and legal principles and specific interstate 
treaties are essential. 
  In point of fact, this is why the program has appeared, 
because new problems cannot be resolved in the framework of the 
old relations and the mechanisms through which they were 
conducted. 
  Many people worked on the compilation of the program. But 
above all I would like to note the work of the Security 
Council's Interdepartmental Commission for Combating Crime and 
Corruption, which is headed by Minister of Justice Yuriy 
Khamzatovich Kalmykov. This commission will in fact most likely 
become the coordinating organ for the implementation of the 
program. Representatives of about 20 departments sit on this 
commission. 
  The federal program was directly prepared and written by a 
group of 36 people. They are well-known academics, lawyers, 
executives, and economists. The program went through three 
stages of coordination with ministries and departments. It was 
subjected to expert study by eminent specialists. One of these 
was lawyer and academician Vladimir Nikolayevich Kurdryavtsev. 
  Following the expert studies many criticisms were, as a 
rule, 
submitted to us. In all somewhere in the order of 1,500 were 
examined. The criticisms were taken into account in the final 
version of the draft program. As a result the document was not 
only professionally prepared, as was noted at the last session 
chaired by the secretary of the Security Council, but was also 
highly politically coordinated. 
  The program was six months in preparation. Activity on the 
work was stepped up in late 1993. The contribution made by 
specialists of the sector for supporting the activity of the 
Security Council's Interdepartmental Commission was especially 
great. This sector is headed by Anatoliy Pavlovich Korotkov. 
  All three versions of the program were precisely costed; 
after all, a program without resource backing is simply a 
slogan. The initial version was a wish list. It cost 16 
trillion rubles [R], which was clearly unrealistic. It was 
necessary to lower our sights. The second version cost 
somewhere in the order of R10 trillion. This sum also proved to 
be out of the reach of the budget. In connection with this a 
dispute arose in the Interdepartmental Commission between the 
leaders of the law-enforcement departments and the financiers. 
Law-enforcement officials stated that they did not want to 
deceive society by projecting goals which were unattainable 
without resource backing. If we want to change the situation, 
the corresponding impact can be achieved only with additional 
investments. 
  However, even in these disputes everyone understood that, 
given the rigid economy drive, it was necessary to decrease 
expenditure. The final version of the program was also 
thoroughly costed. It was reduced by almost half. However, it 
was decided at the Security Council session to carry out a 
further estimate in order finally to determine the level of 
funding. 
  These funds have been distributed to the structures which 
are 
directly engaged in fighting crime. More than one-third is 
going to increase the cadres of the law-enforcement organs. We 
are a long way behind in information support, and a considerable 
proportion of the funds allocated will be spent on this. The 
rest will be spent on supplying weapons and special equipment, 
building premises for law and order organs, and other basic 
necessities. 
  An unreasonable desire to economize in the fight against 
crime would mean us losing more than we gain. After all, in the 
law-enforcement spheres we count only the cost, disregarding the 
economic and social benefit. I will not go into all the finer 
details; I will say only that, according to the methods which 
are accepted in world practice and recommended by the United 
Nations, the benefit of law-enforcement measures is bound to 
exceed the cost by roughly twofold. 
  That is talking money. But what figures do you use to assess 
the following fact: According to the forecasts of a Ministry of 
Internal Affairs scientific research institute, intensifying the 
fight against crimes against the individual will enable the 
lives of 20,000 Russian citizens to be saved. 
  The Federal Program for Intensifying the Fight Against Crime 
has been examined on a working basis several times already. 
Almost all questions have been removed. The Security Council 
has expressed an on the whole positive attitude to the program 
and ordered it to be finalized within one week, taking account 
of the criticisms made in the Security Council, and then to be 
submitted for the president's approval. The government has been 
instructed to provide the funding for the program.

<F P=106> [Interview with GLASNOST Chief Editor Yuriy Izyumov by </F>
Viktor Kozhemyako; place and date not given: "GLASNOST Once 
More Has a Voice. Conversation With Political Weekly's Chief 
Editor"] 
  [Text] We have already reported that the political weekly 
GLASNOST has begun publishing once again after a gap of several 
months. At the request of readers, I met with Chief Editor 
Yuriy Izyumov and asked him a number of questions. 
  [Kozhemyako] Yuriy Petrovich, not everyone is aware of what 
happened to your newspaper. Why were readers deprived of it for 
so long? 
  [Izyumov] GLASNOST, along with PRAVDA, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, 
and other opposition publications, was banned by order of the 
Russian Ministry of the Press and Information on that fateful 4 
October last year. Moreover, that same day people burst into 
the editorial office armed with sections of steel pipe and other 
equipment. The place was ransacked. Then, on the instructions 
of the presidential administration, the journalists were robbed 
of the building that we had legally occupied since the day the 
newspaper was founded. I filed charges with the People's Court 
in Moscow's Sverdlovskiy Rayon protesting flagrant tyranny. 
  The case has finally has been examined. The court found the 
Ministry of Press and Information order banning the weekly 
unlawful and overturned it. The newspaper is with us again! 
  [Kozhemyako] How do you define your present stance in the 
multifaceted world of newspapers? What guides you in shaping 
your course? 
  [Izyumov] We are still a communist newspaper. We have close 
links with the Union of Communist Parties-CPSU and will, as far 
as we are able, promote the restoration of the CPSU as a unified 
Communist Party and the USSR as a unified state. We are 
convinced that the USSR cannot be restored without the 
restoration of a unified Communist Party. The sooner all 
communists join forces, the faster such vital tasks for all the 
peoples as the cessation of fratricidal wars and the restoration 
of Soviet power will be accomplished. 
  [Kozhemyako] How do you see the weekly taking shape as a 
unionwide newspaper? 
  [Izyumov] No borders and customs houses can prevent us from 
writing about the life of working people and pressing problems 
throughout the territory of the Soviet Union. We are trying and 
will continue trying to provide articles from every republic in 
each edition and tell the truth about what is going on there. 
It is important to help people grasp the political hurly-burly 
around them. To this end we will talk about the nature of 
various parties, political associations, major firms, and banks. 
Whereas others paint some as angels and others as devils, we 
plan to publish objective portraits of the best-known figures 
from all the republics. 
  [Kozhemyako] What can you say about your political 
opponents' attitude to the weekly? 
  [Izyumov] Our motto is only to tell the truth about 
everything, whether anyone likes it or not. To our great regret 
virtually no one likes the truth. That is why we have so many 
enemies among our political opponents. Regrettably, we are 
experiencing some animosity from some of our comrades in arms. 
Their long CPSU membership has not taught them to respond 
correctly to criticism. 
  [Kozhemyako] What difficulties is the editorial office 
experiencing? 
  [Izyumov] There are certainly many difficulties. We are 
glad that despite all the ordeals, the material hardship, and 
the severe repressive pressure the editorial collective has 
survived and even grown stronger -- as a collective of 
like-minded people working not so much for their pay as for a 
noble idea. But our money problems are extremely acute. In 
addition, subscription has been wrecked and the distribution 
system disrupted. During the four-month ban the editorial 
office lost all its financial income and its bank account was 
seized. That is why GLASNOST asks communists and all the 
newspaper's friends to: 
  -- collect donations to enable us to continue publishing the 
newspaper; 
  -- organize circulation of GLASNOST via party 
organizations; 
  -- promptly convey urgent information to the editorial 
office. 
  Our mailing address is: GLASNOST Editorial Office, 14 New 
Square, Moscow 103132. Telephone: 231-47-18.

<F P=106> [Sergey Chugayev article: "Unity of President and Premier </F>
Promises Russia a Temporary Period of Internal Political 
Stability"] 
  [Text] It was only to be expected that the prime 
minister's speech at the enlarged session of the Russian 
Government would not satisfy everyone. Indeed, it showed that 
the government does not have an integrated economic policy. And 
it cannot have. It is impossible to find anything like the 
present situation either around the world or in Russian history. 
The reserves have been exhausted, and the only way out is to 
maneuver between inflation economic collapse. No 
miracle-working prescriptions for salvation exist. This, in 
fact, can be considered the chief topic of V. Chernomyrdin's 
speech. So it only remains to surmise how skillfully the 
government will succeed in executing this maneuver. 
  Meanwhile it seems that the political consequences of what 
happened in the Kremlin 4 March lend themselves to a more exact 
prognosis. Given the president's overall strategic supremacy, 
the monolithic union which the president and the premier 
displayed at the session and the clear demarcation of 
responsibilities between them -- B. Yeltsin assumes full control 
of the military-political bloc, leaving economic problems to 
Chernomyrdin -- give grounds for concluding that the executive 
in Russia is probably as strong and united as it has ever been 
since the end of 1991. This circumstance gives Russia the 
opportunity to enter a period of internal political stability, 
albeit a temporary one. 
  It seems obvious that, despite its many shortcomings, the 
new 
Russian Constitution today plays a positive role as the main 
stabilizing factor. The predominance of the president's 
constitutional rights enables him, having a loyal government, to 
neutralize the danger stemming from the opposition concentrated 
in the lower chamber of parliament. This is also convincingly 
proved by the story of the development of the mini-crisis 
connected with the Duma's political amnesty decision. 
  By letting the Lefortovo prisoners go free, the Duma has 
essentially let off the opposition's steam. No more effective 
results have been achieved. In the situation which has taken 
shape since then none of the Duma factions is interested in 
finding itself in the role of being a source of destabilization. 
None of the parties which have entered the Duma and thereby 
gotten an image of respectability will wish to part with it, 
since the interests of each of them are linked with the future 
presidential election. This is why, among themselves, the Duma 
communists are stigmatizing V. Anpilov for his statements about 
returning soon to vigorous political activity. This is why A. 
Rutskoy and R. Khasbulatov have been forced to publish 
statements of political passivity. In turn it has to be 
considered no coincidence that the president's team on 4 March 
took a demonstrative step away from the democrats toward the 
"legal Marxists." 
  Following the amnesty decision a period of struggle against 
the president ended for the Duma and a stage of heavy lawmaking 
work began. Because the improvement of the state structure must 
not be tackled without parliament, and for the president this is 
one of the most important tasks today. At the same time the new 
Constitution, having strengthened the president's power and 
promoted stabilization, has also fully laid bare the importance 
under present conditions of the problem of the head of state's 
health. It is not difficult to trace in the examples of last 
July's internal political mini-crisis and the recent February 
one the fact that the president has only to fall ill for the 
situation in the country instantly to exacerbate. On the other 
hand, as soon as the president returns to active work, it at 
once calms down. 
  The political results of the government's enlarged session 
enable us to assume that Russia can reckon on a quiet life, at 
least for the next few months. It is even possible that the 
traditional spring offensive by the opposition's extremist wing 
will not affect this process. But a subsequent exacerbation of 
the situation seems highly likely. The problem of growing 
unemployment has all the potential to become the chief 
destabilizing factor. It will primarily depend on the prime 
minister how successful he is in neutralizing this danger by 
implementing those ideas in his speech which deal with the 
organization of public works and with other measures that can 
curb the social explosion. But subsequently, as the 
presidential election approaches, the spiral of political 
confrontation will inevitably grow, and it is perfectly possible 
that approximately six months before the voting the Duma will 
pass a vote of no confidence in the government in order to 
neutralize the prime minister politically.

  [Excerpts] The president of Romania and the delegation 
accompanying him have arrived at the president's office and the 
Seimas. Talks between Algirdas Brazauskas, president of 
Lithuania, and Ion Iliescu, president of Romania, began at 1400. 
The closed meeting of the two presidents lasted half an hour. 
Following this a meeting of the state delegations headed by the 
heads of the states was held. [passage omitted] 
  In a short impromptu interview given to Lithuanian and 
Romanian journalists, Algirdas Brazauskas said that issues 
related to the foreign and internal policies of both countries 
were discussed by the two presidents. He stressed that their 
two countries have many similarities -- both Lithuania and 
Romania are currently solving problems of economic reform and 
privatization. Algirdas Brazauskas also mentioned that there 
were very many similar trends in the foreign policy of both 
states. For example both states give priority to good relations 
with neighboring states. 
  Prospects for integration by both the states into the 
European Union, and the implementation of the NATO Partnership 
for Peace program were discussed by the presidents. 
  Nerijus Maliukevicius, the president's spokesman for the 
press, told ELTA that Algirdas Brazauskas acquainted the 
Romanian president and the delegation with the social and 
economic situation in Lithuania. [passage omitted] 
  Ion Ilescu stressed during the talks that Lithuania and 
Romania are united by the wish to arrange relations with their 
neighbors in such a way that these will not become hotbeds of 
tension either now or in future. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Adolfas Slezevicius, Lithuanian prime minister </F>
and LDDP chairman: "Stability, Social Market, Patient Work"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  1. Instead of Introduction </H5>
  The government formed by the Lithuanian Democratic Labor 
Party [LDDP] has not yet worked a full year (the government 
program was approved by the Seimas [parliament] on 31 March 
1993). Its activities could be most briefly characterized by 
the fact that the integral inflation rate has been 93 percent 
since the day the government began its work. Compared with 
former governments (the total sum of inflation rate over the 
three years exceeded 6,500 percent), this indicator 
implies the beginning of a stabilization of the economic 
crisis. If we also added the obvious facts that last year, 
the growth in pensions, social benefits, and salaries of 
employees at budget-financed offices exceeded the rate of 
inflation, that is, a real 12.7-percent increase in people's 
living standards occurred for the first time after the 
declaration of independence, the statements about stabilization, 
for which I am often criticized, would not be worth arguing. 
  I understand those people, each separate person, with whom I 
meet in various regions, villages, and towns of Lithuania every 
week, that not all of them have felt a slight economic 
improvement. The condition of each community member does not 
depend on government policy alone. Their personal abilities are 
no less important. However, the government must see general 
tendencies and direct its policies along these lines. I have 
never refused to assist anyone, any countryman in trouble, 
certainly, within my possibilities. 
  However, I cannot understand those who are violently 
attacking the formulation of stabilization -- is striving for 
stabilization useless for Lithuania? Can anyone offer something 
else instead? 
  It is particularly difficult to understand those opponents 
who, being in the former legislature and government, ruined the 
country by ill-considered reform and failed to predict its 
effects. By the way, I suppose that radicalism is typical of 
the opponents also because the latter failed to understand the 
results. 
  Having won the elections, the LDDP did not intend to "settle 
scores" with the former government. Last year, we limited 
ourselves to naming the "heroes and authors" of reform. 
However, their current desire to cast off historical 
responsibility for the nation, demagogy, and even the 
instigation of social conflicts force me to briefly return to 
the legacy we inherited. 

<H5>    II. What Did the LDDP Government Inherit? </H5>
  A short reply would be the following: Enormous inflation, a 
budget deficit, great social problems, and state debts; as well 
as fake money, disrupted settlements among economic entities, an 
open gate to organized crime and corruption, and a demoralized 
Interior Ministry system. I will not expand on society's 
spiritual losses inflicted by the opposition policy of the 
former government. They cannot be measured in terms of percent. 
  In the life of every family or individual this manifested 
itself not only as the shortage of heating or hot water, 
continuous price rises, the total devaluation of savings with 
trust in the promises of [former Prime Minister] G. Vagnorius, 
the chaos in agriculture, tenants' fear of being evicted from 
apartments, but also as false hopes and misleading illusions. 
The large credit of human trust in reform was wasted. 
  I must speak about all this because the opposition cannot 
realize its true obligation and tries to blame the economic 
crisis on our government, at the same time ruining our attempts 
to stabilize the economic situation. Let us recall how during 
the elections people demanded punishment of the real destroyers 
of the economy. Certainly, if we launch the tradition of 
"squaring accounts" with former governments, we will never have 
concord or a natural change of power in Lithuania, as well as a 
normal state development. 

<H3>    III. What Did We Manage To Accomplish In Less Than a 
Year? </H3>
  I think that the government will summarize the results of 
its 
activities and present them to the public after its full year in 
office. By doing this we, like the president, will establish a 
tradition of assessing the road covered and reporting back to 
the voters (we remember that this is what we lacked; this was 
also one of the key reasons for the collapse of the former 
policy). A constant self-critical assessment of one's policy 
alone can ensure progress and correct decisions. 
  The LDDP government, like its former counterparts, has 
worked 
according to the program approved in the Seimas. Thus far, 
however, our government has been the first and the only one to 
prepare a plan of definite action for the implementation of the 
government program (it was approved at the government meeting on 
30 June 1992 with the participation of chairmen from the Seimas 
committees). The government program would be left hanging in 
the air without such a plan, as was the case with former 
governments. As leader of the government, I maintain that the 
key goals of this plan have already been achieved, and part of 
the draft laws have already been submitted to the Seimas. 
  We remember the successful introduction of the national 
currency, the essential breakthrough in liberalizing foreign 
trade, and the preparation of a national program for 
agriculture. I think that the draft law on land currently being 
debated in the Seimas should become another serious impulse for 
land reform, which has the most problems. The free ownership of 
land will not only make agriculture private but will also allow 
small farmers to cooperate and the successful ones to grow 
larger. 
  In my opinion, we are often groundlessly criticized for the 
absence of concepts or plans. This is either poor information 
or a superficial attitude. Apart from the agricultural program, 
we have also drafted programs for the national systems of 
energy, transportation, and communications. Last week, the 
government approved the program of industrial restructuring, 
although this might have been slightly delayed. It is known, 
however, that our government did not take over any more serious 
achievements in this sphere from its predecessors. 
  One could draw the conclusion that the government is aware 
of 
the perspective and knows what it wants, where it is going, and 
what the results of such activities can be. In short, the 
government has created a programmatic and conceptual basis for 
its activities in all industries and spheres of social life. 
The government has also submitted several draft laws on law 
enforcement to the Seimas. They should make our state 
management considerably more efficient and strengthen law and 
order, which are indispensable in any state's life. 
  Since the very first days of our activities, we have focused 
on the execution of the budget. Having started the previous 
year with a 52-million litai [Lt] deficit, we finished it with a 
favorable balance of Lt65 million. This allowed the government 
to review (increase) wages and pensions nine times. The 
government assigned Lt343 million of budget revenues for this 
purpose, including Lt52 million for the indexation of 
inhabitants' savings, Lt96 million for self-governments, and so 
on. 
  Certainly, it is necessary to upgrade the tax system, to 
impose more reasonable taxes on profitable businesses, and exact 
hidden taxes, which we partially managed to achieve last year 
(almost Lt100 million was exacted). It is very important that 
the Seimas adopted the 1994 budget at the end of the last year, 
that is, before the beginning of the fiscal year. This is also 
an indicator of a more stable functioning of the state and the 
economy. 
  I would like to stress once again that the 1994 budget 
is much more socially oriented than all previous budgets 
since the declaration of independence. Both our social 
democrats and other opponents often claim incorrectly that the 
LDDP government allegedly does not pursue a social democratic 
policy. However, the larger part of the 1994 budget, that is, 
59 percent have been earmarked for social security. This growth 
is particularly noticeable in such areas as, for example, 
science -- 208 percent, education -- 175 percent, health care -- 
183 percent, and others. Thus, the facts are totally different 
-- the government policy is directed toward allaying the costs 
of reform for residents. This is being accomplished through 
monthly increases in social benefits and payments according to 
possibilities rather than through words or promises of a 
"bright" future. 

<H5>    IV. "Debts," Investments, and Perspective </H5>
  There has been much talk about the "dimensions of the debt": 
Lithuania is head over heels in debt, its residents' 
"grandchildren will fail to repay these debts," and so on. What 
is the actual situation? Lithuania's average current debt is 
$160 per capita, $90 of which have already been used. The 
current government was forced to take out large loans for energy 
because it had inherited $86 million of debts and $25 million of 
fines for gas, to say nothing of the absence of any working 
capital in the energy system. I would like to stress as the 
same time that the pure hard currency reserve at the Lithuanian 
Bank has climbed by 2.8 times since March 1993 and is now $261 
million, which is equivalent to the amount of utilized foreign 
credits. Thus, what debt are we talking about?! We must 
clearly understand that there cannot be any economic 
reform without investment and credit resources. It is only 
this that can help us achieve the vital breakthrough in the 
policy of economic restructuring. Incidentally, our agreements 
with the IMF were concluded for a period of 18 months. A 
program for another three years that is being drafted now 
projects five credit lines in restructuring different 
industries. These are agriculture, social programs, the 
restructuring of banks, and energy. 
  It is evident that we must spend increasingly more credit 
reserves on expanding investments. This task has been put 
forward and its is being implemented in practice. In 
cooperation with various global financial organizations, we are 
preparing changes in the acquisition, utilization, and repayment 
of credits, and in the organization structure of accounts. This 
will allow a more rational utilization of credit resources. 
Moreover, the fact that an increasingly larger part of loans 
goes to investments through commercial banks is also very 
important. Large-scale credit resources and economic 
restructuring create more favorable conditions for promoting 
investments. 
  Out of Lithuania's current 3,467 joint ventures, 768 work on 
foreign capital alone! The emergence of such ventures has 
become very dynamic recently. The total amount of investments 
in all joint ventures accounts for more than 85 percent. The 
current sum of investments is $200 million. As I have already 
mentioned, the system of acquiring and utilizing credits is 
being upgraded. A very important document, that will soon be 
submitted to the Seimas, is a new draft law on foreign 
investments. This law should be more efficient in promoting 
investments and introducing equal conditions for foreign and 
local investors. We have set up the Lithuanian Development Bank 
-- an important institution for receiving and promoting 
investments, and the Investment Agency. 
  We hope that this year we will invest about $150-200 million 
or almost Lt600-800 million into the economy through various 
forms, state guarantees, the direct state debt, various 
commercial credits, and the joint effort of local investors. 
These investments and the general changes in the economic 
restructuring allow quite dynamic adjustments in the structure 
of exports and imports, although Russia remains our chief 
partner in purchasing resources. If we consider our exports to 
the West, however, in 1993 it accounted for almost 40 percent 
(against the meager 15 percent in 1991). It is extremely 
important that such economically powerful states as Germany, 
Belgium, and the Scandinavian countries become our principal 
partners. Certainly, these processes must be encouraged in 
every possible way, and this is what we are doing. 
<H5>  V. Instead of Conclusion </H5>
  Certainly, it is impossible to study all aspects and 
problems 
of government's activities in one article. I expect to be able 
to do this later. The government, as well as I -- its prime 
minister and LDDP chairman, are concerned with the situation in 
culture, science, and education. We know that their condition 
is miserable, and we are holding numerous consultations and 
searching for resolutions. 
  The management of the state is also a complicated problem. 
Unlike any other sphere, this one, probably, receives the 
largest amount of advice and recommendations -- from liberal and 
anarchist to stagnant conservative. I think that the time of 
the revolution is over, and our decisions must acquire a 
consistent evolutionary character. The officials' competence 
rather than number is important. In turn, the government must 
train its staff with the awareness of state interests and create 
relevant conditions for them. 
  It is common knowledge that both before and after the 
elections, the LDDP spoke out for cooperation with all political 
forces. Thus far, we have failed to achieve this. All more 
influential parties, except a few personalities, refused to 
cooperate and are continuing the "policy of LDDP isolation" 
which, in my opinion, is fruitless and damaging to Lithuania. 
Meanwhile, Lithuania requires consolidation and political 
accord. The road to agreement or a consensus is not a one-sided 
effort. It requires overall tolerance, goodwill, and political 
wisdom. I believe that many oppositional parties understand 
today that the plans to isolate the LDDP have failed. Thus, let 
us look for agreement and common ground. The opposition should 
abandon the tone of ultimatums, actions which inspire conflicts, 
and demagogy in the first place. If we manage to rise above our 
party ambitions, Lithuania's political culture and democracy, 
that is, every individual, will gain from this.

  [Text] A couple of news conferences were held today at the 
Lithuanian Seimas. The first was on Russian-Lithuanian 
relations. Guoda Salciute reports. 
  [Salciute] Vytautas Landsbergis, Seimas opposition leader, 
presented a statement to journalists at a news conference today, 
concerning Russia's responsibility to Lithuania. Vytautas 
Landsbergis also gave a review of trends in Russian policy 
toward the Baltic states. 
  According to Professor Landsbergis the case of the 
independence of the Baltic states is now nearing a critical 
point. We see the latest statements issued by the Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in which, under the guise of the 
Russian issue [of the Russian-speaking population], all the 
attention is concentrated on the justification of an expansion 
toward the West, Landsbergis said. 
  Latvia has already been broken down after the big states 
abandoned the principle, which they themselves formulated, of 
the unconditional withdrawal of the armed forces; meanwhile 
Estonia, while coming closer to the zero option -- i.e. giving 
up the demand for compensation in the negotiations with Russia 
-- will become the test case, the leader of the opposition 
maintained. 
  Vytautas Landsbergis stressed that there is no need to 
appeal 
once again to the United Nations concerning the recognition of 
the Russian occupation. This is the main issue in the 
statement. I quote: Russia has declared itself the successor 
of the USSR and in some important cases the international 
community agreed with this, the statement reads. In the treaty 
of 29 July 1991, Russia recognized the acts of restoration of 
Lithuania's independence and renounced the annexation carried 
out by the USSR. The referendum of Lithuanian citizens of 14 
June 1992 firmly declared a sovereign conviction that Russia, 
having declared itself heir to the USSR, has also taken over the 
responsibility for the damage to Lithuania inflicted by the 
occupation, the damage which should be compensated for. 
  Therefore, bearing in mind all these circumstances, the 
reports that the president of Lithuania intends to discuss 
whether Lithuania and other Baltic states were occupied by the 
USSR or not at the oncoming summit of the Baltic states look 
rather surprising -- as does an appeal to the world requesting a 
reiteration of the recognition of the occupation. Whatever the 
diplomats of the Baltic states or the Russian lobbyists in 
Vilnius might propose, the very fact that the existence of the 
occupation is doubted would mean great harm to the interests of 
our state and a violation of the main documents of our 
independence. 
  The Lithuanian president should not be drawn into such 
dangerous maneuvers, Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the 
parliamentary opposition, says in his statement on Russia's 
responsibility to Lithuania.

<F P=106> [Statement by the Lithuanian Land Workers' Union Council </F>
Presidium "On the Privatization of Personal Land"] 
  [Text] Lithuania's rural areas are experiencing an 
extremely difficult period. Therefore, following its principle 
of defending the interests of land workers, the Lithuanian Land 
Workers' Union can no longer bear with the voluntaristic 
gibberish concerning the process of land reform, and the rules 
of restoring land and the right to real estate, which recently 
has come from the particularly vigorous Landowners' Union, as 
well as parties, nationalistic groups, and separate social 
activists who support it. 
  Pursuing political goals, they are trying, in particular, to 
stir and paint with different colors the issue of privatizing 
personal land. Appealing to justice and the sacred feeling of 
ownership, the ideologists of this union and parties want to 
return to the distant past, forgetting that it is impossible to 
divide our rural settlements into detached farmhouses, parcel 
out reclaimed farmland as plots, and move the urban population 
to rural areas. We understand that the commotion that is being 
raised around this issue is not casual, the more so that the 
current law regulating land reform states that personal land 
cannot be restored to other persons, and one is allowed to 
acquire it in the same manner as land plots for private housing. 
The forces which are interested in this commotion want to 
deprive the rural people of the right to produce themselves the 
amount of food and animal feed necessary for their families and 
personal farms. 
  Since the very beginning of its activities, the Lithuanian 
Land Workers' Union has tried to implement its program principle 
-- "to legalize land ownership for those who work it, and former 
owners and their children who are returning to farming in rural 
areas." This formulation of the problem has been unequivocal in 
all Land Workers' Union documents over its three-year 
activities. Currently, we have a real chance of resolving this 
issue, which would allow to stabilize the situation of landless 
countrymen and remove social tension. 
  Considering these circumstances, the Presidium of the 
Lithuanian Land Workers' Union Council states and proposes the 
following: 
  1. People who live and work in the country have never lost 
their link with the land, and they have preserved farm buildings 
and kept animals. Their personal farms are a guarantor of rural 
stability and a condition for training future farmers and 
imparting a master's feeling in young people. At the same time, 
they are the principal source of income for rural pensioners and 
other persons who require social support. Therefore, the 
ownership right to this land must not depend on landowner's 
goodwill -- it must be guaranteed by the state which takes care 
of its nation's existence. 
  2. World experience and the laws of a market economy require 
free ownership of land by the user. Therefore, personal land 
must be legalized as private property that can be restored 
instead of formerly possessed land in other places or sold to 
families which have no land to reclaim. This would be more just 
than to restore the land cultivated over decades to former 
owners' children and grandchildren who will never work it and 
will take part of annual profits earned by workers who lease 
this land. 
  3. Personal land must be situated in places where it is more 
convenient for workers to farm it, despite the fact who owned it 
according to prewar reform. Users themselves, in cooperation 
with specialists in land development, must decide how to use the 
land situated near settlements. Land plots in common use must 
also be privatized by the general right of ownership, if there 
is overall agreement. This would create more favorable 
conditions for cooperation, mechanized farming, fertilizing, 
caring for crops, harvesting, renewing cultured grassland, and 
coordinating this work through crop rotation with the land owned 
by large agrarian companies or individual farmers. 
  4. Considering the difficult economic situation of land 
workers, the latter must have the right to buy land not only for 
money but also for single state payments. The state rather than 
new owners must pay former owners in line with the law, whose 
land has been ascribed as repurchased by the state and 
non-restorable. Since compensation must be paid from the funds 
accumulated from the sale of land in state possession, it is 
necessary to legalize the payment for land acquired for private 
ownership before the final arrangement of agreements on land 
sale and purchase. 
  5. It is on personal land alone that food production has not 
dropped under the difficult and complicated conditions of 
agrarian reform, and this proves the economic expediency of such 
land. After vital economic structures become established in 
rural areas (large or specialized cooperatives or stock 
companies with intensive farming), personal land will either 
naturally transform itself into them or remain the source of 
guaranteed food and income for rural families who are unable to 
work or who are forced to search for work in other sectors. 
Thus, there can be no restraints for workers to acquire this 
land, regardless of its demand for other purposes. This is the 
undisputable right of all people who did not abandon farming in 
the former difficult period. 
  6. We appeal to the Government of the Republic of Lithuania 
to consider our proposals and promptly resolve the issue of 
privatizing personal land. [Signed] The Presidium of the 
Lithuanian Land Workers' Union Council

  [Excerpt] The second power unit at the Ignalina power 
station was put back into operation last night. 
  Genadiy Negrivoda, chief engineer at the nuclear power 
station, told the Baltic News Service correspondent that all the 
work was carried out smoothly and according to the planned 
schedule. 
  Today the second power unit is operating with the capacity 
of 
700 MW and the first unit at 1,000 MW. According to Mr. 
Negrivoda this amount of power is sufficient for the needs of 
consumers, therefore, neither of the units is operating at the 
maximum capacity of 1,300 MW. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Negrivoda also said that the first unit of the nuclear 
power station is to be shut down at the beginning of April for 
routine maintenance. 
  This year as a result of minor malfunction the first and the 
second reactors at the Ignalina nuclear station were shut down 
on 18 and 29 of January.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Volynskiy report: "A Political Joke From the Times </F>
of Yevno Azef"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg -- A shocking report was issued by 
the antiterrorist service of the St. Petersburg Administration 
of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS]: A group of 
terrorists were intending to kill city mayor Anatoliy Sobchak 
and organize an attack on Government House in Moscow! The 
report was immediately picked up by the press and television. 
  A few days later, the same service circulated reports and a 
video about its operation to capture another "villain" -- 
Russian Party Chairman Nikolay Bondarik, who was a candidate for 
the city assembly. It turns out that he too was preparing 
various terrorist acts. A report on the Independent Television 
channel said that Bondarik's people had already killed someone. 
A group of armed men in camouflage uniforms and masks were 
shown seizing Bondarik, who was maintaining the calm of an 
Ancient Egyptian. The fighters were fearlessly twisting the 
arms of some weedy youth, a partner in crime, who had "offered 
resistance" to a dozen splendidly armed staffers of the 
antiterrorist service. 
  All this information, reported to the press at a news 
conference specially called by the FCS administration, has 
generated a mass of questions. The "Great Russia" pre-election 
association, which the candidate for the city assembly belonged 
to, has issued a protest over his arrest and expressed the hope 
that a mistake was made. For several days I tried unsuccessfully 
to meet with A. Kuznetsov, leader of the antiterrorism service. 
There must obviously be a really large number of terrorists 
spread around town. 
  But if we are talking about a specific case -- the arrest of 
five individuals who had seized some weapons, then the question 
arises, like in the well-known joke about Cowboy Joe: "How can 
someone need uncatchable Joe?" For the very reason that he is 
"uncatchable." Any high official of the FCS administration or 
the Internal Affairs Main Directorate with whom I have discussed 
the possibility of an attempt on Sobchak has responded with an 
ironic smile. 
  However, let us assume that the five, headed by retired 
Captain A. Bogdanov, as the FCS Administration reports, did 
nevertheless take it into their head to deprive the St. 
Petersburg population of its beloved mayor. From the clinical 
point of view, how right in the head are they? After all, they 
had also hatched another terrible plan: to carry out an attack 
on the government building in Moscow, which could be seized by 
terrifying a few thousand professionals from the Kremlin 
security guard. 
  The five, as has been officially reported, tried to seize 
some weapons. They attacked the security room of the "Zarya" 
science and production association, where (I quote VECHERNIY 
PETERBURG) "they tied up the female security guards and took 
several revolvers and several thousand cartridges for them from 
a safe. As they were leaving the security department the 
bandits found people waiting for them who were certainly not 
elderly women. The operation to capture them took a few 
seconds." 
  "We had them under surveillance for quite a long time," A. 
Kuznetsov said, reporting the sensational details of the capture. 
  But, excuse me, if the surveillance took a long time, does 
that mean that an agent of the FCS administration had been 
infiltrated into the group? Meaning that the agent behaved like 
the unforgotten Yevno Azef, who was leader of the Combat 
Organization of Socialist Revolutionaries and simultaneously the 
most valued agent of the Czarist police department. And 
objectively speaking, the role of the FCS administration agent 
was a provocative one, since measures were not taken to put an 
end to the preparation of the crime. In this episode the crime 
was carried through. Consequently, those who were carrying out 
surveillance of this group "for quite a long time" were 
interested in it being committed. Which leads to the conclusion 
that the episode involving the arrest of the five putative 
capturers of Government House in Moscow is a political card, 
pure and simple, played at a time of a deterioration in 
relations on the political Olympus. This is also informed by the 
persistent repetition in the FCS that all five were allegedly 
involved in the October (1993) events in Moscow, sided with the 
defenders of the House of Soviets, and decided to avenge the 
defeat of the lawful authorities. 
  Equally surprising questions arise when you analyze the 
arrest of N. Bondarik, who has also been declared to be a 
terrorist. Who was killed by Bondarik and his accomplices has 
not been reported, yet this is a factor of most fundamental 
importance. 
  In connection with Bondarik's arrest, Independent Television 
showed some object resembling a sawed-off shotgun and said that 
Bondarik and co. had been illegally hoarding weapons. Had this 
shotgun killed some state figure? 
  And what about the theft of revolvers and cartridges from 
the 
"Zarya" science and production association? Some 2,000 rounds 
(some newspapers talk about "several thousand") taken from a 
place where the elderly lady guards are most often issued with 
revolvers which -- to prevent unpleasantness -- are completely 
rustfree? 
  But if the conclusions from the inevitable questions are 
correct, the verdict is equally correct: The operations 
described above were pretty crude! In general all these matters 
are quite a long way removed from counterintelligence tasks. 
They are much closer to the political surveillance whose 
elimination was announced by President Yeltsin when he 
dismantled the Russian Federation Ministry of Security, in the 
probable belief that his stupid subjects would believe that the 
state can manage without political surveillance. Surveillance 
there is, but it looks like it is guided not by state tasks but 
by the whims of its immediate boss.

<F P=106> [Viktor Filippov report: "All Power to the Governor. 20 </F>
March Could Be the Last Day of Democracy in Vologda Region"] 
  [Text] Vologda -- Governor Nikolay Podgornov's decree on 
the 20 March elections to the oblast duma and local 
self-government organs have angered Vologda politicians from 
both right and left. Meanwhile the oblast prosecutor's office 
has protested against the decrees because they do not accord 
with the Russian Constitution and the president's edicts. 
  But the governor has rejected the prosecutor's office 
protest 
and has pretended not to notice the critical comments made by 
communists, agrarians, and even "Democratic Russia" supporters 
-- incidentally, to date the last-named group had supported 
Podgornov. Since the regional elections complete the reform of 
the authorities, they should calm the political situation. But 
no -- the Vologda people have become even more worried. 
  "I am disturbed that the constitutional principle of the 
separation of powers has been violated," Albert Volkov, senior 
physician from the city of Sokol and candidate for the oblast 
Duma, says. "Administration employees have been allowed to run 
for the oblast Duma. I am afraid that our representative 
authority will be swallowed up by the executive." 
  Volkov's fear is not without foundation. Eighteen officials 
from the oblast and rayon administrations have been registered 
as candidates for the 115 deputies' seats in the oblast Duma. 
But experience of previous elections shows that authority 
members have incomparably greater chances of winning electors' 
votes than ordinary candidates. 
  But while the oblast Duma's future depends, if only to a 
small extent, on Vologda inhabitants' choice, Podgornov has 
unconditionally subordinated local self-government organs to the 
executive branch. Under a statute approved by him, the dumas in 
Vologda and Cherepovets will be run by the heads of these 
cities' administrations, appointed by the governor. As for 
rayon assemblies, they are generally being formed from leaders 
of village and settlement administrations. Podgornov has 
abolished representative authority in the ancient cities of 
Totma, Belozersk, Velikiy Ustyug, Kirillov, and Ustyuzhna, where 
it has existed for centuries. 
  The governor has called a referendum on the adoption of an 
oblast charter at the same time as the elections on 20 March. 
The draft of this fundamental law for the Vologda region has 
been prepared by a narrow circle of people appointed by 
Podgornov. Representatives of parties and movements were not 
allowed to work on the project and, when the document was 
finally published at the end of February, they saw that their 
worst fears had come true. 
  "I personally cannot vote for this charter," Sergey Smirnov, 
a leader of the Vologda branch of "Democratic Russia," says. 
"Property must be under the control of two branches: The 
representative branch disposes and the executive manages. But 
under the draft charter the possession, use, disposal, and 
management of all the oblast's property is effected by the 
executive branch in the person of the governor. That is nothing 
but dictatorship. 
  In the opinion of Russian presidential representative Guriy 
Sudakov, the draft charter preserves the idea of separatism, 
which the oblast Soviet tried to implement by proclaiming the 
"Vologda Republic" in May 1993. All the oblast's natural 
resources are proclaimed the exzclusive property of those who 
live here, while there is not a word about Russia. And the 
governor -- the effective owner of the Vologda region -- is 
distanced from the federal authorities: Under the Vologda 
charter he cannot be removed from his post even by the Russian 
president. 
  The oblast has over 900,000 voters, yet the administration 
printed the draft charter only in its newspaper KRASNYY SEVER, 
whose print run is only 29,000 copies. So Vologda inhabitants 
are familiar with the proposals it contains only through hearsay. 
  When RUSSKIY SEVER, another Vologda newspaper, ventured to 
speak critically of the governor's actions, at a press 
conference Podgornov called journalists a corrupt group of 
people trying to discredit him on Moscow's orders and receiving 
very large sums of money for doing so. The governor's monologue 
was immediately shown by the "Vologda" television channel. 
According to RUSSKIY SEVER journalists the governor is 
determined to "remove" Chief Editor Vladimir Pantsyrev from the 
newspaper and, if the editorial office opposes this, to evict it 
from its building, which is oblast property.

Oblast election commission; by unidentified reporter; from the

  [Text] The attempt by Sakhalin residents to create a 
bicameral oblast parliament was not successful. The oblast was 
corrected by Moscow. 
  [Begin recording] [Ryazantsev] The Moscow authorities 
wanted, 
on one hand, to box our ears and put the regions in their place 
so that they would not act too independently, and on the other 
hand, the goal is probably to whittle down our representative 
power and reduce it, making it into some kind of decorative 
screen. 
  Frankly, my first emotional response was as follows: If 
Article 77 of the Russian Constitution, which postulates that 
nomination of oblast and kray authorities is the prerogative of 
federation members, is being directly violated here, then we 
should not do it, we should just distance ourselves from it and 
not do such work. But on the other hand, the representative 
power has to be elected. Even if I and other members of the 
commission leave, the elections still need to be carried out. 
The only thing we will accomplish is making the elections more 
difficult. 
  [Reporter] So you are staying? 
  [Ryazantsev] For the time being, I am, and I think that 
other 
members of the election committee also are not seriously 
considering leaving. But like an aftertaste, a very bitter 
residue remains. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Golyayev: "In Siberia Too an Owner </F>
Must Be an Owner"] 
  [Text] The Russian regions belonging to the "Siberian 
agreements" association have elaborated a package of proposals 
for the government on changes to the foreign economic activity 
mechanism. 
  Returning Friday evening from a routine session of this 
association, in a talk with journalists First Vice Premier Oleg 
Soskovets noted the fairness of the Siberians' demands. "They 
still have no right to export or to form banks, which are all in 
Moscow, particularly oil banks. The situation must be 
rectified. There is nothing more terrible than the 
centralization of finances. There are strong people and science 
in Siberia -- an enormous potential and the world's richest 
region are in such a lamentable state. There is no logic to it." 
  "Today over 60 percent of the regions live on subsidies from 
the center. There should be a very balanced policy for 
transferring powers to the localities. The management of 
property locally through instructions from Moscow, as some 
departments are doing, is impermissible and unnecessary. It is 
property which is the main priority for local organs. The 
enterprise collectives must be the genuine owners and really 
feel that they are the owners. That will be both rational and 
respectful with regard to people and to the labor collective 
which in this instance workers for itself, for the interests of 
the region, and ultimately for the state. So far," the first 
vice premier stressed, "we treat property formally. I hope that 
the second stage of voucher privatization will make it possible 
to remove many so far unresolved questions." 
  "What is your attitude toward the appearance of questions in 
the press asking `Who is Oleg Soskovets working for?'" 
  "Of course it is unpleasant but not because they have 
pointed 
a finger at me. Someone is trying to `make politics,' resorting 
to utterly incorrect facts and interpreting them as they want."

  [Text] Vladikavkaz March 7 TASS -- "The expanded session of 
the government of the Russian Federation has mapped out the 
contours of our common approach towards solving economic 
problems," North Ossetian President Askharbek Galazov said. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS at Vladikavkaz's airport upon 
his return from Moscow on Monday, Galazov said that he supported 
the idea of strengthening Russian statehood announced by 
President Boris Yeltsin. This provides the basis for continuing 
reform, overcoming the crisis, carrying out structural reform 
and creating conditions for economic, political and social 
stabilisation, Galazov said. He welcomed the president's 
state-of-the-nation address as a starting point for developing 
and carrying out social and economic policy in regions. 
  Speaking about the prospects for implementing economic 
reforms in North Ossetia, its leader said that the republic is 
an integral part of Russia. Its multi-national population 
cannot perceive its development in isolation from other 
republics and regions of the North Caucasus and the rest of 
Russia. 
  Galazov described the situation in the republic as stable. 
However, there are certain forces in the region which are 
seeking to push the peoples of North Ossetia and Ingushetia to 
confrontation, he said. Galazov confirmed his initiative to 
hold, without mediators, a meeting between the presidents of 
North Ossetia and Ingushetia to discuss ways to restore peace 
and streamline bilateral relations.

  [Text] Groznyy March 7 TASS -- Chechen President Dzhokhar 
Dudayev issued a decree on Monday to tighten regulations for 
entering or leaving the republic. Under the decree, those who 
want to enter or leave the Chechen Republic will have to 
register with the republican security department five days in 
advance. 
  The president explained that the move has been prompted by 
the need to "thwart attempts of subversive activity against the 
Chechen Republic and block routes of escape for dangerous 
criminals." There are over 20 such criminals in the republic, 
according to the Chechen public prosecutor's office. Their 
names have been published by the local press.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Gritchin report: "Khasbulatov Met in Chechnya With </F>
Enthusiasm and Wariness"] 
  [Text] Chechnya has never welcomed anyone with so much 
extravagance as it welcomed R. Khasbulatov, who was recently 
regarded as persona non grata in the republic. 
  Surrounded by bodyguards, the former Lefortovo prisoner is 
traveling around Groznyy accompanied by a motorcade of foreign 
cars to be welcomed by machine-gun and assault-rifle salutes 
from his fellow tribesmen. There was an enthusiastic welcome in 
his native village, where horse races involving the most 
daredevil and skillful horsemen were timed specially for his 
arrival. Reporters from local, Russian, and international news 
agencies were present in abundance. 
  Khasbulatov's trip to his homeland with the avowed aim of 
visiting his elderly mother took on major political significance 
for the republic the moment his aircraft touched down at Groznyy 
airport. The guest was met at the ramp not just by his 
brothers, close relatives, and representatives of the Kharachoy 
clan, which, incidentally, is one of the many distinguished 
clans in Chechnya. (A village bearing this name survives to this 
day in the mountainous area of the republic. One representative 
of this clan -- the bandit avenger Zelimkhan Kharacheyevskiy, 
who devoted his life to struggling against the czarist forces -- 
was well known in prerevolutionary Russia). Many inhabitants of 
Chechnya considered it their duty to meet with their 
distinguished compatriot. 
  However, the present enthusiasm in the republic is not quite 
as instinctive as it was two-and-a-half years ago, when Ruslan 
Imranovich assumed the office of chairman of the Russian Supreme 
Soviet. At that time he was the republic's national hero. But 
his neutrality over attempting to impose order in Chechnya by 
strong-arm methods came as an unpleasant surprise to his 
enraptured fellow citizens. So the current rejoicing is mingled 
with wariness: What plans does this man have in Chechnya? His 
possible opposition to the present regime in Groznyy and the 
possibility of his making a bid for power in the republic would, 
by the admission of a staffer at the Chechen Republic Department 
for Information and the Press who wished to remain anonymous in 
the newspaper, constitute an extremely dangerous threat to 
Dudayev. 
  This is apparently why official Groznyy is trying to be 
markedly attentive to its distinguished guest, who has regained 
the sympathy of thousands of his compatriots during his period 
of disfavor. President Dudayev took the first steps towards 
reconciliation with his arch-opponent in good time: He returned 
to Khasbulatov the Chechen citizenship of which he had been 
stripped, and immediately before his release from Lefortovo he 
stated his belief that the Chechen prisoner was innocent. He 
attempted to display honor befitting this lofty statesman at 
Groznyy airport as well, where the president's secretary of 
state and aide greeted the guest. But the exultant crowd pushed 
aside the senior officials and prevented them from getting close 
to their idol, whom they mobbed in a fit of enthusiasm. 
  On the third day of his stay in Chechnya, Khasbulatov 
visited 
the memorial built to honor the victims of the deportation of 
the Chechen people, whom the president's supporters call 
"Dzhokhar's children," and spoke at a small rally there. 
  Whatever happens in Chechnya, official Groznyy is currently 
hoping for something else -- that the Chechen celebrity, whose 
popularity at a time when the republic is in a state of collapse 
represents a real danger for President Dudayev, will depart as 
soon as possible for the Russian capital.

<F P=106> [Sergey Tsekhmistrenko report: "Adamishin Prods Tajik </F>
Opposition Toward Compromise"] 
  [Text] The long experience of the Afghan war appears to 
have convinced Russia that the intensity of combat operations in 
the region is directly dependent on the season of the year: In 
the spring the mojahedin left their winter dens, refreshed and 
invigorated, to continue the struggle against the "hated 
shuravis [Russians]" with new intensity. Fearing that something 
similar might happen in Tajikistan, Moscow has decided to 
preempt the events, and on the night of March 4 Russian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin left for Iran to conduct 
talks with the Tajik opposition. The purpose of the mission is 
to persuade the opponents of the current Tajik leader, Emomali 
Rakhmanov, to sit down at a "roundtable" of national 
reconciliation. 
  Moscow's rush to reconcile the Tajiks is entirely explicable 
-- the preservation of "social peace" in Tajikistan has cost 
Russia dear. As early as last September, during Andrey 
Kozyrev's visit to Dushanbe, the Russian foreign minister 
recommended that the Tajik authorities agree to a dialogue with 
that part of the opposition "holding a constructive stance." 
Your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent has been told at the 
Russian Foreign Ministry that at present the Tajiks are closer 
to a dialogue than ever before. In fact, what remains is to 
determine the location and the lineup of participants in the 
"roundtable." 
  Currently, Moscow is also pinning hopes on Tehran's 
assistance. A couple of years ago, the Iranians, drawing on 
their close linguistic and cultural ties with the Tajiks, tried 
to reconcile them without Russia so as to get certain dividends. 
Tehran leaders have fairly quickly learned, however, that there 
is no "struggle of the Muslims against the infidels" in 
Tajikistan: The conflict has a clan bottom-line. Having 
realized that its mediation has been in vain, Tehran recognized 
Moscow's interests in Tajikistan and suggested that they act 
together. Russia, for its part, relies on pragmatic Iranian 
leaders, who are more concerned over the maintenance of peace 
along the Iranian borders than the export of the Islamic 
revolution. As they are not interested in escalating tensions 
inside Afghanistan, these politicians may have certain influence 
on pro-Iranian groups deployed in the area of the Tajik-Afghan 
border (particularly those taking orders from Afghan President 
Borhanoddin Rabbani or the Islamic Unity Party). Although the 
question of how willing the field commanders are to pay heed to 
Tehran's advice is still open, Mr. Adamishin is going to discuss 
with Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati the 
possibility of coordinating the two countries' efforts to 
stabilize the situation on the border.

<F P=106> [From the "Panorama" program] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer Yelena Berezovskaya] As we have already 
reported, elections are being held in Kazakhstan today for the 
Republic's Supreme Soviet and local councils. Viktor 
Glukhovtsev, our Almaty correspondent, is now on the line to the 
Mayak studio. Over to you, Viktor Ivanovich: 
  [Glukhovtsev] Hello. 
  [Berezovskaya] We can hear you. 
  [Glukhovtsev] First and foremost, Yelena, let me greet you 
and all of our courageous women on the holiday; but here is what 
I have to tell you about the election. This is the first time 
in its history that Kazakhstan has held democratic elections in 
which every citizen has had the right to stand for the country's 
parliament. Many have made full use of this right. Public 
associations, for instance, registered 330 candidates for the 
Supreme Soviet election, but there are actually 30 more nominees 
than that. Those are the fruits of democracy for you. 
  Here's another point that needs to be noted. This is also 
the first time that foreign observers are monitoring the poll. 
Twenty-four states in Europe, the United States, and Asia have 
sent representatives to Kazakhstan, and they are scrupulously 
recording the slightest infraction of the election rules. There 
have not been many of these infractions, but there have been 
some, unfortunately. 
  The election code stipulates that premises where ballot 
papers are kept should be sealed and guarded by the militia. 
Checks have shown, however, that this rule has not been 
followed in some places. In some cases, packets of ballot papers 
were found to have been opened, the seals broken. The same code 
stipulates that each voter should vote in person and should turn 
up with the document proving his right to vote, but this 
stipulation has been ignored rather often in the scramble to 
ensure that the official turnout is as big as possible. Such 
violations of the electoral code are no credit to members of 
constituency and polling station commissions. They cast doubt 
on the legality of the final results. 
  Let me tell you a bit about the actual voting. According to 
preliminary figures, over 9.5 million people were eligible to 
vote. Voting began at 0700 this morning. By 1100 the figures 
were as follows. Some 1,275,000 people had turned up at polling 
stations to vote. This is 14 percent of the total. This is, of 
course, not much compared with previous years. In the 
republican capital, for example, only 11 percent had voted by 
then. In Turgay, West Kazakhstan, and Aktyubinsk oblasts it was 
even less. 
  [Berezovskaya] Viktor Ivanovich... 
  [Glukhovtsev, interrupting] Yes, yes. 
  [Berezovskaya] The latest figures may even have reached 
Moscow sooner than they reached you. At the moment -- or rather 
about two hours ago -- a third of the voters had already turned 
out in the Republic as a whole, it is reported. 
  [Glukhovtsev] Well, the Central Electoral Commission told 
me that in the Republic as a whole 58 percent of eligible voters 
had already cast their votes by 1600. So I have fresher 
information, so to speak. Those are the figures. 
  Well, that's all I have to tell you at the moment. This is 
Viktor Glukhovtsev with a special report for the Mayak 
"Panorama."

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 07, BNS -- The British Government says 
that Russia has to withdraw its troops from Estonia by Aug. 31, 
1994, and expresses regret over that Russia at the latest round 
of talks backed down on the deadline spoken of earlier. 
  The Russian delegation at the past, 17th round of talks with 
Estonia said Russia won't sign the agreement on troop 
withdrawal, the document that also sets the deadlines for the 
process, before Estonia ensures what Russia defines as social 
guarantees for its retired military in Estonia, and fulfills 
certain other conditions. 
  Officials at the British Embassy in Tallinn told BNS that 
the 
British Government was worried about such a statement from 
Russia. 
  "According to the final act of the CSCE Helsinki meeting of 
1992, Russia must withdraw its troops from Estonia quickly, in 
an orderly manner, and completely, and must not tie it to other 
issues. Also the international community has repeatedly 
underscored that the withdrawal of troops must take place 
without any additional conditions. Therefore, the Russian 
troops must be pulled out by Aug. 31 this year, as was earlier 
announced," the statement by the British Government says. 
  It also says that good relations between Estonia and Russia 
are essential to ensuring stability in whole Europe and that the 
withdrawal of Russian troops is a vital part of this process.

  [Text] Tehran March 7 TASS -- The leaders of the Tajik 
opposition stationed on Afghan territory have agreed to direct 
negotiations with the Dushanbe government in Moscow, given 
guarantees of their personal safety and presence of observers 
from the United Nations, Russia, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan. 
  This was announced by opposition delegation leader 
Khodzhiakbar Turadzhonzodah [name as received] told ITAR-TASS 
after winding up talks with Russian First Deputy Foreign 
Minister Anatoliy Adamishin here. 
  The Tajik opposition leader said he and other opposition 
leaders were prepared to leave for Moscow to meet with Dushanbe 
representatives. Anatoliy Adamishin confirmed what 
Turadzhonzodah said and stressed that talks in Tehran "resulted 
in a substantial step" towards the political settlement of the 
conflict in Tajikistan. 
  Negotiations on the political settlement of the conflict in 
Tajikistan were the main objective of Anatoliy Adamishin's visit 
to the Islamic Republic of Iran.

<F P=106> [Gulnara Khasanova report: "General Chechulin's Border </F>
Guards Will Strike Mojahedin With All Weapons at Their Disposal 
While Moscow Diplomats Try To Persuade the Opposition To Start 
Talks With the Authorities"] 
  [Text] Dushanbe -- Events on the Tajik-Afghan border only 
confirm suspicions about the upcoming spring and summer 
escalation of hostilities by Islamic opposition groupings. 
Practically every day brings new instances of Russian border 
posts and detachments being fired upon and attempted armed 
breakthroughs from the Afghan to the Tajik side of the river. 
In January and February Russian troop stationing locations came 
under rocket fire more than 60 times. 
  "This is a protracted guerrilla war," the military are 
saying. 
  The Tajik authorities insist, on the contrary, that the 
civil 
war in the republic is now over. After yet another border 
skirmish, the republic's Foreign Ministry is sending Kabul a 
protest note. Kabul rejects Dushanbe's protests, dismissing as 
groundless all accusations that "subversive activity against 
Tajikistan is being initiated from Afghan territory." 
  Kabul is of the opinion that Tajikistan should resolve its 
internal conflict independently, without enlisting any outside 
military force, and through political dialogue with the Tajik 
opposition. Kabul is uneasy about the Russian military presence 
near its borders. 
  Lieutenant General Anatoliy Chechulin, commander of the 
group 
of Russian Border Guards in Tajikistan, has stated that if 
border troops come under fire from Afghanistan, they are to 
return fire with all weapons at their disposal. 
  This extreme measure is justified by the Afghan leadership's 
powerlessness to control the situation in the border regions and 
avert audacious strikes by the Islamic opposition and Afghan 
mojahedin. 
  It is apparently implied that the targets are the 
uncontrollable opposition groupings. But how are they to be 
distinguished? 
  The gunmen do not stay in the same place; they prefer 
guerrilla methods of warfare: They arrive in an Afghan village, 
shell a border post, and go away again. Or small groups cross 
the border and strike from the rear. 
  General Chechulin does not share the opinion that armed 
confrontation between Russian servicemen and the government 
subunits supporting them on the one hand, and the Islamic 
opposition on the other, could lead to the outbreak of a new 
war. The opposition is not strong enough for this, he believes. 
  However, there is no doubt that the development of events in 
such a scenario will only lead to an escalation of hostilities. 
  Moscow faces a choice: Either condemn its small military 
contingent in Tajikistan to further casualties, or increase its 
military presence, which risks inevitable embroilment in another 
war. 
  Moscow is therefore forcing a start to political dialogue 
between the Tajik authorities and the Islamic opposition. To 
this end Anatoliy Adamishin, Russian first deputy foreign 
minister, has paid a lightning visit to Dushanbe. 
  It has taken Moscow just over a year of effort for a Russian 
diplomat finally to be able to declare: The Tajik leadership 
has displayed its goodwill and expressed its readiness to embark 
on talks with the opposition. 
  This is apparently a reference to the most moderate section 
of the representatives of the Islamic movement. It is planned 
to hold talks under the auspices of the United Nations. These 
talks could be held in Moscow. In which case the Russian side 
would be prepared to undertake to resolve organizational 
problems. If the talks break down, the blame, according to 
Adamishin, would lie not with Russia or Tajikistan but with the 
opposition, which, in the diplomat's words, "could turn nasty." 
  In a year that has seen no political dialogue whatsoever, 
the 
demands of the opponents of the Dushanbe authorities have grown 
much more exacting. It is symptomatic that the Islamic 
opposition leaders are inclining toward Tehran as the most 
acceptable place for them to hold talks. They are clearly 
hoping for Iranian support and consequently the support of 
orthodox Muslims in their upcoming dialogue with Moscow and 
Dushanbe.

  [Text] Moscow, 7 Mar -- Within the framework of the Russian 
diplomatic initiatives undertaken on the instructions of 
President Boris Yeltsin in connection with the sharp 
deterioration in the situation in the Middle East, First Deputy 
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov received the ambassadors of the 
United States, Israel, Egypt, and Lebanon and the charges 
d'affaires of Syria and Jordan at the Russian Foreign Ministry 
on 6 and 7 March. Igor Ivanov informed them of efforts by the 
Russian Foreign Ministry and Minister Andrey Kozyrev at this 
crucial moment. 
  He described in detail the main results of his own recent 
mission to Tunisia and Israel, where he had meetings with Yasir 
'Arafat, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, and Foreign Affairs 
Minister Shim'on Peres. The diplomats were told that, in light 
of the present situation in the region following the Hebron 
tragedy, Russia is implementing urgent measures aimed at 
preventing an escalation of the violence and at preserving and 
resuming the Middle East peace talks. It was this angle that 
was taken at the talks in Tunis and Tel Aviv. The participants 
focused on such important issues as the UN Security Council 
adoption of an effective resolution aimed at guaranteeing the 
safety of the civilian Palestinian population in the occupied 
territories, an international presence there as an additional 
means to guarantee the population's safety, and also new 
measures and steps to promote the resumption of the Arab-Israeli 
dialogue. 
  During the meeting with ambassadors, Russia reaffirmed its 
resolute intention, as co-sponsor, to continue its vigorous 
efforts toward an improvement in the situation in the occupied 
territories and the urgent resumption of talks. In this 
connection, a willingness was expressed to maintain the closest 
of contacts with all interested parties with the aim of tackling 
the main task that unites them all -- namely, the establishment 
of a comprehensive and stable peace in the Middle East.

  [Text] Baku March 7 TASS -- Azerbaijan will never accept 
humiliating terms of peace in the Karabakh war, Azerbaijani 
Parliament Chairman Rasul Kuliyev said. 
  The announcement was made during his meeting with Russian 
Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin who made a stopover 
in Baku on his way from Tehran. 
  Adamishin told the AZERTAC news agency that his talks with 
Kuliyev focused on ways to settle the Karabakh conflict. He 
stressed that Russia favours Azerbaijan's territorial integrity 
and calls for the withdrawal of Armenian troops from all 
occupied lands and the return of refugees. 
  Speaking about the future political status of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, the Russian diplomat said that this issue 
needs further consideration. It can be solved only after the 
war is over, all troops are withdrawn from the occupied 
territory and the blockade is lifted, he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Igor Gukovskiy: "A Suit for President Is Ready, </F>
But Whom Will It Fit Best?"] 
  [Text] The issue of presidency in Belarus that was 
heatedly debated for a long time seems to have been resolved 
now. The Constitution's provisions on the parliament and 
presidency was passed by 266 legislative votes, exceeding the 
required 233 votes, which is two-thirds of the Supreme Soviet. 
As members of the Counting Commission reported at the press 
conference, election of the first Belarusian president should be 
expected not later than 26 June this year. 
  Curiously, several days before the voting, the Belarusian 
Popular Movement [BND] leadership, which has repeatedly said 
that it could block any issue, came out against the presidency. 
Why did they vote for it then? Observers say that there could 
be three reasons for this. First, the NDB altered its position 
in the last minute. Second, it has been concealing its true 
position until now. Third, the movement's members have failed 
to obey decisions made by its leadership. Incidentally, a 
leader of an organization that is part of the NDB denounced the 
voting by NDB members, especially its communist faction, as 
insubordination to the leadership, and suggested applying party 
disciplinary measures. 
  Immediately after the vote, our correspondent met with three 
people's deputies and asked them to answer several questions 
connected with the introduction of a new power institution in 
the Republic. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] Can one be absolutely positive that Belarus 
will 
have its president? 
  [Dmitriy Bulakhov] We have passed the most difficult stage 
in 
introducing the presidency in the Republic. This does not mean, 
however, that it is a foregone conclusion. Ahead lies the 
adoption of the constitution as a whole, and debates over 
transition provisions on its activation, which are very complex 
issues. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] Are you for the presidency? 
  [Bulakhov] Absolutely. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] How would you explain your position? 
  [Bulakhov] Weakness of the power results in the power of 
violence -- uncontrolled and executed not according to laws and 
the Constitution, but according to muscle. This means a 
language of ultimatum and pressure on any procedure. So, it is 
better to have stronger power. This can only be possible when 
two conditions are met: legitimacy supported by a popular vote 
in general elections, and the lawfulness stemming from laws and 
the Constitution. 
  As a matter of fact, the presidency is not a new thing for 
us. Except for the past three years, it has always been present 
in Belarus. We had our presidents in the face of first 
secretaries of the CPSU Central Committee, only we did not talk 
about this. For all its notoriety, the one-party system was 
manageable even during the most crucial and difficult stages of 
economic and political development. 
  What we have today is a general lack of responsibility, or, 
to put it another way, a mess -- and not the pinnacle of 
democracy as some make it out to be. Democracy is not 
ochlocracy. Democracy is when everyone abides by the law, and 
everyone understands that their rights and freedom are limited 
by the rights and freedoms of others. At the same time, an 
individual should have priority over any national and 
supranational rights and freedoms of a group of individuals. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] Will you run for the presidency? 
  [Bulakhov] I am too young now. And, as a matter of fact, 
it's not my business. No, I will not run. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] How realistic is the outcome that a new 
president will be elected by the parliament, as an exception, 
and not by all the people? 
  [Valeriy Tikhinya] This outcome should not be ruled out. 
However, the candidate who will seek this post and the forces 
that he represents will hardly accept it -- because it is so 
obvious that it is going to be a puppet president without strong 
power. As his legal status will be diminished, he will have to 
look to the Supreme Soviet all the time, which gave him its 
support. In my opinion, it is not the best way to elect the 
first Belarusian president, and I hope it will be rejected. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] Will you propose yourself as a candidate for 
president and, if so, as a candidate of what party? 
  [Aleksandr Lukashenko] If I will, I will be a candidate of 
the left center. Basically, all the candidates are already 
known: Lukashenko, Kebich, and perhaps Hryb and Tikhinya -- left 
of the center; Shushkevich, Karpenko, Paznyak -- right of the 
center. Other candidates also may appear. But I do not think 
it's very likely -- political figures do not come out of the 
blue. For me, the arrangement of forces is already clear.

  5. That the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry be 
instructed to perform work to allocate additional posts for 
Russian officers in the UN protection forces staffs in the

  6. That it be recommended to the Russian Federation 
Government that it coordinate the actions of various departments 
and galvanize their work to finally resolve the Bosnian crisis 
by political means. 
  7. That the Federation Council commission for questions of 
security and defense be instructed to monitor the execution of 
this decree.

  In his words, the winter was fairly calm in Tajikistan. 
There was no starvation, factories reopened, prices began to

On the other hand, the commander thought, the struggle for

  Pyankov predicted that as mountain passes opened in the

  He said that tactical exercises of CIS forces were staged

<F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 451] </F>
  [Text] Vilnius, March 7, ELTA -- Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu arrived in Lithuania on a state visit on Monday [7 
March]. Iliescu is accompanied by the Romanian state delegation 
including nine people, State Minister Teodor Melescanu and Trade 
Minister Cristian Ionescu among them. 
  Iliescu was greeted by Lithuanian President Algirdas 
Brazauskas at the airport in Vilnius. Lithuanian Foreign 
Minister Povilas Gylys, Finance Minister Eduardas Vilkelis, 
Communications and Informatics Minister Gintautas Zintelis, 
Trade and Industry Minister Kazimieras Klimasauskas, Ambassador 
Justas Paleckis and Romanian Charge d'Affaires in Lithuania 
Nicolae Craciunas were present during the meeting ceremony at 
the airport. 
  From the airport the high-ranking officials went to 
Antakalnis cemetry. Iliescu put flowers at the memorial for the 
defenders of Lithuania's freedom. 
  In the Houses of Seimas [parliament] both the presidents had 
a half an hour lasting talk behind the closed doors. 
  Both the delegations, headed by their state leaders, had a 
meeting at the President's Office. 
  After the meeting Brazauskas was interviewed by Lithuanian 
and Romanian journalists and said that issues of foreign 
policies and internal affairs of the both countries were 
discussed during the meetings. He emphasized that the two 
countries had many similarities -- they had to solve problems in 
economy and privatisation. Brazauskas noted that the countries 
pursued the similar foreign policy. For example, both the 
countries preferred good relations with neighbouring states, 
Brazauskas said. 
  Talking about Lithuanian economy Brazauskas noted that 
Lithuania had increased its export to the Central and Western 
European countries. He emphasized the aim of the three Baltic 
countries to achieve close cooperation and to become independent 
from the import of raw materials from the east. Brazauskas 
expressed a hope that Romanian businessmen who came to Lithuania 
together with their president would find their Lithuanian 
business partners. 
  Iliescu noted that Lithuania and Romania were related by 
their common wish to establish good relations with their 
neighbouring countries and prevent them from becoming new 
centres of political tension in Europe. Iliescu talked about 
cooperation between Romania and Hungaria and Moldova. He 
admitted that Romania was particurlarly interested in the 
solving of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. He expressed 
a hope that the important problems for both the countries would 
be discussed at the Krans Montana Forum in Bucharest in April. 
  Iliescu and members of the Romanian delegation also met with 
Seimas Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas and other officials. A dinner 
was given in the honour of Iliescu. During the dinner 
Brazauskas said: " Relations between Romania and Lithuania have 
got a new impulse - the visit led to signing the agreements 
between the two countries, the political agreement among them. 
These are the first steps of the close cooperation between 
Romania and Lithuania".

"Conversion Has Begun in Earnest in Moscow, It Seems"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- At a joint sitting of the Moscow 
Government and the board of the Russian Federation State 
Committee for the Defense Sectors of Industry, a draft decree 
"On the `Conversion for the City' Regional Program for the 
Conversion of Moscow Region Defense Enterprises" was approved on 
the whole. 
  On the proposal of Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, who did not 
conceal his negative attitude toward privatization 
"Chubays-style," a supplement concerning the flotation of the 
capital's "defense sector" was excluded from the draft. Yuriy 
Luzhkov stated that Moscow requires particular terms and methods 
for denationalizing industrial enterprises. As for financing 
the program, according to the premier's assurances, at least 147 
billion rubles will be made available in 1994.

<F P=106> [Report by Ihar Sinyakevich: "Belarusian Pipelines Could Be </F>
Sold to Russia for the Price of One House?"] 
  [Text] The Belarusian Government forwarded an agreement on 
joining the Russian Joint Stock Association "GAZPROM" by the 
Belarusian state enterprise for gas delivery "BELTRANSHAZ" for 
ratification by the Belarusian Supreme Soviet. According to the 
agreement that was signed by Belarusian and Russian prime 
ministers on 8 September 1993, along with the agreement on the 
unification of their monetary systems, Belarus receives 
valuables of the "BELTRANSHAZ," the entire property of which is 
handed over to the statute capital of the Russian Joint Stock 
Association "GAZPROM." The cost of the "BELTRANSHAZ" property 
was assessed at 1.2 billion rubles [R] as of 1 January 1993. 
Land belonging to the Belarusian gas industry is being leased 
to Russian "GAZPROM" for 99 years. The agreement also states: 
"The Republic of Belarus guarantees that the property -- which 
is being handed over to Russia on the basis of the agreement -- 
and "GAZPROM" investments on the territory of Belarus will not 
undergo confiscation, nationalization, or requisition. The 
Republic of Belarus guarantees free transit of Russian natural 
gas for export." 
  On the other hand, Russia promises to support "GAZPROM" by 
increasing its yearly gas deliveries to Belarusian consumers up 
to 21 billion cubic meters in 1995, 26 billion cubic meters in 
2000, and 33 billion cubic meters in 2010. 
  The government's note ratifying this agreement enumerates 
the 
following advantages, which certify the necessity for its 
ratification: Belarus will be guaranteed gas deliveries in the 
amounts required for the national economy; the issues of 
supplying the Belarusian gas industry with spares, pipes, 
insulation and operational materials will be resolved; in 
connection with the increased transit of gas deliveries through 
the Belarusian territory, the state budget of Belarus will 
receive more assets; Belarus will enjoy dividends from the 
activities of "GAZPROM"; the Belarusian construction branch will 
receive orders for $300 million. 
  However, not all were satisfied with the arguments of the 
government. The Supreme Soviet commission for economic reform 
opposed the ratification of this document and demanded 
additional information on the conditions of this deal. This is 
what People's Deputy Leanid Kozik, chairman of the commission, 
said: "I oppose the ratification of this agreement. This is my 
and our commission's opinion. We do not see anything beneficial 
from this agreement: Neither what the costs of the main 
"BELTRANSHAZ" funds are, nor how many securities the Belarusian 
party will receive. According to the figures cited in the 
press, I calculated that Belarus will have 0.5 percent. The 
cost of Belarusian gas pipelines and pumping stations were 
assessed at R1.2 billion. I calculated that the cost of the 
metal for these pipelines alone is much higher. I wrote a 
resolution that as long as we have no exact figures, and as long 
as I do not see what this means for the Republic, I am not going 
to initial this document." 
  Could you propose any alternative to cooperation between the 
"BELTRANSHAZ" and the "GAZPROM?" 
  "In principle, I am not against the setting up of a joint 
stock company. However, the documents should be properly 
formulated, so that one party would not take everything away 
from the other. Because after joining the joint stock company, 
we will have only securities while the property will belong to 
the other party. According to the Russian and Belarusian laws on 
joint stock companies, in case of withdrawing from a joint stock 
company, we cannot claim back our property, it will be possible 
to sell only the securities. I do not oppose the joint stock 
companies, but it is necessary to properly assess the property 
and the expenses of the Republic, because later, Russia will 
continue exporting its gas to the West, however, free of charge. 
  Poland chose to set up a joint stock company with the 
"GAZPROM...." 
  "There could be other variants if the property belongs to 
us. 
The main aim is that Belarus does not lose." 
  What do you think? Will the legislature ratify this 
agreement? 
  "I will categorically oppose it. I do not think that 
deputies will believe this note without seeing the figures, and 
will distribute our property without any reasons for doing this." 
  Other deputies also spoke about their negative attitude 
toward this agreement. The issue is not only that of the low 
costs of the "BELTRANSHAZ." According to some assessments, if 
we sell the state property based on its balance costs, then one 
U.S. billionaire could buy all the property of the Republic of 
Belarus. It is not worth selling such strategic objects as 
pipelines at their real, market price because the Republic will 
lose not only its property forever, but its opportunity to 
affect Russia through the market. It is a very dangerous step if 
we take into consideration that Belarus depends on Russia in 
many aspects.

  [Text] As BELAPAN has learned, the government, the 
Federation of Belarusian Trade Unions [FPB], and the Union of 
Employers have signed the general agreement for 1994. A draft 
of this document has recently been examined by the Belarusian 
Cabinet of Ministers Economics Department. The main 
disagreement between the government and trade unions regarding 
this draft, concerned the proportions between the minimum wage 
and the minimum consumer basket. Nevertheless, as Viktar 
Talstakoraw, chief of the FPB Department of Organization and 
Remuneration of Labor, told BELAPAN, the following compromise 
was reached on this issue: The proportions between the minimum 
wage and the minimum consumer budget should be reexamined 
according to the results of the first six months of 1994. The 
three sides also agreed that it is necessary to constantly 
control the implementation of the general agreement. Control 
was entrusted to the Belarusian Arbitrary Council for Labor and 
Social Issues that includes representatives of the government, 
the FPB, and the Employers Union. The council is to hold its 
meetings every three months. As Viktar Talstakoraw pointed out, 
this year's general agreement distinguishes itself as "more 
specific and directed."

<F P=106> [Vladimir Klimov report: "NATO: Hawk or Dove? How the </F>
North Atlantic Alliance Is Transforming Itself"] 
  [Text] He is married with three sons. He likes reading, 
singing, and drawing. He goes skating and yachting. A brief 
sketch of the private life of...no, not of a flourishing 
representative of the bohemian way of life, nor of a rich heir. 
We are talking about NATO's number three -- General John 
Waters, deputy supreme commander in chief of NATO Joint Armed 
Forces in Europe. 
  My meeting with him took place at the M.V. Frunze Military 
Academy. Gen. Waters had come to Moscow to lecture on the 
transformation of NATO, the change in the strategic concept of 
the North Atlantic alliance, and its future role. 
  A new page in NATO's history was opened in November 1991. 
The heads of state and government of the NATO member countries 
issued the Declaration on Peace and Cooperation. What did this 
mean? Nothing less than the end of the "cold war." 
  However, Gen. Waters believes that when the threat of a 
major 
war disappeared, petty conflicts being to flare up more 
frequently, mainly over ethnic disagreements. How are they to 
be averted, and how is regional peace and stability to be 
consolidated? These are the questions facing NATO leaders 
today. It was to resolve these issues that the "Partnership for 
Peace" initiative was born. Gen. Waters said that he is not a 
politician but a soldier, and, for him, this initiative means 
only one thing -- the capacity to act jointly to consolidate 
peace in regions of confrontation. Armed forces may be required 
in these conditions, but their direct employment depends on the 
circumstances arising on the ground. In the main, servicemen 
will fulfill other functions in conflict regions: protecting 
people from starvation, providing them with humanitarian and 
medical aid, and rescuing people during natural disasters. 
  As a whole the North Atlantic alliance's strategic concept 
is 
defined by a broader approach to security, an approach based on 
dialogue, cooperation, and maintaining the capacity for 
collective defense. This concept also envisages substantial 
changes in NATO's Joint Armed Forces. 
  The goal has changed, and the means of achieving it are also 
changing. THe new structure of the armed forces, whose 
formation will be completed in 1995, assigns the major role to 
multinational formations. They will be provided to support UN 
or CSCE peacekeeping missions. 
  The reconstruction of the NATO Armed Forces entails their 
reduction by 25 percent by 1997. The main reduction will be in 
the ground forces. In NATO's central region the reduction will 
be 45 percent. True, at the same time the number of reserve 
units will be somewhat increased. 
  So, what will the North Atlantic alliance become now, an 
alliance which in the old Soviet history was never called 
anything but aggressive and hawkish? However substantive the 
changes in the NATO Armed Forces, it is clear that these forces 
will still be sufficiently powerful, and the hawk's claws and 
beak have by no means been blunted. 
  The most obvious illustration of this is the former 
Yugoslavia and the current crisis in Bosnia. Gen. Waters was 
asked how the decision on air strikes against the Serbs was 
arrived at. He explained at length the so-called two-shoulder 
method, which boils down to the adoption of first and foremost a 
political decision at the highest international level on the 
basis of specific proposals from the military leadership on the 
ground. With evident relief the general acknowledged that this 
decision is now the property of history. 
  He gave due credit to the Russian peacekeeping battalion, 
which managed to complete its march to Sarajevo in difficult 
conditions. The combat training of Russian soldiers is of a high 
standard, the general remarked.

  [Text] Geneva, 8 March -- "Developing countries and states 
must not be left on their own to cope with their difficulties on 
the path of the creation of democratic societies." This was 
stated today in an address at the 50th daily session of the UN 
Commission on Human Rights by the head of the Russian 
delegation, the human rights representative of the Russian 
Federation Sergey Kovalev. After stressing that "Russia, too, is 
facing plenty of transition period problems and difficulties," 
he thanked countries and international organizations which had 
sent observers to the parliamentary elections and the referendum 
on the new Constitution of the Russian Federation for their 
assistance. 
  The Russian representative said that "fruitful contacts" had 
been established with the Council of Europe, the Center for 
Human Rights [as heard], the United States, the European 
countries, and Australia. More than 30 non-government 
organizations, including "Amnesty International" and "Helsinki 
Watch," had opened missions in the Russian Federation. "We 
welcome in every possible way intervention of this kind in 
Russia's internal affairs and believe that the more vigorous and 
the more large-scale it is, the more hopes and guarantees there 
will be that the internal life of Russian society will change 
for the better." 
  "We hope that our partners will not be indifferent to a 
problem which is so painful for Russians like the situation of 
their compatriots in the countries which previously were part of 
the Soviet Union, including Latvia and Estonia. Not only 
Russia's democratic future, but also the fate of many states 
which were formed after the break-up of the USSR, and in the 
final analysis, international peace and security, depend on how 
timely and clear their voice is." 
  After touching on the situation in the Yugoslav conflict 
zone, Sergey Kovalev stressed that the presence of Russian 
soldiers and officers in Sarajevo is "an example of Russia's 
sincere interest in a peaceful settlement of the crisis in 
former Yugoslavia." Russian servicemen had come to the Bosnian 
capital in order to "prevent further suffering and death in this 
town." He warned against an unbalanced approach towards the 
Yugoslav crisis and attempts to blame one of the conflicting 
sides for everything, "to play down the crimes by one side and 
to indulge yet another side." Inevitably such an approach "will 
hamper the possibility of a peaceful settlement of the conflict 
and will undermine trust in the Commission on Human Rights." 
  The address voiced concern at the situation in the human 
rights sphere in Iraq, Iran, Myanmar, and Afghanistan. "So far 
the problem of the release of former servicemen has not been 
resolved," the head of the delegation said. "Some Afghanistani 
politicians are continuing to block this issue. Our position is 
that the problem of prisoners of war is of a strictly 
humanitarian nature and needs to be solved immediately and 
without linkage to any conditions whatsoever." 
  "We are disappointed by the lack of progress in ensuring 
human rights in Cuba, for whose people Russia has the warmest 
feelings," Sergey Kovalev said. "We call on the Cuban 
authorities to ensure democratic rights and freedoms and also to 
establish cooperation with the Commission's special rapporteur." 
  After recalling that at the 48th session of the Commission 
on 
Human Rights the Russian delegation "had raised the issue of the 
arbitrariness of the state bodies of North Korea vis-a-vis DPRK 
citizens at timber procurement enterprises in Russia," he said 
that "at the Russian side's initiative the bilateral agreement 
between Russian and the DPRK on cooperation in the sphere of 
timber procurement, in spite of considerable financial 
advantages, had been cancelled." In future such an agreement is 
possible only "given the observance of the rights and freedoms 
of the individual and the respect of Russian legislation."

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 08, BNS -- The Lithuanian-Romanian 
political treaty indicates the significance of the first visit 
to Lithuania by a Romanian leader after the restoration of 
Lithuanian independence, Romanian President Ion Iliescu said at 
a press conference after the accord was signed in Vilnius 
Tuesday [8 March]. 
  The agreement on friendship and cooperation was signed by 
Iliescu and Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas. 
Agreements on investment protection and promotion, and 
commercial cooperation in 1994 were signed by Lithuanian 
Industry and Trade Minister Kazimieras Klimasauskas and Romanian 
Trade Minister Cristian Ionescu. 
  "The signing of the friendship and cooperation treaty with 
Romania expands Lithuania's relations with Black sea countries," 
the Lithuanian president said. 
  In his words, Lithuania uses every opportunity to improve 
its 
ties with both "next-door" and more distant neighbors. 
Lithuania and Romania should make use of their geographical 
location to strengthen economic and commercial relations, he 
said. 
  Iliescu said Romania welcomes every initiative that enhances 
security and stability. The Romanian leader said a positive 
thing is that security zones are created around both the Baltic 
and the Black sea, but it is "hard to speak" about a union of 
these zones. 
  Both presidents said their countries pay much attention to 
safeguarding security. Brazauskas pointed out that both 
countries signed up for NATO's Partnership for Peace program. 
The Lithuanian president expressed hope that Russia will join 
the program in the near future. "The problem of creating blocs 
in Europe would then disappear," he said. 
  In Iliescu's words, Lithuania and Romania seek to join 
different European and international cooperation structures, and 
"this should not be hindered by any economic or political 
barriers." 
  Commenting on the commercial cooperation agreement, Minister 
Klimasauskas said it is very democratic, allowing to choose 
goods and to set prices without any restrictions. 
  The Romanian delegation completes its two-day visit to 
Lithuania Tuesday. Before departure, Iliescu will visit Vilnius 
University.

Seimas National Security Committee; National Defense Minister 
Linas Linkevicius; officials from the Ministry of National 
Defense; and representatives from the Voluntary Defense Service. 
  The guests will also visit the port of Klaipeda where they 
will inspect the flotilla of the Lithuanian marine force. The 
main sphere of cooperation between the Lithuanian and Danish 
military structures is the training of officers of this country. 
Another sphere is partnership for peace. Denmark will help the 
Baltic states to set up peacekeeping military units. They are 
already introducing their methodology and giving assistance for 
the training of servicemen. It is thought that the first 
Lithuanian peacekeeping unit will leave for former Yugoslavia, 
together with the Danish battalion. 
  Experts from Denmark are expected to arrive at the end of 
March. They will assess the Alytus military base where the joint 
peacekeeping unit of the Baltic states is to be trained. 
  A treaty will be signed by the Danish and Lithuanian defense 
ministers during the visit. This will reinforce further the 
links between the two state institutions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas by </F>
Ruta Grineviciute in Vilnius on 24 February: "A. Brazauskas: I 
Seek Concord and a Better Life for Lithuanian People"] 
  [Excerpts] Exactly one year ago, on 25 February 1993, A. 
Brazauskas became Lithuania's fourth president after taking the 
oath of office at the Seimas [parliament]. On the eve of his 
first anniversary in office, A. Brazauskas answered several 
questions from RESPUBLIKA reporter R. Grineviciute. 
  [Grineviciute] When taking the oath as president, you stated 
that you would be just to everyone. Is it easy to fulfill this 
promise? 
  [Brazauskas] It is not easy, but I am trying to do my best. 
I think that I have freed myself from the influence of 
different political forces over this year. I cannot claim, 
however, that someone used to exert particular influence over me 
earlier. 
  [Grineviciute] According to the Constitution, you will 
"outlive" the current Seimas by two years. Do you expect to 
have support from the parliamentary majority after the next 
Seimas elections? 
  [Brazauskas] The Seimas might "outlive" me. If people follow 
the same logic in the next elections, the Seimas will remain 
moderate. I believe that there will be no such surprises as in 
October 1992 (when the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party won a 
majority -- R.G.). 
  [Grineviciute] You claim that you have freed yourself from 
political influences. Have there been any decisions causing 
protests from the Seimas majority over that time? 
  [Brazauskas] There have been no such reprimands. However, 
there have been some misunderstandings, because I did not sign 
several laws adopted by the Seimas majority. 
  [Grineviciute] You mentioned in your annual report that you 
did not see any qualitative changes among officials. Meanwhile, 
the prime minister has repeatedly said that he will not conduct 
reform in the state management. How do you intend to resolve 
this conflict? 
  [Brazauskas] We maintain that we must preserve stable 
government institutions in terms of their organization. 
However, the problem is their contents -- officials. We have 
inherited the current conditions, and we have not yet defined an 
official's status. However, the Seimas will resolve this issue 
and legalize officials in the better sense of this word by 
adopting a relevant law in March. 
  [Grineviciute] How can corruption be "treated?" 
  [Brazauskas] If such a cure existed, the entire world would 
be free of corruption. This is a common misfortune of all 
government officials. I have repeatedly said that cases of 
corruption must be assessed at courts. I have never defended 
and will not defend a single official who abuses his position. 
  [Grineviciute] What is your key goal as president? What will 
allow you to say -- "My presence was not fruitless?" 
  [Brazauskas] I dream about normal relations among the 
Lithuanian people. The last year shows that they can be 
achieved. Neither I nor the government or the Seimas increase 
tension. As long as I am here, I will try to prevent people's 
artificial opposition. 
  Another of my goals is a better life for the Lithuanian 
people. We can speak about the absence of a concept, but all our 
efforts must be directed at this. [passage omitted] 
  [Grineviciute] How do you assess the now concluding 
negotiations on the treaty with Poland? 
  [Brazauskas] Since I have participated in drafting the 
treaty 
over the past six months, I claim that the desire of both sides 
to find an acceptable solution has prevailed.

<F P=106> [Article by Audrius Baciulis: "Diplomatic Masterpieces"] </F>
  [Text] The press used to report extensively on our Foreign 
Minister P. Gylys' diplomatic "skills" at one time. He did not 
escape the attention of the Seimas [parliament] as well. 
Although the minister remained in office, he stated arrogantly 
as usual that the operation "fall" [opposition's no-confidence 
vote] directed against him had failed, and that he had to 
withdraw from active political life. Judging by certain signs, 
the key workload has been transferred to Deputy Minister A. 
Januska, while the minister has confined himself to protocol 
visits. (For example, he is planning to go to a conference of 
European Union associate members, although it is not yet clear 
what he intends to do there -- probably, to show himself and 
look at others.) 
  However, only the minister himself can perform certain 
diplomatic functions. For example, to convey a protest to an 
ambassador of a neighboring country, particularly if one of its 
trains, loaded with enough armored vehicles to accommodate a 
battalion, crosses the Lithuanian border. Not only did Russia 
fail to inform anyone of such a military transit, but the 
vehicles (this time empty) were accompanied by armed Russian 
soldiers. 
  Under normal diplomatic circumstances such actions are 
called 
armed provocations. Upon learning such facts, the government 
immediately summons the ambassador of the provocating state to 
the Foreign Ministry and expresses a harsh protest, regardless 
of the time of day or night. 
  How did the Lithuanian foreign minister behave under such 
circumstances? The train with armored vehicles crossed the 
Lithuanian border on Saturday [19 February]. The Foreign 
Ministry managed to summon the Russian ambassador only on 
Tuesday. Instead of expressing a harsh protest, P. Gylys 
requested (!) that Russia observe the rules of transit in the 
future. According to our foreign minister, this Russian 
provocation was only an "unpleasant incident." The minister 
even managed to find some "positive tendencies" -- it turns out 
that servicemen are leaving Kaliningrad Oblast rather than 
entering it, as though there was a shortage of soldiers in 
Uznemune [reference to Lithuanian territory lying between the 
Nemunas river and Kaliningrad Oblast]. 
  One may only guess what P. Gylys lacked on Tuesday -- the 
courage to lodge a protest with Russia or a simple knowledge of 
diplomatic rules. The minister may have simply forgotten how 
the chief diplomat of an independent state should behave in such 
cases....

<F P=106> [Report from Stockholm by Audrius Braukyla] </F>
  [Text] Government leaders of the three Baltic states have 
decided to step up cooperation in the security field. This was 
reported by Linas Linkevicius, minister of national defense, 
after a meeting with Valdis Birkavs and Mart Laar in the Latvian 
Embassy in Stockholm yesterday afternoon. According to Linas 
Linkevicius, it has been agreed to coordinate at top 
governmental level the issues of airspace and border control of 
the Baltic states. 
  The minister of national defense also pointed out that the 
Lithuanian delegation bound themselves at the meeting to prepare 
a draft treaty of the states on the peace-keeping battalion. 
  During the meeting negotiations were held by the leaders of 
the three governments on the development of the Lithuanian, 
Latvian, and Estonian power engineering system. In this 
respect, according to Linas Linkevicius, his conversation with 
Danish Prime Minister Poul Rasmussen yesterday was worth 
mentioning. They talked about the possibility of the Baltic 
states tapping into the gas supply system of the Nordic states. 
  According to the leader of the Lithuanian delegation, the 
Danish prime minister would regard positively the possibility of 
supplying gas to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia from Denmark. 
  Much attention at the meeting was given to the problem of 
speeding up the negotiations between Russia and Latvia and 
Estonia. Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar told Lithuanian Radio 
that his country feels strong support from Lithuania on issues 
concerning the withdrawal of Russian troops. Mart Laar believes 
that in the future, when the Russian troops have been withdrawn 
from Latvia and Estonia, one of the greatest problems for the 
security of the Baltic states may be the large concentration of 
Russian troops deployed in the Kaliningrad region and the 
question of their transit. 
  At the moment the delegations from the governments of the 
Baltic states are taking part in debates currently under way at 
the session of the Council of Ministers of the Nordic States.

  [Text] Russia wants military transit through Lithuania to 
be carried out by rail and road and by air transport. This was 
noted by Virgilijus Bulovas, the head of the Lithuanian working 
group for negotiations with the CIS countries, in an interview 
with Lithuanian television, where he commented on a draft 
agreement on military transit received recently from Russia. 
  As already reported, the negotiating group adopted a 
decision 
at its meeting that the draft submitted by Russia could be 
examined only after the Lithuanian Seimas passes a law on the 
transportation of military and dangerous loads through the 
territory of Lithuania. Bulovas noted that, in the opinion of 
Lithuanian experts, only military transit by rail can be 
discussed. Transit by road would be unacceptable to Lithuania; 
separate international regulations exist for air transport and 
permits for flights must be obtained at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs. In the opinion of Bulovas, Lithuania therefore cannot 
sign a separate agreement on military transit with Russia. 
Regulations are the same for all countries, whether it is NATO 
or Russia, said the head of the working group. 
  According to him, the working group is at present preparing 
regulations for the transportation of dangerous loads by rail 
through the territory of Lithuania. In addition, Bulovas noted, 
Lithuania has no two borders with Russia. Therefore it will be 
necessary to conclude either a tripartite agreement among 
Russia, Belarus, and Lithuania, or three separate bilateral 
agreements. Bulovas also noted that Russia has been lately 
making an extensive use of sea transit. According to him, this 
is confirmed by the fact that there are fewer transportations by 
rail than planned.

  [Text] Vilnius, March 8, ELTA -- Lithuanian working group 
for negotiations with CIS countries had a meeting at the Foreign 
Ministry on Tuesday [8 March]. The group discussed the issues 
of legalization of transit regulations. 
  The group made a conclusion that common regulations on the 
dangerous and military transit through Lithuanian territory for 
all the countries should be established in accordance with the 
international conventions. They decided to form a group of 
experts which would draft a law on dangerous and military 
transit through Lithuanian territory. 
  The working group also got acquainted with the draft on 
transit presented by Russia and decided that it could be 
considered just after Seimas [parliament] enacted the law on 
transit.

ELTA it denied a wrong information published in the daily 
"LIETUVOS RYTAS" (March 2, 1994) about Lithuanian-French 
military co-operation. 
  The embassy said that in January, 1993, French authorities 
presented Lithuanian Army a great amount of military technique 
[as received] and paid all its shipping expenses. The gifts 
included one complete field hospital similar to those now used 
by the French Army in former Yugoslavia as well as 
communications equipment, not the most modern but still used in 
some French gendarmerie units and possible to use in a case of a 
possible mobilization. 
  The embassy also said 30 jeeps used for four years and 
technically in order with spare parts had been presented. Last 
November, a delegation of French technicians had visited 
Lithuania seeking to arrange one more package of spare parts.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 04, BNS -- Members of the Lithuanian 
parliament's National Security Committee blame their colleague 
for revealing "a state secret." 
  As previously reported, the LIETUVOS RYTAS newspaper on 
Wednesday [2 March] published an article about armaments used by 
the Lithuanian field army. The report was based on information 
provided by MP Kestutis Gaska, who is a member of the committee 
and recently left the parliamentary faction of the ruling 
Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP]. 
  In the opinion of some other committee members, the 
information published by the newspaper is a state secret. 
  Vytautas Petkevicius, chairman of the committee, told the 
LIETUVOS AIDAS newspaper that he would not provide any such 
information to the press and described Gaska as an "emotional" 
lawmaker with a "great imagination." The committee chairman, who 
is a member of the ruling LDDP faction, said "you cannot put 
handcuffs on him and you cannot stop him from talking." 
  But in Petkevicius' opinion, Gaska's critical remarks about 
the quality of the army equipment donated by some foreign 
countries are correct. 
  LIETUVOS RYTAS, referring to Gaska's words, said the 30 
jeeps 
that were donated by the French government are meant for a 
tropical climate and can be used in Lithuania only 3 or 4 months 
a year. 
  On Thursday, the French embassy in Vilnius circulated a 
press 
release saying that "it would be a pity if polemics based on 
erroneous information would cast a shadow on military 
cooperation between France and Lithuania." 
  The embassy said the jeeps were still used by the French 
army 
only four years ago and denied that they are meant only for hot 
climatic conditions. 
  Petkevicius said he personally attended the ceremony during 
which the jeeps were handed over to Lithuania and it "would have 
been impolite not to accept them." He noted, however, that the 
jeeps were made in 1942, they use 27 liters of gasoline per 100 
kilometers and can only "be sold to a museum of antiques." 
  Petkevicius is also very skeptical about the automatic 
rifles 
from Israel which are suitable "not to shoot but to sow 
bullets." LIETUVOS AIDAS quotes the lawmaker as saying that 
donated batteries for communication equipment are also old and 
should have been "buried in the ground" back were they came from.

<F P=106> [Report by Ruta Skatikaite: "Local Rather Than Seimas </F>
Deputies Are Concerned With the Ignalina Plant"] 
  [Text] Having demanded information about the planned 
construction of a monstrous storage site for radioactive waste, 
local deputies expressed their doubt in the need for such a 
facility two and a half years ago. This affected energy 
specialists who later abandoned this outdated project. Ignalina 
deputies are now concerned with choosing a site for containers 
of radioactive fuel. Participants in a 23 February meeting of 
local deputies with Energy Deputy Minister S. Kutas and V. 
Shevaldin, director of the Ignalina nuclear power plant, 
discussed the expediency of enlarging the area of the 
radioactive waste storage yard in Lithuania. Are imports of 
radioactive waste -- which bring only modest income to energy 
workers and leave the most dangerous source of radiation in 
Lithuania for centuries -- permissible? Why has the foundation 
for managing the nuclear plant after its closure not yet been 
established, even though the plant has 10-15 years of operation 
remaining? Why are research studies about the concentration of 
radioactive materials in the air, water, and soil not 
publicized? Why are the health of people living near the 
Ignalina plant and the possible changes in their bodies not 
examined? 
  Since the energy minister has not submitted any definite 
proposals concerning the future of the nuclear station, local 
deputies protest against the increase in radioactive waste on 
their territory. Moreover, they are interested in benefits for 
people living within a 30-km radius of the plant. They also 
demand that bonuses for discomfort be paid not only to employees 
of budget organizations, but also to all inhabitants. 
  Deputies will also adopt a final decision at their session 
in 
mid-March.

  [Excerpt] The second power unit at the Ignalina power 
station was put back into operation last night. 
  Genadiy Negrivoda, chief engineer at the nuclear power 
station, told the Baltic News Service correspondent that all the 
work was carried out smoothly and according to the planned 
schedule. 
  Today the second power unit is operating with the capacity 
of 
700 MW and the first unit at 1,000 MW. According to Mr. 
Negrivoda this amount of power is sufficient for the needs of 
consumers, therefore, neither of the units is opearting at the 
maximum capacity of 1,300 MW. [Passage omitted] 
  Mr. Negrivoda also said that the first unit of the nuclear 
power station is to be shut down at the beginning of April for 
routine maintenance. 
  This year as a result of minor malfunction the first and the 
second reactors at the Ignalina nuclear station were shut down 
on 18 and 29 of January.

<F P=106> [Report by Ruta Skatikaite on news conference by V. </F>
Shevaldin, director of the Ignalina nuclear power plant, with 
unidentified reporters on 25 February; place not given: 
"Foreign Experts and P. Globa Will Assess the Ignalina AE"] 
  [Text] On Friday [25 February], V. Shevaldin, director of 
the Ignalina nuclear power plant [AE], held a press conference 
in which he told about his recent meetings in Moscow, London, 
and Paris concerning the plant's security. The meetings were 
also attended by representatives of the Lithuanian Energy 
Ministry, the Energy Institute, and the Ignalina AE. The most 
important meeting took place in London where an agreement was 
signed with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
on a 32-million ECU [European currency unit] gift aid for the AE. 
  "The Donors' Council drafted a new agreement on this gift 
aid," said V. Shevaldin, "because Lithuania had not signed the 
draft agreement discussed in December due to its categorical 
demand to shut down one block. The conditions for aid contained 
in the new draft agreement satisfied both Lithuania and the 
Donors' Council. There are two of them: Both blocks at the 
Ignalina AE will be used until the year 2004 according to the 
technical possibilities of the tubes; foreign experts must 
prepare a report on the security of both blocks by 30 July 1995. 
After receiving this report, the State Atomic Energy Inspection 
will consider the matter of issuing a license for the station. 
It is very important that Lithuania retain the right to judge 
whether to issue a license or not." 
  [Reporter] What will the acquired currency be used for? 
  [Shevaldin] We coordinated and approved the scope of work 
with the bank. This work will be performed by companies 
selected through competition. The European Bank has begun to 
organize an international bid on the establishment of a special 
group that will regulate relations with future contractors. 
Seventeen companies from all over the world have expressed the 
desire to participate in the competition. It will be decided 
over the coming days which company will supervise the 
implementation of the project in cooperation with AE specialists. 
  [Reporter] Would you define the key lines financed by the 
European Bank? 
  [Shevaldin] Eighteen lines have been established. Most of 
them are linked with the acquisition of equipment controlling 
the key technological points. There are plans to create radio 
monitoring that would allow receiving constant operative 
information about the radiological state of the plant and its 
environment. Some very important lines are associated with the 
closure of the reactor due to the reduced utilization of water 
in technological tubes, as well as with the design of new 
emergency stoppage systems. It is very pitiable that the 
Donors' Council did not agree to include in the agreement such 
issues concerning the AE security as the acquisition of several 
containers for fuel waste, cementing and processing of 
radioactive resins, and the purchase of a press for solid waste 
with low radioactivity. 
  [Reporter] After your return from the trip, you must have 
read the prophesies of clairvoyant P. Globa about the possible 
accident in the second block. Did this week's unscheduled 
stoppage of this block occur because of this prophesy? 
  [Shevaldin] No, we did not close the second block because of 
Globa's prophesies. We noticed a slight increase in 
radioactivity in an area near the reactor, where one cannot get 
while the block is operating. Since routine two-month repair 
work at the first block begins in a month, we decided to remove 
the fault now in order to avoid the closure of the entire plant. 
I have never said that such prophesies as P. Globa's are 
nonsensical. I myself do not have extrasensory perception 
skills, therefore, I cannot feel things like he does. We have 
requested the nuclear plant in Rovno to send us all relevant 
information, because P. Globa prophesied an accident there as 
well. Moreover, we have written a letter to the clairvoyant 
inviting him to the station and promising to cover all travel 
expenses. There will be nothing bad if we conduct an additional 
inspection of the plant with this man. If he does not arrive, 
we will have to think that he himself does not believe in his 
prophesies, or that he simply does not care about any accident.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 08, BNS -- Summing up the results of 
its work over the past year, the parliamentary faction of the 
ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDLP] said the 
opposition is weak and needs help to become more constructive. 
  The LDLP faction has an absolute majority in the Lithuanian 
parliament - 72 seats out of 140. On Monday [7 March], the 
faction began a series of closed meetings to analyze its own 
activities, as well as the work of the government and the 
opposition. The faction also intends to hold elections of its 
chairman. 
  Although the meetings are closed, the leftist TIESA 
newspaper 
reported several details from a speech made by Justinas Karosas, 
the faction's current chairman. 
  Karosas reportedly said that although the LDLP is a social 
democratic party in a post communist country, it must also 
fulfil non-social democratic tasks because such is the reality. 
  The return to power is both an aim and a means for the 
opposition, he said. In Karosas' opinion, the opposition is 
weak and must be stimulated to make its activities more 
constructive. 
  Discussing the faction's relations with the government, 
Karosas said they are difficult because the government does not 
always want to be controlled by the faction.

<F P=106> ["Appeal of the president of the Republic of Crimea"] </F>
  [Text] Esteemed fellow citizens! 
  The situation in the republic continues to deteriorate and 
has approached a state of crisis. The growth of crime, which is 
threatening the formation and development of our young republic, 
is particularly disturbing. The negative impact of the shadow 
economy is increasing, discipline and order are declining, 
organized crime is growing everywhere, and firearms are being 
used for criminal purposes increasingly often. An emergency 
situation, which demands the adoption of radical measures, has 
taken shape in Crimea. 
  All this is keeping the republic on edge, evoking people's 
alarm and disquiet, creating an atmosphere of unmanageability, 
and engendering irresponsibility and an impermissibly airy, 
nihilistic attitude toward the laws and state discipline. 
  Questions of ensuring elementary order based on conscious 
discipline are taking precedence today in order that everyone 
might have confidence in the present and the future, that there 
might be sufficiency, and that people might cease to fear for 
themselves and their nearest and dearest. Everyone who performs 
his duty conscientiously should be sure that he is under the 
protection of the law and the president. 
  Today I appeal to you, my electorate. Your assistance in 
desisting from ill-considered political steps and unreasoned 
actions, which could destabilize the situation even more. Your 
assistance in helping the law enforcement authorities and in 
creating volunteer formations to safeguard public order and put 
a stop to law-breaking, primarily at the place of residence and 
employment. 
  The current dangerous crime situation cannot be altered 
without there having been a fundamental change in the attitude 
of the outfits of enterprises, the population of cites, 
settlements, and villages, and of the entire community toward 
this matter, which is of vital importance to all. A system of 
measures of moral and material encouragement of the community 
for participation in law enforcement activity and the utmost 
assistance to it on the part of the law enforcement authorities, 
enterprises, and organizations is being created to this end. 
  It is essential that all citizens with unregistered weapons 
immediately turn them in to the internal affairs authorities and 
that, if necessary, a decision be made on the question of 
whether to register them or not. Measures in accordance with the 
Criminal Code of Ukraine will be applied in respect to persons 
who possess weapons illegally and who continue to store them. 
  I appeal to the law enforcement authorities, primarily 
militia officers, who are at the forward edge of the fight 
against crime. The majority of you are conscientiously 
performing your professional duty to the people, worthily 
mounting guard of the interests of the state, and protecting the 
citizens' rights and liberties. 
  At the same time, the activity of many internal affairs 
authorities does not correspond to the demands made of it. The 
struggle against embezzlement, profiteering, hooliganism, and 
the increased manifestations of organized crime is failing to 
produce the due results. Hundreds of criminals, among whom there 
are many who have committed serious crimes, remain at liberty, 
which is a stern reproach to the professional honor of the 
militia officers. 
  Unfortunately, complacency and an uncritical attitude toward 
the results of their activity are being displayed by some of 
them, and rudeness, indifference, and extortion are being 
tolerated. We need to emphatically rid ourselves of such 
officers and to preserve the purity of the militia ranks. 
  While displaying attention to and concern for law-abiding 
citizens, militia officers must be implacable toward 
transgressors. Their actions in respect to law-breakers must be 
precise, competent, and legitimate. 
  Let the criminals know that their every unlawful action will 
be emphatically cut short and that, should they resist, 
authorized weapons, the right to use which has been broadened 
for militia officers as of late, will be used against them. 
  The president and government of Crimea will, in turn, do 
everything necessary to provide the city and district internal 
affairs authorities as quickly as possible with motor transport 
and other facilities necessary in the work of crime prevention 
and detection. 
  I appeal to the employees of the news media and the corps of 
journalists that they develop the all-around and truthful 
coverage of problems of the fight against crime, actively 
uncover the causes of negative manifestations, and contribute to 
the molding in the public of a respect for the law, the enhanced 
authority of the employees of the militia, the court, the public 
procurator's office, and other law enforcement authorities, and 
propagandize the positive experience of the public formations in 
the prevention of law- breaking. 
  The government and law enforcement authorities of Crimea and 
the population of the republic have sufficient forces for 
cutting short by decisive and firm actions the orgy of crime and 
ensuring legality and firm law and order. 
  Yuriy Meshkov, president of the Republic of Crimea 
  No. 76, 2 March 1994, Simferopol.

<F P=106> [Report by Ulyan Ninel: "Communists Are in the Lead"] </F>
  [Text] Ivan Yemets, head of the Central Electoral 
Commission for the elections of people's deputies of Ukraine, 
has told a news conference that as of 2 March, there were 5,833 
candidates for deputy seats registered; this number, due to 
natural causes, can only decrease. On average, it amounts to 
almost 13 candidates per constituency, but there is also one 
constituency in Kiev with 31 candidates, and 3 constituencies in 
Ukraine with two candidates in each. 
  Among the candidates, 62.3 percent is put forward by the 
electorate; 26.7 percent -- by working collectives; and 11 
percent -- by political parties. As it should be expected, 
those seeking revenge "have got the fidgets": Among the 
political parties, the largest number of candidates was put 
forward by the Communist Party -- 6.7 percent. It is followed 
by the Popular Rukh -- 4.1 percent; the Socialist Party -- 3.11 
percent; the Ukrainian Republican Party -- 2.42 percent; the 
Liberal Party -- 1.43 percent; and the Democratic Party of 
Ukraine -- 1.28 percent. According to Ivan Yemets, there are 
more "disguised" party candidates, but not everyone has decided 
to be put forward by the parties due to their anemia and lack of 
influence. 
  Among the candidates for deputy seats, representatives of 
commercial and entrepreneur structures total 13.2 percent; 
workers of state enterprises -- 10.3 percent; representatives of 
state administration -- 5.4 percent; heads and workers of the 
councils at all levels -- 6.22 percent; managers of state 
enterprises -- 4.6 percent; and workers of law enforcement 
bodies -- 5.7 percent. This undoubtedly means one thing -- 
representatives of all interested circles try to fight for power 
also in a legitimate way. The decrease in the number of 
managers among the candidates was assessed by Ivan Yemets very 
simply: The parliament will work on a professional basis. 
  I. Yemets also mentioned one more consoling fact. The 
current parliament has very few lawyers; the situation in the 
future one may be changed: There are 10.4 percent lawyers and 
8.54 percent economists among the candidates. With regard to 
their professions, the candidates are divided in the following 
way: engineers and technicians -- 24.6 percent; education 
workers -- 15.6 percent; medical workers -- 6.3 percent; 
journalists -- 3.09 percent; and agricultural workers -- over 7 
percent. 
  Among the candidates for deputies, 77 percent are 
Ukrainians; 
18.6 percent are Russians; the rest are of 20 other 
nationalities. Higher education is completed by 89.6 percent of 
the candidates, secondary and secondary vocational education -- 
by 8.8 percent; 43.2 percent (according to questionnaires) of 
the candidates can speak foreign languages. 
  Parliament may be exclusively masculine (there are only 7.4 
percent of females among the candidates) and of urban-site 
residents (there are 14.53 percent of rural-site representatives 
among the candidates). 
  With regard to age, the future parliament may be 
medium-aged: 
90.5 percent of the candidates are between 31 and 60 years old; 
more than 4 percent are over 60 years old; and 5.3 percent are 
between 25 and 30 years old. Thus, dear electors, there are 
candidates for every taste. So, the main issue is to elect them.

<F P=106> [Report by Svitlana Synyakova: "Democrats Will Unite. But </F>
When?"] 
  [Text] Many politicians think that our democrats will 
unite only five minutes before their execution. However, "the 
roundtable" organized at the VECHERNIY KYYIV editorial office 
has given reasons for believing that such a prognosis is not 
quite true. At least, neither Levko Lukyanenko, nor Kostyantyn 
Morozov, nor Vitaliy Karpenko, nor Yuriy Hnatkevich, nor other 
participants in the discussion cast even a doubt regarding the 
possibility for unifying dispersed national democratic forces. 
On the contrary, a number of principal propositions was put 
forward, which can underlie the creation of a political force 
embracing the Ukrainian Republican Party, Rukh, the Democratic 
Party of Ukraine, the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine, the 
national wing of the Party of the Democratic Revival of Ukraine, 
and those remaining for the time being outside political 
parties. These propositions include the independence of 
Ukraine, the safeguarding of personal freedom, as well as 
political and economic reforms, much discussed, but not 
initiated. 
  Such a consolidation is especially necessary in view of the 
presidential elections planned for this year. In order to 
prevent a repetition of the previous elections, national 
democrats have to appoint a single candidate and secure his 
victory. Can this be done? Yes, if party leaders cast off 
their ambitions and give priority to a real candidate. They 
will have to set aside their ambitions. Naturally, if Ukraine 
is really dearer to them than their ego.

without determining the presidential status and authority by the 
[words indistinct] Supreme Council is illogical. This is the 
essence of a statement by the Rukh Small Council, which was

state, or a head of executive authority. The Small Council also 
resolved to immediately begin preparations for local elections 
by all the Rukh structures.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuliya Pshenko: "Social Nationalists Are Not </F>
Eager To Assume Power"] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian Social National Party [SNPU] was 
noticed for the first time in the summer of 1992 when its 
leaflets appeared in Lvov. It was not so much their contents as 
the party's symbol, which looked very much like a swastika, that 
attracted particular attention. At that time, the SNPU backbone 
was comprised of members of "Rukh's Guard" -- youngsters that 
used to be bodyguards of former dissidents some time ago. When 
the "Guard's" militants were all done performing their 
functions, they were "befriended" by a Yaroslav Andrushkiv (he 
used to be responsible for the physical fitness program for 
"Rukh's Guard" members), who realized that he could capitalize 
on those boys. After some time, the new organization began to 
attract the Lvov youth. Its ranks were joined by members of 
other organizations, such as "Spadshchyna," [Heritage] "Plast," 
[Scouts] and "Studentske Bratstvo" [Student Brotherhood]. 
  However, it was last summer when the party became especially 
vocal. Let us just recall the furious reaction of Lvov 
residents to the Black Sea Fleet Treaty signed by L. Kravchuk. 
The entire city was rocked then by a wave of rallies, where 
SNPU members showed themselves in all their glory. At one of 
them, a party's member said out loud: "I dream about staging the 
Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day for Russians, but we don't 
have enough strength, so far." It was, however, just enough for 
them to form the "Committee for Protection of Nation and State" 
that included all far right organizations. The Committee 
actively engaged in forming "people's detachments" ready to 
execute any order of their leaders. At their rallies, the 
nationalists yelled that Ukrainian tanks would shoot at the 
Kremlin. So far, they have managed to get away with it -- maybe 
because no one takes them seriously? But the newly emerged 
Nazis continue to spread their wings, increasing their profile. 
Unidentified thugs shattered windows in all of the Russian high 
schools in Lvov and left as a keepsake slogans that read: 
"Moscow mugs, get out of Ukraine!" It is not difficult to guess 
who were the most immediate suspects. Later last fall, SNPU 
members assaulted the building of the URP [Ukrainian Republican 
Party] oblast department, cracked down on one of the local 
organizations of the "Student Brotherhood" (by that time, the 
Lvov student community had split into those who joined the SNPU 
and those who declined). And very recently, the SNPU boys 
instigated a brawl in the "Postup" cafeteria, where they often 
dropped in. They explained later that it was not them, and that 
the bartender simply managed to identify the cafeteria's 
habitues only. 
  However, all those "little pranks" are nothing compared with 
the Social Nationalists' intention of vigorously participating 
in the upcoming elections. Although the party is not officially 
registered -- and it will hardly be in the nearest future -- its 
21 candidates were proposed for legislature in the Lvov Oblast 
districts. The Social Nationalists are sure that this time, 
people should vote for the true nationalist patriots, and not 
for those who joined only recently. They believe that all 
present legislative deputies must resign, except for S. Khmara 
or I. Kalynets. 
  The Social Nationalists are not eager to seize power today. 
They understand that their time has not yet come. But they do 
not doubt that it eventually will. The SNPU leader Andrushkiv 
said: "We will just wait until people are tired of anarchy, and 
will ask us to grab power. And you bet, we will!"

<F P=106> [Interview with Mariya Oliynyk, chairman of the Donetsk </F>
Oblast branch of the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, by 
Viktor Verbych; place and date not given: "The Time Belongs to 
Moscow, but Ukrainian Spring Is Already on the Doorstep" 
  }[Text] [Verbych] What is the life in this Russified land, 
in which, apparently, pro-imperial and anti-Ukrainian forces are 
currently dominating? 
  [Oliynyk] The life there, of course, is more interesting 
than in Volyn. Perhaps it is much harder, but therefore more 
interesting. The power of action equals the power of 
counteraction. We must stay in good shape all the time, as 
sportsmen say. We have united democratic national forces in the 
Democratic Donetsk [Demokratychna Donechchyna] bloc, which 
includes 15 organizations such as the Congress of Ukrainian 
Nationalists, the Union of Ukrainian Youth, the Plast [scouting 
organization], and the Prosvita [cultural society]. On the 
other hand, procommunist forces are still very active there, as 
they were before. Following the events that took place in 
Moscow last October, however, it became obvious that they were 
defeated. Pro-Yeltsin forces have recently come into prominence. 
  [Verbych] As a matter of fact, these forces are also 
pro-imperial, but perhaps with more a considerable dose of 
demagogy. 
  [Oliynyk] Exactly. They say that they support a market 
economy and privatization, however, only in Russia -- claiming 
that without it, we will not survive. Everything is oriented 
toward Russia, even our time zone is the same as Moscow's, 
according to a resolution of the Oblast Council. 
  [Verbych] Certain steps have been therefore taken toward 
autonomy, and eventually toward seceding from the Ukrainian 
state. 
  [Oliynyk] Do not forget about the so-called experiment: 
Donetsk, Zaporizhzhya, Luhansk, and Dnipropetrovsk Oblasts form 
a special economic zone. Moreover, the authors of the 
experiment will not submit appropriate documents to the Supreme 
Council for adoption, since they have already received support 
from certain presidential circles. Everything will be resolved 
by a presidential decree. Actually, one of the Crimean options 
is being worked out in our oblast. A peculiar supreme council 
of the four oblasts is to be established soon. The only thing 
that distinguishes us from the Crimea is the fact that 51 
percent of our population is Ukrainian (according to the 1989 
census, during which many Ukrainians were registered as 
Russians). Even those Russians who have been living in Donbas 
for a long time, however, are not like those who bask in the 
Crimean sun. The majority of people in Donetsk Oblast 
understand who really wants what, and what have been, and will 
be, the consequences of a pro-Moscow policy. 
  [Verbych] The authors of the experiment, however, hide 
themselves under the slogan "in the name of the people," as the 
Bolsheviks used to do. I would like to hear your opinion about 
the Liberal Party headed by Markulov, who was recently an 
adviser to Kravchuk. To what extent does this party advocate 
the interests of the new pro-Moscow forces? 
  [Oliynyk] The Liberal Party does not register its members. 
There have been statements claiming that the party has 6,000 
members in the Donetsk region alone. However, how could this 
number be substantiated if the party does not register its 
members? This is nonsense. There were 200 people at the 
party's electoral conference held on 6 November. I believe that 
this is all the party's membership. The party is very different 
in various regions. Whereas Kyselyova, vice president of the 
Liberal Party's branch in Lvov, speaks Ukrainian, the party's 
Donetsk branch is no different than communist forces. Our 
liberals openly state: "Only together with Russia." On 3 June, 
they, however, removed from their statute a resolution on 
federalization and bilingualism. They could achieve success 
only due to the fact that they have significant funds. 
  [Verbych] Mrs. Mariya, there are, of course, certain 
achievements that testify to the fact that the Donetsk region is 
an integral part of Ukraine. 
  [Oliynyk] It cannot be said that there are not, but there 
are only a few such achievements. For example, we opened the 
first Ukrainian school in 1990 with the help of the United 
Nations. In 1993, it was much easier to open the 12th high 
school in Donetsk and the first Ukrainian gymnasium in 
Kramatorsk, which 450 children now attend. On 1 December 1993, 
we managed to open the first Ukrainian kindergarten in 
Donetsk.... You should know that the fact that our Ukrainian 
people speak Russian does not mean that they are against 
Ukrainian. The Ukrainian language is taught at the Ukrainian 
high school, there are 11 Ukrainian groups at the university, 
and one group at the medical institute. Whereas we had 23 
Ukrainian classes in Donetsk last year, there are now 60 such 
classes. 
  [Verbych] As the first and last president of the former USSR 
used to say, the process has started. 
  [Oliynyk] Nobody is able to halt this. However, there still 
are scouting camps, at which children wear red bandannas and 
attend solemn meetings on 7 November [anniversary of the October 
revolution]. Nevertheless, the stronghold of the empire is 
receding into the past with every day and every hour. The 
process continues! Without useless pathos, through our everyday 
hard work, we endeavor to prevent a wedge from being driven 
between Ukrainian territories, dividing them between East and 
West.

  [Text] Kiev, 8 Mar -- A sitting of the Lesser Council of 
the People's Movement of Ukraine took place on 7 March. Its 
participants adopted a statement, which notes in particular: 
"The People's Movement of Ukraine appealed to all of Ukraine's 
political forces back in the autumn with a request to avoid 
discussing the issue of electing a president of Ukraine and 
possible candidates for this post during the Supreme Council 
election campaign. 
  "With his latest statements about the untimeliness of 
presidential elections and his possible non-participation in 
them, President Kravchuk has caused political tension in 
society, which could be negatively reflected in the Supreme 
Council elections. 
  "Under such conditions the Lesser Council of the People's 
Movement of Ukraine considers holding presidential elections 
before either the existing or the newly-elected Supreme Council 
decides on the status and powers of Ukraine's president to be 
illogical (?and) differing from the practice of civilized 
countries. The people of Ukraine should know whom they will be 
electing: Only the head of state or the head of executive power. 
  "We are calling on all political parties, public 
organizations and groupings to refrain from discussing 
candidacies for the post of president of Ukraine in the mass 
media. All forces should be concentrated on the Supreme Council 
elections not being disrupted, because this would lead Ukraine 
to anarchy or dictatorship by the nomenklatura elite. 
  "We believe that following Ukraine's Supreme Council 
elections, parties and public organizations of a 
national-democratic tendency should hold consultations with the 
aim of agreeing on a single candidacy for the post of president 
from all of the national-democratic forces."

<F P=106> [Report by Oleh Olenyuk: "Candidates Are Assuming Their </F>
Natural Role: Everybody Fights Everybody"] 
  [Text] The current electoral battles for the 23 seats 
assigned for Lvov Oblast have revealed a rather sad trend -- 
parochial interests prevail over national ones. Attempts by 
national democrats, whose standing in the region is higher than 
that of other parties to form electoral blocs with their 
opponents, have remained an unattainable dream in the oblast. 
As a result of this, about 10 different parties have registered 
for the elections, including communists and national socialists. 
The motley candidate lists and democrats' tactics of creating 
artificial competition within their own ranks, may produce 
unexpected results and grant unwanted people participation in 
the second round of elections. Although the probability of such 
an outcome is quite problematic given the majority electoral 
system, it cannot be disregarded. 
  Speaking of different political blocs' chances in the 
current 
electoral marathon, those of the Rukh and the New Wave 
association seem more preferable. These two affiliated 
organizations (most New Wave nominees enjoy Rukh's support) can 
count on 60-70 percent of the seats granted for Lvov Oblast. 
The only people capable of changing this proportion are the new 
nomenklatura from the presidential administration and local 
councils. Some of these people have nothing against acting 
under the Rukh's umbrella. The unquestionable leaders of this 
bilateral (or tripartite) union are Yukhnovskyy, Pynzenyk, 
Kosiv, Lavrynovych, Kendzior, Boychyshyn, and Oblast Council 
Chairman Mykola Horyn. 
  Only one member of the Congress of National Democratic 
Forces 
has a chance of winning a legislative seat, namely Mykhaylo 
Horyn's former deputy Oleh Pavlyshyn. Mykhaylo Horyn himself is 
going to face a fierce political showdown with his one-time 
partner Stepan Khmara. However, if the congress formed a bloc 
with Larysa Skoryk's Nationwide Movement and the anti-Chornovil 
democratic nomenklatura, such a right-center coalition could win 
as many as 30 percent of the seats. Democratic nationalists 
from the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists can count on two or 
three seats in rural districts. The situation of the 
Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists is similar. The 
followers of Melnyk [nationalist leader of 1940's] can win one 
or two seats. 
  The dramatic increase in the popularity of the ultraright 
National Independence of Ukraine [DSU], the Ukrainian National 
Assembly [UNA], and the national socialists is one of the 
unexpected phenomena of recent weeks. Promises to restore order 
and make Ukraine rich could grant them and the Conservative 
Republican Party victories in 30 percent of the districts. 
However under the current circumstances, this group can only 
expect two to four seats. If the rightist parties manage to 
discredit the democrats by accusing them of accepting bribes and 
noting the semitic origin of their capital and their readiness 
to betray Ukraine's national interests, their claims on 
legislative seats might become much more substantiated. However 
this camp too, has not rid itself of the democrats' disease of 
infighting. National Self-Defense candidate Vitovych has been 
nominated candidate in one district with DSU member 
Shcherbatyuk; national socialists Hodysh and Tyahnybok are going 
to fight against UNA's Shkil and Ostap Kozak respectively. 
  Only the extreme left parties -- communists and socialists 
led by Ukrainian Communist Party Central Committee member Adam 
Martynyuk, are not experiencing any of these problems. Their 
chances to win the elections in at least one urban district are 
miserable. Yet, these people could receive some votes from 
naturalized immigrants in urban districts with a high percentage 
of Russian-speaking voters, and thus make it to the second round 
of elections. However this is everything they can dream of. 
The so-called independent candidates are in a similar situation 
and can count either on votes from their relatives and friends, 
or on their own capital.

<F P=106> [Interview with Boris Sergeevich Balayan, chairman of the </F>
Crimean Party of Interethnic Trust, by O. Volodin; place and 
date not given: "The Crimean Party of Interethnic Trust Finds 
Supporters Not Only in the Crimea" -- first two paragraphs are 
O. Volodin commentary] 
  [Text] Recently, the Political Council of the Crimean Party 
of Interethnic Trust [KPMD] came forward with an initiative that 
deserves our attention and support. The essence of this 
initiative is that the activities of the political parties and 
movements in the Crimea and outside of it should be coordinated 
on the principles of interethnic and civil accord. Permanent 
meetings of these parties and movements in their joint 
headquarters in the Crimea could become one of the mechanisms 
for the implementation of this idea. We queried KPMD Chairman 
Boris Sergeevich Balayan on their initiative. 
  [Volodin] Boris Sergeevich, what specific parties and public 
movements would you like to invite to participate in the Crimean 
"roundtable"? 
  [Balayan] Like-minded people, those political parties that 
do 
not simply speak about the principles of interethnic and civil 
accord and about peace but consequently look for opportunities 
to implement such noble principles. We negotiate, for example, 
with the party of "Russian Unity and Accord," headed by Sergey 
Shakhray, and with the popular political association in Ukraine 
headed by Vladimir Grinev and Leonid Kuchma. Besides, there are 
parties that advocate our principles in other parts of the Black 
Sea region, and in the states which are motherlands for many of 
Crimeans of various nationalities. These are Armenia, Greece, 
Bulgaria, Germany, and many other countries. 
  [Volodin] The CSCE deals with the issues of keeping peace in 
the European home, there are many organizations which deal with 
the economy, science, and culture of many countries. How can 
you justify the creation of one more center in the Crimea? 
  [Balayan] Our idea was not born in an empty place. The 
Crimea can claim the establishment of such a center on its 
geographical location, and historical traditions; we proceed 
from the task of turning our peninsula into a connecting link 
between the neighboring states, the region of peace and accord. 
  Independent experts and scientists -- who are not usually 
engaged in political competition -- could draft scientific 
recommendations, a sort of code of rules on how to pursue a 
civilized policy for statesmen and political leaders at the 
meetings of parties of various ethnic membership. Of course, 
joint consultations of political scientists from Russia, 
Ukraine, Transcaucasia, and other states of the Black Sea region 
could help analyze the developments and foresee the future. In 
other words, we could prevent many negative conflicts so that we 
do not act "in a hurry," as it has been common for us until now. 
  Finally, the setting up of such a permanent international 
body in the Crimea would objectively widen our economic, 
cultural, and social relations with a wide range of states as an 
answer to common interests. 
  [Volodin] Do you believe in the success of your idea? 
  [Balayan] Not only because we should believe in the eternal 
good. Our proposals have already met with the understanding of 
like-minded people from the interethnic parties outside the 
Crimea. I hope that the new Crimean president will pay attention 
to our proposal.

  [Text] The Chernobyl nuclear power station remains a source 
of nuclear-explosion and radiation danger. Mikhail Umanets, 
chairman of the Ukrainian State Nuclear Power Committee, told an 
International Conference of Soviet-Made Nuclear Reactor Users, 
which opened in Moscow Wednesday, that experts were especially 
worried over the condition of the fourth Chernobyl power unit 
that had been destroyed by the 1986 explosion. Umanets said 
that the unit could be made safe within three to five years if 
developed countries helped. 
  Umanets said that "as long as it is short of energy and cash 
Ukraine cannot afford closing the Chernobyl station." He 
thought that the station could be transformed into a store for 
radioactive waste. 
  He emphasized that all the processing and storing units were 
situated in Russia and that Russia had been refusing to accept 
Ukraine's radioactive waste which therefore had to be kept at 
Ukrainian nuclear power stations. 
  Umanets complained of skilled personnel leaving Ukrainian 
nuclear power stations where they are paid less than in Russia. 
Over 2000 people, about 1000 of whom were highly-skilled 
personnel, had quit jobs in Ukrainian nuclear power stations in 
1993.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Hryhoriy Omelchenko, chief of the </F>
Security Service Military Counterintelligence Department for 
Fighting Organized Crime and Corruption, by unidentified 
UKRAYINA MOLODA correspondent in Poltava; date not given: 
"Democracy Is a Mother of Order, But Mafia Is Immortal"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Correspondent] I cannot 
ignore your recent statement about $18 billion allegedly 
deposited in Western, mostly Swiss, banks by 500 "select" 
Ukrainian citizens and your readiness to make public the entire 
list of the owners of this fabulous wealth. This statement will 
undoubtedly win you more votes in the elections. However, 
people that have even a slight idea about professionalism would 
laugh at this, saying that having looked for Polubotok's gold in 
England [reference to claims that Ukraine should try to recover 
the money once deposited by a Ukrainian nobleman in a British 
bank]; now we will wait to receive $18 billion from Switzerland. 
Where is your list? Where are the facts and documents 
acknowledged by foreign financial bodies and governments that 
can help recover at least one "dirty" dollar? 
  [Omelchenko] Let me explain something. The mass media 
carried not very precise reports about the news conferences on 
the results of the international seminar on fighting the spread 
of money laundering, held in Kiev on 15-17 December 1993. 
Speaking at that news conference, I pointed out that foreign 
media had cited experts and written about $15 or even $18 
billion belonging to Ukrainian citizens, commercial, and state 
structures and deposited in Western banks. According to our 
experts, that figure is exaggerated and the actual sum is $7 to 
$8 billion. 
  What makes us think so? Let me cite some figures. In 1992, 
some 1,500 licenses were issued in Ukraine for exporting various 
products and raw materials. Not taking into account barter 
operations, those products were worth more than $5 billion. 
However, the hard currency fund of Ukraine received only $97.7 
million. In the first half of 1993, more than $4 billion worth 
of products and raw materials were shipped out of Ukraine, while 
the budget received only a little more than $100 million. By 
summing up these figures we can deduce the volume of foreign 
deposits. I spoke about this at the news conference. 
  Given that almost two-thirds of Ukraine's hard currency is 
being kept in Swiss banks, I have asked the chief of the Swiss 
Federal Ministry of Justice Criminal Department a couple of 
questions. The questions concerned the possible ways to carry 
out an investigation of the legality of Ukrainian citizens' 
currency operations. In particular, I wanted to know whether 
Switzerland would answer our official legal motion to provide 
information about concrete Ukrainian deposit-holders suspected 
of violations of the law. 
  With regard to recovering the "dirty dollars," our 
"Godfathers" have nothing to worry about. The laws of the Swiss 
"bank empire" are very liberal for people like them. Remember 
that even after the International Court in the Hague confirmed 
the validity of Philippine claims on the $20 billion embezzled 
by former dictator Marcos, the money remained in Switzerland. 
  However this does not mean that Ukraine should hold off on 
ratifying the Council of Europe convention on the laundering of 
money, and the search, arrest, and confiscation of illegally 
acquired profits. Since 1992, the Ukrainian Secret Service 
leadership has repeatedly requested that the Supreme Council 
discuss this issue. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "What Provokes Destabilization?"] </F>
  [Text] "The new Defense Ministry leadership is hampering 
the establishment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces." These words 
begin a statement sent to our paper by the Union of Officers of 
Ukraine [SOU], which has been signed by SOU Chairman Major 
General Oleksandr Rol. The statement points out that although 
concerns over strengthening the defense system of our country 
are voiced in the media, they are not followed up with practical 
activities. Offshoots of democratic and national traditions are 
being squandered; the Ukrainian language is being introduced in 
the Army very slowly. Again, as it was in the former Soviet 
Army, "officers' meetings" are being reintroduced, which have 
always served for the reactionary army leadership as an element 
of pressuring its subordinates. 
  Responsible military leaders want to drag the Ukrainian 
Armed 
Forces into the CIS Joint Forces. Dismissals of servicemen who 
refuse to serve Ukraine and want to go abroad are being stalled. 
The implementation of a program for national, military-patriotic 
education of servicemen and youth is being delayed. The SOU, 
reads the statement, is against the unilateral nuclear 
disarmament of Ukraine, the transfer of Black Sea Fleet vessels 
to Russia, the lease of the city of Sevastopol and its onshore 
infrastructure, and deployment of foreign troops on our 
country's territory. The SOU considers prolonged delays in 
payments to contract servicemen and the failure to provide 
housing for them, which deteriorates their living conditions, as 
a dangerous action which provokes destabilization in certain 
military units and generates an unwillingness to serve in the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces. 
  The statement concludes with an appeal to the Ukrainian 
president to immediately resolve the social and legal problems 
of servicemen, which are destabilizing the situation in the 
Armed forces, and which are a consequence of pressure on our 
state and its internal affairs.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "On Sea or Land -- Let Us Be </F>
Ourselves"] 
  [Text] Activists of the Kiev branch of the Officers' 
Union of Ukraine [SOU] at their meeting have proposed submitting 
questions on our state security and integrity to a nationwide 
referendum. 
  As is known, the protocol "On regulation of problems of the 
Black Sea Fleet," signed by the Ukrainian and Russian presidents 
in Masandra in September 1993, entrusted "the governmental 
delegations of Ukraine and the Russian Federation with the task 
of studying, within one month, all questions relevant to the 
drafting of an agreement, in accordance with which the entire 
Black Sea Fleet along with its infrastructure in the Crimea can 
be used by Russia and bear Russian symbols, providing the 
Russian side will make appropriate settlements for half of the 
Black Sea Fleet, including its infrastructure, which by virtue 
of previous agreements was assigned to Ukraine" (taken from the 
original). Ukraine's leadership, emphasizes the recent 
statement of SOU Kiev branch, has declined to inform the people 
of the truth about the Masandra agreement in every possible way. 
Ukraine's Defense Minister K. Morozov, who resisted the selling 
of Ukrainian territory and property, was dismissed from his post. 
  Having postponed the above-mentioned agreement (but not 
given 
up its intents), the state leadership adopted a course for 
transferring nuclear weapons to Russia. Through pro-Moscow 
specialists in nuclear weapons, a preconceived and purposeful 
campaign has been launched to threaten the Ukrainian people with 
the possible consequences of keeping warheads on the Ukrainian 
territory. In addition, the state leadership hides Ukraine's 
rejection of the proposal from U.S. firms to built a joint 
enterprise for reprocessing uranium from warheads into nuclear 
fuel for nuclear power plants, from which Ukraine could derive 
great profits. Moreover, public opinion is not informed of the 
fact that Ukraine primarily transfers to Russia those nuclear 
weapons whose shelf life expires in 2005, while those already 
unfit for use are remaining. 
  Having acquired the Supreme Council support for the 
trilateral agreement on transferring Ukrainian nuclear weapons 
to Russia, our state leadership returned to the Masandra 
agreement on transferring Ukraine's part of the Black Sea Fleet 
to Russia "to pay off debts," as well as on leasing the Black 
Sea shoreland in the Crimea and Sevastopol together with its 
infrastructure. In addition to that, our leaders do not even 
raise the question of Russian troops' withdrawal from Ukraine's 
territory. 
  Feeling itself responsible for the destiny of Ukraine, for 
the destiny of the servicemen of Ukraine's Armed Forces, reads 
the statement, the Kiev branch of the SOU thinks that the 
questions of Ukraine's security and integrity (nuclear status, 
lease of the territory, state and administration system, 
deployment of foreign troops, selling of the Black Sea Fleet) 
should be submitted to a nationwide referendum on 27 March 1994.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Guard Lieutenant Colonel Volodymyr </F>
Korkodym, editor of VIYSKO UKRAYINY, by Serhiy Kulida in New 
York; date not given: "Ukraine's Likely Enemy -- Russia"] 
  [Text] [Kulida] Lieutenant Colonel, Sir, Ukraine's 
military doctrine was the main topic of the speech you delivered 
in New York. I would like you to at least outline the essence of 
your speech. 
  [Korkodym] Ukraine's military doctrine anticipates that a 
state, which includes claims against Ukraine as part of its 
official policy, will be considered by Ukraine as an enemy, and 
Ukraine will be forced to defend itself. We have openly stated 
in our magazine that Russia is Ukraine's likely enemy. Our 
scientists who work on strategic research have confirmed this 
statement. According to their studies, Poland, Romania, and 
Hungary can also become our possible enemies. I do not believe, 
however, that a conflict with any of these countries is possible 
in the near future. Nevertheless, if we do not take care of our 
security, problems may appear. 
  Russia's military doctrine, no matter with what words it is 
camouflaged, remains imperial in nature, and we understand this 
very well. Ukraine's military doctrine, on the contrary, is 
peaceful. It is a policy of a neutral country which wants to 
live peacefully with its neighbors, even those who are currently 
making territorial claims against it. 
  [Kulida] I believe that you have in mind our "elder 
brother," or more precisely "elder sister," Russia.... Your 
statement is not groundless, since Russia is very cleverly using 
national conflicts which have recently erupted in the former 
USSR. 
  [Korkodym] Exactly. For example, Moldova... or 
Transcaucasus, where two Russian battalions were deployed and, 
clad in Abkhazian fatigues, fought on the Georgian front. It 
can be said that this is one of the reasons that forced the 
Georgian Government to sit at the negotiating table and 
eventually return to the CIS. With Ukraine, the same thing will 
be harder to achieve. 
  There is another example: While withdrawing its regiments 
and divisions from East Europe, Russia is deploying them on the 
borders with Ukraine and Belarus. The 46th division was 
withdrawn from Czechoslovakia in this manner. Two motorized 
regiments were deployed in Kharkiv Oblast -- which were later 
subordinated to the Ukrainian National Guard -- and two heavy 
artillery regiments and a tank regiment were deployed on Russian 
territory near the Ukrainian border. Although Russia's military 
power is significant, the Russian Army is demoralized. Russia 
is not ready for a military action against Ukraine. 
  [Kulida] This, however, should not tranquilize us. There is 
still the problem of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  [Korkodym] This problem is extremely complex.... This is a 
question of the far-sighted imperial policy of Russia. The 
Black Sea Fleet is the main threat to a free Ukraine. We 
committed a very serious error by not removing Admiral Kasatonov 
from command, giving him instead the opportunity to freely 
command the fleet that is deployed on Ukrainian territory. This 
issue was forced into a corner, and it was not resolved in time. 
The situation is not improving currently, and a conflict can 
erupt just in the Crimea, in Sevastopol. For example, when we 
sent our draftees, the Ukrainian boys were not admitted on Navy 
vessels, and they [Russians] secretly brought in Russian seamen 
from Novorosiysk. 
  Although we have only a few naval ships today, new ones are 
being built in Mykolayiv, Kherson, and Kiev. Every year, 10 
completed vessels will be launched. The morale of our sailors 
who serve in the Navy is very high, and this is very important, 
because, I am not afraid to say this, they are surrounded by our 
potential enemies, and in case of emergency, they will have to 
resist the first blow of the enemy. 
  [Kulida] By the way, have not they lost their heart in 
connection with the transfer of nuclear weapons, which is very 
strange, taking into account postulates of Ukraine's military 
doctrine toward Russia. 
  [Korkodym] I believe that we are not giving up our nuclear 
weapons today. We gave them up before, when we allowed 
medium-range missiles be transferred to Russia. These were the 
most modern and mobile missiles, and in case of emergency, they 
were able to defend Ukraine. We retained strategic missiles 
targeted at the United States, whose levers of command remain in 
Moscow anyway. Ukraine, of course, will never wage a war 
against the United States. Russia acted more decisively, and 
the medium-range missiles were simply stolen. I blame this on 
the inexperience of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and their 
leadership. 
  [Kulida] Since we have already touched upon nuclear weapons, 
how do you assess the signing of the tripartite agreement among 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, and Russian President Boris Yeltsin? 
  [Korkodym] The Ukrainian president let the world know that 
the Ukrainian state is peaceful, and it acts according to the 
norms of international relations. It is very hard to withstand 
someone's position among such giants as the United States and 
Russia, even because of the current economic situation in 
Ukraine. Therefore, this was another forced, and probably 
necessary, step made by the Ukrainian president. We, 
servicemen, should not despair however. 
  [Kulida] Let us return to military and state issues. To 
what extent, in your opinion, is Ukraine protected against 
interference in its internal affairs? 
  [Korkodym] We have almost 600,000 servicemen in the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces, 20,000 troops in the National Guard, and 
a slight lower number of soldiers serve in the Border Troops. 
As of today, the National Guard and the Border Troops protect 
the borders with Russia and Belarus. Previously, they assumed 
protection over our Western borders. There are already 
checkpoints and customs houses. These units were also deployed 
on the Moldovan border when a conflict erupted in that country, 
and they prevented the conflict from spreading to Ukraine. This 
was an initial form of combat training, or sorts. 
  Of course, the Army and the state are tightly connected. We 
also have economic problems. 
  It must be said that there was a problem with transforming 
the Soviet Army, or more precisely a part of it, into the 
Ukrainian one until quite recently. This attitude was, however, 
wrong. This was also admitted by Defense Minister General 
Radetskyy, and even the Supreme Council session addressed this 
issue. Now, this question is formulated differently, as not 
transforming but establishing the Ukrainian Armed Forces on a 
new ideological basis and new values. There is another question 
that bothers me a lot. A precise program for establishing a 
modern and professional army has not yet been worked out. 
  [Kulida] In young countries, and Ukraine as a state is just 
being formed, success in establishing a military system as well 
as a state one depends on the military. What is the mood among 
Ukrainian officers? 
  [Korkodym] I will frankly say that not all the officers who 
have taken the oath of allegiance to Ukraine, and who are 
predominantly Russians who came to serve here in the times of 
the USSR, are convinced that they will protect the interests of 
Ukraine. They have taken the oath only because they have 
obtained housing here, since it is in short supply in Russia. 
We have conducted research and found out that there are many 
such officers. These people are currently returning to Russia, 
they are being relieved from their oath, and nobody is 
disturbing them. Only officers who are dedicated patriots 
remain with us. This is the main precondition for the reliable 
protection of Ukraine. 
  [Kulida] Let us address another extremely important issue -- 
youth and the Army. 
  [Korkodym] This issue is both important and painful. We 
have inherited all the troubles that existed in the Soviet Army. 
First of all, this is the bullying of conscripts. The Defense 
Ministry has work our a program for combating this phenomenon. 
However, it will be impossible to overcome it without 
ideological education of youth according to traditions of 
Ukrainian history and literature, and on examples of famous sons 
and daughters of Ukraine. This task relates not only to the 
Army. This is, first of all, a task for the family, school, and 
state.

president, took place from 3-7 March. Our special correspondent 
Anatoliy Tabachenko reports. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] After the documents were signed a joint news 
conference began, at which both presidents made statements. 
Leonid Kravchuk said in particular: 
  [Begin Kravchuk recording] Ladies and gentlemen. We have 
just put our signatures to a number of extremely important 
bilateral documents, which create a legal basis for our 
cooperation in the sphere of the economy, trade, and other 
spheres. What one may without exaggeration call a historic 
moment in relations between our states took place before your 
own eyes a few minutes ago. Today we have in fact turned the 
page in the still short history of our bilateral relations, 
which seemed to connect us forever with the complex problem, 
colossal in scale, of the nuclear weapons inherited by Ukraine 
from the former [Soviet] Union. Although this problem remains 
complex now, we have managed to bring it essentially and 
substantially nearer to a (?successful resolution) by joint 
efforts. 
  The new dislocation of forces on the political map of the 
world has particularly demonstrated the necessity of creating a 
global system of security, which would work in accordance with 
new principles. We are aware that the complex processes of 
international security and peace are interconnected and failures 
or a vacuum in some or other part of the world cannot be 
permitted, especially on the European continent. 
  For this very reason, I and President Bill Clinton agreed 
that the political and economic security of Ukraine, which plays 
an important and stabilizing role in its region, and this is not 
just our opinion, is of equally exceptional significance both 
for the people of Ukraine and for all of humanity, and (?for 
Americans) too. Proceeding from this key idea, we understand 
that relations between Ukraine and the United States of America 
should be constructed as relations between friendly states, 
which should have many more joint interests than differences. 
  During the talks with President Clinton, we were convinced 
that the American side understands our problems and expresses 
concern at the serious economic condition of Ukraine. We saw 
that the U.S. Administration does not only hail the Ukrainian 
Government's measures to overcome the economic crisis, but also 
expresses readiness to render Ukraine the necessary assistance 
in many directions of an economic orientation, as the President 
has just said. 
  Today we signed a package of economic agreements and 
accords, 
which I hope will help Ukraine to considerably ease and 
accelerate the movement to a market, remove the tension in the 
economy, and (?also) in the daily life of our people. We have 
been convinced that in America we have a friend, whom we need 
and at the right time too. Today Ukraine is a friend, as they 
say, in need, but a friend indeed, as your well-known American 
saying goes. But I believe that the day will come when we will 
truly recall these times as the era of the birth and 
establishment of true friendship between the two peoples and 
states of Ukraine and the United States of America. I thank you 
for your attention. [applause]. [passage omitted] 
  [Kravchuk] We used to smelt half of the former Soviet 
Union's 
cast iron and steel. [We have] great chemistry, Donbass, and 
nuclear power engineering. All this creates preconditions which 
require large resources, primarily energy resources, while these 
energy resources are concentrated outside Ukraine, mainly in 
Russia. In the last year and a half the prices for these 
resources has risen a thousand-fold and more. [Words indistinct] 
it is surprising how our economy could withstand it when energy 
carrier prices have gone up by a thousand to fifteen hundred 
times within such a short period. This is an important 
objective cause of (?our difficulties). 
  We also have Chernobyl, with over 12 percent of the budget 
spent on (?eliminating) the Chernobyl aftermath. 
(?Historically), we (?inherited from) the Soviet Union immense 
armed forces with over a million people. They have to be 
reformed and reduced so that these people are provided [word 
indistinct] socially and supplied with houses and so on and so 
forth. 
  We now have another problem relating to the elimination of 
nuclear weapons. There also is a problem of providing social 
security for a great many people, to speak nothing of other 
problems of our economy -- the links that were formed with the 
former Soviet Union. Ukraine's economy was only a segment of 
that great economy and this segment served as an assembly plant 
in the Soviet Union or as a provider of part of the collective 
deliveries that were mainly consummated in (?production) in 
Russia. 
  All this now needs to be redone and reformed. The structure 
of industry needs to be changed. This requires much expenditure 
and will take some time. Our human, natural, technological and 
scientific resources, however, are extraordinarily great. 
  We have not yet done everything as far as our legislation is 
concerned, no. We have not managed to put everything into 
practice to create preconditions for, shall we say, the economy 
and the free movement of the workforce, capital and money to 
develop jointly. The banking, financial and credit system has 
not yet been worked out entirely. All this is now being 
elaborated, detailed and reformed. 
  Clearly, this will be done quicker with the aid of 
experienced people who are in this hall today and in the United 
States of America in general, who will come to Ukraine and help 
implement it and assist us by sharing their experience. We are 
totally aware that nobody will pull Ukraine out of the economic 
crisis except for its own self and its people. We, however, 
also know that how quickly this can be done depends on whether 
Ukraine has real financial, economic and investment aid or is 
left face to face with its problems and grave consequences of 
the past. 
  Politically, I am convinced Ukraine can and will play a 
stabilizing part in Europe. It can become a state where 
democracy, liberty, reforms, markets and transformations will 
lead the way. All this is a must in our future. I am also 
convinced Ukraine's future lies in its ties with European and 
world financial and economic structures. 
  We also realize that the proportion of these ties today is 
not determined in the Ukrainian economy. It is there, however, 
where the future lies, because the development of society, 
technological changes, scientific and technological 
transformations are only possible on the basis of close ties 
with advanced technologies, market and financial structures of 
Europe, the world, the United States of America and other 
countries that have much experience and great possibilities in 
this respect. 
  Today, however, we also orient our economy toward the CIS 
market because we know this market is a real one for the 
economies of Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and others. In other 
words, all this has to happen gradually, by way of gathering 
experience, accumulating capital and restructuring, shall we 
say, industrial enterprises on a large scale through the 
conversion of our military industrial complex. So I appeal to 
you to understand the situation in Ukraine and realize its role, 
its possibilities, and its potential. Politically, our visit to 
the United States of America is exactly about expressly and 
clearly determining the political attitude, including by the 
United States of America, to Ukraine as a European state with a 
great future. This great future much depends on how and what 
emphasis is placed politically and economically by the great 
world state of the United States of America. 
  I thank the people present here for their attention and can 
answer your questions. [passage omitted] 
  [Kravchuk] I (?want) to say that when meeting at the 
Pentagon 
in particular, and other places too, we did not just discuss the 
volume of assistance, but the mechanisms for making use of it 
too. For example, we agreed with the U.S. minister of defense 
[as heard] that a considerable part of the assistance will go 
toward housing for and the social protection of officers who 
will be made redundant. Specific figures and time periods have 
even been determined -- that is, the talk is now about the value 
of the assistance and ways of making use of it, and so it was 
with every route for this assistance. [end recording] [passage 
omitted]

president's visit to Washington, Foreign Minister Anatoliy 
Zlenko stated that the U.S. Administration has reinterpreted its

  [Text] Proposals from a Ukrainian delegation make the idea 
of forming financial-industrial groups and joint-stock 
enterprises within the CIS quite achievable -- This is how 
Volodymyr Melnyk, senior official at the Ukrainian Cabinet of 
Ministers, assessed the preliminary agreements reached among the 
Commonwealth states at their talks in Moscow. He also pointed 
out that Kiev's official support of the idea does not contradict 
Ukraine's admission as merely an associate member of the CIS 
economic union. This standpoint has been officially proclaimed 
earlier by the Government of Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Konstantin Marchenko report under "From Our Correspondents </F>
and News Agencies" rubric: "Did Kiev Sell Arms to Tehran?"] 
  [Text] Kiev -- At a news conference in Kiev organized by 
the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine to mark the 15th anniversary of 
the Islamic Revolution, Iran's first deputy ambassador to 
Ukraine, Agadzhani [name as transliterated], drew the press's 
attention to an item in THE WASHINGTON POST. It reported that 
an exchange of Iranian oil for Ukrainian artillery mounts took 
place in 1992. According to the Iranian diplomat, his state 
exchanged oil neither for artillery mounts nor even for tank 
spares. Earlier, Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy 
had stated that, while he is an advocate of the arms trade, 
nevertheless Ukraine should not for the moment sell off its 
arsenals; it is necessary first to create a closed production 
cycle.

  [Text] The Defense Ministry Press Service has reported that 
the Armenian Armed Forces subjected our Army's positions in 
Fizulinskiy Rayon to intense artillery shelling as of 0830 
yesterday morning. Following the artillery barrage, the enemy 
launched an attack supported by four tanks and over 100 men and 
reoccupied the rayon town of Ashagy-Seidakhmedli. After 
suffering many losses in the fighting, the enemy is bringing in 
reinforcements to this sector in an effort to press ahead with 
the offensive. Fierce fighting is continuing in Fizulinskiy 
Rayon. 
  At the same time, the Armenians opened artillery fire on our 
positions in Agdamskiy Rayon. 
  The Armenian Armed Forces units continued unsuccessful 
attempts yesterday to capture the Omar Pass in the Murov 
mountain range. Over 70 enemy troops were killed in this sector 
in the past two days.

  [Excerpt] Baku -- While various organizations are 
continuing their efforts to find a solution to the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, there is absolute uncertainty 
regarding the cease-fire. 
  While the [Azerbaijani] Defense Ministry announced that 
Armenians have been using various weapons to shell Azerbaijani 
positions for the past three days, high-ranking officials at the 
Presidential Office are indicating that there is only a verbal 
agreement on a cease-fire. 
  It is being suggested that the protocol signed by the 
Azerbaijani and Armenian defense ministers in Moscow with the 
mediation of Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is not being 
implemented, because it was not approved by President Geydar 
Aliyev. 
  An official at the Presidential Office who did not want to 
be 
named noted that there is no formal cease-fire agreement with 
Armenia and that the existing agreement is only a verbal one. 
The same official added that there can be no cease-fire unless 
the Armenians withdraw from part of the occupied land. [passage

  [Text] While the cease-fire, which went into effect in 
Azerbaijan yesterday, is mostly being observed, the Azerbaijani 
Presidential Office has denied reports that Russian troops will 
supervise the withdrawal of the Armenian troops from the 
occupied lands. 
  The presidential press official [state adviser] Gabil 
Guseyinly denied reports to the effect that the Russians will 
set up 35 control points as Armenians withdraw from lands they 
occupied in Azerbaijan "outside Karabakh." 
  Guseyinly said: "No agreement to this effect has been 
signed. Besides, President Aliyev is completely opposed to it. 
Aliyev insists that if the presence of military observers in 
the conflict zone is needed, then international observers, 
including Turkish troops, should be dispatched under CSCE 
direction." 
  Recalling that the Armenians should have started withdrawing 
from the occupied lands in keeping with the cease-fire that went 
into effect on 1 March, Guseyinly indicated that so far no 
withdrawal has taken place in the region. 
  In the meantime Jan Eliasson, chairman of CSCE Minsk Group, 
who is now in Azerbaijan, left for Nagorno-Karabakh's capital 
Khankendi [Stepanakert] for talks with Armenian officials. He 
will go later to Yerevan for talks with Armenian government 
officials.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Grigoriy Arslanov and </F>
Vyacheslav Tomilin] 
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Mar -- The Chinese leadership has 
reiterated its firm stance that violent alterations of borders 
and attacks against the territorial integrity of states are 
inadmissable. This approach is exceptionally important for 
Baku, Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev said in Beijing today. 
  The visit, which has made it possible to establish good 
relations at the level of the two countries' top leadership, has 
opened up new prospects for the further development of ties 
between China and Azerbaijan, which is going through a difficult 
period in its history, he stressed at a news conference. "We 
attach great significance to this, bearing in mind the important 
place China occupies in the international economic system and in 
world politics," the president of Azerbaijan said. 
  Geydar Aliyev said that the talks with PRC President Jiang 
Zemin and today's conversation with State Council Premier Li 
Peng enabled him to talk in detail about the situation in the 
republic and the region as a whole and, primarily, about the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani armed conflict. 
  "Azerbaijan," the president stressed, "does not want a war, 
is striving for a cessation of hostilities, and wants a 
settlement of the conflict by peaceful means. However, the 
unconditional withdrawal of Armenian armed formations from the 
occupied territories of Azerbaijan and the guarantee of 
Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and the inviolability of its 
borders are absolute conditions." He linked the possibility of 
reviewing the status of Nagorno-Karabakh with fulfillment of 
these conditions. 
  Replying to a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent, 
Geydar Aliyev said: "Azerbaijani-Russian relations are normal, 
good, and friendly. Until recently, there were difficulties 
between the two countries, mainly because of the stance of the 
former leadership of Azerbaijan. Since the second half of last 
year relations have been improving. During my recent meeting in 
Moscow with President Boris Yeltsin, we agreed on measures to 
remove obstacles to the development of ties." Touching on the 
role of the Russian Federation in halting the Karabakh conflict, 
he noted that Russia has been constantly participating in the 
settlement process but so far there have been no results. 
During the recent meeting between the defense ministers of 
Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia in Moscow, an accord was reached 
on a cease-fire from 1 March and the withdrawal of Armenian 
armed formations from the territory of Azerbaijan. However, 
because of the actions of the Armenian side, this has been 
breached, Geydar Aliyev said. 
  Tomorrow the president of Azerbaijan flies to Shanghai.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk from the "World Last Week" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Zionists committed a crime in Hebron in the 
occupied territories early last Friday. The criminal action 
recalled the Dayr Yasin and Kafr Qasim incidents. They 
massacred dozens of Palestinians who prayed in a mosque. The 
incident caused clashes between the Palestinians and the 
Zionists throughout the occupied territories. The massacre of 
Palestinians praying in a mosque in Hebron last week caused a 
wave of mourning in the Islamic world and infuriated the 
international community. Some 70 Palestinians were killed and 
dozens of others were wounded. In an effort to prove that 
Israel's military forces were not linked with the incident, the 
Zionist regime described the assailant as mad. But the 
indications are that the Israeli military forces had a part in 
realizing the tragic incident. The Hebron incident has exposed 
the true nature of the Zionist regime and the international 
community has witnessed that the innocent Palestinian people 
have again become the victim of a criminal Zionist action. 
[passage omitted] 
  The multisided U.S. support for the occupying Zionist regime 
is an important factor contributing to the inhuman Zionist 
activities. The U.S. move to obstruct and veto the UN Security 
Council resolutions against Israel is an indication of the 
support that that country gives to Israel. Consequently, the 
two-faced policy maintained by the UN Security Council has 
created important opportunities for the Zionist regime and 
allowed it to commit crimes against the Palestinian people. An 
example is the stance the United States adopted after Hebron. 
The U.S. approach prevented the UN Security Council from 
adopting a resolution on the incident. Considering that, the 
international community must express its indignation over the 
issue. 
  The Hebron incident has shown that the sacred Palestinian 
uprising must be strengthened. It has also revealed that the 
Palestinians can safeguard their right to live on their own 
homeland only through an armed struggle.

<F P=106> [Report by Sokhbet Mamedov: "Prosecutor's Office in Baku </F>
Maintains that Coup d'Etat Has Failed"] 
  [Text] Baku -- Around 200 Molotov cocktails, 73 flak 
jackets, 42 grenade launcher rounds, and a large quantity of 
other munitions were removed from the basement of the People's 
Front of Azerbaijan [PFA] headquarters during a search carried 
out by investigative organs. 
  Azerbaijan General Prosecutor Ali Omarov has issued a 
sensational statement: "An attempt to execute an armed coup 
d'etat planned to take place in the republic on 5 March has been 
thwarted by investigative organs." According to him, the 
weapons and munitions seized in the PFA headquarters and in the 
apartments of certain rayon branch leaders had been assembled 
for the coup. 
  The PFA described the Prosecutor's Office actions as a 
provocation. A statement issued by the PFA asserts that "the 
PFA has nothing to do with the weapons found." The version of 
events advanced in the document is that the arms cache was 
planted in the building by the police. 
  Both the statement about an imminent coup and the PFA's 
attempt to dissociate itself from the arsenal in its own 
building are regarded with suspicion in Baku. 
  The opposition has used this episode to attack the 
government. The PFA, the Musavat party, and the Azerbaijan 
Democratic and Independent Democratic Parties have adopted a 
joint statement in which they accuse the republic authorities of 
repressing opposition forces. In their opinion, the authorities 
are doing this to shift the blame for the relentless 
deterioration in the economic and military situation onto their 
opponents' shoulders. 
  The PFA has been in existence six years. It has headed the 
democratic movement in the republic. It held power in 
Azerbaijan from June 1992 through July 1993. However, this 
period was marked by a host of mistakes in both foreign policy 
and the economy, caused the Front to disintegrate into various 
political parties, and hastened the resignation of ex-President 
Abulfaz Elchibey's team. 
  When the PFA was in office it had more than 80,000 members; 
today its ranks have thinned considerably. But even bearing in 
mind the PFA's sapped authority, it is premature to write it 
off. Having adopted its principle of organizational building 
from the Communist Party, the PFA has a ramified network of 
organizations in all rayons and population centers of the 
republic. The unchanged chairman of the Front is ex-President 
Elchibey, who prefers to call it a movement. After his forced 
resignation he withdrew to his home village of Keleki, in the 
Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, and he continues to "lead the 
Front's activity" from there. 
  The PFA was and remains a fervent opponent of Azerbaijan's 
joining the CIS, seeing the Commonwealth as harboring the threat 
of restoration. For that reason and also because it disagrees 
with President Geydar Aliyev's course, the Front, in coalition 
with certain political parties, stands implacably opposed to the 
current authorities. 
  As far as weapons are concerned the Front, particularly in 
the last two years, has had an abundance of them, and it is 
unlikely they have all been voluntarily handed over to the 
law-enforcement agencies. 
  However, this fact can scarcely serve to justify accusing 
the 
Front of preparing an armed coup.

  [Text] Moscow March 9 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and presidential chief of staff Sergey Filatov have 
called off their scheduled meetings with visiting ex-President 
of the United States Richard Nixon. 
  Kremlin sources, who said earlier that President Boris 
Yeltsin's meeting with Nixon was now "problematic", have just 
told ITAR-TASS that the Russian president has refused to meet 
the American visitor. 
  Competent sources told ITAR-TASS that the cancellation of 
these meetings was decided after the former American president 
met former Russian Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy, amnestied 
recently. 
  Nixon's initiative must have been seen as a sign of 
disrespect for the political will of the Russian leadership. 
  On Tuesday, Richard Nixon told journalists that Russian 
authorities had not hampered his contacts with the leaders of 
the oppositional forces. 
  But to all appearances, after demonstrating their democratic 
thinking, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Sergey Filatov reserved the 
right to view Nixon's contacts with opposition leaders, 
including one of the organisers of the armed resistance to 
President Yeltsin last autumn, as they saw fit.

  [Text] The fact that Russian Communist Leader Gennadiy 
Zyuganov met former U.S. President Richard Nixon proves that the 
U.S. leadership wants to "understand Russian reality better." 
This will give a more realistic picture to U.S. official 
circles, the Communist Party's press service announced. 
  Zyuganov pointed out that the Russian Communist Party and 
all 
Russian patriotic movements were "concerned over the inflexible 
approach of the U.S. to Russian political forces and believed 
that the growth in anti-American sentiment in Russia and the 
U.S. unconditional support for the present unpopular executive 
power have something in common." 
  Commenting on the situation in Russia, the Communist leader 
suggested that the shock-therapy policy was dangerous for Russia 
and could provoke social unrest. However, he said the Russian 
Communist Party rejected both the right and the left radicalism 
and was ready to cooperate with any political forces which stood 
for "restoration of a strong Russia as a guarantee for peace and 
stability in the whole world." 
  Nixon had a conversation with former vice president 
Aleksandr 
Rutskoy who had been released on February 26 in accordance with 
the resolution on political amnesty. 
  The ex-U.S. president also met with the leader of the 
Russian 
Unity and Concord's parliamentary faction, Minister for 
Nationalities and Regional Policies, Sergey Shakhray. 
  A meeting between Nixon and the Liberal Democratic Party's 
(LDP) Leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is also expected. 
  As it was earlier reported, the LDP received 63 seats in the 
State Duma after the December parliamentary elections.

  [Text] Moscow, 5 Mar -- There has been encouraging progress 
recently in the Bosnian settlement in several directions. It is 
important to build up on the positive impulse and try to 
reaffirm, rather that lose it, noted Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev on summing up his almost two-hours long 
discussion today with the Prime Minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Haris Silajdzic, who has arrived in Moscow. Russia's top 
diplomat described the talks as fruitful. 
  This positive assessment was also shared by his Bosnian 
counterpart. Saying that there are now prerequisites for 
resolving the conflict, he added: This momentum should not be 
lost. 
  We expect that the Russian Government will play a 
constructive role in continuing the talks on Bosnia, stated 
Silajdzic. Simultaneously, the prime minister spoke in favor of 
a more balanced Russian policy in some aspects of the Yugoslav 
crisis. We hope that the Russian battalion stationed around 
Sarajevo will play a positive role and make it possible to 
preserve the multi-ethnic nature of that city, he went on to say. 
  On the agreement to establish a Croat-Muslim federation, 
which has been achieved, he said that this agreement excludes no 
one. Obviously, its implementation is impossible without the 
Serbs, he pointed out. We made it clear that our agreement will 
also be offered to the Serb side. It is quite possible at the 
same time that now it is not ready to accept it. In this 
scenario, we will develop a new version, but it will still be 
based on the main premise -- the territorial integrity and 
sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Moscow, 9 Mar -- Lately there has been encouraging 
progress in several areas toward a settlement of the Bosnian 
crisis. The important thing now is not to lose, but on the 
contrary, to develop the positive impetus and try to consolidate 
it. This was stressed by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev when he took stock of the almost two-hour long talks he 
held today with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic, who is visiting Moscow. The Russian foreign minister 
described the talks as fruitful and frank. 
  The Bosnian guest shared the positive appraisal. Noting that 
prerequisites have emerged for settling the conflict, Silajdzic 
added: The opportunity must not be lost. It is time to move 
toward the establishment of peace in Bosnia. 
  We expect the Russian Government to play a constructive role 
in the continuation of the talks on Bosnia, Silajdzic said. At 
the same time the prime minister called for Russia to pursue a 
more balanced policy toward certain aspects of the Yugoslav 
crisis. We hope, he added, that the Russian battalion deployed 
around Sarajevo will play a positive role and make it possible 
to preserve Sarajevo as a multiethnic city. 
  For his part, Kozyrev said that Russian diplomacy always 
maintains a balanced stance with regard to the Yugoslav 
conflict. The minister stressed: We reject the discriminatory 
approach to the peoples of the former Yugoslavia and 
particularly Bosnia-Herzegovina. All these peoples and ethnic 
groups are near and dear to the Russians. 
  Regarding the reaching of an accord on the formation of a 
Croatian-Muslim federation, Silajdzic stressed that this 
agreement excludes no one. Of course, he indicated, it could 
not be implemented without the Serbs' consent. We clearly 
stated that our agreement would also be proposed to the Serb 
side. At the same time, it is quite possible that at the moment 
they are not ready to accept it. In that case, we will find 
some other option that is nonetheless based on the main thing -- 
namely the territorial integrity and sovereignty of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Silajdzic said that during his meeting with Kozyrev a whole 
range of issues of bilateral Bosnian-Russian relations were 
discussed. The prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina called, in 
particular, for the development of cultural cooperation. 
  The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned that Silajdzic is to 
depart from Moscow at about 1630 today.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Asia" program] </F>
  [Text] The Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society 
has recently issued a statement in connection with the fact that 
the Seoul authorities have attempted to take Koreans residing in 
Sakhalin to the ROK. Regarding this, Mr. (Yi Genari), chairman 
of the Russian Branch of the Pomminnyon International Committee 
to Promote Korean Reunification, came today to our Moscow radio 
station and spoke as follows: 
  [Begin (Yi Genari) recording, in Russian with simultaneous 
translation into Korean] First of all, I would like to remind 
you that there are approximately 500,000 Koreans in the 
territory of the former USSR. Among them, over 120,000 Koreans 
-- including scholars, artists, well-educated doctors, 
technicians, and agricultural officials -- live in Russia. All 
of them are now living and working in and greatly contributing 
to the economic, scientific, and cultural development of the CIS 
countries. All of them are deeply rooted in this land. 
  Speaking of the Koreans living in Sakhalin, all of them are 
workers who were forcibly taken into Sakhalin by the then 
Japanese imperialist aggressors from North and South Korea 
between 1938 and 1945. After the Japanese imperialists were 
defeated during WW II, the Japanese people who lived in Sakhalin 
were the only ones able to return to their home, but the Koreans 
had to stay there without their jobs. According to data provided 
by the Korean Association in Sakhalin, there are 1,700 Korean 
households in Sakhalin whose members were forced to live there 
before 1945. They are separated from their family members. 
  After receiving the statement issued by the Central 
Committee 
of the DPRK Red Cross Society, I have come to believe that the 
problems of Koreans in Sakhalin should be jointly solved by 
Russia and the DPRK, only after the Japanese Government makes an 
official apology for its past act of forcibly taking them into 
Sakhalin and makes compensations for it. Therefore, the issue of 
Korean immigration from Sakhalin is not a matter of 
humanitarianism as demanded by Seoul, but rather has emerged as 
a political matter. 
  In conclusion, I would like to express my deep appreciation 
to the Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society for the 
protection of the interest of all Koreans, those who live in 
North and South Korea, as well as in foreign countries, 
including the CIS countries. [end recording]

increase of 20 percent in this area. Many link this fact with 
the purchase of Russian tanks. The question of whether India 
will actually purchase tanks from Russia or build them using our 
technology was discussed at a news conference at the Russian 
Ministry of Defense held by Vladimir Semenov, commander of the 
ground forces, as part of a return visit of his Indian 
colleague, Mr. Joshi. [Video shows Colonel Semenov and Joshi 
addressing news conference] 
  The main details pertaining to the signing of the 
Russian-Indian documents will be discussed at the level of the 
ministers of defense of the two countries, but it can already be 
said today that India will become a reliable partner in the 
sphere of exports of Russian military equipment and weapons. 
[Video shows Semenov speaking to camera] 
  [Begin Semenov recording] We have been linked over the past 
34 years by friendly relations in the sphere of military 
technical cooperation. In its time the Soviet Union did much to 
maintain India's defense capability at the proper level. But in 
recent years, the past three or four years, our mutual relations 
have weakened somewhat. The main aim of my visit to India and I 
think the reason for General Joshi's visit to Russia is to 
elevate mutual relations between the Russian Army and the Indian 
Army to a qualitatively new level. [end recording]

  [Text] Russia will "tougher react" to Ukraine's 
unauthorized use of part of Russian gas exported to Western 
Europe, the Russian Economics Ministry told Interfax. 
  According to "Gazprom," Ukraine continues to syphon off up 
to 
25 percent of Russian gas which goes to West Europe through the 
Ukrainian territory. As a result, "Gazprom" has to pay big 
fines to foreign consumers of Russian gas. Russia's hard 
currency losses amount to half a million dollars a day, the 
ministry experts said. 
  Well-informed sources in the same ministry told Interfax 
that 
Russia may demand Kiev pay the fines to foreign partners and 
reimburse its debt for Russian gas already delivered that 
experts estimate at 1.5 Tn rubles. 
  In addition, Moscow intends to demand guarantees of free 
transit of its gas through the Ukrainian territory at the talks 
between the heads of the Russian and Ukrainian gas complexes 
scheduled for March 10.

  [Text] A session of the Georgian parliament today put off 
the consideration of 25 issues previously included in the agenda 
due to its failure to muster a quorum. 
  On the same day, the opposition distributed a statement 
among 
the deputies calling for recognizing the results of the March 1 
vote on Georgia's joining the CIS null and void. 
  On March 1, the parliament ratified the treaty on the 
republic's joining the CIS by a majority of 121 votes, with 47 
votes against and 4 abstentions. 
  According to the opposition, a two-thirds majority, or 145 
votes, rather than a simple majority was required to pass the 
decision. On the whole, the Georgian parliament includes 220 
deputies. 
  At the same time, opponents to the republic's membership in 
the CIS agreed to the proposal by Parliamentary Speaker Vakhtang 
Goguadze to allow international experts to decide on the 
legality of the ratification. 
  Simultaneously, the Social Democratic Party of Georgia which 
supports joining the CIS called on the opposition to regard this 
issue of paramount importance for the republic with due 
understanding. 
  During the session, deputy Tengiz Sigua pointed to the need 
to provide an answer to a recent statement by Armenian Foreign 
Minister Vagan Papazian. In an interview with NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA, the Armenian minister did not rule out the possibility 
of his republic's applying pressure upon Georgia, if goods are 
not promptly delivered to Armenia from the seaports of Batumi 
and Poti. He also demanded an end to acts of sabotage on the 
railroads and pipelines going through the Georgian territory. 
  Sigua described the statement as "diplomatic blackmail and 
policy of intimidation" pointing out that "such a statement by 
an Armenian official must not be left without an adequate 
reaction."

  [Text] The inner political crisis of parliament has 
assumed such a scale that naturally a point of view is being 
publicly shaped out on dissolving parliament and holding new 
parliamentary elections. It could have been considered a 
solution to the crisis if it were not for one most significant 
circumstance: Holding such elections would confirm that the 
Georgian jurisdiction does not apply to some regions. We 
believe that dissolving parliament contradicts the interests of 
Georgia because parliament is the only legitimate body 
confirming Georgia's unity. Therefore, the parliamentary 
majority goes out of its way for retaining the executive 
legislative body of Georgia. 
  Unfortunately, the parliamentary opposition is behaving in 
quite an opposite way. Some representatives of the opposition 
systematically resort to threats, blackmail, and insults which 
becomes unbearable. 
  Therefore, the population thinks that parliament must be 
dissolved. Proceeding from the interests of the country, it is 
crucial that we find ways for coexistence between the majority 
and the opposition. Meanwhile, we declare that we shall react 
lawfully to all instances of insult to personal honor. 
  [Signed] The council of the parliamentary majority. 
  [Dated] Tbilisi, 8 March, 1994.

  [Text] A military and technical concept for developing 
weapons and military equipment until the year 2000, as well as a 
state armaments program, have been discussed at a meeting of the 
Defense Ministry Collegium. Participants in the meeting stated 
that the second stage in scaling down and restructuring the 
Belarusian Army was completed in 1992 to 1993, which brought the 
size of the Belarusian Armed Forces down to nearly the levels 
specified by international agreements. Again noted were 
difficulties with recruiting enough troops, caused by the 
specific demographic situation in Belarus, the Chernobyl 
aftermath, and the anti-Army campaign launched by some media.

  [Text] On 8 March, Stanislav Shushkevich, ex-speaker of the 
Belarusian Supreme Soviet, visited Soligorsk. Regardless of the 
holiday, city residents filled the Miners' Palace of Culture to 
almost full capacity. The ex-speaker declined to 
straightforwardly answer questions from the audience of whether 
his recent trips to Belarusian cities mark the beginning of his 
presidential campaign. However, he did say that democratic 
forces in the Republic should nominate a single candidate for 
the upcoming elections to secure a greater probability of 
victory. Stanislav Shushkevich also spoke positively of the 
unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems, as 
well as of the economic achievements of the Baltic countries. 
Despite discontent with the policy of the government and 
Supreme Soviet, the former Supreme Soviet chairman spoke against 
a political strike with plant and factory stoppages.

  [Text] The parliamentary and local elections held in 
Kazakhstan on March 7 failed to conform to international legal 
standards, a representative of the Bureau for Democratic 
Institutions and Human Rights of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), Elizabeth Winship, told a news 
conference in Almaty on Tuesday. 
  During the elections, six CSCE teams visited more than 50 
polling stations in Almaty, Kapchagai, Issyk and other cities to 
supervise their opening and closing and the counting of votes. 
  Winship's conclusion that the elections were undemocratic is 
based on the fact that political parties and movements and 
individual candidates did not have enough time to organize their 
election campaigns, while an entangled candidate registration 
procedure provoked offenses on the part of constituency 
electoral commissions. 
  In addition, the national roll compiled by President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev ensured 20 percent of seats in the future 
parliament for government officials, according to the CSCE 
experts. 
  There were registered cases where one person voted for 
several candidates. CSCE experts revealed instances where 
electoral commission members forged or replaced ballots. The 
Central Electoral Commission also withdrew independent 
candidates under unconvincing pretexts. There were cases when 
local authorities put pressure on electoral commissions, Winship 
said. 
  But the main flaw of the elections was that "many electors 
did not understand the system of voting and voted simultaneously 
for several candidates," the CSCE experts said. In some towns, 
such as Kapchagai, located only 60 km from Almaty, some pollling 
stations were closed, which prevented about 5,000 people from 
voting. 
  Besides, the independent media had limited access to 
information on the elections, Winship said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov, and KAZTAG </F>
correspondent Marat Kaliyev] 
  [Text] Almaty March 9 TASS -- Observers from the delegation 
of the parliamentary assembly of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the international electoral 
systems foundation and a number of foreign countries, who 
monitored the republic's election campaign and polling, drew a 
categorical conclusion that, according to Western standards, 
Monday's elections in Kazakhstan were accompanied with an array 
of most flagrant violations in the procedure for a free 
expression of people's will and, it means, the election results 
should be recognised as invalid. 
  A list of election monitors' complaints, made available to 
the KAZTAG news agency on Wednesday, includes ten main points. 
Observers complained about the complexity of the republic's 
candidates registration system, the existence of a state list of 
contenders for parliament seats, the vagueness of the programmes 
of many candidates, and their poor coverage in local news media. 
  A group of observers monitoring the work of the Central 
Electoral Commission recognised it as unsatisfactory, listing as 
inadmissible for pluralistic democratic elections such 
irregularities as the casting of votes by one and the same 
person for himself and his relatives, the delivery of 
ballot-boxes to the homes of a number of voters, the lack of 
guards at some polling stations. 
  Foreign monitors were particularly angered by the fact that 
they were not given an opportunity to visit a number of military 
facilities where polling took place. They believe could harbour 
possibilities for various kinds of irregularities. 
  ITAR-TASS and KAZTAG correspondents requested commission 
chairman Karatai Turysov to comment on foreign observers' 
complaints. He said all the complaints are now being thoroughly 
scrutinised and appropriate explanations will be given either 
later on Wednesday or early on Thursday. 
  "Personally, I am not inclined to overdramatise the 
situation 
," Turysov said. "when evaluating polling arrangements, one 
should proceed from Kazakhstan's current realities. To ignore 
them is to take a prejudiced position beforehand." 
  "Take, for example, voting on the state list. This procedure 
was laid down by the previous self-dissolved parliament and to 
ignore it would be a direct breach of the current legislation. 
  "The same can be applied to polling taking place in some 
military units. Appropriate regulations for the guarding of 
state secrets make particularly secret defence facilities off 
limits to foreign observers. Polling there was personally 
monitored by members of district electoral commissionsm," 
Turysov said. 
  Incidentally, many other foreign observers, who hold more 
realistic positions -- those from France, Russia, Turkmenistan, 
and a number of other countries -- are well aware of that. 
  French Ambassador Bertrand Fessard de Foucault told the 
correspondents that he viewed arrangements for and the first 
results of the elections as an obvious success of young 
Kazakhstan democracy.

  [Text] Secretary of Kazakhstan's Central Election committee 
Lyudmila Artamonova called the statement of the CSCE 
supervisors, stating that elections to the parliament and local 
power bodies in Kazakhstan do not correspond to international 
legal norms, as "extremely tactless." In her interview with 
Interfax she expressed the opinion that supervisors had no right 
to stage a press conference and give their assessment of the 
elections having not informed the Central Elections commission 
about their remarks beforehand. 
  At a press conference held in Almaty Tuesday representative 
of the CSCE bureau on democratic institutes and human rights 
Elizabeth Winship declared that the elections to the parliament 
and local power bodies held in Kazakhstan March 7 do not 
correspond to international legal norms. 
  At the same time Artamonova asserts, that during an official 
reception staged after the press conference leader of the CSCE 
delegation Jean van Nowling declared during his private 
conversation with chairman of the Central Election Committee 
Karatay Turysov that supervisors "have no special remarks." 
  Member of the Central Election Commission Talgatbek 
Abaydildin also qualifies statements of foreign supervisors as 
tactless. In his interview with Interfax he declared that one 
cannot judge about the democratic standards observed at 
elections in the whole republic basing on 3-4 facts of 
violations. 
  Well-informed sources in Kazakhstan's leadership in Almaty 
reported to Interfax that the republic's Foreign Ministry, in 
particular, is examining a statement of the CSCE supervisors and 
is going to present its answer in the near term.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksander Lebed, commander in chief of the </F>
14th Russian Army, by Rostislav Khotin and Dmitriy Mosiyenko; in 
Tiraspol; date not given: "Not Long Ago We Were Citizens of One 
State, Therefore We Can Gain an Understanding More Quickly and 
Easily Than Any Americans, Germans, and Englishmen..."] 
  [Text] General Lebed, 43, is one of the most prominent 
stars on the military horizon of the former Soviet Union. A 
regular officer with 25 years of experience and an Afghan War 
veteran, he consolidated his position and influence both in 
Moldova and Moscow during the armed conflict between Kishinev 
and Tiraspol in 1992. This is why he can take the liberty of 
making judgments that do not become military officials, and 
particularly commanders of foreign troops... People have 
different opinions about General Lebed, ranging from a boorish 
soldier to a man capable of replacing Pavel Grachev. General 
Lebed gave an interview on the eve of legislative elections in 
Moldova at the 14th Russian Army Headquarters in Tiraspol, 
sitting under the Russian flag and a large poster depicting the 
Kremlin. We preserved the general's style of speech throughout 
the interview. 
  [KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI] Comrade commander, Moldovan President 
Mircea Snegur said he would press for the complete withdrawal of 
Russian troops from Moldova in 1994... 
  [Lebed] I got you. As they say, desires do not always match 
abilities. When I am asked whether it is good when the Army of 
one state is on the territory of another state, I answer "no." 
Should it be pulled out? Yes, it should. 
  When it should be pulled out is a separate question. This 
should be done when all political and economic conditions for 
the pullout are in place; when, for example, one can get a 
sufficient number of trains here and then dispatch them to new 
stationing sites so that local women do not assault our units, 
as was the case before... Those conditions are not yet met! Why 
not? Just because a year and a half of peace brought no 
results; negotiations are in a deadlock with no progress in 
sight. As for economic conditions, Shevardnadze from Georgia 
babbled much about them -- hundreds of thousands of officers are 
left without jobs, apartments, and any prospects for the future. 
This kind of withdrawal is even more unacceptable. There is 
also a diplomatic side to the whole problem. What would Ukraine 
say, if I started to transport weapons and ammunition through 
its territory? After all, its railroads will be jammed with 
dangerous cargo. There is a technical side to this problem. 
Considering the railroads and loading sites available and the 
huge amount of weapons, this transportation would require two 
solid years of around-the-clock work -- day and night, and no 
holidays... So, who can ever talk here about the summer of 
1994? Besides, you cannot utilize the ammunition here. They 
would not listen to any arguments, and only go like, Get out of 
here and period. I think it is an election campaign ploy. 
  [KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI] Some politicians -- in particular, 
Brigitte Schultz who is the leader of a NATO group observing 
elections in Moldova -- believe that the presence of the 14th 
Russian Army in the Dniester region will complicate Russia's 
participation in the "Partnership for Peace." 
  [Lebed] Brigitte Schultz is no authority to me. Besides, 
women should move their butts out of this place, and not stick 
their noses into the dog's turd. She is threatening us? Let 
her come down here and try to pull this Army out. The former 
Soviet Army withdrew from Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, 
Germany, Mongolia, and Cuba. This was the first wave, and then 
the second one followed. The withdrawal of the Western Group of 
Troops is to be completed by 1 September, and the Northwestern 
Group of Troops is now being withdrawn from the Baltics. All 
this crush of officers, warrant officers, military equipment, 
and wild homeless officers... With a severe economic crisis 
crippling Russia and Ukraine, this problem will not be solved 
quickly. And it must be solved in a civilized manner. When the 
British Rhein Army had to be pulled out from Germany two years 
ago, the British estimated that this would require nine years. 
Germans checked it out and agreed. This is what I call a 
civilized approach. 
  [KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI] Who could replace the 14th Army in 
the future? UN peacekeeping forces, maybe? 
  [Lebed] Let us take it for granted that not long ago, we 
were citizens of one state, therefore we can come to terms more 
quickly and easily than any Americans, Germans, or Englishmen. 
Take, for example, the trilateral peacekeeping posts of 
Russians, Dniester Russians, and Moldovans. If they want to get 
smashed, they do it together, so there are no ethnic problems 
among them. Their commanders know each other, too, because they 
used to serve in the same army. 
  A steady balance of forces has been established in this 
region. If you drastically disturb it... For example, suppose 
there is no 14th Army as of tomorrow. This will immediately 
instigate a temptation to solve long-standing problems in one 
fell swoop. Someone will have to fill the vacuum. No action, 
however tough and swift, can be victorious. That is a tough 
place around here -- everyone would always owe something to 
everyone. European borders were drawn and redrawn after 
numerous wars. Here, you can prove that white is either white 
or black, depending on how old your map is. This is why this 
place can become another Yugoslavia. Personally, I don't see any 
possibility as to how to pull my Army out of this region. Even 
if someone new comes tomorrow to lead it, he would not see, 
either. 
  The humiliatingly short record time for withdrawal from 
foreign countries often brought about a problem of, say, how to 
dissolve a division in two months. Servicemen were asked then 
where they came from. Are you guys from Tiraspol? Come to the 
14th Army commander, he will find you a place. As a result, 51 
percent of officers and 79 percent of warrant officers in my 
Army come from this region. This is one whole jumble -- the 
Army is Russian, its commander's last name is Lebed, his combat 
deputy is Melnychuk, and his logistic deputy is Perepadya. All 
of them have numerous relatives in nearby Ukraine. Generally 
speaking, this is paranoia that needs to be blown away as soon 
as possible. Ukrainians, Russians, Belarusians are all Slavs 
with one fate, blood, and faith. We should think of what unites 
us, and not the other way around. What we are doing right now 
is separating them as Siamese twins that have two heads and one 
body. If separated, both of them will be nothing but hideous 
freaks. So, we are working now on the freaks. 
  [KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI] What are the relations between the 
14th 
Army command and the Dniester leadership? 
  [Lebed] Relations with the Dniester Republic of Moldova 
[PRM] 
have never been cloudless. They introduced some dumb money and 
meddled in someone else's business by sending some hundred 
soldiers to the White House in October. They bring in some 
citizenship and pass weird laws, privatizing the 30-km-stretch 
of the Russian gas pipe line in the region. They took under 
their jurisdiction the air space over their republic without 
even having an airport and planes. I refused to be a PRM deputy 
because I am against the boorish interference with affairs of 
the state that I serve. It is up to Russia what president and 
parliament to elect. No Swedes, Czechs, or Dniester residents 
have the right to decide this.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Galina Gridneva and </F>
Aleksandr Kharchenko] 
  [Text] Dushanbe, 8 Mar -- It is now virtually impossible 
for journalists to obtain objective information from official 
sources about the situation in the former Kurgan-Tyube oblast. 
In recent days, the sociopolitical situation in Kurgan-Tyube 
and neighboring districts has become especially explosive. 
Local observers believe that, in spite of all decisions taken 
by the Dushanbe authorities on the disbanding and disarming of 
various paramilitary groups, these groups do not intend to hand 
over their weapons. Therefore, the possibility cannot be ruled 
out that the Government of Tajikistan may resort to force within 
the next few days as a way of resolving the conflict. 
  ITAR-TASS learned from military sources that the body of a 
former field commander of the People's Front of Tajikistan, 
Talat Mirusmanov, was discovered yesterday on the road linking 
Kurgan- Tyube and Dushanbe. Until November last year he was 
chief of staff of a special police unit deployed in 
Kurgan-Tyube. Mirusmanov was shot by unknown gunmen. The 
motive for the killing is being investigated by the republic's 
law enforcement agencies. However, local observers do not rule 
out the possibility that Talat Mirusmanov became the latest 
victim of violence amongst various armed groups in the former 
Kurgan-Tyube oblast. The Government of Tajikistan has virtually 
no control over these groups. Ten people, including Mirzo 
Saidov, chief of staff of a special Tajik defense ministry 
brigade, and Zargorov, an employee of the international 
nongovernmental organization, Medecins Sans Frontieres, have 
already died in the violence during the past month.

  [Text] Tehran, March 9, IRNA -- In the wake of talks 
between Russian officials and Tajik opposition leaders in Tehran 
this week, head of the Tajik opposition Akbar Tourjanzadeh 
announced today that his group would hold direct talks with the 
government of Tajikistan. 
  He said the talks that are to be held with the coordination 
of the United Nations it is agreed that the representatives of 
Russia, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan will participate as 
mediators. 
  Tourjanzadeh said that in the talks with Russian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin on March 6 and 7, the two 
sides discussed the possibility of direct talks with the 
government in Dushanbe. 
  He said the goal of the opposition is to delegate power to 
the representatives of the people of Tajikistan. 
  He appreciated the position of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
for solving the problem in his Central Asian homeland and said 
the people of Tajiksitan have a lot of common grounds with the 
people of Iran. 
  According to Tourjanzadeh Russia has proposed that it will 
not play any role except to gather the representatives of the 
opposition and the government of Dushanbe under the supervision 
of the United Nations. 
  He said the Russians also ask for continuous talks on a 
periodical basis in Moscow and Islamabad and Tehran "but we 
require that the talks be only on a periodical basis in Tehran 
and Moscow with a final agreement to be signed in Tehran, 
because Iran has been the first country that declared its 
readiness for that purpose."

  [Text] Latvian Ambassador to the United States Ojars 
Kalnins presented a note to the U.S. State Department asking for 
a clarification of statements by U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher relating to Latvia, made by Warren Christopher to a 
subcommittee of the U.S. Senate at the beginning of the month. 
The note says Latvia is perplexed by what was said by the head 
of the U.S. State Department, that almost a million Russian 
speakers in Latvia are deprived of the right to vote. The 
Foreign Ministry recalls that 278,000 out of 722,000 ethnic 
Russians living in Latvia are citizens of the Republic of 
Latvia. 
  It is noted that Warren Christopher accepted Russia's right 
to provoke Latvians to extend the circle of citizens and grant 
the voting right to Russians who want to live in Latvia. The 
Latvian Foreign Ministry is worried that Russians will interpret 
these remarks as acceptance of the effort to (?fix) Latvia's 
citizenship and naturalization policy. The document emphasized 
that the Foreign Ministry wants to clarify Warren Christopher's 
comments on the withdrawal of the Russian Army from Latvia and 
the Skrunda radar base. The U.S. Secretary of State (?had twice 
noted) the necessity of preserving the Russian troops at 
Skrunda, while hitherto Latvia has been convinced that the U.S. 
supports its efforts to demilitarize the Skrunda site. The 
remarks by the Secretary of State make one think the opposite. 
  The Foreign Ministry urges a meeting of diplomatic 
representatives of Latvia and the USA to clarify their stances 
on the issues referred to, and to avert any possible 
misunderstandings.

  [Text] [Announcer] Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs returned 
from Sweden and held a news conference immediately afterwards. 
Regarding what was said, go ahead, Guntis [Scerbinskis]: 
  [Scerbinskis] Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs reported on his 
visit. In Stockholm he had several important meetings. The 
first one that must be mentioned is the meeting with the prime 
ministers of the five Nordic countries, and here the main thing 
to note is that a new stable element is entering Europe, the 
five plus three. That is, the five Nordic countries plus the 
three Baltic countries. 
  The Nordic prime ministers expressed support for the quick, 
orderly, and complete withdrawal of the Russian Army from 
Latvia. Support was also expressed for Latvia's constructive 
position on the Skrunda issue, and the wording was that it is a 
significant investment by Latvia in the security of all of 
Northern Europe. The Nordic prime ministers likewise expressed 
support for Latvia's efforts to enter the European Union, and 
evidently there will be a speeding up of the signing of 
treaties, in the two trade treaties with the European Union. 
  What should also be mentioned is the meeting at a bipartite 
level with Sweden. What was discussed here were the issues of 
ports, an agricultural protocol, as well as the Baltic 
peacekeeping battalion possibly being trained in Sweden. 
Besides that, an interesting offer was made concerning weapons, 
and the Swedes are offering to locate arms manufacturing in 
Latvia. But (?that is still a job) for military experts. The 
third point that must be mentioned was a meeting between the 
prime ministers of the three Baltic countries. Here the main 
points that must be mentioned were consultations with Estonia 
about retired military personnel. It was also decided that 
Estonia is to prepare conditions for a competition for 
(?demarcating) the border for all the Baltic lands, since 
Estonia has gone furthest in this work. 
  [Announcer] So, Guntis Scerbinskis outlined the news 
conference held today by Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs upon his 
return from Sweden.

  [Text] The Latvia's National Independence Movement (LNNK) 
faction proposed to cease broadcasting of some of the 
"Ostankino" programmes. The newspaper NEATKARIGA CINA reported. 
The programme "Sunday" was mentioned as one of the reasons for 
such a proposal, which said that the books distributed in Latvia 
as text-books express approval of how the Jews issue was solved 
during the World War Two. The faction proposed to conclude a new 
agreement with the "Ostankino" company on broadcasting only some 
of their programmes in Latvia.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 05, BNS -- Latvia considers Russian gas 
export concern GAZPROM prices for gas, 80 U.S. dollars for 1000 
cubic meters, to be too high, Latvian Prime Minister Valdis 
Birkavs informed Friday [4 March] GAZPROM board's Deputy 
Chairman Valeriy Remizov and Director General Pjotr Rodionov. 
  The representatives of GAZPROM arrived Friday in Riga to 
sign 
a new contract with Latvia for year 1994. 
  Latvia considers the price for gas should be smaller because 
Russia uses Incukalns underground gas repository. 
  In return Russia demands that Latvia did payments for gas 
beforehand. 
  BNS already reported that GAZPROM breached February 11, 1993 
a contract on gas supply with the three Baltic states and 
GAZPROM branch company LENTRANSGAZ. 
  During the meeting the representatives of GAZPROM named 
Latvia's 23 million U.S. dollars debt to the organization and 
necessity to centralize all payments to be the main reasons for 
the breaching of contract. 
  Birkavs informed that Latvian Government has given 
permission 
to use Japanese export-import bank's loan (which is part of G-24 
credit given to Latvia) for paying back the debt. 
  Lithuanian state enterprise LIETUVAS GAZE signed Thursday 
agreement on cooperation with GAZPROM. According to the 
agreement, Lithuania will receive 2.7 billion cubic meters of 
natural gas paying 75 U.S. dollars for one thousand cubic meters 
of gas.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Kuchina] </F>
  [Text] Riga, 5 Mar -- An agreement on this year's gas 
supplies was reached between Latvia and the Russian Gazprom 
today. Their volume will remain on the same level and the price 
for 1,000 cubic meters will be $78, which is more than Lithuania 
and Estonia will be paying. Moscow representatives also visited 
Estonia this week. 
  According to Adrians Davis, the general director of Latvijan 
Gaze, the neighbors received a price reduction because of the 
fact that Estonia has set up a joint venture with Lentransgaz, 
in which the Russian partner has more than 30 percent of shares 
was taken into account. 
  Lithuania is also preparing for a similar step. Latvia, for 
the time being, is contemplating whether it should share 
property. 
  At the same time Davis said that compared with other 
countries Latvia was regarded as a relatively safe customer. It 
will pay off its debt of $23 million by next week. There is 
also a government decision to grant funds using the credit from 
the Japanese Export-Import Bank. 
  In the opinion of the general director of Latvijan Gaze, the 
talks were successful. He particularly mentioned the prospects 
for signing a long-term treaty for 10-15 years, which was 
extremely important for Latvia.

<F P=106> [Article by Janis Domburs: "The Black Market in Radioactive </F>
Material is Expanding"] 
  [Excerpts] There is no evidence either to prove or disprove 
reports that caesium and rubid purchased by Rimmele and Eichler 
[not further identified] were brought to Latvia before being 
transported to Cloten airport in Switzerland. Nonetheless, 
before this event even occurred, police and special services in 
West Europe had begun to pay attention to the fact that 
following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the trade in 
contraband radioactive material from the East has grown 
considerably. Latvia has no choice -- it is situated directly 
between the global powers of East and West. Is it inevitable 
that it should become a transit corridor for such contraband? 
  "Last year, even INTERPOL became anxious over the trade in 
radioactive metals; principally, Germany. Now reunited with 
East Germany, the Germans are evidently aware, better than 
anyone else, that these materials were available to the special 
services which were linked throughout East Europe. And these 
relations are still vivid...," this is how Juris Jasinkevics, 
head of Latvia's national bureau of the international police 
organization INTERPOL, sums up the situation. Thus far, his 
bureau has not been tasked by his colleagues in other countries 
to investigate possible trade in radioactive metals here in 
Latvia. Over the last half a year, only one concrete case has 
been uncovered. The inquiry, which came from Germany, was 
connected with a car which was stopped at the German-Polish 
border while trying to return after delivering a load of so- 
called colored metals to Germany; border police detected 
radioactive traces in the car. In this case, the only link to 
Latvia was the fact that the car turned out to be the property 
of a Latvian company. In the export of these so-called colored 
metals, Latvia had been the transit country -- the load was 
delivered from Russia through Belarus. The reason for the 
radioactive traces remains unexplained, because German police 
had not been able to find where the load had been delivered. 
  The fact that a special working group on trade in 
radioactive 
metals was established by the Ministry of Home Affairs in 
January, is evidence that the significance of the problem is 
actually growing. INTERPOL has organized two international 
conferences on criminal activity linked with environmental 
pollution and illegal trade in radioactive material. Copies of 
the reports are in the possession of the Latvian bureau and they 
reveal that at the last such meeting held in Lyons in September, 
it was the German representative who expressed extreme anxiety 
over the sharp increase in the number of such crimes in Germany. 
At the same time, he drew attention to the fact that in cases 
where the presence of radioactive elements was suspected, 
radioactivity was actually detected in relatively few instances 
(in 1992 -- 18 out of 158 inspections). He stated that material 
often toted as radioactive, is in being sold by taking advantage 
of prospect buyer's credulity. Among every case when 
radioactivity was actually detected, there has not been a single 
case of material being discovered which could be used in the 
production of nuclear weapons, which is the most dreaded 
scenario. In reports delivered at INTERPOL conferences, "Red 
Mercury," as an example, is most often mentioned. As DIENA has 
already reported, citing German press reports, this was the 
material Johann Rimmele supposedly had been planning to buy in 
China. There are different opinions concerning its usage. 
INTERPOL experts are of the opinion that "Red Mercury" is a 
material which can be used as an element in making detonators 
for plutonium-based bombs. The German and Dutch representatives 
at INTERPOL directed attention toward Russia as a source of the 
trade in dangerous materials. The Dutch representative 
emphasized the participation of former Red Army officers -- it 
is understood that they are cheating, by selling relatively 
useless goods as strategic material. [passage omitted] 
  Dzintars Kalnins is the head engineer of the Center for 
Nuclear Research at the Latvian Academy of Science in Salaspils 
-- an institution where Latvia's most highly qualified 
specialists in this field are working. Therefore, the 
explanations and comments of Dz. Kalnins can evidently be 
treated as the opinion of a Latvian expert. 
  First of all, it should be stated precisely that the 
valuable materials involved in the famous Lake Constance episode 
were not simply rare metals, but enriched isotopes. They are 
made by growing them in a crystal reticle. Isotopes are applied 
in precise technologies, in radio electronics, computer 
techniques, etc., where the respective isotopes -- perfect, 
precise atom crystals -- are necessary. In Latvia, such 
isotopes are not being manufactured, due to lack of necessary 
equipment. As Mr. Kalnins told us, the institutes which possess 
the special equipment needed to enrich these elements are 
situated near Moscow. "These institutes are practically under 
military management -- so it was during the time of the Soviet 
Union, and so it is now, that in the field of exact sciences, at 
least in this branch, the military line is being developed in 
the first order" -- he said. [passage omitted] 
  To the question of what amount of rare metal contraband 
there 
is in Latvia and if there are inspection facilities to detect 
radioactive material at the border, the answer of the expert was 
skeptical -- he allows for the fact that customs officers, for 
the sake of financial benefit or due to a lack of knowledge, 
often "turn a blind eye." Also, they do not have adequate 
equipment to detect radioactive shipments. Naturally, at the 
airport any isotope -- radioactive or otherwise -- would be 
discovered by a common detector, since it is a metal... 
Nevertheless, the situation in radioactive control is hopeful 
-- at the Center for Nuclear Research there is a laboratory 
being established, where the certification and attestation of 
radioactivity detecting devices will be possible. There are also 
plans to organize training for customs officers and border 
guards in this laboratory. Judging by what Dz. Kalnins said, 
customs officers and border guards are not the only ones having 
problems: Recently, some kind of "mafiosi" called me and, not 
revealing their names, offered me a great amount money to check 
the radioactivity of some metal in their possession. I replied 
that I do not make deals with anonymous people... 
  A rhetorical question could be put as to whether it would 
not be in Russia's interests if there were strict controls over 
the export of isotopes? 
  "Of course, and I am sure they would do it gladly, but I 
suppose that the Mafia has grabbed it in her hands" -- answered 
Dzintars Kalnins. 
  To be continued...

  [Text] Riga, Mar 07, BNS -- The Latvian National Bank 
plans to keep its eyes peeled on the money supply to avert price 
hike and cut inflation to 10 percent in 1994, the bank's 
President Einars Repse said Saturday [5 March]. 
  In 1993, the inflation ran a comparatively low 34.9 percent, 
Repse told the economic development seminar at the Economics 
Ministry. In Estonia, prices increased 35 percent, in Lithuania 
288 percent, in Russia 1,000 percent and in Belarus 1,060 
percent. 
  Only some of East European countries, like the Czech 
Republic 
(18 percent) and Slovakia (23 percent), reported lower inflation 
rate than Latvia last year, Repse said. 
  The Bank of Latvia's main short-term goals are stabilizing 
of 
prices and currency, and raising credibility in the national 
currency, the lat, said Repse. 
  Latvia managed to stop the decline in its gross domestic 
product in 1993, Repse noted. 
  The central bank is aware of the negative impact of the 
national currency revaluation on the export opportunities, said 
Repse. It preserved a stable currency market by preventing 
sharp increase and fluctuations in the lat rate. 
  The measures helped the Baltic country to lead its foreign 
trade balance back in the black, Repse said. 
  On the other hand, Repse conceded that the economy reacts 
inflexibly to changes in currency rates. The chances of market 
relations are not fully used in Latvia yet, he added. 
  Commenting on the influx of convertible currencies into 
Latvia, Repse said that the acquired reserves would allow to 
avoid sharp fluctuations in the lat rate and grant some safety 
to the national currency in the future.

<F P=106> [Interview with Estonian President Lennart Meri by </F>
Frederikas Jansonas in Tallinn on 23 February: "The Day of Sun, 
Hope, and Happiness"] 
  [Excerpts] Today, the Republic of Estonia is celebrating 
the 76th anniversary of its independence. The flags of 
neighboring states will fly not only in Tallinn, but also in 
Vilnius, because it is our common holiday. The Estonian 
president will make a festive speech this evening. On the eve 
of this holiday, his Excellency Lennart Meri answered some 
questions from RESPUBLIKA reporter Frederikas Jansonas. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Jansonas]Mr. President, former communists are 
returning to power in many East European countries. They call 
this a shift from romanticism to realism. You have never been a 
member of the Communist Party. Does this mean that you are a 
romantic? 
  [Meri] Yes.... I have been fortunate or maybe unfortunate -- 
this is for you to decide -- to be a writer. My critics, in 
Estonia or Finland or Germany, often accuse me of being a 
romantic (laughs).... 
  However, this is hardly the reply that you expect to hear 
from me. Yes, the return of former forces to power is becoming 
a tendency in Central Europe. (By the way, I have never used 
the term East Europe because, in my opinion, East Europe is 
primarily Russia. East Europe is to the east of the borders of 
Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Hungary). 
  First of all, we should study why such a tendency has 
emerged. 
  It is absolutely clear that such foreign secret services of 
the Russian Federation as the KGB or the Chief Intelligence 
Administration continue to operate. If they are expanding their 
activities in the United States, Canada, France, Sweden, or 
Finland, it would be somewhat naive to think that Lithuania, 
Latvia, or Estonia would be an exception. It is also evident 
and commonplace that some Russian political groups are 
desperately trying, and will continue to try to revive their 
economic and political influence not only on the Baltic states, 
but by "step after step" on the entire region which they have 
become accustomed to call the "Warsaw Pact countries." 
  On the other hand, we are freeing ourselves of the Soviet 
economic model, and this is a painful process that must be 
completed as soon as possible. We can liken the 
de-Sovietization of the economy to a complicated surgery 
performed without anesthesia. 
  Moreover, we cannot forget that after those 50 years, we are 
like children who just finished secondary school. I remember 
quite well how I myself felt as a school graduate -- it seemed 
that I knew everything about the entire world. True, my 
feelings were quite the opposite when I graduated university. 
The current authorities of Central European states have 
acquired their knowledge about democracy and a market economy 
not through experience, but by reading theoretical books written 
by outstanding authors who live in Paris and receive their 
salaries from one of the 200 or so Soviet Union research 
institutes in the United States. 
  I do not want to say anything negative about these books. 
The tragic thing is, however, that they are theoretical and 
abstract, while we must do something that has never been done in 
the history of mankind. 
  Even such classic countries as Germany do not have a market 
economy that existed in Great Britain during the times of Queen 
Victoria. Unfortunately, we often overlook such "details," 
which inevitably causes social problems. 
  The current problem is whether the price we must pay for the 
leap from one economic system to another will not become an 
explosion interrupting this surgery. 
  The Soviet Union does not exist on geographic maps or in the 
Soviet Army. However, it does exist, as A. Christie said, in 
the matter that every one of us has between our temples. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Jansonas] The "Partnership for Peace" program has been 
the political issue of the last two months. It has evoked very 
different assessments from Central European states. What is 
your view of this program? 
  [Meri] I have already mentioned to one reporter that it 
reminds me of a nice bottle of "Channel" perfume, which seems to 
be empty, or -- and this is even worse -- filled with Mr. 
Molotov's favorite eau de cologne, "Krasnaya Moskva" [Red 
Moscow]. 
  Nevertheless, this is much better than nothing, although it 
does not provide any security guarantees. A difficult 
transitional period is in store for all of us, and we must 
honestly say this to our nations. 
  I have never expected anyone to provide us with certain 
security guarantees before we show that we intend to defend 
ourselves. One cannot wait for security guarantees as if they 
were a Christmas gift. 
  [Jansonas]There have been many different ideas about 
economic and political cooperation among Lithuania, Latvia, and 
Estonia. Mr. V. Landsbergis [opposition leader in Lithuania] 
has even spoken about an Eslalia project -- something similar to 
Benelux -- on the Baltic Sea. What is your attitude toward the 
past, the present, and the future of Baltic cooperation? 
  [Meri] This is one of the key issues for our country. If we 
cooperate only in searching for security guarantees or foreign 
policy issues, everything may remain bare rhetoric. We must all 
understand that in our geopolitical situation we can cooperate 
in resolving security issues and foreign policy only on a common 
economic basis. This is a painful process -- Europe wasted more 
than 30 years before it created the European Union [EU]. 
  I hope that the process of economic integration among the 
Baltic states will be easier. First of all, we have a tragic 
historical experience when before World War II our economies 
competed among themselves rather than cooperated. In my 
opinion, the second reason is that sometimes it is better to be 
a small state -- in this way we can maneuver better and more 
promptly. 
  I explained my position during the very first meetings with 
Latvian and Lithuanian leaders: We must begin our economic 
cooperation by integrating our energy systems. Knowing that 
Finland will face a shortage of energy resources in the coming 
five years, seeing the industrial potential in eastern Germany, 
and bearing in mind the fact that Poland depends on gas imports 
from Russia while the latter's situation is extremely unstable, 
we have a possibility of creating a basis for the future 
integration through a gas pipeline running from Norway to 
eastern Germany through Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and 
Poland. 
  We cannot expect to become EU members before we begin our 
economic cooperation. No one will understand such an attitude 
in the West, where some people have difficulty in telling the 
difference between the Balkan and the Baltic states as it is. 
  As the conclusions of EU experts show, of the three Baltic 
states, Estonia has made the greatest economic progress toward 
the EU. However, we do not intend to boast about this. The 
most important issue is which country will join the EU last, 
rather than first. 
  Apart from other positive aspects, the integration of the 
Baltic energy systems would help us free ourselves from our 
dependence on Russia. The feeling of independence would allow 
us to look at Russia in a considerably friendlier manner, 
because it will always be our neighbor. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Address by Estonian Foreign Affairs Minister Juri Luik at </F>
the Swedish Institute of International Affairs in Stockholm on 2 
March] 
  [Text] Ladies and Gentlemen: It is a pleasure to be able 
to speak to this distinguished forum on a topic of concern to 
all of us, namely cooperation and security in the Baltic Sea 
region. However, we in Estonia believe that security in our 
corner of the world is integral to European security in a wider 
sense. We are at the frontier of democratic and free-market 
thinking prevalent among our closest neighbours, with whom we 
share a shoreline. At the same time we share a border with a 
very unstable giant to the east. The well-known Russian 
democrat Yuriy Afanasyev expressed his doubts about the giant's 
future in yesterday's "Herald Tribune" when he wrote that 
"today, a struggle for power is under way. One order is leaving 
and the other has yet to arrive. The noise of the times again 
resounds as it did in 1917". 
  In this context Sweden's Prime Minister Carl Bildt 
eloquently 
expressed the need for added security in this -- our -- region 
in his address to this forum last November when he said, and I 
quote, "It should be obvious that a pattern of development in 
which all the Nordic countries become part of an emergent 
European Union [EU], thus making the three Baltic States part of 
its `Near Abroad' also in a purely geographic sense, will 
strengthen security throughout the Baltic and North European 
area" (end of quote). 
  I could not agree more, and would go a step further by 
submitting to you that security in the Baltic Sea region is a 
prerequisite both for stability and for extended prosperity in 
the whole of Europe. In making this argument, I will highlight 
three areas of particular interest: first, our security 
concerns at home; second, recent domestic and foreign policy 
developments in Russia; third, the role of the Baltic Sea region 
in a transforming Europe; and fourth, the ongoing transformation 
of Western economic, political and security structures. 
  In Estonia, the highlight of the summer is usually St. 
John's 
Eve on the 24 of June, a holiday which the Teutonic Knights 
borrowed and Christianized but which is actually derived from 
the pagan celebration of the summer solstice. This year, 
however, the highlight of the summer is likely to fall on 31 
August, when the last occupying soldier is due to leave Estonian 
soil. We have reason to believe that this will, in fact, 
happen. Despite Russia's failure thus far to hand over a 
timetable for the withdrawal of the remaining 2,700 troops, the 
withdrawal, albeit reluctantly, is continuing, slowly but 
surely, and people all over Estonia are marking the days 
remaining on their calendars. I do hope that despite the 
unreasonable and irrational stance adopted by the Russian 
delegation at the present round of negotiations Russia will 
abide by its international commitment to withdraw its troops. 
When that happy day arrives, we believe our security will be 
greatly enhanced. 
  However, even after the last active service soldier and 
officer has left, we will still have plenty of reason to be 
vigilant. One primary reason is the presence in Estonia of some 
10,000 retired and reserve former Soviet officers who were 
demobilized before August 20, 1991. This number is roughly five 
times the size of our own fledgling defense forces, and these 
persons tend to be generally young and vital men, as they did 
not retire because they were too old but because they were 
demobilized with perhaps a prospect of future active duty. We 
have 50, 40, and even 35 year-old military "pensioners" in 
Estonia. Some of them served in special units and were trained 
to "take care" of Swedish leaders should a war break out. 
  Because we are not assured of their loyalty to Estonia their 
presence represents a substantial domestic security concern. 
For this reason, my government has taken a humane but firm 
stand on the issue. We have made substantial concessions by 
allowing all those demobilized before the reinstatement of 
independence in 1991 to apply for residence permits. A special 
interministerial commission will consider these applications on 
a case-by-case basis. Needless to say, those who were 
demobilized after August 1991 will not be permitted to apply for 
residence permits -- otherwise every single uniformed Russian 
officer in Estonia could take off his uniform and "retire" -- 
without leaving the country. Germany, for instance, would 
hardly tolerate the continued presence in its eastern part of 
"retired" former Soviet soldiers. 
  One other worry as far as domestic security is concerned is 
our border with Russia. The arguments over whether the 1920 
Tartu Peace Treaty remains in force are well known. Russia 
continues to control territory that, by the terms of that 
treaty, actually belong to Estonia. Any suggestion by Russia 
that Estonia is the one claiming territory is patently false and 
demonstrates a weak understanding both of history and of 
international law. I will speak later of our hopes for 
international mediation in this question. In the meantime, 
however, the Russian Federation has in recent weeks unilaterally 
begun demarcating the administrative control line that runs 
between Russia and Estonia, putting up barbed wire fences and 
stationing sentinels at the line -- when nobody really quite 
knows where this line runs. This we cannot accept. It 
represents a unilateral action that is in direct violation of 
the obligations undertaken by CSCE member states that allow for 
border changes only as a result of bilaterally negotiated 
solutions. We are asking Russia for an explanation of this 
action within the CSCE context. 
  But I wish to speak of purely practical border matters as 
well. The line running between Estonia and Russia continues to 
be altogether too porous, allowing the illegal transfer into 
Estonia, among other goods, of drugs, radioactive metals and 
weapons, not to mention refugees. These contraband goods and 
refugees are generally destined for further transport to points 
West. We are grateful to Sweden for having already helped us 
beef up our border regime, but clearly much more needs to be 
done. We especially need to improve coordination between the 
agencies in Estonia and Sweden that deal with these problems. 
Because as we all know, supply stems from demand and we have to 
tackle the demand end as well. 
  I turn now to my second point, that is developments in 
Russia, and how this affects our security. 
  During the last two months, the campaign of accusations and 
outright threats from Russia has spiralled dramatically. To 
name just a few, let us remember Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's New Year's greeting to his people, in which he said 
that in the new year, Russia would begin paying special 
attention to compatriots living abroad. Then came Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev's address to CIS ambassadors in Moscow, 
implying that the Baltic states were part of the "Near Abroad", 
followed by several bellicose statements by Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev about how Russia would not withdraw its troops. 
  On Monday [28 February] evening, on the eve of our current 
round of talks with Russia, with the Russian delegation already 
in Tallinn and our own negotiating team driving through the 
snowy countryside to where the talks would be held, the latest 
attempt at intimidation was filed with press agencies. This was 
a Russian Foreign Ministry official's statement that Russia 
would not keep to the final withdrawal date already agreed upon. 
The exact wording of this statement was telling. It said, and 
I quote, that "the allegations that Russia has pledged to 
withdraw its troops from Estonia before August 31st this year 
are unfounded" (end of quote). As you can imagine, this latest 
statement did not help start the current round of talks on a 
constructive note, not to mention that it represents yet another 
setback in the withdrawal process. Neither does the continued 
refusal of Russian officials to acknowledge Estonia's occupation 
in 1940 help to create an atmosphere of trust between our 
countries and peoples. 
  A new Russian Foreign Ministry draft program introduced 
early 
last month by Russian Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Mikhail 
Demurin may explain some of these actions. This detailed draft 
program appears to be a comprehensive plan to reinforce Russia's 
stated primary foreign policy goal of protecting the interests 
of ethnic Russians abroad. To this end, the draft program 
foresees the use of various political, economic and 
sociocultural means, including import benefits and banking 
assistance for businesses outside Russia that are run or 
dominated by ethnic Russians, and the establishment of a 
powerful broadcasting network to spread Moscow's word. In 
introducing the program, Demurin told reporters that the plan 
was devised because, and I quote, "diplomatic measures are not 
enough" (end of quote). 
  It seems to us that the draft program has been compiled in 
a hurry by a number of state agencies and ministries with very 
differing mandates, because the draft is uneven and, at times, 
even internally contradictory in its approach. For instance, we 
all understand that any state has the right and duty to protect 
the interests of its citizens living abroad, but the Russian 
Foreign Ministry draft speaks of protecting its ethnic 
compatriots, not citizens. This policy of differentiating 
people by ethnicity is a stance which Estonia does not accept as 
civilized behaviour, but which, paradoxically, is a position 
that Russian officials often accuse Estonia of assuming. 
  This represents a danger to Estonia, it represents a danger 
to Sweden and it represents a danger to Europe. The Baltic Sea 
region has attained a far greater significance than it had for 
the past 70 years or indeed since the Hanseatic period. We are 
again a major trading area, a vital part of a new Europe. 
Russia is again an open market, trade is again flowing through 
the Baltic states to Russia and from Russia to the world. 
Transit to this great market is of vital importance to us and 
Estonia as a trading nation wants to do everything in its power 
to improve on all our economic prospects. The Baltic Sea has the 
potential of regaining its role as a major free trade area that 
it occupied during the Hansa. 
  The Council of Baltic Sea States was called into being to 
respond to a new need for cooperation in our area and I can tell 
you that it has proven a great success. Only last week did our 
region's transport ministers meet in Kaliningrad, with the 
participation of that vital -- overmilitarized -- region's 
officials, to discuss the improvement of transport networks in 
the Baltic Sea area. 
  But this new activity again changes our security 
environment. 
For trade can only prosper in an atmosphere of mutual trust, of 
mutual respect. We have to reconcile all our conflicting 
interests to together become an essential, an integral part of 
the prosperous European family. For this to happen, however, 
all European countries have to accept European rules. And that 
includes Russia. 
  When the Council of Europe was founded following the Second 
World War its founders had a vision of a Europe where everyone, 
great and small, was equal, for only so could a safe future be 
guaranteed for our continent. We cannot allow for these 
principles to be discarded now. No country can assume that it 
has the right to bully others, to force others to do its 
bidding. President Yeltsin's recent speech in the Russian 
Parliament is worrying because it does not accept these 
principles. To quote Yuriy Afanasyev again: "Military pressure 
has forced Yeltsin to reverse himself on acquiescing to Central 
and Eastern European countries seeking NATO membership. The new 
military doctrine of asserting interests in the `near abroad' is 
fuelling more blatant attempts to subordinate former Soviet 
republics...Under the guise of protecting Russian-speaking 
peoples, Russia is supporting 'national liberation' movements in 
countries that seek independence. Sometimes the direct 
participation of Russian troops is camouflaged and presented to 
the world as a peacekeeping mission in an interethnic conflict." 
  If we are to allow that kind of behaviour, we will denounce 
the actions of those that founded the Council of Europe. If we 
are to allow Russian-style peacekeeping missions we will surely 
doom many nations and we will jeopardize the great future which 
our united Europe and our united Baltic Sea region could look 
towards. 
  A united Europe, a democratic Europe, ladies and gentlemen, 
cannot allow any compromises to be made -- be they in the 
requirements for accession to the Council of Europe or in the 
description of peace-keeping missions with which Sweden has had 
ample experience. Democracy is democracy is democracy, and no 
compromises can be made. 
  However, while we wait and hope for Russian leaders to 
accept 
the rules of the Council of Europe we cannot sit idle. In 
difficult times friends and partners are needed and I would like 
to mention the strong support we have received in bilateral 
relations with our closest neighbours in the confused period 
following Russia's parliamentary elections. Sweden has taken 
the lead in trying to exert a moderating influence on Russia, at 
the same time reassuring us that we will not be left alone. 
This present situation reaffirms the necessity of nation-states 
and regional leaders acting and adopting responsibilities when 
global and European structures fail to do so. The Swedish 
leadership has found the courage to be an active and leading 
player in the "Baltic game" when multinational organizations 
have not been brave or focused enough to do so. 
  This continued support has not been only bilateral in 
nature, however. Our neighbours have also pushed hard to 
accelerate our integration into those Western structures that 
may -- provided there is the will -- help to counterbalance the 
crisis in the East. As you know, we have been strong advocates 
of establishing regional security tables within the CSCE 
framework, and would like to inject an element of security 
policy into the activities of the Council of Baltic Sea States. 
  Further afield, we have signed the Partnership for Peace 
[PfP] framework document and regard this as a first step toward 
eventual NATO membership. We are especially interested in 
advancing the cause of true peacekeeping activities within the 
PfP context, and to that end are in the process of establishing 
a joint peacekeeping battalion with our Baltic neighbours. I 
would take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to 
Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and the United Kingdom for 
offering to help train this fledgling battalion while expressing 
the hope that Sweden and Finland will also join the PfP to 
strengthen the "Nordic axis" and to move towards an all-European 
security system. 
  Another expression of our growing integration with Europe 
are 
our ongoing free-trade negotiations with the European Union. We 
hope to have a free-trade agreement eliminating all trade 
barriers and tariffs in force on January 1, 1995. And I am very 
happy to note that the European Council sees us as Associate 
Members of the Union in the near future. In this connection I 
would mention that we strongly support and welcome Sweden's 
membership in the EU. Not only will membership bolster the 
Swedish economy, but it will further strengthen Stockholm's 
already strong role in the international arena. We hope to join 
Sweden as a full member of the European Union at the end of this 
century. 
  However, when earlier speaking about the problems 
international structures face I had one particular process in 
mind -- the European Stability Pact. While the idea conceived 
by French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has great merit, in 
the framework of the European Union it has become stagnant. The 
deliberations around the pact prove that there is not yet very 
much force behind the Common Foreign Policy of the Union and I 
am quite frankly concerned about the effect a failure or 
non-success of the Pact will have on the image of a strong and 
united Europe. 
  Nonetheless, we are determined to do our utmost to help make 
this undertaking a success, because through this Pact, we hope 
both to resolve open questions regarding our border with the 
Russian Federation as well as to give our efforts to integrate 
aliens into Estonian society a much needed shot in the arm. I 
do hope, however, that the European Union will accept the nine 
Central and Eastern European States as true, equal, partners in 
this undertaking, for only so can we -- together -- achieve 
success. 
  I would wrap up this final point by stating the obvious. 
Much has changed in the international security environment 
since my prime minister spoke at this forum one year and 11 days 
ago, but some things remain the same. Last year, Prime Minister 
Mart Laar told you, and I quote, that "It is imperative to 
realize that Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania cannot be abandoned, 
not only for their own sake, but for the precedent that 
deserting our countries would set. We are willing to help in the 
struggle for democracy; we hope that you will be willing to help 
us too" (end of quote). 
  Ladies and Gentlemen: I would conclude my remarks today with 
a maxim set down in the first century B.C. by Greek philosopher 
Publius Syrus, who said (and I quote) that "anyone can hold the 
helm when the sea is calm" (end of quote). My friends, the 
Baltic Sea is a relatively shallow body of water, and this 
shallowness can lend a deceptive sense of safety. As any sailor 
knows, however, storms have a greater effect in shallow than in 
deep waters. We live in politically tempestuous times; the sea 
is not yet calm. But I remain convinced that with continued and 
increased cooperation, with a little diplomatic skill and a 
touch of luck, we can together hold the helm even in troubled 
waters and safely reach shore. 
  Thank you.

<F P=106> [Article by Merike Jurjo and Karin Roossaar: "The Case of </F>
the Missing KGB Files"] 
  [Text] Whatever happened to the prolific files kept by the 
Estonian KGB during fifty years of Soviet rule? That's what 
Estonian political parties archive chief Valdur Ohmann would 
like to know. Ohmann says the Estonian parties' archive houses 
close to 60,000 of the remaining records: less than a quarter 
of the estimated total, he says. 
  The files in the archive attest to Stalinist repressions: 
the mass deportations of Estonian citizens in 1941 and 1949, 
the persecution of clergy, and charges against people involved 
in Estonia's pre-Soviet government. More recent files consist 
primarily of criminal records and "tourism" records, which trace 
every person who traveled abroad. 
  Administrative records, including correspondance, accounts, 
and personnel files are missing, Ohmann says. 
  The KGB files' disappearance may be traced back to the 
dramatic events of August 1991, when the Estonian Kodukaitse 
(home guard), took control of the KGB building at Pagari Street 
in Tallinn. Hardo Aasmae, Tallinn's major at the time, 
personally sealed the door to the KGB archives. Witnesses 
remember seeing clouds of smoke over the KGB building and heard 
rumors that trucks loaded with documents were pulling out from 
behind the building. 
  Soon after, the government rebuffed the archive department's 
attempt to join a commission created to take over the KGB 
documents. 
  In October 1991, the archive building was opened and the 
records handed over to the police department, essentially to the 
body that cooperated with the KGB. 
  By giving the KGB files to the police, "former Estonian 
Prime 
Minister Edgar Savisaar's government violated its own rules," 
says Peep Pillak, state archive department director. A law 
passed August 16, 1990 states that the archives of all 
liquidated organizations must be transferred to the archive 
department. 
  "Or was the police department considered the legal successor 
to the KGB?" Pillak asks. 
  A year-and-a-half passed before Prime Minister Mart Laar 
ordered the police department on April 19, 1993 to transfer 
immediately the KGB records to the archive department. The 
records now occupy the archive for Estonian Political Parties, 
formerly the Estonian Communist Party archives. 
  The so-called Savisaar-Bakatin agreement, made at the end of 
1991, promised the return to Estonia of all KGB records that had 
been carried to Russia. On December 4, 1991, 500 kilos of the 
estimated 5 tons of records were returned, Estonian news agency 
ETA reported. 
  The KGB also housed records in other Estonian towns, but the 
archive department has not received them, Pillak comments. 
  Pillak suspects that part of the KGB archives were destroyed 
or hidden during the year-and-a-half before Laar ordered the 
records to go to the archive department. The rest may still be 
in Russia, he says.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 9 Mar -- "We must draw up a document on 
civic accord between various movements, parliamentary groups, 
and branches of power." This was said by Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin, who was speaking to journalists after a 
wreathe-laying ceremony at Yuriy Gagarin's tomb by the Kremlin 
Wall. 
  In Boris Yeltsin's words, the idea of concluding a civic 
accord memorandum has been backed by the State Duma, the 
Federation Council, the government, and by many parliamentary 
groups. 
  Boris Yeltsin said: "At 1000 hours tomorrow, I summon heads 
of organizations to agree on the drafting of the text itself." 
  Boris Yeltsin noted the need for "all the strata of our 
society to take part" in drawing up the memorandum, "so that it 
really is a civic accord." "And after that, we are going to sign 
it," the president said.

<F P=106> [Interview with presidential aide Georgiy Satarov by Vasiliy </F>
Kononenko; place, date not given: "Power Ministry Structures 
Will Keep Tabs on Those Released From Lefortovo and Their 
Supporters"] 
  [Text] The news that the presidential apparatus and the 
State Duma apparatus are preparing a draft supplement to the 
amnesty decree which has caused so much uproar has been 
interpreted by the public as a belated attempt to create a 
semblance of peace between the executive and legislative 
branches. Meanwhile your IZVESTIYA correspondent has been able 
to elucidate that a compromise regarding future cooperation 
between the branches of power has nevertheless been reached at 
recent meetings with the leaders of the two Federal Assembly 
chambers, I. Rybkin and V. Shumeyko. Consequently two groups 
comprising deputies and experts from the presidential apparatus 
are currently working on a draft new State Duma decree. 
Presidential aide G. Satarov described the significance of the 
forthcoming document (there may actually be two) and the 
objectives of the work. 
  [Kononenko] Georgiy Aleksandrovich, whose initiative was it 
to adopt yet another decree in pursuit of the end which enabled 
the organizers of the revolt to leave Lefortovo? 
  [Satarov] The president's, of course. He mentioned this in 
his letter to the State Duma dated 26 February, i.e. the letter 
he sent on that sad Saturday. In that letter the president 
expressed his regret at the form in which the amnesty decree had 
been adopted, and also set out two proposals. The first 
suggested additional work on the amnesty decree with a view to 
making it conform fully with the Russian Federation Constitution 
and legislation. The second proposed adopting a memorandum on a 
system of forms, criteria, and a mechanism designed to make 
politicians liable for ensuring civil peace and harmony. At the 
present time the outline of a joint memorandum envisaging the 
liability of individual parties and all branches of power for 
their actions and the situation in the country is being sketched 
out. 
  [Kononenko] Did the president's 28 February meeting with the 
parliamentary chamber leaders provide the impetus for this 
cooperation? 
  [Satarov] You could say that, since the preliminary 
agreements were finally coordinated at these meetings. First of 
all it was decided to set up working groups comprising 
representatives of the president, the lower chamber, and the 
Prosecutor's Office to formulate a supplementary State Duma 
decree. Second, agreement was reached on future working 
arrangements with the aim of insuring against a repetition of 
similar explosive situations; specifically, such situations 
should be discussed beforehand at the level of working groups 
when formulating extremely important decisions and draft laws. 
Third, they agreed on the need to minimize the damage to the 
sociopolitical situation caused by the amnesty decree. 
  [Kononenko] By what means? 
  [Satarov] Political and juridical. It was decided to 
explain to those who have benefited from the amnesty that they 
should not view the State Duma decree as some sort of political 
victory and that their earlier forms of activity are currently 
not needed by society. At I. Rybkin's suggestion, this task 
should be carried out by the factions of the lower chamber. 
Moreover, the General Prosecutor's Office is obliged to warn 
those who have benefited from the amnesty that they could be 
penalized if they break the amnesty terms. Finally, they should 
be notified that the appropriate services will be carefully 
following their every move. In the event of the slightest 
infringement of the law, both the president and the State Duma 
intend to clamp down on them in an extremely resolute fashion. 
We will not allow anything to get out of hand, and we will not 
tolerate any lawlessness that could lead to an explosive 
situation. 
  [Kononenko] So are tabs currently being kept on the 
released prisoners? 
  [Satarov] We have been watching them ever since they left 
jail. 
  [Kononenko] During consultations over the last few days you 
have met with rank-and-file deputies and senior office-holders 
in the State Duma. Do you not get the feeling that those who 
voted for the amnesty are now rethinking certain points? 
  [Satarov] One can note a certain alarm, a realization of the 
fact that they have made themselves hostages to the released 
prisoners' behavior. 
  [Kononenko] At a 28 February briefing you announced that the 
president has a short-term action plan. A television address 
has not been ruled out. But for the time being he has taken no 
steps. 
  [Satarov] We are talking about planned rather than 
extraordinary actions. For example, a list of priority 
legislative initiatives has already been sent to parliament 
along with a timetable for their submission. A plan of measures 
designed to resolve urgent social and economic problems has also 
been prepared, and so forth. 
  [Kononenko] Ye. Gaydar has called on democrats to rally 
round in the face of the threat to civil peace in Russia. Do 
you share his view? 
  [Satarov] Absolutely. The fact is that the establishment of 
a democratic state is far from completed, and in the current 
situation revanchists will always be tempted to exploit this 
fact. We need to consolidate the state -- as the president said 
in his message -- and ensure a democratic basis for the reforms.

<F P=106> [Interview with St Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak by </F>
Caroline Mascher; place and date not given: "Deliberate 
Exaggeration"] 
  [Text] [Mascher] Mr. Sobchak, is the amnesty for the 
putschists endangering Russia's stability? 
  [Sobchak] These men brought themselves so much into 
discredit, at the latest with the putsch, that they will no 
longer play a serious role in politics. If they are really 
innocent, as they are claiming, they could have had that 
confirmed before court. Amnesty can only be granted to people 
who are guilty. 
  [Mascher] It is said that Rutskoy might be built up as an 
identification figure for the humiliated masses.... 
  [Sobchak] You know, I know Rutskoy personally. He is an 
extremely narrow-minded man with great ambition, but little 
intelligence. He is not a statesman, but always remains on the 
level of a division commander. All the time, he only executes 
orders. 
  [Mascher] In his speech before the Duma, President Yeltsin 
made great concessions to the opposition and forces hostile to 
reforms.... 
  [Sobchak] Yes, that is true. But there is also a new 
opposition. The previous one openly called for Yeltsin's 
removal. Therefore, he behaved differently toward it, but he was 
still not tough enough. In his place, I would have dissolved 
the parliament as early as April after the successful 
referendum. However, Yeltsin is unfortunately unable to use the 
results of his victories. This was also the case in August 
1991. Today we have a completely different situation. The 
opposition is no longer intransigent, people like Gaydar or 
Yavlinskiy are also in the opposition. Therefore, Yeltsin is 
behaving differently. 
  [Mascher] But the amnesty was a provocation.... 
  [Sobchak] Yes, of course, the Duma challenged the president. 
However, I believe that an aggressive confrontation between the 
president and the parliament no longer makes any sense today 
because the new constitution is already effective. 
  [Mascher] That is to say, one is not afraid of politicians 
like Zhirinovskiy? 
  [Sobchak] His importance is above all exaggerated in the 
West. He has hardly any influence in the Duma, whereas people 
such as the communist Zyuganov, Lapshin from the Peasant Party, 
or Gaydar are influential. 
  I think that the West is not reacting like this by chance. 
It wants to justify its inactivity -- the lack of real help and 
cooperation. So far, Russia has received the promised loans 
neither from the United States nor from the European Union, only 
the time allowed for the repayment of debts has been extended 
and tied loans for buying grain from the Americans have been 
granted. That is to say, Washington is supporting its own 
farmers, but not Russia. Then we have to repay these funds at a 
high interest. 
  The West is not only interested in Zhirinovsky because of 
his 
scandalous appearances. It is not openly said, but some 
politicians take the view that the weaker Russia is, the better 
it is for the West, as it would no longer be a threat. This is 
an incorrect assessment that could dangerously disturb the 
balance of forces.

  [Text] Chechnya President Dzhokhar Dudayev said that the 
Russian State Duma's amnesty was "an illegitimate child." In an 
exclusive interview he told Interfax that by using its 
constitutional right to declare an amnesty the Duma "hit Russian 
society where it hurts. This will obviously stir up 
confrontation processes in Russia." 
  In his words, "without legally evaluating the activities of 
state criminals who were guilty of organizing the shelling of 
the former Supreme Soviet, the Duma members and some senior 
officials wanted to be rehabilitated in order to escape 
responsibility. This action makes more confrontation and 
destabilization possible with a view to removing the leading 
political figures, Rutskoy, Khasbulatov and Makashov, with 
simultaneous threat of retribution if these men stage a 
comeback." 
  He forecast that "the next step will be an all-out assault 
on 
the Presidency. When nearly everybody tries to unseat him, the 
Russian president will find it hard to stay in power. The 
scenario of these activities includes neutralizing Premier 
Viktor Chernomyrdin to be followed by discrediting and removing 
him from the political scene." 
  The Chechen leader appreciated the stance of former 
prosecutor general Aleksey Kazannik as that of a "courageous and 
honest man who cannot trifle with the law even once."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "One More Step Toward Unity"] </F>
  [Text] A meeting of the Political Executive Committee of 
the Union of Communist Parties-CPSU [UCP-CPSU] Council and the 
Secretariat of the Russian Communist Workers Party [RCWP] 
Central Committee has taken place. Questions of joint actions 
to implement the decisions of the 29th CPSU Congress and the 
Third RCWP Congress were examined at it. The discussion 
confirmed the unity of views of the UCP-CPSU and the RCWP on the 
following basic issues: 
  -- the transfer of political power into the hands of the 
workers and the restoration of the soviets as the highest form 
of democracy; 
  -- the struggle against the restoration of capitalism, and 
the country's return to the socialist path of development; 
  -- the repeal of the Belovezhskaya Forest agreements and 
the restoration of the Union of Soviet Socialists Republics. 
  The UCP-CPSU and the RCWP regard the ruling regime in Russia 
and the imposed Constitution as antipeople elements and will 
jointly endeavor to have the Constitution's adoption judged 
unlawful at the Russian Federation Supreme Court. 
  In response to the propaganda hysteria surrounding the 
political amnesty, participants in the meeting stated that they 
categorically reject violence as a means of resolving social 
problems. The UCP-CPSU and the RCWP consider that national 
accord and the establishment of capitalism by force are 
incompatible. It is not the political amnesty which is 
provoking a civil war but unemployment, hunger, the plunder of 
the people's property, the poverty of millions of working 
people, and the monstrous enrichment of a few people. 
  The RCWP's admission to the UCP-CPSU as an associate member 
is regarded as a step toward rallying the Soviet Union's 
communists. It was noted that the unification of communists is 
being hindered by the opportunist tendencies remaining within 
it. It was emphasized that it is essential to concentrate 
efforts on creating in the future a single Communist Party of 
Russia based on Marxist-Leninist principles. Such a party could 
take as its basis the current programs of the UCP-CPSU, the 
RCWP, and other parties. 
  The path to the organizational unification of the communist 
parties existing today lies in extending unity of action in the 
struggle to defend the working people's interests. The UCP-CPSU 
and the RCWP will use in this struggle all means and methods 
(both parliamentary and extraparliamentary) known from the 
practice of the world communist movement, and will consider the 
development of an organized workers resistance [organizovannoye 
rabocheye soprotivleniye] as a task of the utmost importance.

  [Text] Moscow March 8 TASS -- Russian communist hardliner 
Viktor Anpilov has called on all communist movements of Russia 
to unite into one strong party on the basis of principles of 
Marxism-Leninism. 
  Anpilov, leader of the Labour Russia Party and the Russian 
Communist Labour Party who was put in jail after the October 
1993 revolt in Moscow and released under amnesty in February,

Marx and Vladimir Lenin. 
  Anpilov took part in a rally devoted to International 
Women's 
Day traditionally celebrated in Russia on March 8. The rally 
was attended by about 1,000 people, according to the police.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Karkhanin: "In Search of Justice. How </F>
Are the Amendments to the Law on Russian Citizenship 
Functioning?"] 
  [Text] It is around seven months since this law was 
amended and amplified, so some conclusions can now be drawn. It 
was the topic of a seminar organized in Moscow by the leadership 
of the Russian Federation Presidential Commission on Citizenship 
Affairs. Representatives of regional administrations and 
internal affairs organs participated in the discussion. 
  "The amendments are not functioning effectively everywhere, 
in some places the local authorities prefer to operate in the 
old way," Commission Chairman Abdulakh Mikitayev told your 
ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent. "Yet there has been a marked 
reduction in the flow of complaints and appeals to the president 
in connection with citizenship problems. So more often than not 
people are able to find help locally on the basis of the law: 
in Russian consulates abroad and through the internal affairs 
organs in Russia. Complaints from `first'- and `second'-wave 
emigres in the more remote foreign countries have virtually 
dried up: People there are now entitled to obtain Russian 
citizenship by registration, while remaining citizens of the 
country where they currently live." 
  Russian-speaking inhabitants of the Baltic countries are 
particularly active in taking advantage of this opportunity. So 
far 40,000 people in Estonia and 20,000 in Latvia have obtained 
the relevant stamp or insert in their passports. There are many 
waiting in the wings in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, but 
the situation is complicated by the fact that the network of 
Russian consulates is not yet sufficiently developed, and not 
everyone can afford to travel to the republic capital. The 
number of consulates must be significantly increased, Abdulakh 
Mikitayev believes, in the interests of present and future 
Russian citizens living in the neighboring foreign countries. 
  It is a fundamentally important fact that citizenship and 
registration are different things, although in order to become a 
Russian citizen a person is obliged to confirm where he lives 
via the internal affairs organs. This procedure has not yet 
been perfected in practice. Another problem is citizenship for 
members of officers' families and students who have come to 
study in higher educational establishments in the Russian 
Federation. The Commission is prepared to do something for the 
students, since many of them intend to work in Russia on 
obtaining their diplomas, and many of tomorrow's specialists 
consider that their future lies there. 
  The situation in Estonia and Latvia remains particularly 
worrying. Why? The answer is simple: There is legislative 
discrimination there against Russian-speakers, contary to 
agreements with Russia and their own constitutions. In these 
republics thousands of people have been left outside the civil 
space and are now called "illegal migrants" or "occupiers." 
  Abdulakh Mikitayev said that in conversation with the 
Estonian leaders he had tried to explain to them that Russian 
people as well as the indigenous inhabitants had constructed 
plants in the republic and had borne the hardships. Driving 
these people to desperation would mean provoking a social 
explosion, which many in Russia itself would certainly not 
regard with indifference... There are few mono-ethnic states in 
the world. Why should Estonia be one? But for some unknown 
reason the republic's leaders believe that Russian-speaking 
inhabitants are a potential threat to the formation of national 
statehood. 
  The multitude of worrying facts studied by the Commission 
on Citizenship Affairs formed the basis of a memorandum that 
Abdulakh Mikitayev sent to Boris Yeltsin in August: A state 
program is needed to support ethnic Russians in the neighboring 
foreign countries. The government has already prepared on the 
president's behalf a draft program touching on economic, 
political, and legal questions, and it is being finalized by the 
ministries. 
  "We will try to ensure that the neighboring republics 
observe 
both human rights and ethnic minorities' rights and interstate 
agreements," Abdulakh Mikitayev continued. "Let there be more 
vigorous action from the United Nations and other international 
organizations. At the moment their methods often smack of the 
old double standards: peremptorily demanding the withdrawal of 
Russian forces from other republics, but failing to notice how 
the authorities are treating Russian people. Actually, UN 
Commissioner for Ethnic Minorities Van der Stoel, who has made 
repeated visits to the Baltic countries, has noted that the 
legislation adopted there does not conform to international 
standards." 
  Two further conclusions could be drawn based on the 
experience of recent years, according to Abdulakh Mikitayev. 
The first is that a powerful coordinating organ is needed to 
support ethnic Russians in neighboring foreign countries. It 
could be the Foreign Ministry, a government section, or, as 
Andrey Kozyrev suggested, a separate new federal service. The 
second conclusion is that sooner or later there is clearly going 
to be a single citizenship again in the Commonwealth countries, 
on the model of the European states. But at the moment the 
protection of the rights of Russians in neighboring foreign 
countries can only be fully ensured if these people create 
autonomous entities where they live in numbers. "Aside from 
anything else, this is the only way to preserve Russian ethnic 
culture outside Russia. Anything else is a half-measure," 
Abdulakh Mikitayev said, bringing the conversation with your 
ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent to an end.

  [Text] The Moscow Prosecutor's Office has finished the 
study of materials it received late in August and early in 
September 1993 from the Russian Security Council's 
Interdepartmental Commission for Combatting Crime and Corruption 
(ICCCC), a Prosecutor's Office source told Interfax. 
  Prosecutor's Office investigator Mikhail Slinko said the 
investigation work done by the ICCCC last year lay outside the 
commission's authority. 
  The prosecution started on September 3, 1993, against 
officials from the Agrokhim Association (today called the 
Russian Agrochemical Company) suspected of unauthorized transfer 
of funds abroad, was quashed on February 22. But eight of the 
19 volumes of Agrokhim case documents which concern the 
operations of the Vozrozhdeniye financial and trading company 
distributing baby food bought in Israel have been sent over to 
the Prosecutor General's Office, the Moscow Prosecutor's Office 
being unable to trace the whereabouts of a shipment of baby food 
worth $1.5 Mn. 
  On January 17, the Moscow Prosecutor's office terminated the 
prosecution against former vice president Aleksandr Rutskoy, 
whom the ICCCC suspected of illegal dealings with the Trade 
Links Ltd. company. In this connection, the office the same day 
started a libel case against "an unidentified person," in which 
Acting Prosecutor General Aleksey Ilyushenko is a witness.

  [Text] Boris Yeltsin reaffirmed today that Ostankino and 
the Russian channel television [RTV] should be state-owned. He 
said this to journalists at the end of his meeting today with 
the heads of both television companies, which he described as 
difficult but interesting. 
  The president had a brief meeting with journalists following 
the ceremony of laying wreaths at Yuriy Gagarin's grave. 
Replying to an ITAR-TASS correspondent's question, Yeltsin 
reaffirmed his position set out in the president's annual 
message to the Federal Assembly to the effect that the first and 
second programs should be state-owned. Otherwise, Yeltsin 
believes, we may lose it, it may be broken up by various parties 
and currents. 
  The Russian president said that he had today received from 
Aleksandr Yakovlev a milder draft of the edict and an 
aide-memoire on this question. Oleg Poptsov also presented him 
with an aide-memoire. In Yeltsin's opinion, the head of Russian 
Television is of the opinion that the Russian channel should be 
state-owned. Yeltsin noted that it was not just a question of 
the problems of television, but of the development of political 
processes in the country.

<F P=106> [Anri Vartanov report: "Harking Back to the Week on </F>
Television: Walking a Knife Edge"] 
  [Text] Let me tell you that our television presenters are 
very fond, to put it more politely as it were, of "plagiarizing" 
their foreign colleagues' achievements. The most popular 
television game shows, starting with the well-known "Field of 
Miracles," are precise copies of their U.S. or European 
originals. The serials "Trifles of Life" or "Goryachev and the 
Others" are pale imitations of their "soap operas." 
  Last Saturday the prominent Ostankino Television Company's 
main news program joined the ranks of the "copycats." Now 
"Novosti-Plus" will appear once a week instead of "Novosti." 
Just like in Paris on their Channel Five. The presenter of the 
first broadcast did not explain the advantages of this 
innovation very intelligibly. It seems that common-or-garden 
news will be supplemented by analysis and summaries. 
  A few hours before the program aired there was another 
airing 
-- this time for the amnestied inmates of Lefortovo. The 
program had a splendid opportunity to demonstrate its new 
principles. But nothing of the sort: Ostankino's journalists 
did not dare analyze the incident straightaway. They were 
afraid. 
  You may retort: I thought the times had gone when television 
operated on instructions from on high. Now if it is dependent 
on anyone it is only on our tastes and requirements as viewers. 
But no. On the Wednesday that the Duma voted in favor of the 
amnesty -- it was Fatherland Defenders' Day -- the Russian 
Television [RTV] schedule included P. Todorovskiy's excellent 
film "Encore, Encore Again." At the scheduled time, when 
millions of viewers were settling down in front of their 
television sets, a toothy presenter appeared on the screen 
instead of the well-known movie and made a short speech. From 
which it emerged that RTV had received a host of telephone calls 
protesting the showing of the movie. 
  The next day some newspapers revealed the secret identity of 
the anonymous defenders of public morality and Soviet officers' 
dignity who had telephoned RTV. They were the defense minister 
and the chairman of the War Veterans' Committee. I vividly 
remembered a similar thing happening three years ago involving 
former [Defense] Minister D. Yazov. When he was told that 
producer Peter Stein intended to stage the "Oresteia" by the 
ancient Greek dramatist Aeschylus in the Soviet Army Theater, he 
said that he would not allow a German to stage a Greek there. 
This rapidly flew around the capital's intelligentsia and the 
marshal lost all their respect even before the August putsch. 
  However, there was at least some logic to that decision: The 
Army Theater is subsidized by the Defense Ministry. But what 
about in this case? The government allocates money for 
television, only half of what is required, moreover. So there 
was no reason but overbearing arrogance for the telephone calls 
to the television station. And the leaders of RTV who postponed 
the movie until another day demonstrated the basic principle of 
playing it safe. 
  The events of the last week on television enable us to view 
the problem of television's destatization from a new angle. A 
few days ago there were rumors going round yet again that an 
edict on the flotation of "Ostankino" is supposedly on the 
president's desk awaiting signature. During the "Without 
Touching Up" program on Monday during which journalists met with 
V. Shumeyko, he was asked -- as recent minister of the press and 
someone who advocated the flotation of television before other 
leaders -- to speak about this. His answer was extremely 
indicative. 
  The speaker of the upper chamber of parliament thinks that 
one of the two main television channels must remain a state 
channel. But the other must be proclaimed a national channel and 
a prominent industrial and financial association like AvtoVAZ or 
LogoVaz must be allowed to take part in its flotation. I noted 
that he named these firms with their close links with the 
government. 
  The man behind the plan indirectly acknowledged this saying 
that "you have to go to the limit in this, you have to be able 
to walk a knife edge." And although that idea was not 
developed, I saw it as a desire on the part of the authorities 
to keep control over the two major television channels. In 
order to ensure that on Chemical Worker's Day or Teacher's Day 
the relevant minister can call the head of the television 
channel on the "hot line" and demand that a program he finds 
unsuitable be taken off. 
  And the latter will take it off, he will have no other 
option, my dear....

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Pashkov followed by editorial </F>
commentary: "The Ministry of Railways Has Declared War on 
Newspaper Readers. This Is the Purport of a Telegram Received in 
Sverdlovsk Oblast"] 
  [Text] Yekaterinburg -- "In connection with numerous 
instances which have come to light concerning the conveyance of 
commercial freight in mail cars in most flagrant violation of 
the transport regulations, particularly when a highly flammable 
liquid is loaded into cars and the actual weight of the freight 
is understated -- which poses a threat to the life and health of 
passengers and train crews -- the Ministry of Railways orders 
that as of 15 March this year, it is forbidden to couple all 
mail cars to fast trains and passenger trains, except for local 
ones." 
  If you consider that local trains are few and irregular 
today 
(once again on the initiative of the Ministry of Railways), it 
follows from this that thousands of subscribers to IZVESTIYA and 
other publications printed in Yekaterinburg will receive the 
newspaper two or three days later in Perm or Tyumen. But even 
in Sverdlovsk Oblast itself, which covers an area of thousands 
of kilometers, any newspaper will now arrive much later, for 
previously the whole system of newspaper delivery was geared not 
to the convenience of railroad workers but to the speed of 
delivery of the printed word. It is clear that nobody wants a 
"stale" newspaper.... 
  In the opinion of specialists, the reference to concern for 
the health of passengers is clearly of a demagogic nature. 
This, incidentally, can be seen from the telegram itself. 
Everything here is simpler -- if a really commercial car is 
coupled instead of a mail car which is used as a commercial car, 
then the railroad will make a corresponding profit. It is clear 
that if corruption exists in society, for example, then it is 
necessary to combat corruption and not all of society. 
<H5>  From the Editors </H5>
  Together with the report from own correspondent Aleksandr 
Pashkov we also received from Yekaterinburg a copy of the 
Railways Ministry telegram signed by Deputy Minister Salatov. 
It turns out that the ban on coupling mail cars to fast trains 
and passenger trains extends not only to Sverdlovsk Oblast but 
also to the entire area of the former USSR, including the Baltic 
countries! 
  In order to understand what kind of a blow this is to 
readers 
of daily newspapers, let us report that IZVESTIYA, for example, 
is printed in 27 CIS cities, to which newspaper pages are sent 
by phototelegraph, are duplicated in regional printing plants, 
and are then sent on to other cities and villages -- frequently 
precisely by rail transport. If a newspaper is held up for 
two-five days on its way to the subscribers, this renders the 
journalists' work pointless. Reporters sometimes risk their 
lives to be the first to report events; every day, on the eve of 
signing an issue to press, the production group calculates the 
production schedule minute by minute -- all so that the finished 
product, in accordance with the will of the railroad chiefs, can 
be turned into unwanted bundles of waste paper! 
  Alas, this is not the first time in recent years that 
newspapers, particularly daily ones, have fallen victim to the 
petty tyranny of officials. The press is not even mentioned in 
Mr. Salatov's order. But must the press and its millions of 
readers pay for the fact that mail car guards convey "freight 
which does not correspond to the carriage documents, including 
flammable and dangerously explosive freight"? Why are 
newspapers, which already pay the railroads punctually for 
delivering their goods, obliged to pay for the Railways 
Ministry's internal departmental innovations? 
  If such a thing had happened some 10 years ago, the very 
next 
day the minister of railways would have received a severe 
reprimand in the CPSU Central Committee Agitation and Propaganda 
Department. What? -- the "voice of the party" might not be heard 
by the people! Times are different now, and the press "merely" 
helps to realize citizens' constitutional right to timely and 
objective information. But this function of the press seems an 
empty abstraction to the officials of various ranks who are 
accustomed just to severe reprimands and administrative rebukes. 
There is no serious counterweight to departmental tyranny in 
the government either, which is concerned with more "important" 
matters than the timely delivery of newspapers. 
  There must, however, also be the matter of elementary 
respect 
for the millions of our fellow citizens who certainly do not 
live in capitals. What wrong have they done Mr. Salatov? 
  Is there a body in our country which is capable of repealing 
the decision of the deputy minister of railways? If there is, 
when will this happen?

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Roman Zadunaysky] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 9 TASS -- Brutal bullying or 
"conscript-baiting" became the cause of the South Kuril islands 
as a result of which six servicemen were killed and several 
wounded, a source in Russia's law enforcement agencies told 
ITAR-TASS referring to the data of a preliminary questioning of 
the attackers. 
  The same source gave details of the March 8 tragedy when 
Beltsov and Agdashev, young servicemen, entered the dormitory of 
the first border picket of the Pacific Border District 
(Tanfilyev island, South Kurils) at seven in the morning on 
Tuesday and opened fire with automatic weapons on 
fellow-servicemen -- the old rankers. According to a 
preliminary lead during the investigation, they wanted to avenge 
an earlier insult resultant of brutal bullying. 
  The border picket personnel for several hours had been 
unable 
to pacify "mutinous" soldiers who, upon taking an advantageous 
position, beat off by automatic fire all attempts to seize them. 
Then the border picket commander called in a Mi-8 helicopter 
from Kunashir island for help but Beltsov and Agdashev managed 
to shoot down the helicopter which caught fire in midair and 
fell onto the island. According to preliminary data, the crew 
were not hurt while the helicopter burned up. 
  Only at 16.00 on Tuesday, a seizure group managed to 
neutralise and apprehend the culprits of the tragedy. Six 
servicemen were killed and several wounded in the fierce daylong 
gunbattle on Tanfilyev island. Beltsov and Agdashev were seized 
alive. 
  The same source dismissed rumours that Beltsov and Agdashev 
intended to flee to Japan. He said Colonel-General Andrey 
Nikolayev, commander of the Russian Federation border forces, 
the commander of the Pacific Border District and the military 
prosecutor of the district had been unable to get to the 
Tanfilyev island for the second day due to the typhoon-caused 
heavy storm. 
  Criminal proceedings have been instituted on the strength of 
the incident facts, and an investigation is under way.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Yu. N. Rodionov, deputy of </F>
the State Duma, by unidentified correspondent; place and date 
not given; from the "Aty-Baty" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Rodionov] All members of 
the committee understand the aims and tasks of the committee. 
Insofar as the army is above politics and has no factions or 
party groupings within it, the committee likewise must reflect 
the armed forces since in practice it works for the needs of the 
armed forces by drawing up legislation necessary to them. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Do you think there is a need to criticize 
the armed forces, and how should it be done? Do people have the 
right to participate in its reform? Should reform be through 
public control, the press, or the State Duma? 
  [Rodionov] Everyone can be criticized, the armed forces 
included, as long as the criticism is based on fact and not on 
malignant attitudes or personal resentment. The life and 
activities of the armed forces should be widely publicized in 
the press, radio, and television--that is, in all mass media. 
  [Correspondent] Don't you presently receive sufficient 
publicity? 
  [Rodionov] No, it is insufficient. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] What is the relationship with the Defense 
Ministry of those servicemen currently serving as deputies? Has 
their status been determined yet? Will they be discharged from 
the armed forces? What relationship do they have with the 
Defense Ministry? 
  [Rodionov] To reply to the first part of your question, I 
will say all of us servicemen elected as deputies to the State 
Duma of the Federal Assembly are, how can I put it, the flesh 
and blood of our armed forces. For instance, I am in my 39th 
year of service with the armed forces, so how can I speak of 
having some kind of relationship with the Defense Ministry. I 
am part of the armed forces and do not think of myself in any 
other terms. Those servicemen who are State Duma deputies think 
of themselves in exactly the same way. 
  Unfortunately, our present legal status has not been 
defined. 
Article 44 of the Law on Military Responsibility and Military 
Service provides that a soldier's service is suspended for the 
period of his full-time work in an elected body. This article 
was abolished by the presidential edict of 24 December 1993, 
creating a legal vacuum. So now, if a serviceman is to be 
discharged, then which article should apply? The article on 
staff reductions cannot apply, since our jobs have not been 
reduced. The article on bad conduct cannot be applied either, 
since we have not done anything illegal, and so on. There is no 
article in accordance with which we could discharge 
servicemen-deputies. The one remaining article which can be 
applied is the one which permits us to attach these people to a 
government body--which the State Duma is--and leave them on 
active service. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Are you satisfied with the way the situation 
is currently shaping up in the State Duma as regards military 
issues? Does something need to be done or strengthened? Do we 
need to change something before it's too late, or to say 
something to the deputies and officers? 
  [Rodionov] The Duma is the reflection of the situation in 
our country and armed forces. Now is a complicated period for 
the country, as well as for the armed forces and the State Duma. 
The country and the armed forces will survive this period. 
There must be progress. I believe our country will come out of 
the situation in which it finds itself. 
  [Correspondent] Where will this progress come from, and what 
is the basis for it? 
  [Rodionov] It is the lawmaking work of the Duma. There must 
be precise legislation, and precise demands must be made on the 
executive power to implement the legislation adopted by the 
Duma. Until we start implementing the existing legislation, we 
will not make any sense from any of the vital activities 
happening in our country. 
  Independent deputies--those elected from single-mandate 
districts--will form the basis of the center in the Duma. As a 
matter of fact, the idea of consolidating all forces to 
implement the tasks facing the Duma, and on which practically 
all independent deputies are working, has been enunciated within 
the new regional policy party grouping. Namely, it is the 
independent deputies who are not members of any party who must 
undertake and head this work of consolidation, because the main 
task facing the Duma is not the clarification of relationships 
between parties, but the difficult and exacting work of drafting 
laws.

  [Text] According to the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper, the 
Russian Defense Ministry soon intends to carry out a reduction 
in the military mass media -- a reform of military newspapers 
and magazines. This is brought about by the critical state of 
their finances. In all likelihood, publication of 
large-circulation newspapers on vessels, flotillas, and bases 
will cease. Only the fleet and district newspapers, such as the 
Pacific Fleet's newspaper BOYEVAYA VAKHTA [COMBAT WATCH], will 
remain.

  [Text] Moscow March 7 TASS -- Land troops will remain the 
basis of the Russian armed forces well into the future, 
according to Russian land forces commander Colonel-General 
Vladimir Semenov. In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, 
Semenov said that land forces should be slightly trimmed up to 
make them more mobile and manoeuvrable, better governable and 
able to perform any task. He said that presently Russian land 
troops are engaged in various operations in Tajikistan, South 
Ossetia, the Dniester region of Moldova and other trouble spots 
in the former Soviet Union. He stressed that they are also fit 
enough to replace Russian paratroopers in Bosnia. 
  Speaking about the problems facing his troops, Semenov said 
that the major of them is the lack of finances. It takes 10 to 
15 years to develop new types of weapons, but there are no means 
to finance new programmes, most of which remain on paper. He 
regretted that the Manevr management and control system which 
was developed almost 20 years ago has become obsolete but there 
is nothing new to replace it with. 
  Semenov said that the principle of left-over staffing of 
land 
troops which make up almost a half of the Russian army is 
especially alarming. The system of service on a cotract basis 
has proven ineffective. "Until the country gets a strong 
economy, one can hardly hope that skilled volunteers would join 
the army," he said.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Yermolin article: "Benefits Guaranteed to </F>
Servicemen by Law are Not a Subject for Speculation"] 
  [Text] "The Russian Government has no intention of 
abolishing servicemen's benefits," Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin felt compelled to state recently. As far as I 
recall this is not the first time in the past 18 months that 
someone at the very highest level has assured the Army: 
Attempts to economize at the expense of servicemen's social 
protection will be prevented. 
  On this occasion it was the Finance Ministry which had 
proposed scrapping free medical services for reservists and 
retired servicemen, the compulsory insurance of officers' 
property, interest-free loans for military college graduates to 
help them settle in and for officers to build houses and 
cottages, and the one-off grant equivalent to 20 times the 
[monthly] salary for those discharged into the reserve (a figure 
of five times the salary was proposed instead). Prior to this, 
in the days of Boris Fedorov, the finance department was 
hatching a plan to tax servicemen. A month or two earlier, the 
Finance Ministry, in league with the Ministry of Transport and 
the Ministry of Communications, tried to amend the list of 
benefits contained in the Russian Federation Law "On the status 
of servicemen." In other words, instead of making the benefit 
mechanism really effective (and at the moment it is just 
muddling along) the men from the ministries decided to abolish 
it entirely. 
  No matter what you say, some civilian departments still 
suffer from an irresistible urge to "raid" the military for 
funds. That urge is so irresistible that you get the definite 
impression that the Finance Ministry's specialists are pinning 
all their hopes of curbing inflation on the Armed Forces alone. 
Clearly the minds of the financiers refuse to work in any other 
direction. Meanwhile the talk about the taxation of 
superprofits remains to this day mere talk. Of course, the 
functionaries have no intention of economizing at their own 
expense: The state apparatus is burgeoning, as the president 
has already said a number of times. 
  Meanwhile, as usual, the press and television are already 
hinting to the slow-witted where they might find the source of 
all our woes: It is planned to spend ten times more on defense 
than on medicine and education, they say.... In journalists' 
commentaries virtually all the items of budget spending were 
slightly overshadowed by the sum of spending on defense. 
However, if you read the budget carefully it is not difficult 
to see that in comparison with 1993 it has not increased at all. 
But the tasks with which life is constantly confronting the 
Russian Army cost the Defense Ministry a pretty penny. Perhaps 
the subject of the debate itself -- benefits -- will become 
immeasurably small because there will be nothing with which to 
finance the Armed Forces' combat readiness. 
  No one is disputing that costs in the Army can and must be 
cut. For example, they can be cut by introducing new, more 
efficient but less energy-intensive systems of armaments and 
hardware. Doubtless the scientists could make a contribution 
here without this having an adverse effect on the Army's combat 
readiness. By not stinting on the automation and 
computerization of the Armed Forces today we would surely 
achieve a substantial saving tomorrow. The investment of the 
necessary resources in scientific and technical research for the 
needs of defense would, in the very near future, undoubtedly 
result in the reduction of the numerical strength of the Army 
and positive structural changes. Paradoxical as it may seem, 
economizing is a costly exercise. And that is particularly true 
when applied to the defense of the state. 
  For some reason it is constantly suggested that we should 
cut costs in the Army at the expense of the serviceman's family 
budget. Let us leave aside the immorality of the very approach 
of giving benefits with one hand, taking them away with the 
other. Such "reformist" methods will hardly enhance within the 
Army the prestige of contract relations with the state. It is a 
good thing, of course, that this is understood by the top 
officials in the government but it is strange that it is not 
understood by statesmen of ministerial rank. 
  Yes, military men do not sow or reap and it is not 
immediately obvious where the revenue section in the defense 
budget actually is. Nevertheless, there is a revenue section if 
you recall the Russian soldiers' peacemaking missions in 
Tajikistan, Georgia, the North Caucasus, the Dniester region, 
and finally in the former Yugoslavia. Such is the reality: In 
our troubled world the state's ability to protect itself and its 
interests still counts for a lot. The Army is ensuring peace in 
Russia today without firing a shot or engaging in a cheap 
display of muscle flexing and is doing all it can to establish 
peace outside its borders. Surely even the most convinced 
pro-marketeer must recognize that stability in the country, 
without which the normal course of the reforms is inconceivable, 
has been ensured to no small extent by the very existence of 
combat-capable Armed Forces which enjoy prestige in the world. 
Admittedly one feels embarrassed about having to state such 
banal truths. 
  I do not believe that the financiers were pursuing any 
political interests when they put their anti-army initiative to 
the government. But even on their own the rumors unquestionably 
produce a political effect. It is no coincidence that Viktor 
Chernomyrdin let slip a phrase about forces trying to bring the 
Army into conflict with the president and the government. 
  The very fact that such proposals have appeared from the 
Finance Ministry is alarming. They did not succeed today but 
what about tomorrow? Surely people are right when they talk 
about the need for the adoption of a law on criminal liability 
for non-implementation of the articles of the defense budget and 
for any delays in financial operations affecting the combat 
readiness of the troops. The Army's life and well-being must be 
defined by the Law and by the Law alone, least of all by the 
will of individual officials even those of the very highest 
rank. As for the "package of military laws," I should like to 
hope that if ministers or parliamentarians recall them again it 
will only be to improve them and make them more efficient and 
effective and able to operate in full and without exception. In 
that respect there is much work to be done. 
  At the moment, however, when the military man joins his 
detail, takes up combat positions, or goes on alert duty at sea 
he must be confident that when he returns he will not be worse 
off than when he started. Just as the young man contemplating 
the future from the threshold of military college today must 
know exactly how and in what form the state will evaluate his 
decades of impeccable service. 
  When speaking about the situation to which the Finance 
Ministry has brought us today, people in the Army say: "They're 
just sending smoke up the chimney, they're making themselves 
busy by pulling apart dumplings!" There is nothing wrong with 
the soldiers' sense of humor; the important thing is that there 
should be nothing wrong with the sense of responsibility of the 
departmental arbiters of people's fate.

<F P=106> [From the "Military Courier" program: Video report by Igor </F>
Krondo] 
  [Text] [Krondo over video of air attack] The experience 
of local wars and armed conflicts during the second half of the 
20th century, including the wars in Korea and Vietnam, the 
Arab-Israeli wars, and operation Desert Storm indicates that the 
success of combat operations is determined largely by reliable 
air defenses. This accounts for the great attention which has 
been paid to the development of modern multiple-target SAM 
missile systems. Right now it is possible to claim with 
confidence that the Russian military-industrial complex is a 
world leader in this sphere. 
  Take for instance this multichannel SAM missile system, the 
S-300 PMO-1, which is in the Russian Army's arsenal. It is 
designed to destroy modern combat aircraft and cruise and 
ballistic missiles. Essentially, this system ensures 100 
percent destruction of aerodynamic targets within a range of 150 
km, and of ballistic missiles and their warheads within a range 
of 40 km. Minimum target altitude is 10 meters, and maximum 
altitude is the service ceiling of modern combat aircraft. What 
is more, the speed of the target is of no consequence. It is 
possible to hit six targets simultaneously, targeting them with 
up to 12 missiles. The S-300 PMO-1 SAM missile system is highly 
mobile. Either self-propelled or transported by rail or 
military transport aircraft, it can be moved to any region in a 
short space of time. And it takes only five minutes to deploy. 
Its foreign counterpart is the U.S. Patriot system, which 
received wide publicity following operation Desert Storm.

  [Text] Moscow, 9 Mar -- Boris Yeltsin has refused to 
receive the former U.S. President, Richard Nixon, who is paying 
an unofficial visit to Russia. He announced this during a short 
conversation with journalists at the Kremlin Wall, after the 
laying of wreaths at the grave of Yuriy Gagarin. 
  The Russian president said that: Nixon has met Rutskoy and 
Zyuganov, but the interesting thing is that he came here to meet 
me. After that, Yeltsin noted: I will not meet Nixon, the 
government will not receive him, and Filatov [Yeltsin's chief of 
staff] will not receive him. 
  It should be realized that Russia is a great country. It 
simply cannot be played around with like that, the president 
said, noting: I am impressed by the position taken by Bill 
Clinton, because he phoned me and distanced himself from Richard 
Nixon's trip." 
  Referring to Russian-U.S. relations, Yeltsin said that the 
two countries' foreign ministers were due to meet in Vladivostok 
shortly. He stated that: The U.S.-Russian partnership must be 
preserved and developed. The president noted that Russian-U.S. 
partnership: Is a great achievement that we worked very hard 
for, and we must not lose it. Moreover, I am convinced that we 
will not lose it, Yeltsin stressed. 
  Asked by the journalists about the Ames scandal in the 
United 
States, Yeltsin said: I would not like to draw any dramatic 
conclusions from this. He expressed hope that it should not and 
will not affect Russian-U.S. relations. Yeltsin believes that 
one should not get upset about the fact that both countries are 
conducting intelligence work.

  [Text] Moscow March 9 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and presidential chief of staff Sergey Filatov have 
called off their scheduled meetings with visiting ex-President 
of the United States Richard Nixon. 
  Kremlin sources, who said earlier that President Boris 
Yeltsin's meeting with Nixon was now "problematic", have just 
told ITAR-TASS that the Russian president has refused to meet 
the American visitor. 
  Competent sources told ITAR-TASS that the cancellation of 
these meetings was decided after the former American president 
met former Russian Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy, amnestied 
recently. 
  Nixon's initiative must have been seen as a sign of 
disrespect for the political will of the Russian leadership. 
  On Tuesday, Richard Nixon told journalists that Russian 
authorities had not hampered his contacts with the leaders of 
the oppositional forces. 
  But to all appearances, after demonstrating their democratic 
thinking, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Sergey Filatov reserved the 
right to view Nixon's contacts with opposition leaders, 
including one of the organisers of the armed resistance to 
President Yeltsin last autumn, as they saw fit.

  [Text] Moscow, 5 Mar -- There has been encouraging progress 
recently in the Bosnian settlement in several directions. It is 
important to build up on the positive impulse and try to 
reaffirm, rather that lose it, noted Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev on summing up his almost two-hours long 
discussion today with the Prime Minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Haris Silajdzic, who has arrived in Moscow. Russia's top 
diplomat described the talks as fruitful. 
  This positive assessment was also shared by his Bosnian 
counterpart. Saying that there are now prerequisites for 
resolving the conflict, he added: This momentum should not be 
lost. 
  We expect that the Russian Government will play a 
constructive role in continuing the talks on Bosnia, stated 
Silajdzic. Simultaneously, the prime minister spoke in favor of 
a more balanced Russian policy in some aspects of the Yugoslav 
crisis. We hope that the Russian battalion stationed around 
Sarajevo will play a positive role and make it possible to 
preserve the multi-ethnic nature of that city, he went on to say. 
  On the agreement to establish a Croat-Muslim federation, 
which has been achieved, he said that this agreement excludes no 
one. Obviously, its implementation is impossible without the 
Serbs, he pointed out. We made it clear that our agreement will 
also be offered to the Serb side. It is quite possible at the 
same time that now it is not ready to accept it. In this 
scenario, we will develop a new version, but it will still be 
based on the main premise -- the territorial integrity and 
sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Moscow, 9 Mar -- Lately there has been encouraging 
progress in several areas toward a settlement of the Bosnian 
crisis. The important thing now is not to lose, but on the 
contrary, to develop the positive impetus and try to consolidate 
it. This was stressed by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev when he took stock of the almost two-hour long talks he 
held today with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic, who is visiting Moscow. The Russian foreign minister 
described the talks as fruitful and frank. 
  The Bosnian guest shared the positive appraisal. Noting that 
prerequisites have emerged for settling the conflict, Silajdzic 
added: The opportunity must not be lost. It is time to move 
toward the establishment of peace in Bosnia. 
  We expect the Russian Government to play a constructive role 
in the continuation of the talks on Bosnia, Silajdzic said. At 
the same time the prime minister called for Russia to pursue a 
more balanced policy toward certain aspects of the Yugoslav 
crisis. We hope, he added, that the Russian battalion deployed 
around Sarajevo will play a positive role and make it possible 
to preserve Sarajevo as a multiethnic city. 
  For his part, Kozyrev said that Russian diplomacy always 
maintains a balanced stance with regard to the Yugoslav 
conflict. The minister stressed: We reject the discriminatory 
approach to the peoples of the former Yugoslavia and 
particularly Bosnia-Herzegovina. All these peoples and ethnic 
groups are near and dear to the Russians. 
  Regarding the reaching of an accord on the formation of a 
Croatian-Muslim federation, Silajdzic stressed that this 
agreement excludes no one. Of course, he indicated, it could 
not be implemented without the Serbs' consent. We clearly 
stated that our agreement would also be proposed to the Serb 
side. At the same time, it is quite possible that at the moment 
they are not ready to accept it. In that case, we will find 
some other option that is nonetheless based on the main thing -- 
namely the territorial integrity and sovereignty of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Silajdzic said that during his meeting with Kozyrev a whole 
range of issues of bilateral Bosnian-Russian relations were 
discussed. The prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina called, in 
particular, for the development of cultural cooperation. 
  The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned that Silajdzic is to 
depart from Moscow at about 1630 today.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Asia" program] </F>
  [Text] The Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society 
has recently issued a statement in connection with the fact that 
the Seoul authorities have attempted to take Koreans residing in 
Sakhalin to the ROK. Regarding this, Mr. (Yi Genari), chairman 
of the Russian Branch of the Pomminnyon International Committee 
to Promote Korean Reunification, came today to our Moscow radio 
station and spoke as follows: 
  [Begin (Yi Genari) recording, in Russian with simultaneous 
translation into Korean] First of all, I would like to remind 
you that there are approximately 500,000 Koreans in the 
territory of the former USSR. Among them, over 120,000 Koreans 
-- including scholars, artists, well-educated doctors, 
technicians, and agricultural officials -- live in Russia. All 
of them are now living and working in and greatly contributing 
to the economic, scientific, and cultural development of the CIS 
countries. All of them are deeply rooted in this land. 
  Speaking of the Koreans living in Sakhalin, all of them are 
workers who were forcibly taken into Sakhalin by the then 
Japanese imperialist aggressors from North and South Korea 
between 1938 and 1945. After the Japanese imperialists were 
defeated during WW II, the Japanese people who lived in Sakhalin 
were the only ones able to return to their home, but the Koreans 
had to stay there without their jobs. According to data provided 
by the Korean Association in Sakhalin, there are 1,700 Korean 
households in Sakhalin whose members were forced to live there 
before 1945. They are separated from their family members. 
  After receiving the statement issued by the Central 
Committee 
of the DPRK Red Cross Society, I have come to believe that the 
problems of Koreans in Sakhalin should be jointly solved by 
Russia and the DPRK, only after the Japanese Government makes an 
official apology for its past act of forcibly taking them into 
Sakhalin and makes compensations for it. Therefore, the issue of 
Korean immigration from Sakhalin is not a matter of 
humanitarianism as demanded by Seoul, but rather has emerged as 
a political matter. 
  In conclusion, I would like to express my deep appreciation 
to the Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society for the 
protection of the interest of all Koreans, those who live in 
North and South Korea, as well as in foreign countries, 
including the CIS countries. [end recording]

from the "Utro" program] 
  [Text] Military technical cooperation between Russia and 
India is continuing. This year the Indian budget envisages an 
increase of 20 percent in this area. Many link this fact with 
the purchase of Russian tanks. The question of whether India 
will actually purchase tanks from Russia or build them using our 
technology was discussed at a news conference at the Russian 
Ministry of Defense held by Vladimir Semenov, commander of the 
ground forces, as part of a return visit of his Indian 
colleague, Mr. Joshi. [Video shows Colonel Semenov and Joshi 
addressing news conference] 
  The main details pertaining to the signing of the 
Russian-Indian documents will be discussed at the level of the 
ministers of defense of the two countries, but it can already be 
said today that India will become a reliable partner in the 
sphere of exports of Russian military equipment and weapons. 
[Video shows Semenov speaking to camera] 
  [Begin Semenov recording] We have been linked over the past 
34 years by friendly relations in the sphere of military 
technical cooperation. In its time the Soviet Union did much to 
maintain India's defense capability at the proper level. But in 
recent years, the past three or four years, our mutual relations 
have weakened somewhat. The main aim of my visit to India and I 
think the reason for General Joshi's visit to Russia is to 
elevate mutual relations between the Russian Army and the Indian 
Army to a qualitatively new level. [end recording]

  [Text] Russia will "tougher react" to Ukraine's 
unauthorized use of part of Russian gas exported to Western 
Europe, the Russian Economics Ministry told Interfax. 
  According to "Gazprom," Ukraine continues to syphon off up 
to 
25 percent of Russian gas which goes to West Europe through the 
Ukrainian territory. As a result, "Gazprom" has to pay big 
fines to foreign consumers of Russian gas. Russia's hard 
currency losses amount to half a million dollars a day, the 
ministry experts said. 
  Well-informed sources in the same ministry told Interfax 
that 
Russia may demand Kiev pay the fines to foreign partners and 
reimburse its debt for Russian gas already delivered that 
experts estimate at 1.5 Tn rubles. 
  In addition, Moscow intends to demand guarantees of free 
transit of its gas through the Ukrainian territory at the talks 
between the heads of the Russian and Ukrainian gas complexes 
scheduled for March 10.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>
  [Text] Vladikavkaz March 9 TASS -- The situation has become 
sharply aggravated in the North Ossetian regions under state of 
emergency rule imposed by the Russian president's decree and to 
be in effect until March 31, 1994. 
  At about 6:00 on Wednesday, residents of the settlements of 
Chermen, Kurtat, Dachnoye, Saniba and Verkhny Komgaron, as well 
as Terek cossacks, blocked the main road between the villages of 
Oktyabrskoye and Kartsa in North Ossetia's Prigorodny District, 
brought traffic to a standstill and staged a rally of protest. 
  The action was prompted by the recent murder by armed 
bandits 
of two civilians from the settlement of Verkhny Komgaron located 
within the safety zone under control of Russian peacekeeping 
forces and local law-enforcement bodies, according to Gatsir 
Dzagoyev, head of the Prigorodny District's local 
self-government and a North Ossetian deputy. The protesters 
demanded that North Ossetian authorities, the temporary 
administration and investigation bodies expose the criminals. 
  Participants in the rally believe that troops assigned to 
the 
temporary administration do not perform their functions 
properly. They also accused the Russian Interior Ministry's 
investigation group investigating crimes in the zone under state 
of emergency rule of somewhat neglecting their official duties. 
  The Prigorodny District's residents also demanded that the 
state of emergency be lifted in North Ossetia from March 31 and 
that the temporary administration be dissolved. To substantiate 
their demand, the protesters stressed there were appropriate 
power structures in the republic capable of taking control over 
the situation and of settling all differences with Ingushetia. 
  According to Dzagoyev, who attended the rally together with 
an official of the temporary administration, villagers of the 
Prigorodny District would like these issues to be raised at the 
republican parliament's next session shceduled for late March. 
  Meanwhile, North Ossetian President Askharbek Galazov met on 
Wednesday the head of the temporary administration in North 
Ossetia and Ingushetia, Vladimir Lozovoi. They discussed the 
situation in the context of the current developments in the zone 
under state of mergency rule.

  [Text] Chechnya's Information and Press Department leader 
accused Russian Nationalities and Regional Policy Minister 
Sergey Shakhray of blocking negotiations between Moscow and 
Groznyy. In his interview with Interfax Wednesday Movladiy 
Udugov declared that Shakhray is directly responsible for the 
destabilization of the situation in the North Caucuses and the 
unsettledness of Russian- Chechen relations. 
  "We still hope that such politicians as Sergey Filatov or 
Viktor Chernomyrdin (leader of presidential administration and 
Russian premier -- INTERFAX) will take the negotiating process 
under their control. In an adverse situation, if Russian 
nationalities minister interferes into the negotiations they 
will inevitably windup in a dead alley," said Udugov. 
  Udugov expressed the opinion that on the issue of Chechnya's 
sovereignty (Chechnya insists on its official recognition) the 
greatest disagreement will arise at the upcoming negotiations in 
Moscow. In Udugov's opinion, it would be expedient to first 
discuss those issues which are not so controversial and then to 
start discussing the issue of Chechnya's independence. 
  "The Chechen party was always ready for negotiations with 
Russia at any level and on any issue and we welcome the 
statement of the head of the presidential administration Sergey 
Filatov on the necessity to normalize relations with Chechnya," 
said Udugov.

<F P=106> [Video interview with Ey.I. Nazdratenko, head of the </F>
Maritime Kray Administration, by correspondent B. Makarychev; 
place, date not given -- recorded; from the "Dalniy Vostok" 
program] 
  [Text] [Nazdratenko] This winter we were busy just 
surviving. At a meeting with the prime minister, when you meet 
the other heads of administrations, one hears: Vologda, 0 
degrees [Celsius] to 2 degrees above zero, or 0 degrees to minus 
1 degree. Of course, they do not understand our problems. 
Naturally, they have their own problems. I think that Moscow, 
which we all support so unanimously -- well, the streets are lit 
there, the houses are warm, they have money with which to buy 
fuel and food. It is obvious that this is the capital and should 
be treated with respect, but after the adoption of the new 
Constitution we are all equal as members of the Federation. 
However, we are far from equal financially. 
  [Makarychev] Your business trip to Moscow had to do with the 
work of the Federation Council. Nevertheless, I understand that 
you will again carry a proposal on a package of talks with the 
government. If it is not a secret, could you tell us about the 
main points of the package? What would you like to solve in 
Moscow? 
  [Nazdratenko] There are two kind of documents. The first 
kind is one which burns, bets, and screams about a current 
issue. The second package of documents concerns the strategic 
development of the Maritime Kray. 
  [Makarychev] Tell me, do you have any hopes that one day you 
might go to Moscow without carrying any documents asking for 
help? 
  [Nazdratenko] No. No. 
  [Makarychev] So, you have no such hopes for the near future? 
We will continue to beg? 
  [Nazdratenko] Yes. Because what we have here is a vicious 
circle. They tell us: support the institute of agriculture 
from your own budget, support all organizations from your own 
budget, support the handicapped, the pensioners, and the needy 
out of your own budget. At the same time, our own budget is 
funded by taxes on working industry, which is broken and on the 
verge of extinction. 
  [Makarychev] Are you not afraid that you will be accused, 
behind your back, of going to Moscow to blackmail the 
government, that you make us all go down on our knees and do not 
see any other methods? 
  [Nazdratenko] Tell me, was not Decree 1001 a promising one? 
Was it not a good thing which got destroyed later? The 
presidential representative sent coded messages to the effect 
that I was blackmailing the country and Moscow. Yet Moscow, by 
not sending funds to Arsenyev, Bolshoy Kamen and the defense 
factories, is it not thus blackmailing the residents of Maritime 
Kray? What is this? Therefore, this is no blackmail. If a 
person has worked, he must be paid for it. So pay this money to 
those who have worked. Of course, they can blame me, but I do 
not consider this to be blackmail. I think that this is the 
position of the Maritime Kray leadership in defending the 
interests of the Maritime Kray.

  [Text] St. Petersburg -- The SANKT-PETERBURGSKIYE 
VEDOMOSTI newspaper has reported that State Duma Deputies Ye. 
Krasnitskiy and A. Yegorov have appealed in their own right to 
the city prosecutor's office, the St. Petersburg and Oblast 
Internal Affairs Main Administration Administration for 
Combating Economic Crime, and the State Tax Inspectorate for St. 
Petersburg to carry out a check on the legality of a number of 
financial transactions sanctioned by B. Kurkova, leader of the 
"Petersburg--5 Kanal" state television and radio company. 
  The deputies, so the report says, presented the law 
enforcement agencies with documents which are in their view 
evidence of bribe-taking by officials, in particular B. Kurkova. 
The deputies also appealed to St. Petersburg Mayor A. Sobchak 
in an open letter which says inter alia: 
  "We consider it your moral duty to see to it that an 
objective investigation is carried out. We hope you will 
understand that there are grounds -- based on public opinion -- 
for fearing that you will apply official pressure in the 
investigation. We do not doubt your honesty and impartiality or 
your direct interest in the observance of law in the city."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Nizhniy Novgorod Television Network in 
Russian at 1735 GMT on 17 February carries its regular "Dramatis 
Personae" program, which features an interview with Nizhniy 
Novgorod Oblast Governor Boris Yefimovich Nemtsov. Asked by the 
anchorwoman about the results of British Prime Minister John 
Major's visit to Nizhniy Novgorod, Nemtsov replies that this was 
the first such visit in the centuries-old history of Nizhniy 
Novgorod. No Western leader has visited Nizhniy Novgorod since 
1221. 
  Nemtsov continues that this is the first time that he has 
seen a person from the West coming not just with promises, but 
with a concrete program supported by concrete millions of 
pounds. This program includes implementation of three major 
projects in Nizhniy Novgorod. The first project concerns 
investments into enterprises which have gone through the stage 
of privatization, but found themselves broke. This project is 
expected to get 4.8 million pounds. The second program concerns 
specialists who do not have enough skills in market economy, but 
need them very much. This training program will be funded by 
about 1 million pounds. The third is a program aimed at 
establishment of something like an all-Russian automobile 
alliance in Nizhniy Novgorod. 
  As for the political significance of the visit, Nemtsov 
believes that the British prime minister saw for himself that 
the money spent on technological aid to Russia was not wasted. 
The program of privatization of truck transportation and the 
land reform program have been developed with the support of the 
money provided by the British Government. Both programs are 
being implemented in Nizhniy Novgorod, and they will become 
models for all of Russia, in the opinion of the Russian 
government. 
  Speaking about an expected visit of the Russian prime 
minister, Nemtsov says that Nizhniy Novgorod has been waiting 
for that visit for two years already, that he invites the prime 
minister every time he sees him, but this time it seems he will 
come to Nizhniy Novgorod on 10 March. According to the 
anchorwoman, the mass media has been writing a lot about an 
alleged opposition between Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin lately. As 
far as Nemtsov knows, there is no such opposition between them. 
  Speaking about the recent visit of former Finance Minister 
Fedorov to Nizhniy Novgorod, Nemtsov says that Fedorov came at 
his invitation. He is a State Duma deputy and heads the 
commission for finances and banks. Nemtsov says that the 
purpose of Fedorov's visit was to get acquainted with the 
process of formation of local budgets, with the state of economy 
on the regional level, and to learn more about the work of 
commercial banks. In addition to that, Fedorov was interested 
in the notorious problem of the automobile building plant, 
because it was Fedorov who initiated the inspection at that 
plant. 
  There was a presentation of the cellular phone system in 
Nizhniy Novgorod that day. Speaking about its importance for 
Nizhniy Novgorod, Nemtsov says that Nizhniy Novgorod is the 
first provincial Russian city that got the cellular phone 
system. First, it will provide a possibility to make calls from 
absolutely anywhere and get connected to any place in the world. 
Second, it finally broke through the monopoly of one phone 
service for many years. Third, he hopes the quality of service 
will be much better, because there is competition now. This is 
a very expensive service, but the city has paid nothing for it. 
Investments of a million and a half dollars have been made into 
the development of the communications system in Nizhniy Novgorod. 
  Speaking about the lavish attention given to the forthcoming 
elections of a new mayor of Nizhniy Novgorod, Nemtsov says that 
it is understandable, because the mayor will head both the 
legislative and the executive branches of power in the city. 
The difficulty is that people will have to choose between two 
very worthy candidates -- Bednyakov and Krestyaninov. This is a 
very rare situation. Nemtsov says that Nizhniy Novgorod 
residents know both candidates very well, and they will be able 
to make their choice. He says that he knows both of them 
personally, and he will vote for Krestyaninov. 
  The city faces very serious problems because of the 
developing process of privatization. Nemtsov believes that 
there should be very rigid control over that process and over 
those who are involved in that. That control can be exercised 
by deputies, the independent mass media, the opposition, and the 
authorities. Nemtsov thinks that Krestyaninov understands the 
significance of the organs of representative power, and he will 
have no problems with higher-ranking authorities either. 
Besides, obvious problems of the city, such as transportation, 
crime, roads, cleanliness, etc., which are not as attractive as 
opening ceremonies of exhibits, are the problems that should 
nonetheless be dealt with every day. Nemtsov thinks that 
Krestyaninov could do that efficiently and calmly. Besides, he 
says that he is a normal man, and he can openly say that 
Krestyaninov is his friend, he is proud of that, and people may 
consider it the main reason why he is going to vote for him.

  [Text] Vienna March 9 TASS -- The international community 
should take active steps in order to resolve the crisis in 
Nagorno-Karabakh and stop the bloodshed in the region as soon as 
possible, said Jan Eliasson, chairman of the Minsk group for 
Karabakh settlement of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). 
  Speaking at a news conference in Vienna on Tuesday, Eliasson 
said that during his trip to the war zone he had met with 
Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev and Armenian President Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan. Both leaders called for the soonest possible end 
to the bloodshed. However, they have different approaches 
towards ways of solving the conflict, Eliasson said. 
  The Swedish diplomat believes the conflict cannot be solved 
by military means and called for looking for a political 
stage-by-stage settlement which should involve exchange of 
prisoners and creating conditions for the return of refugees. 
The problem of the disputed enclave's political status remains 
the biggest stumbling block. Solving this problem will require 
coordination of peace initiatives. Eliasson said he had had 
talks with Russian officials to this end. 
  The Azerbaijani president said earlier today in Beijing 
where 
he is currently on a visit that the reconsideration of the 
status of Nagorno-Karabakh was conditioned on certain terms. 
Among them he named "unconditional withdrawal of Armenian armed 
units from the occupied territory of Azerbaijan, territorial 
integrity and inviolability of borders." 
  Eliasson said that the CSCE Minsk group sees its role in 
sending representatives to the region to monitor ceasefire and 
to help find a political solution to the conflict. The proposal 
about CSCE observers is welcomed by all sides, including Russia, 
the ambassador pointed out. 
  At the same time he said the CSCE did not yet look deep into 
the question of bringing a disengagement force to the region. 
"We could also assist in the withdrawal of troops, normalisation 
of communications and trade, the return of refugees, and 
humanitarian aid matters", he said. 
  Eliasson said the success of peace settlement will depend on 
whether the sides involved in the conflict will manage to 
overcome mutual suspiciousness between the conflicting sides, 
build confidence in the military, political and humanitarian 
areas, including in cooperation with the International Red Cross 
Committee, and display "reasonable political will." 
  The ambassador pointed out that all who can influence the 
situation must work together and concertedly. This is why, he 
said, "We closely cooperate with Russia as a big mediator in the 
region".

  [Text] Today at the Palace of Parliament and Presidency in 
Vilnius, Presidents Algirdas Brazauskas and Ion Iliescu signed 
the friendship and cooperation treaty concluded between 
Lithuania and Romania. The accord on the mutual promotion and 
protection of investments, the protocol concluded between the 
Governments of Lithuania and Romania on the delivery of goods, 
services, and payments over 1994, and the protocol on the 
cessation of the validity of the Romanian-Lithuanian commercial 
accord signed in 1931 were also signed. 
  The signing of the documents was followed by a press 
conference, during which Presidents Algirdas Brazauskas and Ion 
Iliescu emphasized the significance of having signed those 
important documents, considering the similarities of various 
aspects in the domestic and international policies of Romania 
and Lithuania. There are enormous possibilities of cooperation 
both with respect to the establishment of market economies and 
the two countries' activity within European bodies, the 
Lithuanian president said. Upon turn, President Ion Iliescu 
stressed that the signing of the friendship and cooperation 
treaty between Romania and Lithuania, as well as that of the 
other economic accords express the political will to strengthen 
the ties between the two countries. Romania and Lithuania are 
proceeding together on the way of democratization and 
integration within united Europe, Romania's president added. 
  After that ceremony, the last point on the agenda was the 
visit paid by President Ion Iliescu to the Vilnius University, 
where he attended a meeting with the students and the teaching 
personnel of the university and delivered a speech, our special 
correspondents, Raluca Dana Cotruta and Simina Botar, report.

<F P=106> [News conference by Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas </F>
and Romanian President Ion Iliescu in the Lithuanian Seimas in 
Vilnius -- live; Brazauskas speaks in Lithuanian, with passage 
by passage translation into English; Iliescu speaks in English; 
correspondents speak in Lithuanian, Romanian, and English, with 
all questions translated into English -- processed from the 
English] 
  [Brazauskas] Our two countries today represented by the 
President and members of cabinet have signed a number of 
bilateral and very significant agreements. First of all I would 
like to single out the political treaty on friendship and 
cooperation between Lithuania and Romania. 
  Romania was one of the first countries to recognize the 
newly 
restored independence of Lithuania. [Word indistinct] the second 
half of this century has been quite alike. Since the 
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939 we underwent similar fate -- 
Lithuania was occupied and Romania lost Bessarabia. We all 
entered the period of (?the fear of) Socialism or, shall I say, 
the fear of influence of Stalinist oppression. 
  Now under the conditions of free development there are again 
similarities in our way: both of our countries have become 
members of the Council of Europe and both of our countries have 
already signed the Partnership for Peace agreement with NATO. 
  Further steps in our development are also quite similar -- 
Romania is already an associated member of the European Union 
while Lithuania is hoping to achieve this status perhaps this 
year. The possibilities for our cooperation in all spheres are 
huge too, because both of our countries are trying to 
consolidate the steps towards free market economy and towards 
the development of really democratic society. 
  Extending my gratitude to His Excellency President Iliescu 
and his delegation for visiting Lithuania I would like to wish 
the Romanian President and all the Romanian people all the best 
success and to achieve all the goals that they had set for 
themselves. 
  [Unidentified moderator] Now, His Excellency Ion Iliescu, 
the 
Romanian president. 
  [Iliescu] Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. First of all, 
I should like to express our thanks for the climate of 
friendship and for very good conditions of our visit, of our 
talks. 
  I should firstly underline the political significance of our 
visit. It is the first visit of a chief of state of Romania in 
the new, independent Lithuania. And therefore the signature of 
the political document, the treaty of [word indistinct] 
cooperation between our two states, and some economic agreements 
are an expression of our goodwill, of our political 
determination to strengthen and to develop our relations. (? At 
least could we see) even today, by visiting the [word 
indistinct], the history of our two countries has a lot of 
similarities. It is a history of the people which has fought 
during their history to preserve their independence, their 
sovereignty, their cultures, and now we are fighting to 
consolidate our new achievements on the way of democratization, 
of the strengthening of a state ruled by the law and to promote 
the very difficult process of transition from a state, a 
centralized system of economy to a market, efficient economy. 
  We (?are considering in) this very concentrated program of 
our visit and of our discussions a lot of problems, 
preoccupations, difficulties which we are passing through and I 
think the exchange of experience, the better knowledge of each 
other will be a very good contribution to strengthen our ties 
and to develop our common experience in this very difficult way 
of contemporary history of our countries and [words indistinct]. 
  We are both preoccupied to promote the integration of our 
countries in a new Europe, in a new, united Europe, to liquidate 
any remnants of the separation of our continent into (?walls) 
separated by the military means, by the political, ideological 
barriers and now by economic barriers which are much more 
visible. And we have to make a large effort to promote this new 
climate on the continent. As President Brazauskas underlined, we 
are going together on this way and I think we shall do it with 
success. We wanted to express our sympathy, our solidarity with 
the Lithuanian people and hope you the best in you efforts and 
in your national (?development). 
  [Unidentified correspondent from Romanian Radio] As it is 
Women's Day, I would like to ask both His Excellency the 
President of Lithuania and his excellency the president of 
Romania to allow Romanian Radio to ask two questions. 
  One of the topics of yesterday's talks was the question of 
minorities and relationships with neighboring countries. What 
is your specific point of view on this topic? 
  [Brazauskas] Indeed, we did talk about the issues of 
national 
minorities and relations with neighboring countries with His 
Excellency President Iliescu and we found out that our opinions 
on these issues were similar and, I would say, even coincided, 
because the establishment of friendly relations with neighboring 
countries is one of the chief goals of our foreign relations 
policy. We hope to sign in the nearest future friendship and 
cooperation agreements with Belarus and Poland. 
  As to ethnic minorities, I must say that ethnic minorities 
in 
Lithuania enjoy all the privileges and rights which are 
stipulated by our constitution and our laws and which are also 
stipulated by international documents on these matters. 
Lithuania is a member of the Council of Europe and it abides to 
all the stipulations in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. 
  [Iliescu] First of all for the women, I should like to 
express our congratulations and best wishes to all the women 
present in this hall with the occasion of Women's Day. 
  Secondly, in connection with the problem raised with 
(?satisfied discussion), as President Brazauskas said, I should 
underline two aspects of the problem because all our countries, 
and I think in all Europe, there does not exist any country 
which should not have national, ethnical minorities on their 
territory. Also, there is not any country which should not have 
their core nationals living on the territory of other states. 
In this connection there are also problems connected with the 
neighbor problems and historical problems which thus exist 
between neighbor countries in connection with this coexistence 
of the co-citizens or of the co-nationals living on the 
territory of the other country. 
  Of course, the problem of the national minorities and 
national and ethnical minorities is a question of the internal 
development of each country and only on the democratic basis, 
with the creation of the general frame of the individual 
liberties and the right of every member of the society, only in 
this frame the problems of the citizens belonging to different 
national minorities can be solved. And I think that with the 
democratic development of our country, with the new constitution 
which has the most important chapter connected to the rights and 
the liberties of the citizens, we have created the juridicial 
base to solve any problems for any citizen of the country, 
including those belonging to national minorities. 
  Of course, there are some general international, European 
[word indistinct] concerning the civil rights, which are 
including also the rights for the persons belonging to the 
national minorities. And we have such a provision in our 
constitution that any international juridicial provision is 
(?prevalent) to any of our national juridicial provision 
concerning the rights and liberties of the citizen. So we are 
ready always to align ourselves to any international 
regulations, provisions, agreements on the international level, 
including European level. 
  But, of course, there is some conditions which is creating 
normal or un-normal relations between neighboring countries. 
When some state, or leader of one state, is proclaiming their 
right to intervene in the regulation of the activities of the 
representative organizations of some national minorities on the 
territory of other countries, it is already a source of tension 
between the states. Or some proclamation (?in the last period) 
for the so-called territorial, ethnical self-determination, it 
is also a principle which is not in accordance with the general 
international and European [word indistinct] of the development 
of the trust between nations and between states. It's a sort of 
theory of bantustanization of some such local community. I 
think not on this basis the rights and the liberties of the 
national minorities could be provided, but in accordance with 
legislation which does exist in every country and with a general 
democratic rule of the relations between the citizens of each 
country. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President Brazauskas, Mr. 
President Iliescu: Can you point out, please, the ways in which 
the two countries are planning to contribute to the maintenance 
and strengthening of the stability, security and peace on our 
continent? Thank you. 
  [Brazauskas] I would like to say that our active 
participation in the Partnership for Peace system shows that our 
countries are looking for strong and guaranteed security 
systems, such as we see in the activities of NATO, for example. 
I also hope that other countries will be signing the 
Partnership for Peace agreement and this will provide a very 
good security basis for Central and Eastern European countries. 
I would like to express a hope that Russia, too, signs this 
agreement, then the question itself of dividing Europe into 
military or some other kind of bloc will no longer be existing 
at all. 
  [Iliescu] I think there are two elements for the (?general 
stability). There is from the one side the internal stability 
of every country, and we are making all the efforts to stabilize 
politically and economically our country to become a factor of 
stability in our geographical zone and on the continent. 
Secondly, there are the activities of external relations, 
firstly the good relations with our neighbors, our contribution 
by bilateral contacts and multilateral contacts to eliminate the 
sources of conflict and tension which exist in our zone. And 
Romania has (?this privilege) to live in such a zone with two 
big sources of tensions and open conflict -- Yugoslavia from one 
side and the former Soviet Union, with different sources of 
tension and conflict, from the other side. 
  We are making all efforts, with our modest possibilities, to 
contribute to this activity, international activity, to 
eliminate these sources of the conflict. And also our 
participation in the international body, the Conference for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which can (?become) such a 
general frame for the stabilization and security on the 
continent. Our participation in the Partnership for Peace and 
our connection with NATO, with European Council, with European 
institutions -- all this frame of our external activities are 
interconnected with the preoccupation to secure more stability 
and security on the continent. 
  [Moderator] The last question is from Baltic News Service 
Agency. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] There were two questions, the 
first one to both of the presidents: can we draw from the 
meetings that you have had that there is a possibility of a 
Baltic and Black Sea union? And the second question was to Mr. 
Brazauskas, about the possibility of a new trend in Lithuanian 
foreign policy towards the Black Sea countries. 
  [Brazauskas] Of course, Romania is on the Black Sea and 
Lithuania is on the Baltic Sea and we can and must use to the 
best advantage our geographical situation in order to promote 
economic and trade relations. As to the second question, I must 
say that Lithuania has been using every possibility to establish 
and to improve relations with all states, first of all with 
neighboring states and also with states that are further away. 
With Romania we have many similarities in our domestic life and 
in our outside activities and the signing of the important 
documents today expands the sphere of our relations and leads us 
to better links with countries of the Black Sea basin. 
  [Iliescu] I think that any initiative, [words indistinct] to 
promote the cooperation between the two states and to promote 
such zones of stability and security on our continent. From 
this point of view, the development of initiatives of the Baltic 
Sea from one side and the Black Sea from the other side are such 
initiatives which have such an objective -- to promote stability 
in our region, to promote the cooperation between our states. 
  Of course, I cannot speak about the union of two zones. We 
should develop firstly such cooperation in our zone, but such 
interconnections are of course beneficial and our presence here 
is an expression of our desire to develop such interconnections. 
More, I could say. We have visited in the morning the Trakai 
[town near Vilnius, ancient residence of Lithuanian rulers]. On 
our perception, "Trakai" is coming from the nomination of a 
great family of people of Asian civilization, the (?Thracians). 
Our ancestors, that was the Prince of (?Thrace). If the 
(?Thracians) could develop such a zone of interconnection and 
coexistence from Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea with the Baltic 
Sea, why could it not be able for our generation to develop such 
and interconnection and such a cooperation? I think it is quite 
realistic to speak about.

  [Text] Moscow, 9 Mar -- Boris Yeltsin has refused to 
receive the former U.S. President, Richard Nixon, who is paying 
an unofficial visit to Russia. He announced this during a short 
conversation with journalists at the Kremlin Wall, after the 
laying of wreaths at the grave of Yuriy Gagarin. 
  The Russian president said that: Nixon has met Rutskoy and 
Zyuganov, but the interesting thing is that he came here to meet 
me. After that, Yeltsin noted: I will not meet Nixon, the 
government will not receive him, and Filatov [Yeltsin's chief of 
staff] will not receive him. 
  It should be realized that Russia is a great country. It 
simply cannot be played around with like that, the president 
said, noting: I am impressed by the position taken by Bill 
Clinton, because he phoned me and distanced himself from Richard 
Nixon's trip." 
  Referring to Russian-U.S. relations, Yeltsin said that the 
two countries' foreign ministers were due to meet in Vladivostok 
shortly. He stated that: The U.S.-Russian partnership must be 
preserved and developed. The president noted that Russian-U.S. 
partnership: Is a great achievement that we worked very hard 
for, and we must not lose it. Moreover, I am convinced that we 
will not lose it, Yeltsin stressed. 
  Asked by the journalists about the Ames scandal in the 
United 
States, Yeltsin said: I would not like to draw any dramatic 
conclusions from this. He expressed hope that it should not and 
will not affect Russian-U.S. relations. Yeltsin believes that 
one should not get upset about the fact that both countries are 
conducting intelligence work.

correspondent Gennadiy Lunev] 
  [Text] Almaty March 9 TASS -- There was a strong turnout at 
the elections to the Kazakh Parliament and local bodies of 
self-rule, which were held in Kazakhstan on March 7. According 
to preliminary results, some 75 per cent of the electorate went 
to the polls, or five-six per cent more than most bold home and 
foreign forecasters predicted. 
  According to chairman of the Central Electoral Commission 
Karatay Turysov, organisers of the elections were especially 
worried over northern regions in the republic, where 
Russian-speaking population and opposition politicians, 
especially among Cossacks, prevail. 
  They tried to dampen the high spirits of Kazakh voters. 
However, there was no boycott of the elections there. On the 
contrary, the percentage of voters who participated in the 
elections, was higher in the north than the country-wide average 
-- over 80 per cent. 
  As for allegations by some Western mass media that there 
were 
numerous violations of the election procedure, Turysov dismissed 
them as groundless. No serious complaints have been sent to the 
Central Electoral Commission for the time being. 
  Those which have been filed, will be thoroughly examined, 
Turysov stressed, adding that appropriate conclusions will be 
made on each case.

Kharchenko] 
  [Text] Dushanbe March 9 TASS -- Viktor Repin, a serviceman 
of the collective peacekeeping force stationed in Tajikistan, 
fell victim to unidentified gunmen. 
  Private Repin was on duty at a checkpoint of the 191st 
Motorised Rifle Regiment of the 201st Motorised Rifle Division 
stationed in Kurgan-Tyube when he was killed at 19.30 on Tuesday 
by gunmen from a passing car which fled to an unknown 
destination. An investigation was launched, Colonel-General 
Boris Pyankov, commander of the collective peacekeeping force in 
Tajikistan, told ITAR-TASS on Wednesday. 
  Commenting on the tragic incident, the general said the 
crime 
was committed by forces that seek to set the peacekeeping force 
and the people of Tajikistan at loggerheads, to destabilise the 
situation in the republic and provoke an armed conflict. 
  Way back in autumn and winter, military experts had 
predicted 
an increased activity of various terrorist sabotage groups on 
the republic's territory, pointing out that those groups would 
srping into still greater activity both inside Tajikistan and on 
the Tajik-Afghan border as the warm season arrives, Pyankov 
said. The commander made it clear unambiguously that most 
resolute measures would be taken to ensure the safety of 
peacekeepers. 
  Touching upon the operational situation in the border areas 
of Tajikistan and on the Tajik-Afghan border, Pyankov said it 
remains complex. Unidentified gunners killed a local resident 
in Panj district in southern Tajikistan on March 8. The 
Navrangan post and the 13th picket of the Moskovskiy 
border-guarding detachment were fired upon on Tuesday afternoon 
from a mortar and recoilless rifles on afghan territory. The 
foe's weapon emplacements were later neutralised. There were no 
losses among Russian border guards.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 05, BNS -- The European Union [EU] in a 
statement welcomed progress in the talks between Latvia and 
Russia on the Skrunda radar base, the DIENA daily newspaper 
reported with reference to the Latvian Embassy in Brussels. 
  The agreement foresees the radar base at Skrunda, Latvia, to 
operate under Russian command during the next 4 years and to be 
then dismantled within 18 months. 
  The EU in the statement says that the temporary agreement on 
the Skrunda base will contribute to progress in Latvian-Russian 
talks on the withdrawal of Russian troops. The EU regards the 
agreement as containing no threat to Latvia's sovereignty, and 
calls for approval of the document. 
  The good will demonstrated during the talks gives hope that 
good- neighborly relations will be established between Latvia 
and Russia, the EU statement says.

  [Text] Moscow, 9 Mar -- "For the first time in three or 
four decades, Russia will not import grain, linen or wool this 
year." This was stated to journalists by Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin following the wreath-laying ceremony at Yuriy Gagarin's 
tomb at the Kremlin Wall. 
  Boris Yeltsin noted that "we have enough grain to last us 
until the new harvest." He also emphasized that whereas three 
years ago "we talked about famine, today we are saying that food 
will be fully provided." 
  The Russian president also said that currently "we are 
interested in achieving variety and quality to match foreign 
standards, as well as in tackling the issue of prices." "This is 
what we will be working on," the president stressed.

  [Text] The fact that Russian Communist Leader Gennadiy 
Zyuganov met former U.S. President Richard Nixon proves that the 
U.S. leadership wants to "understand Russian reality better." 
This will give a more realistic picture to U.S. official 
circles, the Communist Party's press service announced. 
  Zyuganov pointed out that the Russian Communist Party and 
all 
Russian patriotic movements were "concerned over the inflexible 
approach of the U.S. to Russian political forces and believed 
that the growth in anti-American sentiment in Russia and the 
U.S. unconditional support for the present unpopular executive 
power have something in common." 
  Commenting on the situation in Russia, the Communist leader 
suggested that the shock-therapy policy was dangerous for Russia 
and could provoke social unrest. However, he said the Russian 
Communist Party rejected both the right and the left radicalism 
and was ready to cooperate with any political forces which stood 
for "restoration of a strong Russia as a guarantee for peace and 
stability in the whole world." 
  Nixon had a conversation with former vice president 
Aleksandr 
Rutskoy who had been released on February 26 in accordance with 
the resolution on political amnesty. 
  The ex-U.S. president also met with the leader of the 
Russian 
Unity and Concord's parliamentary faction, Minister for 
Nationalities and Regional Policies, Sergey Shakhray. 
  A meeting between Nixon and the Liberal Democratic Party's 
(LDP) Leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is also expected. 
  As it was earlier reported, the LDP received 63 seats in the 
State Duma after the December parliamentary elections.

  [Text] Armenian First Deputy Foreign Minister Zhirair 
Liparitian said his republic reaffirmed its position to the new 
Chairman of the Minsk Group for the Settlement in 
Nagorno-Karabakh of the Conference on Security and Cooperation 
in Europe (CSCE), Jan Eliasson, at the recent talks in Yerevan. 
In the first place, Armenia seeks a ceasefire in the conflict 
area. However, this has become impossible without the presence 
of separating forces there. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Yerevan today, Liparitian 
pointed to the need for the entire world community to combine 
its efforts for the successful resolution of the issue. 
  "Russia and the CSCE must submit a united plan to the 
warring 
sides," Liparitian pointed out. He said Eliasson had agreed 
with this when he stayed in the Armenian capital. 
  The Armenian diplomat said armed formations must be 
withdrawn 
from certain territories after the establishment of a ceasefire 
in accordance with documents developed by Russia and the CSCE. 
Liparitian pointed out that both the Russian plan and the CSCE 
program envisioned a pull-out of Armenian forces from all 
territories they occupy, except for Lachin, while Azerbaijanis 
will have to leave Mardakert. The status of the Shaumian 
(Geranboi) district will remain as subject to further 
negotiations. 
  After this, vital communications should be unblockaded and 
the political status of Nagorno-Karabakh should be submitted for 
consideration by the CSCE Minsk Group, according to Armenia.

  [Text] Yerevan, March 8 (SNARK) -- World community should 
offer the plan how to regulate the Karabakh conflict, [said] 
Zhirair Liparityan, first deputy foreign affairs minister of 
Armenia. Speaking to the journalists in Yerevan he mentions the 
primary task the Armenian leaders should solve -- to guarantee 
the cease-fire. "Then troops should be withdrawn from the front 
line and blockade existing in the region should be stopped. And 
as the final point -- the discussion of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
status at the Minsk conference", said Liparityan. Mr. 
Liparityan also mentioned that the withdrawal of the military 
groups out of the Lachin humanitarian corridor which connects 
Armenia to Karabakh is out of the question. 
  There should be mentioned, according to Mr. Liparityan, 
Turkey wouldn't want to see Russian disjunctive [disengagement] 
troops in the zone of the conflict. Nevertheless, the armistice 
is impossible without the participation of the peace-making 
forces.

  [Text] The mediatory efforts and diplomatic exchanges on a 
settlement of the Karabakh conflict have again intensified. It 
could be stated that the new efforts to find a settlement within 
the CSCE framework, particularly Minsk Group Chairman Jan 
Eliasson's visit to Moscow and to this region, were to a certain 
extent prompted by the latest Russian initiative. 
  The news conference held today by Armenian First Deputy 
Foreign Minister Zhirair Liparityan was devoted to these 
developments and to his latest visits to Paris, Ankara, and 
Tehran. 
  In summing up all these developments, Mr. Liparityan noted 
that regrettably the CSCE's efforts have so far produced no 
results. He assessed Jan Eliasson's efforts as a serious 
attempt to revive that mediatory mission. 
  Mr. Liparityan then set out Armenia's position for the 
settlement of the problem. He said that at present priority is 
being given to the establishment of the cease-fire, which is 
impossible to achieve without separating the forces. And 
finally, the international mediatory efforts should be brought 
together and harmonized. This was in reference to the mediatory 
efforts of Russia and the CSCE. The international community must 
present to the conflicting sides one single plan which, besides 
the cease-fire issue, should spell out all those possible steps 
that would create an atmosphere of mutual confidence and allow 
talks to resume on the basic problem. Zhirair Liparityan 
considers these steps to be: The withdrawal of troops from 
certain territories, the lifting of the blockades, and finally 
an agreement to resolve the status of Nagorno-Karabakh at the 
Minsk conference. 
  Zhirair Liparityan said: We have presented this approach not 
only to Mr. Eliasson but also to Paris, Ankara, and Tehran. 
But, I reiterate that the highest priority is the establishment 
of a cease- fire.

  [Text] Tension persists in the southeast of the Karabakh 
war front. The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army Press 
Service has reported that the Karabakh formations repeatedly 
halted the enemy's attacks toward Fizuli yesterday. For the 
past six days the Azerbaijani troops have been trying to break 
through the NKR's forward defense lines in the sector. 
  Various types of guns were used to resume shelling of 
Karabakh positions in this sector this morning. 
  Relative calm prevails on the other war fronts. 
  The Armenian Defense Ministry Press Service has just 
reported 
that relative calm is also prevailing on Armenia's borders.

  [Text] The Karabakh conflict and CSCE and Russia's peace 
plans were discussed by Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan 
and CSCE Minsk Group Chairman Jan Eliasson in Yerevan Monday, 
officials in the president's press service told Interfax. 
  Following the meeting Eliasson described the talks he had 
with Armenian, Karabakh and Azerbaijan leaders as "interesting 
and constructive." He expressed the hope that the peace process 
could be stepped up by the Minsk Group. 
  Eliasson told journalists that an agreement would soon be 
made on sending international observers into the war zone. He 
admitted that the issues of a truce, troop withdrawal and 
security guarantees for the population had not been resolved and 
said that they would be discussed jointly with Russia. 
  Speaking of Moscow's mediation, in particular of Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's efforts, Eliasson said that all 
parties should act in unison so as to obtain the best possible 
results. 
  He told Interfax that the warring parties appreciated the 
urgent need to resolve the Karabakh problem politically and this 
was a major achievement. For this reason, he believed, the 
CSCE, notably its Minsk Group, activity should not be regarded 
as unproductive.

  [Text] Stepanakert, March 8 (SNARK) -- "Main part of the 
humanitarian relief coming from international organizations and 
single states for the Azerbaijani refugees is being used by the 
Azerbaijani authorities to cover the military expenditures and 
to acquire new kinds of weapons", Kamo Abrahamyan, Head of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh State Department of National Security, told 
journalists. 
  According to Mr. Abrahamyan, State Department of National 
Security is aware of the facts of purchasing new kinds of 
military hardware in Ukraine spending humanitarian 40 million 
dollars sent by Turkey Government. 500,000 USD [U.S. dollars] 
UK sent to the UN fund for the Azerbaijani refugees and 1 
million USD supplied by the Irani Central Bank and multiple 
investments of some oil companies of the world were spent to buy 
the shells for "Grad" launchers. 
  All the facts show Azerbaijani course to involve all these 
humanitarian relief suppliers into the war.

  [Text] Armenia's opposition has formed a "shadow cabinet." 
  The 39-member coalition shadow government, whose composition 
was published on Tuesday and is to be put before President Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan, is headed by ex-prime minister Vazgen Manukian,

Movement and today one of the leaders of the National Democratic 
Union. 
  National Democratic Union member David Vardanian, head of 
the 
parliamentary Foreign Relations Commission, has become the

Ter-Petrosyan's former national security adviser Ashot 
Manucharian has been appointed interior minister, while the post

of the Armenian Communist Party. The cabinet also includes ten 
members of the present government.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] Russia's call for convening another international 
conference on the Middle East in Madrid gained support from the 
conflicting sides and from the other cosponsor of the peace 
process, the USA. This statement was made at Wednesday's 
briefing in Moscow by Russia's First Deputy Foreign Minister, 
Igor Ivanov, who had just returned from a tour of Mideast 
countries. 
  According to him, "the well-planned action" in Hebron, where 
an Israeli settler discharged a submachine gun and killed about 
60 Palestinians, "disrupted the entire negotiating process and 
inflicted a mortal wound on the emerging understanding." "The 
tragedy in Hebron gave rise to a wave of activity among those 
who oppose the peace process," the diplomat stressed. 
  The goal of his mission, he explained, was to evaluate the 
situation that took shape in the wake of the tragedy in Hebron, 
and discuss the possibility of "reciprocal compromises". "In 
the course of contacts the issue of security guarantees in the 
occupied territories rose to the foreground," Ivanov said. 
  The diplomat called for adopting by the U.N. Security 
Council 
as soon as possible a resolution that would guarantee safety for 
the population in the occupied territories, and stipulate 
conditions for international presence there. "It's impossible 
to resume the negotiating process there at a stroke. A tragedy 
has occurred, and old conditions are no longer satisfactory. 
What is needed is actions designed to guarantee that such 
things will not happen again, and conducive to the 
implementation of agreements already reached," he pointed out.

Ukraine have a secret agreement on the joint use of the Baykonur 
space-vehicle launching complex. 
  Konstantin Zatulin told a news conference in Almaty, where 
he 
had been monitoring the parliamentary elections as an 
international observer, that Russia and Kazakhstan were going to 
enter into a treaty on the further use of Baykonur. The 
document was due to be signed by the two countries' presidents 
in Moscow on March 30, he said. 
  Commenting on a meeting he had with Kazakh Deputy Prime 
Minister Yerik Asanbayev, Zatulin said Kazakhstan's leadership 
preferred not to bring up the dual citizenship issue, but that 
the next parliament might consider giving Russian the status of 
an official language.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March (ITAR-TASS) -- Today's Moscow 
newspapers focus on the 60th birth anniversary of the world's 
first cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. 
  The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper writes: "Let us devote a few 
kind words to the first cosmonaut along with the whole world 
which marks Gagarin year at the call of the U.N. Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural organisation. Do not shun idealisation. 
After all, we should have some ideals". 
  The TRUD newspaper carries reminiscences by Cosmonaut no. 2 
Gherman Titov about Gagarin. "Gagarin preserved dignity, despite 
the hard test of world-wide fame and general love. His fate is 
like a sun-drenched smile of Russia." 
  Writing about Gagarin, the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper runs 
an exclusive interview with Valeri Alaverdov, first deputy 
managing director of the Russian Space Agency, under the 
headline "We've Gained Experience of Man's Longest Stay in 
Space". He comments on the Russian Federal Space Programme up 
to the year 2000 which was recently approved by the government. 
  The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper writes that "Gagarin was 
brought up by the Soviet socialist state which inculcated him 
with high spiritual qualities". The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA 
newspaper prints a feature on Gagarin. 
  ROSSIYSKIE VESTI prints an article by chairman of the state 
property committee Anatoli Chubais, noting that the voucher 
privatisation in the country will end on June 30, 1994, as 
planned, despite any changes in the situation. 
  "The post-privatisation operation of enterprises is the key 
element for us now," he stresses. Therefore, we are 
increasingly shifting our activities to creating sources of 
financing privatised enterprises." 
  The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper describes ongoing military 
reforms in the country, regarding them as a top priority for the 
state. "The armed forces have entered the second stage of their 
restructuring which will end in 1995. It is highly probable 
that its tasks will be accomplished, despite the difficult 
economic situation in the country." 
  The same newspaper carries an interview with the former 
assistant of the U.S. military attache, retired 
Lieutenant-Colonel James Halbrook. He noted that Russia's 
golden age is still ahead. 
  When Russia, designer of numerous technologies challenging 
world standards, will gain stability, it will turn into a 
mammoth Japan, although this comparison, may be, is not very 
apt, the Lieutenant-Colonel continued. 
  The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper prints an article on 
stepped-up activities of American diplomacy near Russia's 
southern borders, stressing that consequences of these 
activities "can be unpredictable, including for the United 
States". 
  The newspaper notes that Washington can "achieve an 
unheard-of strategic advantage peacefully or with a minimum use 
of military force. Coming to the region of the post-Soviet 
south, the United States will turn to be in the rear of several 
states to which the U.S. has or can have claims (Iran, 
Afghanistan, Iraq, China, Pakistan, India and, of course, 
Russia)." 
  The same newspaper informs its readers of a meeting between 
U.S. ex-president Richard Nixon, now on a private visit in 
Moscow, and former Russian Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy, 
leader of the Free Russia Party. 
  Rutskoy said that the party's task should be struggle 
against 
authorities with "peaceful parliamentarian means". 
  The PRAVDA newspaper also reports a meeting between Nixon 
and 
Russian Communist Party Leader Gennadiy Zyuganov. It singles 
out the latter's words that the Russian Communist Party "does 
not embrace either right-wing or left-wing radicalism and is 
ready to cooperate with all political forces championing the 
revival of a strong Russia". 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA calls on the Russian Federation of 
Independent Trade Unions to step up its activities. In turn, 
first deputy chairman of this federation Aleksey Surikov writes 
in the same newspaper what interferes with unions' reformation 
work. 
  According to Surikov, these are inner problems and 
contradictions, on the one hand, and strong outside pressure 
from authorities and various political movements and parties, on 
the other.

  [Text] Yerevan, March 9 (SNARK)--Over the half of Yerevan 
citizens think that Armenia should enter the ruble zone. These 
are the results of the public opinion poll carried out in 
February by Social Research Center of the National Academy of 
Armenia, among 600 citizens. Only 13 per cent of respondents 
are of the opinion that there is no need of entering the ruble 
zone, since Armenia introduced its own national currency -- dram. 
  Moreover, the head of the Center Gevork Poghosian pointed 
out 
the fact, that only 4.5 per cent of Yerevan citizens believe in 
stability of dram. About the half -- 44.8 per cent -- are 
certain the national currency will devaluate, and 29 per cent 
think dram will finally yield to Russian ruble.

  [Text] Almaty March 10 TASS -- Negotiations on the status 
of cosmodrome Baykonur, which began here late night between 
Kazakhstan and Russia, continue today behind closed doors. 
  However, none of the officials participating in the 
negotiations makes a special secret of the purpose and tendency 
of the talks. The delegations, headed by Kazakhstan's state 
counsellor Tulegen Zhukeyev and Russian space agency general 
director Yuriy Koptev, are forging rapprochement between the two 
countries on the status of the ex-Soviet space port and the rent 
Russia is asked to pay for its lease. 
  Progress is hampered by Kazakhstan's demand that Russia, the 
legal successor to the former Soviet Union pay ecological 
damages caused to the regions bordering on Baykonur throughout 
the years of its operation. 
  If the negotiations end successfully, the status of Baykonur 
will be put on the agenda of the upcoming meeting between 
President Boris Yeltsin and President Nursultan Nazarbayev at 
the end of March. 
  The two countries will then sign documents on the status and 
use of Baykonur on a new basis.

  [Text] Preparations for the summit between the presidents 
of Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation, Nursultan Nazarbayev 
and Boris Yeltsin, are in full swing. The two presidents will 
meet at the end of the month. Most subjects to be discussed at 
the meeting have already been carefully prepared. 
  In Kazakhstan itself, votes in the republic's first 
parliamentary elections are still being counted. According to 
provisional figures, about 75 percent of the electorate took 
part in the elections, which were for the Supreme Kenges and 
local councils. The organizers of the polls had certain worries 
about the northern part of the republic, where the 
Russian-speaking community predominates. However, there was no 
boycott, although foreign observers are saying that the 
elections were not completely free and fair. According to Radio 
France Internationale, Andranik Migranyan, an adviser to the 
Russian president, who went to Almaty to monitor the elections, 
said that an attempt was made to ensure that the new parliament 
is dominated by Kazakh deputies rather than by representatives 
of other ethnic groups. 
  Kazakhstan's Central Electoral Commission naturally rejects 
the allegations that there have been numerous contraventions of 
voting procedures. The commission's chairman, Karatay Turysov, 
described them as being clearly exaggerated. The complaints 
which have already been received are being painstakingly 
checked, Turysov said, and the necessary conclusions will be 
drawn from each of them.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Loshchilin] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 9 Mar -- "I thank U.S. President Bill 
Clinton and everyone with whom I had contacts here for their 
kind feelings toward our snall country and their understanding 
of its problems. We have received promises of as much support 
as possible," Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of the Georgian 
state, said on Tuesday, summing up the results of his official 
visit to the U.S. capital at a news conference at the National 
Press Club in Washington. 
  "It is quite natural that the attention of the world has 
been 
focused on the political processes in Russia and on whether it 
will succeed in building a new, truly democratic state," E. 
Shevardnadze noted. "The West can and should assist in this 
process, but if it views events in Russia in isolation from what 
is happening in other former Soviet republics it will have to 
pay a very high price. I tried to explain in my conversations 
that despite the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the 
territory which it occupied remains a single socio-economic 
space where there is still a close interconnection between 
cultures and social thought. That is why I am convinced that 
all the new independent states should be viewed as a whole. 
Otherwise, the stability of even the largest and most 
influential of them may be undermined by instability on its 
borders". 
  Earlier on Tuesday E. Shevardnadze had meetings in 
Washington 
with World Bank president Lewis Preston and International 
Monetary Fund managing director Michel Camdessus. The expansion 
of cooperation with the world's largest multinational 
credit-lending and financial organisations in advancing the 
republic's economy was discussed, Georgian Deputy Prime Minister 
Irakli Menagarishvili, who took part in the talks, told 
ITAR-TASS. "The meetings were held in a constructive and warm 
atmosphere. E. Shevardnadze assured his interlocutors that, 
notwithstanding all the difficulties connected with military 
operations and their consequences, Georgia firmly intends to go 
ahead with the market reform policy. He outlined our 
government's plans in this respect and urged the World Bank and 
IMF leaders to help the republic resolve the complex economic 
problems facing it. Support for the Georgian national monetary 
units was discussed at the talks," I. Menagarishvili said. The 
same day the head of the Georgian state visited the Capitol 
where he had a series of meetings with the heads of committees 
of the House of Representatives and the Senate of the U.S. 
Congress. The main subject there was the problem of 
humanitarian, technical and financial aid to the forer Soviet 
republic. "I hope that I succeeded in convincing the legislators 
to allocate additional funds to Georgia," in addition to the $70 
million which President Bill Clinton promised to grant this 
year, E. Shevardnadze said in reply to a question by an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent. 
  E. Shevardnadze began the third day of his visit to 
Washington with a short working lunch with James Wolsey, 
director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. The Georgian 
delegation was unable to tell the ITAR-TASS correspondent 
anything about the nature of the issues discussed, because the 
conversation in the guest residence of the republican leader was 
one-on-one. It is no secret, however, that the CIA is assisting 
Tbilisi in training its national security forces and the 
personal guard of the head of state. 
  After concluding the Washington part of his visit to the 
United States, E. Shevardnadze flew to New York. Today he is 
due to speak at the UN Security Council and to set out the 
Georgian Government's position on questions of the prospects for 
a settlement in Abkhazia and for sending international 
peace-keeping forces to the conflict zone.

  [Text] United Nations, 10 Mar -- Georgian Head of State 
Eduard Shevardnadze held a news conference here on Wednesday in 
connection with the UN Security Council's discussion of the 
situation in Abkhazia. After the Security Council meeting he 
held a brief news conference, where he stated, in particular: 
"The Georgian side came to the Security Council session with 
good ideas. It was very important for us to know to what degree 
the point of view of the Georgian leadership on the conflict in 
Abkhazia coincides with that held by the Security Council 
members. I would like to note with satisfaction that our views 
and those of the Security Council members coincide on most of 
the fundamental issues; our views coincide on issues relating to 
Georgia's territorial integrity and the creation of safe 
conditions for the return of refugees and for the stationing of 
peacekeeping forces in the region." 
  Touching on further UN measures regarding the Abkhazian 
conflict, Shevardnadze said: "After studying the situation the 
UN secretary general will deliver a report to the Security 
Council; this will take place on 21 March. On the basis of this 
report the Security Council will adopt a decision on sending 
peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia." 
  Shevardnadze reported that in the course of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian talks held at the UN headquarters work on 
documents has not been yet concluded. "Work on them will be 
continued in Geneva later," he said. He stated that the Geneva 
talks should be resumed before 20 March. 
  An ITAR-TASS correspondent asked whether a plan for 
stationing peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia was discussed at his 
meeting with President Clinton. "The issue relating to the need 
to send peacekeeping forces was discussed with President Clinton 
in principle, and in this respect we reached good 
understanding," E. Shevardnadze answered. 
  Asked whether it would suit Georgia if Russian troops were 
part of the peacemaking forces, E. Shevardnadze said: 
"Absolutely, with the participation of Russian troops and those 
of other countries. As to what other countries will be taking 
part, it is not of any fundamental importance to us." On the 
issue of the proportion of Russia's participation in operations, 
he stressed: "Everything will be decided at the Security Council 
sitting. It is not a very significant issue for us. What is 
important for us is that this operation is taking place under 
the aegis of the United Nations."

  [Text] New York, 10 Mar -- "I am satisfied with my visit to 
the United States. President Clinton, the leadership of the 
U.S. Congress, and I came to complete mutual understanding 
regarding various aspects of politics on the agenda of our 
talks," Eduard Shevardnadze, head of the Georgian state, stated 
on Wednesday evening. In an exclusive interview with an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent he noted that, during the meetings with 
the U.S. leadership, "an atmosphere of solidarity with Georgia 
and support for its territorial integrity and democratic 
development prevailed." 
  E. Shevardnadze pointed out that he had spent a few hours at 
the U.S. Congress, persuading the legislators of the need to 
render urgent and effective economic assistance to Georgia. "In 
my opinion, during discussion of the aid package the legislators 
will remember my arguments and agree that the volume of 
assistance promised by the administration should be increased," 
he said. "At the present time a critical situation has taken 
shape in Georgia; the country is on the brink of famine. We 
need Western assistance, both financial and technical, as never 
before." 
  As regards a settlement of the Abkhazian-Georgian conflict, 
the Georgian leader noted that he had completely devoted the 
last day of his visit to meetings at the United Nations. "I 
submitted several variants for a peace settlement to the 
Security Council," he said. "My speech was received with 
understanding and approval. At the present time the detailed 
drafts submitted by us for ways of achieving peace are being 
examined by the UN secretary general, who should make a final 
decision in the immediate future. This was a very important day 
for us. Owing to the fact that numerous talks were scheduled at 
the headquarters of the international community, we had to make 
adjustments to the program of the visit and postpone meetings 
with business circles, although they are also important for us." 
  The head of the Georgian state spoke out in favor of "global 
de-Bosnia-ization [debosniizatsii] of all the regional conflicts 
in the 20th century." He called upon the United States and 
other developed states in the world to promote this process. 
"In many cases not only national hatred, separatism, extremism, 
but also blatant elements of fascism manifest themselves," he 
pointed out. "We cannot allow the shoots of fascism to grow and 
allow extremism to triumph." 
  Dzhaba Ioseliani, chairman of the temporary committee of 
Georgia for emergency situations, reported in a conversation 
with the ITAR-TASS correspondent that "the president and the 
entire delegation were really satisfied with the results of the 
visit to Washington, but the talks that took place at the United 
Nations showed that not everyone in the international community 
is on the side of Georgia." "Some people think that we are 
extremists," he pointed out. "I think that the U.S. 
Administration and the UN leadership will come to share the view 
that there is an acute need to send peacekeeping forces to the 
region. I think, however, that this contingent will be 
negligible. It will probably consist of servicemen mainly from 
the European countries and naturally from Russia, although the 
U.S. side will try to see that the Russian `blue berets' are 
involved as little as possible. The Americans themselves are 
refusing to send their lads to us." 
  As the ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from informed 
sources, 
on the last day of his stay in Washington E. Shevardnadze held a 
meeting with CIA Director James Woolsey, at the latter's 
request, "with just a few people present." According to Petr 
Chkheidze, during the talks ways were discussed of effecting 
joint activity in the field of combating the illegal 
transportation of narcotics to the United States. Both the 
sides, he noted, had agreed on joint efforts to put an end to 
this criminal activity.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladislav Drobkov: "UN Troops in Caucasus? </F>
During U.S. Visit Shevardnadze Persuades Clinton of Need for 
International Military Presence in Georgia"] 
  [Text] Washington, 8 Mar -- U.S. observers believe the 
main result of the Georgian Supreme Council chairman's current 
talks in the U.S. capital is the accord between Eduard 
Shevardnadze and Bill Clinton regarding the advisability of 
sending UN international forces to Georgia. 
  Admittedly, the U.S. President hinted at the same time that 
Tbilisi must not count on U.S. troops being sent under the UN 
flag. Other countries must provide men and officers for 
"peacekeeping" in Georgia. While Washington will only be ready 
to provide moral and material support for this action, the White 
House promised. 
  Having won the support of the U.S. Administration the day 
before [7 March], Shevardnadze left Washington for New York 
Tuesday in order to persuade the United Nations to send troops 
to Georgia. The main purpose of this action, Georgia's 
representatives say, is to ensure the return home of around 
300,000 refugees from Abkhazia. 
  THE WASHINGTON POST cited Shevardnadze as saying that 
international armed forces will have to be brought into Abkhazia 
"to ensure the refugees' peaceful return." "It will be very 
hard to envisage a settlement to the conflict...without the 
crucial participation of the United States," he said during a 
conversation with the editors of THE WASHINGTON POST. In the 
newspaper's opinion, the Clinton administration is "trying to 
limit Russian involvement in all the former Soviet republics." 
"What we want to do is to ensure Georgia's territorial 
integrity," a White House spokesman said. 
  Meanwhile news of Clinton's support for this action has 
elicited conflicting comment and reactions in the U.S. capital 
itself. On the one hand, both the administration and Congress 
are not now averse to showing Russia that Moscow's doctrine of 
"nearby foreign countries" and Russia's peacekeeping role in the 
former Soviet republics by no means suit everyone here. On the 
other, the United States is afraid of the adverse consequences 
of, albeit indirect, involvement in the intricate conflicts amid 
the ruins of the USSR. Until recently people here were 
categorically opposed to sending UN troops (never mind U.S. 
soldiers) to the "new independent states" in the grip of 
conflict or to conferring the status of UN peacekeeping forces 
on Russian units and subunits performing peacekeeping missions 
there. 
  Even now the U.S. Congress is not united on this problem. 
Congressmen are particularly worried by the fact that Russian 
troops will inevitably form a considerable proportion of the UN 
contingent in Georgia. The United States and the United Nations 
would thus, as it were, be giving their blessing to Russian 
peacekeeping efforts in "neighboring foreign countries." And 
there are too many opponents of that prospect here now. 
  But people are also unhappy that Russian troops are already 
in Georgia. And they want to "balance" their presence by 
sending the UN troops for which Shevardnadze is now asking. An 
anonymous "ranking administration representative" said that UN 
forces would not under any circumstances be "Russian troops 
wearing blue helmets." 
  In order to give greater weight to his appeals, the Georgian 
leader took every opportunity to scare the Americans with the 
idea of the revival of Russian nationalism. With his customary 
enthusiasm Shevardnadze described the increase in 
ultranationalist forces in Russia as a "great threat not only to 
Russia but also to the whole world" during a press conference in 
Washington. Speaking about events in Russia, he also declared 
that "every honest citizen of the world" fears the revival of 
the "cold war." 
  Shevardnadze did not confine himself to appeals for UN 
troops 
to be sent to Georgia and laid the foundations for the 
development of military cooperation with the United States. He 
signed a joint statement on this with U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Perry at the Pentagon Tuesday. This envisages the two 
countries' opening military missions and carrying out a 
"military cooperation program" which includes U.S. aid and

personal guard.

  [Text] Georgian envoy to the European Union, Zurab 
Abashidze reported that on 8 March the council of the European 
Union made a decision to start negotiations with Georgia on 
preparing a comprehensive agreement on cooperation. This 
agreement is viewed as the first stage towards getting close 
with the central and eastern European states and the European 
Union and further integration with them. The Baltic states have 
already signed a similar agreement with the European Union and 
negotiations are being held with Russia, Ukraine, and Moldova. 
Thus, Georgia is the first Caucasian state with which the 
European Union decided to negotiate about the agreement. 
  The next stage of the European integration is getting a 
status of an associate member, which has been granted to a 
number of the former socialist countries in Europe: Poland, 
Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. The agreement on 
cooperation will create a legal basis for developing 
comprehensive relations with the 12 member states of the 
European Union and envisages a number of practical privileges in 
the sphere of political contacts, economic links, and trade.

  [Text] Baku, March 9 (TURAN)--Informed sources from the 
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs told TURAN that a meeting of 
the heads of the governments of Azerbaijan and Armenia and the 
representatives of the Armenian Community in Nagorno-Karabakh is 
expected to take place during the second half of March in Moscow. 
  The meeting will provide a concrete step towards the 
adoption 
of a peace settlement plan of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. 
  According to the plan, after a ceasefire and withdrawal of 
troops from both front lines, the Armenian troops must free all 
occupied territories outside of Upper [Nagorno] Karabakh, except 
Lachinskiy district. Following that, direct talks must commence 
between Baku and Khankendi (Stepanakert) over the status of 
Upper Karabakh. 
  It has been suggested to Azerbaijan that a treaty be signed 
with Upper Karabakh that would give the status of autonomous 
republic to the region with Azerbaijan. In addition, the 
creation of a demilitarized zone around Upper Karabakh has also 
been suggested. This plan also provides for the maintenance of 
the Lachin corridor as a means of communication between Armenia 
and Upper Karabakh. 
  The fate of Shushinskiy district of Upper Karabakh and the 
question about the Azeri population returning has not come up in 
the settlement proposal. These questions are to be discussed at 
a later date. It has been conveyed that Moscow is pushing for a 
quick implementation of the plan. 
  TURAN news agency was informed that this plan was discussed 
in the meeting between the Deputy of Foreign Affairs of Russia, 
Anatoliy Adamishin, and the Speaker of the Azerbaijani 
Parliament, Rasul Guliyev. Russia's envoy Vladimir Kazimirov 
and Russia's Ambassador to Azerbaijan, Valter Shoniya, also took 
part in the meeting.

  [Text] An extensive meeting was held at the Supreme Soviet 
today under the chairmanship of Rasul Guliyev, speaker of the 
parliament. 
  Our correspondent Gulsefa Ahmedova reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Ahmedova] The situation on the fronts and 
in the Army and measures to end the more than five-year war were 
discussed at a meeting that was devoted to the 
military-political situation in the Republic and problems 
connected with the creation of the army. 
  Rasul Guliyev informed the meeting that, despite contacts at 
various levels to put an end to the Armenian aggression, the 
opposing side is doing everything to prevent the resolution of 
the conflict by peaceful means. No matter what the difficulties 
are, the Azerbaijani people will shape their own destiny. Only 
we ourselves should solve all our problems. 
  [Guliyev] The future and destiny of Azerbaijan rests solely 
in the hands of the people. No one, be they our close neighbors 
or countries friendly to us elsewhere, will solve the 
Azerbaijani people's problems. For that reason, we must have a 
strong army, internal unity, and economic potential. We must 
also deal decisive and courageous blows against the enemy. Such 
blows will bring peace closer. The opposing side will opt for 
peace only when faced with force. 
  [Ahmedova] The chairman of the Supreme Soviet also informed 
the meeting that Babken Ararktsyan, chairman of the Armenian 
parliament, phoned him and expressed his wish for a meeting. It 
is highly possible that this meeting could take place on 
Saturday. 
  Prime Minister Suret Guseynov and heads of main departments 
at various ministries were taking part in the meeting. 
  The meeting is continuing behind closed doors. [end

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Russia is Active Again] </F>
  [Text] Russia has recently made a strenuous effort to 
regain its influence. Moscow's representatives in the UN 
Security Council and the CSCE have proposed several times that 
Russia be regarded as the only peacekeeping force in the former 
Soviet Union's territory. However, although the international 
community has adopted a cautious approach, Russia's leaders 
continue to insist on that view. It will be recalled that 
several international meetings and symposiums have rejected that 
idea. 
  Russia's military units have been deployed in Georgia with 
the consent of that Republic's leaders. They have been assigned 
to end the dispute between Abkhaziya and Georgia and establish 
peace. However, it is common knowledge that they do not [words 
indistinct] 
  Meanwhile, Russia's interest in Azerbaijan is gradually 
increasing. That country's media organs claimed some time ago 
that Russia wishes to establish a base in Azerbaijan but Baku 
has failed to approve Moscow's proposal on the matter. The 
media organs also claimed that Russia's troops will be deployed 
in Karabakh. That, too, was a wrong report. It is common 
knowledge that Azerbaijan's leaders are categorically opposed to 
the deployment of Russia's troops in Karabakh. President Aliyev 
and several other officials believe that the deployment of 
Russia's forces may prolong the peaceful settlement of the 
dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan and obstruct the 
withdrawal of the Armenian armed groups from our republic's 
occupied territories. In view of that, Baku is opposed to that 
idea. 
  Ambassador Vladimir Kazimirov, President Boris Yeltsin's 
special envoy, arrived in our region a few days ago. He was 
accompanied by Deputy Defense Minister G. Kondratyev. 
Undoubtedly, their arrival was linked to Russia's deployment of 
its peacekeeping forces in Karabakh. Baku outlined its position 
and noted that the deployment of Russia's troops on the border 
between Armenia and Azerbaijan would be more appropriate. 
Azerbaijan's residential areas would not be fired on from 
Armenia and the Republic's people would find an opportunity to 
live in peace and attend to their daily work. 
  Russia made a new proposal for the peaceful solution of the 
dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan in February. A 
cease-fire agreement was reached, which would be put into effect 
on 1 March. Undoubtedly, that was welcomed. Naturally, Russia 
could have used that agreement to strengthen its influence. 
Unfortunately, however, we wish to note that the cease-fire 
agreement was short-lived. The Armenian side violated it, as it 
has done so several times in the past. Meanwhile, Moscow was 
expected to warn Yerevan to force it to remain committed to the 
agreement. 
  It is common knowledge that Russia was eager to participate 
in the effort made to end the dispute in Bosnia. In fact, it 
has achieved its objective to a certain degree. Moscow wished 
to use the experience it gained in Bosnia in Azerbaijan. 
  Meanwhile, it will be recalled that Baku has disclosed 
several times that it supports the peaceful solution of the 
dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Furthermore, it has 
confirmed its approach through the steps it has taken thus far. 
Nevertheless, Azerbaijan's leaders call for the liberation of 
all the occupied territories and the removal of all the Armenian 
armed groups from our Republic. It is only then that Azerbaijan 
can hold talks for the solution of the problem. Moscow is 
well-aware of Baku's position. It will be recalled that Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev supported Azerbaijan's draft plan and 
described it as a constructive document that is acceptable to 
all the sides concerned. 
  However, it seems that Russia is unable to relinquish its 
ambitions. Moscow must comply with international agreements and 
law. That is how it can regain its influence.

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement from Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign </F>
Affairs; place and date not given--read by announcer] 
  [Text] In accordance with Russia's invitation, President 
Geydar Aliyev dispatched his representative to Moscow on 2 March 
to hold talks on the peaceful solution of the dispute between 
Armenia and Azerbaijan through the Russian Federation's 
mediation. However, Armenia's representatives and those of the 
Armenian community in Azerbaijan's Daghlyk [Nagorno] Karabakh 
region failed to arrive in Moscow. As such, they undermined yet 
another effort Russia made to mediate to end the combat 
operations in the region. 
  The Armenian side's behavior has indicated that the Armenian 
leaders' claims that Azerbaijan does not maintain a practical 
approach to the peace proposals made by Russia within the CSCE 
framework and that Azerbaijan expects [words indistinct] are 
baseless. 
  On 3 March the Armenian Armed Forces violated the agreement 
reached by the sides to the dispute, which was included in the 
protocol the Azerbaijan, Armenian, and Russian defense ministers 
signed in Moscow on 18 February. The Armenian military units 
launched a wide-scale attack in Azerbaijan's Fizulinskiy Rayon 
and intensely pounded Azerbaijan's rayons on Armenia's border 
with rockets and artillery guns. 
  [Words indistinct] and many peaceful people have been killed 
as a result of Armenia's armed aggression against Azerbaijan 
during the past six years. 
  The latest incidents have taken place when a CSCE delegation 
headed by Minsk Group Chairman Jan Eliasson was in the region. 
The Armenian side has demonstrated once again that it does not 
wish to comply with the political methods required to end the 
dispute, heed the norms and stipulations of international law, 
and fulfill the responsibilities it has shouldered in accordance 
with the UN Security Council resolutions and the protocol that 
was recently signed, which called for the withdrawal of the 
occupationist forces from Azerbaijan's territory. 
  Reaffirming Azerbaijani support for ending the dispute 
through political talks, the Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs holds Armenia's leaders fully responsible for the 
violation of the cease- fire agreement and the latest upsurge of 
military operations in the region.

  [Text] Sources in the Russian Foreign Ministry told 
Interfax that First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin 
had succeeded in persuading the Tajik opposition leaders to hold 
talks with Tajik authorities. The first round of talks is 
expected to be held in Moscow some time after March 16 with 
Russian mediation under the aegis of the UN. 
  A senior Russian diplomat, who had accompanied Adamishin, 
said that Moscow appreciated "the positive mood" of the Tajik 
opposition. "The venue of the talks proved to be the sole 
problem; We proposed Moscow. Tajik opposition agreed to hold 
only the first round of talks here which was to be followed by 
meetings in Tehran, Iran or Islamabad, Pakistan. We did not 
object because we thought that the most important thing was to 
have the negotiation process started," the diplomat said. 
  He added that the Tajik opposition leaders had emphasized 
the 
special role played by Russia, notably as the guarantor of 
Tajikistan's independence. 
  According to the diplomat, Russia will do its best for the 
success of the talks while not being a party to them. 
  Adamishin met with a Tajik opposition delegation headed by 
Khoji Akbar Turajonzoda who acted on behalf of Abdullah Nuri, 
leader of the Islamic Revival Movement. Other delegation 
members were Mukhammad Sharif Khimmadzoda, a leader of the 
Islamic Revival Party; Atakhon Latifi, a leader of the 
Democratic Party; Abdu Nabi Sattorov, a member of the Democratic 
Force Movement ruling body; Sabib Sangipov, chairman of the Fund 
of Aid to Tajik Refugees and Displaced Persons in CIS Member 
Nations, Bozorali Safarov, former Tajik transport minister and 
Khudoberdy Kholiknazarov, former foreign minister.

<F P=106> [Report by Oleg Panfilov: "Representatives of Authorities </F>
and Opposition To Meet in Moscow Unless There Is a Power Change 
in the Republic"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] One member of the Tajik 
opposition, Khodzhi Akbar Turadzhonzoda, former head of the 
republic's Spiritual Administration of Muslims, former People's 
Deputy and member of the presidium of Tajikistan Supreme Soviet, 
gave NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA a brief telephone interview. 
  [Turadzhonzoda] We are grateful to Russian diplomats for 
their efforts in preparing talks. I think that Russia has 
realized its responsibility and its place in regional policy. 
We have always been and remain advocates of close and friendly 
relations with Russia. We are together with democrats of 
Russia, together with those who campaign for the observance of 
human rights and the rights of nations to self-determination. 
We are especially pleased at the visit of Anatoliy Adamishin, 
with whom we have struck understanding on many questions. 
Distressing is the position of the Russian military, which does 
not want a peaceful resolution of the conflict; this is attested 
to by the threats of punitive operations against residents of 
the Garm group of rayons and against refugees in Afghanistan. 
  [Panfilov] What conditions do you set for holding talks in 
Moscow? 
  [Turadzhonzoda] First and foremost are guarantees of 
security for participants in the talks, as well as for their 
relations who are on the territory of Tajikistan and in CIS 
countries. The ruling out of all pressure on the negotiating 
process from whichever side. Especially, the cutting short of 
attempts to scuttle the talks on the part of the joint command 
of the military contingent stationed in Tajikistan, as well as 
holding no exercises in the "Tigrovaya Balka" nature preserve, 
and actions against residents of the Garm group of rayons and 
refugees in Afghanistan. [interview ends] 
  In line with the agreement, taking part in the talks will be 
six persons on each side -- the opposition and the present 
authorities in Tajikistan. It is so far unknown whether Khodzhi 
Akbar Turadzhonzoda and, from the opposition, Mukhammadsharif 
Khimmatozoda, chairman of the Islamic Party of Revival, will 
come along. The others will be from the so-called moderate 
opposition. The government group's composition is still unknown.

<F P=106> [Report by Journalist Arkadiy Dubnov incorporating telephone </F>
interview with Haji Akhbar Turajonzoda, former head of Tajik 
Muslims, in Tehran; date of interview not given: "Tajik 
Opposition Reaches Mutual Understanding With Russian Diplomats 
But Not With Russian Military"] 
  [Text] The Tehran meetings between Tajik opposition 
leaders and Anatoliy Adamishin, Russian first deputy foreign 
minister, were successful. 
  The first round of talks between the Tajik Government and 
the 
opposition will take place in Moscow. The subsequent rounds are 
due to be held in Iran and Afghanistan in order to give due 
credit to the efforts of these countries, which have assisted 
national reconciliation in Tajikistan. In addition, their 
observers, like observers from Russia, Pakistan, and the United 
Nations, are due to attend the talks themselves. The leader of 
the Tajik opposition delegation will be Haji Akhbar Turajonzoda, 
former head of the Tajik Muslims. 
  On behalf of the Russian leadership Adamishin guaranteed the 
delegation members' complete safety during their stay in Moscow. 
But opposition leaders are concerned for the safety of their 
families living in Tajikistan, especially bearing in mind that 
they themselves have been declared state criminals by the 
Dushanbe authorities. 
  The interlocutors agreed that for the duration of the talks 
a 
moratorium must be imposed on hostilities both on the 
Tajik-Afghan border and inside Tajikistan. 
  But the plans of the command of the CIS coalition 
peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan to hold military exercises in 
the near future on the territory of the unique "Tiger Gully" 
nature reserve and to carry out deterrent actions against the 
population of the Garm group of districts in the republic are 
being seen by the opposition as an attempt to wreck the talks. 
  I contacted former spiritual leader Turajonzoda by telephone 
in Tehran and asked him a few questions. 
  [Dubnov] We know about your statement that you do not aspire 
to political power in Tajikistan and that the new transitional 
coalition leadership must include professionals untainted by 
participation in the armed struggle of Tajiks among themselves. 
Can you see such people in the current Tajik leadership? 
  [Turajonzoda] I have no doubt that there are now such decent 
people in the Tajik Government. This question was not discussed 
in the meetings with Mr. Adamishin. 
  [Dubnov] Will you be able to guarantee control over 
opposition gunmen in order to observe the truce for the duration 
of the talks? 
  [Turajonzoda] I can give an absolute guarantee. This is 
where we differ from the Dushanbe regime, which even now is 
incapable of coping with its own armed formations in 
Kurgan-Tyube Oblast. 
  [Dubnov] How do you assess the role of Russian diplomats and 
military personnel in the Tajik-Tajik truce? 
  [Turajonzoda] We are very grateful to the Russian Foreign 
Ministry for the meeting held in Tehran. We were ready for it 
even during the last eight months. Russia has finally 
recognized its own interests and its historical place in the 
region, and we fully recognize its geopolitical importance here. 
Friendly relations with democratic Russia, where human rights 
and ethnic minorities' rights are respected, are entirely in our 
interests. 
  As regards the Russian military, we very much regret that 
some of them are not interested in a peaceful solution to the 
Tajik problem and are even trying to sow discord among 
opposition forces in Tajikistan. In doing so they are possibly 
pursuing their own aims. Mr. Adamishin also recognized in 
conversations with us that military personnel in Tajikistan 
often exceed their functions, and confirmed instances of their 
interference in the intra-Tajik conflict. 
  [Dubnov] How soon can the Tajik-Tajik talks take place? 
  [Turajonzoda] That must be determined by the UN secretary 
general's special representative; we are ready to begin them at 
any time.

  [Text] There are various rumors circulating in the republic 
alleging that the opposition forces would start riots in 
Dushanbe and other towns and rayons of the republic on 13, 15, 
or 21 March, and the armed groups of the opposition would 
organize armed incursion on the Tajik-Afghan border. 
  The Tajik Security Ministry, Internal Affairs Ministry, and 
Defense Ministry state with full responsibility that these 
rumors are groundless and the republic's social and political 
situation is under full control. The situation on the 
Tajik-Afghan border is under control as well. The border is 
safely controlled by Russian border troops in Tajikistan. The 
border units of the Tajik Army, Russian servicemen of the 201st 
motorized rifle division, as well as the units of the CIS 
coalition peacekeeping forces render all-round assistance to the 
Russian border troops. 
  There is no doubt that Tajikistan's border and territory 
will 
be protected from any kind of invasions. The ministries firmly 
state that in the republic and on its borders there are no 
forces able to violate the peace and tranquillity of Tajik 
citizens.

<F P=106> [From the "Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F>
Ministry] 
  [Text] The situation on the Tajik-Afghan border remains 
complex. Over the holiday a number of provocations were carried 
out against the Russian border guards and the subunits of the 
CIS collective peacekeeping forces. Here is a characterization 
of the situation on the border with Afghanistan and in 
Tajikistan as a whole by Colonel General Boris Pyankov, 
commander of the collective peacekeeping forces. 
  [Begin Pyankov recording] Unfortunately there has been a 
sharp intensification of the confrontation between the regions, 
and there is an attempt to employ strong-arm methods. More and 
more often there are very brutal terrorist acts. People are 
being killed for different reasons. 
  Regions are in conflict, and various forces are in conflict 
within the regions themselves. At the same time we sense that 
there has been a sharp increase in the pressure on the 
Tajik-Afghan border and on the border guards above all from the 
Afghan side. For the time being, of course, the weather 
conditions have been a restraining factor. It is mountainous 
terrain, and everything is still covered with snow. The passes 
are closed, and paths are difficult to traverse. In these 
conditions, however, violations or attempts to violate the 
border are occurring almost daily. The situation is 
particularly grave in the Pyandzh border detachment's strip, 
where border violations and attempts to break through are 
occurring almost daily. The situation is complex too in the 
Sarygor area, where the well-known 12th and 13th border posts 
are located. 
  Unfortunately new symptoms have appeared. Whereas previously 
we had been noting cases of attempts to cross the border by 
relatively small groups, bands, and detachments armed with small 
firearms, we now have cases of border posts, the positions of 
peacekeeping force subunits, and Tajik populated localities 
being bombarded by mortars and artillery from Afghan territory. 
[end recording] 
  The command of the peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan thinks 
that the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border may have further 
deteriorated by mid-March. According to the military, a 
considerable number of specially trained Tajik opposition 
fighters have already amassed in the Afghan border areas. Many 
of these detachments are equipped with Stinger portable 
anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, and mortars.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 46 (536): </F>
Reports by Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitry Voskoboynikov, Igor 
Porshnev, Vitaly Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] As Interfax has learned from a credible source, 
copies of a plan to drastically change the republic's policy 
have been sent to parliament and government. The plan was 
drafted by independent centers for political intiative with a 
group of leading political scientists and economists taking part. 
  According to the draft, "if documents on the integration of 
the monetary systems of Belarus and Russia are not signed by mid 
March through the Russian leadership's fault", Belarus will 
immediately start building up its frontier with Russia, will 
introduce a national currency (by available information, money 
bills were printed in Germany long ago and are currently stocked 
in the republic - IF), and will impose heavy custom duties on 
all Russian commodities transported across Belarus. 
  However, the key points of the program are those that 
presuppose "energetic steps to be taken by Belarus to set up an 
alliance of Baltic and Black Sea States". Such an alliance 
would unite Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, and a number of East 
European countries and would possibly be maintained by NATO as a 
"buffer" between Russia and Western Europe. 
  The plan provides for closer ties between Belarus and NATO 
up 
to a revision by the country of its proclaimed neutrality and a 
withdrawal of all the Russian troops deployed in Belarus by the 
end of this year. 
  Besides, the draft envisages dismantling the key Russian 
strategic facilities at Vileika and Gantsevich at an early date. 
By military experts estimates, the dismantlement would do more 
than 150 Tn [Trillion]-rubles-worth damage to Russia and would 
disorganize the management of sveral Russian fleets, the 
nuclear-submarine fleet included. 
  The Belarusian Prime Minister's Spokesman Vladimir Zametalin 
has neither confirmed nor denied the existence of such a 
program. He told Interfax that "Russia's unjustified stalling 
with signing the documents on the formation of a monetary union 
for improper reasons make the Belarusian leadership weary and 
compels it to plan steps in advance."

  [Text] Stanislav Bogdankevich, the chairman of the National 
Bank of Belarus, has said that the new terms being put forward 
by the Russian side for the unification of the two countries' 
monetary systems are unacceptable. This primarily concerns a 
return to clearing, the elimination of the National Bank of 
Belarus and, as a consequence, the direct refinancing of 
Belarusian banks by the Central Bank of Russia and Central Bank 
provision of loans to the Belarus Government. 
  Speaking at a news conference, Bogdankevich stressed that 
not 
one of these points -- as well as a number of others -- was in 
the agreement signed between Belarus and Russia on 5 September 
1993. 
  Given this turn of events, the chairman of the National Bank 
believes that it is essential for politicians to invite in the 
experts to work out a joint decision, since private meetings 
between the two premiers are unproductive. After every such 
meeting, the demands of Russian experts become increasingly 
tough. If, however, the Russian side is ready to return to the 
already agreed position, then Belarus will not delay in joining 
the single ruble zone, Bogdankevich stated.

  [Text] A military and technical concept for developing 
weapons and military equipment until the year 2000, as well as a 
state armaments program, have been discussed at a meeting of the 
Defense Ministry Collegium. Participants in the meeting stated 
that the second stage in scaling down and restructuring the 
Belarusian Army was completed in 1992 to 1993, which brought the 
size of the Belarusian Armed Forces down to nearly the levels 
specified by international agreements. Again noted were 
difficulties with recruiting enough troops, caused by the 
specific demographic situation in Belarus, the Chernobyl 
aftermath, and the anti-Army campaign launched by some media.

<F P=106> [Cristian Nita report from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] The prosecutor of the Republic of Moldova, Dumitru 
Postovan, has taken steps to have Ilie Ilascu, who was elected 
deputy to the Parliament of Moldova, released. Immediately 
after Ilie Ilascu was elected as a deputy, I officially 
intervened with Sergey Leontiev, chief of the Grigoriopol 
executive, where the prison is located, Mr. Postovan told the 
BASAPRESS agency. 
  According to the same source, the prosecutor of the Republic 
of Moldova specified that, although in his intervention he 
mentioned the responsibility for violating Ilascu's status as a 
deputy, one cannot count on a serious answer, because only on 
the basis of special authority granted by parliament can one 
conduct negotiations with the anti-constitutional bodies in 
Tiraspol. 
  BASAPRESS points out that the president of the 
self-proclaimed Dniester republic, Igor Smirnov, said a few days 
before the 27 February elections that the Tiraspol authorities 
will not recognize Ilie Ilascu's parliamentary immunity. 
  The Central Electoral Commission is working on the last 
specifications regarding the final results of the 27 February 
elections, a commission spokesman told BASAPRESS today. 
According to legal provisions, within 24 hours the final 
results will be submitted to the Constitutional Court, which, in 
turn, will confirm the legality of the elections within 10 days. 
  The duties of the Central Electoral Commission will expire 
after the validation of deputies' mandates and the setting up of 
the new parliament. 
  Also in connection with the 27 February elections, the 
electoral Bloc of the Socialist Party and the Edinstvo Unity 
Movement declared that it has a lot of information regarding 
numerous violations of the law during the elections. 
  According to the (?INFOTAG) news agency, this electoral bloc 
submitted a notification to the Supreme Justice Court, which 
stresses that all these violations have essentially distorted 
the ballot results to the detriment of the Bloc of the Socialist 
Party and the Edinstvo Unity Movement. 
  Notifications to this effect were also submitted to the 
Central Electoral Commission, as well as to the justice bodies 
in all the districts of Chisinau, the INFOTAG news agency 
specifies. 
  By the middle of the current month, a representative 
invested 
with the full power of the president of the Russian Federation 
is expected to arrive in Chisinau to coordinate the measures of 
settling the conflict in the eastern rayons of the Republic of 
Moldova, the INFOTAG news agency reports. 
  According to the same source, the ambassador in charge of 
special missions, Vladimir Vasev, will be President Yeltsin's 
representative in the Republic of Moldova. 
  Political observers view Vladimir Vasev's arrival as a 
positive reaction to the results of the recent parliamentary 
elections in the Republic of Moldova, INFOTAG emphasizes.

<F P=106> [Svetlana Gamova report: "Moldova: Idea of Unification </F>
With Romania Rejected Once and for All"] 
  [Text] Chisinau -- A national sociological poll conducted 
6 March has confirmed the results of the parliamentary 
elections: 90 percent of the citizens who took part in the poll 
expressed support for independence, territorial integrity, and 
the unity of state borders. 
  The poll will probably put an end to debates centered not 
only on the degree to which unification with Romania is sensible 
and historically justified, but also on what to actually call 
the people. Victory for the Agrarians in the parliamentary 
elections and the attendant insurance for the "Counsel with the 
People" policy being conducted by them have clarified this 
question: The state bears the name Moldova, Moldovans live in 
it, and they speak Moldovan. It seems that the epithet 
"Romanian," having dominated all spheres of republic life in 
recent years, is on the way out. The Agrarians also promise to 
review the national anthem, which is identical to that of 
Romania. What is Romania's reaction to this unexpected turn of 
events in Moldova? A group of eminent representatives from the 
Moldovan intelligentsia sent a protest to the United Nations 
assessing the negative backlash on the part of the Romanian 
press and certain political movements as interference in 
Moldova's domestic affairs. 
  Using the results of the poll, the parliamentary majority 
will doubtless push a decision on the status of the southern and 
eastern regions through the legislative body even before a new 
constitution is adopted. 
  But although a draft law on the Gagauz question has already 
been agreed, dialogue with the Dniester Region has yet to begin, 
and it will not be easy. The Tiraspol authorities are 
interpreting the majority of that region's inhabitants' 
non-participation in the elections to the Moldovan parliament, 
and subsequently in the national poll too, as a declaration of 
the region's own statehood. However, the hope was expressed in 
the Dniester Region that with the victory of the Agrarian 
Democratic Party relations between Chisinau and Tiraspol will 
alter radically, and Moldova will "embark on a constructive 
path." 
  The first session of the new parliament is expected to 
ratify 
the agreements on the CIS. 
  With the defeat of the idea of unification with Romania, a 
number of ministers are expected to leave, first and foremost 
the ministers of culture and education, and the head of the 
languages department. The most extreme activists of the 
People's Front are represented in the leadership of these 
departments.

sociological poll "What People Advise" in the Republic of 
Moldova, 75.1 percent of the citizens who have the right to vote 
had cast their vote in the poll. 
  Our Chisinau correspondent Cristian Nita reports that, out 
of 
the total respondents, 95.4 percent gave an affirmative answer 
to the question on the voting card, 2 percent gave a negative 
answer, and 2.6 percent of cards were not valid. 
  The President of the Republic of Moldova Mircea Snegur 
stated 
after the results had been announced that in this way an end is 
put to all speculations that have been circulated so far and 
stressed that the Republic of Moldova has one single future, 
that of an independent, united, and indivisible state.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksander Lebed, commander in chief of the </F>
14th Russian Army, by Rostislav Khotin and Dmitriy Mosiyenko in 
Tiraspol; date not given: "Not Long Ago We Were Citizens of One 
State, Therefore We Can Gain an Understanding More Quickly and 
Easily Than Any Americans, Germans, and Englishmen..."] 
  [Text] General Lebed, 43, is one of the most prominent 
stars on the military horizon of the former Soviet Union. A 
regular officer with 25 years of experience and an Afghan War 
veteran, he consolidated his position and influence both in 
Moldova and Moscow during the armed conflict between Kishinev 
and Tiraspol in 1992. This is why he can take the liberty of 
making judgments that do not become military officials, and 
particularly commanders of foreign troops... People have 
different opinions about General Lebed, ranging from a boorish 
soldier to a man capable of replacing Pavel Grachev. General 
Lebed gave an interview on the eve of legislative elections in 
Moldova at the 14th Russian Army Headquarters in Tiraspol, 
sitting under the Russian flag and a large poster depicting the 
Kremlin. We preserved the general's style of speech throughout 
the interview. 
  [KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI] Comrade commander, Moldovan President 
Mircea Snegur said he would press for the complete withdrawal of 
Russian troops from Moldova in 1994... 
  [Lebed] I got you. As they say, desires do not always match 
abilities. When I am asked whether it is good when the Army of 
one state is on the territory of another state, I answer "no." 
Should it be pulled out? Yes, it should. 
  When it should be pulled out is a separate question. This 
should be done when all political and economic conditions for 
the pullout are in place; when, for example, one can get a 
sufficient number of trains here and then dispatch them to new 
stationing sites so that local women do not assault our units, 
as was the case before... Those conditions are not yet met! Why 
not? Just because a year and a half of peace brought no 
results; negotiations are in a deadlock with no progress in 
sight. As for economic conditions, Shevardnadze from Georgia 
babbled much about them -- hundreds of thousands of officers are 
left without jobs, apartments, and any prospects for the future. 
This kind of withdrawal is even more unacceptable. There is 
also a diplomatic side to the whole problem. What would Ukraine 
say, if I started to transport weapons and ammunition through 
its territory? After all, its railroads will be jammed with 
dangerous cargo. There is a technical side to this problem. 
Considering the railroads and loading sites available and the 
huge amount of weapons, this transportation would require two 
solid years of around-the-clock work -- day and night, and no 
holidays... So, who can ever talk here about the summer of 
1994? Besides, you cannot utilize the ammunition here. They 
would not listen to any arguments, and only go like, Get out of 
here and period. I think it is an election campaign ploy. 
  [KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI] Some politicians -- in particular, 
Brigitte Schultz who is the leader of a NATO group observing 
elections in Moldova -- believe that the presence of the 14th 
Russian Army in the Dniester region will complicate Russia's 
participation in the "Partnership for Peace." 
  [Lebed] Brigitte Schultz is no authority to me. Besides, 
women should move their butts out of this place, and not stick 
their noses into the dog's turd. She is threatening us? Let 
her come down here and try to pull this Army out. The former 
Soviet Army withdrew from Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, 
Germany, Mongolia, and Cuba. This was the first wave, and then 
the second one followed. The withdrawal of the Western Group of 
Troops is to be completed by 1 September, and the Northwestern 
Group of Troops is now being withdrawn from the Baltics. All 
this crush of officers, warrant officers, military equipment, 
and wild homeless officers... With a severe economic crisis 
crippling Russia and Ukraine, this problem will not be solved 
quickly. And it must be solved in a civilized manner. When the 
British Rhein Army had to be pulled out from Germany two years 
ago, the British estimated that this would require nine years. 
Germans checked it out and agreed. This is what I call a 
civilized approach. 
  [KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI] Who could replace the 14th Army in 
the future? UN peacekeeping forces, maybe? 
  [Lebed] Let us take it for granted that not long ago, we 
were citizens of one state, therefore we can come to terms more 
quickly and easily than any Americans, Germans, or Englishmen. 
Take, for example, the trilateral peacekeeping posts of 
Russians, Dniester Russians, and Moldovans. If they want to get 
smashed, they do it together, so there are no ethnic problems 
among them. Their commanders know each other, too, because they 
used to serve in the same army. 
  A steady balance of forces has been established in this 
region. If you drastically disturb it... For example, suppose 
there is no 14th Army as of tomorrow. This will immediately 
instigate a temptation to solve long-standing problems in one 
fell swoop. Someone will have to fill the vacuum. No action, 
however tough and swift, can be victorious. That is a tough 
place around here -- everyone would always owe something to 
everyone. European borders were drawn and redrawn after 
numerous wars. Here, you can prove that white is either white 
or black, depending on how old your map is. This is why this 
place can become another Yugoslavia. Personally, I don't see any 
possibility as to how to pull my Army out of this region. Even 
if someone new comes tomorrow to lead it, he would not see, 
either. 
  The humiliatingly short record time for withdrawal from 
foreign countries often brought about a problem of, say, how to 
dissolve a division in two months. Servicemen were asked then 
where they came from. Are you guys from Tiraspol? Come to the 
14th Army commander, he will find you a place. As a result, 51 
percent of officers and 79 percent of warrant officers in my 
Army come from this region. This is one whole jumble -- the 
Army is Russian, its commander's last name is Lebed, his combat 
deputy is Melnychuk, and his logistic deputy is Perepadya. All 
of them have numerous relatives in nearby Ukraine. Generally 
speaking, this is paranoia that needs to be blown away as soon 
as possible. Ukrainians, Russians, Belarusians are all Slavs 
with one fate, blood, and faith. We should think of what unites 
us, and not the other way around. What we are doing right now 
is separating them as Siamese twins that have two heads and one 
body. If separated, both of them will be nothing but hideous 
freaks. So, we are working now on the freaks. 
  [KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI] What are the relations between the 
14th 
Army command and the Dniester leadership? 
  [Lebed] Relations with the Dniester Republic of Moldova 
[PRM] 
have never been cloudless. They introduced some dumb money and 
meddled in someone else's business by sending some hundred 
soldiers to the White House in October. They bring in some 
citizenship and pass weird laws, privatizing the 30-km-stretch 
of the Russian gas pipe line in the region. They took under 
their jurisdiction the air space over their republic without 
even having an airport and planes. I refused to be a PRM deputy 
because I am against the boorish interference with affairs of 
the state that I serve. It is up to Russia what president and 
parliament to elect. No Swedes, Czechs, or Dniester residents 
have the right to decide this.

  [Text] In an interview with foreign reporters, Ukrainian 
Navy Commander Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy has stated that our state 
is no longer considering the possibility of transferring to 
Russia the Ukrainian share of Black Sea Fleet ships as payment 
of the debt for oil and gas. The Navy commander said that the 
protocol signed in Massandra was a protocol of intentions. This 
has never been a solution. According to Volodymyr 
Bezkorovaynyy, this issue has been studied and rejected. The 
transfer to Russia of our share of the fleet is no longer 
discussed. Instead of this, the commander added, the two sides 
agreed to set up a committee for compiling an inventory of ships 
and other fleet property for their further division in 
accordance with earlier agreements between the presidents of the 
two states. Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy believes that the fleet 
should be divided equally by the end of 1995.

  [Text] Moscow March 9 TASS -- Ukraine has remitted seven 
million dollars to the current account of the Russian "Gazprom" 
enterprise on Wednesday [9 March] to repay part of its debt for 
gas supplies, said Vladimir Podmarkov, chief engineer of 
"Gasprom" central dispatcher department, in an interview with 
ITAR-TASS. 
  Podmarkov said that this amount is incompatible with the 
total amount of debt exceeding a trillion roubles by now, but 
shows that Ukrainian consumers make efforts to repay their debts. 
  Options for the full repayment of Ukraine's debt will be 
discussed on Thursday with Ukrainian representatives, Podmarkov 
said. The Ukrainian delegation which will negotiate the issue 
is expected to arrive late on Wednesday.

  [Text] On 9 March, the Ukraine Defense Ministry press 
service came forward with a denial of a statement made by 
Anatoliy Lupynis, leader of the Ukrainian National Assembly. A. 
Lupynis alleged that Ukraine's military agency had prepared, for 
the talks between L. Kravchuk and B. Yeltsin, a draft document 
on the creation on Ukrainian territory of military bases where 
Russian Federation laws are to be in force. The denial says 
that A. Lupynis' statement has nothing in common with reality 
because "such a thing contravenes Ukraine's current legislation, 
and therefore even a supposition that the military agency was 
preparing or considering the possibility of such drafts is 
groundless." The Defense Ministry press service explains the 
appearance of Lupynis' statement by the acute election struggle, 
where "some political leaders are trying to increase their 
political capital by compromising the Armed Forces."

  [Text] Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov 
declined to confirm reports that a second train loaded with 
nuclear munitions had left Ukraine for Russia on March 9. 
  "Information of this kind is extremely confidential as 
shipping such freights entails necessary security measures," he 
told Interfax-Ukraine. 
  "It would be desirable if people handling these processes on 
both sides did not create tense situations in future," Shmarov 
said. He added that "professionals did their best to ensure the 
security of the shipment and make sure the freight arrives at 
its destination by the shortest possible route." 
  Ukraine has not received nuclear fuel from Russia as 
envisioned in the trilateral statement by the U.S., Ukrainian 
and Russian presidents. The only thing the Ukrainian leadership 
received was a telegram from Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin stating that the Russian government would start the 
supplies before the end of this month.

  [Text] Russia's noted economist Evgeniy Saburov has charged 
the former Crimean government with inaction, with trying to 
bring about an economic crisis in the Crimea and with trying to 
discredit its President Yuriy Meshkov. Saburov, who had 
accepted Meshkov's offer to lead the Crimean government, made 
this statement in an interview with Interfax upon his return to 
Moscow from the Crimea, where he had stayed from February 22 
through March 5. 
  In his words, astounded by Meshkov's election to the 
presidency, Crimea's ex-premier and his deputies "have 
deliberately wrapped up all their affairs despite the need to 
organize the spring sowing campaign, prepare for the summer 
holiday season and resolve many urgent problems." 
  "Thus, displeased with the popular vote in Meshkov's favour, 
the former Crimean leadership was ready to doom the Crimeans to 
hunger and cold which is nothing but political wickedness," 
Saburov declared. 
  At the same time, he pointed to Meshkov's growing popularity 
among Crimean industrialists, "whose initial reaction to his 
election was cautious." 
  Saburov underscored the danger of trying to make the Crimea 
submit to Ukraine by force. In his words, demands to resume 
ties with Russia are not nationalist by nature, yet they are 
essential since "Crimea's economy is oriented towards Russia 
rather than Ukraine," and the rupture of ties with Russia would 
be a disaster for Crimea. 
  In Saburov's opinion, "with all the contradiction" in the 
law 
on the delimitation of powers between Ukraine and Crimea, "it is 
lucrative to Kiev, Simferopol, and Moscow alike." "If Kiev 
refrains from mounting barriers deliberately, he remarked, the 
Crimea could play the role of a bridge between Ukraine, Russia, 
and other former USSR republics." 
  He gave assurance that in forming a Crimean cabinet he would 
rely on knowledgeable economists and responsible executives. 
"The selection process will be tough," he declared. 
  Saburov noted that "a good understanding and interaction" 
had 
emerged between him and Meshkov. Speaking about the current 
situation in the Crimea, he said that the democrats there were 
trying to build a smooth democratic market economy." 
  "Inside the Crimea, there are tough problems, but the 
problem 
of the Crimea is nonexistent," Saburov declared. In his view, 
the Crimea is a trump card for outside politicians. "I least of 
all mean Kiev," he added. 
  According to the Crimean Constitution, the president is 
simultaneously the head of the republic's cabinet, and his 
deputy and other cabinet members are appointed by parliament, 
  So far there has been no official decree on the appointment 
of Saburov to the post of deputy premier.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has no information as to 
the whereabouts and plans of ex-President Richard Nixon who came 
to the Russian capital for a visit. 
  As a high-ranking American diplomat told INTERFAX, the 
embassy does not monitor private visits. The ex-president came 
to Russia in a purely personal capacity. He has no contacts 
with the embassy; he has not informed it of his movements or 
further plans, the diplomat said. 
  As INTERFAX learned from the travel agency Connect servicing 
Nixon's visit, the ex-president will stay in Moscow till about 
March 16th. 
  According to a member of the agency directly concerned with 
the high-ranking guest, his arrival in Moscow is in no way 
connected with Big Politics or business. Richard Nixon simply 
likes to visit Russia, meet with Russian people and to see the 
changes in the country. His present trip to Moscow is neither 
the first nor the last, he said. 
  The North-American Department of Russia's Foreign Ministry 
told INTERFAX that the ministry has nothing to do with Nixon's 
visit to Moscow. 
  "The Russian Foreign Ministry would have monitored the 
ex-president's visit, had the American embassy been in charge of 
it" a high-ranking Russian diplomat told INTERFAX's 
correspondent. 
  According to him, the visit is of "a purely scientific 
nature". "Nixon's ties with the Carnegie Foundation and with the 
Fund for Democracy are well known. Evidently the former 
American president is on a visit in Moscow in connection with 
these organizations," he said. 
  Another Russian diplomat interviewed by Interfax's 
correspondent has a different point of view. "As a retired 
politician Nixon may allow himself what officials from the 
Clinton Administration cannot afford. He has already conferred 
with the Communist leader, Gennadiy Zyuganov, and with the 
former Vice-President, Aleksandr Rutskoy. Nixon makes no secret 
of his intention to meet with the Liberal Democratic Party 
leader, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. All this reflects a striving to 
"sound out the situation," if not "build bridges," and to 
clarify what the Russian opposition is like, and whether it is 
capable of coming to power eventually," he said.

  [Text] Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian President's press 
secretary, believes a rather inappropriately emotional situation 
has developed in connection with certain meetings that former 
U.S. President Richard Nixon had in Moscow. In his today's 
statement Kostikov says hasty conclusions are being drawn out of 
a private incident, conclusions that affect the essence of the 
U.S.-Russian relations. 
  As the press secretary noted, there can be no question of 
preventing foreign visitors' contacts with opposition leaders. 
It is in the Russian Government's interest that the full 
picture of political life in Russia is known abroad. It was 
expected that Richard Nixon, a well-known supporter of 
democratic transformations in Russia, will use his visit to 
Moscow with such an aim in mind. However, the ex-president's 
meeting with Aleksandr Rutskoy created a certain context that 
touched upon the complicated political moments in Russia's 
internal affairs, the press secretary believes. According to 
Kostikov, considerable part of the Russian public see Aleksandr 
Rutskoy as one of the main organizers of the October revolt and 
a serious threat to democracy and civil accord. 
  As regards to relations between Moscow and Washington, Boris 
Yeltsin has repeatedly stated the importance of developing 
friendly, partner-like ties with the United States, the 
statement says.

  [Text] Former U.S. President Richard Nixon considers Boris 
Yeltsin's reaction to his meetings with Russian opposition 
leaders as an "unfortunate misunderstanding," according to 
Nixon's advisor, Dmitri Simes, who is accompanying him during 
his visit to Russia. Simes made this statement at a news 
conference in Moscow Wednesday [9 March]. 
  "We did not know that permission is needed to hold meetings 
in a democratic country, taking into account the fact-finding 
character of the visit," Simes said. 
  As has already been reported, Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin 
said this afternoon that neither he, nor his chief of staff, 
Sergey Filatov, would meet with Nixon. A scheduled meeting 
between the ex-President and Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin was also not held. 
  "This was even more strange as we have received confirmation 
for the meeting more than once," Simes was quoted as saying. 
  Simes believes that Yeltsin's reaction was provoked by 
distorted information he had been given about Nixon's meetings 
with some prominent figures of the Russian opposition such as 
the leader of the Communist faction in the State Duma, Gennadiy 
Zyuganov, and ex-Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy. 
  Simes said the meeting with Rutskoy could not be planned 
beforehand as Rutskoy was kept in custody until recently. 
  According to Simes, the goal of the ex-President's visit was 
to familiarize himself with "political forces which have weight 
in Russia and report his findings to the Congress, 
administration and the American public." 
  Simes put a special emphasis on the "private and 
fact-finding 
character" of Nixon's visit to Moscow. At the same time, he 
said that Nixon had a telephone conversation with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton on March 3. He said that Clinton supported the 
idea of the visit and hoped that Nixon would make an 
unprejudiced report on the state of affairs in Russia to his 
administration. 
  According to Simes, Nixon will have to amend his schedule of 
meetings in Moscow. "Under the current circumstances," a number 
of meetings with "many high-ranking members of the Russian 
leadership" who had said they were ready to meet with the 
ex-President would be impossible. 
  At the same time, Simes did not rule out that Nixon could 
meet with the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. 
  Simes said many Russian government officials took part in 
the 
organization of Nixon's visit. The official invitation for 
Nixon to visit Russia was signed by Security Council Secretary 
Oleg Lobov.

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Slavin: "Nixon's Sounding Out"] </F>
  [Text] Former U.S. President Richard Nixon has met with 
opposition leaders Aleksandr Rutskoy and Gennadiy Zyuganov. In 
his opinion these meetings are "a positive sign," evidence of 
the strength and not the weakness of the Russian Government. 
Although these meetings were unofficial, competent sources 
assert that U.S. President Bill Clinton knew of them, just as he 
knew of the planned meeting with V. Zhirinovskiy. 
  Nixon's talk with A. Rutskoy took place at the general's 
home. Despite the fact that it lasted about two hours, almost 
nothing is known about it. Rutskoy is keeping it completely 
confidential. Just one thing is clear: The talk was conducted 
around a discussion of the situation in Russia and the 
opposition's place and role in society. Considering that this 
is the third meeting between its participants, the talk was 
quite frank and serious, obviously touching on many personal 
aspects of Russia's present and future leadership. 
  So far A. Rutskoy is obviously keeping quiet about the 
prospects of his future political activity. But I am sure that 
this silence will end soon and we shall again see Aleksandr 
Rutskoy as a major figure on the political Olympus. 
  As for Richard Nixon's meeting with Gennadiy Zyuganov, 
leader 
of the Russian Federation Communist Party, here there was far 
more information. The meeting took place in the State Duma. 
According to the evidence of the Russian Federation Communist 
Party Central Executive Committee press service, there was an 
involved talk about the domestic political and economic 
situation in Russia, ways of getting it out of the crisis, and 
the prospects of Russian-U.S. relations. Gennadiy Zyuganov 
spoke unambiguously of the perniciousness of the shock therapy 
course and the possibility of a social eruption if it is 
continued. 
  As G. Zyuganov put it, the Russian Federation Communist 
Party 
will not accept either right or left radicalism and is prepared 
to cooperate with all political forces which advocate the 
resurrection of a strong Russia. The resurrection of a renewed 
Union, in his opinion, is only a matter of time. Gennadiy 
Zyuganov told Richard Nixon about the Russian Federation 
Communist Party's extensive contacts with the communist parties 
of former union republics and countries of remote foreign parts. 
The Russian Federation Communist Party press service reports 
that Gennadiy Zyuganov stated the party's readiness to cooperate 
with representatives of all religions and to promote the 
resurrection of spirituality and thousand-year-old Russian 
traditions. As for cooperation with representatives of various 
religions, the Communists have never rejected it, but that does 
not mean renouncing atheism. 
  In his talk with R. Nixon G. Zyuganov expressed the concern 
of all Russia's patriots at the United States' unvarying course 
connected with unconsidered support for the executive power 
unpopular with the people. It is interesting to note that 
Zyuganov's denunciation of the policy of the penetration of 
Western mass culture, the cult of violence, and pornography in 
the mass media met with Richard Nixon's understanding. 
  Summing up the results of his meeting with the opposition 
leaders, Richard Nixon told journalists that he is inspired by 
the fact that the opposition leaders do not want to change the 
situation in the country with the aid of force.
