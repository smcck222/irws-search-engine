<F P=106> [Communist Party of the Russian Federation Central Executive </F>
Committee press service report: "G. Zyuganov Has Met With R. 
Nixon"] 
  [Text] Gennadiy Zyuganov, chairman of the Communist Party 
of the Russian Federation [CPRF] Central Executive Committee and 
leader of the communist faction in the Federal Assembly State 
Duma, received former U.S. President Richard Nixon 8 March. An 
engaged discussion took place between them about Russia's 
internal political and economic situation and the prospects for 
Russia's development and for the development of Russian-U.S. 
relations. Having congratulated G. Zyuganov on the CPRF's 
success in the Russian Federation Federal Assembly elections, R. 
Nixon asked the leader of Russia's most popular party about his 
views on ways of extricating the country from the crisis, his 
assessment of the ruling regime's domestic and foreign policies, 
the CPRF's international ties, and its attitude to religion. 
  The CPRF chairman unequivocally stated that the policy of 
so-called shock therapy is destructive for Russia and fraught 
with the possibility of social outbursts with unpredictable 
consequences for the whole world. At the same time, he noted 
that the Russian Communist Party will accept neither right-wing 
nor left-wing radicalism and is ready to cooperate with all 
political forces which stand for the revival of a strong Russia 
as a guarantor of peace and security throughout the world. "The 
reconstitution of a renewed Union, in which none of its peoples 
would have their sovereignty infringed, is only a matter of 
time," G. Zyuganov emphasized. The first stage in achieving 
this goal, he said, is to renew all ties between Russia and 
Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. The whole world will benefit 
from stability and calm being restored to this area, occupying 
one-sixth of the globe and packed with nuclear warheads. 
  G. Zyuganov told R. Nixon about the permanent contacts 
between the CPRF and former union republics' communist parties 
and its international ties with more than 100 communist, 
socialist, social democratic, and other left-wing parties of the 
Old and New World. 
  G. Zyuganov also noted that the CPRF and the whole of the 
Russian patriotic movement are uneasy about the one-dimensional 
nature of the U.S. approach to the political forces in Russia 
and the growth of anti-American sentiment in Russian society in 
connection with Washington's reckless support for the current 
executive, which is unpopular among the people; but they greet 
with enthusiasm the recently observed trend whereby the U.S. 
leadership is trying to gain a deeper understanding of the real 
situation in Russia. We have an interest, he said, in mutually 
advantageous cooperation on an equal basis between Russia and 
the United States, but on the condition that there is respect 
for the culture and spiritual values of the Russian people and 
the other peoples of Russia.

  [Text] Russia has a special place in the world, and other 
countries should pay heed to its stance. This is what Grigoriy 
Yavlinskiy, leader of the State Duma's "Yabloko" faction, said 
during his meeting with Richard Nixon, former U.S. president, in 
Moscow. Yavlinskiy attributed that not only to Russia's nuclear 
potential, but also to its geopolitical situation. The 
"Yabloko" leader also spelled out to Richard Nixon his vision of 
the problems facing economic and political reform in Russia, 
Western assistance, and the Russian Federation's place in world 
politics.

<F P=106> [Yelena Ovcharenko and Vasiliy Ustyuzhanin commentary under </F>
the "Our Commentary" rubric: "Nixon Persona Non Grata to 
Kremlin"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The Russian Federation 
president said that "Nixon has met with Rutskoy and Zyuganov but 
the most interesting thing was that he had come to meet with 
me." After this, Boris Yeltsin noted, "I will not meet with 
Nixon, and neither the government nor Filatov will receive him." 
[passage omitted] 
  Let us try to examine what is happening through the eyes of 
Moscow officials. Were the amendments which Viktor Chernomyrdin 
and the Russian Federation president himself caused to be made 
to Nixon's program evidence of nascent "Great Russian pride"? 
Maybe, we have become more discriminating and will not now 
simply rush off and welcome with open arms both overt and covert 
emissaries from the across the ocean? There is no disputing 
that not all politicians like sharing the stage with 
Zhirinovskiy and his crew. 
  But in that case we are still showing the same political 
clumsiness through which we are constantly causing blunders in 
our relations with the United States. We have clearly chosen 
the wrong time and place to show our dissatisfaction. The 
opposition is something sacred in a democracy, and it would be 
bad form to snub some well-known person on a well-known mission 
-- unorthodox though it may be to us -- for the sole reason that 
Washington has woken up to the fact that it had gotten a 
fixation with its favorite political figures and has decided to 
broaden its official appointments book.

  [Text] State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin described the talks 
held in the U.S. by Russia's parliamentary delegation as very 
successful. 
  He told INTERFAX that "from the very beginning both sides 
had 
succeeded in overcoming the cooling of relations, caused by the 
recent spy scandal, and that the Americans had agreed that the 
new Russia could not be responsible for everything that had 
taken place in the past." 
  To quote Rybkin, the leaders of the State Duma committees 
for 
international affairs, defense, budget and economic policies had 
established good contacts with colleagues in the U.S. Congress. 
  He also announced that at the end of March or at the 
beginning of April Democratic and Republican leaders in the 
Senate, George Mitchell and Robert Dole, would arrive in Moscow 
on the State Duma's invitation. At the end of the current year 
or at the beginning of 1995 Speaker of the U.S. Congress's House 
of Representatives Thomas Foley is likely to visit Moscow, he 
said. 
  Rybkin stated that cooperation with the U.S. was Russia's 
absolute priority, because the two countries cannot live without 
one another in the present-day world. "We also assured our 
American colleagues that we would promote the reforms which are 
absolutely irreversible," he said 
  On Wednesday afternoon, the Russian deputies are to meet 
with 
President Bill Clinton and Vice President Albert Gore, after 
which the State Duma delegation will leave for Moscow.

  [Text] Washington March 10 TASS -- The Russian 
parliamentary delegation led by parliament speaker Ivan Rybkin 
had meetings with U.S. President Bill Clinton and Vice-President 
Albert Gore at the White House on Wednesday [9 March]. 
  Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the committee on international 
affairs of the State Duma (lower house of the Russian 
parliament), told ITAR-TASS about the meetings. 
  The meeting with the U.S. President was a short one, Lukin 
noted. The president welcomed the delegation and promised to do 
his best to help develop relations between the U.S. Congress and 
the Duma. 
  The meeting with the vice-president was more detailed, Lukin 
continued. Gore praised the first steps by the Duma and its 
chairman to create a climate for coordinated legislative work 
and for national reconciliation. 
  The sides discussed a wide range of econonmic relations 
between the two countries. "Describing positively the work of 
the intergovernment Russian-American commission co-chaired by 
Gore and Viktor Chernomyrdin, we pointed, at the same time, to 
several pressing economic problems," the committee chairman said. 
  Russian legislators stressed that America would make the 
best 
contribution to Russian reforms not by counselling but by 
opening its markets, at least for several years, for Russian 
goods. 
  "The vice-president agreed, in principle, with our position, 
noting that the U.S. Administration is now working on this 
issue," Lukin added. 
  The sides also discussed urgent politial questions. The 
vice-president noted that Americans sometimes painfully react to 
some events in Russia, regarding them as manifestations of 
nationalism and imperial aspirations. According to Gore, the 
point in question is some aspects of the Russian policy towards 
former Soviet republics. 
  Lukin said that the Russian lawmakers assured Gore that such 
worries are groundless, since Russia is more preoccupied not 
with conquering anybody but with ensuring basic human rights for 
all people living in those republics. 
  According to the committee chairman, legislators told the 
vice-president that Russia does not intend to be a superpower, 
challenging America everywhere in the world, since "we have many 
mutual interests". 
  However, delegation members told Gore that Russia does not 
want to be a satellite or a second-rate power and that it has 
its own interests. The vice-president agreed with this point, 
admitting that, indeed, some people display excessive 
nervousness over unimportant issues and that it is necessary to 
work calmly, looking for common interests.

  [Text] Washington March 10 TASS -- Russian speaker Ivan 
Rybkin believes that the State Duma (lower chamber of the 
Russian parliament) is the major reformer in the country and 
that it is impossible to promote reforms without civil accord. 
  "I regard the Duma as the most reforming arm of government 
in 
Russia," the speaker said. "It includes three-quarters of the 
former government. Many came to it from the Russian president's 
office and occupy key positions in parliament," he continued. 
  "If you look at parliamentary groups, many of them changed 
their names. They were joined by bankers, businessmen, lawyers 
and farmers. 
  "Therefore, when we start adopting basic laws which will 
clear up roadblocks in the way of reforms, it will be easier for 
us than for the former parliament. However, we should 
understand: we shall not advance further without civil accord 
and cooperation between the executive and legislative arms of 
government. 
  "Therefore, we even do not think about a rollback and 
reversal of reforms," said Rybkin at a news conference on 
Wednesday on the results of his parliamentary delegation's visit 
to Washington. 
  "Intervals in relations between the legislatures of such big 
countries as the United States and Russia are inadmissible, and 
our visit to Washington has shown that this conviction is shared 
by Russian and U.S. parliamentarians," he added. 
  "We also discussed the importance of cooperation between the 
leaders of executive and legislative powers in the United States 
and Russia as well as judicial authorities, since it is 
necessary to have a constant contact in the present 
kaleidoscopically changing world. 
  "In the near future, U.S. Congress delegations will visit 
Russia, and the inter-government commission co-chaired by Albert 
Gore and Viktor Chernomyrdin will hold a very important 
meeting," the speaker noted. 
  "The U.S.-Russian constant is partnership and cooperation 
for 
the sake of peace and accord on earth, for the sake of difficult 
reforms in Russia. 
  "We agreed on many problems, mapped out cooperation 
programmes and decided that mutual information should be 
complete and frank to prevent misunderstandings in relations, 
which arise due to the lack of reliable information."

  [Text] Washington, 9 Mar -- Tuesday [9 March] was a busy 
and intense day on Capitol Hill for the Russian State Duma 
delegation which is visiting the U.S. capital at the invitation 
of the U.S. Congress. The Russian parliamentarians, headed by 
Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma, held meetings and talks 
with the leaders of the Senate, George Mitchell and Robert Dole, 
and with Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar. They visited the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, whose chairman is Claiborne 
Pell. The speaker of the House of Representatives, Thomas 
Foley, gave an official luncheon in honor of the Russian 
delegation. 
  ITAR-TASS correspondents asked a member of the delegation, 
Vladimir Lukin, who is chairman of the Duma's international 
affairs committee and a former Russian ambassador to the United 
States, to comment on yesterday's talks, which were held behind 
closed doors. He said that a wide range of issues, including 
both international problems and the state of our economy and 
budget, were discussed. There was especially great interest in 
the economic situation in Russia at the meeting with the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee. A thorough discussion on Bosnia 
took place. We agreed to coordinate our actions better within 
the framework of partnership, i.e. coordinating our steps first, 
then acting, rather than the other way round. On the whole the 
talks were constructive, there was no suggestion of 
confrontation, irritation and so on. We have now reached the 
stage of mature partnership, we have moved on from the days when 
we agreed in advance to what anyone told us. This fact 
naturally creates some nervousness here. 
  In addition to the meetings in Congress, the State Duma 
delegation also visited the Pentagon, where it was received by 
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry. Bearing in mind that the 
delegation was invited by Congress, wasn't this merely a 
courtesy call, the ITAR-TASS correspondents asked. No, replied 
V. Lukin. We were met by a solid team and there were solid 
talks about problems which concern them - ratification of 
fundamental treaties, including START-2, accession to the 
convention on chemical weapons, and open skies. 
  The ITAR-TASS correspondents asked how united was the 
position of the Russian parliamentary delegation, given its lack 
of political homogeneity. V. Lukin said that in his view there 
are really only two groupings in the Duma. One is geared to 
constructive and professional work on ending the crisis and to 
cooperation with all branches of power. The other is interested 
in chaos. Our delegation, he stressed, was made up entirely of 
representatives of the first grouping, and the shades of 
difference between us were secondary. Our prime motivation was 
to show our American partners that we hail from a single state, 
that we are Russian patriots and that we are upholding our 
country's interests, rather than settling internal scores. 
  The talks and meetings were also attended by Sergey Glazyev, 
Sergey Yushenkov, Mikhail Zadornov and Galina Klimantova, who 
are all chairmen of State Duma committees.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] Asked by INTERFAX on Wednesday [9 March], whether he 
will receive ex U.S. President Nixon, now in Moscow, Russia's 
President Yeltsin toughly declared: "No". He added: "Neither 
the government nor Filatov (the presidential administration 
chief -- IF) will receive him." 
  "After the meetings that Nixon has had here, this is 
impossible, and I am glad that U.S. President Clinton shares 
this view. One should not behave as he pleases in Russia. 
Russia is a Great country," said Yeltsin. 
  During his current stay in Moscow, Nixon met with a number 
of 
officials, among them Russia's former president Alexander 
Rutskoy, just released from Lefortovo jail, the Communist Party 
leader Gennadiy Zyuganov, the cabinet member and leader of the 
Russian Unity and Concord Party's faction in Duma Sergey 
Shakhray, and the leader of another parliamentary faction 
Grigoriy Yavlinskiy. 
  At the same time, Yeltsin stressed that we will do all we 
can so that what has been gained through Russo-American 
cooperation should not be lost. This is a very useful plus, and 
our goal is that at a meeting of the chiefs of the two countries 
foreign policy departments in Vladivostok (to be held on March 
14 - IF), new opportunities will be explored to promote this 
cooperation." 
  On the Ames scandal in U.S., Yeltsin said: "Well, it is the 
intelligence service's business. This is a natural state of 
relations between any countries, but this cannot be crucial to 
Russo-American relations." 
  Yeltsin answered an INTERFAX reporter's question at a 
wreath-laying ceremony near Gagarin's burial site by the Kremlin 
wall. The ceremony was held to mark the sixtith birthday of the 
world's first cosmonaut.

  [Text] Samara March 9 TASS -- A group of Russian officers 
of the Volga Military District's 27th Motorized Infantry 
Division returned from the German town of Wurzburg, the 
headquarters of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Division. The Russian 
officers had discussed with their American colleagues details of 
joint manoeuvres of U.S. and Russian peacekeeping forces 
scheduled for this coming summer. 
  The military exercises will aim to practice coordinated 
actions in zones of possible inter-ethnic conflicts. The 
peacekeepers are to disengage "the warring sides", disarm them, 
organize observance and patrolling. Also planned are operations 
for delivering humanitarian aid, protection of "refugee 
makeshift camps" and some other actions. The peacekeepers will 
be confronted with complicated tasks difficult to practice in 
densely-populated western countries. For this reason, the 
manoeuvres will be carried out near the village of Totskoye in 
the Orenburg region, the place of the 27th Division's location. 
  U.S. soldiers will be carried here by their planes and with 
all their military equipment. General Leonard Holder, commander 
of the 3rd Infantry Division, has already visited the village 
and examined the site of the upcoming military exercises. The 
guests measured the runway at the local air-field and took 
samples of local air fuel, petrol and lubricants to check out 
whether they can be used for filling American vehicles. 
  The U.S. peacekeepers are going to bring about 70 various 
wheel vehicles, including armoured combat vehicles and trucks, 
as well as ammunition and foodstuffs. The Russian side will 
provide engineer support, fuel, partly foodstuffs and bedding. 
  American "blue helmets" also requested help from Russian 
pilots, since they need helicopters for the manoeuvres. 
  Living conditions in the village of Totskoye, situated 
amidst 
bare steppes, can hardly be regarded as easy. The exercises are 
scheduled for the hottest summer month, July. But the 
commanders of the 3rd U.S. Division assert that their soldiers 
are accustomed to any conditions. They participated in the 
operation "Desert Storm" and in the Korean war. And still 
earlier, the division fought the Nazi Germany. It has been 
awarded with 38 orders and medals. 
  The Russian peacekeepers also have much to its credit. The 
27th Guards Motorized Infantry Omsk-Novobug Division named after 
Bogdan Khmelnitsky was formed in 1918. It took part in the 
Finnish war and World War II, storming Berlin. Then it was part 
of the Western Army Group. After withdrawing from Germany in 
1991, it was deployed in Totskoye. Now the division is 
practicing peacekeeping operations.

difficult to achieve must not be allowed to weaken; its content 
must be specified on the basis of a complete equality of rights 
and obligations and the partnership must acquire a mature and 
strategic outlook. It is in this tone that Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev is preparing to hold an open dialogue 
with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Vladivostok. 
  The Russian minister stated this today while opening a 
session of the Foreign Policy Council in Moscow, devoted, in

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F>
Boris Krivoshey] 
  [Text] Moscow March 10 TASS -- Russia is set to prevent any 
weakening of partnership established with the United States, 
specify its substance on the basis of full equality of rights 
and duties, give it maturity and strategic orientation in talks 
with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher on March 14 in 
Vladivostok, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said here 
today. 
  He announced this in his opening address at the meeting of 
the Council for Foreign Policy, which is due to consider 
problems of European security, relations with NATO and other 
international structures. 
  Kozyrev said it is necessary to begin joint efforts to form 
strategic partnership in building a new Europe. "President 
Yeltsin has put forth this initiative, which is now being 
considered by the leaders of Western countries". 
  According to the minister, the international community needs 
an effective mechanism of coordinating actions relating to the 
most important international problems. He praised the positive 
changes which have taken place in the movement towards new 
stability in Europe, including joint military exercises, 
exchanges of visits along the military line and interaction in 
the field of conversion. 
  He said a practical headway has been made towards making 
former enemies see friends in each other and allies in the 
perspective. The idea of cooperation with NATO has been given 
substance in the U.S. concept of Partnership for Peace, which 
opened a period of drafting and implementing programmes which 
involve all interested countries on an equal basis. 
  Russia is close to signing the relevant documents, Kozyrev 
said. 
  Along with this Kozyrev noted that "the NATO mania of 
impatient advocates of joining the alliance, and the partnership 
executed to the accompaniment of an anti-Russian hysteria can 
lead to the strengthening of the position of (ultra-nationalist) 
Zhirinovskiy and his supporters," Kozyrev warned. 
  Kozyrev said that Partnership for Peace upheld by NATO is 
pattern of military and political cooperation which cannot 
replace a wide-scale strategic interaction along all lines 
oriented towards a perspective. There is no point in 
overstressing the military-political aspects or contrasting them 
to the key task of strengthening democracy and human rights in 
all of Europe as a guarantee of its peaceful future. 
  Kozyrev rejected attempts of certain circles in the West, 
central and eastern Europe to "speculate on the Zhirinovskiy 
factor and revive the image of an enemy in the face of Russia". 
Those who insist on the thesis of Russian menace begin to 
believe it themselves. The artificially generated threat makes 
people blind and prevents them from seeing the real problems of 
security. 
  "The victory in the cold war was not won by the NATO 
military 
machine but by the democratic principles of the Conference for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe. It is the CSCE which is 
bound to win a stable democratic peace in conditions of a 
post-confrontational Europe", Kozyrev said.

<F P=106> [Reports by diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, </F>
Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others; from the 
"Diplomatic Panorama" feature] 
  [Text] The agreement reached between Bosnian Croats and 
Muslims to form a federation and subsequently establish a 
confederation with Croatia leaves no one, including Serbs, 
aside, said the Prime Minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Haris 
Silajdzic, after talks with the head of Russian diplomacy on 
Wednesday, in answer to a question from Interfax. 
  According to Silajdzic, "reassuring trends" emerged lately 
in 
many directions of a settlement in Bosnia. He said he hopes 
that the Russian peace-keeping forces stationed in the area of 
Bosnia's capital will continue to play a positive role and "help 
Sarajevo become a symbol of peaceful coexistence between the 
various ethnic groups on Bosnian territory". 
  The prime minister also noted "the extremely constructive 
role played by the Russian government, particularly by Foreign 
Minister Kozyrev and the special envoy of the Russian president, 
Vitaliy Churkin, in the efforts to reach a settlement in 
Bosnia." "I hope that in the future they will take an even 
better-balanced stand. This will only help the process of 
settlement." 
  The head of Russian diplomacy described his talks with 
Silajdzic as a "detailed and open exchange of views concerning 
the basic aspects of a settlement in Bosnia." 
  All the parties involved in the conflict are equally close 
to 
Russia, he stressed. "Russia is not only a Slavic nation, but 
also one of the world's biggest Muslim countries. We strongly 
oppose discriminatory approach to any of the conflicting sides," 
Kozyrev said.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Andjelko Perincic for Croatian </F>
Radio from Moscow] 
  [Text] Mate Granic, vice president of the government of 
the Republic of Croatia and minister for foreign affairs, met 
his counterpart Andrey Kozyrev in the Russian capital this 
afternoon. Following one hour of talks, the two ministers 
addressed the media. 
  Kozyrev stressed that his country was in agreement with 
other 
international factors in its belief that the recent positive 
climate surrounding the resolution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
crisis should be sustained. Minister Granic added that the 
agenda of their talks included the Washington agreement and the 
work of the expert commissions in Vienna. 
  He stressed that the negotiations ought to also include--in 
addition to the Croats and Muslims--the third side, without 
which it is impossible to reach a final solution either in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina or in the entire region. According to 
Granic, the interlocutors discussed the question of returning 
Croatia's occupied areas under the full jurisdiction of our 
state. 
  [Begin Granic recording] We regard the Russian Federation's 
role as positive. We also appreciate Kozyrev's personal role, 
as well as Mr. Churkin's, in these negotiations. We also expect 
that negotiations with the third side will resume the moment the 
present negotiations in Vienna are ended. [end record] 
  Replying to a number of questions raised by the media, 
Russian Minister Kozyrev reiterated that his country has always 
favored a global solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He also 
expressed satisfaction with the fact that--following his talks 
with Granic and earlier in talks with Bosnia-Herzegovina's Prime 
Minister Silajdzic, who is also staying in Moscow--he has 
received assurances that the Croatian-Muslim agreement is not to 
the detriment of the third side. 
  He also said that no one was officially questioning the 
internationally recognized borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
Croatia. The Russian minister noted that he had recently talked 
to Radovan Karadzic about how to save the integrity of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina under conditions of respect. It is the 
peoples of that country who must decide on its state territory, 
Kozyrev said. 
  Speaking about UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Forces] role, he 
added that Russia was in favor of continuing the mandate of the 
blue helmets in the conflict areas. This can only be in support 
of a political solution in the area of the former Yugoslavia. 
Minister Granic endorsed this view by saying that within the 
next few days Croatia would demand that the UN Security Council 
reinforce the mandate of the blue helmets. 
  Following his talks with Minister Kozyrev, Granic went to a 
working lunch with Russian President Boris Yeltsin's special 
envoy for the area of the former Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Good evening, dear viewers. Within 
his one-day visit to Moscow Mate Granic, the Croatian deputy 
prime minister and foreign affairs minister, had a meeting with 
his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev. Their talks related to 
all the important elements of the crisis on the territory of 
former Yugoslavia, particularly the Washington Agreement between 
the Croats and Muslims, and its results. Elizabeta Gojan 
reporting from Moscow. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Granic] We had talks on all important 
problems relating to the crisis on the territory of former 
Yugoslavia. We had talks on the Washington agreement, its 
results, the current phase of negotiations in Vienna, and the 
necessity to include the third party [Serbs] in the 
negotiations, because without the inclusion of the third party 
it is not possible to find a final solution for restoring peace 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and likewise to achieve a global solution 
to the crisis. We also had talks on UN Protected Areas in the 
Republic of Croatia and the need for their peaceful 
reintegration. [passage omitted] 
  [Granic] We particularly welcome the standpoint assumed by 
the Russian Federation regarding the territorial integrity of 
the Republic of Croatia and the need for the UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] mandate to secure in practice all that is laid 
down in the UN Security Council resolutions and to start serious 
negotiations with the local Serbs. 
  The Washington agreement is the first important one in the 
restoration of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, whose results can 
already be seen on the ground. However, it does not resolve 
everything. There is no final solution without the inclusion of 
the third side. An agreement which is to be reached between the 
federation and the third side will determine the content of the 
confederation. Therefore, all negotiations on the federation 
should be completed, which will then be followed by negotiations 
with the third party and the final definition of the content of 
the confederation. 
  As the United States played a very positive role in the 
convergence of views and in the final signing of the preliminary 
agreement, both in the present phase of the negotiations and... 
[pauses] As they have backed this agreement, the Russian 
Federation can likewise play an extremely positive role in 
influencing Serbia itself, and the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
but also in exercising influence on the Serbs in the UN 
Protected Areas [in Croatia]. 
  [Gojan] Have you been given some guarantees? 
  [Granic] Talks will in every case be continued. The exchange 
of views will also be continued. We have also agreed some 
further steps. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] To form a Muslim-Croat federation and subsequently 
establish a confederation between it and Croatia is a political, 
not legal, problem. It is not quite clear to Russia yet how 
this will be formulated from the legal point of view. The 
details will evidently be coordinated in the course of further 
negotiations, the special envoy of the Russian president, Deputy 
Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, told journalists in Moscow on 
Wednesday. 
  According to him, Russia continues to support the idea of 
Muslim-Croat integration. "It will be even better if an 
interesting legal form, capable of drawing a final solution to 
the problem nearer, is found," Churkin said. 
  In comments on the wish that the Russian leadership would 
"take a better-balanced stand" expressed by the Bosnian Prime 
Minister, Haris Silajdzic, Churkin said: "The very fact that all 
Bosnian sides complain from time to time that the stand taken by 
Russia is not balanced well enough points to its correctness and 
objectivity."

  [Text] Moscow March 9 TASS -- Italian Foreign Minister 
Beniamino Andreatta arrived in Moscow on Wednesday to discuss a 
wide range of topics with Russian leadership. 
  In a short interview with ITAR-TASS upon arrival at the 
airport, Andreatta said he had come to Russia in the capacity of 
chairman of the CSCE Council. 
  While in Moscow, the Italian diplomat is scheduled to meet 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev to consider prospects for cooperation in Europe and ways 
of settling conflicts in hotbeds of tensions -- in former 
Yugoslavia and the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave. 
  The talks will also deal with preparations for a high-level 
meeting of the Group-of-Seven (G-7) highly industrialized 
countries scheduled to be held in Naples this coming summer. 
  As compared with the previous forums of this kind, Russia 
will be a more active participant in the upcoming meeting. 
Thus, it will be paid more attention during the meeting itself 
and not only outside it, as it was usually done before. The 
most important problems facing the present-day world are to be 
discussed in the presence of the Russian president. 
  According to Andreatta, Italy as organiser of the Naples 
summit intends to see to it that these changes be reflected in 
the forum's final documents. All this is to help Russia become 
a G-7 full- fledged member and to pave the way for transforming 
such forums into G-8 meetings. 
  As chairman of the CSCE Council, the Italian minister will 
also exchange views with the Russian leadership on Russia's 
relations with the Baltic republics. Andreatta plans to discuss 
this issue in Tallinn and Vilnius as well, where he will be 
going after the Moscow talks.

  [Text] Moscow March 10 TASS -- "Very close friendly ties 
exist between Russia and Italy. I think the meeting with 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin which has just taken place has 
set a clear-cut friendly tone in relations and cooperation 
between Russia and Italy," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyev said today at his meeting with Italian Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Beniamino Andreatta. 
  Kozyrev greeted the Italian minister also as a 
representative 
of the Group of Seven industrialised countries and president of 
the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Kozyrev 
stressed that time was ripe for turning the seven into eight, at 
least in the political sphere. "It is difficult to imagine a 
situation where any important political problems could be now 
resolved without Russia's participation," Kozyrev said.

  [Text] Moscow March 9 TASS -- Ukraine does not intend to 
send another convoy with 60 nuclear warheads to Russia in the 
near future, contrary to some media reports, said a high-ranking 
official of the Russian Defence Ministry in an interview with 
ITAR-TASS on Wednesday [9 February]. 
  In particular, he pointed out that the removal of nuclear 
warheads from Ukraine to Russia for their subsequent dismantling 
and utilization is being carried out as scheduled and in 
accordance with a defence capacity of enterprises which will 
carry out processing. The expert said that during transportation 
and storage of nuclear warheads at enterprises serious attention 
is paid to ensuring their safety. At the same time, there is no 
point in closely watching the movement of each convoy since 
secrecy during the transportation and storage of nuclear 
warheads will be fully observed. 
  The first convoy with nuclear warheads from "Ukrainian 
missiles" is bound to arrive at its destination in the near 
future. The destination is not disclosed for reasons of 
secrecy, but it was announced that in accordance with tripartite 
Russo-American-U.S. agreements signed in Moscow on January 14, 
1994, the warheads will be dismantled for being subsequently 
processed at one of Russia's enterprises. 
  Under the agreement, in exchange for the warheads Russia has 
pledged to supply fuel to Ukrainian nuclear power stations, but 
not in the form of processed nuclear material obtained from 
withdrawn missiles. The processing of this nuclear material 
will take from several months to one year, experts said. The 
supplies of nuclear fuel to Ukrainian nuclear power stations 
will be carried out from Russia's fuel reserves. 
  According to the Russian Defence Ministry, on the Ukrainian 
territory there are about 1,300 warheads for intercontinental 
ballistic missiles an over 600 - for cruise land-based missiles. 
The condition of part of nuclear ammunition causes special 
concern of nuclear experts which might promote the speediest 
removal of nuclear ammunition from Ukraine.

"Nuclear Disarmament of Ukraine Gets Under Way. Russian Defense 
Ministry Expert Cautious in Forecasts"] 
  [Text] "A practical realization of the trilateral 
understanding on the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine, reached by 
the Presidents of the United States, Ukraine, and Russia in the 
Kremlin on 14 January, has begun," advised a high official in 
the Russian Federation Defense Ministry with the caution 
acquired through many months of negotiating. Without naming, 
for known reasons, the day the "operation" should begin, and 
very roughly (several months) defining the length of time for 
withdrawing nuclear warheads from Ukraine, the Defense Ministry 
general noted that the leaders of the three states had also 
specified the "equivalency" of exchange -- the minimal number 
(200) of warheads for 100 tonnes of uranium fuel for Ukraine's 
nuclear power engineering. The "transportation expenses" shall 
be absorbed in equal portion by both sides -- the transportation 
of the special cargo across the territory of Ukraine shall be 
paid for by Kiev, the next part of the journey by Moscow. No 
customs inspection has been envisioned (under the agreement 
between Ukraine and Russia on the withdrawal of strategic 
weapons of April 1992, the general said, transportation in a 
special category with a special cargo is not subject to customs 
inspection). The protection and security arrangements while the 
"cargo" is in transit, the specialist vouched, are guaranteed by 
a tough system of security that includes constant monitoring of 
progress, provision of all types of communications facilities, 
and a "cover" by competent organs along the train's route. 
  A participant in the Russo-Ukrainian talks, the Russian 
Defense Ministry expert is rather cautious about prognoses 
regarding the future of the nuclear disarmament process of the 
Ukrainian state which, he remarked, has not so far added its 
signature to the document on nonproliferation of nuclear weapons 
-- which in itself does not rule out debates inside Ukraine, in 
particular in its new parliament, on the question of Ukraine's 
possessing its own nuclear potential. The "neatness" with which 
the first stage of partial nuclear disarmament of the neighbors 
has gotten under way, the expert underlined, evokes the 
satisfaction of the Russian side.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Leskov of IZVESTIYA: "`Gazprom' Gives </F>
Ukraine Final Warning and Turns to International Court"] 
  [Text] Government talks between Ukraine and Russia on 
questions of gas deliveries begin 10 March in Moscow. On the 
eve of the talks "Gazprom" representatives confirmed to 
IZVESTIYA that over the holidays Ukraine continued unilaterally 
to take 40 million cubic meters of gas per day from the export 
pipeline. Ukrainian enterprises' overall debt to Russian gas 
industry workers now tops 1.5 trillion rubles [R]. 
  The problem of Ukrainian nonpayments, which has an acute 
impact on the situation of the West Siberian gas fields, has 
periodically flared up over the last two years. Seemingly all 
the methods of settling the conflict by peaceful means have been 
tried. If the Moscow talks produce no guarantees of 
uninterrupted payment for Russian deliveries, then, as your 
IZVESTIYA correspondent was told by "Gazprom" Deputy Chairman 
Vladimir Remizov, the company leadership will be forced to turn 
to the International Court. If this does happen, it will be the 
first time the former Soviet republics, finding themselves 
unable to reach agreement among themselves, have washed their 
dirty linen in public. 
  The last agreement between Ukraine and Russia on gas 
deliveries was signed in February. Ukraine pledged to ensure 
the transit of 111.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas to West 
Europe. Russia is to supply Ukraine with between 50 and 70 
billion cubic meters of gas. The breakdown of these agreements 
is jeopardizing "Gazprom's" far-reaching ambitious plans to 
break into the European market. 
  No matter how much "Gazprom" may threaten to take this 
course, it is technically infeasible to reduce gas deliveries to 
Ukraine, and the chronic defaulters can effectively pump gas out 
of the export pipeline to West Europe with impunity. If the 
Ukrainian leadership's restrictions affect anyone, it is only 
the enterprises working on contracts with "Gazprom." Although 
in early March the concern announced a reduction in gas 
deliveries from 160 million cubic meters to 110 million, in 
reality this had no consequences for the violators of the 
convention. As a result pressure in the pipeline on the border 
with Slovakia fell to danger point. Moreover, Ukraine has 
managed to pump so much gas into underground storage facilities 
that it will be more than enough to get through the 
spring-winter period. 
  According to V. Remizov, "Gazprom's" tough stance at the 
Moscow talks will also include a point about Ukraine repaying 
some of the debts with property in the gas supply system. The 
concern's leadership is interested primarily in the underground 
storage facilities that enable Ukraine to withstand the Russian 
suppliers' financial assaults with no particular problems.

  [Text] Yegor Gaydar met journalists today to share his 
thoughts with them about our economic condition. 
  [Correspondent Matskaviecus] Yegor Gaydar at his news 
conference today categorically denied rumors that he had 
supposedly called on the West not to give financial aid while 
Chernomyrdin and Yeltsin are in power. The former vice premier 
stated that the present government has acted erroneously and 
dishonorably by promising industry money which it is not in a 
position to pay. The Russia's Choice leader believes that this 
year's budget is in need of major changes. Gaydar also dislikes 
the excessive growth of expenditure on the state apparatus and 
the method of financing the provinces which in the future will 
lead to discrimination in favor of Russia's northern regions at 
the expense of the southern regions. 
  Incidentally, the budget for 1994, according to Deputy 
Pochinok, who was also present at the news conference, will be 
adopted at the earliest only in June. 
  Today, the head of Russia's Choice gave a dignified reply to 
the premier's fairly harsh words concerning heads of 
laboratories who jump into ministries, after whose tenure of 
administration the country is shaking as if in a fever. 
  [Begin Gaydar recording] Laboratory head is the only 
scholarly level which I jumped over. I went straight from being 
the head of research workers to being appointed institute 
director. The only thing I can say in regret is that he 
[Premier Chernomyrdin] evidently did not manage to share his 
ideas with me about laboratory heads and ministers when he was 
working under my command as part of the Russian Government. [end 
recording] 
  [Matskaviecus] The Russia's Choice faction will support the 
idea of a memorandum on concord, Gaydar said, only if it is 
convinced that it is not just another fig leaf covering up the 
political ambitions of individual leaders. 
  Commenting on Nixon's visit and his choice of people to 
meet, 
Gaydar thought that the former U.S. president simply did not 
have a real opportunity to evaluate the sincerity of one 
political leader or another. Gaydar himself did not bother to 
meet Nixon today. 
  [Begin Gaydar recording] Yes, I postponed our meeting with 
former U.S. President Richard Nixon in order to make a further 
study of the situation. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent boris Sitnikov] </F>
  [Text] United Nations March 10 TASS -- Russia shares 
Georgia's position on the need for immediate and active measures 
by the international community and calls on the Security Council 
to deploy immediately a peace-keeping force in Abkhazia, Russian 
Ambassador to the U.N. Yuliy Vorontsov said on Wednesday [9 
March] at a Security Council meeting on the situation in 
Abkhazia. 
  Vorontsov noted that "the Russian Federation confirms its 
most serious concern over the continuation of the Abkhazian 
conflict. 
  "Outstanding important issues of a political settlement as 
well as humanitarian problems, above all a return of several 
hundred thousands of refugees and displaced persons to their 
homes, create a real threat of a new bloodshed on a large scale. 
  "To prevent such a tragedy, the international community 
should take energetic steps to give resolute support for the 
peace process. We regard it very important for the Security 
Concil to respond positively to repeated requests by the 
Georgian leadership and the Abkhazian side on the immediate 
start of a full-scale peace-keeping operation in the zone of the 
Abkhazian conflict." 
  Vorontsov noted further that the Russian Federation 
"attaches 
much importance to progress in the negotiating process, 
including the achieved understanding on a full-scale settlement 
based on the unconditional respect for Georgia's territorial 
integrity as well as ensurance of statehood and rights for 
Abkhazia's multinational people". 
  "The Russian Government is firmly convinced that it is 
necessary to deploy immediately a peace-keeping force in the 
zone of the Abkhazian conflict to stimulate the peace process 
and to lend it a successful and, eventually, irreversible 
character. 
  "It is obvious that the final settlement of Abkhazia's 
political status is impossible while over 50 percent of its 
population is outside the republic and active stepts are being 
made to change Abkhazia's ethnic composition. 
  "The Russian Federation fully shares the Georgian 
Government's position that only the deployment of peace keepers 
in the conflict zone can effectively ensure a ceasefire, 
guarantee a safe and mass return of refugees and displaced 
persons to Abkhazia and implementation by the sides of earliers 
understnadings, including that on disengagement of Georgian and 
Abkhazian Armed Forces, as well as disarmement and withdrawal of 
all armed groups which arrived to participate in the conflict 
from abroad. 
  "The Russian Federation favours proposals on immediate 
deployment of peace keepers in the zone of the Abkhazian 
conflict. Loss of time works against a settlement of the 
conflict. The international community should prevent a new 
bloodshed," Vorontsov stressed.

  [Text] Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev has 
arrived in Germany on an official visit. 
  In reply to a question by an ITAR-TASS correspondent on what 
concrete results he hopes to achieve in the course of his visit 
to the FRG, the Russian defense minister emphasized at the 
airport: They will primarily be in questions of expanding 
bilateral cooperation between our countries within the framework 
of the agreements signed in April 1993. Particular attention 
will be paid to the education of our servicemen in the FRG and 
of German servicemen in Russian higher military educational 
establishments. A number of questions will be discussed 
concerning German-Russian military-technical cooperation, since 
part of the military hardware in the Bundeswehr's arsenal was 
produced here. There is special interest in questions of its 
modernization and recycling. 
  Much attention will be paid to the problems of withdrawing 
the Western Group of Forces from German territory, the Russian 
military department chief noted in particular.

  [Text] Rabat, 10 March -- Yasir 'Arafat, chairman of the 
PLO executive committee, received a message from the Russian 
leadership in Tunis on Wednesday [9 March]. The message was 
handed over to the Palestinian leader by Russian President's 
representative Viktor Posuvalyuk. 
  The Russian envoy earlier this week had two meetings with 
Yasir 'Arafat in the Tunisian capital, where the PLO 
headquarters are situated, on Monday and Tuesday. 
  The question of a possible adoption by the UN Security 
Council of a resolution guaranteeing international protection 
for the Palestinian population on the Israeli-occupied Arab 
territories and also the problem of the Jewish settlements there 
were discussed at the meetings. 
  The PLO insists on such resolution following the killing of 
more than 50 Palestinians as a result of the terrorist operation 
by Zionist extremists in a Hebron mosque at the end of February.

  [Text] Moscow March 9 TASS -- Parliamentary hearings, a 
form of parliamentary work which withstood the test of time and 
without which lawmaking in reformed Russia cannot exist, are 
being held increasingly often by deputies of the Russian State 
Duma. 
  In mid-March, Russian lawmakers are scheduled to hold 
debates 
on problems of reform of the local government in the Russian 
Federation. Apart from lawmakers, parliamentary hearings will 
be attended by representatives of the president's 
administration, the Central Electoral Commission, bodies of 
state power of the subjects of the Federation and local 
governments. 
  Parliamentary hearings on "efficient social policy under 
conditions of economic reforms" are expected to be held at about 
the same time and will be attended by members of the government, 
heads of ministries and departments, representatives of trade 
unions and scientists. 
  Parliamentary hearings on the concept of "Russia's 
transition 
to a model of stable development" are scheduled for the second 
half of March. These debates will be held by parliamentary 
committees for the use of nature and natural resources and 
ecology. 
  Russian mps are expected to hold parliamentary debates on 
the 
results of privatisation of state-run and municipal enterprises 
in the Russian Federation in the period between 1992-1993. 
During these debates Russian lawmakers will discuss a state 
programme of privatisation of state and municipal enterprises in 
Russia. These debates will be organized by the Duma Committee 
for Property, Privatisation and Economic Activities.

  [Text] Moscow March 9 TASS -- Sergey Filatov, Russian 
president's chief of staff rejected media reports that talks 
between Russia and its self-style Republic of Chechnya have 
started. Filatov told ITAR-TASS on Wednesday [9 March] that 
indeed he met Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev's 
representatives during his latest visit to the North Caucasus. 
At that meeting Filatov expressed Russia's viewpoint on the 
necessity to sign with Chechnya a powers-sharing treaty as it 
had been done with Russia's another ethnic Republic of 
Tatarstan. But no response from Dudayev has followed as yet, 
Filatov said.

<F P=106> [Report by own correspondent Vladimir Toporkov: "Voting </F>
with Their Feet"] 
  [Text] Lipetsk -- Complete lack of confidence in the new 
electoral system instituted by the president's edict can 
describe the results of the elections to the Lipetsk Oblast 
deputies' assembly. Tormented by excessive prices and mass 
unemployment in Lipetsk (perhaps not a single enterprise is 
working at full capacity) and by notorious privatization as a 
result of which some have become multimillionaires but most have 
become impoverished, at the elections people voted "with their 
feet." The elections were not valid at one of the oblast 
center's 15 electoral districts. And that despite the fact that 
the "pass level" was lowered to 25 percent. 
  For the same reason the elections to the city assembly were 
also invalid. Yet here it was the "city fathers," the head of 
the administration and his deputies, the leaders of industrial 
enterprises, and new capitalist gentlemen who were running for 
the majority of districts. 
  The same attitude toward the new organ of oblast power was 
displayed in Yelets, where not a single candidate got through 
either, because voters failed to turn out. Thus elections were 
valid in only 19 out of 38 districts. But even in those 
districts, mainly rural ones, where the elections were 
successful, the turnout was scarcely more than 50 percent. On 
behalf of whom will the victorious candidates resolve 
legislative questions if most often only 15-20 percent of the 
population voted for them?

  [Text] Kaliningrad March 10 TASS -- The fact that the 
50-year Potsdam agreements will expire next year calls for 
immediate passage of a special law on the status of the 
Kaliningrad region, Speaker of the Parliament's Upper House 
Vladimir Shumeyko said in a televised speech here on Wednesday 
night. 
  He stressed the need for legally confirm that the 
Kaliningrad 
region, Russia's most western area separated from the rest of 
the country by Lithuania and Belarus, belongs to Russia as 
successor to the former Soviet Union, to which the region was 
handed over after World War II as part of former East Prussia. 
At present, the Kaliningrad region's population makes up about 
one million Russians. 
  Shumeyko also pointed to another aspect of the problem, that 
of a greater autonomy and economic freedom the enclave should 
gain to ensure for its residents living conditions comparable 
with those in the rest of Russia. 
  The house speaker intends to employ the Federation Council's 
right for a legislative initiative and move a law on the 
Kaliningrad region's status in the parliament's lower house, the 
State Duma, which certainly has no doubts about the region's 
belonging to Russia.

Yeltsin's edict, Kabardino-Balkaria's President V. Kokov has 
issued his own edict envisaging the restoration of the 
Elbrusskiy and Cherekskiy Rayons in the republic's foothills 
that existed prior to 1944 -- rayons with a predominantly Balkar 
population. 
  This edict orders the formation of a Chamber of 
Nationalities 
within the republic's current parliament in which the republic's 
three main peoples -- Kabards, Russians, and Balkars -- would 
have equal representation. The edict was read out during a 
sorrowful meeting of the republic's public to mark the 50th 
anniversary of the deportation of the Balkar people. It was 
also decided henceforth to celebrate 28 March as the day of the 
Balkar people's return home. It has been declared a day off in 
the republic. Experts think that these measures will stimulate 
the economic, social, and cultural development of Balkaria's 
population centers.

<F P=106> [By unidentified ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 9 Mar -- Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik 
has called for Russian troops to be withdrawn from the Baltic 
republics as soon as possible in an interview with ITAR-TASS. 
"Our position is that the final date for the troops' withdrawal 
should," he stressed, "remain 31 August 1994. There are 2,500 
Russian troops in Estonia at present. This minimal number of 
troops could have been pulled out much sooner. But when Russia 
proposed a compromise option, giving 31 August as the date, we 
agreed with her, understanding as we do the difficulties." 
  "Estonia," Luik continued, "welcomes the recent statement by 
the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin that Russia 
would not tie the problem of the Russian-speaking population in 
the Baltic region to the withdrawal of its troops. That is the 
correct position. We also believe that Russia should first 
fulfill its international obligation and pull out its troops and 
then we can settle all the other matters." 
  As for the rest, in the opinion of the minister relations 
between Russia and Estonia are developing normally. "If, for 
instance, you look at trade links, then they are not bad at 
all," said Luik. "There is a very active commercial transit and 
imports from Russia and exports out of Estonia are also active. 
Part of the humanitarian aid to Russia passes through Estonian 
ports. The two countries' business circles are developing their 
cooperation well. We have nothing to complain about on that 
score." 
  When asked if there was any territorial dispute between 
Russia and Estonia, Luik replied: "The Estonian side believes 
that it is necessary to observe the 1920 peace treaty signed in 
Tartu. But we have always called for this question to be 
resolved peacefully, at negotiations. We also have proposed 
resorting to the International Court at the Hague on the matter 
in question or, which would be even better, to make use of the 
intermediary services of a third party. We do not intend to 
dramatize this issue. For us the main thing is the withdrawal 
of the troops. We can solve the remaining problems later."

  [Text] Tallinn, March 9 -- Commenting upon the meeting of 
the three Baltic Foreign Ministers with German Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel in Bonn, on Tuesday [8 March], Estonian Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Juri Luik told ETA that Kinkel had clearly 
expressed his support to Estonian aspirations in saying that 
Russian troops have to be gone from Estonia by August 31, 1994 
without any additional conditions. 
  As to other international issues the ministers discussed 
relations of the Baltic states with the European Union [EU]. 
Kinkel expressed hope that the Baltic states would become 
members of EU as quickly as possible, for which talks on the 
free trade agreements should be concluded already at the 
beginning of this summer. 
  Luik said that the meeting had also dwelt upon Estonia's 
relations with other international organizations. In May 
meeting of the Baltic Sea states Foreign Ministers will take 
place in Tallinn, where both Klaus Kinkel and Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev are expected to participate. 
  Besides these problems German investments to Estonia, 
visa-free travelling and compensating the damage done to Estonia 
by Nazi occupation were discussed.

  [Excerpt] Tallinn, Mar 09, BNS -- The Estonian prime 
minister yesterday welcomed what he said was clear and strong 
support from the Nordic countries to his nation's demand that 
Russia abide by its earlier suggested deadline of Aug. 31, 1994, 
for troop withdrawal from Estonia. 
  Political support which we expected to get from the Nordic 
countries over Russian troop withdrawal has been received and is 
unexpectedly clear-worded and strong, Prime Minister Mart Laar 
said. 
  The prime ministers of the Nordic countries at a meeting of 
the Nordic Council in Stockholm Monday [7 March] issued a 
statement urging for a quick, orderly and complete withdrawal of 
Russian troops from Estonia and Latvia by Aug. 31, 1994. 
  The Estonian leader in his remarks to BNS today said it was 
particularly good that the Nordic leaders in their statement 
very strongly asserted the final deadline for the pullout.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 09, BNS - Estonia, Latvia and 
Lithuania must speedily work out the legal basis for formation 
of the Baltics' common peacekeeping battalion, Estonian Prime 
Minister Mart Laar said in a press conference today. He added 
that he hoped the countries will manage to do this. 
  Setting up a common Baltic peacekeeping battalion was one of 
the topics discussed at a meeting in Stockholm Tuesday [8 March] 
between Laar, his Latvian counterpart Valdis Birkavs and 
Lithuanian Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius. 
  "It seems that the Nordic countries are ready to help the 
Baltics in the formation of the battalion in every possible way, 
including training. We from our side try to find out how 
peacekeeping battalions were created in the Nordic countries and 
what their structure is," Laar said. 
  The head of Lithuania's defense forces, Gen. Jonas 
Andriskevicius, said Tuesday that lawyers at his central staff 
are currently working on the legal basis for the peacekeeping 
battalion. He said soldiers for the common battalion are to be 
trained at a base in Alytus, southern Lithuania. The general 
said a former Soviet paratrooper units base there was offering 
excellent conditions for training the staff of the new force.

  [Text]Tallinn, Mar 09, BNS -- The Baltics have coordinated 
their common tactics and aims for the talks with Russia, 
Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar said at a press conference 
today. 
  Laar was speaking to reporters after returning from 
Stockholm 
where Laar, his Latvian counterpart Valdis Birkavs, and 
Lithuania's Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius attended an 
annual meeting of the Nordic Council. 
  But Laar declined to elaborate on the topic of the common 
tactics. 
  He said relations of all three with Russia were quite 
similar 
at the moment. 
  "Also the situation of Lithuania is not much better than 
that 
of Estonia and Latvia, because problems are created by the 
Kaliningrad region and Russia's military transits through 
Lithuania. When Estonia and Latvia once succeed in getting the 
Russian troops out, the Kaliningrad region surely will become 
one of the main security political problems of the Baltic 
region," the Estonian leader said. 
  He added that the Nordic prime ministers had issued 
clear-worded political support to demands by Estonia and Latvia 
that Russian troops be pulled out from these countries by Aug. 
31. 
  The Nordic prime ministers in a statement issued at the 
meeting Monday said Russia must withdraw its troops from Estonia 
and Latvia by Aug. 31, 1994. 
  Laar said it was very important that the statement included 
the final date for the troop withdrawal. 
  He said the meeting in Stockholm had named absurd Russia's 
demands that Estonia must pay 23 million U.S. dollars to build 
houses for the repatriated Russian military. 
  "Some of the Nordic countries have already allocated money 
for building flats for military leaving to Russia and have also 
signed agreements on the issue. Sweden is ready to allocate 
money at once after the troop withdrawal agreement is signed. 
There was also an idea voiced in Stockholm that the aid should 
be channeled directly to the Baltic countries if Russia 
continues its present course," Laar said. 
  The Estonian prime minister had separate meetings in 
Stockholm with prime ministers Carl Bildt of Sweden and Esko Aho 
of Finland. 
  "At those bilateral meetings I didn't deal with complaining 
about the situation that has emerged, but tried to seek concrete 
ways for solution. For Estonia speedy integration with Europe 
surely is one possibility," he concluded.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 08, BNS -- Estonia theoretically can 
join the European Union [EU] only in 1998, but in reality this 
is likely to happen even later, said Ivar Raig, the head of the 
government's work group for issues of joining the EU. 
  The work group to prepare Estonia's application for 
membership in the European body was set up in December. 
  Members in the group will gather and prepare data on whether 
it is advisable for Estonia to join the EU, when and where to do 
it, what are the things Estonia still has to do to measure up to 
the EU standards, and what can the EU offer to Estonia, and 
Estonia, to the EU, Raig said. 
  The topics all together number 23 and are divided between 
the 
groups for foreign and security policy, for economic and social 
policy, and for political decisions and legislation, he said. 
  The documents to be drawn up will be also circulated to 
shape 
a positive attitude toward Estonia within the EU. The materials 
must reflect Estonia's readiness to join the Union, Raig said, 
reminding that Estonia's future membership has to be ratified by 
each of the EU full members. 
  Raig said the materials must be submitted by March 31. Also 
to be elected is an international group of experts to sponsor 
Estonia's moves in Brussels. 
  He said his work group is also preparing for an 
international 
congress due on Oct. 5-7. 
  The people's opinion will be asked in a referendum at the 
time when Estonia already has obtained an associate member's 
status, i.e. not before 1998, Raig added. 
  The work group meets once a month, but the board of the 
group 
is meeting more often, he said.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 09, BNS -- The number of crimes 
committed by Russian military in Estonia has grown in recent 
months, Tallinn Police Chief Ralf Palo said in a press 
conference today. He said the number was evidently even higher, 
for not all illegal activity has been uncovered. 
  Police have arrested many Russian military suspected of 
crime 
during the past month. 
  On March 8, police arrested two employees of a Russian 
military unit in Tallinn. The men are suspected to have robbed 
a Tallinn resident. 
  A day before, the security police and the police special 
task 
force "K" conducted an operation which resulted in the arrest of 
two men who illegally sold weapons. The suspects had offered to 
sell a consignment of Russian-made TT pistols. One of the men 
was Yuri Terzikyan, noncommissioned officer at the Russian unit 
stationed at Tondi, Tallinn. 
  Early on March 2, two Russian servicemen escaped from the 
correctional isolation chambers of the Tallinn garrison, taking 
two machine guns with 60 cartridges. 
  On March 1 Estonian border guards detained Russian navy 
noncommissioned officer Alexander Yegorov at the border 
checkpoint to Russia in Narva, northeast Estonia, on an attempt 
to take a stolen Lada car out of Estonia. 
  Police had to interfere and stop Russian servicemen when the 
latter in late February started to pull down a holiday home at 
Suurupi near Tallinn. The holiday home had been leased to a 
private company. Charges have been brought against the military 
of the Tondi unit, including for 10,000 [currency not specified] 
in damages to the leaseholder company. 
  Also in February, Estonian police seized 500 kilograms of 
high-power explosive from a Russian noncommissioned officer. 
Experts say the amount was sufficient to explode the World 
Trade Center in New York. The man also had 12,000 pieces of gun 
ammunition which he claimed he intended to sell.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 46 (536) </F>
Reports by Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor 
Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] President Boris Yeltsin laid flowers Wednesday to 
the burial place in the Kremlin wall of the world's first 
cosmanaut Yuriy Gagarin who would have been 60 on March 9. The 
president answered questions of journalists, one of whom was an 
Interfax reporter. 
  Asked by Interfax's Boris Grishchenko about the civil peace 
in the country, Yeltsin said, 
  "I called for civil peace and accord in the presidential 
message to the Federal Assembly and in my talk to parliament. 
We must work out an appropriate document on this. An accord 
must be reached between various parties, movements and branches 
of authority. This idea was supported by the leadership of the 
State Duma and the Federation Council, the government and 
numerous parliamentary groups. 
  I invited the leaders of these organizations to meet at 
10:00 
tomorrow, Thursday to agree on working out the document on civil 
peace and accord. It must be drafted within about two weeks. 
Then we will decide in what procedure it should be adopted. 
All strata of our society should contribute to the wording of 
this document if a genuine civil accord should follow its 
signing. I hope that this will be so." 
  He had this to say about his Wednesday meeting the 
television 
officials: 
  "I had a difficult talk with Aleksandr Yakovlev and Oleg 
Poptsov about political processes in the country as well as 
television. I had told the Federal Assembly that the first and 
second channels must be state-owned. This caused what can be 
described in mild terms as agitation in Ostankino (television 
center), as far as I know. 
  I don't think this should be dramatized. In particular, 
Yakovlev suggests a `softer' version of the future presidential 
decree. Poptsov has his own view of the problem. All this can 
be negotiated. But we must come out with a solution, otherwise 
we stand to lose state channels to various parties and 
movements. The channels may be fragmented and bribery may take 
its toll." 
  Speaking of the economic situation in the country Yeltsin 
said, "In the morning I had a thorough talk with Deputy Prime 
Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha, in particular on agriculture. 
  I am saying this for the first time to the Russian people, 
the CIS member states and the world: for the first time in 
three or four decades we will not buy grain abroad at all this 
year. Somebody can be surprised that we will not buy wool, 
eiher, because we could never do without imported wool but this 
year we will. Nor will we buy flax. All Russian processing 
factories have a good supply of agricultural raw materials. In 
particular, we have grain of good quality for the spring sowing. 
  As recently as two years ago many people said that hunger 
was 
imminent but now we are in a position to say that the Russians 
will undoubtedly have enough food. We can discuss variety of 
foodstuffs and their quality which should be at least as high as 
in foreign products. We are thinking of more reasonable prices." 
  Answering questions about the status of the Russo-American 
relations, in particular the spying scare in the U.S.A., Yeltsin 
emphasized, 
  "This has happened on numerous occasions. Every country has 
an intelligence service. Whoever catches a foreign intelligence 
officer wins, those who are caught lose. No dramatic 
conclusions should be made from such events. I am sure that 
this will not affect the Russo-American relations. 
  Now, former U.S. president Richard Nixon met with Rutskoy, 
Zyuganov and others of this kind. But he came here for a 
meeting with me. 
  I appreciate President Bill Clinton's disavowal of Nixon." 
  Interfax's question: Will you receive the U.S. ex-president? 
  Yeltsin: No, not after this. He will not be received by the 
government, either. Nor will [presidential chief of staff] 
Filatov receive him. Mr. Nixon must know that Russia is a 
great country which must not be trifled with. 
  The Americans and we must prepare carefully the Vladivostok 
meeting of foreign ministers (scheduled for March 14). The 
Russo-American partnership was not easy to come by and we should 
not lose it. I am sure that we will not."

  [Text] Moscow March 10 TASS -- "The time of confrontation 
is over. Russia has embarked on a new path", President Yeltsin 
said in his opening address at his meeting in the Kremlin today 
with representatives of different public and political 
movements, the Federation Council, groups and groupings in the 
State Duma, and the government. 
  The meeting, devoted to drafting a memorandum on civil 
accord 
and peace in the country, was attended by Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, Russian Orthodox Church Chief Patriarch Aleksey, 
Constitutional Court Chairman Nikolay Vitruk, representatives of 
parliamentary groups Russia's Choice, Communists of Russia and 
the Agrarian Party, as well as of the Miners Independent Trade 
Union. 
  The president called for drafting a document to bring 
together all political movements and representatives of the 
state power. According to him, "the programme of any party, be 
it communist or democratic, contains provisions concerning 
problems of importance for the entire country and care for each 
Russian citizen". These common provisions should be summarised 
and incorporated in the memorandum on civil accord and peace. 
  President Yeltsin said a working group should be set up to 
draft the text of the memorandum. He suggested that the group 
be made up of five people with Boris Topronin, co-chairman of 
the president's public chamber, as its head. 
  According to the president, the working group should draft 
the memorandum and submit it for discussion in two weeks. He 
said he expected every party and public movement to consider the 
draft. 
  The president also proposed that participants in the meeting 
discuss a mechanism of adopting the memorandum on civil concord 
and peace. "It is necessary to involve the widest possible range 
of representatives of parties and public movements in the 
signing of this document," President Yeltsin said.

  [Text] Moscow March 9 ITAR-TASS -- Russia's Deputy 
Prosecutor General Eduard Denisov appealed against the decision 
by the Supreme Court's Military Collegium to dismiss the case of 
the August 1991 coup plotters. The decision was prompted by the 
parliament's notorious resolution of February 23, 1994, on a 
sweeping political amnesty. 
  Denisov argues that the Military Collegium's decision does 
not comply with the Criminal Processual Code of the Russian 
Federation, which demands that once initiated, any proceedings 
in court should be carried though and end with passing a verdict 
of either "guilty" or "not-guilty".

  [Text] The Lefortovo remand unit has remained in joint

General Prosecutor's Office for only one week. 
  MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS reported earlier that as of 22 
February, Lefortovo prison had been placed under the 
jurisdiction of the General Prosecutor's Office while remaining 
on the Federal Counterintelligence Service's books. Now 
Yeltsin's secret directive hands over Lefortovo remand unit, as 
of 1 March, to the financial care of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. From now on, the Ministry of Internal Affairs owns all 
Lefortovo property -- the building, weapons, and vehicles used 
in the remand unit. Simultaneously, all Lefortovo personnel 
have been transferred to serve in the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs system. 
  This decision was of course called for by the recent scandal 
around the release of the October revolt leaders from the 
prison. Yeltsin seems to want the prison to be controlled in the 
future by people he trusts explicitly -- that is, [Internal 
Affairs Minister Viktor] Yerin and his team.

<F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report under the "Defense" rubric: </F>
"Russian Army Suffers Defeat in Budget Struggle. Defense 
Ministry Threatens Loss of `Control Over the Armed Forces'"] 
  [Text] The Armed Forces' chiefs believe that the 1994 
budget proposed by the government will bring about a catastrophe 
unless defense expenditures are approved according to the 
existing official draft. At a recent (not expanded and 
closed-door) government meeting, First Deputy Defense Minister 
Andrey Kokoshin said "at the request of the defense minister and 
the ministry's collegium" that "neither the country's defense 
capability nor the maintenance of the defense industry will be 
possible at this level of financing. Clearly, the trend is 
toward the loss of control over the Armed Forces." 
  In 1993, the defense budget was 7.1. trillion rubles [R] 
(taking into account repeated indexations), but actual military 
expenditures were greater, so by year's end the Defense Ministry 
owed suppliers and its own staffers R2.2 trillion. Defense 
Ministry representatives think that if the current inflation 
rate (around 1,000 percent a year) holds on, at least R80 
trillion will have to be spent on the maintenance of the Armed 
Forces. 
  The new budget earmarks R37.1 trillion rubles for defense, 
which accounts for approximately 20 percent of the budget 
expenditures. Andrey Kokoshin claims that this amounts to a more 
than two-fold decrease in actual expenditures. In 1992, when 
market reform began, the government slashed its defense orders 
by 67 percent. At the time, the government assured the Defense 
Ministry, however, that there would be no new drastic cuts, and 
that the level of defense appropriations would remain unchanged 
until 1995. Now the plans for military reform, personnel and 
arms procurement cuts that were drawn up in view of a certain 
amount of financing are in jeopardy. 
  Government orders for arms procurements in 1994 have already 
been approved, but Defense Ministry specialists estimate that 
its implementation will cost R28.3 trillion, whereas the draft 
budget calls for only R5.5 trillion. The Defense Ministry is 
drawing up an official letter to the government demanding that: 
first, that the cessation of armaments production in Russia be 
openly declared; second, that the 1994 government defense orders 
be canceled; and third, that contracts with enterprises for the 
supply of weapons be abrogated. 
  Andrey Kokoshin believes that the implementation of the 
draft 
budget will result in the closure of over 3,000 
military-industrial enterprises; as a consequence, around 4 
million people will be out of work, 15 million of their family 
members will be left without a living, and many Russian 
"defense" cities will turn into social disaster areas. 
Moreover, the army will have to fully stop signing up soldiers 
under contracts, and also urgently to discharge from service 
400,000 servicemen (over 20 percent of the entire strength). 
Half of them are officers and warrant officers, who will have to 
be discharged without legitimate service benefits and 
accommodation. 
  The struggle for the budget continues, and each department, 
according to an old Soviet tradition, is trying to grab as much 
as it can. The Defense Ministry is currently losing to more 
influential sectoral lobbyists. But the Armed Forces have yet 
another, last argument in store. SEGODNYA has learned that the 
president has written on General Grachev's letter stating the 
army's budget arguments: "I share the defense minister's 
concern. I ask you to weigh everything one more time. A 
solution should be sought without detriment to Russia's defense 
capability."

  [Text] Russia's ground forces remain the basis of Russia's 
Army. However, the outlook for their development is unclear. 
That is how Colonel General Vladimir Semenov, commander in 
chief of ground forces, has described the present position of 
the units and subunits in his charge. According to him they do 
not possess at present even the minimum means for further 
development. The commander in chief is particularly concerned 
about the residual principle of providing personnel for the 
ground forces. In Vladimir Semenov's opinion the ground forces 
must in the longer term become mobile, well managed, and able to 
carry out any assignment.

centers for maintaining peace. Linas Linkevicius also drew 
attention to the efforts by Carl Bildt to strengthen by every 
means the cooperation between the Nordic countries and the 
Baltic states, according to the formula five plus three. 
  Somewhat earlier, meeting journalists, the Swedish prime 
minister was for the continuous expansion of the European Union,

<F P=106> [Report by Ricardas Jarmalavicius: "A Confidential Meeting </F>
With the Chechens"] 
  [Text] As we have learned from reliable sources, 
yesterday, Lithuanian Prosecutor General A. Paulauskas and his 
Chechen counterpart I. Sheripova signed an agreement on 
cooperation between the two offices in investigating criminal 
cases. 
  Chechen Prosecutor General I. Sheripova arrived in Vilnius 
on 
Tuesday [1 March]. The visit was shrouded in secrecy from the 
very beginning. V. Eidukaitis, representative of Chechen 
President D. Dudayev in Lithuania, told RESPUBLIKA that Mrs. I. 
Sheripova had arrived at his invitation to "settle certain 
issues." According to Seimas [parliament] Deputy A. 
Endriukaitis, leader of the group for Lithuanian-Chechen 
parliamentary relations, employees of the Lithuanian and the 
Chechen Prosecutor General's Offices have cooperated constantly. 
  I. Sheripova also avoided a definitive reply by telling a 
RESPUBLIKA correspondent that she, as well as her Lithuanian 
colleagues, were concerned with the same problem -- crime. 
  As one employee, who wished to remain anonymous, told 
RESPUBLIKA, by signing the agreement, the Lithuanian Prosecutor 
General's Office has found itself in an "awkward" position. The 
reason is that the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry is worried that 
the agreement with the Chechen Republic as an independent state 
might harm our relations with Russia, which views this Caucasian 
state as its republic. Nor has Lithuania recognized the 
independence of this country. It was decided not to publicize 
this agreement so as to avoid a diplomatic incident.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Spirit of Political Innocence..."] </F>
  [Excerpts] Since the fifth round of talks between Lithuania 
and Poland on the interstate agreement is over, we can finally 
say with relief -- it seems that we have the treaty. We say "it 
seems," because politicians get down to work after diplomats 
finish their job, and the aims of the first often differ from 
those of the latter. Therefore, it is not accidental that on 
Tuesday [22 February], Deputy Foreign Minister V. Domarkas, who 
heads the delegation for negotiations, evaded a definite reply 
to RESPUBLIKA's straight question whether this really meant 
accomplished work. "We coordinated everything what can be 
coordinated on the level of deputy ministers," such was his 
diplomatic reply. One should interpret it in this way: We have 
done our job, but will politicians like the result...? 
Certainly, not all of them. Negotiations with Poland have 
become one of Lithuania's protracted foreign policy myths, as 
well as a yielding cow from which most of our radicals like to 
milk political dividends. The Poles are insidious invaders who 
day and night think about recovering Vilnius occupied by 
Zeligowski in 1920. They began to hammer this idea into 
people's heads long before the declaration of independence. 
Certainly, there is no fire without smoke. However, Lithuanian 
political radicals exaggerate Poland's interests in the Vilnius 
region (anyway, several thousand Poles live here). Some of 
these enthusiasts looked for and, of course, found certain 
parallels with Nazi activities in the Klaipeda region in the 
1930's. 
  Our patriotically disposed countrymen did not even consider 
that the situation in the late 20th century in Europe is 
different from that in the third decade. [passage omitted] 
Frontiers are falling. Although with creaks, Europe is 
uniting. Lithuania is also declaring its intention to become a 
member of the European Union and sign a free trade agreement 
with it. Even our greatest "Polophobes" approve this. However, 
one simple truth seems to escape their heads for some reason -- 
we can reach the long-desired Europe only through our western 
neighbor -- Poland. Therefore, even the staunchest advocates of 
Lithuanian "Eurocentrism" should understand that normalizing our 
relations with Poland and signing a bilateral agreement is 
primarily more in our interest than in theirs. Instead of 
assuming the position of insulted historical innocence, we 
should demonstrate more flexibility and not try to revive the 
70-year-old specter of Zeligowski. If we want to become 
civilized Europeans, we should behave according to their 
standards. [passage omitted] 
  In the current draft treaty coordinated by diplomats, Poland 
recognizes Vilnius as the capital of Lithuania and condemns 
certain historical events in the preamble. 
  However, this is insufficient for those Polish and 
Lithuanian 
politicians who feed on political disputes. On the day of 
negotiations, the Polish Catholic daily SLOWO published an open 
letter to Polish leaders, demanding that special guarantees for 
Lithuania's Poles be incorporated in the treaty. In the 
authors' opinion, first of all, such guarantees should be 
considered in the talks between the Polish Government and the 
Lithuanian Poles' Union. One could ignore this letter, if the 
author was not the blatant and influential organization "Kresy" 
[territory to the east of Poland formerly under its rule]. 
  Yesterday, we could hear some Lithuanian voices cautiously 
condemning the treaty as well. Former Foreign Minister A. 
Saudargas, member of the Christian Democratic Party, deemed it a 
"unilateral concession" at yesterday's press conference. 
[passage omitted] 
  We would like to draw the attention of all future critics to 
the following fact -- on the day when V. Domarkas was shaking 
hands with I. Biczewski [Polish deputy foreign minister], the 
latter's chief [Olechowski] was greeting the Russian foreign 
minister [Kozyrev]. Judging by the comments on Polish 
television, Moscow is operatively improving its relations with 
Warsaw. If the latter's ties with Russia really strengthen, 
while those with Vilnius deteriorate, in what situation will 
Lithuania find itself? It is worth remembering that before 
World War II the "Baltic Entente" was not established only 
because of Lithuania's difficult relations with Poland. This 
was useful to the USSR and Germany alone. Do Lithuania's great 
patriots want this situation to recur?

<F P=106> [Report by Raimonda Rameliene: "Which Color Government, </F>
Except the Red One, Will Save Lithuania?"] 
  [Excerpts] On Wednesday [23 February] evening before 
"Panorama" [television newscast] aired, representatives of four 
political forces spent 45 minutes discussing a truly global 
problem: Can the government headed by A. Slezevicius be trusted? 
As it had been reported before, such a topic for a televised 
discussion was proposed by the Democratic Party. Five of the 
six participants in the program are Seimas [parliament] deputies 
-- G. Pavirzis and A. Kuncinas (the Lithuanian Democratic Labor 
Party [LDDP] ), V. Andriukaitis (the Social Democratic Party), 
S. Peceliunas, and J. Tartilas (the Democratic Party). Thus, it 
is natural that the debate reminded everyone of the "sweet" oral 
clashes between the majority and the opposition in the 
legislature, and echoed the recent Seimas discussion on the 
country's internal situation. [passage omitted] The only person 
not "elected" by the nation was A. Ambrazevicius, representative 
of the Movement for National Progress. 
  Opening the discussion, S. Peceliunas raised two questions: 
Would the change of government provide anything today, and would 
the new officials really conduct a policy that is not harmful to 
the state? Has the time come to replace those who appointed 
this government? 
  Providing examples from the recent activities of the Foreign 
Ministry and the Ministry of Transportation (uncontrolled 
military transit, the problem of the Adutiskis railway station 
[dispute with Belarus], attitudes toward the Polish-Lithuanian 
treaty), the democrats' representative drew the following 
conclusion: "I think that we should not discharge the 
government en masse now." It might be sufficient to replace 
four ministers by citing specific charges of acting against the 
state. In S. Peceliunas' opinion, however, there is another 
problem: The ruling party itself is incapable of managing the 
country. "Therefore, it is getting upset and angry with itself 
and others." The fact that the entire LDDP list found itself in 
the Seimas after the elections is responsible for this 
situation. Many representatives of the majority do not even 
know now what they have to do. Would not they be worth 
replacing? A referendum on the people's confidence in the 
government could answer this question. 
  A. Kuncinas, who had told journalists back on Wednesday 
morning that the topic of discussion was formulated incorrectly, 
reminded everyone that the manner of changing the government is 
indicated in the Constitution and the Seimas Statute. 
Therefore, there was no need to discuss such an issue in 
public. It would be also improper for the LDDP to express no 
confidence in its own government. The LDDP may criticize and 
reprimand it, which is being accomplished, and search for 
solutions. 
  V. Andriukaitis repeatedly listed the promises and 
commitments given by the sixth cabinet of ministers which it 
failed to fulfill, and reminded the government of its political 
responsibility. At the same time, he stressed that the 
government crisis in Lithuania is deep and that it has continued 
for several years. There is hardly such a political force today 
which could resolve all our problems by itself. In V. 
Andriukaitis' opinion, it would be useful to draft a doctrine of 
interpellation that would help determine whether a broad 
political coalition was possible, attract specialists, freeze 
all claims for two years, and design a serious program which 
would be approved by all forces after reaching a consensus. 
  According to V. Andriukaitis, an interpellation to the 
government does not mean its overthrow. It could manifest 
itself through parliamentary criticism, debates, and proposals, 
which would be a serious step toward progress. 
  According to G. Pavirzis, even though the government is 
reprimanded greatly, it is imposing. The Seimas deputy reminded 
everyone that after the elections, the LDDP called on all 
political forces to form a coalition government, but the latter 
refused. [passage omitted] It is easy to criticize programs. 
However, the times when five-year plans were fulfilled in three 
years are already over. We should not interfere with the 
government's work, the more so since the LDDP does not shun 
responsibility. 
  "Lithuania will hardly ever be in such a unique situation as 
today," said A. Ambrazevicius. The LDDP has the parliamentary 
majority, the Presidency, the government, and the prime 
minister, who is also the party chairman. Thus, its 
responsibility is unequivocal. However, the LDDP often behaves 
as though it did not have this majority. This is bad, because 
these four years in office are the party's chance. LDDP's 
political future will depend on its ability to use this chance. 
The opposition should not obstruct the ruling majority, demand 
early elections, and so on. Unfortunately, it resorts to the 
principle "the worse for the state, the better for the 
opposition" more often today. [passage omitted] 
  J. Tartilas shared A. Ambrazevicius' opinion on the 
government's dependence. "The spectrum is really monochromatic 
-- the president, the Seimas, and the government." However, two 
years have passed since the "red color began to administer 
Lithuania," and what has been accomplished? J. Tartilas said 
that he saw a much deeper meaning in this issue than just a 
government collapse. This might be the desire to avoid 
responsibility and oust the government with the opposition's 
hands. One could explain later that the opposition is to blame 
for everything. Thus, J. Tartilas suggested that the LDDP 
government be allowed to work for its full four-year term. 
However, if we were to replace it, we should change the entire 
"spectrum." 
  Replying to some people's doubts, S. Peceliunas explained: 
"We do not seek power. We are talking about Lithuania's 
situation and perspective. We see that the current manner of 
governing reduces this perspective, while the majority would not 
listen to our proposals." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Riga, Mar 09, BNS -- The March 7 statement by 
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin was an attempt 
to exert political pressure on Latvia, the head of the Latvian 
parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee said Tuesday [8 March]. 
  As reported, Churkin told reporters Monday that Russia has 
not taken any obligation to withdraw its troops from Latvia and 
Estonia by the end of August. 
  Alexander Kirsteins, head of the Saeima [parliament] 
committee, argued that Russia has long declared its commitment 
to complete the pullout by Aug. 31 if Latvia compromises on the 
radar installation at Skrunda and social guarantees for war 
pensioners. 
  Russia has not signed any international treaty that would 
have made it assume any obligations regarding the troop 
withdrawal. 
  In the Kirsteins' words, the absence of formal agreements 
allows Russia to fix the withdrawal deadline arbitrarily and 
interpret the Latvian stance on debatable issues in an ambiguous 
manner. 
  On the other hand, Latvia has also undertaken no 
international obligations to supply electricity to Russian 
installations on its soil, Kirsteins said. Consequently, there 
were no reason for Russia to protest the explosion at the 
Skrunda's high voltage electricity post.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 08, BNS -- Latvia's Government committee 
for the assessment of environmental, health and social problems 
connected with the operation of the former Soviet radar 
installation at Skrunda will soon present a survey on the topics. 
  The committee's actions will not depend on the anticipated 
contract with Russia on the further use and dismantling of the 
radar station, said the committee head, the country's 
Environmental Protection and Regional Development Minister Girts 
Lukins. 
  The group sees its chief task in rehabilitation of 
residents' 
health and sanation of the environment, said Lukins. 
  "The committee's work will be over only when the locals 
start 
to feel better, and this is by no means connected with this 
treaty between Latvia and Russia," said the minister. 
  The group was set up in February. It includes officials of 
the Environmental Protection and Regional Development Ministry, 
Welfare Ministry, Foreign Ministry, Defense Ministry, Finance 
Ministry, physicians and local authorities. 
  As reported, Russia has promised to get its troops out of 
Latvia until Aug. 31 if the Baltic country allows it keep the 
radar for five and a half years.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 08, BNS -- The Latvian Saeima 
(parliament) Foreign Affairs' Committee agreed Tuesday [8 March] 
to build the country's foreign policies concept on the report by 
Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs at a security-related conference. 
  The new concept is aimed at enlarging Latvia's contacts with 
the European Union, the West European Union and NATO, said 
committee head Alexander Kirsteins. 
  Latvia should prepare a free trade treaty with the European 
Union and to join the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly 
as an associated member, Kirsteins said, commenting on the most 
urgent diplomatic tasks. 
  Goodneighborly relations with Russia is another mainstream 
of 
Latvia's political activities. 
  Russia, as the legal heir of the collapsed Soviet Union, 
should recognize that Latvia was forcefully incorporated into 
the Soviet Union in 1940. This recognition could be regarded as 
a landmark for building better relations between the two 
countries, said Kirsteins. 
  Latvia must soon adopt a citizenship law and a document 
regulating the rights of non-citizens, Kirsteins noted. 
  Kirsteins also praised President Boris Yeltsin's initiative 
to draft a uniform human rights convention to ensure mutual 
guarantees in the field of human rights preservation in Latvia 
and Russia. 
  The Latvian prime minister plans to address a Saeima plenary 
session with a more detailed version of his security report.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Oleg Meshkov: "Latvia: Abyss Ever </F>
Deeper"] 
  [Text] Riga -- Three years ago there was a poll of the 
population in Latvia with a view to ascertaining its attitude 
toward the republic's secession from the USSR. Many 
nonindigenous inhabitants sincerely believed that this act was 
in the mainstream of the democratic transformations which had 
begun and candidly answered that they were in favor. But now 
they have become convinced that they were simply misled. And on 
the third anniversary of that memorable poll a mass protest 
meeting was held on Riflemen's Square in central Riga, announced 
as a memorial meeting for the defunct "Latvian democracy for 
all." The triumphal all-Latvia poll laid the foundation not to 
interethnic harmony but created a "Republic of South Africa in 
the center of Europe" -- that was the leitmotiv of the speakers' 
speeches. 
  Municipal elections will be held in Latvia soon. The Latvian 
saeima has adopted a law whereby only citizens of the republic 
can elect the municipal organs of power. Now the saeima intends 
to deliver another blow to noncitizens: A draft law on the 
status of the deputies of local organs of management of all 
levels has been put on the plenary session's agenda in its 
third, final, reading. At the initiative of the national 
radicals it includes a clause compelling deputies to receive 
voters and examine the applications and appeals of voters, that 
is only of those who are Latvian citizens. 
  The Latvian league of stateless persons has notified the 
republic's leaders and the ambassadors of foreign states that 
depriving noncitizens of the right to resolve their delay 
problems at elected municipal level and simply to be received is 
a gross act of provocation which pushes hundreds of thousands of 
outcasts to create their own alternative organs and 
representative missions at municipal level.

<F P=106> [Article by Janis Domburs: "Does Voldemars Selga Surpass </F>
Those Who Vanished in Lake Constance?"] 
  [Excerpts] Western security services are linking the trade 
in radioactive and nuclear materials with threats to 
international security. However, big money apparently can also 
be earned by dealing with nonradioactive isotopes, prices for 
which on the black market often are no lower and sometimes even 
higher than those for radioactive ones. The deal that Rimmele 
and Eichler [not further identified] concluded in Riga was 
valued at $2 million. Nevertheless, even this seems to be 
nothing in comparison with the sums with which Voldemars Selga, 
a well-known businessman in Latvia, is operating in deals 
concerning rare metals. 
  The document, which can be seen in the picture [published in 
English and Latvian next to the article and reported below], 
dated 3 February of this year, is called, literally translated, 
"Usage of bank guarantees of the Reconstruction and Development 
Bank [RDB] of Latvia for buying osmium." The text refers to an 
already received [two last words underlined] guarantee from RDB 
for $4,555,000,000 (! - J.D.) for the Finnish company 
"Wimco-Erica Finland Ltd" to purchase osm-187, and contains a 
requirement to confirm the right to use this guarantee to buy 
32.9 kg of osm-187 in Russia. The RDB board president and owner 
of the control package is Voldemars Selga. 
  There are also materials in which the Finnish side confirms 
that the purchasing of osm has already begun. Actually, it must 
have started before one of the signatories, visible in the 
picture, began to talk about seeking -- even with the assistance 
of INTERPOL -- V. Selga's partner, RDB Vice President Andrejs 
Zagars, on suspicion of fraud... 
  The fax visible in the picture did not reach its intended 
recipient, and this explains why V. Selga's signature is not on 
the document. The sources of the above mentioned information 
are not sufficient to provide a precise description of the deal. 
Nevertheless, there can be no doubt about such guarantees by the 
bank. According to the initial capital and capital stock, 
amounting to several hundred thousand lats, RDB only ranks 
somewhere in top 40 or 50 commercial banks in Latvia, and it 
should not have the right to give a guarantee for a million 
dollars, let alone any figure in the billions. 
  Suspicion also arouse over the fact that the mentioned 
quantity of osm -- 33 kg -- is too big. Experts in Germany, 
commenting on the plans of Rimmele and Eichler to buy only 6 kg 
of osm-187 in China, acknowledged that demand for this material 
is measured in milligrams... 
  We do not have any more detailed information about the 
Finnish role. This cannot be said about possibilities to 
describe the personality of V. Selga. In 1984, during the era 
of the Soviet Union, he was sentenced to prison for fraud and 
falsification. Is Selga a crook? This was the question that 
arose in September 1992, when he was arrested on suspicion of 
cheating in a deal with the confectionery firm "Uzvara." V. 
Selga's background in the highest political circles could be 
observed when he was released from jail thanks to Latvian 
Supreme Council Deputies V. Kalnberzs and V. Steins, who posted 
bail for him. After all, he did not deliver the promised sugar 
for "Uzvara," but the money he had accepted in advance -- 50 
million Latvian rubles -- he only returned a few months later. 
[passage omitted] 
  These operations with the participation of Voldemars Selga, 
together with the Lake Constance story, provide food for thought 
-- what is the nature of the environment in which the trade in 
isotopes in Latvia is occurring? Shady. The house of Victor 
Balulis on Sarma Street, where Eichler was kept after his 
capture, is undoubtedly connected to criminal circles. After 
his return from prison -- in the second half of the 1980's, when 
the cooperative movement began -- V. Selga was connected with 
these circles. Viktors Abakumovs and Aleksandrs Kisels, 
well-known people in the criminal world, were employees of his 
in the "Merkurijs" joint stock company. The first was murdered 
in the fall of 1991, the second was arrested for the second time 
last autumn and confronted with charges of blackmail. Today, it 
would be out-of-fashion to call them bandits, as they are all 
businessmen, doing legal business. However, it can be done in 
various ways -- deals can be fair or shabby, and taxes can be 
paid or ignored... 
  In the West, the deals with rare metals are being watched 
by special services and by police, looking for evidence of 
cheating or blackmail, as well as by financial experts, who look 
for possible instances of "money laundering." In Latvia, 
minimal attention is paid to these problems and there are 
practically no chances for controls of any type. How can grams 
of anything be detected, if there are tons of sugar and flour 
being smuggled over the Latvian border? Still, a few grams of 
isotopes are far more valuable than several tons of sugar... 
Who has ever heard of any Latvian special services stating that 
they are in possession of some information in this respect, for 
instance regarding the production and trade control of isotopes 
in Russia? The story of Rimmele and Eichler provided sufficient 
grounds to begin speaking about it, but it seems that while 
quarreling with each other, there is no time left for such 
things. Can we speak about narrowing down the possibilities to 
"launder" money? Probably not, especially since, to date, any 
attempts by tax inspectors to control cash transactions have 
remained in the realm of dreams. 
  The dangerous thing is that trade in nonradioactive 
materials 
can not be discerned from trade in radioactive materials, which 
are hazardous for human health and life, because both come from 
the same delivery sources. In a secret report by the German 
Federal Intelligence Service on the black market of radioactive 
materials and the threat of radioactive terrorism from the East, 
Kaunas and Vilnius had been mentioned as centers of illegal 
trade. Anyhow, this may be little consolation for Latvia. 
Trading will continue in places where there are few hindrances 
to businessmen. 
  [Published in a box accompanying the article is a copy of a 
letter in English dated 3 February from the Finnish firm 
Wimco-Erica Finland to RDB President Voldemars Selga, reading: 
  "Dear Mr. Selga, 
  "Reconstruction and Development Bank of has issued A Bank 
Guarantee No. 4008/KN/AZ/is, with a value of USD 4,555,000,000 
[previous amount circled] (Four Billion Five Hundred Fifty-Five 
Million). This Bank Guarantee has been issued for the benefit 
of Wimco-Erica Finland for buying Osmium-187. 
  "We have an offer to buy 32.9 kilograms of Osmium-187 in a 
favourable price for USD 64,450 per one gram. The value of the 
transaction is USD 2,120,405,000. As agreed with you and Mr. 
Horst Hamm, Wimco-Erica Finland will pay royalty USD 300 for 
each gram sold. Your bank shall get royalty USD 9.87 millions 
from this delivery. 
  "We ask you to accept Wimco-Erica Finland to use now this 
Bank Guarantee to buy Osmium-187 from Russia. 
  "GENCAR LTD., our marketing partner for Osmium trade. 
[previous sentence underlined] 
  "Marketing of this Osmium has been arranged in cooperation 
with Gencar Limited, a company managed by Mr. Kyoesti Lallukka, 
who is also a Member of Directors in Wimco-Erica Finland." 
  The letter is signed by Horst Hamm, "chairman of the Board 
of 
Directors of Wimco-Erica Finland," and Kyoesti Lallukka, 
"managing director" of Gencar Ltd.; there is place for RDB 
President Voldemars Selga to sign, but his signature does not 
appear.]

<F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Adamishin, Russian first deputy </F>
foreign minister, by Sanobar Shermatova under the "Talks" 
rubric: "Site of Meeting -- Moscow. Tajik Opposition Agreed for 
the First Time To Hold Talks With Government" -- place and date 
not given] 
  [Excerpts] The 6 March meeting of Russian diplomats with 
leaders of the warring Tajikistani opposition in Tehran has 
become an event of primary importance for the CIS' southern 
regions. Anatoliy Adamishin, Russian first deputy foreign 
minister, who headed the Russian delegation, gave an interview 
to Sanobar Shermatova. 
  [Shermatova] Anatoliy Leonidovich, have the talks produced 
any results? 
  [Adamishin] Two basic agreements have been reached. The 
opposition has for the first time agreed to sit down at the 
negotiating table with the government. Earlier, they refused to 
do so, wishing to speak directly to the "masters," as they 
called Moscow. The second point is that they agreed to come to 
Moscow for the first meeting (previously they mentioned Tehran 
or Geneva, fearing Tajik hitmen and being not completely sure 
that they will have adequate security in Moscow). This is 
understandable, given that very recently the Tajikistan 
prosecutor's office ruled that opposition chiefs are guilty and 
launched a search for them. Meanwhile, Tajikistan and Russia 
have an agreement on legal assistance... Before going to 
Tehran, I met with Tajikistan Supreme Soviet Chairman Emomali 
Rakhmanov, who guaranteed the opposition absolute security at 
the talks. [passage omitted] 
  [Shermatova] You met with leaders of the warring opposition 
for the first time. What impression did they produce on you? 
  [Adamishin] Both Mr. Turadzhonzoda and Mr. Khimmatzoda are 
people to talk to. As for former Tajik Foreign Minister 
Khudayberdy Khaliknazarov, I met with him earlier and this is a 
serious person. [passage omitted] 
  [Shermatova] Tightly tied in the Tajik knot are sometimes 
conflicting interests of various circles in Dushanbe, Tashkent, 
Moscow, Kabul, and Tehran. What is your forecast for the 
evolution of events? 
  [Adamishin] I do not expect quick results from the talks; to 
all appearances, they will be difficult and prolonged, all the 
more given the great human suffering and losses sustained by 
both warring sides in Tajikistan. But there is no other way -- 
either talks or further bloodshed. There can be no winners in 
civil war. [passage omitted]

Beijing of Conflict with Armenia"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- One of the main aims of the first visit 
to the PRC by the president of independent Azerbaijan was to 
inform the Chinese leadership of the reasons for the war with 
Armenia. G. Aliyev stated this at a press conference in Beijing. 
  The Chinese leaders listened politely to their guest and 
expressed sympathy but went no further than calling for a 
peaceful settlement of the conflict. China, as a permanent 
member of the UN Security Council, prefers to maintain 
neutrality. Correspondents were interested to know whether 
China had promised to render economic aid to Azerbaijan. It 
follows from the president's reply that relations between the 
two countries will be built on a mutually advantageous basis and 
there was therefore no talk of China's economic aid.

  [Text] On 8 March, Stanislav Shushkevich, ex-speaker of the 
Belarusian Supreme Soviet, visited Soligorsk. Regardless of the 
holiday, city residents filled the Miners' Palace of Culture to 
almost full capacity. The ex-speaker declined to 
straightforwardly answer questions from the audience of whether 
his recent trips to Belarusian cities mark the beginning of his 
presidential campaign. However, he did say that democratic 
forces in the Republic should nominate a single candidate for 
the upcoming elections to secure a greater probability of 
victory. Stanislav Shushkevich also spoke positively of the 
unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems, as 
well as of the economic achievements of the Baltic countries. 
Despite discontent with the policy of the government and 
Supreme Soviet, the former Supreme Soviet chairman spoke against 
a political strike with plant and factory stoppages.

  [Text] The head of the State Duma, the lower house of the 
Russian parliament, Ivan Rybkin, and the chairmen of the State 
Duma International Affairs and Defense Committees, Vladimir 
Lukin and Sergey Yushenkov, have met U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Perry. 
  Yushenkov told Interfax the meeting, which took place in the 
Pentagon on Tuesday and lasted an hour, had focused on the 
possibility of Russia's participation in NATO's Partnership for 
Peace program, seen as a preparatory stage for membership of the 
North Atlantic alliance. 
  Perry "did not deny that the program provides for the future 
standardization of weapons according to NATO technology," 
Yushenkov said. He believes that, in view of this and since 
"the framework agreements were drawn up without our 
participation and do not conform to the status of Russia," the 
State Duma must protest against Russia's joining the program, 
despite the fact that most East European countries have either 
joined it or stated their intent to do so. 
  But there was complete mutual understanding on the other two 
issues, the situation in the former Yugoslavia and the future 
ratification of the START-II treaty, Yushenkov said. It was 
also agreed that Perry would meet State Duma members during his 
end-of-March visit to Moscow.

  [Text] Russia is due to start dismantling two nuclear 
reactors in Paldiski on the Estonian coast in just under a 
month's time. The Estonian Environment Minister Andres Tarand 
says that experts are ready for this. It is believed that the 
dismantling of the fuel rods will take three months. Tarand 
suspects, however, that Russia may start slowing down the 
dismantling of the nuclear reactors. Tarand says that because of 
difficulties that have emerged in the negotiations between 
Estonia and Russia, Russia may think of some pretexts to delay 
the start of the work.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 08, BNS -- Russia would like to carry 
out military transit through Lithuanian territory by road, by 
rail and by air, Virgilijus Bulovas, head of the Lithuanian 
working group for talks with CIS, told Lithuanian TV Monday [7 
March]. 
  The group announced after its meeting Monday that the 
Russian 
draft agreement on military transit should be discussed only 
when the parliament adopts a law on transportation of military 
and dangerous cargos through Lithuanian territory. 
  Commenting on the Russian draft, Bulovas said Lithuanian 
experts suggest to allow only transit by rail. In his words, 
transit by road is completely unacceptable to Lithuania, while 
transit by air can be carried out only in accordance with 
international regulations and requires separate permission of 
the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry. 
  In Bulovas' opinion, Lithuania cannot create any specific 
regulations for Russian military transit. "The rules will be 
universal to all, be it Russia or NATO." The negotiator said his 
group is now working on regulations of transporting dangerous 
cargos by rail through Lithuania. 
  Bulovas noted that Lithuania does not have two borders with 
Russia, therefore it will be necessary either to sign a 
trilateral agreement between Lithuania, Russia and Belarus, or 
to conclude three separate bilateral agreements. 
  Bulovas said Russia has lately begun intensive transit by 
sea. In his words, the process is evident because the amount of 
transit by rail is considerably smaller than planned.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 08, BNS -- The Latvian Saeima 
(parliament) Defense and Interior Affairs' Committee discussed 
Tuesday [8 March] compensations for families whose supporters 
have perished during the mandatory armed service in the former 
Soviet army. 
  Around 200 such families need material assistance in Latvia, 
according to figures at the disposal of the committee. 
  The committee decided to send the collected files for 
Cabinet 
consideration, said its secretary Anita Stankevica. 
  The necessary funding could be demanded from Russia during 
bilateral talks or the Latvian Government could allot the money 
from the state budget, the committee said. 
  The future task of the committee is to gather information 
about people who were crippled while in the Soviet Army. Then, 
the group will contact assistance funds in Germany which offer 
financial help to Latvian citizens disabled in the Soviet Army.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Prokopenko: "`Pocket' Armies Hard on the </F>
Pocket. Servicemen from Nearby Foreign Countries Set on Coming 
to Russia"] 
  [Text] It appears that national armies are becoming a 
national disaster for the independent states of the post-Union 
space. In fact, the last thing politicians who gained points 
and earned dividends from the idea of independence are bothered 
about now is the future of the very armies they advocated 
creating. They were necessary merely as an essential attribute 
of embryonic statehood. But when the once common "blanket" was 
torn up, it turned out that the shreds would not even cover the 
private parts, if you will excuse the expression. The units 
which were once the subject of fierce polemics are in a dire 
state. For example, the regiment of ultramodern Tu-160 
strategic bombers, which were once "privatized" with such pomp 
and ceremony by Ukraine. While they have been under yellow and 
blue banners, the regiment's pilots have hardly ever been up in 
the air. 
  For the umpteenth time the military are pawns in political 
games. The recent flood of requests for transfer to national 
armies has dried up. The lack of proper social guarantees and 
the threat of professional degeneration altered the direction of 
migration. Now the cadre departments of the Russian Army's main 
commissariats are snowed under with letters in which officers 
from nearby foreign parts are expressing their willingness to 
serve anywhere and in any posts. 
  For instance, 800 military pilots have left the Belarusian 
Armed Forces and are now serving in Russia. They constituted 60 
percent of the Belarusian Air Force flight personnel. Also 
badly weakened by the mass "exodus to Russia" are the Belarusian 
Airborne Assault Forces, 339 of whose officers have changed 
their place of service in this way. According to the republic 
committee for the social protection of servicemen, another 2,500 
officers want to go to Russia. 
  Clearly, the independent states cannot afford to keep 
armies. 
Moreover, one cannot expect economic progress and a 
corresponding easing of the crisis in these armed formations in 
the foreseeable future.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Nadein: "Kravchuk and Shevardnadze </F>
Asked for Money in Washington, While Rybkin Got Acquainted With 
the Center of International Imperialism"] 
  [Text] Washington -- In less than a week the leaders of 
three countries that sprang from the ruins of the former Soviet 
Union visited Washington. They flew there for various purposes 
and with very dissimilar opportunities available to them, and 
hence it is quite impossible to assess by the same yardstick the 
success or failure of Ukraine's Leonid Kravchuk, Georgia's 
Eduard Shevardnadze, and Russia's Ivan Rybkin. 
  This extreme closeness in time and space allows us to see 
more clearly which of its interests -- and in what way -- the 
last superpower is pursuing in that vast area that only recently 
was unfriendly, and which today is no longer hostile, is not yet 
friendly, and is -- it is not clear exactly what. 
  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, who for a long time was 
regarded in Washington as more or less persona non grata because 
of his stubborn refusal to acknowledge the legality of 
agreements on nuclear missile disarmament which he himself had 
signed, wanted not only to make a good impression, but to win 
the hearts of his sensitive hosts. That was why he took along 
Olympic figure skating champion Oksana Bayul, in whose company 
he went to the White House. This original idea proved 
surprisingly inconvenient. President Clinton had been too busy 
to meet with the Olympic champions among his own compatriots. 
For the U.S. President to receive Oksana, albeit as one of a 
state delegation, was a mistake which, ridiculous as it seems, 
could cost him many votes. 
  The president of Ukraine, in whose territory, unfortunately, 
there is not much oil or gas, has reached the point of needing 
to trade in the only commodity he has which has export value: 
Ukraine's geopolitical location. He told the Americans that a 
strong and independent Ukraine could be an important buffer 
against any expansionist urges on Russia's part. 
  In the absence of any clear laws on the protection of 
foreign 
capital, Kravchuk sought to entice businesspeople to try their 
hands in the renewed Ukraine -- on the strength of his firm word 
as president. The participants in the New York meetings raised 
no objection aloud, but all the same they were thinking of L. 
Kravchuk's remark to the effect that he does not intend to be a 
candidate in the presidential elections to be held in the summer. 
  Politicians who are serving out their term without hope are 
known in America as "lame ducks," or, as we would put it, winged 
birds. This duality probably annoyed Kravchuk, who expressed 
the view, at one press conference, that Ukraine has more 
pressing matters on hand now than the presidential elections. 
  Eduard Shevardnadze, head of Georgia: cordial but imperious, 
a little tired, but indefatigable, M.S. Gorbachev's loyal 
associate, has been to Washington and to Andrews Air Base many 
times. 
  Speaking on behalf of his country of 5.5 million people, he 
performs miracles of inventiveness, keeping the diplomatic ball 
in the air. While giving Russia, the Russians, and the CIS 
their due, he put two requests to President Clinton. 
  The first, naturally, concerns money. The White House is 
giving $100 million -- taking its possibilities to the limit. 
"Let Shevardnadze ask Congress himself, he will do better (than 
me)" -- President Clinton advised, half-joking, half-serious. 
  Shevardnadze's second request takes a larger view. The 
Georgian leader asked the United States to send U.S. servicemen 
to the border with Abkhazia as part of UN peace-making forces. 
  Clinton, naturally, refused. Point-blank. Whatever you do, 
don't send Americans to fight God knows where and God knows what 
for. But Shevardnadze is not the kind of person to take 
champion sportswomen to meet the President. And nor was he 
about to demand something from Clinton that the latter would 
never do. 
  Shevardnadze wanted the U.S. President to lead a movement in 
the United States for the sending of "Blue Helmets" to Georgia, 
and he got what he wanted. Knowing very well that nothing is 
going to happen in the Caucasus without Russia, Shevardnadze is 
setting about the task of not excluding Russia, but ensuring 
international monitoring of its necessary and inevitable 
involvement in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. This kind of 
monitoring is only possible if the United Nations takes on the 
role of maintaining peace-making forces. 
  Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the Russian Duma, showed that the 
communist devil is not as black as he is painted, because he is 
no longer a communist at all, but a regular social democrat like 
the ones in Sweden or Austria. 
  That is what many American newspapers said about the 
chairman 
of the State Duma, while the capital's WASHINGTON POST devoted 
an enthusiastic article to him, by its Moscow correspondent, 
describing the parliamentary speaker as a man who is capable, by 
means of his calmness, of restoring many people's confidence in 
his powers. 
  Describing the long walks to school by the little boy in the 
countryside, and then his work on the kolkhoz, that newspaper 
says that the 47-year-old former Volgograd Oblast CPSU Committee 
secretary is most reminiscent of Abraham Lincoln, the celebrated 
American president, who was a woodcutter in his youth. 
  The urbane, smiling speaker confidently denied charges that 
his Agrarian Party harbors antireform sentiments, sought to 
demonstrate that the Duma is ready and willing to cooperate with 
the president, and, most important, reaffirmed again and again 
his commitment to the foreign policy line which only recently 
was seen as probably Andrey Kozyrev's most heinous crime -- the 
line of partnership and cooperation with the United States.

<F P=106> [Oleg Zolotov report under the "Here Is the News as Reported </F>
by TRUD Correspondents and News Agency Correspondents" rubric: 
"It Depends on Ukraine Itself"] 
  [Text] So far Ukraine's admission to the CIS economic 
union as an associate member has run into serious problems. And 
although the relevant agreements were reached at the meeting in 
Ashgabat, according to a number of experts the prospect of 
admission is in doubt. 
  Now the latest session of the CIS Coordinating Consultative 
Committee has opened in Moscow. 
  "In principle the question has already been resolved," 
TRUD's 
correspondent was told by Ukrainian Embassy Minister-Counselor 
Vladimir Fedorov. "The only thing being discussed now is the 
terms." 
  But I. Korotchenya, executive secretary of the CIS 
Coordinating Consultative Committee, has a completely different 
opinion. 
  "This question was still being worked on in Minsk," he 
recounts. "At the moment it is too complex to admit Ukraine. 
The republic has not signed the economic union's charter." 
  Immediately after the end of the session, TRUD's 
correspondent asked Committee Chairman A. Shokhin to comment on 
the situation. 
  "Today we approved the idea of joining and even the draft 
agreement on Ukraine's admission," he remarked. "The time this 
process will take depends on the republic itself."

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 11 TASS -- NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on 
President Yeltsin's meeting with representatives of state, 
public and business circles of Russia: "President Boris 
Yeltsin's meeting with representatives of 'state, public and 
business circles of Russia' was somewhat strange if only because 
it was not attended by people not only from the 
liberal-democratic party but also those from the party of 
Russian Unity and Accord (PRES) and the Yabloko bloc. 
  "PRES leader Sergey Shakhray had received an invitation, but 
since he is now away on a business trip, other PRES 
representatives were not invited, Sergey Stankevich told the 
newspaper's correspondent. 
  "Mr. Stankevich said the meeting had been organised in 
principle to reconcile the ultra wings of the political 
spectrum, although it is difficult to agree that the communists, 
agrarians and sectoral trade unions, on the one hand, and 
Russia's Choice and independent trade unions, on the other, can 
be viewed as such. 
  "Grigoriy Yavlinsky was not invited, maybe, because he does 
not represent any of the ultra forces. Mr. Yavlinsky treated 
this calmly, remarking that it was somehow strange to summon 
people to reach some accord on the next day after the 
president's meeting with the U.S. ex-president was cancelled 
because the latter permitted himself to meet with opposition 
figures". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article by Aleksey Vasilyev, 
director of the Institute of African Studies of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences, who believes that "Islamic Fundamentalism" 
does not pose real danger to Russia. There are other dangers, 
though, namely, that of extremism if the crisis, both the 
socio-economic and inter-ethnic one, continues to intensify, the 
danger of a rise in the threshold of non-receptivity of 
information and of the loss of ability for a dialogue." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an interview with President 
Suleyman 
Demirel of Turkey. He said in particualr as follows: "In 
Russia, there are many people discontented with the break-up of 
the Soviet Union, dissatisfied with the fact that the republics 
of Central Asia, the Transcaucasus and eastern European 
countries are no longer within Russia's sphere of influence. 
  "They believe that a new Russia should be created within the 
borders of the former Soviet Union. It is only natural that 
this is the subject of concern for many countries, not only 
Turkey. If Russia is going to become an imperialist state, it 
would shake others' confidence in itself. 
  "If this happens, that would be undoubtedly a blow to many 
countries which would view Russia as a threat... If we maintain 
peace and cooperation, that would be of benefit to both Russia 
and other countries". 
  ROSSIISKIE VESTI on food quality in Russia: 
  "Over the past three years, the food quality situation has 
become particularly exacerbated. In Russia as a whole, 
bacteriological inspections revealed that from 12 to 15 per cent 
of dairy products, fish and fish products, and from 7 to 10 per 
cent of meat products did not meet standard requirements. 
  "In some regions, the percentage is twice as high. Even with 
such an acute situation, legislative and legal standards fail to 
promote food safety. A number of essential laws have not been 
adopted up to now and some standards have not been even drawn 
up". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the radioactive contamination issue: 
  "Last year, about 237,000 people, who live in the areas of 
radioactive contamination (as a result of the breakdown at the 
Chernobyl nuclear power station -- note by ITAR-TASS) were 
examined. Fifty-eight per cent of adults and 72 per cent of 
children from among those examined turned out to be seriously 
ill". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the cost of services: 
  "Since the beginning of the year, the cost of every-day 
services for the population of Russia has almost doubled. 
Housing rent rose by 84 per cent, hot water supply by 58 per 
cent, the cost of some types of medical services by 18-28 per 
cent and consumer services by 12-26 per cent". 
  TRUD carries an interview with Sergey Samoilov, deputy chief 
of the Territorial Development Department of the administration 
of the Russian president. 
  Samoilov stated: "One is put on one's guard by a high 
activity of opposition political forces that seek at all costs 
to take a dominant position in power bodies, using the election 
campaign (in the regions -- note by ITAR-TASS) to discredit the 
presidential policy of reforms. 
  "Most regions have a rather tense socio-political situation, 
which is sure to tell on voters' turnout, questioning the 
possibility of holding elections in a number of regions within 
the time-limit stipulated by decrees, or will affect the quality 
of the elections. This applies to areas in the far north and 
Magadan region". 
  ST. PETERSBURG GAZETTE reports that the German Lufthansa air 
company broadens the sphere of its influence in the Russian air 
transportation sector. 
  Lufthansa now runs flights from St Petersburg to Hamburg and 
Frankfurt-am-Main, and will soon introduce regular flights from 
Pulkovo to Munich every Saturday. The cheapest round-trip 
ticket costs 565 U.S. dollars.

an agreement with their Uzbek counterparts on the regulation of 
debt settlements and terms in 1992-1993. Under this agreement, 
Uzbekistan acknowledges its $13.98 million debt to our republic. 
This debt has been transferred to a state loan which Uzbekistan 
will begin repaying as of 1 January 1995.

Involved in Legal Action"] 
  [Text] Yesterday marked the end to the 10-day deadline for 
filing appeals against the ruling by the Shchelkovo court, which 
deemed the elections in the Shchelkovo electoral district to be 
invalid. It is well known that Mr. Zhirinovskiy was elected to 
the State Duma in the district. His lawyer, S. Belyak, said 
that Zhirinovskiy was not involved in the criminal proceedings 
either as an interested person or as a plaintiff, hence, he did 
not have the right to appeal. According to S. Belyak, Vladimir 
Volfovich learned about the trial only from newspapers. 
  It seems that the case will come to the attention of an 
oblast court: the district electoral commission, against which 
the complaint was actually lodged, did file an appeal. V.V. Zh. 
[Zhirinovskiy] has left a statement at the oblast court 
objecting to the Shchelkovo city court's ruling and requesting 
that he be invited to attend the trial as an interested 
observer. According to S. Belyak, rumors about that have 
reached Nikolay Ryabov, whose reaction was strongly negative: 
Zhirinovskiy's lawyer quoted him as saying that "if everyone 
who failed to enter the State Duma turns to arbitration courts, 
there will be anarchy in the country!"

<F P=106> [Yuriy Kukanov report under the "Elections in the Regions" </F>
rubric: "Competing `City Fathers' Collect Signatures"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg -- Approximately 750 contenders for 
the title of city fathers are set to contest the 50 deputies' 
mandates in St. Petersburg's new organ of representative power 
at the 20 March elections. Out of 36 electoral blocs, a mere 17 
have succeeded in passing through the pre-election sieve by 
collecting 35,000 signatures each. One of them, the 
Russian-Baltic "Common Sense" bloc, was disqualified at the 
start: 3,000 of the signatures supporting it were deemed 
invalid. Certain individuals demonstrated enviable initiative 
by subscribing to various electoral blocs and putting forward 
their candidacy in several districts at once. 
  The City Assembly will probably be an all-male club: There 
are just 90 women among those hungry for power in the Northern 
Palmira. The overwhelming majority of candidates are civil 
servants, businessmen, and teachers from higher educational 
establishments and schools. Representatives of the creative 
intelligentsia and the mass media have expressed no particular 
enthusiasm. 
  As the election date draws closer, so the third estate's 
troubles increase. Legal wrangles between Federation Council 
Deputy Aleksandr Belyayev and Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak continue. 
The mayor has conceded and repealed the restriction on 
Federation Council members in the Statute on Elections to the 
City Assembly. The senator did not turn up for the most recent 
court hearing, so it was postponed once again. 
  Rudolf Kagramanov, chairman of the officially registered 
anti-bureaucratic party, continues to amuse the public. He 
brought an action against the Electoral Commission because not 
all of his 13 offices and titles were entered on the 
subscription list. One of these titles, for instance, is doctor 
of sensationalist sciences. The chief campaigner against 
bureaucracy collected just one signature in support of his bloc 
-- his own. The suspicion is that Kagramanov's party and the 
electoral bloc combined have the same number of members. The 
only thing that is unclear is what can be going through the 
minds of the earnest people who are allowing this entire farce 
into the elections. 
  At times, the election campaign on the banks of the Neva 
River assumes criminal overtones. Unknown persons savagely beat 
up Petr Soshenko, leader of the group supporting Vice Mayor 
Vyacheslav Shcherbakov. The activist received repeated 
telephone calls and demands to stop campaigning. Local 
detectives are still looking for the culprits. 
  A sensational report was disseminated by the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service St. Petersburg Directorate Press 
Service. Staffers at the department for combating terrorism 
together with criminal investigation workers have detained four 
people suspected of murder. Among them is Nikolay Bondarik, 
chairman of the local branch of the Russian Party. He is 
running for election to the City Assembly on behalf of the 
"Great Russia" bloc, which unites national-patriotic 
organizations. 
  Observers predict that the main struggle for seats in the 
City Assembly will unfold between the "Democratic Unity of 
Petersburg" bloc, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, 
and the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]. Let me 
remind you that in December's Federal Assembly elections the 
liberal democrats won fewer votes in the city on the Neva than 
in other regions of Russia. Commenting upon this fact during 
his recent visit to St. Petersburg, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy stated 
that here, apart from the homeless and the mafia, under which 
category he classed scientists, lawyers, and artists, nobody 
voted for "Russia's Choice." As for voters worthy of the LDPR, 
they are few and far between in the northern capital. 
  Data from the St. Petersburg Sociological Scientific 
Research 
Center is interesting in this connection. In December the LDPR 
won 17 percent of the electorate's votes on the banks of the 
Neva. But according to the results of a city-wide telephone 
sample poll conducted at the end of January, only 9 percent of 
respondents gave an affirmative answer to the following 
question: "Will the success of Zhirinovskiy's party at the 
parliamentary elections help to improve matters in Russia?" 
Admittedly, it is still too early to conclude from this that 
the voters are starting to rid themselves of the liberal 
democratic charms. However, sociologists do record certain 
improvements in the public consciousness. So it is that, 
according to information produced by the poll, only 
three-fourths of the electorate would vote today as they did 12 
December. Of those polled, 10 percent are not sure that they 
would make the same choice as before. And 7 percent would vote 
differently.

<F P=106> [INTERFAX report: "More Entrepreneurs Please:"] </F>
  [Text] A sharp upsurge in unemployment is expected in 
Moscow in 1994, and as early as mid-year roughly 600,000 people 
can expect to be out of work. This was the focal point of a 
session of the Committee for Assisting in the Search for 
Employment under the capital's government. 
  It was noted that at present the city employment service has 
40,000 job vacancies for the 16,000 officially registered 
unemployed in Moscow. Many of these, however, do not want to 
find a job because of miserly wages, increased demands by 
employers, and the simple fact of uninteresting work. 
  The capital's government has drawn up a number of measures 
capable of averting a sharp increase in unemployment in Moscow. 
Among other things, training for entrepreneurs seeking to set up 
their own businesses has been started for the first time.

  [Text] Talks with Chechnya will take place if Chechnya 
observes two terms advanced by Moscow. First, Chechnya must 
stop accusing Moscow of imperial ambitions and, second, the 
talks must be guided by the agreement on the divisions of powers 
already signed between Russia and Tatarstan, an informed source 
in the Russian president's staff told Interfax on Thursday. He 
said that Groznyy has yet to respond. 
  He also noted that the Russian leadership was not planning 
to 
hold parallel talks with the Groznyy officials and the Chechen 
opposition. In experts' estimate, parallel talks could 
strengthen the position of Ruslan Khasbulatov, who is currently 
staying in Chechnya and who is the shadow leader of the 
opposition. Ruslan Khasbulatov, who was recently released from 
Lefortovo prison, currently lives in his native village of 
Tolstoy Yurt near Groznyy. 
  To quote this source, talks will begin after Chechnya 
accepts 
Moscow's terms. The Russian delegation will be led by Chief of 
the president's Staff Sergey Filatov and the Chechen delegation 
by Chechen State Secretary Aslanbek Akbulatov.

  [Text] Some media, with reference to the opinion of foreign 
observers, reported that the election held in Kazakhstan was not 
democratic. Our correspondent met Talgatbek Abaidildin, a 
member of the Central Election Commission, and asked him to 
clarify this information. This is what he said: 
  [Begin Abaidildin recording] In our republic there were 
10,224 polling stations. Foreign observers visited about 30 of 
them, mainly in the city of Almaty, the town of Kapchagay 
[Almaty Oblast]. In my opinion, it is at least unethical on the 
part of observers to draw conclusions that the election in the 
republic of Kazakhstan was not democratic. When we spoke to the 
journalists, their group did not have unanimous opinions. For 
instance, I can show written references from other observers 
that testify to the opposite. They say that the election in 
Kazakhstan was democratic. Yes, we did have some facts of 
negligence, even transgression at some polling stations. 
Currently the Central Election Commission is taking measures. 
If the [election] code has been violated, we might hold results 
obtained at these stations as invalid. Our foreign observers, 
on the whole, expressed their gratitude to the president of the 
republic and to the Foreign Ministry, as well as to the Central 
Election Commission for this invitation and for the official 
possibility given to them. We are not hiding anything from 
them. This attitude disarmed them. When coming here, they 
thought that Kazakhstan's sovereignty is very new, this is the 
first ever election code and there might be many discrepancies. 
I might be mistaken but they certainly had some prejudices. 
But they saw for themselves that we are open, we speak openly 
at all levels, literally. This has disarmed them. Yesterday 
evening we talked to the head of the CSCE group and he said that 
they would pass on to us some of their wishes, but in general 
they are satisfied with their visits to the polling stations and 
the procedural side of the election. But [word indistinct] it 
turned out to be different. I do not think there were any 
serious transgressions or any remarks about serious mistakes 
made. But in any case we will work on these remarks in order to 
avoid such mistakes in future. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 47 (537): </F>
Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] "The parliamentary elections conducted in Kazakhstan 
on March 7th were the most democratic and just, considering the 
socio-economic and political conditions prevailing in the young 
sovereign state," the chairman of the Central Electoral 
Commission, Karatay Turysov, told Interfax. "There are no 
reasons for cancelling the election results or for recognizing 
them as null and void," he stressed. 
  According to Turysov, observers from the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), who criticized the 
election system and pointed to a number of violations in the 
course of voting, have not informed him of their conclusions 
officially, and therefore he finds it impossible to comment on 
"what he knows by hearsay." 
  IF Note: The conclusion that Monday's elections were 
"undemocratic" was voiced at a news conference in Almaty by a 
spokesperson for the CSCE bureau for democratic institutions and 
human rights, Elizabeth Winship. She thinks this was largely 
because political parties, movements and candidates did not have 
enough time to organize the election campaign, and because the 
system of registering party candidates was confused. According 
to the CSCE spokesperson, during the elections some voters cast 
ballots for several people; some lists of voters were in 
duplicate; some ballots were substituted by commission members. 
CSCE experts also noted violations on the part of officials 
from the Central Electoral Commission, who revoked independent 
candidates under different pretexts, and pressure exerted on 
district commissions by local administration officials. 
Besides, CSCE experts believe that the list of candidates 
compiled by the president "ensured 20% of parliament 
seats for 
people from government structures from the outset". 
  As the Central Electoral Commission chairman said, the 
so-called "presidential list" of candidates for parliamentary 
elections (64 persons), which was criticized by international 
observers, had been submitted in accordance with the electoral 
code. It included prominent writers, scientists and economists, 
"and very few representatives of government structures." 
  Having conceded that abuses did take place in the course of 
elections -- a man cast ballots for his entire family, for 
instance -- Turysov pointed out that they cannot serve as 
grounds for cancelling the election results. Several 
commissions have been formed to inspect concrete statements 
concerning violations. 
  The elections were attended by 125 observers from France, 
Germany, Russia, Kyrgyzstan and other countries, Turysov 
stressed. They all evaluated the elections positively. 
  When asked if Kazakhstan will invite CSCE observers to its 
next elections, Turysov said that the CSCE is an authoritative 
organization, and Almaty will undoubtedly send invitations to 
its observers.

  [Text] Today an agreement was signed between the 
governments of Kazakhstan and Japan with regard to cooperation 
in elimination of the nuclear weapons due to be dismantled in 
the Republic of Kazakhstan as well as setting up of a 
cooperation committee for this purpose. The document was signed 
by Foreign Minister Tuleutay Suleymenov and the Ambassador of 
Japan to Kazakhstan. This is a comment given by the Kazakh 
minister : 
  [Begin Suleymenov recording] We have signed an agreement 
with 
[word indistinct] and the Lisbon Protocol in accordance with 
which we are a part of an agreement [words indistinct] weapons 
which we have inherited from the former USSR. 
  We need tremendous sums of money for which our young 
republic 
has no finance, and our economy can not cope with it. The 
agreement we have just signed represents good will on the part 
of the Japanese government and the Japanese nation who put 
forward this initiative to Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and 
Kazakhstan and which want to render financial assistance, to 
participate in the process of elimination of nuclear weapons 
located on these territories. 
  The Japanese government is allocating a total of about $100 
million for all four states -- for Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, 
and Belarus. Kazakhstan was the last to sign this agreement. 
In the near future, at the end of this month, the Japanese 
government will examine the matter. The share to be received by 
each country will depend on the decision taken by the Japanese 
government. We cannot say now whether these shares will be 
equal. It will depend on the country, on the type of nuclear 
weapons in these states, and the expenses connected with 
dismantling. [words indistinct] 
  Besides, it is essential for Kazakhstan that this agreement 
envisages facilitation in tackling relevant environmental 
problems in the area of deployment and testing of nuclear 
weapons. In particular, this relates to the Semipalatinsk 
region. 
  In the second half of March a group of experts of the 
Japanese Foreign Ministry is expected to visit Almaty to study 
the problem in full detail and meet relevant ministries and 
departments. This is a positive development on the eve of the 
official visit to Japan by our president in the first 10 days of 
April.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Amangeldy Akhmetalimov and </F>
Gennadiy Kulagin] 
  [Excerpts] Almaty, 10 Mar -- The decisions of the 
Kazakhstan Supreme Council on the setting up of free economic 
zones in some oblasts have been made invalid. An edict to this 
effect was signed by President Nursultan Nazarbayev who was 
granted additional powers by the former parliament until the 
opening of a new parliament. 
  This move was officially explained by the fact that measures 
are being introduced in the republic to streamline and balance 
the budgetary system. Asked by ITAR-TASS if this was a 
deviation from the course of reforms in the economy, 
authoritative experts from the presidential apparatus said that 
the existence of the free economic zones had resulted in 
unbalanced budgets at various levels. [passage omitted] 
  The experts believe that given the grave financial situation 
in the country, it is more expedient to have just limited and 
localized free economic zones. The edict did not affect these.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under "Current News" rubric: "For </F>
Order in the Country"] 
  [Text] The leaders of two influential centrist parties in 
Kyrgyzstan -- the Republican People's Party and the 
"'Kyrgyzstan' Democratic Movement" -- have demanded that the 
republic's authorities resolutely reform the economy and impose 
order in the country. A document made public in Bishkek points 
out that "the extremely grave crisis situation" has made them 
take this step. 
  The parties demand, in particular, that measures be taken to 
halt the production slump, that key state management posts be 
filled by specialists as soon as possible, regardless of their 
nationality or tribal allegiance, and that pensions and benefits 
for the needy be increased. The document also demands that the 
government devote the maximum attention to carrying out spring 
field work.

marks as received] 
  [Text] Bishkek March 10 TASS -- About a hundred of 
picketers, members of the association of Kyrgyz free farmers and 
agricultural enterpreneurs, met in front of the government 
palace in Bishkek today to demand government support for 
President Akayev's decree on free land transactions. They also 
called for cutting short all intervention hampering reforms in 
agriculture. 
  The picketers, who are participants in the congress of the 
association, which opened in the Kyrgyz capital today, decided 
to make their views known to the government and the public on 
the very first day of the gathering. 
  Their representative Askarbek Bazarkulov said "the 
government 
headed by Apas Jumagulov has not justified our confidence, 
because it is only paying lip service to reforms in agriculture. 
  "We ask only one thing -- that they do not interfere with 
our 
activity and give us loans. The 150 million soms (about 15 
million dollars) allocated to agriculture recently has been 
wasted in supporting unviable collective farms, and only ten 
million soms (about 1 million dollars) of that amount of money 
were given to private farmers. 
  "We, free land owners and farmers, have not received 
anything", said Askarbek Bazarkulov, one of the organizers of 
Kyrgyz peasant movement. 
  The congress is expected to raise a question about the 
resignation of the republic's government.

  [Text] We have received a report from Boris Koltsov, our 
special correspondent in Tajikistan, who together with his 
cameraman, Viktor Cherbakov, was at the center of today's events 
in the 13th subunit of the Moscow border detachment. Around 60 
people crossed the border today from the direction of 
Afghanistan. At 0800 local time the border detail went into 
battle, together with a Tajikistan national security detachment. 
The majority of the group were destroyed. 
  It is possible that at 2200 we will receive a report from 
the 
scene. We hope so.

  [Text] As many as six people from a military group of the 
Tajik opposition and Afghan Mojahedins were killed during the 
attempt to break through the Tajik-Afghan border near the 
Eleventh control post of the Moscow Border Guards' detachment on 
Thursday. 
  Well informed sources in Dushanbe told Interfax that a 
military group of about sixty people armed with mortars, 
hand-held infantry anti-tank rocket launchers and automatic 
guns, had tried to cross the Pyanj River. A unit of the Tajik 
Security Ministry resisted the attack. One serviceman of the 
government's forces was wounded. 
  This was the biggest Islamic military group which tried to 
break through the Tajik-Afghan border since the beginning of the 
year. 
  According to military sources, groups of ten to fifteen 
people try to break through to Tajikistan every day. The 
situation may significantly deteriorate in April.

  [Text] Dushanbe, 11 Mar -- Kozidavlat Koimdodov, deputy 
chairman of the republican Supreme Soviet, described the murder 
of Moyonsho Nazarshoyev, deputy chairman of the Tajikistan 
Council of Ministers, as "a planned terrorist act." 
  Let me remind you that the 64-year-old Nazarshoyev, a native 
of Gornyy Badakhshan, was shot with an automatic weapon last 
night by unknown persons, in the courtyard of his own home. 
Twenty bullets were fired at him. The criminals escaped. 
  The deputy parliamentary speaker said today in an exclusive 
interview to an ITAR-TASS correpondent that it was an attempt to 
destabilize the social and political situation in the region, to 
wreck the process of peaceful political dialogue between the 
republic's official authorities and representatives of the 
opposition. 
  A senior source in the Tajik Government, who wishes to 
remain 
anonymous, said in an interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent 
that he does not rule out that there will be a series of 
terrorist and subversive acts in the republic against well-known 
political figures and against the general public in the 
immediate future. He said "a kind of `fifth column' opposition 
exists in the Tajik capital and its suburbs numbering many 
hundreds." Recently, "Tajikistan's special services got hold of 
a coded message from representatives of the so-called 
irreconcilable opposition in Afghanistan recommending that 
terrorist acts against the Tajik leadership be stepped up."

  [Text] The Uzbek Interior Ministry expressed concern over 
what it called "the subversive activities" pursued by 
politicians who had left the country. In a statement made 
public Tuesday the ministry said that "certain megalomaniac 
figures who left Uzbekistan have started attempts at 
destabilizing the republic." 
  "Slanderous literature" on alleged human rights violations 
in 
Uzbekistan is said to be smuggled into the country through 
channels which are used to traffic weapons and narcotic drugs. 
The overall aim, the statement said, is to "discredit the 
policies of the Uzbek leadership and sow panic and ethnic 
tension." 
  The ministry promised to do its best, jointly with other law 
enforcement agencies in the country, to put an end to the 
subversive activities. 
  No names are mentioned in the statement. Leaders of the 
Birlik popular movement, the Erk democratic party and the human 
rights society who have left the country over the last two years 
accuse the Uzbek authorities of having installed a totalitarian 
regime.

  [Text] On Friday in Chisinau, Moldovan President Mircea 
Snegur and Deputy General Director Vilor Venkov of the Russian 
joint stock society Gazprom agreed Moldova would pay what it 
owed Russia for natural gas deliveries. 
  Shipments of high quality farm produce would take care of 30 
billion rubles and Moldova would have to draw on loans from 
international organizations to pay off the remaining part of the 
126 billion ruble debt. 
  To avert the repetition of what had happened, action must be 
taken to enforce, at last, the Commonwealth's economic accord. 
President Snegur suggested that the next Commonwealth summit 
remove all the barriers between the former Soviet republics.

  [Text] The Moldovan Security Council welcomed the 
initiative of Moldovan President Mircea Snegur to sign the NATO 
program Partnership for Peace in Brussels on March 16. 
  Speaking at the council's meeting, the president stressed 
that this program did not contradict the Declaration on 
Independence and Sovereignty of Moldova and the results of the 
sociological poll on the sovereignty of Moldova. "These 
documents provide for cooperation between all countries of the 
world in many ways," he emphasized. 
  Snegur also pointed out that the intention of Moldova to 
neutrality must not isolate it before possible political or 
other cataclysms. According to him, the signing of the NATO 
program did not mean that Moldova would immediately reorientate 
itself to the West. "Our economic and political priorities will 
remain the same -- enlargement of mutually beneficial relations 
with all countries of the world, including the CIS republics," 
the president reassured.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 47 (537): </F>
Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] President Mircea Snegur is convinced that "most 
people want to take part in building an independent and 
sovereign state" as indicated by last Sunday's poll results. 
  IF Note: More than 95 percent of Moldovans voted in favor of 
the country's statehood and sovereignty in the Sunday poll as 
compared to a mere 2 percent who were against. 2.6 percent of 
ballot papers were invalidated. 1.8 Mn people or 75.1 percent 
of those eligible to vote were involved in the poll to answer a 
single question: "Do you agree that Moldova should develop as an 
independent, integral and indivisible state within the borders 
that existed on June 23, 1990 (the day it proclaimed 
independence from Moscow) and pursuing neutral policies, 
maintaining cooperation with all other countries and 
guaranteeing its citizens equal rights in keeping with 
international law". 
  Leader of the Agrarian Democratic Party [ADP] Aurel 
Tolmatskiy believes the poll results create a solid basis for 
the new parliament's activity. 
  In an interview with Interfax, he said "the need to consult 
the nation on key issues of the republic's development so as to 
put an end to the manipulation of public opinion is long 
overdue". Tolmatsky said the poll results were an indication 
that most people were supportive of the policy aimed at 
consolidating the republic's statehood, independence and 
integrity. 
  He stressed that this was completely in line with the 
position taken by his party which won 55 out of 104 seats in the 
new parliament in last month's election, while the Sunday poll 
reaffirmed support to ADP policies. 
  On Snegur's suggestion on giving the poll the status of a 
referendum, Tolmatskiy said the new legislature might well adopt 
such a resolution. However, he said that this in itself was 
less important than learning the real mood on the ground so as 
to get on with the work in hand by leaning upon the nation's 
support.

of the Nagorno-Karabakh Supreme Soviet spread the text of appeal 
to the international law-defending and peace-making 
organizations to contribute to influence the Azerbaijani 
authorities to immediately stop killing Armenians taken by 
Azeris as the POW and hostages. 
  Gayane Arustamyan, Press-Secretary of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
Supreme Soviet, told SNARK Azerbaijan is always violating the 
international conventions demonstrating inhuman attitude to the 
POW and hostages. 
  Ms. Arustamyan mentions the facts of non-extraditions of 
bodies of those Armenians who were killed in prisons of 
Azerbaijan, bringing as an example the case of Hrachik 
Petrosyan, born in 1954, died as a result of tortures on January 
5, 1994, in Baku. 
  The Azerbaijani authorities, underlines Ms. Arustamyan, 
prevent the representatives of International Red Cross to get 
acquainted with the conditions the POW and hostages live in. In 
connection with it the international control should be organized 
to keep strictly the rights of the POW and hostages.

  [Text] Stepanakert, March 10 (SNARK)--The Republic of 
Nagorno-Karabakh comes out for the immediate cease of fire and 
the beginning of constructive negotiations on peaceful 
settlement of the conflict, the effective guarantees of 
non-resumption of hostilities provided, told SNARK today the 
temporary Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Nagorno-Karabakh 
Karen Baburyan. 
  However the latest political moves of Azerbaijani leaders 
testify, in his words, that official Baku still relies on force 
methods of solving the problem, which is equally bad for the 
Armenian and Azerbaijani people. 
  This, continued the Head of Karabakh Parliament, can be 
proved by such facts, as torpedoing of Russian and CSCE peaceful 
initiatives, intensive buying-in of arms, using of foreign 
mercenaries and military instructors. Such a policy of Baku, 
stressed Baburyan, does not in the least serve the cause of 
peace in the region. Moreover, it can, in his opinion, lead to 
serious destabilization of the situation in Azerbaijan itself.

  [Text] The Catholicos of All the Armenians Vazgen I sent a 
letter to President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrosyan in which he 
expressed his concern and anguish over the Karabakh war, which 
is exacting enormous losses both from among the Armenian freedom 
fighters defending Karabakh and from the Azerbaijanis. 
  The Armenian patriarch notes that during his meeting with 
Azerbaijan's Sheikh-ul-Islam Pashazade in Switzerland and then 
in Moscow, they issued a joint statement calling on the 
conflicting sides to end the war. However, that call has so far 
produced no result. The Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch 
Aleksiy II sent a letter to the Catholicos with the same 
comments. 
  At the conclusion of his letter to the Armenian president, 
the Catholicos of All the Armenians writes: This is the mission 
that we are trying to fulfill by writing this letter to you and 
to our fatherland's government, by calling on you, Mr. 
president, to avail yourself of your prestigious position and 
act as a mediator to assist in the peaceful resolution of the 
distressful Karabakh problem. We believe that this is also the 
wish of our afflicted people living in the fatherland. We 
wholeheartedly wish patriotic energy and noble inspiration to 
you and to the Republic's government and parliament to reach the 
harbor of peace. 
  [Signed] With blessings, Vazgen I, the Catholicos of All the 
Armenians.

  [Text] According to Associated Press, Ukraine has announced 
that it is suspending the dispatch to Russia of nuclear warheads 
from missiles on its territory. 
  The agency cites a Ukrainian Defense Ministry statement 
issued on Friday [11 March]. Justifying this step, the 
Ukrainian ministry has accused the Russian media of 
disseminating confidential information on the transportation of 
the warheads from the Ukrainian territory into Russia. This is 
seen by the Ukrainian military as a threat to the safety of the 
nuclear materials due to be transported. 
  It was earlier reported that the first nuclear trainload 
arrived in Russia last Sunday.

  [Text] Today our correspondents interviewed Ukrainian 
Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko, who was in our delegation 
during the official visit to the United States by President 
Leonid Kravchuk. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Anatoliy 
Maksymovych, what can you say about the foreign policy results 
of the visit to the United States by Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk? 
  [Zlenko] Summing up this visit, I would like to say first of 
all that in general a positive atmosphere preceded this visit. 
This positive atmosphere was created by the signing of the 
trilateral statement on 14 January between the United States, 
Ukraine, and Russia. Naturally, to a certain extent this too 
affected both the course of the visit itself and the results of 
this visit. 
  However, if one is to speak about the main foreign policy 
results of this visit, then it seems to me that, first of all 
this visit made it possible to convince ourselves that a 
noticeable change has occurred in Ukrainian-U.S. relations, a 
change in relations on the part of the United States toward 
Ukraine being a friendly state, one capable of playing a 
stabilizing role in the region -- I would even say that 
according to some publications of the U.S. press, a state that 
could play a significant role at the crossroads of Europe and 
Asia. 
  I would like to say that one may view as another main result 
of this visit the fact that the United States unambiguously 
stated its support for Ukraine's political and economic 
independence. The violation of this, say, important principle 
of support, as was said, could affect the strategic balance of 
the dislocation of forces in Europe. This visit and its 
outcome, its important or significant political results, were 
reached not at the expense of and not to the detriment of any 
state. [end recording]

bound for Cuba. This consignment of humanitarian aid has been 
put together by several governmental and public organizations in 
Ukraine, notably the young people's fund "Children of

  [Text] A meeting was held in the Kremlin today between 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and representatives of various 
public movements, the Federation Council, Duma factions, and the 
government. It was devoted to preparing a draft memorandum on 
civic accord and peace. Understandably, an issue of this 
importance embraces a whole range of problems, and the crisis in 
the fuel and energy complex may be considered a problem of the 
first order. This issue was also discussed at the meeting. On 
the telephone, especially for Mayak, is Aleksandr Sergeyev, 
chairman of the Russian Independent Miners Union. 
  [Sergeyev] The president said that this morning he signed an 
edict on raising the accountability of employers for the 
untimely payment of wages. He demanded that the procuracy and 
courts take effective steps, and observe the legislation, the 
violation of which has taken on massive dimensions in Russia 
too. He also said that it was necessary to take immediate 
measures to stabilize the banking system and turned to 
Chernomyrdin, who was present at this meeting, asking why he was 
taking such a long time to make these decisions. That was just 
the first reaction of the president to what is going on in the 
coal mining regions, and I hope that in the near future edicts 
will be published on raising accountability for nonpayment for 
fuel and nonpayment by coal consumers, and also raising 
accountability for holding up the processing of payments in the 
banking system. At least, I got the impression that the 
government had already prepared these proposals in principle and 
that the question is when it is going to be signed. Despite 
this, however, I still feel that the situation remains very 
critical, and even the middle of March will be very serious. If 
the government does not take measures like these to stabilize 
the economic situation the strikes will take on an even more 
massive and threatening nature.

  [Text] The leader of the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin group in 
the Russian State Duma was not invited to the Thursday Kremlin 
meeting of the president and heads of political parties and 
movements. Talking to journalists in the State Duma Grigoriy 
Yavlinskiy assumed that the president "evidently brought 
together those who did not meet with Richard Nixon." 
  He said Yeltsin's public refusal to receive the former 
American president now staying in Moscow on a private visit, 
after Nixon met several opposition leaders, the ban on Nixon's 
meetings with the government and the head of the presidential 
administration Sergey Filatov, "have nothing even to do with the 
slightest ideas of democracy, loyalty, tolerance or diplomacy." 
  Yavlinskiy also said that the contents of his 
hour-and-a-half 
conversation with the former American head of state on March 8 
"gave no grounds for such a demonstration." 
  According to Yavlinskiy, during their meeting, Nixon 
mentioned that the list of his meetings in Russia had been 
agreed upon with President Clinton. Yavlinskiy said the former 
American president also disagreed with claims that Yeltsin is 
oppressive and undemocratic because Nixon could meet with 
opposition leaders. Nixon said this shows the president is 
confident and is quite broad-minded.

general heading: "Boris Yeltsin Proposes That an Agreement on 
Civil Peace and Accord in Russia Be Signed. However, 
Representatives of PRES, `Yabloko,' and LDPR Were Absent at the 
Kremlin Meeting With the President Yesterday"] 
  [Text] Boris Yeltsin's meeting with representatives of 
"state, public, and business communities of Russia" (a quotation 
from the statement that the participants in the meeting approved 
in general) was somewhat strange, at least because people not 
only from the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], but 
also the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] and "Yabloko" 
did not attend it. Sergey Stankevich told your NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA correspondent that PRES leader Sergey Shakhray did 
receive an invitation, but he was on a business trip, and other 
representatives of the party were not welcome at the meeting. 
Mr. Stankevich said that in principle the meeting was organized 
for the purpose of reconciling the extreme ends of the political 
spectrum, although it is hard to agree that the communists, 
agrarians, and sectoral trade unions on one hand, and "Russia's 
Choice" and the independent trade unions on the other, may be 
considered as such. One may surmise, however, that someone 
substituting for Mr. Shakhray as party leader was not needed 
because the prime minister took part in the meeting. 
  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy was also passed over for an invitation, 
maybe because he does not represent any of the extreme forces. 
Mr. Yavlinskiy himself was calm, saying only that it seems 
somewhat strange that people should be convened to reach an 
accord precisely on the next day after a meeting with a former 
U.S. President was canceled because the latter dared meet 
opposition leaders. 
  The participants in the meeting adopted a statement agreeing 
to the idea of drawing up and signing an agreement on civil 
peace in Russia so as to create conditions for the Russian 
economy to overcome the crisis and to stage a recovery in the 
near future, to make policies more predictable and 
understandable, and so forth. The statement, the authorship of 
which is attributed to Georgiy Satarov, also has lots of other 
grand, albeit somewhat sloppily constructed phrases. 
  Yesterday, State Duma factions considered its candidates for 
the would-be working group to draw up the text of the civil 
peace agreement. It has transpired that to all appearances, 
none of those amnestied or their proxies will be part of the 
group.

President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree "On Accountability for 
Violation of the Working Rights of Citizens," which said that 
the procuracy of the Russian Federation should increase control 
over the observation of Russian legislation on work, collective 
treaties and agreements by enterprises, institutions and 
organizations, irrespective of forms of property and 
departmental subordination. The procuracy should take special 
measures to avoid delays in payment of salaries. 
  It has been recommended that courts should pay special 
attention to the necessity of taking measures directed at 
revelation and elimination of reasons and conditions that cause 
these violations when they investigate cases on violations of 
Russian legislation on work, collective treaties, and agreements.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin is likely to pass a 
decree putting off elections to the local self-government bodies 
until autumn, Chief of the President's Staff Sergey Filatov 
announced during an intercom conference between the Central 
Electoral Commission and the chairmen of the local electoral 
commissions. He noted, however, that in the regions where 
elections had been properly prepared, they would be held 
according to schedule. 
  Filatov believes that elections to the local governments 
should be suspended because it is still unclear what authority 
they would carry. The population must decide what their 
government should be like, he said. In each region the 
government should have its specific features, he added. 
  He expressed concern about the violations in the election 
campaigns revealed in individual regions. Some electoral 
districts are formed up on the basis of the national principle, 
he said, and the electors' proportions are violated, too. 
Filatov stated that if these violations were politically 
tinged, a new wave of confrontation might rise and the process 
of national reconciliation might be slowed down.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 10 TASS -- Preparations for the 
upcoming elections to bodies of local government in Russia's 
constituent republics and regions are just "a matter of 
coordination between bodies of power and the population," 
according to Chief of the Russian president's staff Sergey 
Filatov. He participated on Thursday in a hotline telephone 
conference with regional leaders and heads of constituency 
electoral commissions. The conference was held by the Central 
Electoral Commission together with the presidential staff with 
an aim to check whether subjects of the Federation were ready 
for the forthcoming elections. 
  Theoretically, all issues pertaining to the polls have been 
settled. But there are some facts provoking concern of federal 
authorities, filatov noted. First of all, these are certain 
breaches of citizens' voting rights, which have been already 
mentioned in a resolution by the State Duma. Thus, many experts 
point to improper "slicing" of constituencies. "There is some 
doubting that in certain cases the apportionment was politically 
motivated", the presidential staff's chief suggested. 
Sometimes, segmentation into constituencies "was carried out 
along ethnic lines, with distorted proportions in the number of 
constituents and a shift towards rural areas," he noted. 
  Filatov urged regional leaders not to abuse their powers, 
since at the moment they are "the only authorities in localities 
and should always remember that executive and elected bodies of 
power should be kept in balance." One must not "erect barricades 
from the very outset of the election campaign," Filatov 
stressed. If we build up confrontation between different 
branches of government, reconciliation in the society will be 
never achieved, he firmly believes. 
  Dwelling upon elections to bodies of local government, the 
presidential aide noted that some regions did not understand 
well enough what local government should look like. In this 
connection, Filatov referred to the Constitution which 
stipulates that local self-government is separated from bodies 
of federal power. It is up to local residents to decide what 
government they need. Local bodies of power should not be 
unified. Regional specifics and traditions should be taken into 
consideration. 
  Filatov stressed the need for a law to give a clear 
definition for bodies of local government. He encouraged 
participants in the telephone conference to come up with their 
proposals on this issue, so that a draft law on local government 
could be submitted to the State Duma. Some officials believe 
that elections to bodies of local government should be postponed 
until after an appropriate law is passed. Filatov said the 
president was likely to issue a decree postponing the polls 
until this autumn, as the public chamber proposed. As for the 
regions which have settled all the problems in this field, 
elections will be held at the discretion of local authorities 
and residents. 
  Filatov also expressed concern over the population's 
inertness in the election campaign. He called upon regional 
leaders to "work for the highest possible turnout in the 
upcoming elections".

  [Text] Nizhnyy Novgorod March 10 TASS -- Despite the deep 
economic crisis and stagnation in the scientific and 
technological complex, many of Russia's high technologies 
maintain leading positions in the world. This conclusion was 
made by the Russian governmental delegation led by Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin after a visit to the Nizhnyy 
Novgorod region, particularly the local TV-set factory which 
demonstrated the newest and most advance radar capable of 
detecting the most sophisticated "Stealth planes" at a range of 
up to 1,200 kilometers. 
  Chernomyrdin also met with the directors of Nizhnyy 
Novgorod's defence plants and heads of local administrations to 
discuss conversion. The premier urged them to exert maximum 
effort in order to preserve the defence, scientific and 
technological potential of the country. 
  The draft budget for 1994 slightly cuts military 
expenditures. This may lead to the "immediate demobilisation of 
400,000 servicemen and termination of arms purchases," according 
to First Defence Minister Andrey Kokoshin. 
  Chernomyrdin was in the Nizhnyy Novgorod region to take part 
in an agricultural conference, "Land Reform: the Nizhnyy 
Novgorod Model," which was attended by the leaders of more than 
40 Russian regions. The region has been carrying out a 
comprehensive programme of land privatisation and reorganisation 
of state and collective farms since the autumn of 1993. Two 
farms have already held auctions to sell plots of land and 
property. 
  Chernomyrdin called for radical changes in the system of 
state financing of agriculture and said that "the state has 
always supported and will support agriculture because Russia 
cannot survive without it." 
  "We will lend money against guaranteed results and only on 
the basis of such results. We must know how much food and of 
what quality people of Russia will receive on the allocated 
budget means," the premier said. He said that the draft budget 
for 1994 envisages allocating 11 billion roubles to agriculture 
this year. 
  The main task of the government is to "breed" an effective, 
independent and sovereign owner in the agrarian sector, the 
premier said. He praised the experience of land auctions 
organised in the region, one of which he attended today. The 
aim of such auctions is to encourage the owners of plots of land 
and other property to play a more active part in agriculture. 
  The development of the system of land and property auctions 
marks considerable progress on the way towards building a 
civilised market. The existing land law has so far failed to 
create conditions for the transfer of land to those who would 
use it more effectively. There is no mechanism regulating the 
purchasing, selling and leasing of land in Russia, chernomyrdin 
said. He considers land auctions as the real beginning of the 
process to establish a land market in Russia. The premier 
believes that the experience of land auctions in Nizhnyy 
Novgorod should be used across the entire Russia. 
  The conference was also attended by First-Vice Prime 
Ministers Aleksandr Zaveryukha and Anatoliy Chubays. 
Chernomyrdin is expected to return to Moscow today.

  [Text] The Russian Liberal Democratic Party [LDPR] 
parliamentary faction has once again drawn attention to itself. 
Judging from what is going on, a scandal is brewing. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] It seems that Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy has not been able to prevent a split in his party. 
Today Viktor Kobelev, the chief of staff of the LDPR's Central 
Committee, in an interview to our program, announced his 
definitive break with the head of the party. We remind you that 
almost a month ago, Viktor Kobelev tried to leave the faction 
but the LDPR leader persuaded him not to do it, while telling 
the press that the party's second man's attempt to leave was a 
planned action necessary to expose special service agents in the 
ranks of the party. 
  According to Kobelev, this claim is absolutely groundless. 
Moreover, as became clear today, the chief of staff, together 
with his deputy, Aleksandr Pronin, left the faction at their 
first attempt, having concluded a certain truce with 
Zhirinovskiy, which the latter has recently violated by 
insisting on an amendment to the law on the status of deputies. 
This amendment would allow Duma leaders to recall deputies who 
are members of their factions at their own volition. Kobelev is 
now in a determined and definite frame of mind. 
  [Begin Kobelev recording] I chose my credo very clearly -- I 
am outside the faction while Zhirinovskiy is the leader of the 
faction. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] According to the chief of staff, after he, 
Pronin, and Anatoliy Kashpirovskiy leave, the majority of 
Liberal Democrats are ready to leave the faction, but at the 
moment are frightened that Zhirinivoskiy might be able to 
influence their deputy places. Incidentally, the position of 
the head of the LDPR himself in the Duma is a bit shaky today, 
since the Shchelkov Rayon court deemed his deputy mandate 
invalid. Viktor Kobelev is ready to take the vacant place of 
the faction leader, that is, if that is the decision of the 
party. But even if this does not happen, the former chief of 
staff, who knows all the secrets of the party's money, is the 
most dangerous figure today for the LDPR head; he is capable of 
heading a powerful internal party opposition. 
  [Begin Kobelev recording] I will save -- I am not afraid of 
that word -- or at least I will try to save Russia from 
unpredictable politicians. [end recording]

  [Text] The Union of Soviet Stalinists and the Bolshevik 
Platform in the CPSU accused Gennadiy Zyuganov, the leader of 
the Communist Party of the Russian Federation of pursuing an 
opportunistic "neo-Gorbachev" line. They made a statement to 
this effect after Zyuganov's meeting with Richard Nixon, former 
U.S. president. 
  "We do not know what Messrs. Nixon and Zyuganov talked 
about, 
but judging by the fact that Mr. Nixon was pleased with the 
meeting, Mr. Zyuganov misrepresented the outlook for revival of 
communism in the USSR. There is, however, a Bolshevik, 
Leninite-Stalinite wing as well as Zyuganov's opportunistic 
neo-Gorbachev wing in today's Soviet communist movement. The 
former is discriminated against by opportunists of the 
Zyuganov's and Shenin's kind from inside the communist camp more 
than by the authorities," said the statement made public 
Wednesday. 
  The authors of the statement believed that today a true 
communist was a Stalinite and revival of the Stalin-founded 
economic system was the only way to extract the country from the 
plight into which the anti-Stalinists dragged it during the 40 
years since Stalin's death.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Shakhray, minister for nationalities </F>
affairs and regional policy, by Vasiliy Ustyuzhanin in Moscow; 
date not given: "Amnesty Has Saved Chernomyrdin. Memorandum of 
Accord Has Avoided Acute Political Crisis" -- first two 
paragraphs are introduction] 
  [Text] Sergey Shakhray has unexpectedly become a key 
figure in the disposition of political forces this spring. His 
parliamentary speech in support of the amnesty has muddled up 
quite a few people's cards. 
  Our talk took place in the new office of the minister for 
nationalities affairs and regional policy on Krasnopresnenskaya 
Embankment. Five months ago a hail of bullets flew through 
these windows on the third story of the White House. Now they 
look onto a peaceful view of the Moscow River. 
  [Ustyuzhanin] Sergey Mikhaylovich, a number of your former 
kindred spirits have now turned on you with accusations of a 
shameless act of betrayal. 
  [Shakhray] It is the same old story. The moral aspect was 
left out of the debate about the amnesty altogether. It was 
obvious to all that both sides were to blame for the events of 
3-4 October last year, albeit to differing degrees. These 
events were preceded by a creeping usurpation of power without 
any formal violation of the Constitution by the Supreme Soviet. 
The president cut this Gordian knot by formally violating the 
Constitution. The result was the assault on City Hall and 
"Ostankino" and the shoot-out at the White House. It was an 
episode of civil war. The logic of civilian clashes does not 
know of any precedents for identical punishment. First of all 
the victors put the vanquished on trial, later the tables are 
turned, and so on ad infinitum. And at every stage of this 
process innocent people become casualties. There is only one 
effective way to get out of strong-arm confrontation, and that 
is through an act of reconciliation. And we have now proposed 
one. 
  [Ustyuzhanin] Are you not oversimplifying things? 
  [Shakhray] To many people it is was clear that 1994 could 
have become a year of civil war. The charge of confrontation 
that had accumulated over recent years had become too powerful. 
For a time we lifted this threat. But the amnesty act 
relegated the "Russia's Choice" bloc to the political 
wilderness. Hence the sharp reaction to the other parties' 
peacemaking initiative. 
  [Ustyuzhanin] What in your view are the principal political 
gains of the amnesty? 
  [Shakhray] The whole of society has won. I know the 
reaction from the regions -- it is a sigh of relief. The heads 
of administrations with whom I spoke recently are requesting 
that we take further steps in this direction. The president, 
government, parliament, and those who benefited by the amnesty 
are all winners by this. The president and the Duma will 
cooperate closely (surprisingly, this is happening at the 
moment), passions will finally die down, and "Democratic 
Russia's" censure will abate. It will become apparent that the 
interests of the Duma and the president coincide, at least 
tactically and temporarily. Some of the Duma deputies, who came 
to the Duma with the aim of freeing the Lefortovo inmates, have 
kept their promise and a potential hotbed of conflict has thus 
been extinguished. Although their interests and those of the 
released Lefortovo prisoners will probably diverge in the future. 
  [Ustyuzhanin] What makes you say this? 
  [Shakhray] New leaders have appeared within the Duma itself, 
they do not want confrontation, it is important to them to 
retain the image of initiators of civil reconciliation and to 
accumulate political capital. The fact that Rutskoy and 
Khasbulatov are free is also advantageous for the president. 
The juridical and political bases of their bid for power have 
now entirely vanished. Anyone may return to power, but only 
through elections. Which is great! This in itself is a step 
toward reconciliation. The main point is that the Memorandum of 
Accord has become the valve which has let off steam from the 
acute political crisis expected in April or May. 
  [Ustyuzhanin] Why in April or May, and what crisis are you 
talking about? 
  [Shakhray] In society today we are currently witnessing a 
struggle between three elites -- the Moscow elite, the regional 
elite, and the sector elite. Moreover, the latter two elites 
have begun to move closer together. For its part, the Moscow 
elite has concentrated over 70 percent of the entire country's 
banking capital in the capital's banks, and it has powerful 
levers of influence on the authorities. All of these forces are 
seeking a leader and middlemen to help the competing sides avoid 
clashes. One way of letting off steam might have been a demand 
for the president to "surrender" his premier and his cabinet. 
The amnesty, however, has disrupted the already established 
"combat alliances" and thrown their plans into disarray. The 
amnesty has basically saved Chernomyrdin's skin. 
  [Ustyuzhanin] Sergey Mikhaylovich, judging by your analysis, 
this summer we will witness universal brotherhood.... 
  [Shakhray] There is still a long way to go before we reach 
that stage. The country has gained a temporary breathing space, 
a pause. This is the one thing we can thank the amnesty for. 
But it is only a breathing space. Unless we exploit it, we 
could see a repetition of the events of October. And then a new 
figure would appear at the forefront of the political stage -- 
the man in shoulder boards. The establishment of order in the 
country would then cost far more lives. We must do much more to 
achieve brotherhood. 
  [Ustyuzhanin] What exactly? 
  [Shakhray] Right now orthodox Christians, Muslims, and all 
other Russian faiths should hold funeral services for the dead. 
We all need to beg forgiveness of the families of the killed 
and wounded, to acknowledge that it is impossible to define who 
is right and who is guilty by juridical methods. Our leaders 
need to repent most of all. The package of documents adopted by 
the Duma offers this opportunity for repentance and civil 
reconciliation. 
  Right now it is important to give the new parliament the 
chance to work at full throttle. The economy will suffocate 
without laws. After all, there is virtually no time left for 
the Duma to finish its work -- 22 months. It would be offensive 
and shameful to waste these months on new political clashes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yegor Gaydar, leader of "Russia's Choice," </F>
by Nikolay Kishkin and Olga Solomonova; place and date not 
given: "Yegor Gaydar: `There Are No Free Lunches' -- Leader of 
the `Russia's Choice' Parliamentary Faction and Former First 
Vice Premier of the Russian Government Announces the Formation 
of a New Party"] 
  [Text] [TRUD] As we know, following your departure from 
the government, criticism of the "Gaydar" course of reforms 
intensified. TRUD has frequently given your opponents the 
chance to have their say. Today the floor is yours. Why are 
you setting up your own party, Yegor Timurovich? Do you intend 
to use it to become president or to take charge of the Cabinet 
of Ministers in two years' time, or are your plans more modest? 
  [Gaydar] Our goals are highly serious, but they are not 
linked with who specifically tries to become president or 
premier. 
  The essence of the political choice and the cataclysms of 
1994, defining it as simply as possible, is that, in my opinion, 
the present government is unable to make a firm decision about 
what it wants to do in the economy. Decisiveness presupposes a 
firm choice between one of two consistent and intelligible 
strategies. 
  The first possible strategy is as follows. The government, 
faced with the present difficulties and unable to make up its 
mind to go forward, firmly pursues the course of establishing a 
directive-based, command economy with its plans, funds, quotas, 
distribution shortfalls, suppressed inflation, "backdoor 
dealings," speculation, unconvertible currency, guaranteed 
employment, and so forth. And then everything is understood -- 
what to do today, tomorrow, and the day after that, what 
problems to resolve, what threats arise, and whom to fight. 
  Then there is the second strategy. The government 
understands that it is possible to get out of the current 
intermediate position by another route. It decides quickly and 
consistently to form market mechanisms, remove excessive state 
pressure on the economy, reform the legal system, guarantee the 
right to property, stabilize the national currency, gradually 
reduce taxes, and create incentives for private savings and 
investments. And to carry out reforms on this basis. Then it 
is also clear what to do in the first, second, and third stage. 
  But the most difficult problem arises when neither the first 
nor the second decision is made. Then hesitations inevitably 
begin. We saw this policy in 1989-1991, when the Union 
leadership could not make up its mind. 
  Now we are again in a similar intermediate position, from 
which there are the two possible escape routes of which I have 
already spoken. Moreover, the first of them is backed by fairly 
clear forces, and, against the background of the inevitable 
strains posed by the intermediate position, the possibility 
exists that they will manage to convince people that this 
solution is the simplest, the most tried and tested, and the 
most reliable. Despite the complete futility of this solution, 
the danger of its being chosen is real. A highly structured 
organization with a long tradition is working toward this end -- 
the Communist Party. 
  Before 1992, when the wind seemed to be filling the sails of 
democratic transformations, the democrats could afford not to 
counterpose to the first alternative a highly structured 
organization in the form of a party. "Democratic Russia" was 
not a powerful organization either in 1989 or in 1990. It went 
from victory to victory on the wave of disillusion with the old 
system, the old ideology, and the old bosses. That wave has now 
subsided. In order to uphold the second alternative, which, in 
my view, is the absolutely essential condition and prerequisite 
for the creation of a civilized society in our country, serious 
systematic efforts are necessary. 
  The formation of our party is just such an effort to form a 
force which will champion the second, democratic, civilized 
alternative in Russia. So that the small shoots of our civil 
society which have managed to grow within this period are not 
once again flattened by an armor-plated roller. So that they 
are not destroyed. 
  [TRUD] But you, Yegor Timurovich -- indeed, "Choice" as well 
-- have the reputation in the eyes of a significant section of 
society of being "reformist wreckers." How do you intend to 
change this opinion? 
  [Gaydar] We will direct our main efforts at explaining the 
simple truth. It is our duty to explain who, in point of fact, 
wrecked the economy, who robbed our gold and currency reserves, 
what really could be done, what we did, and, of course, what 
needs to be done today to extricate the country from its 
difficult position. 
  It should be borne in mind that we were really forced to 
assume the huge burden of responsibility for the reforms. 
Ruslan Imranovich [Khasbulatov] artlessly believed that 10 days 
after the beginning of the reforms it was already time to 
dismiss the government which had done the donkeywork. He simply 
underestimated the fact that this donkeywork would take more 
than one month. We understood perfectly well how difficult and 
thankless this work was, and how easy it was for our opponents 
to explain how wonderfully they would have done everything if 
evil forces in the shape of Gaydar and "Russia's Choice" had not 
interfered. 
  The benefits which the reforms brought people, despite their 
huge costs, were until now almost taken for granted: both the 
market, which is more or less stable, and the ruble -- though 
people grumble about it, it is on the whole convertible, and you 
no longer have to go from Tula to Moscow for sausage meat, or 
wait in line.... What was simply impossible to imagine two 
years ago had become almost customary. All this, it seemed, was 
guaranteed. But now people are beginning to understand that it 
is not all completely guaranteed. 
  Today the question is not whether this could have been done 
more easily or more mildly than it was done by Gaydar, but 
whether or not it will endure. Or will everything be taken away 
again? Of course, it can be taken away. In 1925, as a result 
of the New Economic Policy, there was a fully developed market 
in Russia, but in 1928 they again introduced ration cards, and 
there came a famine and other choice delights. Will this be 
repeated? 
  What we have on our side is clarity. Perhaps not very 
pleasant, but clarity all the same. It is absolutely clear what 
we stand for and what we will not allow while we are alive and 
able to do something. So much for our reputation. 
  [TRUD] Right now many parties of every kind are being set 
up. Not one of them has yet done anything, hence they have 
nothing to answer for. But you already have the burden of 
responsibility for the past hanging round your neck.... 
  [Gaydar] Thank God, we now have more opportunity to talk 
frankly than before. After all, it becomes both funny and sad 
when it suddenly turns out that, for everything that the 
government did without me in the spring of 1993 -- they kept the 
crazy state order for agricultural production, they kept 
preferential credits, they fixed crazy prices, they adopted a 
whole range of federal programs that were wholly unsupported, 
they introduced state subsidies for mixed feed and increased 
other subsidies -- for all this, it turns out, Gaydar is now to 
blame. Just as I am to blame for the fact that, when I came in, 
I started to abolish preferential credits and subsidies.... I 
am also blamed for the fact that Chernomyrdin cannot fulfill the 
promises he dished out in the spring. 
  We all understand this. But before, shackled by government 
solidarity, we could not say so plainly, because quarrels of 
this kind are, in my view, appropriate either in cabinet 
sessions, or if you are no longer working in the government. 
But now I can talk frankly about it all. 
  [TRUD] Your opponents say roughly the following: Gaydar 
delayed the payment of wages, so inflation was reduced, but now 
Chernomyrdin has paid the accumulated debts, and inflation has 
shot up. 
  [Gaydar] What is the crux of this problem? Since last 
spring, from the time that the government issued a colossal 
number of impracticable promises, events have been operating, as 
it were, according to two sets of logic. One is the logic of 
current funding: Money, generally speaking, can be counted; 
some is given out, some is not. But another logic began to 
develop -- the economy of promises, which is always mixed with 
untruths. Because it is simply impossible to deliver such 
promises afterward. 
  When we came into the government last fall, the essence of 
our actions was not delaying the payment of wages -- that was 
done before we came, in May, June, July, and August -- but 
trying to quickly reduce the volume of impracticable promises. 
To stop lying, to put it simply. And we at once launched an 
assault on the most expensive impracticable promises -- 
preferential credits. 
  [TRUD] You supported the liberalization of bread prices and 
at the same time planned to win the elections? 
  [Gaydar] Yes, I knew that that was politically 
disadvantageous, but it was honest. I was actually in favor of 
saying bluntly that we could not pay subsidies on mixed feed, 
and I revoked them. But the subsidies were restored the next 
day. That was last October. But after all, they are not being 
paid today. There is no money to do so. They represent a 
fantastic expense! You could stop funding higher and secondary 
education and science altogether -- you still would not be able 
to afford these subsidies. But instead of honestly saying to 
agricultural workers: You will not get this money, do not 
expect it -- they continue to promise it. 
  I believe that the most terrible vice of the policy pursued 
in 1993 was that it was a policy of budget payment defaults, a 
policy of unaffordable promises. After all, if you really want 
the fascists to come to power in the elections, employ the 
simplest policy -- first promise, and then fail to deliver. 
Nothing could be simpler! 
  [TRUD] To what extent, in your opinion, did the flaws and 
failures of the reformist course and the shock therapy help 
strengthen national radicalism? 
  [Gaydar] All radical social transformations are a difficult 
and painful affair. Some people adapt very well, others with 
difficulty and badly. And society always reacts to this pain 
with an upsurge of aggression, an attempt to find someone to 
blame, to find simple explanations. 
  It is this that lies at the heart of our desire to bring the 
time frames of economic and social transformations in Russia as 
close together as possible. And the fact that we did not manage 
to do this fully -- that the reforms began to skid -- in my view 
substantially increased the risk of the advent of radical 
national socialism. 
  [TRUD] Our multiparty system has expressed itself in the 
form of an unthinkable number of lilliputian parties. What are 
you doing to ensure that your party is not the same sort of 
closet-cum-club organization? Do you have support in the 
regions? 
  [Gaydar] We do indeed have very few real parties, and of 
them the most powerful and viable is the Communist Party. The 
democrats also have their own organizations, but they are very 
badly structured, without clear discipline or fixed membership. 
Our main task today is to create a sufficiently broad 
organization, taking whatever lies in the potential of 
democratic structures and is at the same time clear and 
definite. Anyway, it was the largest faction in the Duma, 
backed by dozens of deputies representing the democratic forces 
in the most diverse regions of Russia, which took the initiative 
to organize the party. A faction for which millions of Russians 
voted. Of course a party will be viable if it has support in 
the regions. We have such support, I believe. 
  [TRUD] Do you not think that "Democratic Russia's" recent 
decision, in which it was mildly intimated that you cannot rely 
on "Democratic Russia's" support, will affect the formation of 
your party? 
  [Gaydar] "Democratic Russia" is, of course, a large 
organization, in which there are many people with different 
viewpoints. I believe that we have a reasonable dialogue with 
them, and we by no means want to cram all "Democratic Russia's" 
activists into the new party. I consider their council's 
resolution that "`Democratic Russia's' regional organizations 
will determine independently the degree of their practical 
participation" in the formation of our party as a mild form of 
support. We hope to hold our constituent congress in late May. 
  [TRUD] You will recall that when the formation of the 
"Russia's Choice" movement was just beginning, the first to 
propose setting up a party on the basis of the movement was 
Gennadiy Burbulis. Has he lost the initiative today, or have 
you seized it? 
  [Gaydar] Gennadiy Eduardovich did indeed more than once 
express the idea of creating such a democratic party -- in 1992 
and in early 1993. But the problems which then stood in the way 
could not be overcome. Today this is a decision of the faction 
to which he also belongs. I know that Burbulis has his own 
special approaches to the problems of party organization and the 
development of a party-based movement. I think that we should 
give him the chance to spell out his position. 
  [TRUD] The name of your party is the "Liberal Conservative 
Party." However, "Russia's Choice" is known as more of a 
radical democratic movement. Does not the one exclude the other? 
  [Gaydar] Indeed, today we are perhaps the biggest 
conservatives in Russia. Because if we have managed to grow 
something, however small, in the past two years, to get nearer 
to an open society, to the market, to freedom of speech, and to 
private ownership, our main task is to conserve that. In 
addition, we also support traditional conservative values -- 
stable legislation, support for order, and the fight against 
crime... 
  [TRUD] Imagining a social cross-section of society, at what 
levels do you see the potential members of your party? 
  [Gaydar] There are statistics about who voted for "Russia's 
Choice." They are people with above-average education and 
above-average qualifications, on average or slightly 
above-average incomes. That is to say a stratum which in 
civilized, developed market economies is called the middle class. 
  In Russia this middle class consists of skilled workers of 
the free professions and small-time property owners. Only this 
class, I am profoundly convinced, can become the staunch 
mainstay of a stable society, of democracy and the market. 
  [TRUD] It is also, of course, the most creatively active 
stratum of society. But it is not strong enough, it is not very 
united, and it is eclipsed by lumpenized but well-organized 
groups... 
  [Gaydar] You are absolutely right. That is indeed the 
essence of the social, economic, and politic alternative with 
which we are faced today. It is the choice between the lumpen 
who has been told that the foreigner is his enemy and that if he 
crushes that enemy and breaks through to the Indian Ocean, he 
can have a pineapple in one hand and a banana in the other, and 
the rational section of society which understands that there are 
no free lunches.

  [Text] Moscow March 10 TASS -- There have been no attempts 
by top officials to put pressure on the court during the 
hearings of the case involving the leaders of the 1991 August 
failed coup, Anatoliy Ukolov, chief judge in the trial, said. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Thursday, Ukolov 
said that the court, as a body which applies the law, could not 
disobey the decision of the Russian Parliament on amnesty. 
  Asked about how the decision on amnesty was applied to 
former 
Soviet Vice-President Gennadiy Yanayev whose case was considered 
separately and Aleksandr Tizyakov, a large industrialist, whose 
case was suspended, Ukolov said that the military board of the 
Russian Supreme Court adopted a decision to amnesty them on 
March 2, the next day after the original decision on amnesty was 
passed.

case of organisers of the 1991 Soviet coup has resumed after the 
Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation 
considered and satisfied the appeal of the prosecution on 
Friday, TASS learned from the secretariat of the Presidium. 
  The trial of the 1991 coup organisers was declared over 
after 
the Russian State Duma proclaimed an amnesty to the plotters. 
However, the prosecution appealed against the decision saying 
that any trial which is already under way is to be completed by 
passing a guilty or non-guilty verdict. If the verdict is 
guilty, the accused will then be amnestied.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Liliya Kuznetsova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 10 TASS -- The flood of immigrants from 
third-world countries is growing like a snowball. Their number 
increases by something like one hundred people a day, announced 
on Thursday an official in the Russian Federal Migration Service. 
  "Russia will accept only those who qualify as refugees", 
Yuriy Arkhipov, the head of the department on external 
migration, declared in an article with ITAR-TASS. "No one will 
be able to get that status automatically". 
  Arkhipov holds the opinion that Russia has ended up with a 
crisis situation in the immigrant sphere because the law adopted 
on refugees and the act on Russia's accession to the United 
Nations 1951 convention "on the status of refugees" were not 
very well thought out. At the same time, he noted, "the Western 
countries quickly evaluated the situation and, as soon as Russia 
signed the convention, made their entry laws much stricter". 
  At that time, a regional office representing the Department 
of the UN High Commissioner for Refugee Affairs was formed in 
Russia, with the goal of solving the problems of immigrants who 
were already in the Russian Federation. Therefore, Arkhipov 
said, "Russia, without being aware of it, became the country 
which received the whole flood of migrants from the countries of 
Asia, Africa, and the Middle East". 
  In order to solve the problems created by immigrants from 
developing countries, it is necessary to, first of all, 
"regulate the situation on the border through legislation and 
international agreements", said the migration official. That 
does not mean, he cautioned, that we "should erect an iron 
curtain, but we cannot put up with the transparency of the 
Russian borders any longer". 
  Arkhipov expressed his opinion that every country in the 
Commonwealth of Independent States should take the 
responsibility for the security of its borders upon itself. 
Otherwise, "trying to limit the flow of immigrants is like 
bailing water with a sieve". 
  Besides, Arkhipov said, Russia should let the world 
community 
know through the mass media that it "is not considering 
establishing any aid programmes for massive waves of immigrants 
from third-world countries". 
  Explaining the way the immigrants operate, the official said 
the majority of them do not immediately apply for refugee status 
as soon as they cross the border, as they should under the law, 
but try to get to Moscow. "The country's capital is not a 
reception point". The migration services, even after they grant 
refugee status to somebody, "do not then settle the immigrant in 
the Moscow region". Moscow already holds about 180 thousand 
immigrants, who have created a whole mass of problems. "They do 
not respect Russian citizens, ignore the laws of the country 
sheltering them, and do not obey law enforcement 
representatives", he claimed. 
  Arkhipov said the situation can be changed only by "the 
creation of a clear mechanism for determining the legal status 
of foreign citizens on Russian territory as a basis for adopting 
the following appropriate decisions".

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin today signed a 
decree on holding an experiment in Tula Oblast to create 
organizational, legal, and economic conditions for the 
development of a regional agro-industrial complex, the 
presidential press service has reported. It is believed that 
the experiment will span the period between 1994 and 1998. It 
will be underpinned by economic self-management, expanded rights 
of the oblast authorities in implementing budgetary, investment, 
and credits policies, and also by improved internal production 
and economic relations.

<F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Chubays: "Check Privatization Will End </F>
30 June Regardless of Who Puts a Spanner in the Works"] 
  [Text] Regardless of any changes in the situation or any 
attempts to change the course of privatization, despite attempts 
to renounce the check privatization, I am prepared to say 
absolutely unequivocally: The program will be implemented 
fully, down to the last privatization check, by the set deadline 
of 30 June 1994. 
  The program is continuing to develop. Unique packages of 
shares of major enterprises, of interest to shareholders, will 
be issued at check auctions in the near future. Check auctions 
in the power and oil industries are now being developed. Shares 
from the Ulyanovsk Automobile Plant, the "Optoyuviler" 
Joint-Stock Company, the Novorossiysk Shipping Company, and 
dozens of other efficient enterprises will be issued at check 
auctions in the near future. That, strictly speaking, was how 
our program was structured. 
  Today the key issue for us is the question of the 
postprivatization functioning of the enterprises. Therefore, to 
a great extent, all of us are switching our activity and our 
influence to everything that is connected with the creation of 
sources of investment for the privatized enterprises. My 
colleagues and I have recently been putting forward various 
initiatives concerning the search for new sources of 
investments. We are also actively supporting Western initiatives 
in this sphere. A Russian-U.S. enterprise fund is now being 
created in Russia, which will only be involved in investments in 
privatized enterprises, and this means no less than $300 
million. Dozens of funds like this will come into being in the 
near future, and we are trying to help them as much as possible 
in their practicable work.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Yermolin: "Will They Curb Inflation? </F>
Russian Federation President's Expert on Economic Reform 
Prospects"] 
  [Text] The ordinary person in the street did not need 
experts to tell him that Russia is more intent on spending on 
itself at the moment than on investing. But when Aleksandr 
Lifshits, head of the Russian Federation president's group of 
experts, says that he fears to look into a future where the 
actual use of depreciation deductions, which are essential to 
compensate for wear and tear, will be 10 percent as against 90 
percent for consumption, you begin to look at the situation in a 
rather different way. 
  In simple terms, what we are saying is that we can say 
goodbye to industrial development, to high-technology 
production, and to reproduction in general unless, in the very 
near future (according to Lifshits), the government proposes 
measures to beat the crisis. The Russian Federation president's 
expert believes that one effective method in this case might be 
a slight relaxation of the procedure of regulation on the part 
of the state. What he said was literally as follows: "We are 
exchanging the absence of money for the presence of economic 
freedom." That is, the enterprising must be given the 
opportunity to fight for their own survival to maximum effect. 
At least, we must not get in their way. 
  In the meantime, while producing little, we are wearing out 
clothes that we did not make, we are finishing off a machine 
tool pool that dates back to the five-year plans, and we are in 
no hurry to work for the future, concentrating, as we are, 
entirely on the present. Will we be able to curb the rate of 
price increases in these circumstances? Aleksandr Lifshits 
pointed out that the government's August program guidelines for 
the rate of price increases by December 1994 were set at 3-5. 
But, according to the expert's estimates, these indicators may 
leap to 10-12. As a result many of the processes that are 
destroying our economy would become simply irreversible. 
  According to Lifshits, unless the government goes for 
fundamental measures the State Duma is bound to decide to do so. 
He was not optimistic about the fate of the state budget -- the 
figures laid down in it may not hold out for more than three or 
four months. And then further adjustment will be needed.

<F P=106> [Article by State Duma Deputy (and former finance minister) </F>
Boris Fedorov: "The New Monetarists"] 
  [Text] For me the main enigma of the enlarged government 
session was the very tough and irritated message the premier 
addressed to certain mysterious, power-hungry heads of 
laboratories. On consulting the "Who's Who in Russia" I 
ascertained that Shakhray was the sole laboratory head among 
current and recent deputy chairmen. What is the significance of 
this? 
  To be serious, no other major revelations were made at the 
session. The president's guidelines were repeated in a pretty 
general and vague way. The differences in objectives regarding 
inflation were retained. As expected, it remained unclear how 
the government intends to carry out its plans. Three months 
have now passed since the elections, but no specific action has 
been seen to date. 
  I have just returned from abroad, where I met with foreign 
bankers, industrialists, and journalists. I was very curious to 
learn their reaction to the "new economic course" so solemnly 
discussed in Moscow. The fact is there was virtually no 
reaction. There was indifference and skepticism. Virtually no 
one pins great hopes on the "new course." 
  No matter how I tried to persuade potential investors that 
the snags and deviations of Russian reforms should not be feared 
-- that the general course, despite everything, remains correct 
-- edginess and suspicion prevailed. Their stance may be summed 
up as follows: You regularly dupe us with your reforms and 
financial stabilization but still ask us to make investments and 
grant credit and talk about writing off old debts.... 
  Unfortunately this is, from a certain standpoint, true. 
There are many people among our functionaries who want to go 
into reverse, to isolate us from the world community, to 
introduce censorship and other delights of the old system.... 
  However, on the other hand, life serves as a good school and 
personal responsibility as a whole university. It seems to me 
that the key figures in executive power are drawing correct 
conclusions. The last two months have shown that when it comes 
to specific actions and decisions the evaluation of the 
situation has substantially changed. 
  The premier and the Central Bank chairman are today behaving 
like the most consistent "monetarists" -- they promise a lot but 
they give no money. These actions, of course, have nothing to 
do with real monetarism, but they are very sensible in 
principle, as they counter the attempts to flood the country 
with worthless money. 
  In this regard you can only express your respect for the 
authorities: They are withstanding monstrous pressure, they are 
considered by "their own people" to be the most arrant 
conservatives, Skokov asks them to acknowledge honestly that the 
causes of inflation lie in production and sign an agreement with 
his Union of Manufacturers, yet they hold out and give no one 
any money, and they have forgotten about "nonmonetary methods" 
of fighting inflation and its "inertial-oscillatory" character. 
  The sole problem is the lack of specific reform measures. In 
1993 several dozen such were implemented. In the current year, 
not a single one. On the contrary, there are signs of the 
reverse. Take, for example, such a masterpiece as the 23 
February decree on the agrarian complex. Apart from its 
patently crude nature -- it clearly cannot be carried out -- it 
contains many features agreeable to the ear of lobbyists -- 
subsidies, grants, credits.... 
  It is essential to move from simple "withholding" of money 
and talk of bankruptcies to decisive action; it is essential 
above all to establish basic order in finances and the state 
apparatus and to adopt a real budget. In two to three weeks 
from now, we will start analyzing the first quarter's results 
and will have to face up to the facts. 
  The main conclusion I have drawn from the past week is that 
there has been no "new" course. The government basically 
remains committed, albeit not consistently, to the old course. 
It is unclear why it was necessary to waste several months, 
undermine the exchange rate of the ruble, and make bombastic 
statements just for this. 
  However, the political situation is such that the government 
has no political base. It is under attack from left and right. 
Zyuganov demands that Chubays and Kozyrev be driven out of the 
government, others demand the government's resignation and early 
presidential elections, yet others demand a coalition 
government, even though the coalition we have today is more than 
sufficient. According to the "Itogi" TV program, only 5 percent 
of Russians think that the government has real power. 
  I think that until the government really changes its course, 
the democratic forces in the Duma should support it, since it 
could be replaced by an even less experienced government with an 
itch to test out experimentally their more than dubious ideas.

"Conversion of Central Bank of Russia Into Federal Reserve 
System Not Expected Yet"] 
  [Text] Irina Khakamada, leader of the "12 December" group, 
told your SEGODNYA correspondent yesterday that, in her view, 
the possible conversion of the Russian Federation Central Bank 
into a federal reserve system is, so far, in the stage of "ideas 
and wishes generated by the president's staff, and such an 
abrupt reconstruction of the financial system is not going to 
find support for the time being either in the government or in 
the Central Bank lobby." Irina Khakamada also thinks that the 
policy of the government and the Central Bank of Russia is 
primarily geared now at stabilizing today's financial structure, 
and then at increasing the state control and flexible 
maneuvering within the already set rules of the game. 
  An official statement about the possibility of restructuring 
the Central Bank of Russia into a federal reserve system came 
last week from Aleksandr Lifshits, head of a group of experts 
under the Russian Federation president. This is not a matter of 
xeroxing the U.S. Federal Reserve system, which makes it 
possible with the aid of a flexible adjustment of the discount 
rate and the supply of money in circulation to avoid abrupt 
inflationary changes in the economy. However, according to the 
economists and bankers behind presenting this idea to the top 
power echelons, a federal reserve system, if formed in Russia, 
would make it possible, on one hand, to end the Central Bank of 
Russia monopoly, and, on the other, to put in place civilized 
forms of internal hard currency settlements. 
  It is no surprise therefore that the given idea, which is so 
far just an idea, has provoked more than a burst of temper among 
Central Bank chiefs. (According to some information, Aleksandr 
Khandruyev, deputy chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, 
suggested to the unruly bankers, who had put forward this idea 
at a conference in the State Duma budget, taxes, and prices 
committee, that they "wash themselves in blood"). The prospect 
of weaker monopolist positions on the Russian financial market 
made Central Bank chiefs conduct a preemptive campaign to 
explain that the federal reserve system idea is corrupt and 
totally out of keeping with the specific Russian character. 
According to reports from informed sources, mutual 
understanding was reached.

  [Excerpts] The value of a deal between Aeroflot-Russian 
International Airlines and Boeing on leasing four Boeing 
767-300ER jumbo jets may be halved, while the term of lease may 
be cut by at least one year, the head of the company's 
international commercial department, Vladimir Tikhonov, told a 
conference of Aeroflot representatives abroad in Moscow 
Thursday. According to his calculations, the lease of four 
Boeing 767 airliners is "too costly" as the expenses may amount 
to $300 Mn. Tikhonov believes two jumbo jets will be quite 
enough, while the term of the lease may well be reduced to three 
to four instead of the proposed five years. 
  Tikhonov said he was sceptical about the experience of 
exploitation of five A310-300 in Russia. According to Airbus 
Industry which supplied the airliners in 1992, their leasing 
inflicted losses worth $15 Mn on Aeroflot in 1993 alone, while 
Aeroflot states the losses reached $22 Mn. [passage omitted] 
  Tikhonov said the high cost of the airbuses' use was caused 
by the exceptionally high amount of the lease ($46 Mn a year) 
which covers the entire profits from their exploitation. 
Commenting on the lease of foreign-made jets, Tikhonov said it 
was a "forced measure called to cover the deficit of modern 
long-range jets until new Russian airliners such as Il 96-300 
and Il 96M are supplied in sufficient quantities."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "1994 Grain Harvest Forecasts Are </F>
Unfavorable"] 
  [Text] Agriculture Ministry experts forecast a reduction in 
the gross grain harvest down to 89 million tonnes (against 99 
million tonnes in 1993 and 107 million tonnes in 1992), whereas 
the country's requirements are estimated at 114 million tonnes. 
According to the forecast of the Federal Hydrometeorology and 
Environmental Monitoring Service, around 13-16 percent of the 
entire sown area of winter crops will have to be resown in the 
spring. Given that the area of winter-sown crops, which account 
for one-third of the grain harvest, has been reduced, the scope 
of spring field work should be drastically increased. At the 
same time, only 75 percent of available tractors and 76 percent 
of plows (81 percent) were in working condition as of the 
beginning of March (against 80 and 81 percent respectively at 
the same time in 1993), while fuel and seed reserves were 
considerably smaller that usual. The availability of mineral 
fertilizers stands at 30 percent of the requisite level, and 
herbicides at slightly more than 50 percent.

  [Excerpt] Moscow, March 10 (AFP) -- The head of Russia's 
state nuclear consortium downplayed Thursday two leaks at a 
nuclear plant in northwestern Russia and said the west was 
overdramatizing such incidents in Russia's aging nuclear 
facilities. 
  Erik Pozhdishev, speaking during a conference on nuclear 
security here, said leaks of cooling liquid and vapour at the 
Kola nuclear plant in northwestern Russia in the past week were 
"not serious," and both were rated zero, or insignificant, on 
the international seven-point scale of nuclear incidents. His 
statement contradicted an earlier higher rating given to the 
first incident on March 3. He also denied that anything had 
happened Sunday, when Swedish experts said there had been a 
small incident at the Kola plant in northwestern Russia, which 
is close to the Swedish border. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Official data on chemical weapons in Russia is very 
conservative, thinks Aleksey Yablokov, chairman of the Russian 
Security Council's Interdepartental Commission for Ecological 
Safety. According to Interfax, he declared this at a news 
conference today. He said that in Russia there are not 40,000 
tonnes of toxic substances, as officially stated, but possibly a 
whole order of magnitude more. Apart from Aleksey Yablokov, the 
news conference was also attended by Lev Fedorov, a doctor of 
chemical sciences and co-author with the scientist Vil 
Mirzoyanov, who published the well-known article "Poisoned

  [Text] We've just received an urgent telegram in the 
office. The Russian Federation Procurator General's office has 
announced that on 11 March, acting Procurator General Ilyushenko 
dropped the criminal case against the chemist Vil Mirzoyanov, 
who was accused of divulging information that constituted a 
state secret, owing to the absence of any corpus delicti in his 
actions. 
  [Moscow INTERFAX in English at 2048 GMT on 10 March, in an 
earlier report, adds: "Russian scientist Vil Mirzayanov, charged 
with betraying a national secret, told Interfax on Thursday that 
he would continue his efforts to end the development of new 
chemical weapons in Russia." "Mirzayanov said Russia and other 
nations continued devising new toxic substances, for that did 
not contradict any international agreements. Thus, the Paris 
Convention on the destruction of chemical weapons does not 
mention new types of chemical arms, including binary weapons. 
`As long as work goes on on new kinds of toxic substances I 
will continue fighting whether I am arrested again or not," the 
scientist said.'"]

<F P=106> [Lev Aleynik report under the "Security" rubric: "Lev </F>
Fedorov Unsure Russia Produces No Chemical Weapons. He Urges 
Investigation Into Military-Chemical Complex Activities"] 
  [Text] Dr. Lev Fedorov has stated that he "would not give 
guarantees" that Russia has totally discontinued the production 
of chemical weapons. These conclusions, according to co-author 
Vil Mirzayanov, are also suggested by the recent splash of 
events connected with "Mirzayanov case" and the reticence of 
officials unwilling to provide the public with details of the 
state of affairs in the military-chemical complex (MCC). 
  Lev Fedorov presented yesterday a report, "Chemical Weapons 
in Russia: History, Ecology, Politics." He stated in a press 
conference that "there are no forces in the government... that 
would regard seriously both the danger posed by the MCC, and the 
safety of the population. The government has not even started 
to solve the problems of getting rid of highly toxic dioxins; 
the questions we raised of elimination of liquid rocket fuel in 
the same class of danger as toxic substances also await 
consideration." 
  Lev Fedorov underlined that he and his colleagues "have so 
far received neither from the army nor industry any precise 
information on where and when they worked in Russia with 
chemical weapons. Society remains unaware of the size of the 
threat to our existence." In the opinion of Mr. Fedorov, people 
in Russia, and elsewhere in the world for that matter, "are 
being denied the opportunity to take an integral look at the 
country's military-chemical past and present: reserved for us 
are miserly crumbs of information. Meanwhile the MCC not only 
exists, but it is also totally unprepared to enter together with 
us into the next millennium; it cannot give up the idea that it 
can no longer hide the costly and highly dangerous chemical 
weapons toy, and that it will not be able to get a free ride on 
this any longer." Lev Fedorov stated that "it is necessary to 
campaign for the full declassification of documents once the 
country's leaders sign the convention renouncing chemical 
weapons, to look into our past and get rid of the old onus of 
secrets."

  [Text] Russia plans to build a new space launch center in 
its Far East by the year 2000, Commander of Military Space 
Forces (MSF) General Vladimir Ivanov told Interfax. 
  He said its launching pads for environmentally-safe 
new-generation boosters would provide all necessary orbit 
inclinations which can now be achieved only at the Baykonur 
cosmodrome situated in Kazakhstan. 
  During a meeting with military attaches of other countries 
outside Moscow on Wednesday, Ivanov gave an overview of Russia's 
military space forces, calling for greater space cooperation 
with Russia. He said the MSF had 50,000 persons as well as 
launch pads and equipment designed for testing space-related 
hardware and launch spacecraft with the help of Russian-built 
light, medium and heavy class boosters such as Kosmos, Tsiklon, 
Vostok, Soyuz, Molniya, Zenit, Proton and Energia. 
  On the fate of the Baykonur facility, Ivanov said "we are 
well aware of the need to resolve the problem and would like to 
see it functioning in the future."

<F P=106> [Interview with B. Gromov, deputy minister of defense of </F>
Russia, by V. Starkov; place and date not given: "`Our Army Has 
Its de Gaulles'"] 
  [Text] Colonel General Boris Gromov, Hero of the 
Soviet Union, needs no special introduction. Former commander of 
the 40th Army, he became renowned not only for having fought 
successfully in Afghanistan but also for having pulled the army 
out of there in militarily competent fashion, practically 
without losses. General Gromov is now deputy minister of defense 
of Russia. 
  [Starkov] You have a very handsome name. It resonates with 
something legendary. Do you know its historical roots? 
  [Gromov] I grew up in a family in which my ancestors, 
starting with my great grandfather, taught foreign languages. 
My father died at the front in 1943, two months before I was 
born. 
  [Starkov] Do you know any foreign language? 
  [Gromov] The curriculum at the Suvorov School in Saratov, 
where I was a student, allotted nine hours a week for the study 
of foreign languages. 
  In addition, for one whole day from reveille to taps 
everyone 
was required to communicate only in English or French. I once 
spoke English well. But to speak a language fluently you need 
constant practice, which I have not had for a long time. Taking 
part in negotiations, though, I still understand my partner. 
<H5>  `The Putschists Did Not Confide in Me' </H5>
  [Starkov] Following your return from Afghanistan, yours has 
been a complex fate. There have been ups and downs. There have 
continually been attempts to pin some labels on you and to 
involve you in something or other. You, on the other hand, 
remain one of the most outstanding and influential, but at the 
same time enigmatic political figures. 
  [Gromov] I have never shied from side to side or changed my 
position in deference to the current situation and have not 
bowed down before anyone. 
  [Starkov] On the eve of the August events you calmly went on 
leave. Does this mean that the putschists did not confide in the 
first deputy minister of internal affairs? 
  [Gromov] I was lucky, they truly did not confide in me. 
Because had they done so, they would have let me into some of 
their plans. 
  And then I was simply called back from leave and told: Come 
on, call off the troops. That is, attempts were made to make me, 
at my age and in my position and rank, a pawn. 
  Do you know what the internal troops are? They are units 
specially trained for street fighting. And then, based on my 
actual experience, I realized what was brewing and to what this 
could lead. And when I saw that these people, Yanayev, Pavlov, 
and the others, had made it their aim to seize the White House, 
which no one needed, I understood conclusively that this was all 
just an adventure. 
  [Starkov] You did not support the Emergency Committee. In 
other words, you felt that the time of Gorbachev, Yazov, and 
Kryuchkov was up? 
  [Gromov] Perestroyka, which was pursued without any plan 
whatever, could not have produced positive results. A true 
politician should not resemble a soccer player, who runs faster 
than he thinks. 
  [Starkov] For a long time you were the personal 
representative of Marshal S. Akhromeyev in Afghanistan and, 
evidently, knew this person well. Are you not tormented by the 
mystery of his death? 
  [Gromov] Marshal Akhromeyev was, in my view, the conscience 
of the armed forces. A soldier of the front, he had devoted his 
whole life to strengthening the country's defense capability. He 
did a great deal for the army, particularly as chief of the 
General Staff. He was a very intelligent and most punctilious 
and decent person, who knew his business. 
  The collapse of the system was a real drama for people of 
the 
older generation, and for Marshal Akhromeyev, a tragedy. I do 
not believe he was afraid of being put on trial. He simply could 
not reconcile himself to the fact that everything he had lived 
for and had sacredly believed in would be demolished. 
<H5>  Afghanistan </H5>
  [Starkov] Why did you go there a second time? 
  [Gromov] Marshal Akhromeyev had proposed that I head the 
group of representatives of the General Staff in Afghanistan. He 
needed unembellished reports on the actual situation in the 
country. In other words, use was made of the experience of the 
Great Patriotic War, when representatives of the General 
Headquarters endowed with special powers operated at the fronts. 
  [Starkov] What do you think, why was such a big country as 
the Soviet Union with a most powerful army not the winner in 
Afghanistan? Could we, generally, have won the Afghan war -- 
there was already the experience of the Americans in Vietnam, 
after all. 
  [Gromov] Defeating a people by way of arms is impossible. In 
addition, this was not the mission given the limited contingent 
of Soviet troops. The 40th Army was to have supported the 
revolutionary regime in Kabul, neutralized the armed opposition 
detachments on the country's territory, and prevented their 
penetration of Afghanistan from abroad. 
  [Starkov] It would be sinful not to ask you about Rutskoy. 
Did you know him from Afghanistan? 
  [Gromov] Of course. And, as army commander, I participated 
most actively in his release from captivity, when he had been 
shot down for the second time. 
  We had no news of him at all for several weeks. Thinking 
that 
Rutskoy, deputy commander of the army air force, had died, I 
signed a recommendation for the posthumous conferment on him of 
the title of hero. Shortly afterward, military intelligence 
agents managed for a very large amount of money to learn that he 
had been taken prisoner, ascertained where he was, and 
immediately began to negotiate for his release. 
  [Starkov] So Rutskoy was ransomed? For how much? 
  [Gromov] It was a large ransom--several million dollars. But 
when it is a question of a human life, no money is begrudged. 
Besides, Rutskoy was an excellent pilot. But pilot and 
politician are different things. 
<H5>  Last October </H5>
  [Starkov] So, blood is the symbol of the 1970's, 1980's, and 
1990's. The military tried to avoid bloodshed both in 
Afghanistan and in August 1991. Could you not clarify the 
situation--what happened in October 1993? 
  [Gromov] I can say nothing in this connection because I was 
not a participant in the October events either. Nor was I 
present at the well-known nighttime session of the Ministry of 
Defense Collegium. 
  [Starkov] You were not invited? 
  [Gromov] I was simply not there, I could not get there. 
Operational-strategic exercises codenamed Zapad began in the 
armed forces on 21 September, when the edict of the president 
was promulgated. Practically all forces stationed in the west of 
the country were taking part. These exercises had been planned 
back at the start of 1993. I first heard about the edict in 
Kaliningrad, having hardly disembarked from the airplane, from 
correspondents, who just about knocked me off my feet. They were 
demanding comment, and I did not understand what they were 
talking about. 
  [Starkov] You evidently weighed up the scenario in the 
October situation, for all that. Let us suppose that the army 
did not intervene. What would have happened next? There they are 
in the White House, we are here, the president is in the 
Kremlin.... 
  [Gromov] It is essential to use the internal troops in such 
a 
situation. First, this is required by the law. Second, MVD 
troops are stationed in Moscow and in the vicinity, there are 
practically no army units in the capital. They are stationed far 
beyond the city. 
  The Dzerzhinskiy Internal Troops Division, in particular, is 
specially intended for operations in emergency situations on the 
territory of the capital. This is a crack formation. The 
servicemen--from the soldier through the commander of the 
division-- have excellent professional training. Special 
subunits of the Dzerzhinskiy Division can in their helicopters 
be at any point of Moscow within 10 minutes, provided there is 
somewhere to land. 
  [Starkov] It is known that you and Yazov had a difficult 
relationship. How is it shaping up with the present defense 
minister? 
  [Gromov] Normally; we were in Afghanistan twice, for that 
matter. At first I was a divisional commander, he, deputy 
regimental commander. Then I was appointed commander of the 40th 
Army, General Grachev, commander of an airborne division. 
  [Starkov] Are there often attempts to set you at odds? 
  [Gromov] Yes, it should not be forgotten that we live in 
Russia. 
<H5>  Military Diplomacy </H5>
  [Starkov] Your name does not correspond all that well to 
your 
image. You are not in principle a "loud" person--you are never 
at the center of rows. What issues do you handle in the Ministry 
of Defense? 
  [Gromov] I am responsible for all negotiating processes and 
relations with countries of the near abroad. 
  [Starkov] Which CIS republic has given you the most 
difficulty? 
  [Gromov] It is difficult everywhere. For a very long time we 
were unable to find a common language with the leadership of 
Ukraine. Problems of the use of strategic nuclear forces on the 
territory of Kazakhstan are proving hard to resolve. We are 
extremely concerned at the situation of the Russian-speaking 
population in the Baltic. The development of the situation in 
Tajikistan is causing particular concern. Events there are 
developing literally according to the Afghan script of 15 years 
back. Lest Russia become tied up there the same as in 
Afghanistan, it was decided to create in this region a coalition 
force with the participation of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan. 
  [Starkov] You often travel overseas together with Kozyrev. 
Are there some subtleties in relations between you? Or do you 
attend the negotiations as representatives of two different 
departments and try not to notice one another? 
  [Gromov] Good interaction has been worked out, in my view. 
It 
is easy working with him--he is a composed and thoughtful 
professional. 
  [Starkov] Is the foreign minister a democratic individual? 
  [Gromov] Yes, but fairly strict also, perhaps. 
  [Starkov] You, more than other generals, are connected with 
policy, including foreign policy. Are you thinking of continuing 
your political career? 
  [Gromov] No. 
  [Starkov] It is precluded for you? 
  [Gromov] I am a professional military man and wish to deal 
with my field. 
  [Starkov] Do you know any promising people in the army? Are 
there such persons in the Ministry of Defense leadership? 
  [Gromov] Marshal Ye. Shaposhnikov declared recently on the 
"Commanders" program that he does not see a single de Gaulle in 
the army. There has to be. Especially since the Russian and 
French armies have a great deal in common. 
  [Starkov] Does this mean that a military dictator could 
emerge here, as in Chile? 
  [Gromov] De Gaulle was not a dictator, Chile is not Russia. 
When I left Afghanistan, in 1989, then from 1989 through 1991, 
everyone was prophesying that I would be a dictator. But I was 
convinced even then that dictatorship in Russia was out of date. 
At least, there are none such in the military, I believe. It is 
simply that after all the recent events, a person who would 
venture to assume such colossal responsibility will not be found. 
  [Starkov] How many are there in the Gromov family? 
  [Gromov] My wife and I have four children: Maksim, Andrey, 
and the twin daughters Valechka and Zhenechka. The eldest, 
Maksim, already has his own twins--a boy and girl. So in this 
respect I am a wealthy man. 
  P.S. General B. Gromov's book "Limited Contingent," chapters 
from which the paper intends to familiarize readers with in a 
coming issue, will be published by Progress Publishers at the 
start of next week.

Armenians are the majority of the population--are being 
violated. Tengiz Sigua, the former Georgian prime minister and 
now a deputy at the Georgian Parliament, speaking during the 
parliament session on 8 March, expressed serious concern 
regarding such accusations. It was stated during the session 
that unless urgent measures are taken this region of the 
Republic could become a second Karabakh. 
  It seems that the Armenians, who have always looked upon 
foreign territories with heinous intentions, have now coveted 
the territory of another neighbor. Unless their covetous 
approach is obstructed, they will continue to claim other 
territories.

  [Text] The Defense Ministry Press Service has reported that 
there is no end to the attempts by Armenia's Armed Forces to 
break through the defensive line of the Azerbaijani Army. The 
enemy has been attacking our positions in Fizulinskiy Rayon 
since yesterday. The Azerbaijani Armed Forces' units have 
succeeded in repulsing all these attacks. Having suffered heavy 
losses, the enemy was forced to withdraw to its initial 
positions. 
  The shelling of our cities in the northwest of the Republic 
from Armenian territory is continuing.

  [Text] Murad Petrosyan, chief of the political section of 
the Nagorno-Karabakh defense army, believes that Baku's official 
assurances of its adherence to the cease-fire agreement since 
March 1, reached under the mediation of Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev, are of a purely propagandistic nature. 
  In his interview with Interfax, he reported that shelling of 
Karabakh positions is going on every day. Moreover, in his 
words, "while waging active offensive operations, the 
Azerbaijani party deliberately creates obstacles on the way to 
any peacemaking efforts by referring to the existence of various 
approaches to settling the conflict: CSCE's and Russia's one." 
  Petrosyan expressed conviction that "if to throw away the 
screen of words and to judge just by deeds, then it becomes 
clear that Baku's true goals remain the same, to force a 
solution of the Karabakh problem by military means." 
  That is why, Petrosyan said, the Karabakh party is so 
anxious 
with respect to guarantees and provisions for Nagorno-Karabakh's 
security and is circumspect about peaceful statements voiced by 
Azerbaijani leaders.

  [Text] Moscow, 10 Mar -- One of the conditions for a 
settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict is the 
liberation of the Azerbaijani territory seized by the Armenians. 
This was stated at a news conference today in Moscow by Ramiz 
Rizayev, Azerbaijan's ambassador to Russia. He noted that the 
main difference between the warring sides over implementation of 
the protocol on a cessation of military actions and the 
withdrawal of troops from l March this year, which was signed on 
18 February by the Azerbaijani and Armenian defense ministers 
and a representative of the armed formations of Nagorno-Karabakh 
under the mediation of the Russian defense minister, is 
disagreement over the starting points for the withdrawal of 
troops. 
  According to the ambassador, the Armenian side believes that 
the troops should be withdrawn from the positions they now 
occupy. Azerbaijan is insisting that the administrative boundary 
of Nagorno- Karabakh be accepted as the starting point for the 
withdrawal of troops. 
  To achieve peace, it is, first of all, necessary to have a 
cease-fire and for Armenian troops to withdraw from the 
Azerbaijani territory they have seized, and then for the troops 
to be separated and a mutual security zone created under the 
strict supervision of mediators and observers, the ambassador 
said. Only after these conditions have been fulfilled, will it 
be possible to get down to a political dialogue and to seek ways 
to reach a comprehensive settlement of problems, Rizayev noted. 
He denied reports that mercenaries from Russia are fighting on 
Azerbaijan's side. "We have sufficient manpower of our own. If 
there are Russians fighting, they are inhabitants of Azerbaijan 
or those who remained there after the reorganization of the USSR 
army," Rizayev said. He also rejected reports about the 
involvement in Azerbaijan's army of mercenaries and advisers 
from Iran, Turkey, and Afghanistan. 
  Asked by the ITAR-TASS correspondent about the possibility 
of 
Russian peacekeeping forces being introduced into the conflict 
zone, the ambassador noted that "we have nothing against this in 
principle, but it would be desirable to involve the peacekeeping 
forces of other states so that it is not only Russian 
peacekeepers that are put at risk."

  [Text] Moscow March 10 TASS -- The issue of joint 
protection of CIS external borders on Azerbaijani territory 
cannot be addressed until after Nagorno-Karabakh settlement and 
liberation of the Azerbaijani lands seized by Armenia, 
Azerbaijan's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary in 
Russia Ramiz Rizayev said in an exclusive interview with TASS on 
Thursday. 
  "There is no external threat to Azerbaijan at the moment, a 
threat comes from inside the CIS, from Armenia", the ambassador 
stressed. According to him, under the present circumstances 
Azerbaijan's borders with Turkey and Iran should be regarded 
first of all as its external borders, and only then as external 
borders of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  Last September, Azerbaijan became a full-fledged member of 
the Commonwealth and joined the Collective Security Treaty. 
However, no mutually acceptable schemes for ensuring the safety 
of Azerbaijan's boders with Turkey and Iran have been worked out 
so far. These borders are virtually transparent at present.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] As we know, the 17th round of Russo-Estonian talks, 
which was held recently, produced no specific results 
whatsoever. The talks merely complicated relations between the 
two states still further. The negotiations are bogged down over 
the question of 11,000 military pensioners who wish to go on 
living in Estonia. Since over half of these retired personnel 
are younger than 60, Tallinn considers that they pose a threat 
to Estonia's national security. It says the question of the 
pensioners cannot be linked to the withdrawal of the last 
contingent of Russian troops, 2,500 men in all. 
  However, the Russian delegation has refused to sign the 
withdrawal agreement unless the question of the pensioners who 
want to stay on in their apartments is first resolved. 
  After the failure of the last round, Tallinn initially 
intended to suspend the negotiating process in order to draw 
world attention to the problem. However, a meeting of the 
cabinet made a different decision. It adopted a statement, 
accusing Russia of trying to destabilize the situation in the 
Baltic region, but calling on Moscow to start consultations -- 
at a high political level, as it was put.

  [Text] At a third reading the Riigikogu [parliament] has 
adopted a law on collecting, registering, maintaining, and using 
materials of foreign countries' security and intelligence 
organizations which operated in Estonia, and which were put 
together prior to 1 January 1992. The law deals with materials 
both located in Estonia or removed from here, which contain 
information about the local population's activities and 
repressions, as well as materials dealing directly with foreign 
countries' intelligence activities. 
  According to the law, these materials are the property of 
the 
State of Estonia. The collecting, registering, maintaining, and 
using of intelligence materials are the tasks of the state 
secretary and the archives department's director general. 
Everyone has the right to familiarize themselves with the 
materials kept about them at the archives. Everyone who has 
materials about foreign countries' intelligence services in 
their possession must inform the archives department within 
three months from the inception date on the law on intelligence 
materials and hand them over by the date set by the department. 
  Enn Tarto, who presented the law and who is chairman of the 
temporary commission investigating the activities of foreign 
countries' intelligence and security services, told ETA that the 
law regulates first and foremost the use of materials of the 
former USSR State Security Committee and its subsiduaries, as 
well as those of other countries' intelligence. According to 
Tarto, the law will also protect people from incorrect quoting 
and extracting material out of context. Tarto acknowledges that 
even though Estonia made repeated applications for the return of 
all intelligence materials removed from Estonia to Russia, the 
return of such materials is possible on the strength of the 
basic agreement on a mutual exchange of culturally valuable 
articles concluded in 1993.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 09, BNS -- The growth of the 
collateral of Estonia's national currency in February sank to a 
record low for the whole period after the monetary reform of 
June 1992, a report by the central bank shows. 
  The Estonian kroon's collateral amounted to 5,373.7 million 
kroons, or about 392 million U.S. dollars as of Feb. 28. 
  The gold and hard currency reserve increased only by 32.5 
million kroons in February. The growth was also relatively low 
in January, 104 million kroons, when compared with the highs of 
more than 400 million kroons for certain months after the reform. 
  The central bank issued 15.6 million kroons in cash last 
month, bringing the total value of cash in circulation to 
2,793.9 million kroons. Banks' assets at the central bank 
decreased by 16.5 million kroons to 1,139.7 million kroons. 
Bank of Estonia's capital and reserve increased by 33.4 million 
kroons to 1,440.1 million kroons. The bank's own capital and 
reserve currently make up 26.8 percent of the total gold and 
hard currency reserve. 
  The Bank of Estonia on Tuesday [8 March] released the 
balance 
of the Estonian kroon and the bank's own business standing as of 
Feb. 28. The bank in comments to the report says 30 million 
kroons in the central bank's profits of 1993 were transfered to 
the state budget at the end of last month. 
  The central bank's balance sheet shows the value of 
Estonia's 
gold reserve stable at 44.7 million kroons. The stock of 
foreign hard currency rose by 41.4 million kroons, now amounting 
to 7,719.7 million kroons. Estonia's SDR (Special Drawing 
Right) account with the International Monetary Fund [IMF] 
declined slightly and is reported at 746.1 million kroons. 
Estonia's participation in IMF remains unchanged at 837.0 
million kroons, the assets also include 105 million kroons worth 
of bonds. 
  The loans issued are reported down by 60.1 million kroons, 
now at 422.6 million kroons. Credits provided to the government 
account for 45.2 million of that. Shares and involvements held 
by the Estonian central bank make up 62.5 million kroons, and 
capital assets, 36.9 million kroons. 
  The central bank's assets total 6,983.4 million kroons, down 
58 million in a month from the end of January. 
  Cash in circulation, 2,793.9 million kroons, accounts for 
the 
greatest part of the bank's liabilities. The IMF's national 
currency support account in the Bank of Estonia totals 1,590.4 
million kroons. Other banks' accounts and other current 
accounts have decreased 16.5 million kroons from January and now 
make up 1,139.7 million kroons. 
  The Bank of Estonia's capital and reserve make up 1,317.6 
million kroons, and foreign debts, 136.6 million kroons.

  [Text] Drafting Tallinn's 1994 budget is very difficult as 
the city's expected income has decreased almost twice, Tiit Vhi, 
ex-premier and the current council chairman of Estonian capital, 
told ETA on Thursday [10 March]. In 1993, Tallinn's income was 
almost one billion kroons, but this year only some 525 million 
kroons are expected to be collected from taxes. 
  "The state tied Tallinn's hands behind the back and took 
away 
its wallet," Vhi said while adding that 81 percent of taxes go 
to the state while only 19 percent is left at the disposal of 
local self-government. 
  Tallinn produces 76 percent of the country's sales tax and 
entrepreneur's tax and half of private persons' income tax while 
only one third of the country's population lives in Estonia, 
Jaak Tamm, the Mayor of Tallinn, told ETA. 
  Tallinn is more or less Estonia's tax base, Tamm said while 
accusing the government in attempts to revitalise centralization. 
  "The importance of the state is continually growing along 
with the centralization of resources and their state-controlled 
distribution -- planned economy in its essence," Tamm said.

  [Text] According to the press center of the Georgian 
Interior Ministry, a powerful explosion shook the headquarters 
of the Georgian Saviors' Corps in Tbilisi. The corps formed of 
members of the paramilitary Mkhedrioni group is led by Jaba 
Ioseliani. 
  Part of the building was destroyed. According to preliminary 
reports, two persons were killed and several wounded. More 
victims can be hidden under the debris. The Georgian Interior 
Ministry has launched an investigation. 
  This was not the first act of terrorism in Georgia this 
year. 
  On January 28 in Rustavi to the south of Tbilisi the chief 
of 
a local branch of Mkhedrioni Temur Talakhadze was killed in a 
barber shop. A bomb was planted under his chair. 
  On February 3 the deputy defence minister Niki Kekelidze 
died 
in an explosion in his own house in Tbilisi. The same day 
defence minister Georgi Karkarashvili was shell-shocked by 
another blast.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 10 Mar -- The Georgian parliament adopted a 
resolution today to disband the Abkhaz Supreme Soviet, having 
qualified its election in July 1991 as a breach of civil rights. 
It also abolished the law on the elections of the autonomous 
republic's representative body, adopted by the Georgian Supreme 
Soviet on 9 July of that year, during Zviad Gamsakhurdia's rule, 
which stipulated a quota for deputies of Abkhaz ethnic origin 
higher than the total number of all other deputies. 
  A decision was also taken to transfer the functions of the 
Abkhazian Supreme Soviet to the Abkhaz council of ministers in 
exile, which is based in Tbilisi, having determined its status 
as a temporary body.

  [Text] Georgian-Abkhaz talks on settlement of the Abkhaz 
conflict which started at the UN headquarters on 7 March ended 
without success, said Alvaro de Soto, the chief political 
adviser to the UN secretary general. He said that on Wednesday 
evening, at the closed consultations of the Security Council, 
the UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali told the members of 
the Security Council that the Georgian-Abkhaz negotiations which 
had been under way at the UN headquarters since 7 March ended 
due to unavailability of good prospects for reaching an 
agreement. There is not a single agreement signing which could 
be possible, said de Soto. According to him, Georgian-Abkhaz 
negotiations would probably resume in Geneva next month.

  [Text] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze reported by 
telephone from the United States to the press secretariat in 
Tbilisi that for the moment the UN Security Council has not 
adopted a resolution on sending international peace-keeping 
forces to Abkhazia. 
  According to Shevardnadze, one of the main problems is 
financing. True this issue was practically decided during Eduard 
Shevardnadze's meeting with the U.S. congressmen and the 
President in Washington. It is precisely the United States that 
will take upon itself the main part of the financing of the 
international peace-keeping forces. 
  After ending his visit to the United States, Eduard 
Shevardnadze set off for Canada.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 10 Mar -- According to Iberia news agency, 
the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has circulated information, according to 
which Armenian Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan said at a news 
conference in Moscow: "Georgians must come to terms with the 
idea that they shall not have the gas which is sent from 
Turkmenistan for Armenia. The situation in connection with the 
Armenian minority in Georgia is becoming tense. Very soon the 
issue of Javakheti [south Georgia] will rise and it will assume 
the scale of the Karabakh conflict." 
  In this connection, Van Baiburt, chairman of the charity 
Society of Armenian Culture in the Republic of Georgia, and 
editor in chief of the `VRASTAN' newspaper, in conversation with 
an Iberia correspondent, has said that he is aware of the good 
will for Georgia cherished by Armenia's President Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan and his colleagues, and that it enables us to 
assert that the statement published in the Russian mass media is 
yet another attempt by the third force to strain the relations 
between Armenia and Georgia. Van Baiburt also notes that the 
letter of protest sent by the Armenian foreign minister to the 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper is proof of this interference. 
  "A large part of the Armenian population knows very well 
that 
the Georgian authorities are not to blame for blocking the vital 
raw material to Armenia, although the Armenian opposition is 
over-suspicious and considers that it is being done 
intentionally, and is allegedly the result of a Georgian-Azeri 
alliance," said Van Baiburt. 
  According to Baiburt's opinion, the third force wishes to 
wage a conflict between Armenia and Georgia and therefore it is 
necessary to carry out a very smooth policy which completely 
contradicts deputy Tengiz Sigua's statement at a parliament 
session. 
  "Georgian and Armenian people are wise and will not be 
beguiled into these provocations," concluded Baiburt.

  [Text] Georgian sabotage groups continue to operate in 
Abkhazia, a spokesman for the Abkhaz mission in Moscow told 
Interfax referring to the country's Interior Ministry. 
  In a recent terrorist attack on the mountain village of Naa 
in the Ochamchira region, several members of the Mengrel ethnic 
group accused by Georgia of sympathy for ex-president Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia were killed. Fourteen houses were burnt down. 
  The village is now under the control of Abkhazian troops and 
investigations are under way. Police officials say that a 
portable radio, documents and personal belongings of Georgian 
soldiers were found on the scene. 
  Abkhazia's interior Minister Givi Agrba accused Georgian 
security services of launching sabotage attacks to try to 
unsettle the situation in the republic.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev by </F>
correspondent Nikolay Svanidze; place and date not given; from 
the "Details" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Svanidze] One knows that to a large extent Richard 
Nixon discussed his meetings in Moscow with the present U.S. 
leadership, including Clinton, as far as I understand. Another 
thing, at a time when Yeltsin himself was in opposition, he had 
meetings with top officials from other countries and received 
them here. There were no problems then. What offended Boris 
Nikolayevich this time? Why did he not receive Nixon? 
  [Kozyrev] I think the explanation here is very simple. I, 
for example, heard that Nixon was in Moscow when he had already 
arrived in Moscow. That is, the problem here lies in the 
organization [of the visit] and Nixon should ask people in his 
apparatus and, perhaps, complain to those people who invited him 
to Moscow -- I don't know who it was, who was dealing with his 
visit here -- as to why his program had been so ill thought-out. 
  There is a certain protocol. Protocol means certain respect 
toward a state in question. The president was absolutely right 
when he did not receive Nixon, because at the basis of his 
program was disrespect toward Russian statehood, toward the 
Russian state. 
  You know, his wanting to meet Rutskoy is roughly equivalent 
to someone arriving at a respectable gathering and -- forgive me 
for the analogy, but this matter needs to be presented quite 
graphically -- wanting to use the toilet. One option is to say 
excuse me, I will go out for a minute to make a telephone call 
to my close friend. Everyone will understand this and there 
will be no problem. Another option is to open wide the doors, to 
begin with this and join the guests coming out of the toilet. 
It is likely the guests will be offended. This is the whole 
problem. 
  I think the problem does not lie in the fact that he has met 
the opposition representatives or people who are more like 
criminals rather than the opposition in this particular context. 
The whole problem is that he did it wrong as regards 
priorities, politeness, and good manners. I do not think this 
is his personal problem, of course. He himself, perhaps, is not 
even able to deal with such details. This is the problem of 
those, I stress this once more, who had organized his visit and, 
above all, his own apparatus. 
  [Svanidze] That is, this is the problem of his apparatus, 
his 
team, and those who invited him here, isn't it? 
  [Kozyrev] Absolutely correct. 
  [Svanidze] As far as I know, he was invited here by no one 
else but Mr. Lobov, secretary of the Russian Security Council. 
  [Kozyrev] You seem to know more than I do. 
  [Svanindze] Andrey Vladimirovich, Boris Nikolayevich's 
reaction -- can it be regarded as demonstration of toughness 
toward the United States? 
  [Kozyrev] No, this has nothing to do with the United States. 
I would like to tell you yet again that this problem was purely 
ethical, it was the problem of the program and the team. 
  [Svanidze] One gets the impression, many experts and 
political analysts, both Russian and non-Russian wrote this, 
that relations between the two powers have become colder now 
than what they were until very recently. 
  [Kozyrev] I am to meet Warren Christopher in Vladivostok in 
the very near future, and we will discuss with the secretary of 
state what form of partnership we should have. We should agree 
on this so that it does not cause annoyance and so that it does 
not come as a surprise, for example, when Russia comes out with 
its own initiative. 
  We, on our part, feel offended sometimes -- why do they come 
out with their initiative when we were supposed to agree on it 
between ourselves first. So this should be clarified and the 
mechanism of interaction should be finalized. I would not 
dramatize it but I would not underestimate it either. 
  If, on the other side there is simply a desire to undermine 
political partnership, and these are not simply problems of 
growing up, so to speak, problems of mutual adjustment, but if 
there is a political desire to give up partnership, this would 
be a different matter. But one should be convinced of this 
first. 
  [Svanidze] What is this new, tougher, more authoritative 
Russian policy linked to? Can it be explained by foreign policy 
or internal policy? 
  [Kozyrev] I would say neither the one nor the other. It is 
simply appearing in a perhaps more mature form in line with the 
restoration of the Russian state. But again, you know, we hear 
this cheap criticism that consists of saying that foreign policy 
is encountering certain difficulties. 
  But here it is forgotten that ours is a new state. We only 
adopted a Constitution in December. Before that we were living 
under the Soviet Constitution. You wouldn't know whether to 
laugh or cry reading such a mess. So at last, then, we got a 
new Constitution in December. 
  Our Russian statehood did, of course, take on a new quality 
-- an authoritative quality, if you like. We are now setting 
ourselves the full-scale task of strengthening the Russian state 
-- a democratic state, and foreign policy accordingly. 
Naturally, as the Russian state becomes more powerful -- and 
when we get on top of the economic reforms, we will have a 
powerful economy, whereas now our economy is weakened -- this 
will become apparent in foreign policy. Not because we want this 
or because we are under pressure from the opposition and so on 
and so forth -- nothing of the sort. The opposition only gets 
in the way of all of this. The opposition -- I mean the extreme 
opposition, so to speak -- is getting in the way of setting up a 
powerful statehood and consequently it weakens foreign policy. 
  You know, we are being constantly reminded of Zhirinovskiy. 
We are told: You are talking tough because you are being 
pressurized by Zhirinovskiy. Nothing of the sort. If we had 
not been accused of acting to Zhirinovskiy's orders or being 
under pressure from Zhirinovskiy, we would have talked even 
tougher. 
  [Svanidze] Do you think of yourself as a party politician? 
Do you think of yourself now as a member of Russia's Choice? 
  [Kozyrev] Well, let's not... 
  [Svanidze] Let's not what? 
  [Kozyrev] Let's not be specific about that. I was of course 
a member of the Russia's Choice electoral bloc, if you will. I 
have not rejected Russia's Choice, its common aims and so on. 
But Russia's Choice is not yet a party, and a complicated 
process to create a party as opposed to an electoral bloc is 
under way, along with a difficult process of, let us say, 
self-determination and crystallization of political currents, 
and so I would not now say that I belong to any specific party.

<F P=106> [Andrey Streletskiy report under the "Resonance" rubric: </F>
"Major Diplomatic Incident; This Is How American Press Assesses 
Russian Leaders' Refusal To Meet With Richard Nixon"] 
  [Excerpts] The American press is commenting on Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin's harsh statement that neither he, nor 
anyone around him, nor members of the Russian Government will be 
meeting with Richard Nixon, the 37th U.S. president, who is in 
Moscow. As many people know, such a decision was made in 
retaliation for Mr. Nixon's contacts that had taken place with 
prominent figures of the Russian opposition. [passage omitted] 
  In the meantime it is becoming clear that those close to the 
Russian president have different assessments of the harshness 
shown to the American visitor. 
  For example, Andranik Migranyan, member of the Russian 
Federation Presidential Council, does not see anything 
objectionable in the desire of an "aging" Nixon to get an 
objective idea of the political processes in Russia with the 
aid, among other things, of talking with representatives of the 
radical opposition in Moscow. 
  In this connection, Mr. Migranyan told an INTERFAX 
correspondent that "he is not quite clear" about the motives of 
Boris Yeltsin's refusal to receive Richard Nixon. "This is even 
less clear if there had been a previous agreement and promise 
from our side of having a meeting," he added. 
  Yeltsin's adviser thinks the trips by USSR President Mikhail 
Gorbachev to the United States, during which he freely 
communicated with officials and political groupings hostile to 
Bill Clinton, as an analogy are appropriate.

  [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the Liberal Democratic Party 
of Russia (LDPR) leader, told Interfax that the Russian 
president had been right in refusing to meet former U.S. 
President Richard Nixon. 
  In Zhirinovskiy's view, by meeting opposition leaders and 
former vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy, "who did not represent 
anybody," before sitting with the president, Nixon was 
"discourteous to the head of state." Meeting Yeltsin was 
expected to be the highlight of Nixon's visit. 
  Zhirinovskiy was not sure whether he would meet with Nixon. 
He did not have an official word on this but knew that such a 
meeting was on Nixon's schedule. 
  Zhirinovskiy made it clear that his country "never assumed a 
posture" or refused contacts. He said that his party had been 
invited to a reception in the U.S. Embassy Thursday night on the 
occasion of Nixon's stay in Russia. Zhirinovskiy's deputy in 
the LDPR and Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Aleksandr 
Vengerovskiy would attend the reception.

  [Text] Much of the media has recently been writing about a 
cooling off in the Russian-American relations. Can we call it a 
crisis now? Here is our commentator Aleksey Sokolov's view. 
  [Sokolov] Indeed, there are quite a few reports in the press 
on this. A lightweight diplomatic scandal is brewing between 
Moscow and Washington -- this is how IZVESTIYA, for instance, 
has headlined one of its articles. The article is about the 
possible negative consequences of the former U.S. President 
Nixon's visit to Russia, where, unfortunately enough, he had a 
meeting with the opposition before meeting the head of state and 
those who represent the administration. 
  The article's author does not rule out the emergence of new 
and substantial friction in the relations between Moscow and 
Washington. 
  State Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin did mention the rough patches 
that have recently been affecting the relations between the two 
countries during his recent visit to Washington. 
  Incidentally, I have so far failed to come across the word 
crisis, evidently because, when all is said and done, there is 
no crisis as such between Russia and the United States. It is 
more likely that other aspects do exist here -- it is simply 
that Moscow and Washington have begun to regard each other from 
more realistic positions. There is no doubt that Russia's 
vigorous diplomatic initiative in Bosnia took America by 
surprise. To detract from its undoubted impact, a jealous White 
House wheeled out the Ames' spy affair. Pleasantries were 
exchanged -- the Russian and American residents were expelled 
from Washington and Moscow. The United States began to fan up 
the spy hysteria in every possible way here. The halting of U.S. 
assistance to Russia was even mentioned. 
  Nevertheless, let me reiterate that there are no grounds to 
speak of a crisis in the Russian-American relations. It simply 
looks like the United States, which has adopted the unofficial 
title of the only superpower and which has recently gotten used 
to Moscow behaving in a certain predictable pattern on the 
international arena and to its role as a younger brother, as it 
were, has suddenly discovered that despite its own family 
difficulties, this brother has become stronger and more 
confident and that it intends its role in international affairs 
to be completely independent. 
  It is as though the United States has forgotten that in view 
of objective reasons, such as the size of its territory and the 
presence of nuclear weapons, Russia itself was, is, and will be 
a world power, with a voice and interests of its own. 
  No, it is not a matter of returning to the times of the Cold 
War. Russia is no longer ideologically hostile to the West -- 
but, having said that, it does have inalienable national 
interests with which, judging by everything, the United States 
will have to reckon in the nearest future. 
  As for America's interests, these can at times continue to 
coincide with the Russian interests or not, as the case may be, 
and if the latter is the case, rough patches are possible. 
However, the essence of the mutual relations between Russia and 
America ought to remain invariable. As Ivan Rybkin noted in 
Washington, partnership and cooperation in the name of peace and 
concord in the world represent the constant features of 
Russian-American relations.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in 
Russian at 0232 GMT on 10 March carries a report by ITAR-TASS 
correspondents Pavel Vanichkin and Vitaliy Chukseyev on a news 
conference held in Washington on 9 March by State Duma Chairman 
Ivan Rybkin regarding the results of his visit to the United 
States. Rybkin says he and his delegation of Russian parliament 
members had meetings with House Speaker Foley; Senators 
Mitchell, Dole, Pell, and Nunn; Defense Secretary Perry; Strobe 
Talbott; and "others." The final meeting was with President 
Clinton and Vice President Gore. 
  Rybkin says that "breaks in contacts between the legislators 
of such large countries as the United States and Russia" are 
"inadmissible" and that the Washington visit "has shown that 
Russian and U.S. members of parliament alike shared this 
conviction." 
  Replying to ITAR-TASS, Ivan Rybkin says he told the U.S. 
President and vice president and U.S. congressmen that a 
"qualitatively new situation was taking shape in Russia: 
Millions of property owners had appeared, some owning fortunes 
running into thousands of millions, others medium-size business 
people, and yet others owning small plots of land. That is why 
any rolling back of reforms and turning back is completely out 
of the question." 
  He says that currently he sees the Duma "as the most 
reform-minded branch of power in Russia." "Its members are made 
up by three quarters of the former government; many came to it 
from the presidential structures and occupy key posts in the 
parliament. If you look at the factions, many of them changed 
their names, but among their members are bankers and commerce 
people, legal experts and farmers, and that is why, when we come 
to adopt the most important laws that will clear the obstacles 
on the path of reforms, things will be much easier for us than 
for the former Supreme Soviet. However, there must be an 
awareness that without civic consensus, without cooperation 
between authorities, we cannot move an inch further. Those who 
failed to understand it are now beginning to understand. Even 
here, reading TASS reports, I see how the positions of those 
who, for example, were opposed to the adoption of the memorandum 
on accord, are beginning to change." 
  Rybkin speaks at the news conference about the importance of 
cooperation between executive, legislative, and judicial 
authorities in Russia and America, and says the 
intergovernmental commission chaired by Gore and Chernomyrdin 
would hold an exceptionally important meeting soon. 
  During the news conference Rybkin is asked how he views 
speeches by certain members of the Duma who paint a catastrophic 
picture of life in Russia while on foreign trips. He says 
everybody is, of course, entitled to their point of view. 
However, he says, I have always called for restraint and said 
that the personal views of deputies should bear some relation to 
what the people who elected them are thinking. Maybe they 
should visit their constituencies more often and go on fewer 
foreign trips. Then everything would fall into its rightful 
place, he says. 
  Rybkin is asked to comment on reports that the elections in 
Kazakhstan were marred by contraventions of the electoral rules 
and that this could give rise to serious problems. He says 
problems are cropping up along the entire length of our 
frontier, in areas where tens of millions of our fellow 
countrymen are living. However, he says, such problems should 
be resolved in a civilized way. If anyone tries to infringe 
people's rights, he will soon discover how much this will cost. 
Just look at those countries which tried to expel our fellow 
countrymen, he says. All their hi-tech industries have ground 
to a halt, and now they are turning to us once more for help. 
The rights of people living in various territories must be 
respected, irrespective of nationality, and these people must be 
represented on bodies of power in proportion to their numbers, 
he says. 
  During the news conference, members of the delegation 
representing different factions expressed totally opposite views 
on the recent political amnesty for those involved in events of 
1991 and 1993. In response to an ITAR-TASS correspondent 
question on whether the Russian delegation was united in its 
position at the talks with their U.S. counterparts or 
demonstrated similar differences of opinion, Rybkin says that 
whatever differences there are, if any, they are only over minor 
nuances. "On the principal issues in our life we were 
unanimous," he says. He concludes: "Our talks were precisely 
about the principal issues, the principles of Russia's relations 
with the United States. These principles have not changed. 
Their permanent feature is partnership and cooperation for the 
sake of peace and accord in the world, for the sake of the 
difficult reforms in Russia. We have agreed on many issues, 
worked out programs for cooperation and decided that mutual 
exchange of information should be full and frank so that there 
will be no rough patches in our relations, which usually appear 
when information is not complete."

<F P=106> [Report by A. Pishchayev on interview with State Duma </F>
Chairman Ivan Rybkin on his return from the United States; from 
the "Vesti" newscast -- Rybkin remarks recorded] 
  [Text] [Pishchayev] When State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin 
returned [from the United States], journalists wanted to know 
first of all how the United States had reacted to former 
President Nixon's meetings in Moscow with the opposition in 
Russia. 
  [Rybkin] We met President Clinton and Vice President Gore 
straight after this and did not notice any particular reaction. 
  [Pishchayev] Noting Yeltsin's refusal to meet Nixon, we 
asked 
if Ivan Rybkin was planning to see this guest during his 
unofficial visit from across the ocean. 
  [Rybkin] There is a reception at the embassy this evening in 
connection with Nixon's visit and Mr. Pickering, the U.S. 
ambassador to Russia, has invited me. But at 1800 there is a 
meeting of the Duma council and it will be awkward for me to 
leave. Perhaps one of my deputies will go. 
  [Pishchayev] On the subject of the results of his U.S. 
visit, 
Ivan Rybkin said he had brought back with him a package of 
agreements on cooperation in different fields between Russia and 
the United States. As for our being allocated additional 
financial aid: 
  [Rybkin] No one can help us more than we ourselves. The main 
thing is that we are not prevented from working to the maximum 
of our abilities. This is what we talked about, about the fact 
that, deliberate or not, there are hindrances from the U.S. side. 
  [Pishchayev] He also said that the recent Ames scandal -- 
the 
Russian spy couple within the CIA -- had been discussed during 
his visit. The Duma speaker said certain changes could be 
noticed in the U.S. attitude to this problem. He added: 
  [Rybkin] I am fed up with the fuss over these spies whose 
loyalties, whose ideology, so to speak, is not clear. When I 
was asked about this, I said: You have some very old people in 
your country, you could probably find a 90-year-old who was 
indoctrinated by the Tsarist secret police. Would Russia have 
to answer for this?

<F P=106> [Article by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev: </F>
"Russia and United States: Partnership Not Premature, But 
Overdue"] 
  [Text] Doubts are being voiced on both sides of the 
Atlantic regarding the possibility of Russian-U.S. partnership 
and Russian-Western partnership as a whole. 
  Some people are saying that it is premature. Others are 
talking about a return to rivalry. I would like to set out my 
stance in clear-cut terms straightaway: There is no reasonable 
alternative to partnership, unless of course you count the 
possibility of missing the historic opportunity to shape a 
democratic Russian state and transform the unstable 
postcommunist world into a lasting democratic one. Both these 
objectives are indeed interconnected. They are all too precious 
for Russia's democrats, who have already repeatedly encountered 
armed (not to mention furious political) opposition from the 
enemies of reform. We will continue to fight to secure these 
goals even if we are not heeded and correctly understood by our 
natural friends and allies, in the shape of the democratic 
states and governments of the West. In this respect, the 
threats to reduce economic aid to a Russia led by President 
Yeltsin are as futile as they are counterproductive. 
  The same can be said about the talk of the need to abandon 
"infantile pro-Americanism." If this were due to recognition of 
the need to finally have the Russian Embassy in the United 
States carry out diplomatic work on a professional, energetic, 
and systematic basis or to stop statesmen, including Russian 
parliamentarians, making pilgrimages to the United States, one 
might be able to agree with it. But people seem to want to see 
the attainment of maturity as abandoning the idea of natural 
partnership. But this is not maturity, but degeneration, an 
ill-disguised attempt to give up the very essence of radical 
reform -- in foreign policy too. I cannot agree to and I will 
not be involved in it! 
  The United States and the West can make an invaluable 
contribution to shaping a stable democratic world via the means 
outlined in the Vancouver and Moscow declarations that Russia 
and the United States signed at summit level. Namely the policy 
of strategic partnership. Strategic because we share common 
values, while Russian and U.S. national state interests 
regarding the main world problems not only do not conflict but 
complement one another. 
  In both Russia and the United States only reactionary forces 
in the military-industrial and bureaucratic complexes have an 
interest in wrecking partnership. They seek out mythical 
explanations, saying that Russia is doomed to totalitarianism 
and confrontation with the world outside, and East and West are 
incompatible. The reality is that we must move on to practical 
partnership. 
  At the same time we must abandon certain illusions. Some 
people in the West have indeed been daydreaming that partnership 
can be developed with Russia on the principle that "if the 
Russians are good, they must follow us in everything." There 
may also be romantics in Russia who thought that partnership is 
an idyllic situation without conflicts and problems. 
  I think that I and all pragmatic politicians realized from 
the very outset two fundamental facts. 
  First, as I have repeatedly said in my speeches both in the 
West and in Russia, including before the breakup of the USSR, 
the Russian Federation is condemned to be a great power. 
Aggressive and threatening under the Communists and 
nationalists, peaceful and prosperous under the democrats. But 
a great power nonetheless! Naturally this prompts the conclusion 
that it cannot be a junior partner but only an equal partner. 
  Second, partnership based on common values and even 
sympathies does not mean renouncing a firm or, if you like, 
aggressive policy of upholding your own national interests and 
sometimes of competition and disputes. 
  There is another dangerous illusion in the way of 
partnership. Namely the almost fanatical desire to see just one 
great power in the world today -- the United States -- and 
insistently proclaim American leadership. 
  First, the United States is not able to handle all the 
problems in the modern world on its own and would, I think, 
badly lose out by overtaxing itself in this way. Second, even 
though it is experiencing the difficulties of the transitional 
period, Russia will remain a superpower not only as far as 
nuclear missile and military might as a whole is concerned, but 
also in terms of space exploration and development of 
state-of-the-art technologies, not to mention natural resources 
and geostrategic position. Third, there are other centers of 
influence which mean that the world is not unipolar or bipolar 
but multipolar. 
  So what option is left for Russia's democrats when the 
question is formulated in these terms? Agreeing to play a 
secondary or subordinate role would be as unwarranted as it is 
politically dangerous. The extreme nationalist and reactionary 
forces involved in the domestic political struggle in Russia 
would immediately take advantage of this. They are in effect 
already trying to do so. Even my fellow democrats are already 
grimly joking that, whereas Gaydar was not around long enough to 
see considerable Western aid, Zhirinovskiy is already enjoying 
the fruits of the talk about it! 
  Russia and the United States in conjunction with other 
countries must set about tackling two interconnected tasks. 
First, the joint formation of a strategic partnership bolstered 
by the corresponding institutions and resources. Second, the 
immediate setting up of a mechanism for coordinating their 
actions in approaching the most important international problems. 
  Both tasks are easily illustrated by the example of NATO. 
The alliance was set up to repel Communism and consolidate 
Western democracy. This institution, good as it may be, is 
obviously inadequate and unsuitable for current purposes. NATO 
is not faced with communism, and Russia itself is not part of 
NATO. The "Partnership for Peace" program will provide a 
partial answer, but it cannot be considered the pinnacle of 
achievement. That was obvious during the crisis in Sarajevo. 
The NATO ultimatum was delivered without Russia, but it is 
quite plain that Russia cannot and should not be excluded from 
the general efforts to settle the problem of Bosnia, where it 
has considerable interests and potential. 
  There is a danger of putting too much emphasis on NATO and 
partnership with it to the detriment of the CSCE, a broader and 
more general-purpose structure. That would be a great mistake. 
It is the CSCE that should play the main role in making the 
system of Euroatlantic collaboration truly stable and democratic. 
  If all of us in East and West do not learn from the 
difficulties and disputes of the last few weeks and immediately 
develop a strategy and instruments for partnership, you can be 
sure that these difficulties will be exploited by those in favor 
of self-fulfilling gloomy prophecies.

<F P=106> [Maksim Yusin report: "Moscow Adopts Wait-and-See Position. </F>
Kozyrev Waits for Meeting with Secretary of State Christopher 
Before Expressing His Attitude toward Washington's Plan for 
Bosnia Settlement"] 
  [Text] In recent days the Russian capital has become a 
center of diplomatic activity. On 9 March Bosnian Prime 
Minister Haris Silajdzic and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate 
Granic visited Moscow, where they met with Andrey Kozyrev. On 
Thursday the head of the Italian diplomatic department began a 
visit, and on Friday his Greek counterpart is arriving. The 
main theme of all the talks is the situation in the Balkans. 
  After the Muslims and Croats reached agreement on the 
creation of a confederation in Washington last week, the 
impression was created that the United States is seizing the 
initiative from Russia in a Bosnia settlement. The outburst of 
Russian diplomatic activity is evidence of the fact that Moscow 
does not want to be pushed into the background. It has emerged 
from reliable sources that Vitaliy Churkin, President Yeltsin's 
special representative, will be setting off on another tour of 
the Balkans in the next few days, during which he plans to visit 
Zagreb, Sarajevo, and Belgrade. 
  Moscow is remaining silent over the Croat-Muslim agreement. 
When meeting with journalists at the end of the talks with 
Silajdzic and Granic, Kozyrev strenuously avoided any 
evaluations and expressed his thoughts as blandly as possible. 
Vitaliy Churkin did not offer any clarification either but 
stated that Russia "is continuing to study" the Washington 
accords and their possible legal consequences. 
  These "legal consequences" seem to have become a stumbling 
block not just for Russian diplomats. Both among the Croats and 
the Muslims the attitude to the Washington agreement, which was 
concluded under clear pressure from the United States, is mixed. 
"An historic precedent is being set. If part of a sovereign 
state (the Croatian and Muslim parts of Bosnia) enter into 
confederative relations with another state (Croatia) today, the 
Bosnian Serbs may cite that precedent tomorrow to demand a 
confederation with Yugoslavia and likewise the Kosovo Albanians 
with Albania. This will hardly be conducive to the 
normalization of the situation in the Balkans," a journalist 
from a major Croatian newspaper believes. 
  On Smolensk Square they have adopted a wait-and-see stance 
while they ponder the vast flood of conflicting information 
arriving these days. By all accounts, Kozyrev is waiting for 
the meeting with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, 
scheduled for Vladivostok on 14 March, to hear the U.S. 
argument, coordinate approaches, and only then formulate the 
Russian position. 
  What the West expects from Moscow is that it will again put 
pressure on its Serb allies to make them accept the Washington 
plan. Silajdzic and Granic tried to persuade Kozyrev that the 
Croatian-Muslim agreement is not aimed against the Serbs and 
that they can join the future confederation if they want. The 
Russian minister expressed satisfaction at the assurances that 
he received. 
  Meanwhile it must be presumed that both Kozyrev and his 
interlocutors are well aware that there is virtually no chance 
of winning the Serbs over and their leaders have already 
rejected the Washington treaty. Russia is hardly going to 
persist in its efforts to make them change their mind. Unless, 
of course, Christopher has some extraordinarily convincing 
arguments ready for the Vladivostok meeting.

  [Text] During his visit to Moscow, Foreign Minister 
Beniamino Andreatta said that Russia will be given a fuller role 
at the next G-7 summit in Naples. This is how Italy is trying 
to meet the Kremlin's demands to play a larger part in solving 
the world's major problems. Here is a report from Moscow. 
  [Begin correspondent Lucio Gambacorta recording] Minister 
Andreatta spoke about the crisis situation in Europe, first with 
President Boris Yeltsin and then in more detail with Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. Andreatta was representing the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, of which he is 
currently chairman. The talks were based around three main 
points: 
  1. The crisis in Yugoslavia and the Serbian position with 
regard to the new Croatian-Muslim federation. There was no 
mention of Italian blue helmets possibly being sent to Bosnia. 
  2. In the Baltics -- Andreatta left Moscow for Estonia this 
evening -- Italy wants the Russian minority's civil rights to be 
respected. 
  3. The G-7. Italy is preparing a program for the 
forthcoming Naples summit in July. Some members, especially 
Japan, are perplexed about the idea of widening the group to 
admit Russia, and Russia's bid to join the group of the most 
industrialized countries will have to be taken one step at a 
time. The Kremlin's foreign policy will no doubt be the subject 
of political discussions, but in Naples only seven nations will 
participate in economic talks. [end recording]

situation in Europe and the world, a statement issued by the 
presidential press service said. 
  Yeltsin stressed the need for joint collective activity of 
all countries in order to strengthen stability and security, and 
prevent and settle conflicts. The recent progress in resolving 
the situation around Sarajevo highlighted the importance of a 
coordinated policy of the international community, he said. 
  Speaking about the issues to be discussed at the upcoming 
G-7 
summit meeting to be held in Naples in July, the president 
expressed readiness to take steps aimed at developing closer 
cooperation and stick to the concept of G-8 in political 
interaction.

  [Text] Moscow March 11 TASS -- A spokesman of the Russian 
Counterintelligence Service confirmed on Friday that a Russian 
citizen had been arrested on charges of spying for Germany. 
  "As investigation is still under way we refrain from any 
comments", the spokesman told TASS on Friday and asked not to 
press for detailed information. 
  "In general I am against such inappropriate persistence of 
the press. We are doing everything which is in the interests of 
maintaining security of this country. We report about our 
successes when this does not impede our work", he said.

counterintelligence service press centre refused to comment on 
Thursday on media reports about the arrest of a German spy in 
Moscow. 
  Russian Intelligence Service spokesman Aleksandr Mikhailov 
told ITAR-TASS that these reports need to be checked and 
verified. 
  A German press and information department official told 
ITAR-TASS in Bonn that he did not receive any such information 
and therefore could not confirm or comment on the fact of the 
arrest of the German intelligence agent in Moscow who was said 
to have worked for the Bundesnachrichtendienst, Germany's 
intelligence service.

Baltic, and in 1995 and 1996 exercises involving land force 
units are to be held in Russia and in Germany.

  [Text] Today Russia and Ukraine resolved the conflict which 
has arisen because of Ukraine's gas debts and the delivery of 
Russian gas to Ukraine. Our team has only just returned from 
filming. 
  [Correspondent Zrelin] Throughout the whole of today 
difficult talks were held in Moscow in the Gazprom building. 
Even journalists invited to a news conference in the afternoon 
had to wait 90 more minutes. While cameras were being set up in 
the hall, the two sides were still defining their positions in 
the final document. 
  So, Russia and Ukraine have agreed on the joint utilization 
of the gas piplelines passing through Ukrainian territory and 
also the storage tanks for the natural fuel, with the subsequent 
sale of shares in them. It has been decided to introduce order 
into the debts issue within a month, that is by 10 April, and 
also to agree on the percentage of ownership of the gas 
pipelines and the storage tanks. 
  [Ukraine Vice Premier V.I. Landik] This year we will pay for 
gas only in money -- either rubles or hard currency -- but as 
for the 1993 debts here it will be 50-50; that is we will supply 
equipment and materials to Gazprom to cover 50 percent, and 50 
percent will be paid in money, either rubles or hard currency. 
  [Zrelin] Moscow and Kiev have also decided to toughen up the 
procedure for supplying fuel to consumers. This means that 
enterprises in Ukraine will receive gas only if they pay in 
advance. If there is no prepayment then there will be no gas. 
  [R.I. Vryakhirev, chairman of the board of Gazprom] If we do 
not introduce order together, I mean by 10 April, then gas 
supplies to Ukrainian consumers will be completely halted. 
  [Zrelin] It was also decided to in no way reduce export 
supplies since European consumers have already demanded large 
forfeits from Russia for non-fulfillment of contracts. Ukraine 
has also promised to no longer take gas from export pipes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, "leader of the </F>
Russian Liberal Democratic Party," by Vasil Popov; place and 
date not given: "Economy Reshapes State Borders"] 
  [Text] [Popov] In several places in Europe, you made 
statements about reshaping the existing state borders. How do 
you envisage this, if you do not intend to use military power? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Through economy. If the Yugoslav economy had 
not been destroyed, there would not have been any change of the 
borders and no new states would have emerged. Peace and calm 
would have continued to reign in Serbia and all of Yugoslavia. 
However, the economy was destroyed and we facilitated this by 
participating in the embargo. The embargo paralyzed every 
attempt to revive the economy and now a war rages and borders 
are being reshaped. The same applies to Iraq and Libya. 
  Let us look at Ukraine. It owes us a few zillions. Why 
should we forget this money? Kiev steals our gas, which is 
intended for Germany. The Germans are imposing fines on us, and 
thus we are being hit from both directions. This is economy? 
This is only friendship that still exists between certain 
leaders. 
  [Popov] During your visit to Bulgaria you spoke about 
returning certain territories to Bulgaria. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Bulgaria could take its territories back. We 
will not give them to you -- they are not ours. However, if 
Dobrudzha is Bulgarian, why is it in Romania? And if Thrace is 
Bulgarian, why is it in Turkey? I mean the return of your own 
territories, not the conquest of new territories by force. 
  [Popov] How could this happen? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] The Bulgarians alone should resolve this 
issue. Naturally, through economic means. However, your economy 
stagnates. Your chemical plants have been closed. Your resorts 
are empty. The workers of Vorkuta for example, could rest very 
well there. You owe Russia $70 million. Why do you not allow 
our workers to rest in Bulgaria in exchange of your debt? Our 
people will rest and you will pay your debt. 
  [Popov] There was a lot of noise about the political 
amnesty. The Liberal Democratic Party was one of the parties 
that initiated this amnesty. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Our program included an amnesty for all those 
arrested since 1986, and thus ending the perestroyka. Both 
sides made mistakes, and now the deputies, the government, and 
the people forgive. Let all those who are guilty begin by zero. 
The amnesty could only have a positive effect. Starting from 
the zero point we will seek ways of joint activity. The people 
have been freed and this is good. 
  [Popov] Do the former defendants have a political future? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] They should not have a political future. The 
victims who fell in vain in October, the destroyed families, and 
the emigrants should remind them of this. Khasbulatov went 
home. Makashov did the same. Dunayev said that he will devote 
himself to his wife, children, and motherland. This is good 
advice for all of them. However, everyone can participate in 
political life when it is based on the Constitution, i.e. to 
take part in the elections. Let them compete -- anyone could 
have a chance if he does not build barricades and does not 
accumulate weapons. They will begin now, while we already have 
an advantage. Let them try to reach and surpass us, as it 
happens in sports. 
  [Popov] People are talking about a crisis in the Liberal 
Democratic Party. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] This is disinformation. The entire country 
is in a crisis, and this affects all parties. It is like a car 
-- it moves, but releases gases and makes noises. The army also 
is in a crisis, but if necessary it will stop any eventual 
aggression. 
  [Popov] The budget was discussed recently. Will its 
adoption help Russia? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] The budget will not help Russia. Only a 
change of the political leadership will help Russia. In the 
summer or in the fall we will change the government and will 
begin a new policy in the country.

  According to the statement, Zhirinovskiy arrived in the 
Slovenian capital on March 6 "at an invitation of the local 
business community." In the airport "armed men who introduced 
themselves as officers of the Interior Ministry and security 
service but did not show any identity cards" told Zhirinovskiy 
that they were acting on the orders of the Slovenian Government, 
did not allow him to leave the airport, kept him there for 24 
hours and sent him back to Moscow. 
  The press service described the incident as "a cowardly 
provocation aimed at subverting the friendship of the two 
fraternal peoples."

<F P=106> [Interview with Oleg Kalugin, former Russian intelligence </F>
general, by Gabor Horvath in Moscow; date not given: "The 
Collapse of the Empire Provides More Work"] 
  [Text] Oleg Kalugin is perhaps the most famous former 
Russian intelligence official. Under journalistic and 
diplomatic cover, he worked a total of 12 years in the United 
States and then became deputy head of the KGB 
counterintelligence unit in Leningrad. Because of the strong 
accusations, declarations and disclosures from this unit, 
Mikhail Gorbachev stripped him of his rank of general and of his 
22 decorations, but he regained them from Yeltsin later. Oleg 
Kalugin appears in the Western press regularly. In the course 
of one of his visits in London, he was imprisoned for a short 
time on suspicion that he was connected with the 
Markov-assassination with the poisoned umbrella. Our 
correspondent interviewed him in the hall of an elegant hotel in 
Moscow. 
  [Horvath] Two years ago, Russian Intelligence Head Yevgeniy 
Primakov suggested that the United States and Russia mutually 
stop spying against each other. Was this a realistic offer? 
  [Kalugin] Not at all. I do not think it was a serious offer 
either, because neither the interests of the West nor the 
interests of Russia can be asserted without spying today. In 
addition, the intelligence services now have more work to do 
with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the former 
predictable and monolithic system. It is the obligation of the 
intelligence services to inform their governments about the 
potential threats coming from the enemies of reforms within 
Russia and from the peripheries that are in flames today. 
  We hope that the time will come when Primakov's offer can be 
implemented but, today, even clear allies like Israel, Japan, 
America, and France spy against each other. As for Russia, the 
tasks of our intelligence service have narrowed down, and there 
is a considerable difference between the former activity of the 
KGB and the current activity of the Foreign Intelligence 
Service. Formerly, we allocated tremendous energy to 
psychological warfare and to undermining the prestige and 
influence of our enemy. We are no longer engaged in such 
activity. 
  [Horvath] Is that true? 
  [Kalugin] I will explain why not: The CIA is no longer 
interested in Russia's disintegration and Yeltsin's fall. On 
the contrary, the United States is interested in maintaining and 
continuing the democratic changes. Nor is Russia interested in 
supporting communist parties all over the world. 
  [Horvath] However, Washington might oppose the idea of 
Ukraine and Belarus joining Russia again.... 
  [Kalugin] This does not fall in the jurisdiction of the CIA; 
they do not have so much power to decide on the fate of 
countries. One should not exaggerate the possibilities of 
intelligence. 
  [Horvath] In the current international politics, what is the 
role of the information obtained by various states through 
illegal means? 
  [Kalugin] Regarding today's Russia, the role of such 
information is extremely low. Our society is open now, and we 
hardly have any secrets. It is very difficult to keep back even 
the really confidential information. Nor is there any Russian 
secret policy against the United States, NATO, or the West. On 
the contrary, we would like to be the first to join NATO and 
precede all the other candidates. Today's intelligence service 
works more as an analysis center: It gathers and analyzes the 
information originating from various sources. 
  [Horvath] Where is the dividing line between a diplomat 
gathering information legally and a secret agent under 
diplomatic disguise? 
  [Kalugin] Honestly speaking, the difference is becoming 
increasingly smaller. For example, formerly we spent huge 
amounts of money to obtain inside information from the U.S. 
State Department, because the United States was interested in 
weakening the Soviet Union. We no longer have such motives. 
  [Horvath] Thus, the current spy hysteria is totally 
unfounded. 
  [Kalugin] The current American campaign is a rather 
hypocritical thing, because American agents are also active in 
Russia, and even within the KGB. There were people who were 
caught and condemned -- and even executed -- according to the 
law. But the Russian leadership never engaged in a noisy 
propaganda war. The Russian leadership regarded this as an 
"operational accident." True, I understand and partially excuse 
Clinton, because the U.S. conservative circles are suspicious of 
the too rapid rapprochement with Russia. After all, the loud 
declarations are only political gestures toward these circles. 
America is actually trying to help us, so the use of the 
principle of "tooth for tooth" would be irrational. On the 
other hand, intelligence is playing a considerable role in 
science and technology and in obtaining new markets, even among 
friendly nations. For example, Central Europe used to be the 
traditional market for the Soviet industry and it would not be 
fortunate to lose it. 
  [Horvath] What role could the intelligence service play in 
this? 
  [Kalugin] A wide role. It might seem unbelievable today, 
but I remember how proud the officials of the Hungarian 
intelligence were when they succeeded in obtaining some American 
types of corn with which one could increase production. At the 
time, we even looked down at them a little, although it really 
was an achievement, because they saved their country a lot of 
money. 
  [Horvath] Suppose that the Russian intelligence is also 
active in Central Europe. Is obtaining such economic 
information among its major tasks? 
  [Kalugin] Precisely so, and this is not aimed at forcing 
these countries back into the Warsaw Pact, because this would be 
a useless effort. 
  [Horvath] In other words, we are not talking about support 
for pro-Russian parties and influencing election results. 
  [Kalugin] This would only push Central Europe away from 
Russia. But there is sense in economic intelligence. For 
example, we learn that Hungarian-French talks are being held on 
the supply of certain products, while there is also a 
competitive Russian offer in that area. In that case, it is in 
our interest to discover the financial conditions offered by the 
French in order to lower our price and obtain or preserve our 
market positions. There is nothing morally condemnable in this. 
Moreover, intelligence services can even cooperate in the 
struggle against terrorism or drug trafficking, and then they 
actually contribute to some countries becoming closer to each 
other.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 09, BNS -- The Saeima (parliament) 
Economics, Agrarian and Regional Policies Committee looked at 
demands by the Feb. 24 trade unions congress to the Latvian 
leadership. 
  Trade unions want the government and the parliament to 
ensure 
the payment of wages detained in state-operated enterprises. 
The payments should be performed by May 1, the appeal said. 
  Unionists also suggest that the minimum monthly wages should 
be fixed at 58 lats to comply with the actual subsistence 
minimum. The crisis minimum should be 33 lats per month. 
  Deputies, however, said it was impossible to increase the 
minimum wages in the near future because the motion would 
require revision of the entire state budget. 
  Saeima is also unable to guarantee the payment of the 
detained wages by the required date. 
  The issue of wages is closely linked to the bankruptcy and 
liquidation of state sector businesses, said committee member 
Anna Seile. Saeima has passed two legislations ruling that 
payroll payments are priority obligations when an enterprise is 
liquidated.

  [Text] The Saeima today adopted a proposal by the Judicial 
Commission that the regulations adopted under Paragraph 81 of 
the Constitution by the Cabinet of Ministers, to the effect 
that, additional powers for the state police and Home Guard lost 
their force on the day after this resolution was announced. 
Before that the Saeima voted against these conditions, as a 
first reading of the bill, and also rejected the proposal from 
the Commission on Defense and Internal Affairs, returning them 
to the government for reworking. The regulations were adopted 
by the Cabinet in the last days of 1993, and were intended for 
police officers working together with the Home Guards, with the 
right to search detained cars and their passengers. 
  In the debate prior to the vote, Deputy Aristids Lambergs of 
the Latvian National Independence Movement stressed that the 
regulations adopted openly violate the rights of citizens of the 
Republic of Latvia and the principles of personal freedom. In 
turn, at a news conference after the vote, Latvian Way faction 
head Andrejs Pantelejevs welcomed all the racketeers and other 
(?kinds of) bandits whom the police officers and Home Guard will 
not be able to search when stopping their cars [sentence as 
heard]. 
  The Saeima also adopted on its first reading a bill prepared 
by the Commission on Defense and Internal Affairs on the 
National Security institution and the Bureau for the Protection 
of the Constitution. The Saeima rejected an alternative 
possibility, a bill prepared by the Cabinet on 
counter-espionage.

<F P=106> [Article by Anda Mikelsone: "The Number of Inhabitants of </F>
Latvia Will Decrease"] 
  [Text] Riga, 24 Feb -- Since the end of the 1980's, a 
steady decrease of the birthrate in Latvia can be observed. At 
the beginning of the 1990's, there was already a negative 
birthrate in the country. In 1993, the number of people living 
in Latvia decreased by 12,000. Last year, 27,300 babies were 
born -- 4,300 fewer than during the previous year. Currently, 
the birthrate in Latvia is lower than the European average. In 
addition, forecasts by Professor Peteris Zvirgzdins, head of the 
Statistics and Demographics Department at Latvian University, 
are not optimistic -- he predicts that the birthrate in Latvia 
may continue decreasing until the year 2010. 
  At the end of the last year, specialists from Latvian 
University completed a study entitled: "The Forecast for 
Latvian Demographic Development in the Period 1993-2003," in 
which data can be found outlining perspective demographic 
development in all of Latvia's regions and towns. According to 
this study, over the next 10 years the number of inhabitants 
will decrease by 142,000 people; in Riga alone, it may decrease 
by 108,000. 
  P. Zvirgzdins predicts that the birthrate could eventually 
increase, nearing the level necessary for generational 
replacement, but only after another 15 or 20 years, when people 
born in the mid-1980's begin thinking about having children of 
their own -- at that time, the birthrate was at its highest 
level: the number of babies born yearly was about 13,000-14,000 
more than the number being delivered today. 
  In addition, the overall birth coefficient, which indicates 
how many children a woman bears in her lifetime, has decreased. 
In 1986-1987, the coefficient stood at 2.15, but now it has 
already decreased to 1.4. According to P. Zvirgzdins, this 
figure can increase to 1.9 by 2003, but it still has to reach of 
level of at least 2.1 before generational replacement can be 
achieved. 
  The birthrate is also being considerably effected by the 
number of marriages, which has been decreasing over recent 
years. In 1993, 14,000 marriages were registered, and this is 
8,000 fewer than in 1991. At the same time, the number of 
dissolved marriages remains at a very high level; the highest in 
the world -- in 1992, 77 out of 100 registered marriages were 
dissolved, but in 1993 -- 71. 
  Last year, in comparison with the previous year, almost 
4,000 
more people died than in 1992. Plus, the average lifespan is 
also decreasing. According to P. Zvirgzdins, the average 
lifespan for a man in Latvia in 1988 was 66.3 years, for a woman 
-- 75.1 years; last year, men lived approximately 61 years, 
women -- 73 years. 
  P. Zvirgzdins is of the opinion that in great measure the 
reasons for the decreasing birthrate could be the present 
economic difficulties and the government's passive attitude 
toward the solution of demographic problems. Young couples are 
left to fend for themselves entirely.

Ministry of Internal Affairs, said that this treaty provides for 
German assistance to a value of 3 million marks to the internal 
affairs system of Latvia. Most of this sum is due to be used 
for acquiring communications equipment. At present a new 
cooperation treaty with the German Ministry of Internal Affairs 
is in preparation.

possible of the Baltic states into NATO and the European Union, 
Danish Minister of Defense Hans Haekkerup, who is currently 
visiting Lithuania, said at the meeting with Ceslovas Jursenas, 
Chairman of the Lithuanian Seimas. 
  The Danish defense minister made assurances of his country's 
help so that the Baltic states will be regarded in this process 
as equal with Romania and Bulgaria and not be placed behind them. 
  At the meetings between President Algirdas Brazauskas, 
Minister of National Defense Linas Linkevicius, and members of 
the Lithuanian Seimas, problems related to the strengthening of 
the Lithuanian state border, possibilities for joint military 
exercises, and assistance in setting up the Baltic peacekeeping 
battalion were discussed. 
  Apart from this, it has been noted during the talks that the 
first units of Lithuanian servicemen from the peacekeeping 
battalion would be able to join the peacekeeping process within 
the composition of the Danish forces deployed in Croatia. 
  On Thursday [10 February] the Danish minister of defense met 
the leaders of the Voluntary National Defense Force and visited 
Klaipeda where he met the commanders of the Lithuanian marine 
force, visited the port, and got acquainted with the technical 
equipment and armament of the fleet. On Friday the Danish 
defense minister and the Lithuanian minister of national defense 
are to sign a cooperation treaty.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 09, BNS - MP Romualdas Ozolas, 
chairman of the Lithuania Center Union, said he was surprised by 
the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry's apologies to the Polish 
Embassy in Vilnius. 
  The embassy last week presented a note of protest to the 
Foreign Ministry concerning Ozolas' statements in the 
Vilnius-based LIETUVOS RYTAS newspaper. 
  The lawmaker accused Jan Widacki, Polish ambassador to 
Lithuania, of "organizing active polonization" in Lithuania and 
called him "a Polish security employee." 
  The Polish embassy announced on Tuesday [8 March] that the 
Lithuanian Foreign Ministry expressed regret about the 
lawmaker's statements. 
  At a press conference Wednesday, Ozolas said he will meet 
Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys to discuss the incident. 
  In Ozolas' words, Polish newspapers wrote about Widacki's 
previous career. The lawmaker said he has documents to prove 
that the ambassador lectured in a Polish school of security 
officers. Hence, Ozolas said, it is possible to maintain that 
Widacki worked for the Polish security. The Lithuanian lawmaker 
said he will hand over these documents to Jurgis Jurgelis, head 
of the Lithuanian National Security Service. 
  Ozolas said the policy of the Lithuanian Government is 
surprising because Lithuania consents to the appointment of 
foreign ambassadors without paying any attention to their past. 
  The lawmaker said the recently appointed Belarusian 
ambassador is a former employee of the KGB. "I understand the 
interest of Belarus and Poland to appoint ambassadors who have 
experience of work in security systems, but I do not understand 
Lithuania's position."

utterances by Seimas member Romualdas Ozolas personally insult 
ambassadors of some foreign states. Ozolas publicly labelled 
the Polish and Belarusian ambassadors in Lithuania security 
officials. He also expressed his astonishment at Lithuania 
agreeing to the diplomats'appointments, disregarding their 
services to the former system. The Foreign Ministry stated on 
10 March that such statements are irresponsible and without 
foundations. This harms the right of choice by a neighboring 
state, complicates mutual relations between states, and 
humiliates the prestige of the Lithuanian state.

  [Excerpts] The fourth session of the Lithuanian Seimas 
opened today. Guoda Salciute describes the first plenary 
sitting: 
  [Salciute] The solemn opening of the fourth session did not 
take long. Seimas Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas greeted the Seimas 
members on the occasion of the opening of the spring session on 
the eve of the extraordinary day -- 11 March. [date of 
restoration of Lithuanian independence] [passage omitted] 
  President Algirdas Brazauskas addressed all members of the 
Seimas: 
  [Begin Brazauskas recording] Esteemed Seimas, I would like 
to share with you this festive mood in this hall today, on the 
eve of the fourth anniversary of the restoration of Lithuania's 
independence. I cordially greet you on this day which is very 
significant to our state and nation. A free independent 
parliament, which was called the Supreme Council then, elected 
on democratic principles, was formed four years ago. It has 
accomplished a great deal. Although it has not been working for 
very long, its steps are significant in our political life and 
in the life of our state. Firm parliamentary traditions were 
formed during that period in our state, and the second 
parliament, elected in a democratic and worthy manner, has been 
working for over a year. It has accomplished a great deal; we 
all read in the press and heard how many decisions and laws of 
very great importance to our state it has passed. 
  I would like to wish you in this fourth session, the spring 
session, hard work, adherence to principles, and wisdom in 
dealing with the affairs of our state and adopting laws and 
other documents, the list of which, as I have seen, is very 
long. These documents are of great significance to all spheres 
of our life, including domestic policy, economic reforms, the 
consolidation of the tax system and the legal system, and many 
other fields. 
  I would like to wish you successful work and good spirits. I 
hope you will not waste energy and wisdom there where good, 
common, bilateral or multilateral decisions can be achieved. 
Success to you all. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Bronius Genzelis, legislative deputy and member </F>
of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party: "The Negation of the 
State"] 
  [Excerpts] The overall destruction of the state is going 
on in Lithuania. The press is waging an intensive propaganda 
war against all government structures without exception (the 
Seimas [parliament], the president, courts, and 
self-governments). It seems that no positive changes have 
occurred since the restoration of independence in Lithuania. 
This idea is being promoted on all levels -- from the "16 
February" [Independence Day] to the "leftist" "oppositions" 
[reference to right and left radical forces]. The reader is 
being persuaded that Lithuanians are immature for their 
statehood (they vote for God knows who, most of them support 
those who do not deserve support, and so on). The supreme evil 
is the Seimas (formerly, the Supreme Council) which is composed 
of foolish and avid deputies. Money assigned for its 
maintenance is wasted. It follows from these speculations that 
elections are an unnecessary waste of finances, and that 
Lithuania does not need elected bodies. Was it better when 
strangers ruled us? Might the nation need a leader like the one 
[Landsbergis] offered at the 23 May 1992 referendum? Since 
citizens did not grant him unlimited powers, should not they put 
him in this post in some other way? 
  I am convinced that some of these propagandists do not even 
consider what they are proposing to the nation. 
  Another target of criticism is the national defense system. 
Is everything so black there as well? A campaign is being 
waged against the National Defense Ministry [KAM] and the 
Volunteer National Defense Service [SKAT]. Some people have a 
great temptation to bring the first organizers of our military 
structures to the bar. 
  Papers are publishing an increasing number of articles 
exposing our Army. Everything is bad there -- the Army is 
arbitrary and corrupt. We must understand, however, why we have 
such a situation, and look for ways of improving it. 
  I would like to ask the current KAM critics: Where were you 
earlier, and what was your role in creating military structures? 
Could our Armed Forces, albeit imperfect, emerge on another 
basis? 
  When our country had no international recognition, no state 
could legally support us with arms. If some country had tried 
to do this openly, it would have been condemned for interference 
in internal affairs. 
  The illegal arms trade is a dirty business. It is often 
linked with the criminal world. History does not know any group 
fighting for its country's independence which has not tried to 
acquire arms illegally, while there is no legal way. Therefore, 
criminal charges can always be brought against them later for 
the "illegal" acquisition of arms. [passage omitted] 
  While Lithuania was not internationally recognized, it was 
dangerous to work in its military structures, particularly 
without arms. There were no possibilities then to check every 
person coming to the defense system and find out where he or she 
had bought their arms. Criminals usually take advantage of such 
situations. 
  The Supreme Council Security Department, the SKAT, and the 
National Defense Department (later the KAM) emerged during the 
events of January 1991. There is no wonder that ordinary 
hooligans and thieves also found themselves there due to the 
lack of control. I am sure that the Russian secret services 
inspired many of them to join these structures. These services 
must have infiltrated their agents into our originating military 
structures. I think that these people have not disappeared. 
Unfortunately, we know little about their network. However, 
this is only one side of the moon. What about the other? 
  KAM and SKAT politicians of that time would impart hatred 
toward their own countrymen with different views rather than 
foreign invaders. They seemed to see enemies around every 
corner. I think that the future will expose those who spread 
hatred and their goals. 
  On the other hand, our military commanders did not allow 
themselves to be involved in political intrigues: They accepted 
the results of both the 23 May 1992 referendum and the October 
Seimas elections, even though some people wanted to annul them. 
  The staff of KAM, SKAT, and the Supreme Council Security 
Department behaved properly during those elections. Political 
tolerance and responsibility was coming into being. Power was 
being smoothly transferred from one political group to another. 
Our military commanders did everything to prevent 
"Georgian-type" developments in our country. [passage omitted] 
  Certainly, we must protect our military structures from 
further corruption. However, financial violations in the past 
and the present are two different things. 
  If we continue to bluntly attack the KAM, we will either set 
the Army against us or impart an inferiority complex to our 
soldiers, which would be ruinous to the state in either case. 
  Summarizing these observations, one can draw the conclusion 
that there are two groups of people interested in discrediting 
KAM and SKAT: 1) Those who failed to use military structures 
for their egoistic interests; 2) The enemies of our 
independence who would like Lithuania not to have even a 
symbolic force that could resist attempts to suppress our state. 
  Let us consider the following synchronous events: As soon as 
the external pressure increases, the "internal opposition" (from 
the Poles' Union to the Nationalist Party) becomes active. Both 
these organizations are extremely nationalistic. It would be 
understandable if they engaged in cultural issues. I do not 
think that these small organizations could raise a big commotion 
all by themselves. For example, the Vilnius Regional Council, 
guided by the Poles' Union, is stepping up pressure on 
Lithuanian schools. Such steps are nothing but provocations 
(there are many former enemies of Lithuania's independence in 
this union). Therefore, it is clear why Lithuanian citizens 
look upon this organization with suspicion. At the same time, 
the nationalists are shouting about new elections, the overthrow 
of the government, and so on. 
  This forces one to consider which groups are interested in 
Lithuania's unstable situation, and brings one to the conclusion 
that there are three such forces operating in our country. 
  The first force is the supporters of the restoration of the 
Russian empire. They want to discredit the very idea of 
Lithuania's statehood and persuade the world community (as well 
as the Lithuanians themselves) that Lithuania is immature for 
its independence. Therefore, they are disseminating the 
following idea abroad -- former communists have returned to 
power; chaos, poverty, and theft reign the country; it is 
dangerous for foreigners to stay here longer; there is no order 
in the country; or that Lithuania is capable of exporting only 
cheap prostitutes to the West. Thus, there remains nothing else 
but to return to the embrace of the Russian empire. 
  The second force is the "constructive opposition." Its 
single goal is to return to power by any means, without knowing 
what to do after that. Although this group is trying to 
discredit Lithuania's current government alone, actually it 
contributes to ruining not only government institutions but also 
the state itself. 
  The third force is the Mafia, which is completing its 
integration with the international criminal world. Mafia 
structures do not care about the color of the government. They 
seek to create corrupt authorities incapable of controlling the 
country's economy (the syndrome of a banana republic). 
  In reality (even though they do not seek this subjectively), 
the latter two groups serve the first one. I am sure that the 
first force has a network of its agents in the second two, and 
it can control the latter's actions through such measures -- 
destabilize the situation in the country as necessary. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 09, BNS -- 40 members of the ruling 
Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party faction have signed a petition 
demanding the resignation of Lithuanian Forestry Minister 
Gintautas Kovalcikas. 
  The campaign began earlier this year when ruling faction 
member Benas Rupeika alleged that the minister has relatives in 
some private timber export companies, which are granted 
considerable privileges compared to state-run timber exporters. 
Rupeika said there was no "adequate" reaction to his 
suppositions from the president and the premier. 
  The situation at the Ministry of Forestry and its branches 
was investigated by the State Control Department, which found a 
number of violations in state timber trade. 
  40 signatures are enough to include a vote of no confidence 
in the parliament's agenda. But observers suppose that 
Kovalcikas will resign before his case is discussed in 
parliament. 
  The minister earlier said he does not intend to give up his 
post and suspected attempts to defame him.

<F P=106> [Seventh article in a series by Virginijus Gaivenis: "Who </F>
Armed National Defense? (7)"] 
  [Excerpts] Russian law enforcement officials are 
interested in the contracts signed between the Lithuanian 
National Defense Ministry [KAM] and the Baltic Fleet leadership. 
It is becoming increasingly obvious that the actual sum paid by 
the KAM to the Kaunas association "Selma" for 5,000 machine guns 
is three times smaller than that taken from the bank and handed 
over to "Selma's" three-time convicted president V. 
Laurinavicius. To the safes of which officials, the military, 
or Mafia groups did more than 100 million rubles [R] go? 
  Last year, the shortage of thousands of field glasses, guns, 
and other arms was established at Baltic Fleet storehouses in 
Kaliningrad Oblast. Stolen arms were shipped to Russia and sold 
to anyone who wanted them. This uncontrolled process had 
continued over all of last year until finally one day law 
enforcement officials detained five military and civilian 
Russian residents in a successful operation. The detained 
persons were asked why and for whom they were stealing arms. 
However, the men became hoarse from trying to find excuses for 
stealing between 50 and 100 machine guns each, while the Baltic 
Fleet leadership was illegally selling thousands of such arms to 
Lithuanian Mafia structures. Millions [currency unspecified] 
were allegedly flowing to the pockets of military leaders of 
both countries. The strangest thing was, however, that no one 
noticed or did not want to notice this. This situation was 
immediately reported to the management of the service for 
investigating organized crime at the St. Petersburg Interior 
Administration, which became quite concerned with investigating 
this story. At that time, officials dealing with this case 
received news from Lithuania that the newspaper RESPUBLIKA had 
begun to publish a scandalous story about the arming of KAM, 
arms prices, and relations between the military and organized 
criminal groups, which attracted their attention. 
Representatives of the St. Petersburg militia officially 
appealed to the Lithuanian Prosecutor General's Office for 
assistance, requesting that the latter interrogate V. 
Laurinavicius and former KAM leaders. Our officials agreed to 
help. A group of Russian law enforcement officials already has 
plans to come to Lithuania next week. 
  As we wrote earlier, the government resolution issued on 19 
August 1992 authorized [former] National Defense Minister A. 
Butkevicius to conclude an agreement with the Kaunas association 
"Selma" on the supply of light firearms for the KAM. The 
ministry planned to acquire 5,000 AKM-74 machine guns for 
R198,770,000. [passage omitted] For some reason, A. Butkevicius 
pledged to pay the total sum to V. Laurinavicius in cash, even 
though the Lithuanian law forbids this. As a RESPUBLIKA 
reporter managed to find out, between 20 August and 7 September 
1992, KAM officials withdrew R198,770,000 from an account in the 
Vilnius branch of the Lithuanian Bank and shortly thereafter 
handed over the entire sum to "Selma's" three-time convicted 
president V. Laurinavicius. V. Drupas, chief of the KAM Arms 
Department, received the arms from "Selma" on 15 August 1992. 
True, these were not the same arms as indicated in the 
government resolution: The KAM received AK-74 machine guns 
instead of the AKM-74 model. The arms were supplied without 
ministry authorization. The consignment notes were written the 
same day. However, there was not a single word uttered about 
the price of firearms and the total sum paid. "How much did the 
ministry actually pay for the machine guns?" we questioned in 
RESPUBLIKA's very first publication on the arming of the 
National Defense forces. 
  Officials and employees from the service for investigating 
organized crime at the St. Petersburg Interior Administration 
have already interrogated the Baltic Fleet command and retrieved 
the documents where the actual price of Kalashnikov machine guns 
sold to Lithuania's National Defense forces is written in black 
and white. It is evident that one machine gun was sold for 
R11,000, while the agreement concluded between Minister A. 
Butkevicius and "Selma" President V. Laurinavicius indicated 
that it would cost the ministry $220 ($1 equaling R180.70). It 
is not difficult to establish by performing simple calculations 
that the KAM pledged to pay R39,754 for each machine gun, and it 
delivered this sum to "Selma." The paid price exceeded the 
actual cost by more than 300 percent. Thus, it seems that over 
R100 million disappeared SOMEWHERE. Officials from both the 
service for investigating organized crime at the St. Petersburg 
Interior Administration and the Lithuanian Prosecutor General's 
Office working on this case cannot yet answer who received these 
millions. [passage omitted] "We do not doubt that corrupt 
officials, and not only them, profited considerably from this 
arms deal. To be more exact, they stuffed millions into their 
pockets. Therefore, our duty is to make everything clear with 
the assistance of the Lithuanian Prosecutor General's Office, 
establish the offenders, and name Russian officials who ignore 
the law," said Andrey Safanovskiy, chief of the Eighth 
Department at the St. Petersburg Regional Administration for 
Investigating Organized Crime, in a telephone interview with a 
RESPUBLIKA reporter the day before yesterday. 
  Gennadiy Tselovalnikov, investigator for particularly 
important cases from St. Petersburg, who has been charged with 
supervising this case, told a reporter that the heads of several 
officials might roll due to the disorder in the Baltic Fleet. 
True, Russian law enforcement officials are interested not only 
in the agreement on arms sales, but also in those on the 
purchase of ships and helicopters. According to G. 
Tselovalnikov, the investigation may be slow, because they must 
interrogate many people linked with this story. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by LDDP Deputy Chairman Gediminas Kirkilas: </F>
"Provincialism or the Fear of Competition?"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The level of political 
culture largely depends on the ability of parties' to compete 
among themselves. I suppose that the public's opinion on 
democracy, parliamentarism, and pluralism is also very 
important. It is no secret that opponents of democratic 
development are trying to persuade society to accept the ideas 
of "a firm hand," "order," and so on, by pointing to 
parliamentary discussions and uncultured attacks of one party 
against another. For obvious reasons, it is not difficult to do 
this in our current situation. 
  The current opponents, who previously held power, are 
particularly angry and impertinent. One can understand them: 
Their greatest desire is to return to power as soon as 
possible, and the current majority, that is, the Lithuanian 
Democratic Labor Party [LDDP], is their "number-one enemy".... 
  It is more difficult to understand the relations, 
particularly recent ones, between the LDDP and the Lithuanian 
Social Democratic Party [LSDP]. Our supporters are calling and 
asking us what happened to make the two parties so hostile 
toward one another recently. 
  Certainly, given the latest LSDP press conferences and its 
leader A. Sakalas' special trip to the Socialist International 
with the aim of lodging complaints against the LDDP and 
preventing its admission to this organization, such questions 
are only natural. We say nothing about the Social Democrats' 
pitifully ridiculous interpellation to the government and their 
weekly LIETUVOS ZINIOS [News of Lithuania] permeated with LDDP 
criticism, which, incidentally, has not published an LDDP 
opinion even once, while TIESA has done this quite often. 
  I will begin from LDDP's attitude toward the Social 
Democrats. Our attitude toward the LSDP and its activities has 
been positive since the very beginning. We remember how both 
factions often voted together or held similar positions in the 
former Supreme Council, particularly when we had to defend 
democracy and common sense. Both parties expressed the same 
views on and contributed most to the May 1992 referendum by 
speaking out against greater powers for the former parliament 
leader [Landsbergis], as well as the same opinion on the 
constitutional process. 
  As we remember, the 1992 elections to the Seimas 
[parliament] 
were not very successful for the LSDP. Shortly thereafter, the 
LSDP leadership refused to cooperate with the LDDP government or 
form a coalition. The Social Democrats, liberals, and centrists 
must have feared the rightists' accusations of "collaboration" 
with the LDDP government.... Despite such a position, the LDDP 
faction voted for LSDP leader A. Sakalas when electing the 
Seimas deputy chairman, and later appointed him head of the 
Lithuanian delegation to the European Council Parliamentary 
Assembly. 
  This does not mean that the LDDP is demanding some unusual 
loyalty from the Social Democrats. I think, however, that we 
could expect normal relations. One cannot say that the Social 
Democratic opposition is as destructive as that of the 
right-wing parties which, in general, are continuing the 
election campaign and organizing strikes, rallies, pickets, and 
so on. The Social Democrats, and, maybe, the liberals and 
centrists, are trying to uphold a more civilized spirit of 
political discussion. This is very important, because the 
destructive policy of the right-wing opposition could make 
Lithuania's political life absurd and completely discredit 
parliamentarism and the shoots of democracy. 
  However, one cannot help noticing the LSDP nervous reaction 
to LDDP attempts to become a member of the Socialist 
International. What is this: Provincialism, the fear of 
competition, or the inferiority complex of a smaller party? In 
my opinion, we should not compete for membership in this 
prestigious international organization. One of the key 
principles of the Socialist International is the solidarity of 
leftist forces. [passage omitted] 
  In some post-communist countries of Europe, for example, in 
Poland and Slovakia, social democratic and leftist parties 
overcame this syndrome of provincialism long ago, and they can 
cooperate and form coalitions. 
  The LDDP and LSDP membership in, as well as prestige and 
influence on international organizations will depend on their 
actual political weight in the legislature rather than on 
international party intrigues and the extrapolation of our 
provincial relations to Europe. Currently, the LDDP is 
cooperating, exchanging delegations and experience, and 
consulting with social democratic and leftist parties in France, 
Britain, Poland, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Hungary, and 
Germany, as well as in Scandinavia and the Baltic states. We 
participate in the work of the European Forum for Democracy and 
Solidarity (one of the divisions in the Socialist 
International), women's and youth organizations, and 
foundations. Our membership in one or another organization will 
depend on the majority's opinion rather than on that of 
individual leaders. 
  Certainly, while talking with leaders of some European 
party, 
it is not pleasant to learn that our colleagues from another 
Lithuanian party have already tried to impart an unfavorable 
opinion of the LDDP. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Here is some information we have received from 
Ukraine's Ministry of Defense. It is a statement with the 
following content: 
  Recently Russia's mass media, in particular Interfax and the 
SEGODNYA newspaper, have been circulating information about the 
dispatch from Ukraine's territory of special trains carrying 
nuclear warheads which are to be handed over to the Russian side 
in accordance with Ukraine's international obligations. At the 
same time, with reference to informed sources in the Russian 
Federation's Ministry of Defense, data of a strictly 
confidential nature is being broadcast. 
  The ease with which some journalists, referring to the 
Russian military, disseminate information throughout the world 
on the times, dates, and destinations of the trains carrying 
nuclear warheads evokes surprise, especially as Russian 
specialists cannot but acknowledge the fact that such actions 
create a real threat to the safety of the transportation of 
nuclear warheads. 
  Ukraine's Ministry of Defense Press Service states that such 
actions are provocative and inadmissible because they are 
directed at creating a new spiral of tension around Ukraine's 
nuclear disarmament. Because of the lack of discipline among 
Russian information sources, Ukraine is now forced to make 
additional adjustments to the schedule and routes for the 
transportation of nuclear warheads.

structures (let us recall, for example, a joint statement signed 
by the leaders of the Socialist, Communist, and Peasant Parties) 
have aimed their propaganda apparatus at General Skipalskyy. 
  [Skipalskyy] I am grateful to the leaders of the 
above-mentioned parties and, first of all, to Oleksandr Moroz 
[head of the Socialist Party], for evaluating me so highly. 
However, I do not care so much about it. According to current 
statistical data, 76 percent of Ukraine's population does not 
pay any attention to party activities today. I am sure that I 
will not go into any interparty quarrels by evaluating the 
activities of these organizations during the electoral campaign. 
I am running for a deputy's seat from my home constituency as 
an independent candidate. I have not come here to instruct the 
people -- everybody knows how we are living. I have come here 
to show my gratitude to my countrymen. From them I inherited my 
love for the Volyn region and for all of Ukraine. Here in the 
Volyn region, I grew into manhood. I would like to repay this 
debt by my dedicated efforts for the strengthening of our state. 
For this purpose I have chosen the Vladimir Volynskiy 
constituency. I know the Luboml region very well; the ancient 
city of Vladimir is one of our spiritual capitals. One really 
feels that the city was a center of the European state a 
thousand years ago. This has been preserved in the genes of our 
contemporary Volyn residents. We should make our Ukraine the 
same strong state. 
  [Verbych] Therefore, we would like to hear about the 
essentials of your election platform. 
  [Skipalskyy] They are extremely simple. The content of my 
election platform can be summed up in three words: 
state--order--prosperity. As of today, we do not live in an 
independent state. We need hard work and, undoubtedly, an 
appropriate political position. On the other hand, we will 
never attain prosperity unless we introduce proper order. 
Raging crime, theft, cynicism in the legal system, anarchy, and 
predatory robbery of the people and state -- all these evils 
must be urgently uprooted. In addition, it must be done 
ruthlessly and with purpose. Prosperity means an indispensable 
transition to market economy with social protection for the 
citizens. Prosperity means the economic independence of every 
individual. 
  [Verbych] Our citizens have already sunk into the sea of 
smooth-tongued words. Streams of words, failing to transform 
themselves into concrete actions, are pouring out of the mouths 
of state officials and would-be people's deputies. However, it 
seems that the people believe neither the former nor the latter. 
Quite frequently one can hear opinions that deliverance lies in 
rule by a "firm hand." 
  [Skipalskyy] It is my opinion, too. Our people have every 
reason to speak like that. A state is impossible without order 
in society. True, the notion of rule by a "firm hand" has been 
deformed due to the cult of personality, everyday wrongdoings, 
and bloody class slaughter. The notion of "firm-hand" rule 
means an appropriate order and strong authority. Without these, 
we will not be able to build a democratic society. Nothing 
happens just on its own. One cannot just wake up in the morning 
and find oneself in an independent state; one cannot become a 
different man just like that. Why, after two years of honest and 
persevering labor of many hard- working men, do we see that the 
people are living in extremely difficult conditions, worse than 
they have even been? Because our citizens are working for the 
benefit of the state. which is being robbed more and more often. 
But the state, I will repeat myself, does not actually exist. 
We have lost our positions in the Crimea, in the Black Sea 
Fleet. We have been working amorphously, unresolutely; we 
thought that history would put everything in its proper place. 
But history will only record all our inactivity. While fully 
understanding our needs, we have not been able to speak of what 
we must do. But just try to do it if there is no division among 
the three branches of power -- executive, legislative, and 
judicial. Not to mention the fourth power -- the media -- more 
precisely, the press which is filled with reproaches, tug-of-war 
games, and accusations... 
  [Verbych] And very often the press is in search of 
sensational stories, complying, so to say, to the demands of 
certain forces... 
  [Skipalskyy] We are still pursued by the inertia of class 
struggle. We must be directed by the policy of state building. 
Those who contribute to this goal should not be defamed all the 
time, discredited, and raised against others... 
  [Verbych] We have to state today that among the electorate 
there is apathy, disillusion, and disappointment. One can often 
hear that the elections may not be held. That is to say, some 
of our citizens actually refuse to influence the path our state 
will take toward development. We forget that we are also to 
blame for today's difficult situation, because we are the ones 
who chose the people's deputies and the president. People say 
in despair: It makes no difference to us. 
  [Skipalskyy] I do not believe that it makes no difference 
to them. Their hearts are bleeding and flaming. Regarding 
disillusion, it was also inherited from another historical 
epoch. However, I would not like to attribute it to the 
Ukrainian mentality. I am sure that the elections will be held. 
There is no other way for us than free elections. True, given 
the large number of candidates, people must select those who 
will really care about the state and the nation. This is the 
first version. The second one, extremely undesirable, is a 
rigorous army dictatorship. There is also a third one -- enter 
Ivan from the north and says: "Well, Little Russians [term used 
by Russians to denote Ukrainians], residents of southern Russia, 
if you are incapable of building the state, we will help you." 
[passage in quotation marks in Russian] I am afraid of a 
recurrence of history. There may be one more version: In 
order to please Europe, Russia proposes to tear Ukraine to 
pieces. A shadow of danger is constantly hovering over us. As 
you know, certain politicians in Poland adopt statements making 
territorial demands. Similar forces exist in Romania and 
Hungary. I do not exclude the possibility that Ukraine may be 
partitioned along the Sluch or Dnepr rivers. This is no joking 
matter. One must assess today's real situation. We have to 
think and act if we are to take care of our descendants. 
  [Verbych] The world treats us in a peculiar way. Let us 
recall: The United States recognized the former Soviet Union 
just when communists provoked in Ukraine a famine that has no 
record in 20th century civilization. We also see the trends 
that dominate in Poland: For the first time since 1945, they 
put an officer from Eastern Europe on trial, and this is 
Ukrainian Major Lysenko. In addition, according to many 
political experts, the domestic situation in our state, in the 
wake of Meshkov's election to the Crimean presidency, will 
aggravate matters extremely: The trends toward autonomy will be 
made a major issue by certain political forces. Ukraine may 
face the prospect of being partitioned and divided by other 
states. Do you think that Ukraine can avoid a situation as that 
in Yugoslavia? 
  [Skipalskyy] There will be no such case as in Yugoslavia in 
Ukraine; the situation is quite different. The issue of 
federalization is a quite different topic. This issue is urgent 
for Russia which still remains an empire. With regard to the 
Crimea, this is a result of our miscalculations. As far back as 
1991, I said: The Crimea has been bridled in order to 
continually tug the Ukrainian horse by the head. The "elder 
brother" will never accept Ukraine's significant advancement in 
economic development. However, we must be soberminded 
politicians: Russia is our neighbor, and we must cooperate in 
order to keep interstate relations friendly. From a 
geopolitical viewpoint, Russia is interested in Ukraine being a 
friendly state. Russia has enough problems in its relations 
with the Muslim world, as well as in domestic matters. 
  [Verbych] Your opponents long ago declared "war" on you. 
They ardently persuade: We are the very people whom the 
Ukrainian parliament needs. Oleksandr Oleksandrovych, in your 
opinion, what people should be elected to the Supreme Council? 
  [Skipalskyy] Undoubtedly, those people who actively 
contribute to the building of Ukraine, who carry the burden of 
provocative accusations, compromises. This is being done by 
ideological opponents and special services of those states that 
are not interested in Ukraine gaining strength. Our 
competitors, I will repeat myself, are capable of estimating 
worthy opponents. Let us recall that wise Ukrainian proverb: 
Lightning never strikes in the rotten oats. Regarding those 
calumnies against me, I never yield to a dog's barking. As for 
my opponents, I would suggest that they hold more fair 
arguments. I want to become a worthy representative of the 
Vladimir Volynskiy and Lukoml rayons in the Supreme Council to 
protect the interests of Volyn residents in such a way as not to 
make them ashamed of my speeches and actions. Working in the 
legislative body, I will try to support bills intended to 
protect citizens. 
  [Verbych] Oleksandr Oleksandrovych, you never were a 
stranger here in the Volyn region. I recall the time when there 
was a conflict ripening in Volodimir Volynskiy -- the Interfront 
was just about to be launched -- and you were the man who 
prevented a very dangerous clash. 
  [Skipalskyy] What is more, our former opponents constituted 
90 percent of the electors who put me forward as a candidate. 
My concept is to consolidate. We have to unite ourselves to 
build the Ukrainian statehood regardless of nationality and 
party alignment. Our citizens should not be forced into a class 
struggle, as was done by Marxist-Leninist apologists. Only one 
category of citizens must be isolated in our society -- 
criminals. Our recovery lies in the policy of statehood 
building, in statehood philosophy.

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel Mykola Bilovil, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA </F>
military columnist: "We Will Never Give Away Our Lard or Our 
Missiles! Once Again About Ukrainian Nuclear Weapons"] 
  [Text] Ever since the question of eliminating Ukrainian 
strategic weapons arose, a song that I heard sung on the beach 
by a little girl has been haunting me: "The old woman took care 
of her old man as long as he had lard." 
  Nuclear weapons constitute our lard. 
  These are 46 SS-24 launchers, 130 SS-19 units, and about 40 
heavy bombers TU-160 and TU-95 MS, for which 670 cruise missiles 
equipped with nuclear warheads are stored. 
  The availability of such quantities of powerful weapons has, 
in fact, placed Ukraine at the center of worldwide attention, to 
the extent that even the U.S. President overcame his reluctance 
and made a visit to Boryspil airport -- our capital's air gate 
-- to meet with President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  Some people triumphed on this occasion -- a victory of our 
diplomacy -- major foreign leaders are coming to us cap in hand. 
However, we should not be so naive! They will come to us and 
will try to please us as long as our "old man" president has 
that same "lard" that everybody wants. Since, as long as we 
have it, someone's [Russia's] hands are securely bound. 
  Isn't this clear? Who would care about us today and who 
would remember us in this time of economic troubles, if, by 
virtue of fate, we had not become heirs to those same strategic 
forces, which, over the long years of the "Cold War," helped 
maintain peace and quiet? 
  It is of interest to recall the evolution in U.S.-Ukrainian 
relations from the very beginning of the process of nuclear 
missile disarmament. At first, the frenzied pressure upon us: 
Give away all of your missiles or things will be bad for you! 
We gave away tactical weapons.... The world silently accepted 
our gift to Russia, but for us this only meant losses. 
  The pressure built up. At long last, we came to our senses 
and put forward conditions: security guarantees, financial 
assistance, and compensations. At first, nobody would even 
listen to us. Just behold that enfeebled Ukraine putting 
forward conditions! Even the first U.S. Ambassador in Ukraine 
Roman Popadyuk started threatening us: You are inviting fire. 
  We were not scared. We had enough common sense to uphold our 
position. 
  This time, the Tripartite Statement was signed in Moscow. 
However, here, too, we only got great promises in words and 
nothing specific in practice. 
  UKRAYINSKA HAZETA has written about all of these sudden 
changes around our lard, which is presently referred to as 
"Ukrainian snickers," since its first issue. It also stated 
that nuclear weapons have too much influence upon the world 
climate and that it should not be treated too lightly. 
  Even though we had been led to that same borderline where, 
it 
might seem, one could already echo Hemingway's "Farewell to 
Arms!" our parliament had enough brains not to make the last 
step leading to the abyss: The deputies voted against Ukraine's 
joining the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  Oh, how much excitement this caused in the Russian press, 
radio, and television! There was more mayhem about this in 
Russia than in the United States. 
  Why did Russia raise that outcry? Is it interested in our 
disarmament more than the United States is? 
  It appears so. How can it be otherwise? Belarus handed over 
its missiles and so did Kazakhstan. Stubborn Ukraine alone 
prevents Russia from becoming the only nuclear-missile queen on 
the territory of the former Warsaw Pact. There is enough in it 
to cause one to go out of his mind! 
  One important circumstance rendered the Russians 
particularly 
anxious: In 1995, the validity of the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty expires. The future of this document will depend upon 
the decisions of an international conference. Unless Ukraine 
joins the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty now, this question may 
become irrelevant in its own right. 
  Russian papers write that, in such a case, the "domino 
theory" will work and quite a number of states will remain 
nuclear. 
  For my part, I want to ask: Why are you so concerned about 
the future? Don't you see that today, Israel, China, and North 
Korea are becoming nuclear powers? Or let faraway countries arm 
themselves, while nearby Ukraine must give away its nuclear 
warheads? 
  Incidentally, a few words about the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. It was approved by the UN General Assembly in 1968. 
Today, 158 states are signatories. The main objective of the 
treaty is to restrict the proliferation of nuclear weapons and 
to ensure international control over the fulfillment by the 
states of their obligations. For those who are signatories to 
the treaty and have nuclear weapons, these obligations mean that 
nuclear weapons or nuclear detonators should not be passed on to 
any other country, and nonnuclear states should not be 
encouraged to acquire nuclear arsenals. Those, who do not have 
such weapons, undertake not to receive them from others and not 
to manufacture them at home. 
  As one can see, there is not a single word on the relations 
of nuclear states among themselves. It follows from this that 
they may pass these deadly weapons to one another. 
  However, there is not a single allusion at the situation, 
which has taken shape in our country after the disintegration of 
the USSR. Ukraine was not a nuclear state, and strategic forces 
of the Union were deployed on its territory. Ukraine never was 
a participant in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, because 
there was no need for it to be one. It appears that it made a 
bad error by signing the Lisbon Protocol, having thereby driven 
itself into a kind of trap. Had there been good will on the part 
of the world community, Ukraine's signature would have simply be 
canceled as legally invalid. 
  However, nobody cares now and everybody keeps demanding: 
Ukraine, get yourself into the noose that you have prepared for 
yourself. They are demanding, because they know that the 
unfortunate year 1995 will come, the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty will become ineffective, and Ukraine will have to declare 
itself a nuclear power and join the nuclear club. 
  It is true that our parliament ratified Article 5 of the 
Lisbon Protocol recommending Ukraine to join the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty as soon as possible. However, a 
question arises: On what terms? As a nuclear power or as a 
nonnuclear state? 
  Academician I. Yukhnovskyy stresses in UKRAYINSKA HAZETA 
that 
we are owners, but not masters of strategic complexes. This 
situation is also not provided for in the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. Why then should we join it and in what 
capacity? 
  In my opinion, we must state our position once and for all. 
Here, all international bodies should have helped us, if they 
had sincere and open intentions. We can see that all they do is 
making fabrications and trying hard to swindle us and bring us 
to our knees, so that they could then deal with a secondary and 
obedient state. What will then remain from our independence, 
which we have gained through such a painful process. Just 
recollections? 
  I do not believe that there is no way out from this 
extremely 
complicated situation, a way out that will be acceptable for 
everybody. 
  Is the Ukrainian state with such a great scientific and 
technological potential unable to deal with its own missiles? 
If there are too many of them, we must only leave the quantity 
we need and ensure their proper servicing, without aiming them 
at anyone. Let them remain on stand-by. The rest of the 
missiles must be dismantled, the fuel must be used for peaceful 
purposes, and the silos and frames of the launchers for economic 
needs. I fully agree with Ihor Rafayilovych [Yukhnovskyy]. 
  All of this must be done by our own efforts. We are capable 
of doing this. Our scientists have already found a way to 
neutralize the extremely harmful component of nuclear fuel -- 
heptyl. At the same time, Americans proposed their assistance 
in processing the highly enriched uranium into low-grade uranium. 
  What else do we need? Money, perhaps? Right, and let Bill 
Clinton fulfill his promises. 
  It is hard to understand why we remain poor when we have 
such 
wealth. Other states put in much effort to extract uranium, and 
they sell it. We have nuclear fuel as the stuffing of warheads. 
Is it really more difficult to extract it from there than from 
mines? 
  I also have a question for new U.S. ambassador in Ukraine, 
Mr. W. Miller. If his country is really capable of providing us 
with considerable monetary assistance (on credit, of course), 
why doesn't it do it now instead of simply declaring its 
intentions? 
  Give us the necessary capital and we, jointly with U.S. 
entrepreneurs, will very quickly organize the processing of 
highly enriched uranium into low-grade uranium, will repay you 
with it, will provide our atomic plants with fuel, and will also 
sell it to Russia or exchange it for something there. This is a 
perfectly realistic project from which everybody will benefit. 
However, no way, Washington does not accept such a variant. It 
only has one demand: Give away your missiles, Ukraine. Then we 
will wipe our feet on you. Isn't it so, Mr. Miller? Please 
explain this to our readers and to our people. Explain honestly 
and openly. 
  Nuclear fuel is now in very short supply. In Russia -- at 
the Smolensk, Leningrad, and Kursk atomic electric power plants 
[AES] -- fuel reserves are coming to an end. At the Chernobyl 
AES, one power unit has already been halted. An energy collapse 
has set in. Or, perhaps, we are being deliberately pushed into 
such a situation in order that we would later buy that same 
uranium, at any price, from the United States? 
  Answer this question, too, Mr. Miller. 
  Our president intends to ask between $600 million and $800 
million from the United States. This capital might help us 
emerge from the crisis. However, there is little hope that this 
money will be obtained. Who needs a strong and powerful Ukraine? 
  As for those missiles that still remain in their combat 
positions, they could serve as a counterbalance until Ukraine 
joins the nuclear club and becomes, on that basis, a participant 
in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Following that and 
together with all other nuclear powers Ukraine will start 
disarming. 
  Between 3 and 8 March, L.M. Kravchuk will meet with Bill 
Clinton in the United States. Bill Clinton's letter, announced 
by our president at the Supreme Council session, led our 
parliamentarians to vote for removing reservations from the 
Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol. In that letter, the U.S. 
President promised to double all types of assistance to us and 
even to take care of our missile officers. The latter is very 
important. Because, today, our commander of a rocket division 
gets 2.2 million coupons and a lieutenant in the Russian Army -- 
190,000 rubles [figures as published]. 
  However, will everything be the way we would like it to be? 
  Doubts, doubts.... That is why we would very much like our 
president to adopt the right line of conduct, so that all of us 
would not have to sing "the old woman took care of her old man 
as long as he had lard...."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 10 TASS -- Some 70 billion roubles have 
been sent to representative authorities of the regions for 
holding an electoral campaign, chairman of the Central Electoral 
Commission of Russia said today during a hotline telephone 
conference with heads of local government of subjects of the 
federation and of the Regional Electoral Commission. The topic 
of the telephone conference was their readiness for elections of 
regional authorities and local government bodies. 
  Ryabov pointed out that the sum was not sufficient, and that 
additional sums will be allocated after a federal budget for 
1994 is adopted. On the whole, he continued, the Central 
Electoral Commission is not financing now elections in the 
republics. However, a draft document is expected to be signed by 
the president on the additional financing of the electoral 
campaign in some republics at their request. This refers 
primarily to Ingushetia. 
  Ryabov urged the authorities in the subjects of the 
federation to pay special attention to ensuring the legality of 
the electoral campaign. The first experience of holding 
elections in some regions was "not quite positive", as he put 
it. It depends on the local authorities, in the first place, to 
make the elections free and democratic. He said that the 
elections had not taken place in some subjects of the federation 
because of a low activity of electors. In some areas only 25 per 
cent of them came to the polling stations. 
  The right to take part in elections in accordance with party 
lists has not been put into effect in any of the regions. This, 
in the opinion of Ryabov, "is not promoting the consolidation of 
a multi-party system." He said that representatives of the 
Central Electoral Commission had visited a number of subjects of 
the federation in order to help organise the electoral campaign, 
and were going to visit more. According to Ryabov, some 
deviations from the legislation were observed, including those 
connected with the wrong division into constituencies. 
  He believes it is necessary to enhance the role of the 
executive authorities in organising the electoral campaign. 
They should explain that the new representative authorities, 
formed in accordance with the new Constitution, would be able to 
resolve many problems of everyday life of the population. In 
his opinion, "the level of activity of the population at the 
elections corresponds directly to the level of prestige of the 
authorities." 
  Speaking about electons to the local government bodies, 
Ryabov said that numerous proposals were coming to the Central 
Electoral Commission on postponing the elections till autumn. 
The commission believes that it would be reasonable. However, 
it would hardly be worthwhile to postpone elections in the 
areas, where there are only several days left before the 
elections and where both the authorities and the population are 
getting prepared for them in a normal way.

  [Text] Tension persists in some sectors of the battle front 
in Karabakh. The Azerbaijani side is not abandoning its 
attempts to break through the Karabakh's defensive line at the 
southeastern sector of the conflict zone. 
  The enemy tried to launch an infantry attack against the 
Karabakh positions east of Martuninskiy Rayon on the evening of 
9 March. Having countered a retaliation and suffered losses, the 
Azerbaijanis retreated to their initial positions. This was 
reported by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army Press 
Service. 
  The same source also reported that intensive shelling of the 
Karabakh positions in Martuninskiy and Fizulinskiy rayons 
resumed this morning. The Armenian side resorted to counter 
operations. There are also reports of Azerbaijani military 
losses in these sectors of the front.

<F P=106> [Rustam Narzikulov report under the "Protocol" rubric: </F>
"Ukraine Agrees To Pay Debts to Gazprom. It Can Only Pay in 
Property"] 
  [Text] Yesterday's talks in Moscow on clearing the debts 
for deliveries of Russian gas to Ukraine to the tune of 1.5 
trillion rubles ended in the signing of a protocol defining the 
ways of debt settlement. 
  Ukraine is supposed to pay nearly half of the entire debt in 
money; in payment for the remaining part, Gazprom will receive a 
share in the authorized stocks of the gas transportation 
infrastructure enterprises (51 percent) and in a number of 
factories in which Gazprom is interested (51 percent). The 
facilities in question are in particular the export gas pipeline 
to Europe, subterranean storage tanks on the territory of 
Ukraine, and the Odessa port factory. The Ukrainian side made 
some concessions, agreeing to hand over property to clear off 
the already amassed debts rather than pay for future deliveries 
of gas, something with which Gazprom categorically disagreed. 
  The question of transfer of property to Gazprom is supposed 
to be considered by the Ukrainian side within a week. No 
deadlines on the payment of monetary debts was set, although the 
process of payment of the monetary debt is likely to be one of 
the main subjects of another meeting between the sides on 10 
April to discuss the progress of implementation of the March 
protocol provisions. 
  Ukraine has no money, and its only real asset is property 
accumulated in the past years. Gazprom can therefore only hope 
for the material source of debt settlement which, however, can 
be cut off at any moment under pressure from nationalist forces. 
  A high-ranking Gazprom official said that deliveries of gas 
to Ukraine resumed in the previous amounts right at the 
completion of yesterday's negotiations.

<F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Kononenko: "President Promotes Idea of </F>
Signing Document on Civil Peace"] 
  [Text] On the morning of 10 March, people representing the 
most diverse institutions of society -- from political parties 
to power structures -- gathered in B. Yeltsin's office in the 
Kremlin. Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin was there, as were 
Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Aleksiy II; M. Miytukov and 
V. Viktorov, deputy chairmen of the two chambers of parliament; 
Ye. Gaydar, leader of "Russia's Choice"; V. Zorkaltsev, 
representative of "Communists of Russia"; N. Vitruk, chief of 
the Constitutional Court; and representatives of trade unions 
and public organizations. The president assembled this audience 
in order to seek the entire spectrum of views on a very 
important idea he has been plugging of late -- the idea of civil 
peace and accord. 
  "We are getting information from all over Russia," the 
president said, "that people support the proposal I put in my 
message to parliament on the signing of a document on civil 
peace and accord. Everyone must see that the time for 
confrontation is past. I am proposing an organized discussion 
today of the question of preparing such a document, on the basis 
of which it would be possible to unite all political forces in 
society for the sake of the main goal -- peace and tranquillity 
in Russia. In fact, irrespective of our different views, we are 
all patriots. This should not be a battlefield. If there are 
differences on other questions they must be resolved through 
negotiations. A short document of five pages or so could be 
prepared within two weeks, and then we could meet again to find 
the mechanism whereby as many participants as possible would 
sign it." 
  If the main political forces were to sign the document 
(memorandum or charter?) on civil peace and accord, all 
potential instigators of social tensions would find their hands 
tied, since people would be unlikely to oppose the idea of 
social accord publicly. Whether it is possible or not is 
another matter. It is hard to imagine a binding rather than 
merely cosmetic document suiting parties of different 
ideological hues. While making pledges, they would inevitably 
start making demands as a condition of signing the document -- 
from the creation of a coalition government to the 
reestablishment of the USSR. Such is the spread of views at the 
moment.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Kobaladze, head of Foreign </F>
Intelligence Service press bureau, by unidentified 
correspondent; place and date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Today we are starting a new series 
of programs about the Foreign Intelligence Service. Radio 
Slavyanka's questions are answered by Yuriy Kobaladze, head of 
the service's press bureau. Russia's Foreign Intelligence 
Service has only existed as an independent organization since 
the end of 1991, when it was hived off from the KGB. Has this 
separation proved justified? 
  [Kobaladze] I am convinced that it was justified. Several 
factors show that this move was the correct one. First, an 
intelligence service can never be a law enforcement agency. Its 
existence within the KGB, as it was then, meant that the 
intelligence service was expected to perform law enforcement 
functions. An intelligence service should not carry out such 
work. An intelligence service is a completely separate and 
independent organization, which performs a special, unique form 
of work. 
  [Correspondent] But clearly, there must be some kind of 
legislative framework regulating the activities of Russia's 
Foreign Intelligence Service, stipulating the bounds beyond 
which its officers must not stray in their work. 
  [Kobaladze] Yes, we are very proud of the fact that a law on 
foreign intelligence was adopted last year for the first time in 
Russia's history. This document was very carefully drafted. A 
great deal of preparatory work was done, and our experts were 
brought in to help. Everything that exists elsewhere in the 
world in this sphere was analyzed. It transpired that, 
basically, there is only one country, the United States, that 
has developed legislation in this sphere, a clearcut law that 
regulates the activities of the intelligence service. After 
taking all this experience, all this international, world 
experience, and modifying it, parliament adopted the law. We 
believe it is a very good law. 
  [Correspondent] The Russian Federation's law on foreign 
intelligence clearly defines the powers and responsibilities of 
intelligence officers and stipulates the need for parliamentary 
control over their activities. What else does Yuriy Kobaladze 
regard as being fundamentally new in this document? 
  [Kobaladze] I also wish to emphasize the fact that party 
influence in the intelligence service has been completely 
removed, and this requirement is now enshrined in law. In other 
words, an intelligence officer cannot be a member of any party, 
cannot get involved in party activities. Furthermore, the 
service has been de-ideologized. In other words, we in the 
intelligence service do not serve the interests of any party 
grouping or ideology, as it were. We have only one ideology: 
defense of the country's national interests, serving the 
fatherland, serving the lawfully elected authorities, and 
serving the constitution. We do not have any other ideology.

  [Text] Tbilisi, March 10 (AFP) -- Explosions rocked central 
Tbilisi Thursday [10 March], killing at least two people and 
wrecking a military headquarters and a tax office, the Interior 
Ministry said. 
  Two other people were hurt and more could be buried under 
the 
ruins of the headquarters of the Mkhedrioni (knights), a former 
militia now part of the regular armed forces, where the 
strongest blast occurred, the ministry said. 
  Three smaller explosions occurred at the main tax department 
in the city. 
  Georgia, which in two years has seen a coup and two civil 
wars, is currently the theatre of a power struggle between the 
Security and Defence Ministries as well as uncontrolled banditry. 
  The Mkhedrioni, loyal to the president of the Georgian 
emergency committee, Djaba Iosseliani, had one of their regional 
officers killed at the end of January. 
  On February 3, while Russian President Boris Yeltsin was in 
Tbilisi, Deputy Defence Minister Nikolai Kekelidze was killed by 
a bomb at his home, and Defence Minister Georgi Karkarashvili 
was wounded by a second blast while visiting the scene.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By correspondents </F>
Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, and Vitaliy Trubetskoy] 
  [Text] The head of Russian diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev, 
believes that the incident involving the cancelled meeting 
between President Boris Yeltsin and the former American 
President, Richard Nixon, as the recent "spy scandal connected 
with the Ames case", "must not be projected on political 
relations." The ex-president's aides are to blame for the 
incident, said Kozyrev in answer to Interfax's question after 
his Thursday's meeting with his Italian counterpart, Julio 
Andreatta. 
  According to Kozyrev, "Nixon's first mistake was to neglect 
to address Russia's Foreign Ministry." "This is the usual 
practice, the more so as we have known each other for a long 
time. We would have oriented the ex-president correctly from 
the very beginning, in regard to meetings with the opposition he 
was seeking, too," Kozyrev said. "We, too, have to deal with 
the opposition every day, and know it well. Had Nixon asked me 
for a friendly advice, as a professional in the area of 
international relations, I would have advised him to confer with 
President Yeltsin first, particularly in view of the fact that 
they have known each other for a long time, and find acceptable 
and tactful ways to meet with the opposition leaders only 
afterwards. There were no obstacles for such meetings." 
  He does not blame the American ex-president for what 
happened, Kozyrev stressed. "We blame his aides, who ought to 
have organized his trip with the help of their good friends in 
Russia, who would have oriented Nixon professionally. Now his 
aides have only themselves to blame," the foreign minister said. 
  According to him, "there is no point in politicizing the 
errors of aides who did not manage to organize everything on a 
proper professional level." "The blunders of Nixon's aides must 
not cast a shadow on Russian-American relations," Kozyrev 
pointed out. 
  With reference to his talks with the head of Italian 
diplomacy, Julio Andreatta, Kozyrev said that they had focused 
on the ways to organize the next G-7 summit with Russia's 
participation. It's common knowledge that currently Italy is 
the G-7's chairman. 
  "We focused our attention on how to move toward turning the 
G-7 into G-8 at least in regard to political issues, where to do 
without Russia is impossible," Kozyrev said. 
  According to him, the two sides also discussed the activity 
of the CSCE, since Andreatta is the chairman of that 
organization. They also considered such topics, as developments 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the situation connected with Russian 
troops withdrawal from the Baltic countries, and the observance 
of Russian-speakers' rights there. 
  Former U.S. President Richard Nixon has no intention of 
curtailing his visit to Russia and will remain in Moscow until 
March 16, officials close to Nixon, who is on a private visit in 
the Russian capital, told Interfax. 
  On Wednesday [9 March] President Yeltsin said neither he nor 
any of the Russian leaders would see Nixon following his 
meetings with opposition leaders -- Communist Party leader 
Gennadiy Zyuganov and former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy. 
  "We will not seek meetings with Russian officials," one of 
Nixon's aides told Interfax. He said Nixon would attend a 
formal reception at the U.S. Embassy late on Thursday and speak 
to embassy officials at 1200 on Friday. He will later meet with 
Russian deputies including Irina Khakamada. 
  Asked if Nixon was planning to meet LDP [Liberal Democratic 
Party] leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, one of his aides said "no 
agreement has been reached, though Zhirinovskiy's 
representatives were in contact with the American side." 
  The aide said that although Nixon arrived in Moscow in a 
private capacity, this did not prevent him from maintaining 
contacts with the U.S. Embassy here. 
  A meeting between a representative of another state and the 
opposition leader in a democratic country "must not be viewed as 
a provocative act," the leader of the Democratic Party faction 
in the State Duma, Nikolay Travkin, told Interfax in comments on 
President Yeltsin's refusal to meet with the former U.S. 
president, Richard Nixon. 
  As Travkin said, the fact that "somebody came and conferred 
with the opposition must not irritate the head of state who 
claims the role of democrat and builder of democracy."

  [Text] Riga, Mar 09, BNS -- The Latvian Saeima 
(parliament) Defense and Interior Affairs Committee set up a 
working party Wednesday [9 March] to investigate into the record 
of the country's Interior Ministry. 
  The group is authorized to check the methods of staffing 
because police often lack proper knowledge of the Latvian 
language. The lawfullness of non-service engagements of police 
with public structures and funds will be another field for 
inspection. 
  Deputies will also examine whether the ministry uses budget 
resources reasonably and purposefully. 
  The committee formed the group because it wants to help tidy 
up the ministry's structures, committee head Ivars Silars told 
BNS. 
  The parliament must follow the observance of law in police 
units which employ many "chance people whose sense of stately 
responsibility is minimal," said Silars. 
  Interior Minister Girts Kristovskis also welcomed the move, 
Silars noted. The group includes all members of the Defense and 
Interior Affairs' Committee but Kristovskis, Defense Minister 
Valdis Pavlovskis and Defense Ministry's Parliamentary Secretary 
Andris Ligotnis.

  [Text] A statement by the Russian Embassy in Lithuania was 
received by ELTA which reads: 
  As reported by ELTA on 22 February of the current year, 
Nikolay Obertyshev, ambassador of the Russian Federation to the 
Republic of Lithuania, was summoned to the Lithuanian Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs. His attention was drawn to the unsanctioned 
-- in quotation marks -- passage of a Russian train carrying 
armored transport vehicles through the territory of the Republic 
of Lithuania on the night from 19 to 20 February. It was 
requested that Russia should take measures in order that such 
incidents are avoided in future. 
  On the basis of the explanations received from Moscow, the 
Embassy would like to report through ELTA to the Lithuanian 
public that the armament was being transported according to the 
procedure which was coordinated in 1992 by the Russian Defemse 
Ministry and the Lithuanian National Defense Ministry, which 
does not want to register officially a separate agreement or a 
protocol. 
  Lithuania has not until now been informing the Russian 
representatives either about the procedure of informing the 
competent representatives of the Lithuanian authorities six 
hours before the arrival of trains to the border stations when 
this concerns military transit through the territory of 
Lithuania, or about the conditions of the armed guards 
accompanying transit military cargos through the territory of 
Lithuania. 
  There is no doubt that situations such as this could be 
avoided in future if the negotiations started as soon as 
possible and the relevant agreements were prepared on military 
transit which would regulate in full the rights and obligations 
of both countries.

  [Text] Simferopol -- On 10 March, Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov signed a decree on conducting a poll of citizens of the 
Republic of Crimea on 27 March, at the same time as elections to 
the Supreme Councils of Ukraine and Crimea. The document says: 
with reference to the constitutionally consolidated principle of 
the sovereignty of the people, in accordance with which the 
bearer of sovereignty and the only source of state power are the 
people, which are made up of citizens of the Republic of Crimea, 
and with the aim of taking account more fully of the will of 
Crimean citizens when resolving important state issues directly 
affecting the interests of citizens, in accordance with articles 
2, 34, 129, and [number indistinct] of the Constitution of 
Crimea, I resolve: 
  1. To conduct a poll of citizens of the Republic of Crimea 
on 27 March. 
  2. To present the following questions to citizens of the 
republic of Crimea in a poll: 
  A. You are in favor of renewing the clause in the 
Constitution of the Republic of Crimea of 6 May 1992, which 
determined the regulation of mutual relations between the 
Republic of Crimea and Ukraine on the basis of a treaty and an 
agreement? (Yes or No). 
  B. You are in favor of renewing the clause in the 
Constitution of the Republic of Crimea of 6 May 1992, which 
declares the right of citizens of the Republic of Crimea to dual 
citizenship? (Yes or No). 
  C. You are in favor of granting the decrees by the president 
of the Republic of Crimea on issues that are temporarily 
unregulated by the legislation of the Republic of Crimea the 
force of law? (Yes or No). 
  Serhiy Tsekov, head of the Republican Party of Crimea, 
informed a UNIAN correspondent that the Republican Party of 
Crimea intends to picket the Crimea's Supreme Council session on 
11 March in support of the decree, which has been signed. 
  On the same day [10 March] the president of the Republic of 
Crimea signed another decree abolishing the Council of Ministers 
of Crimea as a body of executive power. In the transitional 
period, which will last until a new government headed by 
Yevgeniy Saburov is formed, employees of the Council of 
Ministers will carry out their duties.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 12 TASS -- Moscow newspapers focus 
their attention today on the Thursday meeting between President 
Yeltsin and representatives of political parties, parliamentary 
groups and public movements. The president's appeal for civil 
peace and accord was the keynote of the meeting. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries an article by Mikhail Mityukov, 
deputy chairman of the State Duma, who stresses that "the civil 
peace agreement would be a response to the demand of society... 
I am sure the civil peace agreement, which the president 
proposed to sign, has good prospects. To oppose it, to refuse 
to take part in the memorandum on accord would mean to 
demonstrate political ambitions, which are far from the real 
interests of the nation." 
  In the opinion of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, "civil peace and harmony 
are a vital necessity. They will give Russia the last chance 
today." The newspaper stresses that "civil peace is especially 
important for the army. It would be a kind of a guarantee from 
the temptation to settle political problems by non-political 
means." 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI publishes an interview with Finnish Prime 
Minister Esko Aho in connection with the official visit of 
Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, which began on Friday. In 
the opinion of Aho, "the time for cardinal decisions" has come 
in Russian-Finnish relations. He stressed, among other things, 
that the Finnish side is "especially interested in problems, 
connected with trade and economic cooperation." 
  Commenting on the murder of Deputy Chairman of the Council 
of 
Ministers of Tajikistan Moyonsho Nazarshoyev on March 11 in 
Dushanbe, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes that "the murder was 
hardly politically motivated. It was hardly the doing of 
`Islamic fundamentalists', as the authorities want to present 
it. Most probably, it was another one in a long chain of 
murders of high-ranking officials, organised by some armed 
group, made up of former members of the Popular Front." 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with Vasiliy Vorobyov, 
head of the main department of military budget and financing at 
the Russian Defence Ministry. He criticised the policy of the 
Russian Ministry of Finance, which reduced by 2.4 times in 1994 
budget allocations for the Defence Ministry. In the opinion of 
Vorobyov, "the Ministry of Finance is approaching the problem of 
the reduction of military spendings in a purely abstract way. 
It does not take into consideration the real situation and the 
tasks that the Russian Army and Navy have to fulfil in 
connection with troop withdrawal, the creation of proper 
conditions for the Army personnel in new areas of deployment and 
peace-keeping missions in the hotbeds of tension." 
  TRUD and RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA write about a new wave of the 
strike movement in the Rostov region, southern Russia, and in 
the southern Urals because the government fails to keep the 
promises, given to the miners, on the timely payment of wages to 
them. 
  Commenting on the resolution of the Presidium of the Russian 
Supreme Court on the resumption of the State Emergency Committee 
trial, PRAVDA writes that the continuation of the trial will be 
a farce and that, in the long run, the defendants will be 
acquitted.

  [Text] Minsk, 11 Mar -- A treaty on coordinating military 
activities was signed in Minsk today between the Republic of 
Belarus and the Russian Federation. Under the treaty, which has 
been concluded for a term of 5 years, the sides undertake to 
cooperate in the military sphere, and "in the event of an attack 
on one of the states they will consult each other." Belarus and 
Russia are also preserving links in the manufacture of military 
equipment and the exchange of documents and other materials, as 
well as scientific developments in this sphere, and they will 
cooperate in the exporting of military equipment to third 
countries. 
  The treaty also envisages joint actions by Russia and 
Belarus 
in training military cadres and safeguarding the social and 
labor guarantees of servicemen located in or moving through the 
territory of the neighboring states. It also envisages the 
maintenance of the existing set-up for the use of the air 
network and communication systems. The sides have undertaken to 
share the cost of maintaining military cantonments. 
  The document was signed by Georgiy Tarazevich, the 
Belarusian 
first deputy foreign minister, and Igor Saprykin, the Russian 
ambassador to Minsk.

<F P=106> [Question-and-answer portion of news conference by Ukrainian </F>
President Leonid Krachuk in Kiev on 11 March -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Danylo [surname indistinct], for 
the journals PHILOSOPHICAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL THOUGHT and EASTERN 
ECONOMIST. Esteemed Mr. President, you have just returned from 
an official visit to the United States. But there is no 
official information as to your meeting on Sunday night in New 
York with the management of the J.P. Morgan Group; for example 
there is not a word on that in this press release. The group's 
spokespersons did not confirm the report that you were there as 
a private person. I would like to ask you, in this connection, 
whether you could give official information as to specifically 
who you spoke to, what the subject and the results of the 
meeting were, and how it will help the state you have the honor 
to be head of. 
  [Kravchuk] I already said that I held many meetings with 
corporations, there was a meeting at the OPIC [Overseas Private 
Investment Corporation], a meeting with a group of businessmen 
led and organized by the Fund for Assistance to Ukraine's 
Independence, and a meeting with the United States' largest 
corporations, such as Johnson and Johnson, Pepsico, and other 
very large companies. And all the discussions that concerned 
our meetings were conducted along the lines of encouraging 
investment in Ukraine. As reported in the U.S. and other press 
by such people as the president of OPIC, they gave figures that 
these corporations could invest considerable funds in Ukraine 
that amount to billions of dollars, and that OPIC takes upon 
itself the task of insuring these [investments] and other things. 
  That is to say that there were no secrets during the 
meetings. As regards the fact that something might not have been 
reported in greater detail, the president does not have private 
meetings. This is obvious. There were no secrets because as a 
rule correspondents were present at all of these meetings and 
they were reported. Perhaps we did not receive something. This 
is another matter. We reached an agreement with this body that 
specific instructions would be issued after the meeting with our 
Foreign Economic Relations Ministry and other corresponding 
structures that would elaborate official documents with regard 
to this large company participating in investment in Ukraine. 
This was the main task. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Esteemed Leonid Makarovych. You 
often speak about the political consequences and bilateral 
relations. You have just mentioned that the official visit to 
the United States also had an influence on multilateral 
relations with regard to our state. Please comment on Russia's 
reaction to the success of your visit. 
  [Kravchuk] I would like you to take into account a minor 
matter. There is the reaction from Russia and there is the 
reaction from Russia's mass media. Russia's reaction is the 
reaction of the president, the prime minister, and corresponding 
structures. Regarding the reaction of the mass media, then this 
is not a Russian reaction. As they say in Odessa, these are two 
different things. 
  It seemed to me that the Russian mass media still regard 
themselves as the central newspapers, as it used to be under the 
USSR when they were divided according to rank: central, 
republican, and local newspapers. They have not yet become 
accustomed to the fact that they are Russian [newspapers]. They 
consider themselves to be central. If they are central then 
this gives them the right to be scathing about anybody, in 
particular within the framework of the CIS. Regarding how they 
do this and what terminology and methods they use, then this is 
not my misfortune but the misfortune of those who write about it 
and is evidence of their culture and diplomatic status. This is 
what I think. I think it is improper for me to comment on 
articles in the mass media. This is a matter for you. 
  [Correspondent Lelytska] Lelytska, press service of the 
Congress of National Democratic Forces of Ukraine. Esteemed Mr. 
President. Could the change in U.S. policy toward Ukraine be 
interpreted as though Ukraine is already emerging from Russia's 
sphere of influence; and the second question, Yuriy Meshkov, the 
newly-appointed president of Crimea, is dismissing Ukrainian 
journalists, and is also reducing Ukrainian TV and radio. Will 
there be an official reaction from Kiev? Thank you. 
  [Kravchuk] I would like to stress something that I have 
often 
spoken about and stressed. Ukraine's relations with Russia have 
a special status. We never -- in any case I, as president, and 
the government -- spoken about reducing or lowering the status 
or in some way reviewing our conceptual relations with Russia. 
They could be friendly and based on partnership, and I am 
convinced that will be the case, irrespective of the fact of how 
events will develop. History leaves us with no other option. We 
may only talk about how official Moscow and official Kiev are 
considering these relations. We consider them to be equal, 
friendly and based on partnership. I think that is how official 
Moscow considers them to be and indeed how it should consider 
them to be. 
  Regarding unofficial structures that exist in Russia, and 
incidentally they also exist in Ukraine, they may interpret them 
as they please. But this interpretation should only be accepted 
as a basis for further discussion and analysis. But this is not 
the official position of Kiev nor of Moscow. There should be an 
appropriate rank and status for these assessments and 
interpretations. For this reason we are not setting a task that 
Ukraine now...[pauses] You said that it is under the influence 
of Russia. I would like this to be a mutual influence: Russian 
influence on democratic process in Ukraine and Ukrainian 
influence on democratic processes in Russia. If that is how the 
issue were to be put, and if we all understood it to be the case 
then it would be to Russia's and Ukraine's benefit. I am deeply 
convinced of this. There is no other alternative for us. Russia 
is a great state, this is a real historic fact and it has its 
own long-term interests, including in Europe and in Ukraine. 
And for it to suddenly lose its...[pauses] It is simply 
impossible for me, as the president of Ukraine, to interfere 
with Russia's long-term interests. I can only hope that these 
Russian interests and influences in Ukraine are positive, that 
this influences democratic reform, market reform, stability, 
partnership, and friendship. If this is the kind of policy then 
it has a sense and good results, but if it is otherwise then it 
is dangerous. 
  That is why our relations with the United States are not a 
counterbalance to relations with Russia. I would like this to 
be understood by everyone. Many people simply do not want to 
think about this. I read the Russian mass media and it is 
somewhat painful to read this when they do not understand simple 
matters. We never said that we wanted to cooperate normally 
with somebody to harm Russia. The contrary is true. I have 
become convinced that the United States is most interested in 
peace and accord between Russia and Ukraine. The United States 
is most interested in this. But their interest depends on our 
policies and on how we understand this in Ukraine, Kiev and 
Moscow. If we understand that we are partners, that we are 
historically doomed to be partners in friendship, then this 
corresponds to the long-term strategic interests of both Europe 
and the world. Unfortunately, I cannot say today that everybody 
understands it in this way. 
  Well, I hope this is a formative period for the new 
authorities in Crimea and its new power institutions. We know 
from the first experience of establishing, for example, 
presidential structures that paved their way for the first time 
in our land and in the lands of the former Soviet Union, that 
these are painful processes. Sometimes, people pursuing this 
policy do not reckon with the real situation. I would not like 
this kind of start, and we will protect the interests of not 
only the media in Crimea, but the interests of all the people in 
Crimea, their rights and freedoms. This accords with our 
Constitution and our strategic political [word indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent Heorhiy Chornomorskyy, in Russian] [Word 
indistinct] Heorhiy Chornomorskyy. You were saying, Leonid 
Makarovych, that the United States is granting us additional 
financial aid. But Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk said 
yesterday that we would have to pay this year's gas debts in 
dollars. Will this aid suffice to settle our accounts by the 
time the new bill arrives in April? 
  [Kravchuk] I understand. Nobody has ever given anybody a 
loan to pay fuel debts. This is not envisaged by the 
legislation of, in this case, the United States. Critical 
import loans are a special kind of loans, there are critical 
import loans, fuel import loans, loans on preferential terms, 
and nonreturnable loans. These groups of loans were not 
discussed. We discussed economic aid and aid toward nuclear 
arms elimination. But I can tell you this, whatever loans we 
may take, if our Ukrainian economy does not start working for 
real, does not start earning money, be it dollars or marks, no 
aid will help us. That is why we are aiming for start-up loans, 
in order to give a starting boost to the movement toward the 
market, privatization, stabilization of the finance-and-credit 
system, thus to make the economy self-sufficient. 
  What do we have now? Ukraine, for its economy, its resources 
and products is not a poor country. And yet we cannot earn hard 
currency. Why? I will tell you why. We could sell our 
products on the Russian market, that is not we, but our 
enterprises. However, every enterprise must sell not just on 
the market, but to another enterprise that they have a contract 
or a long-term agreement with, an agreement they signed 
previously. But Russian enterprises are out of rubles. You 
know this. Therefore, we cannot sell out products and earn 
these rubles to pay for fuel. 
  There is another way. We could sell traditional Ukrainian 
products to Europe. What is traditional? I also call them 
sensitive commodities. These are metal, metal goods, coal, 
chemical products, textiles, etc, that is goods that were 
traditionally sold to Europe. But we need quotas, which we do 
not have. Thus, we are in this complex situation. We have 
products, a labor force, a colossal potential, but we are unable 
to make money. In Russia, there is no money, and here [in 
Europe] there are no quotas. 
  There is another thing. After Ukraine and other states 
declared their independence, the strategic long-term economic 
policy in Russia was such that ministries were instructed to 
duplicate the products previously imported from Ukraine. Thus, 
many of those products are now manufactured in Russia itself. 
Hence, the stance of those who say we need to restore the old 
ties looks completely ill-considered. They are impossible to 
restore. In order to restore the old ties we need to break the 
ones we have now. We need new ties that would accord with the 
interests of Ukraine and Russia, we must deepen them on the 
basis of market reform and democratic change. Calls to restore 
the old ties today is simply beyond reality. 
  Many people, by the way, fail to realize this, the fact that 
a new situation has come to pass, both in Russia and Ukraine. 
Now we need, on the basis of the interests and needs of the 
Ukrainian and Russian economies and the population, to forge 
contacts between enterprises, and those enterprises who had 
already realized this made contact with one another without our 
help, and are not demanding any help from the presidents. They 
have found each other, and they are working, the only 
complication being the payment situation. So, do not take this 
aid to us as aid toward our payment for fuel. We must pay for 
fuel with the help of our own economy. Yes, we need aid, but as 
a start-up loan, or as critical import credits. 
  [Correspondent Kucherenko] Tamara Kucherenko, Radio Ukraine 
World Service. Esteemed Mr. President. During your U.S. visit, 
you met official representatives of the IMF and World Bank. How 
successful were these meetings? Did you talk about any specific 
programs in support of economic reforms in Ukraine? What 
specific financial resources can we count on, and are there any 
financial agreements to this effect? Did you discuss a 
stabilization fund for our national currency, if yes, what did 
you manage to achieve? 
  [Kravchuk] Even before the visit, back in January, our 
economic delegation led by Economy Minister Roman Shpek visited 
the United States and conducted extensive work with the IMF and 
its experts, and the World Bank. The World Bank and the IMF 
experts also worked in Ukraine. We are greatly helped in this 
matter by Mr. Kaufman, a World Bank representative who is 
working in Ukraine. One week before the visit, our delegation 
made up of the same people visited the United States and again 
worked with international financial organizations. And we 
managed to work out all the sections of a government and IMF 
program. There are about five of them. At issue now is putting 
all these sections into a single program. This program should 
be completed in the near future. 
  As I gathered from conversations with the representatives, 
the director, and the president of the World Bank and the IMF, 
there are grounds for saying this agreement is a positive one. 
As soon as the program is agreed, we can count both on credits 
and on a stabilization fund. Thus, at the end of March we 
should be able to say that this program has been completed and 
agreed on both sides, the government of Ukraine and these 
international organizations. 
  [Correspondent Kudryn] Mykhaylo Kudryn, EKSPRESS-KHRONIKA, 
Moscow, and RESPUBLIKA agency, Kiev. Pardon me, this is about 
our Ukrainian affairs. Recently, you have been saying in 
interviews for numerous media, particularly the SPIEGEL magazine 
and a group of freelance journalists led by Ihor Storozhuk, as 
well as in the United States, that if the election fails to take 
place on 27 March we are in store for a power vacuum. But the 
Supreme Council statement of 25 February says there will be no 
power vacuum, since the present Supreme Council will preserve 
its constitutional powers and will be active until March next 
year. Let me ask, who are we to believe, you, the popularly 
elected president of Ukraine, or our dear Supreme Council also 
popularly elected, or do we believe nobody at all? Thank you. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, first of all, whenever I speak about this 
issue I never say that it is precisely how it will be. I say, 
there could be a power vacuum. You accurately laid stress on 
this. I will give you an example, there is a constitution 
standard and this is how it really is. Until a new Supreme 
Council is elected, the old Supreme Council carries out its 
functions. But I ask myself, and in order not to offend 
anybody, let us take Mykola Khomenko, secretary of the 
president's administration, who is a deputy in Konotop electoral 
district, and on 27 March they elect Sydorenko instead of 
Fomenko [word indistinct]. One was elected under the Soviet 
regime when Ukraine was part of the USSR under that electoral 
law, and this one will be elected on 27 March, and he will be 
given authority by the Electoral Commission that there were no 
violations and that he was elected in accordance with the law. 
Which deputy do I consider to be more important? Do you 
understand? [passage omitted] 
  After this, the situation could worsen considerably, because 
[assume] there is no new Supreme Council, and new deputies have 
already been elected in place of the old ones. Assume they also 
come to Kiev and they ask: What are we to do? This is what I am 
talking about. How long will these elections go on for? Will 
they be finished immediately on 27 March or will they continue 
for two weeks or even longer. This period could be 
significantly complex. I am simply making a prognosis. I would 
like people to realize what this means. When I call on them to 
vote, I am doing it willingly because firstly, I know that it is 
an important stage and secondly, because no democratic country 
can consider itself really democratic if parliament and the 
freedom of political parties are absent from it. This is not a 
democratic state. I understand the difficulties, economic 
problems, etc. but voters must understand that they must elect a 
new Supreme Council. I do not want to predict now what type of 
parliament it will be, or how many democrats or partocrats will 
be there. I do not want to analyze this situation now. I want 
to say only one thing: We need a new parliament that would 
represent Ukraine on the basis of a new electoral law and 
freedom etc., as a democratic state. 
  Regarding the elections that follow, this is another 
problem. 
I have already told you about them. Let us say, what kind of 
president will be elected? One that is set out in the 
Constitution, as the present one who is head of state and of the 
executive power with his powers, or another kind of president? 
There is no law. 
  Next point. What sort of powers will the elected head of the 
council at town, village, rayon, and oblast level have? What 
sort of relations will he have with the center, the president, 
and the government? Which law governs his powers and functions? 
There is no law. 
  There is, therefore, a danger that somebody could be elected 
tomorrow over whom the voters have no real influence. It will 
depend, therefore, on the individual who may or may not 
understand the situation. Since individuals vary one cannot 
count on understanding. It is necessary to clearly indicate 
this in law. Because I am saying this, it does not mean that I 
am defending my interests. I am describing the real situation 
so that the people and the mass media understand it, so they do 
not look for pitfalls, but see the real situation and the 
dangers for Ukraine if we really feel for Ukraine, not in words 
but in deeds. 
  [Correspondent Lemin] Olha Lemin, VYBIR information agency. 
The presidential elections are taking place at the same time as 
local elections. What do you mean that the presidential 
elections and local elections should be slightly delayed? If 
you did not mean this, then who will make the decision for the 
local elections to be held separately from the presidential 
elections? 
  [Kravchuk] I said both together. I do not separate the 
presidential [elections] and the local power bodies. The way I 
see it, is that the parliament adopts the appropriate laws with 
regard to the president and the local power bodies, clearly 
delimits their powers and functions, their rights, obligations 
and relations in detail, and sets this out in the constitution 
because this is the power. We have an example of two laws being 
adopted about the presidential representative and the local 
organs of power, and if these provisions had not been written in 
the Constitution...[pauses] You are aware that during every 
session somebody says: This is unconstitutional. This is 
reality. Power should be written into the Constitution. It is 
obligatory. This is why I am saying that two laws should be 
adopted, first one and then the other. They should both be 
elected. When? When the law is adopted. We cannot first elect 
them then pass a law. [passage omitted] I am not dividing them. 
I want them to be elected at the same time but only after laws 
are passed. This is an obligatory norm. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Japanese TV and Radio 
corporation [word indistinct]. Could you tell us, Mr. 
President, whether Ukraine plans to dismantle all of its nuclear 
weapons, and what the prospects are for getting real security 
guarantees after their elimination. 
  [Kravchuk] According to the trilateral agreement, Ukraine 
will dismantle all of its nuclear arms. Incidentally, START I, 
which the Supreme Council has ratified, and Paragraph 5 of the 
Lisbon Protocol reservations on which have been lifted, imply 
precisely that -- elimination of all nuclear arms. According to 
the bilateral agreements, in particular those with Russia, 
Ukraine will abide by its commitments provided other states do 
the same and abide by their commitments, without creating 
complications during the period of eliminating nuclear arms. We 
must find ways to solve the most complex issues without putting 
brakes on this extremely important process for the entire world 
and all the people. 
  As for security guarantees, the United States, Russia, and 
other states have given their consent for such guarantees, and 
this is no longer any problem. Our ministry is currently 
working on a relevant mechanism to determine whether it will be 
a statement or an agreement, who will sign it and what its 
content will be. But we also realize that both Russia and the 
United States tie the provision of security guarantees in a 
documented form with the ratification of the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty [NPT], although, by lifting the reservations as to the 
Lisbon Protocol, Ukraine has committed itself to joining the NPT 
as a non-nuclear state. It is a commitment and not mere words, 
but the NPT has to be ratified. Relevant documents have been 
submitted to the Supreme Council, and we will work persistently 
together with the ministry and the Cabinet of Ministers in order 
to gradually push it through and work this problem out. 
  I am convinced that Ukraine will, in accordance with its 
obligations and the conceptual principles it declared, act 
consistently in this sensitive global area. This is a long-term 
and fundamental policy for our state. 
  [Correspondent Zavytskyy] Myroslav Zavytskyy, NASHE SLOVO 
and 
ZA VILNU UKRAYINU newspapers. Esteemed Mr. President. The 
world views Ukraine with great hope as a factor of stability in 
(?this) part of Europe. But will the polls, which (Parnishkov) 
and his colleagues from Donetsk and Lugansk intend to conduct, 
not have negative consequences for this stability and for the 
preservation of Ukraine's unity? 
  The second question, essentially a domestic one: How long 
will the attendants at the president's palace and other 
government structures address visitors in languages other than 
Ukrainian? Thank you. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, one could reply to the second question 
formally thus: that in our law on languages of the Ukrainian 
SSR, as you remember, five years were given for people to be 
addressed thus. The five years are not up yet. But in this case 
I am against these five years. I believe that individuals in 
Ukraine can communicate in any language. That is their right. 
But as far as officials are concerned, and on official 
premises, then this should be in Ukrainian. This is the norm of 
any state. Well, whoever does not do this, perhaps he didn't 
have enough time or intelligence or the talent to master the 
Ukrainian language. Or perhaps he has simply forgotten about 
this law. We will remind them of it. But if you tell me the 
names, I could remind them more precisely. 
  Now, with regard to the first question about the poll that 
is 
being conducted. Well, I knew that this issue is an acute one, 
and so I have already brought something here. I knew that this 
question would be asked without fail, especially as edicts have 
already been signed by Crimea's president. That is, at issue 
there is a poll of three questions in President Meshkov's edict. 
  The first one: Are you in favor of renewing the clause in 
the Republic of Crimea's constitution, which was there back in 
May 1992, regulating relations between Crimea and Ukraine on the 
basis of treaties and agreements? That is the first question. 
The second: do you favor the Republic of Crimea's citizens 
having the right to dual citizenship? And the third: are you in 
favor of edicts from the Republic of Crimea's president on 
issues unregulated by legislation having the force of law? 
  Well, I will simply remind you that this was already in the 
Republic of Crimea's constitution in 1992. It was there. For 
example, if one takes the first issue, there was this formula of 
6 May 1992 in these words: The Republic of Crimea is part of 
the state of Ukraine and determines its relations with it on the 
basis of treaties and agreements. 
  But then on 25 September 1992, after Ukraine submitted a 
request to the Supreme Council to bring its Constitution in line 
with Ukraine's Constitution, it was noted thus: The Republic of 
Crimea is part of the composition of Ukraine and determines its 
relations with it on the basis of mutually agreed legislative 
acts and agreements. That is, these issues were in the 
constitution. Crimea's Supreme Council withdrew them and 
brought them into line with Ukraine's constitution. 
  Now, by means of a referendum -- consultative referendums 
and 
referendums are envisaged there in the law on referendums of the 
republic of Crimea. Polls are not envisaged. But a poll is 
possible in a resolution by Crimea's Supreme Council. Well, 
clearly it has no legislative or legal force. We are currently 
studying this issue. Our group of lawyers is studying it. That 
is, in whatever aspect it appears, it has no legal force. This 
is, well, an important element. 
  It seems to me that it would be better to wait until 
Ukraine's constitution is adopted and act so that the interests 
of all regions are taken account of most fully in the 
constitution, and not to push people toward, say, confrontation, 
to an exacerbation of the situation. This is not a noble 
matter, but nobility is a relative concept. And the law, which 
is adopted, has legal force, and we will be guided namely by the 
law in our actions, and not by moral norms, because they are not 
noted, for example, in the legislative regulation of these 
problems. I expect that we will find a resolution of this 
issue. If it creates conflict, say, our services study it and 
come to this conclusion, then we will try to find a mutually 
acceptable resolution. But one thing is clear, whatever the 
outcome, it will not have legal force. 
  [Correspondent Tykhyy] Esteemed Mr. President. Serhiy 
Tykhyy, UNIAN agency. Esteemed Mr. President: It is well known 
that one of the fundamental conditions for investing in the 
economy of another state is political and economic stability. 
If one is to proceed from your statement about your refusal to 
stand in the June presidential elections, and also your 
arguments for this stance, and also that which has been said at 
this press conference today, it is too early at the moment to 
speak of stability in Ukraine. In this connection my question 
is this: What arguments and what guarantees did you use in your 
conversations with your U.S. interlocutors to persuade them to 
invest funds in Ukraine's economy? Thank you. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, in general to speak of some kind of serious 
stability in the transitional period -- from one life to 
another, from one society to another, from one economic system 
to another, and the political system, and the spiritual belief 
system, and the spiritual view of those problems -- is probably 
not easy. But everyone sees that in spite of all this in this 
time we in Ukraine have won independence without conflicts, that 
we are working without some kind of confrontational encounters, 
where blood is shed, where people shoot and kill. 
  That is, I can say absolutely that we have peace and calm in 
Ukraine. And this is the most important sign of stability. But 
such stability as is connected with forming bodies of power 
cannot be identified, for example, if there is a president, then 
there is stability; if there is no president, then straight away 
there is no stability; if there is a Supreme Council, there is 
stability; if there is no Supreme Council, there is no 
stability. At issue is a vacuum of power. This is what it is 
about. 
  This is why I say: If a situation arises whereby this vacuum 
becomes a reality, then the president should be highly 
responsible, for he has been elected by the people, and he 
cannot run for election at this time. Well, what sort of a 
president is it who stands for election in these circumstances, 
tell me please. He would then have put himself on a par with 
the other contenders. 
  Say, for example, the Supreme Council had not been formed. 
Accordingly the government, the new government with a new 
program, similarly to the Supreme Council, had not been formed 
-- and the president runs for election. Then all the bodies of 
power in the localities run for election. This is what is at 
issue. 
  That is why I say that at this time I, if these steps have 
not been taken, if the Supreme Council has not been elected and 
if the government has not been formed, then the Supreme Council 
(?sets to work), it produces a program, it appoints a new 
government, together with the president naturally, at least in 
accordance with the current constitution. The government 
assumes power. One might even manage to adopt a law on the 
Cabinet of Ministers. Then there is a Supreme Council, there is 
a Cabinet of Ministers, its powers and relations have been 
determined. Then one can take the next step. This is what it 
is about. 
  I do not want you to connect, well, some kind of 
exacerbation 
of instability namely with this. This will not be. After all 
there is a president. And he has responsibility. There are 
bodies of power in the localities. This is the most important 
thing. There are deputies of the current composition of 
parliament, who can still assemble before 27 March, and if the 
good will is there, as they say, resolve these questions too. 
Why not? If there are laws, they can be adopted. That is, one 
cannot say that we are now in a dead-end. There are realistic 
possibilities. They should be made use of. 
  But I convinced, well, how did I convince my, say, partners? 
I related to them the true situation, which exists in Ukraine. 
Incidentally, they know about it very well. One cannot say now 
that the situation in Ukraine is worse than in other regions. I 
can say absolutely that it is not worse, and in many cases 
better even. I would only wish that all of us together 
understood it thus, all together. Because some understand that 
this Ukrainian, this political striptease, is the biggest 
victory for those who write or speak. I think otherwise. 
  [Correspondent Skachko] Volodymyr Skachko, NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA. Mr. President, when arguing your refusal to run in the 
election, you said that you were offended by deputies, by the 
press, which supposedly badgers the president, who has been 
elected by the people. So this is my question: on the scales of 
history whose outrage is worse, yours at the press and deputies, 
or that of the people, who are still waiting for economic 
reforms? That is, to put the question more specifically: to what 
extent has your "Five D's" program been implemented? This is 
the first thing. 
  Second: I would simply like to draw attention to the fact 
that such a thing has never occurred in this hall before -- news 
conferences always were held live. People simply came and wrote 
their names down and conveyed information. This time Comrade 
Ivanyn (?simply) pushed to one side a whole lot of journalists 
and brought in those whom he believes are of his opinion. So I 
would simply like to tell both your press secretary and you that 
if he wanted to do something for your image in this way, it is 
simply not done in this way. 
  [Kravchuk] I do not know what you mean on the second point. 
I understand this question as an observation to our press 
service that it should take account of your wishes for some kind 
of record, you understand, I cannot even imagine what you are 
talking about. What record? A record of what? I do not 
understand this. But if you have a question in the hall, then 
you can put any question you like. Raise your hand and I will 
ask you to raise it, and I do not think that this is a problem 
for our hall. We can debate for as long as you have the 
strength, and I will have sufficient strength. That is the first 
thing. 
  The second thing: I did not say that I was offended. I 
always emphasize that in politics one should never take offense 
at anyone. One can only be offended by close people, by those 
with whom we have some kind of mutual relations. But in 
politics taking offense is out of place. I am talking about 
something else -- that Ukraine can become a phenomenon, first, 
in how our own home-grown lords are undressing their own Ukraine 
in public, and consider this to be an achievement. 
  Second, I said that Ukraine could become a phenomenon of the 
consolidated boorishness in relation to the president elected by 
the people, namely boorishness. Because the Ukrainian language 
is very rich in words, in intonations, and in accents. Culture 
means that one can make use of this to express everything one 
needs to -- whether to the president or to anyone else. I said 
that I am not going to compete with anyone in boorishness 
because I know in advance that I am doomed to defeat. Because I 
know the capabilities of those, who are competing in this. I 
know their capabilities. Especially as I have never set myself 
the task, and will never set myself the task of shutting someone 
up. 
  If he has a pen, and Ukraine has given him the freedom of 
speech, namely independent Ukraine, before speaking one should 
think about whom this benefits. I always say that before taking 
any political decision or writing -- if you have children, come 
home in the evening, sit them down opposite you and look into 
their eyes and listen to what is happening -- refugees, death, 
blood, -- and then write, then call on people to act. 
  It is namely this that I was talking about. I am convinced 
that no nation, no people, in the person of its intelligentsia, 
in the person of its elite, to which incidentally journalists 
belong, and whom I sincerely respect, will not become famous by 
being boorish or disrespectful to persons who have been elected 
by the people. They can face elections again, they can be, say, 
if they are involved in crime or something, there are 
appropriate bodies to deal with this. But there is no need 
whatever to compete in this. I advise you not to make use of 
these methods, because history has its own ways. (?Everything) 
that is written is to be remembered and submitted to the 
archives. Each person will be answerable to history, and for 
culture and for everything which has been done, and for the five 
D's, and for the six Ds, and for the three Ps, and will be 
answerable for everything. 
  [Correspondent Veresen] Mykola Veresen, BBC. I would like to 
ask two questions to clarify details. What will the president 
of Ukraine, that is, you, do in the event that the Russians do 
not compensate for the missiles, which have already gone to 
Ukraine. As far as we understand, as far as I understand, there 
was to be a simultaneous crossing of the border by missiles on 
the part of Ukraine, and fuel elements, or compensation, on the 
part of Russia. Second, what will you do if Crimea separates 
despite everything -- because there is going to be a poll on the 
27th and they will have grounds to leave Ukraine. The mood 
there is that the majority of people do not want to belong to 
Ukraine. 
  [Kravchuk] I will start from the second question. I have 
read the questions to you. There is nothing there about what 
you are saying with regard to separating. The issue is dual 
citizenship and in what sort of composition the Republic of 
Crimea finds itself in Ukraine. On the contrary. There is 
nothing about separating. So that is not at issue. I cannot 
say on the basis of these three questions, which I expressed for 
you -- here they are -- that the poll is about separating. That 
is not there. Therefore, we will not speak about this. I am 
talking about the legal and lawful force of this, say, edict, 
which in this case we are studying, in relation to Ukraine's 
constitution and in relation to the law on the delimitation of 
powers between Ukraine and the republic of Crimea. This is the 
only area in which I can comment. 
  Well, we have concluded an agreement with Russia -- it has 
been signed -- on compensation for the weapons, which have been 
taken out of Ukraine -- missiles are not taken out, warheads are 
taken out -- on respective compensation for uranium, which is in 
the form of fuel elements and fuel assemblies for Ukrainian 
nuclear power stations. This will be implemented. However, if 
one side suddenly ceases to implement it, then the other side 
will cease to implement it as well. This is a normal 
phenomenon; this is how it will be, but I do not expect it to 
come to this. We should work at it because this is in the 
interests of everyone -- Ukraine and Russia and the whole world. 
One cannot stop this process, say, by some unwise decision. 
Whoever is the first to make this decision will bear all of the 
historial responsibility for this. 
  [Makarovych] Leonid Makarovych, (?INTERFAX-Ukraine). Tell 
me, please, what your attitude is to the possibility of the 
Russian joint stock company Gazprom being given the controlling 
package of shares in the flotation of Ukrainian gas pipelines 
and gas repositories on Ukraine's territory? This proposal was 
made yesterday at the talks in Moscow. Thank you. 
  [Kravchuk] I know that we have long been discussing this 
issue on the flotation of, for example, our enterprises in 
Ukraine, including oil processing enterprises, and on setting up 
an appropriate Ukrainian corporation, for example Ukrnaftohaz 
[Ukrainian oil and gas]. This issue is also being raised. 
Setting up such a corporation and setting up joint stock 
enterprises, which will be part of this corporation -- this 
issue is being analyzed and documents are being elaborated. The 
issue is that the Ukrainian side must have the controlling 
package of shares without fail. This is an indispensable norm. 
We will not agree to another. 
  [Makarychenko] Leonid Makarychenko, Intelnews agency. 
Esteemed Leonid Makarovych, I would still like to get a more 
precise reply to the question of whether the movement of fuel 
for Ukraine's nuclear power stations in the reverse direction, 
from Russia, has begun. Second, will your accord with Russia and 
the United States, your dialogue, allow a market to open to 
Ukrainian enterprises for conventional armaments? Third, 
Ukraine's space program -- the carriers, which launch space 
ships, can also easily launch other loads. Will these 
limitations not concern space programs? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, we have just taken out 60 warheads. So, 
this is not yet such a, say, large amount that one can talk 
about a reverse movement. We are to take out 200 warheads by 
May, the end of May. An appropriate scheme is being elaborated. 
I stress that the agreement, which has been concluded and signed 
by Ukraine and Russia, envisages this -- that is, whenever this 
may be, for example, in one week or in two, but it is envisaged. 
This does not mean that fuel assemblies meet nuclear warheads, 
greet each other, and go their separate ways. There should be a 
certain time, but this is envisaged in the agreement. That is, 
both in the trilateral statement and in the documents affixed to 
it this is envisaged. Noone, neither Russia nor Ukraine, have 
refused to do this. That is, this will be carried out. 
  I have already stressed to you that we submitted a draft 
document to the United States on cooperation in the sphere of 
space technology. In our conversations, and also at the 
Pentagon, we found support for participation by the United 
States. Prior to this we also had appropriate consultations and 
relations with French managers about the possibility of 
cooperation in the sphere of space technology, taking into 
account that this is, well, highly developed here, as we say, 
both the construction of the rockets themselves and the systems 
for controlling the rockets. 
  Approximately...[pauses] not approximately, but on 22 March 
a 
delegation from the United States will come to Ukraine. It is 
headed by [U.S. Defense Secretary] Minister [William] Perry, and 
these issues will be further elaborated. That is, we have put 
them on the agenda, and we will elaborate them. That is, this 
is not being taken off the agenda. We want our rocket 
technology, our experience, our, say, priorities here, to be 
made use of not only for the benefit of Ukraine, but for the 
possibilities of other states. The United States and other 
countries have an understanding attitude to this. 
  What else did you ask? [Makarychenko's reply indistinct] We 
did not discuss this issue in the United States with anyone. 
  [Krushko] Ihor Hrushko, HOLOS UKRAYINY. Leonid Makarovych, I 
have one question for you, which is important in my opinion, 
which my colleagues have not considered. As is well known, 
during the trilateral talks in Moscow the question of 
compensation to Ukraine for the tactical nuclear weapons, which 
were taken out of Ukraine, was also raised. The question was 
raised, but as far as I know, it has not been resolved yet. 
Please tell me, when you were in Washington, did you discuss 
this with the American President? 
  [Kravchuk] We discussed this with the Russian side and in 
this agreement, which I mentioned has been initialled and is to 
be signed on the part of Russia and Ukraine by their respective 
governments, such compensation is envisaged, and it is envisaged 
as a whole. All of this is noted in this document. 
  [Verchuk] Mr. President, tell me, did people go to the 
United 
States with you who are capable of creating competitive 
production or were they mainly intermediaries? For we can get 
out of the economic crisis only when we begin to produce 
competitive products. Stepan Verchuk. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, products are produced by people. These are 
workers, engineers, designers. These people did not go with me, 
because there are 52 million such people in Ukraine in all. 
Ministers and advisors came with me. They do not produce 
products, but that Ukraine can produce competitive products is a 
real fact. [passage omitted] 
  That is, there are colossal possibilities in Ukraine for 
going over to the best competitive products. However, you see 
the situation that has arisen. All of these products were 
produced on the basis of raw materials and energy-carriers, 
which came from other states, but now prices have gone up 
thousands of times. We have ended up in a difficult situation. 
[passage omitted] Everything has to be reformed. The structure 
has to be changed. We have to make what we have the 
possibilities for and find our niche on the world market, in 
Europe and America. 
  Incidentally, our agreements envisage all of this, that 
goods 
will move and that there will not be, say, these various customs 
hindrances, or dual taxation. That is, all of this is 
envisaged. Time is needed. [passage omitted] We have to take on 
board experience; we have to work. The main thing is that all 
are convinced that only by working can the problem be shifted. 
There is no other way. Not a single country has yet resolved 
its problems without people beginning to work in an organized 
and qualified way, making use of their own possibilities. There 
is no other way. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] POLITYKA I CHAS [POLITICS AND 
TIME]. Esteemed Mr. President, we have received information 
that part of the money that Washington will give us for economic 
assistance will be spent on purchasing grain or soya. Would it 
not be more expedient to buy progressive technology with this 
money? I understand that noone in the United States is going to 
sell us anything very good, because at the same time if they 
give us the opportunity to sell our natural resources, they will 
lose a market, the Russian market. But are work and searches 
under way in this direction, for example, among the Ukrainian 
diaspora in the United States, in that agricultural country 
Argentina, for example, where Ukrainians play a large role in 
agriculture, because this is a very topical issue? [passage 
omitted] 
  [Kravchuk] Well, this money will not be spent on purchase 
of grain. This money includes 352 million for nuclear arms 
elimination and 350 million to solve our economic problems 
having to do with, first of all, know-how, structural reform, 
privatization, and other factors. The issue about granting us a 
credit to buy pesticides and [word indistinct] is dealt with 
separately but it does not concern grain. What is special about 
these credits is that they take account of everything: If we 
are allowed, say, 150 million this year for nuclear arms 
elimination, we must decide together where this money should be 
channelled to, whether more could be channelled toward fuel 
processing, the dismantling of a part of the infrastructure, the 
elimination of warheads, missiles, and other areas. We also, 
however, have a problem with conversion, a problem with housing 
for officers, a problem with social security. During our talks 
at the Pentagon and with the secretary of defense, we emphasized 
the need to use more money for these purposes, to ensure social 
stability. Thus, this money is for a specific purpose. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Kurbas, in Russian] Oleksiy Kurbas, KOMMERSANT UKRAINY. The 
new credits will be granted to Ukraine on condition that market 
reforms continue. Meanwhile, our government has won a 
reputation of being against reforms. Can we expect, therefore, 
any changes in the cabinet in the near future? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, this is not the case of a new government 
coming to power and making itself a reputation. Many of the 
present members worked under former Prime Ministers [Vitold] 
Fokin and [Leonid] Kuchma. Incidentally, this government 
inherited all the members of the previous one, formed by Leonid 
Danylovych [Kuchma] together with the Supreme Council, and I do 
not deny my own hand in this. However, one can say this: If 
you take the current reforms -- say, privatization -- and 
measure them then you will see that real privatization has only 
just begun, I mean real, not verbal, privatization. For 
example, recently the Kramatorsk heavy machine-building plant 
was privatized. 
  I was asked today by representatives of the West, what are 
the criteria? What will be the next step? I will tell you: 
There are dozens of appeals in my daily mail coming from 
directors, who are often labelled red directors, saying that 
they want to have their enterprises privatized. Just a year ago 
nobody wrote this. On the contrary, they wrote: What are you 
doing? Where are you leading us? But now they write: Permit us 
to privatize. These are former leaders, Communists, labelled 
red and other labels. This is what they say now. Life itself 
leads an individual toward certain steps. If we are planning to 
privatize over 30,000 small, medium-sized, and large enterprises 
this year, and this has already begun to happen, this is real 
privatization, and these are real reforms. 
  We are talking about a certain extent of stabilization in 
the 
finance-and-credit system and a drop in inflation. I am not 
about to talk of great successes. I am afraid to. However, in 
January inflation was already 19 percent, and in February, 20 
percent. If you compare this to last year's, it is poles apart. 
I am not saying these are great successes, but you can see that 
something is breaking through and taking shape. Something new 
is being born, something old is dying, and something of the old 
is still holding on. Of course, I would like to see land reform 
gain pace. I would like other processes in the bank and credit 
system to gain pace. However, you cannot force them; otherwise 
you would have to use administrative methods, use force. People 
need to mature for this. 
  Take land reform, for example. It is a very painful issue. 
I recently returned from Lithuania where I spoke to President 
Brazauskas. The most serious problem for them today is the 
problem of the countryside, because they declared reforms in the 
countryside, gave land to the people, and now the people say, 
take it back. To take the land, one needs to have an 
infrastructure, not only for production but to know to whom and 
when to sell it, how to pay, to have mini-technology, and to 
know where to buy pesticides and mineral fertilizers, in order 
to be on the market. If you do not have all this, you can only 
declare reforms. You will end up killing the countryside, 
because it is not that simple. I do not think we can look at it 
this way: If we declare reforms today, they will take off 
tomorrow, because, whatever criticism you may fire at the 
Supreme Council, it did pass a privatization program for 1994 
the same way it approved anti-inflation measures. People change 
under the pressure of life, and reforms will take off. There is 
no alternative to that. We will not build socialism in one 
country, Ukraine. That is a fact, and everybody understands it. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Rudenko] SVOBODA newspaper, Raisa Rudenko. Do you believe 
that the improvement in relations between Ukraine and America 
will affect Ukraine's nation-building? Do you see it posing any 
threat to Ukrainian sovereignty? 
  [Kravchuk] How should one analyze this? If you analyze it 
from the point of purely Soviet Communist mentality, it would 
look like this: If a country is suddenly helping us, look 
deeper. If people interpreted the favorable attitude of the 
United States, its friendly attitude toward Ukraine, its 
willingness to help, like that, it would make one think. 
Because I remember the times when one was made to think that if 
any country is treating you well, you must look for some 
underlying reasons. However, I think those times are a thing of 
the past, and the majority of people understand that without the 
assistance of large countries, without their favorable attitude 
it is practically impossible to build an independent Ukraine. 
  A very important factor to me is the fact that the U.S. 
President said without reservation that he respects Ukraine's 
sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, and that 
this is something to be reckoned with. This was also said in 
other documents and statements. This was said in the trilateral 
statement signed in Moscow. Thus, I would like to say, if those 
who think that holding onto nuclear weapons one cannot use is a 
guarantee of security, continue to think so, then I guess they 
cannot think otherwise, they are doomed. 
  It is clear now that only with help, with support, with 
guarantees and good relations with the neighbors within the CIS 
and beyond we can build an independent Ukrainian state. If only 
we cna also come to terms among ourselves. [passage omitted] 
  Therefore, I am convinced that these kinds of relations are 
the only guarantee, provided we work ourselves, take advantage 
of this situation, and use this assistance in the interests of 
the economy and the people, that Ukraine will move faster toward 
reforms and toward a better lifestyle. Wondering whether 
Ukraine is to be or not to be, as some put it, is something I 
will never stand for. Ukraine is here to stay, by all means. 
Nobody can reverse the course of history. One can [word 
indistinct] it, one can impudently tear at it, but one has to be 
mad to wonder whether it is to be or not to be. Forgive me for 
saying this, but one gentleman said to me: What do you think, 
will Ukraine survive or not? I replied in a not-so-tolerant 
way: I have no doubt that Ukraine will survive as I have no 
doubt that it will outlive you. 
  [Boyko] Oksana Boyko, VECHIRNIY KIEV newspaper. Leonid 
Makarovych, I would like you to clarify two more aspects of your 
American visit. The Clinton administration is often accused of 
taking a personalized approach to relations with certain 
countries, particularly Russia, treating Russia as Yeltsin. It 
looks like the same personalization is taking place now in 
seeing Ukraine through Kravchuk. You were talking about the 
next presidential election. If there is an early election, and 
you indeed do not take part in it, do you think it will put a 
freeze on our thawing relations with America? Another thing: In 
January this year, American intelligence predicted that Ukraine 
may split into several separate nuclear states. Did you sense 
any reference to this prediction during your negotiations at the 
White House, or does the White House ignore the predictions of 
its intelligence? 
  [Kravchuk] I will begin with the second question. Why read 
American intelligence reports? Read our own publications and 
you will find there that Ukraine will definitely split into 
three or four or as many as one feels like, parts. No need for 
intelligence, you can read what we say and write ourselves. This 
does not mean that we cannot think this way or make predictions, 
but I would not think there are any grounds for seeing any 
tragedy in this. The main thing is for us to understand that 
our cause is to unite around the highest task of building an 
independent, democratic, law-governed, friendly, and peaceful 
Ukraine, one that takes advantage of its wealth; its natural, 
human, scientific, and technical potential; joins all European 
and world structures; makes friends with neighbors and does not 
settle any scores with anyone. I think we will cope with this 
task because we have no alternative. Everybody must understand 
this. 
  As for personalization, I talked about this in the United 
States when I was asked similar questions. By the way, nobody 
asked me this in the White House, but journalists did ask. I 
said: Ukraine is there, START-I has been ratified, and 
reservations have been lifted on Paragraph 5 of the Lisbon 
Protocol. Finally, there are programs set by the Supreme 
Council and the government. These are real facts. To turn away 
from this course, which has already begun to pave its way 
straight on the fields, at the factories, and in the mentality 
and souls of the people by consolidating this realization, would 
not be that simple. 
  Every period is associated with a certain personality, but 
this does not mean that the people would allow themselves to 
elect a president who would pursue a different course, against 
independence or against statehood. I cannot imagine that. 
People will not stand for that. They would elect a person who 
would fight for the state, for a democratic, law-governed state. 
If something should suddenly happen, well, there are zig-zags 
in history, but it would be impossible today. That is what I 
think, and there is no tragedy in it. There are no eternal 
presidents. Everyone must do his job and let others do theirs. 
It is up to the people to decide who they should elect. 
  Thank you for the meeting. I wish you all the best.

  [Text] Kiev, 10 Mar -- "Ukraine no longer has on its agenda 
the possibility of handing over its share of the Black Sea Fleet 
ships to Russia as a form of payment for its oil and gas debt." 
This has been stated in an interview with foreign journalists 
by Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, commander of Ukraine's Navy. He 
emphasized that the protocol signed in Massandra by Presidents 
Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk was only a protocol of intent. 
The handover of the Ukrainian part of the Fleet has never been 
a way out of the situation that has come about. 
  According to the commander, the issue has been studied and 
rejected. The handover of the Ukrainian part of the Fleet to 
Russia is no longer being discussed. Instead, both sides are in 
agreement on creating a commission to inventorize the ships and 
other fleet property for the purpose of dividing them up in 
accordance with the yet earlier accords between the presidents 
of the two countries. In Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy's opinion the 
Fleet should be divided equally before the end of 1995.

  [Text] Sevastopol -- In an interview with BBC Television on 
10 March, Black Sea Fleet Commander Admiral Eduard Baltin stated 
that the Black Sea Fleet remains an operational strategic 
formation capable of fulfilling its tasks. He emphasized that 
at the moment, Moscow is engaged to a greater extent in material 
and technical provisions for the Black Sea Fleet. Disruptions 
in supplying the fleet are due to the economic state of both 
Ukraine and Russia. 
  The Black Sea Fleet commander evaluated the morale of 
personnel as satisfactory and capable of ensuring the completion 
of tasks set for the fleet. "This was tested in the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict," said the admiral. 
  According to information from the Black Sea Fleet press 
center, Admiral Eduard Baltin agreed with the assertion of the 
television journalists that the fleet's dual subordination is an 
unusual phenomenon in world practice. In his opinion, such a 
situation does not create any problems for officers, as the 
latter are subordinate to the fleet's command. However, 
problems sometimes arise for the command. 
  The Black Sea Fleet commander expressed the hope that the 
presidents of Russia and Ukraine will solve the problems of the 
fleet in the near future, proceeding from the military-political 
tasks facing it: "I am currently subordinate to two 
presidents," stated the admiral, "and I concur with them on all 
of my operational actions. As for some of the high-ranking 
military, I have gotten used to some dissatisfaction on their 
part. I think that the presidents will make the right decision, 
taking into account the military-political situation and 
economic possibilities. In my opinion, Russia and Ukraine do 
not have great differences, and those that they do have will be 
resolved by political means."

  [Text] Baku (March 12) TURAN -- A meeting between the 
Armenian and Azerbaijani speakers of parliament, Babken 
Ararktsyan and Rasul Guliyev, respectively, begins today. The 
meeting is to take place at a point along the border between the 
Azerbaijani district of Kazakh (Azerbaijan) and the district of 
Idzhevan (Armenia). According to preliminary information 
available, the sides will discuss settlement options for

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva, Viktor </F>
Shulman and AZERTAJ correspondent Natig Abdullayev] 
  [Text] Kazakh (Republic of Azerbaijan), 12 Mar -- The 
Armenian Armed Forces should leave within 20 days the territory 
of the Gubadlinskiy, Fizulinskiy, Dzhebrailskiy, Kelbadzharskiy 
Rayons of Azerbaijan that they occupy, and also the populated 
areas of the Lachinskiy Rayon of the republic, with the 
exception of the so-called Lachinskiy corridor. A preliminary 
agreement on this was reached today during talks between Rasul 
Guliyev and Babken Ararktsyan, head of the parliaments of 
Azerbaijan and Armenia that took place in the Kazakhskiy Rayon 
of Azerbaijan on the frontier of the two republics. It went on 
for about an hour and a half behind closed doors in a specially 
isolated carriage set up on the border of the two Caucasian 
republics. 
  Reporting this at the news conference that took place at the 
end of the talks, Rasul Guliyev noted that under the accord, the 
Armed Forces of the warring sides will be simultaneously 
disengaged from each other by 10 km [as received]. A buffer 
zone will be created between them. The Armenian side is to 
withdraw its troops 10 km inside the territory of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, and the Azerbaijani Armed Forces will 
accordingly occupy the liberated areas to guarantee the safe 
return of the refugees. 
  The Azerbaijani parliament speaker said that the buffer zone 
will be handed over to the control of international observers. 
  As for the liberation of the Azerbaijani town of Shusha that 
is also occupied by Armenian troops, according to the chairman 
of the republic's Supreme Soviet, this will be discussed during 
the month at a meeting between experts of the two countries. In 
line with the planned schedule, this town situated right on the 
territory of Nagorno-Karabakh is to be liberated in two month's 
time. 
  Referring to what his Armenian colleague said, Rasul Guliyev 
stressed that "Armenia has never recognized and will never 
recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as an independent republic." 
  According to the statement by the Azerbaijani parliament 
head, the details of the accord that was reached will be 
examined specifically in two or three days time in Moscow at a 
meeting of representatives of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs 
and Defense of Azerbaijan and Armenia. He noted that Russia and 
other intermediaries, including the CSCE, will play their role 
in the peace-keeping process as before. 
  Speaking to journalists after the talks ended, Rasul Guliyev 
and Babken Ararktsyan noted the similarity of their opinions 
during the discussion of many questions. For instance, both 
sides agreed that the process of ceasing fire and stopping 
combat actions was irreversible. They also noted that despite 
all the complexity of the problem, it can be resolved by 
peaceful means. The head of the parliament of Armenia stressed 
in particular, that although representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh 
were not present at these talks, the Azerbaijani side for the 
first time did not object to their participation in the meeting. 
According to him, that bears witness to the fact that the sides 
are gradually finding points of contact. It was also reported 
that a meeting between experts of the two countries who are to 
draw up concrete proposals to achieve peace in the region will 
take place soon.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Mais Mamedov, including </F>
recorded comment by Armenian Supreme Council Chairman Babken 
Ararktsyan and Azerbaijani National Council Chairman Rasul 
Guliyev -- from the "Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Announcer Igor Vykhukholev Prospects for settling 
the Armenian-Azeri conflict were discussed by the heads of 
parliaments of the two warring republics in the Transcaucasus. 
  [Mamedov] Their conversation was conducted behind closed 
doors, and the only exception was made for Ostankino TV company 
correspondents. Judging from the large number of cigarette ends 
[video shows full ashtray], the conversation was far from easy. 
After all, many problems have accumulated over the six years of 
confrontation. All the more encouraging that both men say the 
meeting was very important, and moreover, positive. 
  [Guliyev] We have reached common understanding that all the 
territories of Azerbaijan have to be freed. We have reached a 
common view that some kind of buffer zone has to be created, and 
that observers with an international status have to be placed 
there. We have reached a view that after the freeing of the 
territory of Azerbaijan, the opening of communications and other 
things, we have to sit at the negotiating table and determine 
the status of Nagorno- Karabakh. 
  [Ararktsyan] Our conversation today [as received] was very 
brief, but on very important issues myself and Mr. Guliyev, and 
I hope also the leaderships of our two states in general, have 
some constructive and fruitful approaches, which, I hope, will 
be put into practice.

  [Text] As the Azerbaijani army failed to make gains in 
south-eastern parts of Karabakh, it has been desperately trying 
for the second day running to break through the Karabakh 
defences on the eastern section of the front. 
  A spokesman for the Army Headquarters of the self-proclaimed 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic has reported to Interfax that Friday 
night the Azerbaijanis tried to advance toward Agdam, but their 
attempt was dashed. 
  After intensive artillery shelling Saturday morning, the 
Azerbaijani forces resumed their offensive toward the Novruzlu 
community. According to reports from Stepanakert, the enemy was 
forced to retreat to where it had come from with casualties.

  [Text] Baku, 13 Mar -- Virtually the entire frontline is 
calm, the Azerbaijan Defense Ministry has reported. Armenian 
armed forces have had to suspend combat operations after 
sustaining heavy losses in battles on 5-7 March. Armenia has 
once again returned to discussing a ceasefire, but the prospect 
of a ceasefire does not suit some separatist forces, the 
document says. They demonstrated this once again on 12 March, 
the day when Rasul Guliyev, the Chairman of the Azerbaijan 
Supreme Soviet, was meeting Armenian representatives. Grad 
launchers and tanks fired on Azerbaijani positions in Agdam 
Rayon and also on the settlement of Ashala Seidakhmedli in 
Fizuli Rayon. Azerbaijani forces did not succumb to this 
provocation and to preserve conditions essential for peace talks 
did not return fire.

  [Text] Baku, March 12 (AZERTAC)--A trial for an attempt on 
President Aliyev's life was finished at the High Court of 
Azerbaijan today. The defendants guilt was established. The 
court sentenced Aydin Gassimov as an organizer and Abil Babayev 
as an accomplice to 12 years imprisonment. However they did not 
plead guilty. 
  A student from Turkey Hassan Toku, whom conspirators planned 
to be the assassin, was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The 
court, giving this judgment, took into consideration his honest 
confession and the fact that he had been a help with 
investigation. Cases of the other two defendants--Nariman 
Mamedov and Ali Askerov--were sent to additional inquiry because 
of inadequate evidence. Additional inquiry is also necessary 
because the two accomplices of the conspiracy aimed at attempt 
on president's life went into hiding.

  [Text] Paramilitary and riot police, as well as army, units 
have again started massing in the Ordubadskiy District and 
around the village of Kelekiy of the Ordubadskiy District in the 
Nakhichevan autonomy of Azerbaijan. That is what the Secretary 
of State on the Elchibey Administration, Ali Kerimov, has told 
Interfax. Kelekiy is the home village of ousted President 
Elchibey. 
  In Kerimov's view, government forces are attempting to 
disarm 
the Ordubad garrison which is loyal to Abulfaz Elchibey. 
  The local authorities, with their heavy representation of 
the 
opposition Popular Front, have sent protests to Baku and 
Nakhichevan. 
  Ali Kerimov holds the Baku Administration led by President 
Aliyev responsible for the negative developments in Ordubad. 
  The press center of Azerbaijan's Ministry of Internal 
Affairs 
says, however, it has had no information on developments around 
Elchibey's home village.

  [Text] The building of the Baku-based headquarters of 
Azerbaijan's Popular Front (APF) has been under police control 
for the 13th day already, a source in the APF apparatus reported 
to Interfax. 
  Azerbaijan's law-enforcement bodies blocked the building 
after they found ammunitions and uniforms in the building's 
basement. The APF leadership declared that part of the building 
is occupied by the apparatus of the executive power of Baku's 
Sabaylskiy Region and announced that they have nothing to do 
with the discovered objects. 
  The APF representative declared that after the Front was 
removed from power last summer, the headquarters has remained 
under actual supervision of the police and was repeatedly 
subjected to searches. 
  The source expressed fear that the authorities would take 
the 
APF building situated in the center of Baku. He reported that 
the APF signboard was removed from the building on March 9. 
  Azerbaijan's ex-president Abulfaz Elchibey who is hiding in 
his native village of Keleki in the Nakhichevan autonomous 
republic now is chairman of the Front. 
  Interfax interlocutor also underlined that normal work of 
the 
Front has been paralyzed due to the fact that the headquarters 
building remains under police control. He reminded that the 
last sitting of the APF majlis was held under illegal conditions. 
  The Majlis of Azerbaijan's Popular Front made a decision to 
abstain from mass actions of protest despite the authorities' 
attempts to draw the Front into confrontation.

  Mr. Shevardnadze and Mr. Perry spoke of the first steps in 
the cooperation, namely, the sending of the first U.S. military 
attache to Georgia, a draft international program of instructing 
and training Georgian military specialists, an interest taken by 
Georgia in a program "For well-being and partnership" suggested

  The sides reached an agreement on having a Georgian military 
attache sent to Washington.

Defense delegation, which would include senior officials of the 
department, to Georgia in May. The delegation will discuss

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Setunskiy] </F>
  [Text] Ottawa, 11 Mar -- Talks between Canadian Prime 
Minister Jean Chretien and Georgian head of state Eduard 
Shevardnadze, who paid a one-day working visit to Canada, ended 
in the Canadian capital on Thursday evening with the signing of 
a Canadian-Georgian declaration of friendship and cooperation. 
  The talks, which were attended by Canadian External Affairs 
Minister Andre Ouellet and Georgian Foreign Minister Aleksandr 
Chikvaidze, centered on the situation in Georgia, the UN's 
possible role in settling it, Canada's assistance, and also 
questions of Canadian-Georgian relations. 
  "We realize perfectly well that the situation in Georgia is 
an extremely difficult one, and we would like to help it, 
particularly with supplies of Canadian wheat, and also technical 
assistance," Jean Chretien said at a meeting with journalists at 
the end of the talks. In a brief response, Eduard Shevardnadze 
expressed gratitude to Canada for its understanding of Georgia's 
problems and for its expression of solidarity with it. He noted 
that the signed declaration is a good basis for the further 
development of relations between the two countries. 
  Canadian External Affairs Minister Andre Ouellet, in an 
interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, said: "We discussed 
the situation in Georgia in the context of the task to achieve 
peace in that region. He (Shevardnadze) asked Canada for 
support in setting up the UN peacekeeping forces. The prime 
minister made it clear that he would give such support and would 
inform the United Nstions that the implementation of the peace 
mission is an urgent task. The prime minister made it clear 
that because of the very important commitments we have 
undertaken at this time in Bosnia and Croatia, it would be 
difficult for us to send troops (to Georgia), but the prime 
minister expressed a readiness to do so if the United Nstions 
requests that a certain number of technical and military 
advisors, which could become an inalienable part of the 
peacekeeping mission, should be sent." 
  At the conclusion of the visit, Eduard Shevardnadze was 
received by Canadian Governor-General Ramon Hnatyshyn, after 
which he left Ottawa for home.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 11 Mar -- An IBERIA news agency 
correspondent has been told by Boris Kakubava, member of the 
Georgian parliament, that the Abkhazian Liberation Union has 
drafted a plan to return to Abkhazia: "We will soon be in 
Abkhazia, in our territory, in our homes. We will wipe away 
everyone who stands in our way, no matter who they are -- 
Russian troops or those of the Georgian authorities," Boris 
Kakubava said.

  [Text] The Abkhazi Parliament's Spokesman Beslan Barganjia 
has declared that the Georgian Parliament's decision to dissolve 
Abkhazia's Supreme Soviet "is a provocative attempt to 
destabilize the situation in the republic." 
  In an interview with Interfax on Friday, he declined to 
comment on the legal aspects of Tbilisi's decision but stressed 
that "it is for the people of Abkhazia rather than for the 
parliament of Georgia -- an aggressor country -- to decide on 
Abkhazia's future." 
  Meanwhile, the Abkhazi lawmaker Yuriy Voronov has remarked 
in 
an interview with Interfax: "Georgia's parliament could just as 
well dismiss U.S. Congress or Russian parliament." 
  The Abkhazi legislator Lev Damenia, for his part, argues 
that 
"the Georgian parliament's resolution reaffirms that republic's 
further reliance on force as a means to resolve the Abkhazi 
issue." 
  Yet another Abkhazi lawmaker Vladimir Zantaria has suggested 
that "the decision was undoubtedly prompted by Georgia's desire 
to set up an international administration in Abkhazia, but that 
would be occupation already." 
  Abkhazia's First Deputy Premier, lawmaker Leonid Lakerbaya, 
has declared that "any decision to deploy peace-keepers in 
Abkhazia would be possible only within the framework of the 
Geneva accords. The decision testifies to Georgia's rejection of 
constructive political dialogue," he said. 
  An Interfax correspondent polled 53 Sukhumi residents on 
Friday. All respondents declared that the decision was illegal. 
85 percent of them regard it as a step toward renewed fighting.

  [Text] Sochi March 11 TASS -- The Supreme Soviet 
(parliament) of Georgia's breakaway province of Abkhazia said on 
Friday it would not obey the Georgian Parliament's ruling 
disbanding the Abkhazian supreme legislature. 
  The Abkhazian Information and Press Ministry released today 
a 
statement by the separatist parliament stressing that the 
decision by Georgian lawmakers proved to their ignoring legal 
norms. "The existing constitutions of Georgia and of Abkhazia 
do not provide for dissolution of Abkhazia's supreme legislature 
by the Georgian Parliament", the statement said. "By taking 
this decision, lawmakers probably sought to disrupt negotiations 
for a peaceful settlement in Abkhazia", it noted. 
  The Abkhazian Parliament reiterated its commitment to a 
peaceful settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. It 
claimed that the decisions passed by the Georgian legislature 
had nothing to do with the Republic of Abkhazia and only led to 
spiralling tensions in Georgian-Abkhazian relations.

  [Text] Tbilisi 11 [date as received] -- According to 
information received by the IBERIA news agency, the Governing 
Council of the People's Front of Georgia has made the following 
statement: 
  "On 1 March 1994, the Georgian Supreme Council ratified 
Georgia's joining the CIS, thus actually making an attempt to 
legalize the loss of Georgia's statehood and Georgia's 
incorporation into a modernized empire. The People's Front 
Governing Council considers this contradicts the law due to the 
following: 
  1. The act on the restoration of Georgian state independence 
adopted unanimously by the legally elected Georgian Supreme 
Council on 9 April 1991 was based on a nationwide referendum 
held on 31 March 1991, during which 98 percent of the population 
of Georgia voted for Georgia's independence. It is unlawful to 
make decisions on a complete or partial cancellation 
(limitation) [agency parentheses] of Georgia's independence by 
the way other than a referendum; 
  2. Georgia's joining the CIS contradicts the law of the 
Republic of Georgia on defense that recognizes Georgia's active 
neutrality and nonalignment with military blocs; 
  3. More than a half of the total number of members of the 
Supreme Council voted for Georgia's joining the CIS. However, 
such a decision can only be taken by a qualified majority.

  [Text] The Kuchma-Grinyov Inter-Regional Bloc of Reforms, 
led by Ukraine's Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma and Vice Chairman 
of the Ukrainian parliament Vladimir Grinyov, circulated an 
appeal to the Ukrainian people on March 12 in view of the 
parliamentary elections scheduled for March 27. 
  This document says that "the country has approached the 
limit 
beyond which there is national catastrophe, economic ruin and 
civil war." It also says that Ukraine needed a new political 
course and successful democratic elections. 
  The Inter-Regional Bloc of Reforms urged the population not 
to allow the bankrupt authorities, who are planning to foil the 
elections, to deceive them. If the Ukrainian citizens do not 
come to the polling stations on March 27, the policy which has 
pushed them to the verge of extinction, will be continued, says 
this bloc's appeal.

  [Text] Simferopol March 11 TASS -- The Crimean Parliament 
nominated ex-Russian Economic Minister and economist Yevgeniy 
Saburov Crimean vice-premier today on proposal of Crimean 
President Yuriy Meshkov and decided to appeal to the Ukrainian 
president for Ukrainian citizenship of Saburov. 
  Saburov thinks a program of economic reforms can be 
developed 
in the near future to ensure the improvement of financial 
relations with Russia, better banking and privatization system, 
changes in the taxation system and attraction of foreign 
investors. 
  The Russian economist praised the current Crimean Government 
and said only a few new people will be introduced in the Crimean 
cabinet. 
  The parliament meeting put on the agenda the cancellation of 
moratorium on referendum on the Crimean state status and refused 
to consider the application of Parliament Speaker Nikolay Bagrov 
for resignation. 
  The parliament made no comments on the Ukrainian Parliament 
resolution on bringing the Crimean legislation in correspondence 
to the Ukrainian laws and voted down the proposal to restore the 
Crimean Constitution of May 6, 1992, that declared independence 
of the Crimea. 
  The law-makers listened to ministers' reports on draft plans 
of Crimean economic and social development, republican and local 
budgets for 1994 and discussed the documents in commissions.

  [Text] Simferopol, 11 March -- While Crimean MP's were 
approving Crimea's budget, Yevgeniy Saburov, who was appointed 
deputy premier of its government, held his first official press 
conference. 
  He stated that the new government of the republic would 
begin 
to operate in its final form in a month's time -- in April. 
  Yevgeniy Saburov said that the break with Russia was rather 
tragic for the economy of the Crimea since it was oriented 
toward selling goods and services to the Russian north in the 
first instance. Therefore, if one were to speak of restoring 
these contacts, what was at issue was not political 
rapprochement but the closest ties with the sales market. This 
is what the people of Crimea wanted, too, and one should be 
sympathetic toward the will of the people. 
  He confirmed that Crimea and Ukraine would enjoy the closest 
ties. And it was likely that the best of what was accepted in 
the Crimea would be used in Ukraine, too. 
  In reply to a question as to what would happen if 
politicians 
did not allow the reforms to be carried out, the deputy premier 
said that in that event, his stay in the Crimea would be 
pointless. 
  At the press conference itself, Yevgeniy Saburov signed a 
statement to Leonid Kravchuk, president of Ukraine, asking 
Ukrainian citizenship to be conferred upon him in connection 
with his appointment to work in the Crimean government.

  [Text] Simferopol, 12 Mar -- The chairman of the Crimean 
Supreme Council held a news conference on the results of its 
15th session. He said that the session had fulfilled its task, 
despite the fact that the deputies did not cover all the issues 
on the agenda. In his opinion, "the approval of the 
socioeconomic development plan and the budget of the Republic of 
Crimea for this year, and the confirmation of the appointment of 
the new government's deputy prime minister set the necessary 
work environment for the new executive power." 
  The Supreme Council chairman believes, however, that this 
was 
the last session of Crimea's present Supreme Council. It will 
be impossible to convene a new session, he said, since the 
majority of parliamentarians are involved in the election 
campaign to keep their seats. Asked what political forces he 
thinks would win in the upcoming election, he said that 
candidates of the Rossiya bloc and the Communists stood the best 
chance of winning the biggest vote. "The Party of Economic 
Revival and the Union in Support of the Republic of Crimea are 
also likely to gain seats, but the new parliament will be a 
complex one." 
  Crimea's Supreme Council chairman reiterated his opinion on 
the priority of economic problems on the peninsula. He does not 
believe it sensible to hold the Crimea-wide poll on 27 March 
according to Yuriy Meshkov's decree, as it would have no legal 
force. As for the issue of lifting the moratorium on the 
referendum about Crimea's independence which is set to be 
examined at the next session, the Crimean Supreme Council 
chairman described it as yet another political gamble by those 
reluctant to leave their Supreme Council seats. "If the Crimean 
card continues to be played, if there is no peace and stability 
on the peninsula, then the investments so necessary to overcome 
the economic crisis will remain Yevhen Saburov's and his 
government's dream," Mykola Bahrov stressed. 
  Mykola Bahrov also declared his negative attitude to the 
resolution by Ukraine's Supreme Council obliging Crimea to bring 
its legislation in line with the Ukrainian laws within a month: 
In his opinion, this is not a realistic deadline. 
  Asked what he thought of Yuriy Meshkov's statement 
circulated 
in the media about the need to withdraw military formations from 
the territory of the autonomous republic, Mykola Bahrov said: 
"Be realistic. Crimea is Ukraine's border zone, therefore, its 
troops have to be deployed here."

  [Text] The idea of establishing alternative television in 
the Crimea has been voiced by [passage indistinct]. The 
Crimeans, Averkin noted, are currently offered a poor medium in 
Ukrainian state television, meaning the Crimean Broadcasting 
Company, which, in his opinion, protects the interests of 
Ukraine, rather than Crimea. The new broadcasting company -- 
says the chairman of the association Impact 55 that has a 
criminal record -- will serve the Crimean people and protect 
their interests. 
  Averkin suggests that the new broadcasting company be 
financed by the Crimean budget, all revenues of which now remain 
in Crimea. We will establish and finance our own broadcasting 
company, the businessmen-politician said, and later we will 
assess how Crimean television is doing. Averkin's idea, in the 
correspondent's opinion, will undoubtedly be backed by Crimean 
President Meshkov, who has asked Valeriy Astakhov, the current 
president of the Crimean Broadcasting Company, to resign. There 
are, however, no legal grounds for dismissing the latter or any 
other inconvenient radio and television journalists.

  [Text] The Italian foreign minister and chairman of the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, Professor 
Beniamino Andreatta, paid a one-day visit to Lithuania on 
Friday. Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius and the 
Italian foreign minister signed the first Lithuanian/Italian 
agreement on cooperation in the spheres of economy, production, 
and technology. The agreement is valid for a term of 10 years. 
The delegation led by the Italian foreign minister was received 
by President Algirdas Brazauskas. 
  At the meeting, Professor Benjamin Andreatta said that 
Western states expected Lithuania's contribution to easing 
tension between Russia and the Baltic states of Latvia and 
Estonia. As to the possibilities of Lithuania's integration 
into the European Union, the Italian minister said that if 
Lithuania maintained good relations with Russia it could expect 
Italy's support in seeking a free trade agreement with the 
European Union and an associated membership in that 
organization. Bilateral Lithuanian/Italian relations, as well 
as those with neighboring countries, were discussed in greater 
detail at a roundtable talk with members of the Lithuanian 
Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee and deputy foreign 
ministers. 
  Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta also had a 
meeting with Chairman of the Lithuanian Parliament, Ceslovas 
Jursenas.

  [Text] Vilnius, March 11, ELTA -- A Lithuanian-Danish 
agreement on military co-operation was signed on Friday [11 
March] which was evaluated by Lithuanian National defence 
minister Linas Linkevicius as one more step towards the 
structures of NATO. 
  The agreement was signed between Linkevicius and his Danish 
counterpart Hans Haekkerup who was on visit in the Baltic state. 
  With the help of Denmark which is a member of NATO, 
Lithuania 
is going to create and develop its armed forces and voluntary 
service of national defence, to train servicemen, to make up a 
peacekeeping corps. 
  Linkevicius said Denmark was participating most actively in 
forming units of "blue helmets". A company of Lithuanian 
soldiers has already been trained in Denmark, another one is due 
to leave in the nearest days. In August, Lithuanian 
peacekeeping contingent is going to go to Croatia together with 
Danish battalion. 
  No doubt, the agreement pushes Lithuania nearer to the 
Western Europe, Haekkerup said. Denmark is taking part in 
preparations of a programme introducing Lithuania to NATO, joint 
exercises of military units of both states are planned. Late in 
January, Lithuania became the second state after Romania to sign 
a NATO initiative "Partnership for peace". 
  In March 18, representatives of Scandinavia, Germany, 
Britain, the U.S. and the three Baltic states are going to meet 
in Copenhagen and consider assistance to Lithuania, Latvia and 
Estonia creating their own peacekeeping forces. A joint 
battalion of the three countries is planned to set up with its 
training centre in Lithuanian southern city Alytus, in a former 
military basis of Russian paratroopers.

<F P=106> [Interview with Rimvydas Mintautas, chairman of the </F>
Lithuanian Riflemen's Union, by Ona Mickeviciute; place and date 
not given: "The Lithuanian Riflemen's Union Would Like To Be 
Independent" -- questions published in boldface] 
  [Excerpts] [Mickeviciute]Recently, the press has 
reported extensively on the Volunteer National Defense Service 
[SKAT], while the Riflemen's Union has remained in the shadows. 
Are your modest activities or the evasion of publicity 
responsible for this? 
  [Mintautas] Yes, the press has devoted too little attention 
to us. I think this is because we are not a state-run 
organization, like the national defense system or SKAT. As any 
family, however, we also have some naughty children, but we do 
not have such problems as the military or volunteers. 
  [Mickeviciute] What are your union's relations with 
military and volunteer organizations? 
  [Mintautas] Our ties with the national defense system have 
never been ideal. They have been this way since the time when 
Mr. Butkevicius became head the National Defense Department. 
  The National Defense Ministry [KAM] has long been persuading 
us to join it. However, our principle is to be independent. 
True, I do not envision riflemen without firearms, and an armed 
organization should be subject to some structure. No government 
would like to have independent armed men. However, we do not 
want to engage only in marching and playing brass nicely. 
  Moreover, the national defense system has many people whom 
the riflemen do not trust. These are former high-ranking Soviet 
Army officers. We have met with them and we know what they are 
like. 
  Our cooperation with the SKAT is traditional and sincere, 
because the latter actually originated from the Riflemen's Union. 
  Having regained some of their prewar facilities, the 
riflemen 
are sharing them with SKAT and using its training bases. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Mickeviciute]What was your attitude toward the 
volunteer mutiny headed by Maskvytis in the woods near 
Kaunas? 
  [Mintautas] We did not make any statements during that 
mutiny. We thought later that we could have assumed a 
conciliatory function. 
  [Mickeviciute]The community thinks that the Riflemen's 
Union is in opposition to the elected government. Is this 
opinion grounded? If there is any confrontation, what are its 
reasons, and how can they be removed? 
  [Mintautas] I expected such a question. The members of our 
organization are really dissatisfied with the current Seimas 
[parliament] majority. This is natural, because most of us come 
from the other side of the barricades. The Riflemen's Union 
supported, supports, and will support Lithuania's right-wing 
forces. However, this should not evoke any dangerous 
confrontation. I have always claimed that the Lithuanian 
Government was not brought on tanks from Warsaw, Moscow, or 
Berlin, and we must get on with it. There are no reasons that 
should be removed. However, we are unlikely to have good 
contacts with the current authorities. 
  One cannot shout in a silly manner that everything is bad. 
For example, a good resolution allowing citizens to keep 
firearms has already been adopted, which is particularly 
important to us, the riflemen. [passage omitted] 
  [Mickeviciute]What problems do you have? 
  [Mintautas] We appealed to all our governments for some 
guarantees. Our members offered their services in guarding the 
Russian Army while it was here. We would like to contribute to 
the enforcement of public order, but the police do not want such 
support. They do not want to grant us even such powers as 
civilian militia supporters used to have. 
  The police do not forbid us from assisting them, but we 
ourselves will be responsible for the consequences. 
  We have knocked on many doors concerning these and other 
similar issues. We have received replies from the ministers of 
national defense and justice, saying that our request for arms 
and guarantees should make us subordinate to the KAM or the 
Interior Ministry. There have been suggestions to draft a new 
statute because the old one was registered by Mrs. K. Prunskiene 
[first prime minister of independent Lithuania]. The current 
draft statute was prepared very quickly, indicating that the 
Riflemen's Union operates under the KAM. It was presented back 
in December to Defense Minister L. Linkevicius, who replied that 
he would like to meet and talk with us. 
  After we draft the new statute, we will hold a congress and 
decide whether to remain with the KAM or remain independent. 
  We have received a proposal to become a police reserve, but 
this would mean the end of such organization as the Riflemen's 
Union.... Our people would not like this.... [passage omitted] 
  [Mickeviciute]Tell us briefly about the Lithuanian 
Riflemen's Union. What are the number and age of your members? 
What are your rules of admission? 
  [Mintautas] The union has about 7,000 members, including a 
small number of former professional USSR officers. We have 15 
divisions comprising 150 territorial units. We do not admit 
former communists to our union. We had not had such a principle 
before we adopted it at our first congress in 1990. Some of 
former Communist Party members became our members, took an oath 
of allegiance, and are now in the ranks of our union. Such was 
former SKAT chief Colonel J. Gecas. 
  The Riflemen's Union also operates among Lithuanian emigres, 
and we maintain good contacts with them. Actually we live on 
financial support from riflemen emigres. 
  Young people between 30 and 35, mostly workers, account for 
almost 40 percent of our members. We would also like to attract 
intellectuals to our ranks. 
  Women also belong to our organization, but their number in 
different divisions is uneven: Kaunas and Utena divisions have 
30 females each, while Vilnius -- only 10. 
  Our divisions are rather autonomous. Each division commander 
is a member of the union's Executive Council. 
  [Mickeviciute] What are your immediate plans? 
  [Mintautas] First of all, I will meet with the national 
defense minister. Many issues must be discussed and made clear. 
We do not intend to ask for a single cent from the KAM budget. 
I do not know why the press reported so. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Vilnius, March 11, ELTA -- Two thirds of all the 
crimes in Lithuania are committed by persons until 29 year-old 
and the majority of them are minors, Interior ministry told ELTA 
[sentence as received]. 
  Mostly, children without business commit crimes -- who do 
not 
attend school, have no parents or one of them, also children of 
unemployed people. 
  Major part of crimes are made in places attended by young 
people - hostels, cafes, discotheques, in cities of Vilnius and 
Klaipeda, regions of Kupiskis, Anyksciai, Moletai. Four fifths 
of youth crimes are thefts of property. The rest part is 
murders and rapes. 
  Age of criminals is diminishing. In 1990, the youngest 
criminals were of 12-13 years, in 1993 -- nine-year-olds. About 
a half crimes are committed by youngsters abusing various 
intoxicants.

  [Text] Yerevan, 13 Mar -- The heads of the Armenian and 
Azerbaijani parliaments did not sign any documents whatsoever 
during their meeting on Saturday, Babken Ararktsyan, the 
chairman of the Supreme Council of Armenia, has said. In an 
interview with ITAR-TASS he described as groundless today's 
reports that agreements were signed at the meeting. Such 
claims, he said, pursue purely propaganda motives, and 
Azerbaijan is passing off as fact its versions of a regional 
peace settlement. 
  Ararktsyan recalled that at the meeting various suggestions 
were made regarding a cease-fire and peace guarantees, which 
could be based on the CSCE's Vienna timetable, Russian 
proposals, and also other possibilities.

  [Text] Yerevan, 12 Mar -- On the border between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan, a meeting between Babken Ararksyan and Rasul 
Guliyev, the heads of parliaments of those two republics, began 
this afternoon. The first stage of the meeting is being held in 
Azerbaijan's Kazakhskiy Rayon, near the border. The meeting 
will subsequently be continued in Idzhevanskiy rayon in the 
northeast of Armenia. 
  The talks are taking place in camera, but it is known that 
the heads of the legislative bodies of Armenia and Azerbaijan 
are discussing the problem of settling the conflict in 
Nagorno-Karabakh -- specifically, ways of achieving a cease-fire 
in the region affected by the conflict.

headline] 
  [Text] Moscow, March 12 (SNARK) -- The declaration recently 
done by the Azerbaijani leader Geydar Aliyev could be considered 
a sensation, Felix Mamikonyan, an Armenian ambassador to Russia, 
told journalists at his press-conference. Geydar Aliyev said he 
is ready to consider the status of the Republic of 
Nagorno-Karabakh if only the Karabakh troops leave for their 
territory. 
  Thus, the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh is officially 
recognized a conflict side, though Azerbaijan was always 
avoiding doing it. But, according to Mamikonyan, the Aliyev's 
declaration gives no mechanism of conflict regulation. 
  Mr. Mamikonyan also confirmed Karabakh for numerous times 
declared he has a claim on the lands of Azeris and is ready to 
set them free as soon as the problem of Nagorno-Karabakh 
security is solved.

  [Text] Yerevan March 13 TASS -- Armenian and Azerbaijani 
parliament chiefs, Babken Ararktsyan and Rasul Guliyev, met at 
the Armenian-Azerbaijani border on Saturday to discuss matters 
connected with a peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
issue, a spokesman in the press centre of the Armenian 
Parliament told ITAR- TASS. 
  The two sides considered ways to resolve the Karabakh 
conflict in the light of Russia's mediatory initiative and the 
peacemaking mission of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe. 
  Araktsyan said the Armenian side, as a gesture of goodwill, 
stated its readiness to ensure the transit of all freight by 
rail across Armenian territory from Turkey to the Nakhichevan 
Autonomous Republic and the transmission of electric power for 
Nakhichevan through the Armenian power grid. 
  At the close of the meeting, the Armenian parliament chief 
said the Azerbaijani side is inclined to recognise 
Nagorno-Karabakh as a full-fledged participant in the talks. 
  The meeting was held in an atmosphere of mutual 
understanding 
and constructiveness, Guliyev pointed out. He agreed with his 
Armenian counterpart that the crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh can be 
resolved only politically, not militarily. 
  Bilateral consultations will be continued, the chiefs of two 
parliaments said, according to the spokesman.

  [Text] Yerevan, March 12. (SNARK) -- Most resultive in 
settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict may become the 
initiatives stemming from Russia and Iran, told SNARK today 
Larissa Allaverdyan, the head expert of Artsakh 
(Nagorno-Karabakh) Commission in Armenian parliament. In her 
opinion, these two states are not only participants of 
peacemaking processes, but also bear responsibility in the 
international-law aspect, in front of the world community, for 
resolution of Karabakh problem. 
  Russia and Iran, told the expert, are historically the last 
title-holders of Karabakh. Joint initiatives, should they stem 
form Russia and Iran, would have been in the interests of all 
world states, and not only of Transcaucasus population, said 
Larissa Allaverdyan.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 11 TASS -- "The Azeri side is fully 
responsible for the non-fulfilment of the protocol on 
termination of combat operations and troops withdrawal signed on 
February 18 in Moscow by the Armenian and Azeri defence 
ministers and the Karabakh military representative with 
participation of the Russian defence minister," Armenian 
permanent representative to Russia Felix Mamikonyan told a news 
conference here today. 
  Despite the fact the document was signed by all the sides, 
the Azeri side considered its fulfilment impossible and is 
making new terms. 
  In the opinion of Mamikonyan, Azerbaijan keeps to the force 
solution of the Karabakh conflict, which will claim more human 
lives. The representative linked recent foreign visits of 
Heydar Aliyev after signing of the Moscow protocol with an 
attempt to "distance from Russia". He refuted Azeri mass media 
reports claiming the protocol was signed under the pressure of 
Pavel Grachev and described the Russian stand in the Karabakh 
conflict as "restraint and well-balanced". 
  Asked by ITAR-TASS whether the Armenian side agrees to all 
items of the protocol, Mamikonyan said it is a compromise 
document but one shall fulfill it. He did not specify what 
items are meant referring to the confidential character of the 
protocol. 
  A day before Azeri Ambassador Plenipotentiary and 
Extraordinary to Russia Ramiz Rizayev told a news conference in 
Moscow about the Azeri stand on troops pullback at 15 
kilometers. In the opinion of the Azeri side, the initial 
pullback line should be the Karabakh administrative border 
instead of the line of the sides' contact. 
  Mamikonyan said in this case Azerbaijan will bring its 
troops 
to the Karabakh border and Karabakh populated localities will be 
in danger again due to the absence of the "security and 
confidence mechanism". 
  Speaking of the Armenian troops withdrawal from seized 
lands, 
whose temporary control was explained by the representative with 
military-strategic goals, Mamikonyan said this is impossible to 
be done without political settlement. "If it is so easy to do 
the Jews would have left the Golan Heights within a day", he 
said. 
  Armenia stands for the introduction of peace-makers into the 
conflict zone, however, it is more psychologically ready for the 
introduction of Russian peace-makers, said the representative. 
  Speaking of the upcoming meeting of the Armenian and Azeri 
presidents with the mediation of Boris Yeltsin, he said the 
meeting should be well-prepared, but its date has not been 
specified. 
  He confirmed that delegations of the Armenian and Azeri 
parliaments will meet on the border on Saturday.

  [Text] Yerevan, March 11 (SNARK)--Armenia is considered to 
be the most reformist out of all republics of the former USSR, 
declared today the World Bank representative in Armenia Vahram 
Nersesiants. 
  Answering SNARK correspondent's question on the appraisal of 
Armenian Government's concrete actions, Nersesiants noted that 
Armenia has successfully accomplished land privatization. 
"Other countries need 20-30 years of persuasions to make such a 
step", stressed he. 
  In Nersesiants's view, housing privatization and open trade 
also provide favorable image for Armenia. However, the reforms 
in financial system are being postponed. "Yet, strategic course 
of Armenian economy's development is appraised by the World Bank 
highly enough", said Vahram Nersesiants.

  [Text] Yerevan, March 11 (SNARK)--Armenia could get 3 and 
even 4 times more credits from the World Bank, but for the 
Karabakh military conflict, Vahram Nersesiants, the 
representative of the bank in Armenia, said today. At the 
press-conference in the Yerevan he said that the last year the 
World Bank gave Armenia 12 million US dollars, and this 
February, under very profitable conditions, gave a credit of 28 
million US dollars for liquidation consequences of the 
earthquake in 1988. He said that the World Bank probably will 
give 40 million US dollars for agriculture. It is also expected 
the World Bank will give credits for development of the 
energetics and fulfillment of the social programs.

  [Text] Prime Minister Mart Laar told the BALTIC NEWS 
SERVICE [BNS] that the next round of Estonian-Russian talks is 
scheduled for the beginning of April in Moscow. Russia has 
proposed to continue the interstate talks and evidently Estonia 
will accept this proposal, the Prime Minister said. Taking into 
account the latest statements from top Russian officials there 
is reason to sit down around a talks table again. If Russia 
also gives up the additional conditions set for the withdrawal 
of troops there is hope that quick progress will be made 
regarding agreements, Laar claimed to BNS. 
  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on 11 March 
on his visit to Finland that Russia will withdraw its troops 
from Latvia and Estonia by the agreed deadline, 31 August 1994. 
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, too, has gone back on 
his previous statements and stated in Germany that Russia will 
honor the 31 August deadline for the troop withdrawal. Russia 
had previously stated that it does not view the troop withdrawal 
date as binding. Russian representatives have also claimed that 
they will take time out at Estonian-Russian talks. 
  Mart Laar sees Chernomyrdin's and Grachev's latest 
statements 
as positive. According to the [Estonian] prime minister, 
Estonia does not intend to make any changes in the delegation 
and will continue with the existing team. At the same time Mart 
Laar is convinced, as before, that it is necessary for the 
Estonian and Russian top officials to meet.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 11, BNS -- The problems that cropped 
up in the course of the Russian-Estonian negotiations must be 
ironed out on a higher level than that of government 
delegations, Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar said today in an 
interview to BNS. 
  Laar emphasized that the talks between the two countries 
"have come to a deadlock" and "an impetus on a higher level than 
that of experts" is needed to break the deadlock. 
  "Lately Russia has shown no wish to withdraw its troops from 
our country," the Estonian premier said. "We confront a 
political problem which will have to be solved by the top 
leaders of both countries." 
  Laar voiced his hope that a meeting between the premiers or 
foreign ministers of the two countries will eventually take 
place, but he didn't consider it likely that the Estonian and 
the Russian presidents would meet any time soon. 
  The Estonian-Russian negotiations reached an impasse after 
Russia announced at the 17th round of talks at the beginning of 
March that it may reconsider the final deadline for the troop 
withdrawal and linked the pullout to the signing of an agreement 
on "social guarantees" for retired Russian military and a 
number of other issues. Estonia then declared it may break off 
the talks. The parties did not set the date for the next round 
of negotiations. 
  The Estonian Government proposed on March 4 that 
consultations on a higher level be held. 
  Laar stressed in the interview to BNS that "the ball is now 
in Russia's court" and that "Russia must show how serious its 
intentions are." 
  Meanwhile, Aleksandr Udaltsov, a high-ranking official at 
the 
Russian Foreign Ministry, in an interview to BNS on Wednesday [9 
March] expressed doubt about the need to raise the level of 
negotiations, saying the government delegations of the two 
countries "haven't yet exhausted their potential." 
  Udaltsov proceeded to say that the two parties "don't see 
eye 
to eye in questions of principle, and consultations would only 
make sense if there were a sign of some give and take, but 
Russia has seen no such signs so far." The Russian diplomat 
voiced his opinion that "there's no point in meeting for the 
sake of meeting." 
  Laar regarded Udaltsov's statements as an indication that 
Russia's approach to talks with Estonia "isn't serious enough."

  [Text] Beniamino Andreatta, Minister of Foreign Affairs of 
Italy, which holds CSCE presidency at present, told a press 
conference on Friday [11 March], that at his talks with Estonian 
leaders during his two-day visit to Estonia he discussed mainly 
the problems of minorities living in Estonia. 
  Andreatta said that the CSCE does not reproach Estonia as 
far 
as legislature regulating the problems of minorities living in 
Estonia is concerned, the application of this legislation is 
what causes problems. He stated that we should not as much talk 
of nationalities as of citizenship and expressed his opinion 
that all aliens living in Estonia should have a right to a 
residence permit and foreigners' passport. 
  Andreatta had also a meeting with Estonian President Lennart 
Meri last night where he said that the CSCE activities will in 
the future, as at present, be directed towards finding 
constructive solutions to problems of Estonian-Russian 
relations. Italy as a EU member state was interested in 
economic and political cooperation with Estonia, he added.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 11, BNS -- The government ruled at its 
session yesterday to reduce as of today the transmission of 
Russian television company Ostankino's programs in Estonia. 
  The ruling is in effect from March 11 till 27. If the 
Ostankino company hasn't renegotiated its contract with Estonian 
Telecommunications or paid its debts by March 28, transmission 
of its programs will stop altogether. 
  Ostankino owes Estonian Telecommunications about 105,000 
Deutsche marks for 1993 and another 80,000 marks for January 
transmissions. 
  Under the contract concluded between the Ostankino 
television 
company and Estonian Telecommunications, Ostankino itself pays 
for the transmission of its programs in Estonia.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 11, BNS -- Pyotr Rozhok, the Russian 
Liberal Democratic Party's representative in Estonia, was 
yesterday questioned by the Estonian Security Police. 
  Rozhok, who holds Russian citizenship, was accompanied by 
Russian Deputy Consul Valeri Chalovsky. 
  Rozhok told BNS that "nothing came of the talk with the 
police," since he demanded the services of a Moscow lawyer. The 
interrogation was attended by an Estonian lawyer, an 
interpreter, and Chalovsky. 
  The Security Police summoned Rozhok for another session of 
questioning on March 16. 
  Estonian authorities started on Feb. 4 investigating Rozhok 
under Article 72 of the Estonian Criminal Code for "inciting 
racial, national or religious hatred." If convicted, Rozhok 
faces a fine or up to a year in prison. 
  Rozhok stated he will not have an Estonian lawyer and that 
he 
doesn't intend to pay for any lawyer's services. In an 
interview with BNS, he said in justification of his refusal, 
"You made the mess, you clear it up." 
  Holger Siigart, deputy director of the Security Police, told 
BNS investigation of Rozhok's case continues and that Rozhok is 
in any case obliged to turn up for questioning. Siigart said 
the problem of the lawyer will somehow be solved, but wouldn't 
say how exactly.

  [Text] Estonia's Foreign Ministry will not consider the 
request of the Russian National Unity movement to free its 
compatriot Aleksandr Denisov, press secretary of the republic's 
Foreign Ministry Mari-Ann Rikken declared to Interfax on Friday. 
  As was reported earlier, Alexander Denisov was detained by 
Estonia's security police in the city of Johvi due to 
unauthorized possession of weapons and staying on Estonia's 
territory without appropriate documentation. On Friday leaders 
of the organization Russian National Unity appealed to the 
Estonian Embassy in Moscow to free Denisov and send him to 
Russia. Mari-Ann Rikken pointed out that as the question 
concerns a criminal case, the request had been handed over to 
the Interior Ministry. 
  Siigart Holger, deputy general director of the security 
police, reported that during the interrogation Denisov, who 
formerly lived in Estonia, declared that he fled from Russia 
because he was afraid of persecution for participation in the 
events of October 3-4 in Moscow. Estonia views Denisov as a 
criminal and a trial is now being prepared, said Siigart Holger.

  [Text] Moscow, Mar 11, BNS -- An ultranationalist Russian 
movement, Russia's National Unity, today petitioned the Estonian 
Embassy in Moscow for immediate release of Alexander Denisov, 
one of the movement's leaders. The petition also asked that 
Denisov be allowed to leave Estonia unhindered. 
  "The relations between the Estonian Government and the 
Russian nation in the near future depend on how Denisov's 
question is solved," Alexander Roshchitsky, the organization's 
spokesman, claimed. 
  Russia's National Unity maintains that the organization has 
a 
fellow feeling for Estonians and wants to develop friendly 
relations with this nation. 
  The organization claims the Russian people know Denisov as a 
"defender of the White House and of the Constitution" and regard 
him as a "national hero." 
  Denisov was detained on Feb. 15 in the northeast Estonian 
town of Johvi. He worked in the early 1980's in the 
Kohtla-Jarve police forces. In recent years Denisov fought for 
the so-called Transdniester Republic in Moldova and was one of 
former Russian parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov's 
bodyguards. 
  Denisov arrived in Estonia illegally late in November. 
Estonian authorities so far have charged him only with illegal 
possession of firearms. 
  Russia's National Unity has often been named a fascist 
organization. It is led by Alexander Barkashov, and members of 
the organization's shock troops are known as "barkashovtsy". In 
October 1993 "barkashovtsy", whose emblem closely resembles the 
swastika, defended the White House in Moscow side by side with 
the hardliners.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 11, BNS -- The first sample cartridges 
that conform to NATO standards are expected to come off the line 
at an Estonian factory next week, reliable sources informed BNS. 
  Defense Ministry press secretary Maige Proom neither 
confirmed nor denied the information. 
  The Defense Ministry and the Defense Forces general staff 
have for months held talks with several enterprises that are 
prepared to manufacture NATO standard 5.56 mm, 9 mm and 7.62 mm 
ammunition. 
  At least two Estonian companies, the Turi-based Arbalett 
joint-stock company, one of whose shareholders is the Defense 
League Foundation, and the Tartu-based state-owned Tarkon, have 
applied to the Defense Ministry to start production of 
cartridges. 
  Tarkon's director Toomas Noorem said in an earlier interview 
with BNS that his company is fully capable of and interested in 
producing cartridges. 
  Defense Minister Indrek Kannik was scheduled to visit the 
Tarkon plant today. 
  Defense Ministry Deputy Chancellor Tarmo Molder claimed in 
an 
interview with BNS that locally made cartridges would in any 
case be cheaper than, for example, ammunition imported from 
Israel. 
  Lieutenant Colonel Romas Zibas, head of the Lithuanian 
Defense Forces general staff's military training department, 
told BNS a couple of weeks ago that Lithuania is already 
producing its own cartridges and grenades. He said his country 
also plans in the near future to start manufacturing 60 mm and 
80 mm mortars and shells. The Latvian Defense Ministry invited 
bids from domestic manufacturers to start producing ammunition 
locally.

  [Text] Estonian residents who have been exposed to 
radiation and representatives of the Estonian National Rescue 
Board passed a decision to unite at a meeting of the Estonian 
Chernobyl Committee on Thursday [10 March]. 
  The committee unites people who were sent to clean up the 
areas polluted by the catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear power 
station in Ukraine in 1986 when Estonia was still part of the 
Soviet Union. 
  The meeting stated that noone could be sent to dangerous 
areas without guarantees with a specific reference to nuclear 
training reactors at former Soviet submarine training base, 
Paldiski, in northwest Estonia that will be dismantled soon. 
  Victims of Chernobyl lack social guarantees in Estonia as 
tax 
reductions were abolished by the new Income Tax Law and new 
reductions have not been drafted, the meeting stated. 
  Radiation victims in Estonia also include people who have 
been to nuclear sites on Novaya Zemlya and other places and also 
members of the Rescue Board.

<F P=106> [TURKMEN PRESS report: "The Manat Will Not Let You Down"] </F>
  [Text] Turkmen President S. Turkmenbashi [Niyazov] has 
given an interview to journalists from Turkmenistan National 
Television. Regarding certain difficulties connected with the 
transition period, the head of state advised working people and 
the country's entire population not to be taken in by idle 
chatterers and people who try to make these problems out to be 
large and intractable. Saparmurat Turkmenbashi appealed to his 
countrymen not to trust the widespread rumors about the Turkmen 
manat, to maintain their restraint and keep calm. Certain 
shortages in the supply of food and other goods to the 
population, the president noted, are mainly attributable to the 
fact that a number of states have paid their debts to 
Turkmenistan at an inconvenient time.

  [Text] Emomali Rakhmanov, head of the Tajik state, has 
described the murder of Mayonsho Nazarshoyev, the deputy 
chairman of Tajikistan's Council of Ministers, as a planned 
political act. He said this today at a mourning ceremony of 
farewell that took place outside the national parliament 
building. The Tajik leader stressed that, by this terrorist 
act, committed on the night of 10-11 March, certain extremist 
forces had reckoned on causing fear and confusion among the 
people of the republic, and on frustrating the peace efforts of 
the country's leadership to attain civil peace and national 
reconciliation. But they miscalculated, Emomali Rakhmanov 
declared. 
  Meanwhile, ITAR-TASS reported, citing trustworthy sources, 
two persons have been arrested on suspicion of the murder of the 
deputy prime minister of Tajikistan.

  [Text] Dushanbe March 11 TASS -- The procurator's office of 
Tajikistan on Friday [11 Friday] circulated a statement about 
the atrocious assassination of the republic's vice-premier 
Mayonsho Nazarshoyev. 
  The statement points out that the assassination was 
"committed in the Tajik capital by two members of an anti-state 
criminal gang headed by Mullo Kasym". 
  The assassins fled from the scene of the crime. On their way 
they stopped an oncoming VAZ-469 car being driven by a 
policeman. The criminals seized the policeman's gun and 
inflicted gunshot wounds on him. Later on the criminals 
attacked a food-laden truck, brutally beat its driver and rode 
the vehicle in the direction of Semiganch village of Kofarnikhon 
District. 
  The law enforcement agencies of Tajikistan brought it to the 
notice of the general public that Said Abdullah Nuri, leader of 
a self-proclaimed "government-in-exile", who is now in 
Afghanistan, had urged individual groups, who avoid prosecution 
for particularly grave crimes against their state to put 
vigorous pressure on the Tajik Government in order to 
destabilise the socio-political situation in the republic and 
fan up ethnic strife by using measures of intimidation, terror 
and physical removal of persons unwelcome to the opposition, 
particulary democratic-minded people and to work out plans for 
armed actions and other acts of sabotage. 
  The Tajikistan prosecutor-general's office has instituted 
criminal proceedings against the assassins of the vice-premier. 
A manhunt for the assassins was launched.

Kharchenko] 
  [Text] Dushanbe, 12 Mar -- Two people were detained on 
suspicion of murdering Deputy Prime Minister Mayonsho 
Nazarshoyev on Thursday [11 March] evening. An ITAR-TASS 
correspondent learned this today from reliable sources in the 
republic's law enforcement bodies. At the same time, 
[spokesmen] at the republic's Ministries of Internal Affairs and 
Security would neither confirm or deny this fact, confining 
themselves to saying that a search operation was underway and 
any information on the subject could not be disclosed for the 
time being. 
  At the same time, a highly-placed official from one of the 
power ministries was highly skeptical of the statement 
distributed to the mass media by the press center of the 
republic's procuracy general yesterday on the direct involvement 
in the act of terrorism of the antigovernment group of Mullo 
Kasym, in hiding in Kofirnikhonskiy rayon, a Dushanbe city 
suburb. This is only one of the many versions being worked on 
together with the other law enforcement bodies of the republic, 
he said. However, according to the source, experienced 
professionals have been called in in the search operation and 
one can rest assured that the real criminals will be found 
shortly.

  A statement of the Tajik opposition leaders voiced their 
"complete non-involvement" in the crime and said "Nazarshoyev 
was expected to head the Dushanbe Government delegation at 
negotiations with the opposition on March 16". 
  The murder "is beneficial only to numerous mafia-criminal 
structures", says the statement. "We need negotiations. They 
will enable our supporters to return home, to Tajikistan. 
Negotiations is peace," notes the document.

  [Text] Moscow March 11 TASS -- "The president, the Federal 
Assembly and the Government must clearly outline their 
commitments in a memorandum on civil peace. We would not like 
it to turn into a mere declaration," said Mikhail Poltoranin, 
chairman of the Duma Committee for Informational Politics, 
during debates on legislative activities held in the lower house 
of the Russian Parliament. 
  Poltoranin cautioned lawmakers against including into the 
memorandum the notion of "confronting forces". Poltoranin 
described today's Russia as "a raft swiftly carried away by the 
stream to a huge waterfall." "We most row together in order to 
reach a safe spot," he said. 
  He believes that the president and the Government must offer 
anti-crisis measures which would be adopted by all, parliament 
included. For its part, the State Duma must adopt a package of 
legislative acts which would ensure full implementation of these 
measures, he added. 
  Poltoranin believes that definite guarantees must be given 
both by the judicial power and public organisations, including 
trade unions, which "should not shake Russia with strikes," as 
he put it. Poltoranin urged journalists to undertake commitments 
to objectively cover the activities of all branches of power and 
processes which take place in Russia.

  [Text] Speaker of the Lower House of Russian Parliament, or 
the Duma, Ivan Rybkin, has called for unity among all political 
forces and power structures in their efforts to strengthen the 
Russian state. Rybkin was speaking Friday at a plenary sitting 
the Duma held to discuss President Yeltsin's address to 
parliament. 
  In Rybkin's view, Yeltsin had summed up the results of two 
years of destruction, rash moves and sacrifice and by his words 
proved he had come to realize it was about time for Russia to 
stop seeking foreign advice and live, instead, in conformity 
with its national characteristics, relying on its own forces. 
  Ivan Rybkin suggested that the lawmakers uphold Yeltsin's 
call for increased political responsibility for civic peace in 
Russia and that they sign an appropriate formal declaration to 
confirm this at the upcoming All-Russian Congress of Political 
Parties and Movements. 
  To make the Duma's legislative moves more effective, Ivan 
Rybkin suggested changes in the legislative procedures. He said 
a number of parliamentary factions, including the Liberal 
Democrats, felt each and all of the Duma's committees must be 
turned into a kind of micro-parliament whose job it would be to 
discuss and coordinate, with the factions, all amendments to 
existing legislation. The Duma would then meet in plenary 
sittings only to vote but not to discuss new bills. 
  In the speaker's view, what the factions were calling for, 
would, in fact, speed up the lawmaking process. And, Rybkin 
felt, work on concrete bills would divert the lawmakers' 
attention from purely political matters.

  [Text] The Chairman of the Duma's Security Committee Viktor 
Ilyukhin feels plans to transform the former Security Ministry 
into a Federal Counterintelligence Service are detrimental to 
both the security service and national security as such. 
Ilyukhin explained this view in a letter to Secretary Oleg 
Lobov of the National Security Council. 
  According to Ilyukhin, the decision to transform the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service from a government body into an 
agency under the direct supervision of President Yeltsin, 
contradicts the state Constitution. It takes the service, as 
well as the president's personal protection troops, out of the 
prosecutor's reach and makes it uncontrollable from the point of 
view of court and other authorities; and this, says Ilyukhin, 
may do great damage to the nation, as it already did in the 30s. 
  On the other hand, the division of what used to be the 
service's closely-knit system of regional administrations and 
the move to curtail the administrations' legal rights will 
reduce the service's effectiveness and hinder efforts to protect 
the Russian interests now that special services of other 
countries have stepped up action both along the whole length of 
the Russian borders and inside this country, believes Ilyukhin. 
  Ilyukhin opposes the decision to deprive the service of the 
right to conduct legal inquiries and have investigation cells. 
That decision is sure to make the service helpless and 
incapable of exposing spies and turncoats, he believes. 
  Ilyukhin says that until very recently the security services 
and the Ministry of Internal Affairs had been balancing or 
counterweighing each other's efforts. 
  Now, says the chairman of the Duma's Security Committee, 
moves have been made to upset that balance. The excessive 
authority buildup on the part of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs as well as the repeated moves to increase the numerical 
strength of the internal troops and riot police units with the 
adoption, by these, of weapons under army tables of 
organization, creates dangerous preconditions for the emergence 
of a powerful monster capable of defying the mechanisms of 
government control and carrying out any kind of anti- 
constitutional action. Unfortunately, something of the kind 
already happened in Russia. 
  Ilyukhin hopes the Secretary of the National Security 
Council 
understands the problem and will take, together with the 
parliamentary committee, appropriate concrete actions.

  [Text] Speaking on national television Thursday night, 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev declared that the elections in 
Kazakhstan on March 7 were democratic. 
  He said that since the deputies were elected from all 
population groups they expressed today's public opinion. He 
reiterated his readiness to actively work with the new 
parliament for the benefit of Kazakhstan and its multinational 
populace. He noted that the elections mirrored democracy in 
Kazakhstan today. "We have not come up to European standards 
yet, we are on our way to reaching them." 
  He reported that most CSCE observers, including those from 
France, Poland, Romania, Russia, and Central Asia, had described 
the voting in Kazakhstan as very democratic. He noted that only 
some of the CSCE monitors had held "a news conference unknown to 
us" without waiting for the election outcome. They alleged at 
the news conference that many irregularities had gone on record 
at the polls. Such conclusions, in Nazarbayev's opinion, were 
improper. 
  He reported that 37 parties and movements had taken part in 
the parliamentary elections in Kazakhstan. Representatives of 
12 nationalities were chosen. 
  On the so-called state list of candidates, criticized by 
international observers most of all, the president remarked that 
the nominees had been selected on an alternative basis. In his 
words, the state list featured scientists, lawyers, economists, 
representatives of different nations and ethnic groups, women, 
and members of various parties and movements.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of </F>
Kazakhstan, by Otto Latsis, in Almaty, date not given: 
"Nursultan Nazarbayev: There Is no Union, All Are Free but 
They Have no Option but To Resolve Everything Together"] 
  [Text] [Latsis] Nursultan Abishevich, you are constantly 
putting forward proposals on the development of bilateral 
relations between Kazakhstan and Russia and multilateral 
relations within the CIS framework. Behind your initiative one 
senses a certain notion of the nature of and prospects for our 
mutual relations. We are going through a time of agonizing 
transformation after the collapse of the USSR, the state form in 
which our unity used to be expressed. The old, imperial form 
could not exist any longer. But what exists on the territory of 
the former USSR is essentially a single economy, an aggregate of 
common geopolitical interests, and most importantly, a human 
unity, an aggregate of personal ties, a community of culture, 
and a community of historical destiny. To realize this unity, 
which is an objective fact, it is necessary to elaborate a new 
system of state relations or, nowadays, interstate relations. 
What do you think about that? 
  [Nazarbayev] The situation in the CIS and in Russia itself 
now is such that no politician can entirely predict what is 
going to happen tomorrow. Concrete ideas change but it is 
possible to show what we are constantly striving towards. I 
would like to return to the time when it was still possible to 
do everything differently, back to 1990. During the routine 
Congress of USSR People's Deputies the leaders of Russia, 
Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan met at my residence in Moscow. 
By the end of 1990 it was obvious that the ship of state was 
moving without a rudder or a sail. We wanted to try to save the 
unity with states which felt the same way. At that time only 
four states were ready to create a new union on the basis of 
sovereignty. The corresponding document was drawn up and we all 
signed it. Russia was represented by Boris Nikolayevich 
Yeltsin. We could see that the Baltic region was leaving, 
Armenia and Azerbaijan were at loggerheads, and Georgia was 
still under the influence of the April events in Tbilisi -- 
everything was heading toward disintegration. The next day I 
asked Gorbachev whether he would agree to head our undertaking 
if we created the appropriate nucleus and then waited to see who 
else would join in. I believe that the attitude of the rest 
would have been far more favorable. But he categorically 
refused, he was convinced that he would hold on to them all and 
that even the Baltic would reconsider. Then he began the 
well-known Novo-Ogarevo process in which he included all the 
Russian autonomous formations, there were 50 of us sitting 
there, it was a shambles. We could not reach a single decision, 
everyone defended his own corner. 
  I took part in all of this simply because I realized what 
the 
result of a breakdown of ties would be if we started ripping a 
living organism to shreds. That is what we are going through 
now. There is no Union, everyone is free, but those who, by 
their actions, prompted this disintegration did not foresee the 
consequences of it. Possession of the outer trappings of 
independence does not mean that each country is capable of 
pursuing a sovereign foreign policy and of ensuring national 
security -- national not in the sense of ethnic but in the sense 
generally accepted in the world: not just state security but 
also stability in the economy and in all spheres of life. 
  Then the Belovezhskaya accords were signed. They could 
have been prepared differently, the stages could have been 
thought through differently, but by that time there was no 
single, manageable state left. In other words, we were 
inevitably moving toward the conditions that we have now. 
  [Latsis] Surely it may now be said that all the inevitable 
defects of the Belovezhskaya accords were the price to be paid 
for the rejection of the proposals of your group of four a year 
earlier. The logic of the accords was ultimately what you 
thought it would be: If all the republics were not ready at a 
given moment to take the new path together it was necessary to 
create a nucleus of those which were ready. But by December 
1991 only Russia constituted such a nucleus because Ukraine was 
increasingly a victim of certain delusions. 
  [Nazarbayev] Perhaps I will be criticized for being a victim 
of my upbringing -- I grew up in a single state where we did 
everything together -- but there are nevertheless certain 
pragmatic considerations here. When such scientific and 
technical progress and such a struggle for market territory are 
going on, the only way to survive is through unification. The 
countries of Western Europe, with their 1,000 years of 
statehood, are moving toward unification -- Mitterrand has even 
begun talking about a confederation. Because they understand 
that several poles of tremendous competition are developing in 
the world. There is North America, the Far East from Japan to 
the new "tiger" states, and the Asian continent, which is being 
revitalized. 
  [Latsis] I would find it difficult to determine on the spur 
of the moment just where Kazakhstan would fit into that 
geography. 
  [Nazarbayev] That is the whole question. It is our fate, 
the fate of the former Union republics, that we have the ability 
and need to resolve and do many things together. There are 
forms and mechanisms of ties and management and a mentality that 
are only characteristic of this area, the former USSR. Now the 
crisis of the social system is being aggravated by the crisis of 
the breakdown of state unity and all this contributes elements 
of social confusion which intensify the political crises and 
conflicts. We want to minimize the economic and social 
consequences of the destruction of the Union. 
  Of course, there is no need to revive the empire, which 
denationalized the republics, and no one wants to do that. But 
the demands of the economy are objective and do not depend on 
national borders. Unfortunately, our practical attempts to 
settle things have been running into some incomprehensible 
suspicions. The prime minister of Kazakhstan has just recently 
put forward proposals on an Interstate Economic Council and 
immediately people begin asking: What is this -- a new USSR 
Council of Ministers? But there are such things as the European 
Parliament, the Commission of the European Union, and common 
interstate organs. 
  [Latsis] But they did not begin with the European 
Parliament. They began even before the creation of the "Common 
Market" with the European Coal and Steel Community. 
  [Nazarbayev] That is what I propose. I invited all the CIS 
industry ministers to Karaganda last year and proposed such an 
association. Incidentally, at a meeting of CIS leaders an 
agreement on a coal and steel trust was signed. But we are not 
in the same position as Western Europe. Why should we take 30 
years to travel that road when we have had far closer unity for 
a long time already? The Economic Union, the draft for which 
was elaborated in Kazakhstan, envisages the conclusion of a 
customs union and a currency union, the creation of a common 
economic area, and the coordination of foreign economic policy. 
  [Latsis] The currency union question causes alarm in Russia. 
When we tried to preserve the single ruble zone Russia often 
footed the bill for its neighbors' money emission. 
  [Nazarbayev] Now that the national currency has been 
introduced we can see that Kazakhstan can stand on its own two 
feet, just like Russia. But is isolation beneficial to us? Our 
Ekibastuz sends a large part of its coal to Russia. Unless 
Russia invests money in its development we will simply not be 
able to maintain it, it is geared toward the whole Union. There 
is coal in Russia, it could be used in place of our supplies, 
but how many trillions will it cost to produce it? In addition, 
the Sokolovsko-Sarbayskiy combine fully supplies Magnitka and 
other plants in the Urals with ore. We can sell that ore to 
other countries but how much time and money will it cost Russia 
to get its ore elsewhere? Russia can also us its own oil to 
replace Kazakhstan's oil, which keeps refineries in the Volga 
region working, but that, too, will involve great expense. On 
the other hand, if we lose our supplies from Russia we will have 
to build enormous machine building plants of our own. We do not 
want to do that but we have to take our own interests into 
account, too. The virgin lands needs Kirov tractors, but they 
already cost more than the world price and for the world price 
we can buy better tractors elsewhere. 
  Take our ties with Ukraine. Two years ago the Ukrainians 
cut off their supply of pipes to us, pipes which we have always 
received in exchange for metal bars from Karaganda. They told 
us -- we will sell it all to the West and give you nothing. We 
said: fine. Within a year a pipe manufacturing machine was 
installed at the Karaganda combine -- with the Russians' help. 
We were denied construction metal -- again we installed a 
machine. Buses from Lvov, refrigerators, we will sell the whole 
lot over there, they said, and give you nothing more. This year 
they are saying: Take whatever you need: pipes, refrigerators, 
buses, sugar. But we are saying: We have already bought all 
these things and have begun making some of them ourselves. 
  A single economic area must be created. So far, after two 
and one-half years, there isn't a single effective coordinating 
organ to simply monitor what work is being done to fulfill the 
agreements and report back to the presidents. It is necessary 
to harmonize legislation -- customs, currency, and taxation 
legislation. Incidentally, in 1991 after the putsch we created 
the State Council and the Interstate Economic Committee, 
Yavlinskiy and others were appointed there, and 26 relevant 
coordinated documents were prepared. On 11 October 11 states 
met here in Almaty and signed the economic agreement which was 
ratified a few days later in Moscow. 
  [Latsis] The day before the State Council session where all 
this was decided Yavlinskiy came to our editorial office to ask 
for support and I was instructed to write an article for the 
next day. We supported all this with great enthusiasm but we 
could see that the chances of achieving a common accord were not 
great. Ukraine, and not just Ukraine, could not see what lay 
ahead if we did not go down the road of reforms together. 
  [Nazarbayev] Yes, here in Almaty Fokin signed the document 
but in Moscow he merely attended the signing, only seven or 
eight states signed. Yavlinskiy's group worked very 
conscientiously then and prepared some excellent documents but 
clearly you learn some things only from bitter experience. 
After all, in those days, when there was no market plan, each 
one believed that the rest were living off him. Turkmenia 
believed that the others were getting rich from its gas. In 
Russia's case, from its oil. Kazakhstan also believed that it 
was being ripped off, and so on. 
  But even then I believed and still do believe that we need 
integration and that under certain conditions Russia could be 
the core of it. But what we want is Russia to make up its own 
mind what kind of state it is building. If it wants to continue 
following the course of its thousand-year old historical pattern 
as the ultimate foundation of the building of a superstate, that 
is one thing, if we are friendly neighbors to one another, that 
is a different matter. But some Russian leaders suffer from 
euphoric notions about the possibility of full integration into 
the Western world, then they suddenly turn toward Asia and there 
are statements from state figures about Russia's special rights 
and duties on the territory of the former Union, which cause 
great uproar throughout the world. Of course a new state needs 
time to determine its interests and establish its own policy and 
we for our part are ready to regard these inevitable quests with 
understanding and patience. But when people talk about the 
possible division of Kazakhstan, about claims to its territory, 
and about threats to Russia emanating from the territory of the 
former USSR, my first question is this: When did Kazakhstan cut 
itself off from Russia? What grounds are there for suspicions? 
People often ask me: You are constantly calling for the 
strengthening of relations with Russia and you speak about all 
Russians, ethnic and otherwise, with great respect. Why do we 
not hear the same kind of thing from Russia's leaders about all 
the Kazakhs, ethnic and otherwise? 
  The question of the migration of the Russians from 
Kazakhstan 
is being raised and in that connection it is being suggested to 
us that we introduce dual citizenship to guarantee their rights. 
However, that will not lead to equality of rights, on the 
contrary, it will bestow on the Russian citizens of our state 
dual rights and thus dual obligations. Then the Kazakhs -- 
whether I want it or not -- will begin having doubts about the 
loyalty of their Russian fellow citizens who are simultaneously 
citizens of another state. 
  [Latsis] Fortunately there is no need to insist on that 
option. But people must be reassured somehow. You can promise 
whatever you like but people have lost faith after what happened 
in Tajikistan, Fergana, and Osh. They may believe your 
government when it says that it has no evil designs but will the 
government be able to protect them if anything happens? 
  [Nazarbayev] I put forward a proposal on how to resolve 
this problem and Kozyrev agreed with me. Lat us work to ensure 
that the border between our states is always transparent. Let us 
make mutual commitments toward the citizens of our states just 
in case any of them ever want to change citizenship. If someone 
moves from Kazakhstan to Russia, give him citizenship there. If 
a German moves away from here he receives a German passport and 
thus becomes a German citizen. Why should we not do that? 
Kazakhstan for its part makes the commitment that if a person 
decides, during the course of a year, for example, that he 
cannot settle down somewhere else and wants to return he will 
get citizenship of Kazakhstan back again. 
  Meanwhile, the migration statistics do not always reveal the 
real processes. The exodus of Russians from Kazakhstan is far 
from always due to problems of interethnic relations, 
citizenship, and the like. Take Kurchatov, a city which for a 
long time did not appear on the map. This is the Semipalatinsk 
test range. Some 27,000 people have moved away from there. But 
these are exclusively military people or people connected with 
military nuclear research. They were never citizens, they were 
always seconded here from Russia and now there is no work for 
them any more. There is also Priozersk on the shores of Lake 
Balkhash, a city which is not shown on the maps -- it is a test 
range pure and simple. Some 25,000 people have left that place. 
In West Kazakhstan there is the city of Emba, it is not on the 
maps, they used to carry out rocket launches there -- people 
have left it, too. And the whole of Leninsk which they have now 
begun to mention by name -- previously they only talked about 
Baykonur -- is also leaving as the programs are being scaled 
down. How can we hold onto them? 
  We would like treaties with Russia on all these questions: 
on military cooperation, including the extension of the work of 
our 50 defense enterprises to Russia, and on the terms of the 
lease and use of the Baykonur cosmodrome -- this is in both 
sides' interests. Russia cannot contemplate the cost of 
building another comsodrome right now and we do not want the 
center to fade away. 
  All these questions will be examined at the forthcoming 
meeting with the Russian President. But the main thing -- which 
applies not just to this meeting -- is that we need 
understanding and full trust between our countries. Not to 
mention the various fabrications about Kazakhstan's position on 
various questions which constantly crop up in the press and in 
speeches by individual politicians. But the main problem is not 
one of fabrications or gossip. In the activity of some Russian 
politicians you sometimes hear echoes of familiar Soviet ideas: 
Moscow's interests are paramount, the rest must adapt to them. 
I proceed from the premise that Kazakhstan has its own 
legitimate interests but so do our partners. 
  [Latsis] It is of course perfectly normal for a country to 
have interests of its own. But if you disregard the speculation 
and simple misunderstandings you will see that Russia is looking 
after its own interests, too. I, for example, understand the 
reasons why Shokhin insisted on very tough conditions for the 
continued functioning of the common ruble zone -- it is a 
different matter that I do not understand why such 
principledness has not been shown in regard to Belarus. But 
perhaps agreement would have been reached with Kazakhstan, too, 
if you had observed the same tough restrictions on emission as, 
for example, Latvia did. Admittedly, Russia itself did not 
observe the same kind of financial rigor either. 
  [Nazarbayev] We had our reasons for easing off, we were 
trying to lighten the social problems of people cut off from the 
former common state. However, the Russian side's strict demands 
on the financial question are understandable. The only thing 
that I cannot understand is why they did not tell us this before 
and, what is more, I cannot understand the exchange of banknotes 
operation after which money no longer valid in Russia was dumped 
on Kazakhstan for three months through every available channel. 
  [Latsis] That action by Gerashchenko was bound to cause 
nothing but indignation. We at IZVESTIYA wrote that it was 
blatantly aimed against the former republics of the USSR and 
furthermore that it would do Russia itself no good. But many 
things in what Russia actually does and even more so in the 
things it fails to do are due not to malice but to the fact that 
it cannot do everything. Until September-October last year, 
furthermore, there was a power struggle going in Russia and as 
far as some politicians were concerned relations with the former 
Soviet republics were simply fodder for that struggle. 
  [Nazarbayev] That is precisely what I want to avoid in the 
future. Russia and Kazakhstan are linked by deep and permanent 
mutual interests which exist objectively regardless of any 
short-term considerations, intrigues, or misunderstandings. It 
is this real interest in cooperation and the community of our 
interests which must determine our actions.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Perkina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 14 TASS -- Elections to the Federal 
Assembly and the local representative bodies of power took place 
last Sunday in a number of Russia's regions. 
  This time more than half of the adult population came to the 
polls in Tatarstan, where the elections to the Federal Assembly 
were held again after the failure of December 12. On the eve of 
the elections President Mintimer Shaymiyev said that the 
republic had radically changed the political course. After the 
signing of the intergovernmental treaty with Russia, the people 
of Tatarstan decided to send their representatives to the 
federal parliament. 
  Preliminary results will probably become known today, while 
the official results will be announced on Tuesday, a spokesman 
for the elections headquarters told ITAR-TASS. 
  A little more than 37 per cent of electors came to the 
polling stations in Chuvashia. This figure reflects a 
tremendous difference in opinions, Chairman of the Republican 
Electoral Commission Anatoliy Ukhtiyarov believes. In a number 
of rural areas some 75 per cent of the adult population took 
part in the voting, while in Cheboksary the figure was 19 per 
cent, and in Novocheboksarsk even less than that. Thus, even 
before the preliminary results are announced, it is clear that 
repeated elections will be held in Chuvashia late in March. The 
struggle will be continued by the candidates who win the first 
and the second place. Today it will be known whether or not 
the rural areas of the republic managed to elect deputies in 
their constituencies with the first attempt. 
  It is obvious now that the elections to the regional and 
city 
dumas were a success in the Kostroma region. Most 
constituencies managed to exceed the "25 per cent plus one" 
limit. In the evening it became clear that more than one third 
of the electors agree with the need to form new bodies of power 
to replace the soviets. 
  Along with elections to the Duma, Kostroma became the first 
city in Russia to hold a referendum on the "city constitution," 
which is a kind of local government regulations. For the 
Constitution to become valid, it should have been supported by 
50 per cent of Kostroma residents. However, only 25 per cent of 
the city residents came to the polling stations, and the 
referendum actually did not take place. 
  Elections to the territorial legislative assembly and local 
government bodies failed to attract the needed number of 
electors in the Altay region. According to the preliminary 
results, received by ITAR-TASS at the regional electoral 
commission, 36.8 per cent of officially registered electors took 
part in the voting. 
  Fifty candidates were vying for 15 seats in the legislative 
assembly of the Jewish autonomous region. The results show that 
the elections did take place in 12 constituencies. According to 
local government regulations, the assembly will be given the 
status of a local legislative authority, Chairman of the 
Regional Electoral Commission Yakov Sherman told ITAR-TASS. In 
three constituencies of Birobidzhan, where less than 25 per cent 
of electors turned up, repeated elections will be held. 
  Birobidzhan March 14 TASS -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent 
Viktor Gorelkin -- The 12 seats in the legislative assembly of 
the Jewish region were distributed in the following way: Four 
went to heads of local administrations, six -- to senior 
officials of industrial enterprises, one -- to a medic and one 
to an economist. 
  An electoral campaign is going on in other Russian cities. 
It entered a decisive stage in the Novgorod region, where 
elections to the duma will be held on March 27. 143 candidates 
will vie for 27 seats. It will not be easy for residents of the 
Novgorod region to make a choice. This is also true of 
residents of the Novosibirsk region. However, according to the 
results of public opinion polls, only 40 per cent of them are 
going to take part in the voting on March 27 during the 
elections to the regional Council of Deputies. 
  So far as the Chechen Republic (Chechnya) is concerned, its 
authorities refuse so much as to discuss elections and are very 
far from holding them. Movladiy Udugov, head of the information 
and press department of the republic, said laconically in a 
telephone interview with ITAR-TASS: "I know elections are 
taking place in some regions of Russia. As for us, we are 
getting prepared for the end of the Uraza celebrations." 
According to Udugov, Chechnya is more concerned now over the 
growing number of the acts of subversion and provocations, 
obviously aimed at again destabilising the situation in the 
republic. 
  Khabarovsk March 14 TASS -- Elections, held on Sunday in the 
Khabarovsk region, revealed the names of 18 out of 25 deputies 
to the regional duma. Two thirds of the duma have been elected, 
and the new representative authority will soon start functioning. 
  Candidates from the democratic choice bloc again suffered a 
crushing defeat. Only one of fifteen candidates was elected to 
the regional duma. Members of the Communist Party did not win 
the support of electors either. They will also have only one 
representative in the duma. Most deputies are industrial 
managers of various levels, as well as heads of local 
administrations, lawyers and servicemen. As a rule, they were 
all nominated by groups of electors. 
  "On the whole, the results of the elections may be described 
as positive," Viktor Tsirfa, chairman of the regional electoral 
commission, told ITAR-TASS. "The defeat of the Democratic 
Choice, of other political parties and movements, can hardly be 
regarded as accidental. People are tired of confrontation, of 
the endless settlement of scores. I think, a large number of 
heads of state enterprises and business structures, elected to 
the duma, will make it possible for the new authority to work in 
a constructive way. In seven constituencies, where less than 25 
per cent of electors came to the polls, or where most electors 
crossed out the names of all candidates, repeated elections will 
be held next autumn."

  [Text] The inhabitants of Nizhnevartovsk, Siberian oilmen's 
largest city, have declined to elect deputies to the City Duma 
and the Duma of the Khantiy-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug [of Tyumen 
Oblast]. As RIA was informed at the City Electoral Commission, 
because of the failure of voters to turn out, the 6 March 
elections are recognized to have taken place in only one of the 
electoral districts of Nizhnevartovsk. As a result, only one 
deputy has been elected to the City Duma.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Dudnikov: "No Quorum"] </F>
  [Text] Salekhard -- The fate of the elections to the 
Russian Federation Federal Assembly and local organs of power in 
Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug hung by a thread. By 1700 hours 
on 6 March only 23.8 percent of the total electorate had voted. 
  Gasworkers, oilworkers, fishermen, and hunters had not gone 
to the voting stations, because they had been sitting waiting 
for their pay for a long time. 
  In order to save the situation, the organizers of the 
campaign were forced to bring into play various methods of 
influencing voters. Appeals were repeatedly broadcast on okrug 
radio, while in some places they actually traveled to healthy 
people's homes with the ballot boxes. Although, as is known, in 
former times this practice was reserved for invalids and the 
sick. 
  So the final total for the number of voters rose to 28.7 
percent, which was enough to declare the elections valid. 
  Of the six contenders for the Federation Council, Okrug 
Administration Head Yu.V. Neyelov won by a large margin. 
  Two well-known people in Yamal made it to the okrug 
parliament: Vasiliy Tikhonovich Podshibyakin, general director 
of the geological association, and Kh.M. Yezengi, president of 
the "Yamal For Future Generations" association. But one seat in 
the okrug Duma remains vacant. This means there can be no 
quorum. So, in all likelihood, Yamal can expect yet another 
election.

  [Text] Elista March 11 TASS -- "The Constitution of the 
Kalmyk Republic will be abolished, we recognize the Russian 
Constitution as the only valid one on Kalmyk territory. We will 
also abandon the Kalmyk citizenship, Russia should have Russian 
citizenship," Kalmyk President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov told a 
parliament meeting here today. 
  "Russia is single and indivisible. Its revival is impossible 
without the revival of national provinces and the revival of 
provinces is impossible without the revival of the whole state," 
he stressed. 
  Ilyumzhinov suggested to terminate the validity of the 
Kalmyk 
Constitution on March 25 and form a delegation to meet Russian 
President Yeltsin. He wants to ask "the president for an 
instrument of ratification to give him or another official the 
power to be named president, governor or head of the republic 
for five-ten years. The decision is up to the Russian 
president".

  [Excerpts] Elista March 12 TASS -- Participants in a 
spontaneous protest meeting, which is now under way in Elista, 
capital of Kalmykia, are expressing disagreement with the recent 
statements of the Kalmyk president on the elimination of the 
republican Constitution. [passage omitted] 
  Commenting on [Kalmyk President] Ilyumzhinov's statement in 
an ITAR-TASS interview, David Kugultinov, a popular Kalmyk poet 
and chairman of the Council of Elders at the president, 
described it as an "ill-considered step." "One should at least 
consult the people and find out their opinion, before taking 
such an important decision. By all appearances, the suggestion 
of our leader came as a result of instability in Russia, as well 
as in its leadership. I do not think that Kalmykia will turn 
into an out-of-the-way place, if it loses its status of a 
republic and its Constitution. But it will lose the energy of 
statehood, which has been and continues to be a source of hope 
for all those who live on its territory. Haste has never done 
any good to anybody, and I am sure the Kalmyk people will 
realise it and will not support their president," Kugultinov 
said.

  [Text] Chechen Foreign Minister Shamseddin Yusef said at a 
press conference in Groznyy on Friday that he could not work in 
the Foreign Ministry due to the conditions there and was going 
to resign. 
  According to him, the resignation was due to the fact that a 
foreign ministry's official laid off because he had worked for 
seven years for the KGB had been reinstated by Chechen President 
Johar Dudayev. 
  However, observers said the real reason for the resignation 
was the government's resolution on significant reduction in the 
number of the foreign ministry's personnel (up to 14 people).

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kamyshev report: "Situation in North Caucasus. </F>
North Ossetian Parliament May Lift State of Emergency Rule"] 
  [Text] Tensions in the area of the Ossetian-Ingush 
conflict may begin ratcheting up in the very near future. 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY learned yesterday that some deputies of the 
North Ossetian parliament expressed no-confidence in the 
Provisional Administration of the State of Emergency Area and 
proposed that the state of emergency rule on the republic's 
territory not be extended. If this decision is made, Moscow 
will lose the possibility to contain the conflict by force, and 
the situation may consequently spin out of the federal 
authorities' control. 
  The North Ossetian authorities' support for the Provisional 
Administration has until recently been a very significant and 
necessary factor for Moscow, particularly after Ingush President 
Ruslan Aushev accused Provisional Administration chief Vladimir 
Lozovoy in January of deliberately trying to thwart the 
implementation of the Russian president's December edict on the 
return of Ingush refugees; Aushev also demanded that Lozovoy be 
removed from office. Now North Ossetian politicians, too, have 
expressed no-confidence in the Provisional Administration, 
claiming that it is unable to bring order and security to the 
state of emergency area. In this situation Vladimir Lozovoy's 
very presence in the state of emergency area is becoming 
nonsensical, because the presidential and government decisions 
on conflict settlement simply cannot be implemented without 
close contacts with the local authorities. 
  What poses a much greater danger is the proposal by some 
North Ossetian Supreme Soviet deputies not to extend the state 
of emergency rule, which will expire on 31 March, because, in 
their view, it has proved ineffective. This decision, if 
adopted, may spark the resumption of the armed conflict in its 
initial, most bloody version. Given that none of the earlier 
agreements and decrees on the return of refugees have been 
complied with, the troops deployed in the state of emergency 
area operate as a containment force: Their very presence is 
cooling down somewhat the "hotheads" who call on the Ingush to 
return to their land in Prigorodnyy Rayon regardless of the 
consequences. If these forces are withdrawn from the region, 
even Ruslan Aushev's high authority will be not enough to keep 
the refugees from returning on their own and to avert the 
possible bloodshed. 
  Moscow may buy time, however, if it agrees with the Ingush 
and Ossetian demands to replace the Provisional Administration 
chief. In this event the two sides will need some time to assess 
the activity of a new person and to draw corresponding 
conclusions, whereas the Russian authorities may use the respite 
to prepare new initiatives to settle the conflict.

  [Excerpt] Tel Aviv, 11 Mar -- [Passage omitted] In a 
conversation with the ITAR-TASS correspondent, [Russian Foreign 
Minister] A. Kozyrev expressed his satisfaction with the 
exchange of opinions he had with Israeli leaders. He also noted 
that Russia is making unorthodox efforts for the sake of saving 
the peace process in this region. He said that after the Hebron 
tragedy, events in the Middle East took a dramatic turn and it 
was necessary to take extraordinary measures for saving the 
agreements reached between Israel and PLO earlier. This visit, 
which is aimed at persuading the Israelis and the Palestinians 
to return to negotiations table, was one of such measures. 
  Tonight, the Russian foreign minister departed for Tunis 
where he will have talks with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat.

  [Text] Cairo, 11 Mar -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev arrived this evening in Tunis on a working visit. The 
Palestine Liberation Organization is headquartered in the 
Tunisian capital. The Russian foreign minister will hold talks 
with the Palestinian leadership, in particular he will meet 
Yasir 'Arafat and will pass to him a personal message from 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  The main goal of the visit is to assist in bringing together 
the stances of the PLO and Israel and to achieve a compromise 
with regard to resuming the Palestinian-Israeli dialogue as soon 
as possible. This dialogue was frozen two weeks ago after a 
Jewish settler opened fire on Arabs during worship at a mosque 
in al-Khalil on the occupied West Bank. 
  The MENA news agency reports that Andrey Kozyrev intends to 
set out Russia's viewpoint to the PLO on the current stage of 
the Middle East peace process, which is above all the need to 
implement the PLO-Israeli agreement on self-government for 
Palestinians in the Gaza strip and the Jericho area. 
  The Russian foreign affairs head and the PLO Executive 
Committee chairman are expected to begin their talks within the 
next few hours. Also, during his stay in Tunis, Andrey Kozyrev 
is expected to be received by Tunisian President Zine El Abidine 
Ben Ali. 
  The Russian minister arrived in Tunis from Israel, where 
today he held a series of intensive consultations with his 
opposite number Shim'on Peres and met Jewish Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin.

  [Text] Rabat, 12 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- "Yasir 'Arafat has 
confirmed the firm adherence of the Palestinian Liberation 
Organization to the peace process and has stressed that the PLO 
is committed to resuming the talks" with Israel, Russian 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev has reported. He 
made the statement in Tunis on the results of the meeting with 
the chairman of the PLO Executive Committee. During the meeting 
Yasir 'Arafat was handed a personal message from Russian 
Federation [RF] President Boris Yeltsin. Kozyrev pointed out 
that the decision of the Palestinian side demanded great 
political courage on the part of the PLO and of Y. 'Arafat 
personally. 
  The Palestinian leadership is counting on the swift and 
complete carrying out of the resolution, the draft of which was 
drawn up at the UN Security Council in connection with the 
massacre at El-Khalil, the head of the RF foreign political 
department noted. The PLO is hoping that Russia and the United 
States as co-founders of the Arab-Israeli peace talks will 
guarantee the implementation of this document. 
  In the opinion of the Russian minister, the priority task at 
the present time is the fastest possible implementation of the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement on the Gaza sector and Jericho, 
which was signed in Washington in September last year. Russia, 
stressed A. Kozyrev, will promote the implementation of the 
provisions of this agreement and the UN Security Council 
resolution as far as possible, "which everyone is expecting". 
  The Russian side is also in favor of the resumption of the 
talks between all the Arab states and Israel for the purpose of 
acceleratingn progress towards an agreement in all the 
directions of the dialogue, Kozyrev stated. He said that he 
intended to discuss the question of the role of the co-founders 
of the Near East peace process at the forthcoming stage during 
the meeting which is soon to take place with U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher in Vladivostok.

  [Text] Rome March 12 TASS -- Israel and the PLO have made a 
political decision -- they will resume negotiations. However, 
this decision is directly linked to the adoption of a U.N. 
resolution on the el-Khalil tragedy, Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev said upon the completion of his working visit to 
the Middle East. 
  The minister was to make a brief stopover in Rome last 
night, 
but did not do so on weather conditions. His plane made a short 
landing in Genoa. 
  According to the reports of ANSA news agency, the minister 
summed up the first results of his Israeli visit, where he had a 
series of intensive consultations with Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, and the Tunisian 
visit, where he met PLO Leader Yasir 'Arafat. 
  In the opinion of Kozyrev, Israel and the PLO "showed an 
example of political responsibility and courage by deciding to 
resume the dialogue". It is necessary that the U.N. Security 
Council shows the same responsibility and adopts a resolution to 
denounce the events in el-Khalil in the immediate future, said 
Kozyrev. 
  If the political aspect of the problem is settled, there 
will 
only technical details left. "So, the sooner the Security 
Council adopts the resolution the better," he said. 
  As for the place and date of resumed negotiations and the 
level of delegations, they will be fixed by the interested 
sides. "We will accept any their decision to the effect and if 
requested are ready to offer assistance," said the Russian 
foreign minister. 
  Kozyrev described as "very inspiring" the Israeli-PLO 
decision and said "it was more dramatic for Yasir 'Arafat". As 
for Kozyrev's negotiations with the PLO leader, they "were 
sincere and constructive". 
  Kozyrev said he plans to meet U.S. State Secretary Warren 
Christopher in Vladivostok on his way to Russia from China in 
order to discuss "their possible assistance to the Mideast 
negotiations at the current stage as the process co-sponsors".

  [Text] Rabat March 14 TASS -- Russian president's envoy in 
the Middle East, Viktor Posuvalyuk, had a third consecutive 
meeting with PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis on Sunday [13 
March] night. 
  The Russian envoy was reported to deliver an important 
message from Moscow addressed to the PLO leader and related to 
Russo-Palestinian consultations held in connection with the 
aggravation of the situation in the Middle East following the 
Al-Khalil [Hebron] massacre. 
  During the talks the sides discussed problems pertaining to 
a 
resolution expected to be adopted by the U.N. Security Council 
to ensure measures of international defence of Palestinians on 
Israeli occupied territories. 
  The PLO leader is expected to visit Moscow at the invitation 
of the Russian president on April 9. Palestinian sources say 
that the sides would thoroughly discuss issues of the 
development of bilateral relations and Russia's role in the 
process of establishing Palestinian self-rule in Gaza Strip and 
the town of Jericho.

<F P=106> [Konstantin Eggert report: "Visit To Near East Could Not Be </F>
Kept Secret"] 
  [Text] Andrey Kozyrev's lightning trip to Tunisia and 
Israel, which was announced out of the blue, is an event which 
ought not to be underestimated in terms of significance. For 
the first time in a long while the general public will finally 
get the chance to find out whether the new Russia has a new 
policy in the Near East, and if so what it is. 
  However, on the subject of the public, there was no 
intention 
of actually informing it: The visit was planned as secret. A 
Foreign Ministry staffer literally flew into a rage when he 
learned that information about it had nevertheless been leaked 
to news agencies. Sanctions followed immediately -- press 
representatives were deprived of the chance to accompany the 
minister. 
  All the signs of preparations for a major step in the Near 
East sphere have been visible of late: To begin with, First 
Deputy Minister Igor Ivanov visited Tunisia and Israel, and then 
Viktor Posuvalyuk, leader of the Near East and North Africa 
Department, held talks with Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis itself. In 
Moscow Ivanov unveiled a plan for staging a new international 
forum for settling the Arab-Israeli conflict, intended to 
develop the principles agreed at the Madrid Conference in 1991. 
  This idea was greeted without particular enthusiasm by 
Washington and Tel Aviv. Among other things, the Israelis are 
noticeably concerned about the clear linkage between the upsurge 
in diplomatic activity on the part of Moscow and the tragedy in 
Hebron, which prompted increased sympathies for the 
Palestinians. Yitzhaq Rabin's government fears that, while 
promising to bring 'Arafat back to the negotiating table, Russia 
will try to win certain concessions for the PLO, striving to win 
back the authority in the Arab East which was lost in the years 
of rapprochement with the West. 
  There is no doubt that Andrey Kozyrev will get a warm 
reception in Tunis, site of PLO headquarters: The Palestinians 
are still nurturing illusions, hoping for a resurrection of 
Russia's regional role as a counterbalance to American 
influence. By contrast, the discussion in Tel Aviv promises to 
be difficult -- the degree of distrust in Israel toward Moscow, 
for decades the main sponsor of Arab dictators, is very great. 
Given all this, it is hard to imagine that Kozyrev's mission 
can culminate in any significant results.

  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- Andrey Kozyrev, the 
head of Russian diplomacy, has spoken in favor of strategic 
partnership between Russian and the United States at a news 
conference held at Vnukovo airport prior to his departure for 
Vladivostok to meet his U.S. counterpart Warren Christopher. 
  Answering questions about the Ames' affair and also about 
the 
events linked to the visit of Former U.S. President Richard 
Nixon to Moscow, the Russian foreign minister expressed an 
opinion that there were certain circles both in the United 
States and Russia that did not like the idea of cooperation 
between Russia and the United States, especially strategic 
cooperation. 
  A. Kozyrev added that Russian-U.S. relations will continue 
to 
be based on the principles stated in the Moscow Declaration. 
This partnership is strategic and mature and its main features 
are community of interests and close contacts. 
  Commenting on the situation in former Yugoslavia at the 
request of journalists, the Russian foreign minister noted that 
the decisions of the Security Council envisaged the use of force 
in extreme cases. He explained that this refers, for example, 
to attacks on peacekeeping formations. We adhere to this 
principle, Kozyrev said. The Russian peacekeepers, he stressed, 
should not be hostages to the tension in the region. 
  Analyzing the prospects for a settlement in the Near East 
following his trip to the region, the leader of Russian 
diplomacy pointed out that at present one of the main aims is to 
complete the talks on the Gaza sector and Jericho. Only after 
that will it be possible, in his opinion, to convene a new 
Madrid Conference in one form or another. 
  Speaking of his planned short visit to Tajikistan after his 
Vladivostok meeting, Kozyrev pointed out that such a trip 
presents a good opportunity to hold talks both with the 
government and the opposition. He said he would try to visit 
the Tajik-Afghan frontier in order to support Russian border 
guards. The minister said in the extreme case we are prepared 
for a rebuff, but our choice is dialogue, which should begin 
shortly. 
  Commenting upon the reports on the possible use of Western 
countries' peacekeeping forces in Georgia, the minister said 
that he did not yet see a real opportunity for that. He said 
that this question might be one of the topics discussed in 
Vladivostok.

  [Text] To develop partnership on a new basis -- this is how 
Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has described 
the aim of his working meeting with U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher, which is to be held in Vladivostok today. 
  Before leaving Moscow the Russian foreign minister stressed 
there could be no question of partnership between senior and 
junior; partners must move toward the same goals. There cannot 
be more freedom for one to the detriment of the other. In any 
case, it must be a bilateral approach, Kozyrev noted. 
  He rejected suppositions that relations have begun to cool 
between the United States and Russia. There can be differences 
of interests within the partnership sphere, the minister noted.

  [Text] Vladivostok March 14 TASS -- Russia and America 
acted as equal partners at the talks in Vladivostok and 
discussed many aspects of international relations. The two 
countries agreed to team up and work together on the problem of 
nuclear non-proliferation. 
  The announcement was made at a news conference after the 
talks between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Vladivostok on Monday. 
  "We are partners and will continue to work in this 
direction," Kozyrev said. Christopher said that despite the age 
difference he and Kozyrev are doing one work. 
  Speaking about Bosnia, both diplomats expressed satisfaction 
with the achieved results, including the compromise between the 
warring factions. 
  Also discussed was the possibility of transforming G-7 into 
G-8. 
  Kozyrev and Christopher said that relations between the two 
countries have passed the test of strength lately. They did not 
discuss the spy scandal involving a high-ranking CIA official, 
James Aldrich. 
  Concerning the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic 
states, Kozyrev said Russia stands for their soonest possible 
pullout and has nothing to do with the attempts of the Baltic 
republics to deport the Russian troops. He said Russia will 
take part in COCOM. 
  Asked about the situation in the Sea of Okhotsk, the Russian 
foreign minister said that Russia calls for the preservation of 
fish resources in the sea. There has been understanding on the 
part of the United States. In the future both countries plan to 
discuss this issue, he said. 
  After the talks, Christopher left for the U.S. Kozyrev flew 
to Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan, to attend a meeting of 
the foreign ministers of Russia, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and 
Uzbekistan, and representatives of Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan. 
  The participants are expected to be received by Tajik 
President Emomali Rakhmanov. During the visit to Tajikistan, 
Kozyrev will take a trip to the Tajik-Afghan border.

  [Text] Vladivostok March 14 TASS -- "A strong Russia needs 
a strong navy," Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey 
Kozyrev said when visiting big anti-submarine ship Admiral 
Panteleyev here today. 
  The visit, which preceded Kozyrev's talks with U.S. 
Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher, was seen by many as having a 
special symbolic overtone. "We did not plan for it," the Russian 
minister told ITAR-TASS. "But it is indicative that the ship was 
part of the multinational force which sailed to the Persian Gulf 
to train interaction with U.S. naval ships". 
  According to first deputy commander of the Pacific Fleet 
Vice-Admiral Igor Khmelnov, the joint exercises confirmed that 
the Russian combat equipment and the combat training of the 
Russian sailors are in no way worse than those of the United 
States. 
  Andrey Kozyrev said the ships under the Russian flag in the 
Gulf were a factor of stability in the region. He called upon 
the sailors to prepare for a new mission, probably in the Latin 
American direction among others. 
  "Our presence in the world ocean must expand, the Russian 
minister stressed, "our partners will respect us all the more 
for this". 
  The ship's crew members told the minister with satisfaction 
that unlike the Black Sea Fleet, the Pacific Fleet is not 
threatened with a rift. 
  "We can speak about the division of the Black Sea Fleet only 
in a conventional manner. Under the well-known agreement 
reached in Masandra, the fleet must be united". He called on 
the sailors to upgrade their training and advised "to pay less 
attention to the political races". 
  "We have our president, we have our Constitution, and we 
have 
a firm political course", the Russian foreign minister said. 
"The great Russian power existed, exists and will exist".

<F P=106> [Maksim Yusin report: "Relations Between Russia and the </F>
United States Are Experiencing the Most Serious Crisis of Recent 
Years. Kozyrev and Christopher Face Difficult Conversation in 
Vladivostok"] 
  [Text] The Vladivostok meeting between the Russian foreign 
minister and the U.S. secretary of state scheduled for 14 March 
comes at a time of coolness in relations between Moscow and 
Washington, which not so long ago appeared cloudless. 
  There are several reasons for this. The first is the 
December elections, which brought victory for the 
national-communists and reminded the Americans that 
unpredictable Russia remains a potential enemy of the West and a 
threat to security in the world. Second, Washington cannot fail 
to be concerned by the changes which have appeared of late in 
Kremlin policy: the proclamation of the former USSR republics 
to be a zone of Russia's special interests, the unwillingness to 
withdraw troops from Latvia and Estonia, and resolute support 
for the Bosnian Serbs. "After defeat at the elections, the 
Russian authorities decided to adopt the opposition's slogans. 
For a while it has been difficult to determine to whom certain 
remarks in the sphere of foreign policy should be attributed -- 
Kozyrev or Zyuganov," a Western diplomat accredited in Moscow 
noted. 
  The third factor provoking the crisis between Russia and the 
United States is the success of Russian diplomacy in the 
Balkans. Having secured concessions from the Serbs and thereby 
averted military action by NATO, Moscow has proclaimed its 
status as a great power with whose opinion the West has to 
contend. The situation in Bosnia will be one of the main 
questions on the agenda of the Vladivostok meeting. "If Moscow 
and Washington manage to work out a joint stance, substantial 
progress can be expected over a Bosnian settlement given the 
influence which we have over the Serbs and which the Americans 
have over the Croats and the Muslims," a Russian diplomat 
dealing with the Balkans believes. 
  The subject of the Arab-Israeli conflict will probably arise 
in Vladivostok too. Kozyrev's sensational visit to Tunisia and 
Israel testifies to the seriousness of Russian diplomacy's 
intentions in the Near East. For two years everybody forgot 
that the Madrid conference on a Near East settlement had another 
cochairman apart from the United States -- Russia. Washington 
has borne the full burden of mediation between the Jews and the 
Arabs, and suddenly -- like a bolt from the blue -- Moscow comes 
forward with the unexpected idea of holding a new peace 
conference. 
  To all appearances, Christopher will use the meeting with 
his 
Russian colleague to make it clear to him that the United States 
will tolerate the revival of Moscow's old ambitions on the 
territory of the former USSR and even, to a certain extent, in 
the Balkans, but it by no means follows from this that it is 
prepared to accept a return by the Kremlin to its traditional 
role of defending the Arabs and fighting against Zionism in a 
region which Washington considers to be a zone of its own vital 
interests. 
  The participants in the Vladivostok talks will not let 
ex-President Richard Nixon's scandal-dogged trip to Moscow pass 
unnoticed. The Foreign Ministry came down firmly on the side of 
Boris Yeltsin, who reacted angrily to the former White House 
chief's contacts with the diehard opposition. "Nixon would have 
gone on to meet with Anpilov, Barkashov, and Vasilyev from 
'Pamyat,' and then ask for an audience with the Russian 
president.... Yeltsin's reaction was quite proper. We are 
entitled to expect respect," a high-ranking Russian diplomat 
said. 
  Moscow will also demand respect for its interests in "the 
near abroad." And although the United States has long since 
defined its approach in respect of the Baltic countries and is 
unlikely to yield to pressure from Moscow, Washington's plans in 
the sphere of Ukraine are not entirely clear. Kozyrev will try 
to clarify how far the reports that the United States intends to 
look upon Kiev as a counterweight to the increasing influence of 
Moscow correspond to reality. 
  Despite the abundance of delicate topics, the Russian 
Foreign 
Ministry will strive to avoid confrontation with Washington. In 
Vladivostok Kozyrev is unlikely to focus attention on 
differences of opinion, and he expects the same of Christopher. 
"There are no major reasons for exacerbating relations between 
Russia and the United States. The policy of strategic 
partnership proclaimed by Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton remains 
in force," IZVESTIYA was assured by an informed source on 
Smolenskaya Square.

<F P=106> [Sergey Tsekhmistrenko report: "Foreign Policy Council </F>
Meeting. Kozyrev: NATO Membership Card Is Not a Credit Card"] 
  [Text] It is essential not so much to enhance the military 
and political partnership of European countries, but rather to 
improve the mechanisms that have already been tested lest Europe 
be split by "a new Yalta." The thesis about setting NATO 
against the CSCE will, at Russia's prodding, apparently top the 
agenda of the December European summit. These ideas were also 
heard yesterday in Andrey Kozyrev's address before the Foreign 
Policy Council. The meeting discussed the NATO "Partnership for 
Peace" program (Pavel Grachev also spoke about it in Germany). 
After the minister's address the journalists were asked to 
leave, but your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, Sergey 
Tsekhmistrenko, managed to learn interesting details about the 
meeting in the lobby. 
  Kozyrev's speech has left the impression that Moscow is 
concerned by how the "Partnership" initiative is being put into 
practice. It is not a coincidence that the minister focused on 
the subject of counterbalances to NATO, pointing out that it is 
the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the CSCE that should 
become the core of Europe's future security system. To 
substantiate his stance, Kozyrev cited the following argument: 
"It is not NATO, but the CSCE that won the Cold War." But for 
the time being, in his words, "millions of misgivings" by the 
East Europeans and NATO members prevent a joint strategy from 
being devised. Moscow's former allies are flocking to NATO's 
doorstep, driven "by primitive calculations as they mix up a 
NATO membership card with a Western bank credit card." Making 
the reservation that he meant only "certain circles," Kozyrev 
still cautioned East European leaders, too, against mistakes for 
which they will have to pay "at the highest political rates." 
The Atlantists were also given a raw deal for their 
"NATO-centrism," being established "in a pretty simple and trite 
fashion" -- by expanding the bloc in numeric terms. 
  Most addresses by council members that followed had a fairly 
radical idea for a leitmotif: the "Partnership" is not as 
advantageous for Russia as might be seen from the Kremlin or 
Smolenskaya Square [Foreign Ministry]. The speakers said that 
Russia should not expect equality in its cooperation with the 
West. Moreover, many people saw the concept as a desire to 
isolate Russia. This point of view was summed up by Konstantin 
Zatulin, chairman of the State Duma committee for CIS affairs. 
He said that Russia's participation in the "Partnership" would 
dash its hopes in the near abroad, because even at present CIS 
countries are trying to blackmail Russia by appealing to the 
West. Given that, the parliamentarian has gotten the impression 
that "even Kazakhstani shores" were washed by the Atlantic 
Ocean. Vitaliy Churkin (who disagreed with Zatulin's view in 
general) conceded that the "little brothers," once they have 
grown up a bit, sometimes become, indeed, Moscow's main 
opponents in international organizations. The very question of 
"isolation" as raised by Mr. Zatulin, however, was somewhat 
strange, all the more so because the latter did not specify how 
Moscow could avoid it outside the "Partnership" once all former 
USSR republics join it.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev report: "Washington's White House Knew </F>
About Nixon's Meetings. The Kremlin Also Knew of Them in 
Advance"] 
  [Text] The Washington White House and President William 
Clinton personally knew that ex-President Richard Nixon, on 
setting out to visit Moscow, intended to meet with leaders of 
the Russian political opposition, including Zyuganov, Rutskoy, 
and Zhirinovskiy. No objections were made to Nixon on this 
score, nor was approval given, since these meetings were planned 
within the framework of the unofficial part of the trip by the 
ex-president, who had invitations both from the Russian Security 
Council and from the Foreign Policy Association. 
  The fact that this is so was confirmed by Clinton himself, 
who offered explanations to this effect on U.S. television 
Wednesday. According to our data, Thomas Pickering, the U.S. 
ambassador to Moscow, was given instructions, also Wednesday, to 
investigate the reasons for the diplomatic mini-scandal which 
marked the trip by Nixon, who was refused his preplanned 
meetings with Boris Yeltsin, Viktor Chernomyrdin, and other 
high-ranking staffers of the government and the presidential 
entourage. Pickering has already had contacts with the Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in this connection, in particular 
with Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov. 
  According to members of Nixon's delegation, the Russian 
president's statement that William Clinton had "distanced 
himself from the trip" was groundless. 
  Official Moscow was informed on the day the ex-president 
arrived in Russia, i.e. last Sunday [6 March], that Nixon would 
meet with opposition leaders: Foreign Ministry staffers and 
representatives of the Protocol Department of the Russian 
president's apparatus were issued with the program of the visit, 
listing the meetings. There was more than enough time to voice 
their objections and to demand that meetings be refused. But at 
that stage, so I was told by Nixon's delegation, no objections 
were forthcoming. 
  According to data from the Nixon delegation, the 
ex-president 
is gradually filling the gaps resulting from the refusals to 
meet with him. In particular, talks with Russian 
parliamentarians are scheduled for Thursday. 
  Attempts to obtain official comments from Russian sources -- 
from the Foreign Ministry, above all -- had not met with success 
by the time this issue was signed to press. On a strictly 
unofficial basis some diplomats regarded the report that 
Pickering had contacted Mamedov as "disinformation." It was 
also pointed out that the Russian Foreign Ministry has nothing 
to do with Nixon's visit. It must follow from this that the 
Foreign Ministry also was not familiar with the program of 
meetings in advance.

  [Text] Moscow March 11 TASS -- Dmitriy Simes, adviser of 
the U.S. ex-President Richard Nixon, accompanying him on the 
current visit to Russia, gave new details of Nixon's 
conversation with former Russian vice-president Aleksandr 
Rutskoy. According to Simes, during the meeting Rutskoy said 
that he wanted to run for presidency at the nearest presidential 
elections in Russia. 
  Simes pointed out that in a conversation with Nixon the 
former Russian vice-president said that he intends to carry out 
his political campaign by exclusively lawful means. 
  Simes went on to say that Nixon met with a high-ranking 
official of the State Duma and a representative of the Russian 
Government. He pointed out that the names of those who met with 
the U.S. ex-President would be kept secret at their own request. 
At the same time, Simes said that one of the anonymous 
high-ranking politicians who had asked for a meeting with the 
U.S. ex-President canceled the meeting, saying he was unwell. 
  Returning to the subject of Nixon's having been deprived of 
a 
limousine equipped with a special security system which had 
earlier been in his possession, Simes denied allegations that 
this had been done at the request of the U.S. ex-President's 
entourage. 
  Commenting on the situation around Nixon's visit to Russia, 
Simes declared that the trip turned out to be the best lesson 
for him. "This trip made me realise better than ever how 
decisions are adopted by the Russian Government and what 
relations exist between its constituent parts, how president's 
advisers are operating and what the relations are like between 
the president's entourage and the president himself and the 
State Duma and an extent to which lawmakers can afford to make 
independent decisions. All this was very useful to me," Simes 
said. 
  "The situation which unfolded is unwelcome, but it has 
taught 
us a good lesson, "making us a little bit wiser," Simes said.

  [Text] Moscow, 12 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin regards as closed the recent incident when he 
refused to receive the former U.S. President Richard Nixon who 
is on a private visit to Russia. ITAR-TASS learned this from an 
official source in the Kremlin, who also said that Yeltsin was 
in favor of Nixon holding meetings with representatives of 
different branches of power in Russia. However, the Russian 
president himself will still be unable to receive the former 
U.S. President because of the death of his wife's, Naina 
Yeltsina's, mother several days ago. 
  An ITAR-TASS correspondent has been told by Nixon's aides 
that U.S. President Bill Clinton and Robert Dole, the leader of 
the Republican group in the U.S. Senate and one of the most 
influential American legislators, approached the Russian head of 
state with requests to settle the complicated situation around 
this issue. 
  Representatives of Nixon have reported that on Monday [14 
March] he will make a speech at a sitting of the Russian State 
Duma Committee for International Affairs at the invitation of 
the committee's chairman Vladimir Lukin.

  [Text] Moscow March 14 TASS -- "Russia was and remains a 
great power and Russian-American relations are the most 
important for my country," ex-President Richard Nixon told 
members of the State Duma Committee for Foreign Affairs at a 
meeting here today. 
  The former U.S. president, who is visiting Moscow for the 
tenth time, noted that statements alleging that "America has 
triumphed over Russia" are a myth. Nixon also said that America 
jointly with Russia can cope with the global problems which 
"impose certain obligations on the two great powers." 
  Richard Nixon did not rule out the possibility of some 
frictions between the United States and Russia in the future but 
expressed confidence that "these will be differences between 
friends, not enemies." Nixon stressed the importance of open 
discussions of these differences. 
  Nixon described as "a positive phenomenon of the new time" 
the good personal relationship between Presidents Clinton and 
Yeltsin. 
  Along with this, Nixon sought to bring home to the Russian 
parliamentarians the concern felt by a part of American society 
about Russia's relapse to the aggressive policy. The 
ex-president said, "Russia is of course entitled to make its own 
steps in foreign policy, which do not always coincide with 
America's." 
  "We are now friends, so let us work together in order not to 
poison our relations," Nixon stressed. He pointed out the 
importance of strengthening cooperation between Russian and 
American parliamentarians.

  [Text] Washington March 11 TASS -- CIA Director James 
Woolsey announced on Thursday [10 March] that a commission of 
independent experts would be formed to look into the state of 
affairs in his agency's departments, which deal with 
counterespionage and inter-departmental security. The 
investigation's goal is to uncover the weaknesses in the 
organization of work and ensuring its secrecy in the light of 
the arrest of former-CIA official Aldrich Ames, who is now 
accused of working for Moscow for nine years. 
  Woolsey mentioned that, to head the commission, he would 
like 
to recruit former National Security Adviser under Bush's 
administration Brent Scowcroft, former secretary of defence 
under President Jimmy Carter Harold Brown, and the former head 
of the counter-espionage department in the FBI, Douglas Gow. 
The commission will also include current CIA officials. 
  Besides, Woolsey delclared, the CIA would also conduct an 
"independent and energetic" investigation into the Ames affair. 
This will be headed by Fred Hitz, the inspector general of the 
intelligence department. 
  Woolsey noted that the parallel investigations will be 
carried on without applying pressure on the on-going judicial 
investigation into the activity of Ames and his wife, who is 
also accused of espionage.

  [Text] Zagreb March 12 TASS -- Special envoy of the Russian 
president Vitaliy Churkin arrived here today to discuss with 
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman the situation in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and relations between Zagreb and Belgrade. 
  Commenting on the current Croatian-Serb relations at the 
Zagreb Airport, Churkin told ITAR-TASS "they are not as smooth 
as they could be. I will do my best to achieve any progress". 
  He said there are considerable obstacles on the way of 
post-Yugoslav settlement, but the sides must find a possibility 
to progress. 
  The London meeting with special envoy of the U.S. President 
on Bosnia Charles Redman on Friday resulted in mutual 
understanding and readiness for the most close cooperation in 
the conflict settlement, said Churkin. 
  On Sunday the official will meet leaders of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and Bosnian Serbs in Sarajevo and on Monday he will 
leave for Belgrade.

  [Text] Zagreb March 13 TASS -- Russian envoy and Deputy 
Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, who is currently on a 
mediation mission in former Yugoslavia, met on Sunday [13 March] 
with Bosnia's Muslim President Alija Izetbegovic, chief of the 
rebel Serbs' self-styled parliament Momcilo Krajisnik and the 
commander of U.N. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Commenting on the results of his trip, Churkin told TASS 
that 
these meeting had concentrated on Bosnian settlement, 
specifically the possibility of disengaging Croatian and Muslim 
forces. 
  As for Bosnia's territorial division and state arrangement, 
these issues need to be thoroughly examined, the Russian envoy 
noted. He is going to discuss them during Monday's meeting with 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. 
  Speaking about the Russian peacekeeping battalion deployed 
in 
Sarajevo, Churkin said neither the Muslim side nor the regional 
command of peacekeeping forces had any claims to it. The 
battalion is to be shortly reinforced with about one hundred 
extra fighters expected to arrive in Sarajevo in late March. 
  As for the current situation in the Bosnian capital, Churkin 
believes it has notably changed for the better. "For the first 
time over the past year, the situation here is close to normal. 
Moreover, Krajisnik has told me that Serbs and Muslim reached 
agreement on movement of civilians in Sarajevo and around it. 
This is a very important decision", Churkin stressed.

Russian foreign minister, who is on a mediatory trip to former

the outcome of his trip, the high-ranking Russian diplomat 
stated today in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent 
that at these meetings there was discussion of questions of a 
settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. "We are now working on the 
idea of extending the experience of disengagement of forces on 
the lines of confrontation of Croats and Muslims to the 
Serbian-Muslim front. Disengagement of Serbian and Muslim units 
could be started with Maglaj, where the situation is the most 
complex. If this can be achieved on the whole line of combat 
operations, the war in Bosnia will be practically ended," 
Vitaliy Churkin said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, 14 Mar -- I am satisfied that the Serb 
side is thinking positively with regard to what is happening in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, including using the idea of a 
Muslim-Croatian federation to advance a Bosnian settlement. 
This was stated by Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's 
special envoy and deputy minister of foreign affairs of Russia, 
following meetings today with Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic and members of the Bosnian Serb leadership. 
  The Russian diplomat said that several formulas for a future 
structure of Bosnia that takes account of the interests of all 
its three peoples are now being examined. Alongside the 
promising possibility of a Croatian-Muslim formation joining a 
confederation with Croatia, the possibility of the Bosnian Serbs 
joining a confederation with Yugoslavia is also a quite logical 
option. 
  Replying to a question about the possibility of the United 
States recognizing a Serb republic in Bosnia, Churkin said that 
the United States understands that when the sovereign rights of 
two peoples of Bosnia are recognized, the sovereign rights of 
the third -- the Serb people -- must also be recognized. I 
simply cannot see any arguments in favor of any other approach, 
he stressed. 
  Speaking about the most difficult problem of the Bosnian 
settlement -- the territorial demarcation of the communities, 
Churkin said that the new American approach does not envisage 
new territorial concessions by the Serbs. The previous 
proposals by the EU, with which the Serb side agreed, remain in 
force, he said.

Vladimir Mostovets] 
  [Text] Helsinki 11 Mar -- The heads of government of Russia 
and Finland, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Esko Aho, at the bilateral 
talks that took place between the government delegations, spoke 
of the necessity of drawing up measures to provide effective 
support at state level for practical cooperation between Russian 
and Finnish firms and enterprises in order to reinforce the 
upturn in trade that has been observed in the past year. The 
ITAR-TASS correspondents were told this and about the results of 
the talks by Valeriy Grishin, first deputy head of the Russian 
Federation Government press service. 
  Valeriy Grishin said that during the in-depth discussion of 
questions of Russian-Finnish relations it was remarked that 
there were no fundamental political problems between them. At 
the same time, it was noted that the considerable drop in the 
level of trade between Russia and Finland since the mid-1980s 
remained an object of concern to both sides, as the current 
level was far below the two countries' potential. V. 
Chernomyrdin noted in this connection that Russia regards 
Finland not only as a good neighbor but also a prospective 
partner, and he stressed that the Russian Federation Government 
will provide assistance to the Finns' aspirations not to give up 
the positions they have won in our market. 
  The two sides' delegations assessed the conclusion of an 
accord to make additional deliveries of Russian weaponry and 
special equipment in part payment as an important step toward 
resolving the acute problem of Russia's indebtedness. 
  There was also a detailed exchange of opinions around the 
problems of Russian and Finnish participation in the processes 
of European integration. The government heads are united in the 
view that the process of Russia's drawing closer to the European 
Union and Finland's entry into the European Union will take 
account of the interests of ensuring Russian-Finnish trade and 
economic links. V. Chernomyrdin stressed that Russia is in 
favor of strengthening regional cooperation in the Baltic 
region, moreover, he favors cooperation aimed not at exchanging 
statements about intentions but at achieving practical results. 
  Touching on the problems of relations between Russia and the 
Baltic countries, the head of the Russian cabinet noted that our 
country continues to be seriously concerned over the position of 
the Russian-speaking population in Latvia and Estonia. He also 
pointed out that Tallinn and Riga were not prepared to heed the 
recommendations from human rights organizations and experts from 
the CSCE and European Union in the human rights sphere. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin invited Esko Aho to pay an official 
visit 
to Russia.

Vladimir Mostovets] 
  [Text] Helsinki, 11 Mar -- Russia does not intend to adopt 
sanctions of any kind against the Baltic countries, or does it 
intend to keep its troops in them. Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin stated this at a short news conference on 
the results of Russian-Finnish intergovernmental talks held 
today. 
  Answering journalists' questions, he stressed that the 
Russian leadership "is not considering imposing sanctions" 
against Estonia, Latvia, or Lithuania. 
  At the same time, he stated emotionally that these countries 
should fulfil their obligations to observe the human rights of 
all people, without exception, living on their territories. "We 
will not allow Russians in the Baltic countries who were born 
and who have grown up there to be treated in the future as they 
are being treated now. After all, we do not set any conditions 
for Estonians, Latvians, or Lithuanians living in Russia," he 
stressed. 
  The head of the Russian Government categorically rejected 
the 
presence of a "territorial problem" in Russo-Finnish relations. 
He stressed that Russia would like to have "transparent" 
borders with Finland, and a number of intergovernmental 
agreements signed today are aimed toward this. "We are not 
thinking about how to redraw the borders, but about simplifying 
the mechanism for trade in border areas, and about creating free 
economic zones," he added. 
  Chernomyrdin believes that the accords reached today between 
Russia and Finland lay the foundation for increasing trade and 
economic cooperation. Expressing his concern at the significant 
reduction in the trade balance between the two countries in the 
last five years, the premier said that Russia and Finland now 
have every opportunity not only to equal the balance figures of 
the mid-1980s, but also to surpass them. 
  Answering questions from Finnish journalists, the chairman 
of 
the government stressed that Russia intends to pay off gradually 
its existing debts to Finland, partly with arms deliveries. 
Esko Aho, who also took part in the news conference, noted in 
this connection that this is a "reasonable" approach. "We could 
consider the possibilities of paying off some debts not only 
with deliveries of Russian military equipment, but with other 
goods as well."

intergovernmental talks held today in the Finnish capital and 
attended by Prime Ministers Viktor Chernomyrdin and Esko Aho, a 
hefty package of documents has been signed between the 
governments of the two countries. These mainly relate to 
economic cooperation. 
  This package includes intergovernmental agreements on 
Russo-Finnish state border checkpoints, on cooperation and 
mutual assistance in customs affairs, in the area of fishing, on 
cooperation in the area of postal and electronic communications, 
on the cancellation of the Russian Federation's debt to the 
Finnish Republic through deliveries of special stock, and a 
memorandum on cooperation between the customs services of the 
two countries in the fight against the smuggling of radioactive 
materials. Also, as a result of the talks, a number of secret 
documents specifying the volumes and delivery mechanism for 
Russian arms as part of the cancellation of Russia's debt have 
been approved. Andrey Vavilov, first deputy finance minister of 
the Russian Federation told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that 
Russia would deliver modern weapons systems worth $80 million 
toward the cancellation of its debt. Among these would be 
anti-aircraft and artillery systems.

  [Text] Both Imatran Voima [IVO, power company] and Neste 
[oil and gas company] have today signed significant energy 
agreements while the visit of Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin continues in Helsinki. A subsidiary of Imatran 
Voima, IVO International, signed a general agreement worth 
almost 1 billion Finnish Markkas, which includes the 
modernization of several power plants in Russia, especially in 
the area of St. Petersburg. The main emphasis of the agreement 
is on modernizing the power plants, protecting the environment, 
and saving energy. Some of the projects will be financed by 
selling the saved energy to Finland. 
  The Russian natural gas company Gazprom will, for its part, 
become a partner with a 25 percent share in a natural gas 
company, which will remain a subsidiary of the Neste concern. 
In addition, a new 20 year-old agreement on supplying natural 
gas was signed. This agreement will increase the imports of 
natural gas from the current 2.9 billion cubic meters to more 
than 4 billion cubic meters by the end of the decade. The 
increase in the imports of natural gas will make the extension 
of the natural gas network in Finland possible. Neste reports 
that industry especially and the producers of heating in heavily 
populated areas are interested in increasing the use of natural 
gas. 
  At the end of his official visit to Finland, Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin will have a 24-hour holiday in Lapland. 
Chernomyrdin and his small retinue will fly to Kittilae [north 
western Lapland] by special flight. The hosts of Prime Minister 
and Madame Chernomyrdin's day in Lapland are Prime Minister Esko 
Aho and Madame Kirsti Aho. Chernomyrdin will fly directly from 
Kittilae to Moscow tomorrow afternoon.

  [Excerpts] Helsinki, 11 Mar -- As a result of 
intergovernmental talks held today in the Finnish capital and 
attended by Prime Ministers Viktor Chernomyrdin and Esko Aho, a 
hefty package of documents was signed, mainly concerning 
economic interaction between the two countries. [passage omitted] 
  According to the intergovernmental agreement on checkpoints 
on the Russo-Finnish border, besides the five checkpoints open 
for international road and rail transport, it has been decided 
to create a system of open temporary checkpoints on the border 
between the two countries for exclusively Finnish and Russian 
means of transport. This measure is aimed at developing border 
cooperation and simplifying the transportation of timber and the 
conducting of other economic activity. 
  The agreement on cooperation and mutual aid in customs 
matters replaces the 1975 Soviet-Finnish agreement in effect 
until now. It contains a mechanism for implementing customs 
cooperation, and clauses on the prevention of violations and 
mutual assistance in investigating them. The document specially 
stipulates measures to facilitate customs procedures, and also 
to prevent illegal transportation across the border of weapons, 
strategically important goods and cargoes endangering human 
health or the environment. 
  The agreement in the fishing sphere also replaces an earlier 
and similar agreement between Finland and the USSR signed in 
1981. This is a conventional outline treaty for regulating 
fishing, on the basis of which plenipotentiary authorities from 
both sides can agree annually on quotas for species of fish, 
fishing zones and boats having the right to fish. 
  The agreement signed today on cooperation in the sphere of 
postal and electronic communications is intended to aid the 
development of postal communications between Russia and Finland. 
It is an outline agreement, replacing a similar document which 
the USSR concluded with Finland nine years ago. 
  The agreement on paying off the Russian Federation's debts 
to 
the Republic of Finland with supplies of special property 
determines the procedure for paying off Russian debts to the 
Bank of Finland with supplies of weapons and equipment. At 
present Russia's total debt to Finland amounts to $1.3 billion.

  [Text] Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of the Russian Government, 
ends his visit to Finland today. Touching upon Russia's 
relations with the Baltic countries at the concluding news 
conference in Helsinki, he expressed anxiety concerning the 
situation of the Russophone population in Lithuania, Latvia, and 
Estonia. Russia, said Chernomyrdin, does not intend to impose 
any kind of sanctions against the Baltic countries and does not 
intend to keep troops there, but these countries must observe 
human rights.

  [Text] The Black Sea Fleet considers itself a Russian one 
and it must become Russian Fleet, commander-in-chief of Russia's 
Navy Felix Gromov declared at a press conference on Saturday [12 
March] in St. Petersburg. 
  He underlined that the fate of the Black Sea Fleet should be 
solved in accordance with the agreement between Russian and 
Ukrainian presidents "according to which, the Fleet should be 
transferred to Russia." 
  Gromov negatively assessed attempts of the Ukrainian party 
to 
drag out the process of the Fleet's transfer, and, in 
particular, the proposal to make an inventory of the Fleet's 
property. 
  According to Gromov, Russian Navy plans to receive new ships 
from the industry, "We need a fleet which corresponds to 
Russia's economy and is able to fulfill tasks related to border 
guarding," stressed Gromov. 
  He also reported that the heavy atomic missile cruiser Petr 
Velikiy under construction at the Baltiyskiy factory in St. 
Petersburg is almost ready and will be put into operation soon. 
The crew has already arrived in St. Petersburg; the cruiser is 
to enter composition of the Pacific Fleet.

  [Text] Russia will endure Ukraine's debt for fuel and 
energy and its syphoning off of gas till April, Chairman of 
Russian government Viktor Chernomyrdin declared on Saturday in 
Helsinki after the signing of an agreement between the joint 
stock company Gazprom and Finnish company Neste. 
  During his conversation with journalists Chernomyrdin 
pointed 
out that as of today Ukraine's debt to Russia for fuel and 
energy is about $1 Bn [Billion]. To this effect Chernomyrdin 
expressed his concern over this fact. "We make many concessions 
and await that Ukraine's leadership will start to act but not to 
talk," he said. According to Chernomyrdin, other consumers of 
Russian natural gas suffer because of Ukraine's debt. 
  Meanwhile, Chairman of Gazprom's board Rem Vyakhirev 
declared 
in his interview with Interfax that if Ukraine fails to fulfill 
the agreement signed on March 10 in Moscow then Russian 
deliveries for the republic's inner consumption will be entirely 
stopped. He underlined that this issue would be finally solved 
before April 11, the time of the next talks on Ukraine's debt 
for fuel and energy delivered from Russia. 
  On Saturday in Helsinki, Vyakhirev signed two agreements 
with 
the leadership of the firm Neste, on deliveries of Russian gas 
to Finland for the next twenty years and on procurement of 
25% 
of shares of the Finnish gas company by Gazprom. 
  In Vyakhirev's words, the document stipulates that in 1994 
Russia is due to supply 3.2 Bn cubic meters of natural gas to 
Finland. 
  In the course of his visit to Finland Chernomyrdin signed 
several bilateral economic agreements and a document on 
deliveries of Russian armaments to this country. 
  Viktor Samoylov, general director of the state company on 
armaments and military equipment export and import 
Rosvooruzhenie, reported to Interfax that Russia would deliver 
to Finland armaments amounting to $100 Mn [Million] to 
compensate its foreign debt. As he said, these are air defense 
weapons, spare parts for military equipment, ammunitions for 
artillery, and small arms. 
  Samoylov pointed out that Russia sells weapons to Finland 
since 1959. 
  Russia's debt to Finland is $1.3 Bn.

  [Text] Moscow March 14 TASS -- While Russian gas supplies 
to Ukraine have stabilised, the volume of gas deliveries to 
neighbouring Belarus has dropped by ten million cubic meters 
since the beginning of March. 
  "Ukraine has pledged to pay 100 million U.S. dollars by the 
end of March as part of its debt which amounts to about 1.3 
trillion roubles," Vladimir Podmarkov, chief engineer of 
Russia's Gazprom gas concern, said on Monday. 
  Russia and Ukraine agreed in Moscow on March 10 that Ukraine 
will pay 50 per cent of its debt for 1993 with financial means, 
including hard currency, and the rest with equipment and 
materials for Gazprom. The debt for the first quarter of 1994 
will be paid only with financial means. Russia resumed gas 
supplies to Ukraine, following the agreement. Presently, it 
pumps 195 million cubic meters of gas daily to Ukraine. 
  As for Belarus, its debt for Russian gas supplies has 
totalled about 400 billion roubles. It has failed to make the 
promised payments so far. In retaliation, Russia has cut gas 
supplies to that republic. Podmarkov said Russian gas supplies 
to Moldova and the Baltic states are within the agreed limits.

  [Text] Russia believes that its troops will be the backbone 
of the UN peacekeeping force "if and when the decision on their 
deployment in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict is 
taken," a high-ranking diplomat in the Russian Foreign Ministry 
in charge of these problems told Interfax. 
  He said "there is nothing new" in the proposals made by the 
Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze in Washington. "The leaders 
of Russia, Georgia and Abkhazia have already asked the UN to 
send a peacekeeping force to the conflict zone. The question is 
that Georgians would like to have them deployed along the Psou 
River, while Abkhazians would like to have them along the Inguri 
River. However, the UN is not hurrying to take a decision, he 
said. "The opponents of giving the Russian troops the status of 
a UN peacekeeping force insist that such a decision should be 
preceded by certain progress in a political settlement of the 
conflict," he noted. 
  The diplomat pointed out that Moscow continues to adhere to 
another approach. "We think that the sooner the UN takes a 
corresponding decision, the sooner the Georgian-Abkhazian 
conflict is settled," he said.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS correspondents Leonid Vorontsov and Aleksey </F>
Korinenko] 
  [Excerpts] Berlin, 11 Mar -- The leaders of the military 
departments of the FRG and Russia called the visit to the FRG by 
Defense Minister General Pavel Grachev "very successful and 
friendly." [passage omitted] 
  During the visit, a joint statement was signed in which the 
sides called good relations between Russia and Germany a most 
important factor of stability and security in Europe. Protocols 
on mutual exchange in training soldiers and officers and on 
cooperation in the sphere of environmental conservation were 
also signed during the visit. [passage omitted] 
  German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe stressed, in 
particular, 
the importance of Russia participating in the Partnership for 
Peace [PFP] program. He called Russia a most important partner 
of NATO's. Pavel Grachev, in his turn, stated that he regards 
this program as a document for the transitional period. "This 
period began with the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and will end 
when the countries which belonged to it, and also the states 
formed in place of the Soviet Union, find their place in the 
world community," he said, in reply to a question from an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent. "They should become independent 
states, both in economic and political terms, carrying out a 
course for democracy, peace, and cooperation." 
  Speaking of the role of NATO in the system of European 
security, P. Grachev noted that it was not just the North 
Atlantic alliance which should take part in it, but also all 
international organizations on the continent -- the CSCE, the 
North Atlantic Cooperation Council, the European Union, and the 
West European Union. The main role here, however, should belong 
to "the main peace-keeping organization" -- the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe. He did not exclude NATO's 
integration into the common European process right up to this 
organization being transformed into a unified structure. "Time 
will tell what this structure will be like," P.Grachev said. He 
spoke out in favor of Russia's cooperation with the North 
Atlantic bloc and for its integration into it. 
  Touching upon the intention of a number of East European 
states to join NATO, the Russian minister stated: "We will not 
foist our will upon other states. We do not have the right to 
do that, but we would like to see on their part the desire to 
cooperate with NATO and not to be integrated into it." 
  Having noted that the final decision on the ceremony to see 
off the ally's troops from Berlin would be taken at the highest 
political level, both ministers stressed that this should happen 
in a "worthy manner." "We would like to leave Germany as 
friends," P. Grachev said, "all the more so since the Western 
Group of Forces have formed good relations with the German 
side." Volker Ruehe in his turn said, in reply to an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent's question, that he would like to see every 
Russian soldier returning home as an ambassador of Germany's. 
The date for the completion of the withdrawal of troops, 
should, in his opinion, not just remind one of the past but also 
allow one to take a look into the future where cooperation 
between the two countries will be developed anew. 
  In Berlin, Pavel Grachev and Volker Ruehe laid wreathes at 
the memorial in Tiergarten to Soviet soldiers and at the 
memorial to those who tried to assassinate Hitler on 20 July 
1944. 
  Having ended his official visit to Germany, Pavel Grachev 
will spend another two days on German soil. He will hold 
meetings with the command and men of the Western Group of Forces.

  [Excerpts] Berlin, 13 Mar -- Russian Defense Minister 
General Pavel Grachev ended a five-day visit to Germany today. 
[passage omitted] 
  A chance is at hand, which under no circumstances must be 
let 
slip, the Russian minister said, appearing before the press. 
This is a chance to considerably improve bilateral relations in 
all areas. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking to journalists in Berlin, Grachev stressed that the 
fundamental role in the system of European security should 
belong to the "main peacemaking organization" -- the Conference 
on Security and Cooperation in Europe. He did not rule out NATO 
being integrated into the common European process right through 
to the transformation of that organization into a single 
structure. [sentence as heard] Time will show what kind of 
structure that will be, Grachev said, calling for cooperation 
between Russia and the North Atlantic bloc but not for 
integration into it. 
  After noting that a final decision on the parting ceremony 
for the allied troops leaving Berlin would be taken at the 
highest political level, both ministers stressed that it would 
have to proceed in a fitting manner. We would like to leave 
Germany as friends, Grachev said, all the more so since good 
relations have arisen between the Western Group of Forces and 
the German side. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Igor Yavlyanskiy report: "Will They Play the `Slav Woman's </F>
Farewell' in Berlin?"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Three Russian officers will become students 
at the Bundeswehr Academy in Hamburg this year. And a German 
colleague will be attending the General Staff Academy in Moscow. 
Russian and German warships will soon be holding joint maneuvers 
in the Baltic, and next year the first Russo-German command post 
exercises will be held in Russia. This was stated at a Bonn 
press conference by Grachev and Ruehe, heads of the Russian and 
FRG military departments. The Russian defense minister also 
announced that a department to retrain officers released to the 
reserve as a result of cutbacks will open in Moscow at the end 
of the month. 
  Pavel Grachev made a high assessment of the level of 
relations between the two countries' military departments. He 
stressed that it would be a good idea if other states (the hint 
was clearly addressed to the Baltic republics) were to learn how 
to organize the Russian troop withdrawal from their territories 
in a civilized way. 
  One other as it were "ceremonial" issue is still under 
discussion -- how to hold the farewell parade of Russian troops 
in Berlin 3 August this year to mark the end of their withdrawal 
from German territory. Certain Bonn politicians (Foreign 
Minister Kinkel, for instance) are suggesting that the 
expediency of holding this ceremony depends on the development 
of the situation with the Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia 
and Estonia. On this issue Grachev showed typically military 
resolve -- whether there is a parade or not is up to Yeltsin and 
Kohl, nobody else. 
  He was equally clear-cut in answering a question about the 
future of the 81,000 tonnes of Russian munitions which, in the 
German side's opinion, are liable to be left on German 
territory: "You can quote me in your newspapers that all 
munitions will have been withdrawn from the FRG to Russia by the 
end of this May."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Olga Semenova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 11 TASS -- The arrest of a Russian 
citizen accused of spying for Germany has been confirmed only 
very unwillingly by official representatives of either side 
involved. The reason does not lie in the Russian 
Counter-Espionage Service's modest desire to keep quiet about 
another success or in the German service's silent mourning of an 
agent. 
  There are many reasons, but the main one is that both 
agencies have agreed not to "hand their dirty linen out" for the 
whole world to see. This is not surprising, especially 
considering the fact that the matter concerns not only 
professional secrets, but the observance of human rights as 
well. Only a court can determine a person's guilt. To guard 
the suspect's rights both sides are covering up his name and the 
circumstances of his arrest. 
  The investigation is still going on, and it would be better 
if the matter was not made public at all. Apparently, the 
Counter-Espionage Service has yet to uncover the source of the 
leak about the arrest. A babble-mouth is truly a great find for 
a spy. 
  Having received a very sketchy confirmation of the incident 
from Moscow, journalists bombarded official representative of 
the German Government Dietier Vogel with questions. He stated 
that Bernd Schmidbauer, Helmut Kohl's top aide on intelligence 
issues, had a phone conversation with the head of Russia's 
Counter-Espionage Service. Vogel declared that the two sides 
"are not attaching a lot of importance to this incident, and it 
will not have any effect on the political relationship" between 
Russia and Germany. 
  The questions opened up by such events should be answered 
only by the intelligence officials of the two countries, the 
chancellor's representative explained. "The truth is, that 
intelligence operations are carried out all over the world, and 
they do not have particular political significance", he noted. 
  "Besides, the Russian and German espionage agencies 
cooperate 
with each other to some extent. The Germans have their 
intelligence mission in Russia, and the Russians, the former 
KGB, have one in Bonn. They are, so to speak, officially 
accredited. The two sides cooperate closely in many spheres, in 
particular, in the fight against terrorism and organized crime", 
he said.

  [Text] Moscow March 11 TASS -- The recent arrest of a 
Russian citizen on charges of spying for Germany was a key issue 
of a telephone conversation between Sergey Stepashin, head of 
the Russian Federal Counter-Intelligence service (FCS), and 
German State Minister Bernd Schmidbauer on Friday [11 March], a 
spokesman for the Russian Counter-Intelligence Service told 
ITAR-TASS. 
  Aleksandr Mikhailov, the FCS spokesman, said that "the 
conversation was of a professional character". 
  The arrest was earlier officially confirmed by the agency. 
  According to Mikhailov, "the arrest has no political 
bearing". The detainment of the German agent was the result of 
counter-intelligence activities aimed at securing Russia's state 
interests", he said.

  [Text] A news conference held today at the premises of the 
Rosvooruzheniye [Russian weapons] state company was devoted to 
matters relating to the arms trade. Our correspondent Marina 
Chernukha has the details. 
  [Chernukha] Lieutenant General Viktor Samoylov, the 
company's 
director general, anticipated many of the journalists' questions 
by stating that Russia unequivocally intends to defend its 
position on the world arms market. 
  [Begin Samoylov recording] Regarding the trade in arms, yes, 
we are going to fight, and we are already fighting on the 
market. We have the advantage of not having lost our old 
markets. We still have them. We are hoping for new markets as 
well -- primarily the Pacific and Asian, the Latin American, 
which we are beginning to penetrate, and also South Africa, 
where we are already established normally. [end recording] 
  [Chernukha] Samoylov stressed that Russia does not intend to 
act in contravention of UN sanctions regarding trade with Iraq 
and Libya. However, he made it clear that as soon as these are 
lifted, Russia could offer these countries competitive military 
equipment and armaments.

  [Text] Warsaw, 12 Mar -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the leader 
of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) arrived in the 
Polish capital late on Friday [11 March] evening in "an 
atmosphere of adventure," as a commentator on Warsaw radio 
nighttime news put it. Alongside the leaders of the Samoobrona 
National Front, which invited him to its first congress, waiting 
for Zhirinovskiy at Warsaw's Okecie Airport were a group of 
young people described by commentators as belonging to an 
"antifascist organization" of the capital's university. 
  As Zhirinovskiy left the airport terminal, these young 
people 
joined the rush of reporters towards him, shouting "Black Pig," 
"Go Away," and "Get out of Poland." Uniformed men of the 
so-called Polish legion, Samoobrona's youth organization, their 
faces concealed by their caps, leapt to the defense of their 
guest. A police squad had to wield truncheons to break up the 
melee. 
  Reporters involved in the scuffle, some of them tenderly 
touched by the truncheons, made indignant mention in their 
dispatches of the tough conduct of the squad that dispersed 
them. However, they were unable to find out from the airport 
authorities to which police unit it belonged. 
  Reporters also noticed that for three quarters of an hour, 
border guards failed to let Zhirinovskiy and those with him 
through. The guards claim that this was because their guest's 
bodyguards had no visas, although Poland and Russia are known to 
operate an agreement on visa-free travel. 
  The arrival of the LDPR leader was preceded by an 
unprecedented campaign in the Polish press and political 
circles. Calls to ban him from entering the country were voiced 
even in the Polish Sejm, on Friday. A special opinion poll was 
published here on the eve of Zhirinovskiy's arrival. According 
to its authors, 66 percent of Poles believe that the LDPR leader 
"is a threat to Poland."

  [Text] Tokyo, 11 Mar -- Russian and the G-7 countries plan 
to adopt a common political declaration at the Naples meeting in 
July of the leaders of the seven leading industrial countries of 
the world, in which Russian President Boris Yeltsin is again to 
take part. This was stated by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Sergey Lavrov, who is here in Tokyo, in an interview to an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent. "The adoption of a joint declaration 
by the G-7 countries and Russia marks in effect the 
transformation of the Group of Seven into a "political eight," 
he said. 
  The deputy minister said that even before the previous 
meeting of the G-7 leaders in Tokyo last summer, Moscow proposed 
that Russia participate fully in the political part of the 
discussions at the meeting and that a common "declaration of the 
eight leaders" be adopted on its results. However, because 
there was not enough time to prepare a new formula for Russian 
participation in the G-7 conference, it was decided to turn down 
this plan. 
  "This time, however, prior to the Naples meeting, Russia 
submitted this proposal in good time, and it has has been 
supported on the whole by the G-7 countries; we hope that the 
Naples conference will be a step forward compared with the 
previous meetings of President Boris Yeltsin and the G-7 leaders 
and will demonstrate the readiness of the G-7 and Russia to 
cooperate in resolving international political problems as a 
Group of Eight," Sergey Lavrov said. He stressed: "We believe 
that Russia, as one of the world's leading powers, without whose 
participation it is difficult to resolve many international 
problems, should be more actively drawn into the activity of the 
G-7 than it is at present." 
  The deputy head of the Russian Foreign Ministry pointed out 
that it was a question of closer cooperation between Russia and 
the G-7 exclusively in the sphere of politics. In the sphere of 
economics, Russia, which is now implementing economic reforms, 
is hardly ready to become a full participant in the work of the 
Group of Seven. "But in the political sphere, closer cooperation 
between us is quite possible," Sergey Lavrov said. "The 
political declaration adopted at the meeting of the G-7 leaders 
in Tokyo, for example, does not contain a single question that 
would not be of direct interest to Russia and in whose tackling 
our country in one way or another would not be involved."

  [Excerpts] Tokyo, 12 Mar -- Aleksandr Rodin, first deputy 
head of the Russian Federation fisheries committee, who headed 
the Russian delegation at the two-week-long Russian-Japanese 
talks on salmon fishing which ended in Tokyo today, said the 
results of the talks met Russia's national interests. He told 
an ITAR-TASS correspondent that an agreement had been reached to 
cut the catch of salmon by Japan in Russia's economic zone by 
1,000 tons as against last year's catch and to keep the size of 
the catch in Japanese waters of salmon from Russia at the same 
level as last year's. 
  This means that this year Japanese fishermen have the right 
to catch no more than 14,000 tons of Russian river salmon inside 
the Russian economic zone and no more that 4,800 tons in 
Japanese waters. [passage omitted] 
  The head of the Russian delegation said that the decision 
was 
also made at the talks that Japan, as before, would compensate 
Russia for some of its expenditure on scientific research on 
salmon, on breeding and protecting them. [passage omitted] 
  The first deputy head of the fisheries committee noted that 
the results of the talks in Tokyo would in no way have a 
negative influence upon Russia's salmon supply. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Moldovan President Mircea Snegur left today for an 
official visit to Brussels, where he will sign the general 
documents on Moldova's adherence to Partnership for Peace. 
  Just before leaving, President Mircea Snegur made the 
following statement to the correspondents: 
  [Begin Snegur recording] This visit to Belgium is part of 
our foreign political activity, belonging among the events 
scheduled to take place in 1994. Its main goal is to sign the 
Partnership for Peace plan, since that partnership ensures 
security and stability in Europe within the new circumstances 
that emerged after the collapse of the socialist bloc and the 
Soviet Union. Moldova is a small and peaceful country that does 
not represent any danger whatsoever for anyone. Moreover, as 
you may know, the people have decided [in the 6 March public 
opinion poll] that we should promote a policy of neutrality; 
therefore, we need certain guarantees, and such guarantees are 
offered to us by Partnership for Peace. 
  In the same context, a meeting is scheduled to take place at 
the headquarters of the Western European Union [WEU] to discuss 
the same issues of security and cooperation in Europe. 
  We consider our meeting at the European Union headquarters 
as 
very important because we want to conclude a partnership and 
cooperation accord with that economic union. Negotiations will 
be initiated as soon as possible; thus, it is necessary to pay a 
visit to the European Union. 
  Finally, we will approach aspects of our bilateral relations 
with Belgium because we need to discuss the bilateral documents 
that are being prepared for signing. 
  Thus, my three-day visit will actually consist of a one-day 
visit to Belgium, another day will be consecrated to NATO in 
view of the Partnership for Peace plan, and the third one to my 
talks at the European Union. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Opening statement at news conference by Ukrainian President </F>
Leonid Krachuk in Kiev on 11 March -- live] 
  [Text] [Unidentified moderator] Ladies and gentlemen, I 
have the honor to open this news conference by President Leonid 
Makarovych Kravchuk on the results of his official visit to the 
United States from 3 to 7 March. Before he answers your 
questions, Leonid Makarovych wishes to make an introductory 
address. 
  [Kravchuk] First of all, I can only focus attention on 
certain fundamental issues because the visit was basically 
covered both in our and foreign media, and its results were 
outlined in the news conference by the Presidents of the United 
States and Ukraine, as well as at the summing-up news conference 
in New York. But I suppose there is a need to draw attention to 
certain issues. 
  I think this visit -- this official visit, as it is 
described 
in the media as well as in the United States and Ukrainian 
protocols, although there were attempts to call it a working 
visit, depending on whose definition it is, and according to the 
protocol definition it is an official visit by the president of 
Ukraine to the United States -- is a logical conclusion to a 
rather important stage in the ongoing process of forming the 
political and the legal-contractual foundations of inter-state 
relations between the United States and Ukraine. I believe this 
visit took place in an atmosphere of notable positive 
breakthroughs in Washington's lengthy but active rethinking of 
its concept regarding relations with Ukraine. It allowed us to 
proceed to the more substantive practical implementation of the 
democratic partnership proclaimed during the visit in May 1992, 
and to fill it with more specific content. 
  The talks and negotiations that were held with President 
Clinton, Vice President Gore, Secretary of State Christopher, 
Secretary of Defense Perry, the heads of the Departments of 
Finance and Trade, and with other top officials of the U.S. 
administration, as well as in the Congress and at the Pentagon, 
proved that the relations between our countries are ascending to 
a qualitatively new level. There has been a change in relations 
between the United States and Ukraine to relations between two 
friendly countries called to play an important role, a strategic 
role, at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. In any event 
Ukraine's role is thus evaluated in the long- term strategic 
political plans of the United States, as I understood it. 
  Of no less importance is the implementation of our approach 
to balancing the context of bilateral relations by displacing -- 
this is very important -- the accent from the problems of 
Ukraine's nuclear (?armament) to other spheres of cooperation. 
The fact that the American side has adopted namely such a 
course confirms the correctness of our principled position from 
this aspect, too. 
  The signing of a whole package of interstate documents 
during 
the visit, which determine the fundamental principles and 
directions of bilateral relations for the nearest future in 
political, economic, scientific-technical, and cultural spheres, 
creates an important basis for giving Ukrainian-American 
cooperation more substance and a more mutually advantageous 
direction. 
  If one is to take the most important political result of the 
visit, one may consider, first, the fact that the United States 
unreservedly -- and this is very important -- confirmed support 
for Ukraine's striving to consolidate its political and economic 
independence, and the greater awareness of the potentially 
increasing role of Ukraine in the development of evolutionary 
social and political processes, both in the CIS region and in 
Europe as a whole. 
  Next, the United States has realized to a greater degree the 
existence of a stable, economically strong, and democratic 
Ukrainian state, that its territorial integrity and security 
conform to the interests of the United States, and that 
Ukraine's loss of political independence could upset the 
existing strategic balance in Europe and the entire world, 
leading to unpredictable consequences. Thus, we can say that in 
the period since 1991 certain strategic balances have taken 
shape in Europe, and any unexpected development in any state, 
first of all a state like Ukraine as our primary concern, could 
lead to an imbalance. This is being increasingly realized both 
in the United States and in Europe. 
  Next, the United States has expressed readiness to grant 
additional financial aid to Ukraine. You know the figures. 
However, it is important for me to emphasize one aspect, namely 
that the United States has assumed a leading role in the 
mobilization of additional multilateral aid within the framework 
of the G-7 in order to support the reform program in Ukraine. 
This was mentioned by the President of the United States. 
  Another very important aspect is that we have agreed to work 
on the removal of barriers to trade and investments in order to 
enlarge access to the two countries' markets. In March, the 
benefits within the Generalized System of Preferences will be 
extended to Ukraine, which will open opportunities for more 
active access to the U.S. commodity market. Incidentally, today 
I met representatives of the European Union and we also 
suggested that the European market and the European Union 
consider Ukraine's proposals to this effect after Ukraine signs, 
soon I hope, the partnership and cooperation agreement with the 
European Union, which is to be initialled in the near future, 
some time in March. 
  We also reached an agreement, and I attach great importance 
to this, about attracting more active private investment to 
Ukraine. I held meetings at the Overseas Private Investment 
Corporation in the United States with representatives of large 
companies in New York, and I can tell you that the emphasis was 
on the United States' economic aid to Ukraine and support for 
private companies' capital investments in Ukraine, given of 
course certain legislative support on the part of Ukraine. The 
results of the visit also create real opportunities for the 
establishment of mutually beneficial bilateral cooperation in 
the sphere of science and technology and joint space research. 
There are relevant agreements on all of these issues. 
  If one looks at it from the summing-up point of view, one 
can say that there are considerable positive breakthroughs both 
in Washington's philosophy and conceptual approaches toward the 
establishment of relations between the United States and 
Ukraine, in terms of pursuing a more balanced and realistic 
policy that will embrace political, economic, scientific, 
technical, and humanitarian cooperation, that is, practically 
all areas. One can state already now that the crucial factor in 
these breakthroughs was Ukraine's consistent, moderate, and 
balanced stance in the rather intensive political dialogue at 
all levels, both with the United States and with Russia, which 
made it possible to sign the trilateral statement called to 
maintain the necessary balance in relations between the United 
States, Russia, and Ukraine. I think it has become clear to 
all that the signing of the trilateral agreement was a decisive 
stage in the present development of relations between Ukraine 
and the United States, and between Ukraine and Russia. 
  The visit made it possible to consolidate the positive 
trends 
that had begun to take tangible shape in the bilateral relations 
and channel them in a direction more consistent with our 
political and economic priorities. I believe they are also 
consistent with the aims of both the Western states and Russia. 
  The present steps of the Ukrainian Government must be aimed 
at working out as soon as possible all the mechanisms regarding 
the solving and implementation of the problems and agreements 
that were signed. First of all, we need to ratify two 
documents, one is the agreement on encouragement and mutual 
protection of investments, and the other is the convention on 
the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of tax evasion 
in respect of income and capital tax. These documents must be 
ratified. 
  It is very important to resolve, within the shortest 
possible 
period of time, and we are working on it now, the issue of 
setting up a bilateral commission for assistance to trade and 
investment that we agreed to form, and a commission for 
assistance to joint activities in the sphere of high technology, 
scientific research, and development. We have instructed our 
National Space Agency to hold, in the near future, a meeting of 
the two countries' experts to examine specific issues and 
spheres of cooperation in space research in order to sign a 
respective intergovernmental agreement. 
  The work conducted during and before the visit with 
international financial organizations, particularly, the 
International Monetary Fund and World Bank, was very important. 
This work is now at the completion stage, its specific sections 
have been worked out, and now the entire program must be 
finalized. It is a program based on Ukraine's real 
possibilities, and on our political will to pursue consistent 
market economic reforms which is our most important task and to 
which we see no alternative today. We have instructed our 
Foreign Affairs Ministry to continue consultations with the 
United States and other G-7 countries in order to mobilize 
international financial aid to speed up the economic processes 
and reforms in Ukraine that are taking place and should be more 
intensive. 
  Thus, one can say without exaggeration that the official 
visit by the president of Ukraine and the Ukrainian delegation 
to the United States is a very important stage in the 
development of bilateral and multilateral relations, and in 
determining a more clear political role for Ukraine as a 
European state. I think this visit will enable us to place the 
right emphasis in our relations, our policy, and our 
perspective. I am now ready to answer your questions.

  [Text] The Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze told 
INTERFAX that he had reached an understanding with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton "on all major issues, notably the sending 
of international peace keeping forces to Abkhazia." 
  "A decision to this effect, which will not be easy to 
materialize, has to be made by the UN Security Council and have 
proper financing backing," Shevardnadze said. In his words, the 
financing issue was solved to all practical purposes during his 
visit. "I have assurances from both the President and Congress," 
he emphasized. 
  Shevardnadze said that "the proposal that international 
peace 
keeping units be sent was supported by nearly every member of 
the UN Security Council." 
  According to Shevardnadze, the Security Council session at 
which he "outlined what had happened in Abkhazia, the causes and 
consequences of those events and the situation there now" showed 
understanding and denounced separatist extremism, fascism and 
genocide of the Georgian population. "The Russian, U.S., 
British, Chinese, French and other ambassadors to the UN 
Security Council gave their full support to the policy pursued 
by Georgia for the resolution of the conflict and for 
territorial unity and sovereignty of Georgia," Shevardnadze 
emphasized. 
  Shevardnadze said the Security Council resolution on the 
sending of peace keeping troops, expected to be passed on March 
21, would become "an important, if not decisive, contribution to 
the resolution of the Abkhazian crisis and so to neutralization 
of a source of larger danger. ...It is essential that this 
action be taken under UN auspices." 
  Shevardnadze thought that his visit to the U.S. and UN "was 
a 
major step" towards resolving the Abkhazian conflict. 
  Shevardnadze's interview is published in full in INTERFAX's 
Monday edition of the Presidential Bulletin.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Andrey Shishov: "Nizhniy Novgorod </F>
Inhabitants Share Experience"] 
  [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod -- The Nizhniy Novgorod model for 
transforming the Russian countryside should become a national 
program for the resurrection of the Russian peasantry. This was 
stated by Viktor Chernomyrdin, prime minister of the Russian 
Federation Government, at a conference of heads of 
administration of the components of the Federation at the 
collective farm named for Kuybyshev in Gorodetskiy Rayon, 
Nizhniy Novgorod oblast. Before the conference the prime 
minister, who had arrived in Nizhniy Novgorod for a one-day 
visit, had taken part in a land auction at the collective farm 
named for the 60th anniversary October. 
  With the aid of experts from an international financial 
corporation who in conjunction with Russian specialists have 
developed an auction model for handing over public property into 
private hands, the collective farm members divided it among 
themselves into eight partnerships. Nizhniy Novgorod Governor 
Boris Nemtsov called this auction the third attempt in Russian 
history, after Aleksandr II and Petr Stolypin, to turn the 
peasants into strong private farmers. There is already 
experience of the similar disbandment of two farms on Nizhniy 
Novgorod land -- the "Pravdinskoye" and "Niva" farms in which 
auctions were held earlier. 
  The participants who spoke at the conference stressed that 
without the comprehensive solution of problems of the 
countryside the reform could be suspended because under the 
present conditions of poor roads, lack of money, and obsolete 
equipment it is simply senseless to count on a swift and 
effective return from the agro-industrial complex.

  [Text] Tel Aviv, 11 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev on his arrival in Tel Aviv today told 
journalists at Ben Gurion international airport that the aim of 
his mission in Israel and later in Tunis was to promote the 
resumption of the peace talks beteen Israel and the 
Palestinians. He said that Russia supports the demand made by 
the Palestine Liberation Organization for the deployment of 
international forces on the occupied territories as a condition 
for the continuation of the talks after the mass murder of 
Palestinins by a Jewish settler at al-Khalil [Hebron] mosque on 
25 February. Explaining the reasons for this position, the head 
of the Russian foreign policy department said that "we must also 
provide additional security, and we support an international 
presence" in these regions. 
  Regarding the development of the peace process in the Near 
East A. Kozyrev stressed the need for further progress toward a 
solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict with a view to "making an 
attempt to stick the separate pieces together into a single 
whole and not allow negative points to prevail." 
  Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, who welcomed 
Kozyrev at the airport, stated: "We shall be pleased to listen 
to what Kozyrev has to say in support of our proposals. 
However, the ideas that we have already heard from Russia will 
not in our opinion help to advance the peace process." 
  In this connection, local political circles are noting in 
particular that Yitzhak Rabin, the head of Israel's Government, 
had on the previous day, on 10 March, rejected Russia's 
initiative on convening the Madrid peace conference on the Near 
East anew for the purpose of unblocking the Arab-Israeli talks 
and had also expressed his emphatic opposition to the deployment 
of international peacekeeping forces in the occupied territories. 
  The head of Russia's foreign department will today hold 
talks 
with his counterpart Shi'mon Peres and Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin, and will then leave for Tunis where he will have a 
meeting with Yasir 'Arafat, the chairman of the PLO Executive 
Committee.

  [Text] Moscow March 11 TASS -- Russia has confirmed its 
readiness to send its observers to the Tuzla airport along with 
the transportation and other equipment necessary for the 
airport's functioning, ITAR-TASS was told by representatives 
from the inspection group of the Russian Federation Ministry for 
Civil Defence and Emergency Situations. 
  The inspection group had just returned from Belgrade. They 
said the United Nations had not yet determined the necessary 
number of personnel, or working and living conditions for the 
Russian staff. 
  After examining the Tuzla airport's runway, the Russian 
group 
came to the conclusion that it was ready to handle planes. 
Flight navigation equipment must be set up soon, fences must be 
restored, and some areas still have to be de-mined. 
  Because of the complicated military situation in the Tuzla 
area, humanitarian aid should not be flown into the airport 
before an agreement on safety guarantees is reached with all the 
sides involved in the conflict, the Russians recommended. 
Humanitarian flights should begin no earlier than one week 
after the airport is reopened.

<F P=106> [Report by Cristian Nita from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] The Central Electoral Commission today confirmed 
[as heard] the results of the 27 February parliamentary 
elections as follows: 
  The Agrarian Democratic Party of Moldova [PDAM] obtained 
43.13 percent of the votes, which amounts to 57 seats in the new 
parliament; 
  The Bloc of the Socialist Party and the Edinstvo Unity 
Movement obtained 22.0 percent of the votes, which equals 28 
seats; 
  The Bloc of Peasants and Intellectuals obtained 9.21 percent 
of the votes, which equals 11 seats; 
  The Christian-Democratic Popular Front Alliance obtained 
7.53 
percent of the votes, which means nine seats in parliament. 
  The other parties and independent candidates did not obtain 
the necessary number of votes needed to be represented in 
parliament. 
  The Central Electoral Commission will prepare an official 
report containing all violations of the [electoral] law found 
during the ballot. The report will then be sent to the Supreme 
Court of Justice, which will confirm the legality of the ballot 
within the following 10 days. 
  Commenting on the results of the parliamentary elections and 
the [6 March] public opinion poll titled "Consulting With the 
People" [actually a referendum in which the majority rejected 
the idea of Moldova's unification with Romania], Dumitru Motpan, 
the leader of the PDAM -- the party that obtained the most seats 
in parliament -- stated to ITAR-TASS that the absolute majority 
of the people has reasserted its belief in the independence and 
territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova. The PDAM will 
not act to halt reform, but rather it will act to further 
reform, the PDAM leader said. According to Motpan, the first 
task is to implement privatization, which will begin by giving 
land to the peasants. However, generally speaking, the solution 
to the economic problems depends on whether the state manages to 
increase labor productivity in Moldova's economy. To that 
purpose, Moldova will deepen and extend its relations both with 
the countries belonging to the CIS and with the West, Motpan 
stated. 
  According to the MOLDOVA-PRES agency, the PDAM leader also 
announced that the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova will 
alter the national anthem, which, said Motpan, is identical with 
neighboring Romania.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Todres report from Kaliningrad under the "Army" </F>
rubric: "Servicemen Think They May Not Be Withdrawn From 
Baltics. Vladimir Shumeyko Succeeds in Weapons Training at 
Baltic Fleet Base"] 
  [Text] Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko hit 
three half-length practice targets with short assault-rifle 
bursts fired "from the shoulder," thus having attained an 
officer's performance standard. Deputy Defense Minister 
Konstantin Kobets has registered the result. 
  Leaving the firing range in the city of Baltiysk -- the main 
base of the Baltic Fleet -- the speaker said that he would 
oppose the Finance Ministry's attempts to slash the Armed 
Forces' financing, because "servicemen have no benefits; on the 
contrary, they receive less than their due." 
  Local servicemen claim that a recent statement by Polish 
President Lech Walesa about an overconcentration of troops in 
Kaliningrad Oblast does not square with reality. Governor Yuriy 
Matochkin has told SEGODNYA that "around 10 percent of the 
oblast population have a direct relation to the Armed Forces," 
that is, around 90,000 people. According to the Baltic fleet 
staff, there are slightly more than 25,000 men serving in the 
fleet, although an average crew's strength is only 65 percent of 
the standard level. The command insists that the personnel has 
shrunk drastically in the past few years, as has the number of 
ships. 
  Vladimir Yegorov, the fleet's commander-in-chief, says that 
the fleet includes only a few submarines, which are currently 
being withdrawn from Latvia's Liepaja. Only two of them are 
operational, and none of them is nuclear, the commander said. 
"There have never been any nuclear arms in Baltiysk," a press 
center staffer said. 
  Officials at the Baltic Fleet staff say the last force to 
become part of the fleet was a missile boat squadron pulled out 
from Poland last year. Lieutenant General Anatoliy Pimenov, 
commander of the 11th Guards Army, which is deployed in the 
oblast, says that the last time his army was expanded was three 
years ago, when a motor rifle division withdrawn from 
Czechoslovakia was attached to it. Afterward, no troops have 
been redeployed to Russia's Baltic enclave, the servicemen say, 
while reports on the concentration of the military force have 
been prompted by foreign observers' mistaking units that pass 
the oblast on their way from East Europe for new troops. 
  It is not yet clear, however, how the upcoming merger of the 
region's two military bases -- in Baltiysk and St. Petersburg -- 
under a single command may affect the enclave's military might. 
Observers do not rule out that troops may be reallocated between 
the bases, and then new submarines may emerge in Baltiysk. 
  Oblast Administration chief Yuriy Matochkin, like a number 
of 
the Baltic Fleet's top officers, believes that "further 
reductions in the fleet are inevitable. And considerable ones 
at that -- up to 40 percent." Commander-in-Chief Vladimir 
Yegorov states firmly, however: "In our view, it cannot be any 
smaller. And the General Staff agrees."

  [Text] Kaliningrad, Russia, Mar 11, BNS -- Chairman of 
Russia's Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko met yesterday in 
Kaliningrad with Admiral Vladimir Yegorov, chief of Russia's 
Baltic Fleet. Yegorov assured that the Baltic Fleet is fully 
able to protect Russia's interests in the Baltic Sea. 
  The admiral noted that the fleet comprises 100 warships, 
including submarine destroyers and landing ships, rocket 
launches, and some submarines, as well as two flight regiments 
equipped with SU-24 attack aircraft, two squadrons of 
antisubmarine helicopters and coast guard forces. 
  Yegorov said that, in the course of fleet reform over the 
last two years, submarines carrying strategic nuclear weapons 
and long-distance aircraft were eliminated. 
  The number of warships in the Baltic has decreased more than 
twice since 1984, principally due to scrapping of old vessels. 
The number of men has also been reduced twice. 
  Shumeyko, Yegorov and Deputy Defense Minister General 
Konstantin Kobets visited a naval base in Baltiisk and observed 
tactical maneuvers at sea.

<F P=106> [Video report by T. Aldoshina, including recorded comment by </F>
Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko -- from the 
"Vesti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Aldoshina] Kaliningrad Oblast will never become a 
demilitarized zone. This statement was made today by Vladimir 
Shumeyko, just back from the region. 
  [Shumeyko] The world is so far organized in such a way that 
a 
sovereign state must have an Army. We have one, and it is our 
business, Russia's business, where this Army is stationed. If 
we believe it should be in Kaliningrad Oblast, that is how it 
will be. 
  [Aldoshina] Shumeyko disagrees strongly with those who say 
Russian troops are hampering the development of the region's 
economy. On the contrary: Just three months after the edict on 
Kaliningrad Oblast was passed, the oblast already has several 
distinctive features of a free economic zone. Shumeyko believes 
the time has come to create conditions for competition for the 
right to work in the oblast, so that entrepreneurs putting their 
stakes on the opportunities of the free economic zone invest 
their funds in the construction of port facilities, the 
development of fishing, and in solving other local problems. At 
the same time, the status of a free economic zone requires that 
traditional relations between the center and the oblast should 
be changed. As early as this spring, a treaty on delimitation 
of powers is to be signed with Kaliningrad, similar to the one 
concluded with Tatarstan earlier. 
  [Shumeyko] We will have to take a very close look at the 
text 
of the treaty: How many rights the federal government devolves 
to the region, and how many it retains; who is accountable to 
whom and in what way, for the operation of the oblast in the 
context of Russia as a whole. 
  [Aldoshina] Kaliningrad Oblast becomes a kind of a testing 
range for new economic relations. That is why an entire 
government delegation at the deputy ministers level was working 
in Kaliningrad alongside Vladimir Shumeyko.

  [Text] It is planned to hold command staff exercises in 
Kaliningrad Oblast, ITAR-TASS reports. During the exercises, 
methods of cooperation between ground forces and the Baltic 
Fleet will be worked out. A large group of generals and 
officers of the Russian Defense Ministry have been sent to the 
region to prepare for the exercises. 
  In the opinion of Konstantin Kobets, Russia's chief military 
inspector, it is necessary to check the combat capabilities of 
the troop structures that previously had powerful rear cover but 
which are now surrounded by states whose policy toward Russia is 
not always clear. In his opinion, the group of forces in the 
region should reliably ensure the defense of Russia's western 
borders.

<F P=106> [Nail Gafutulin report: "Certificates That Have Put </F>
Deserters in Prison"] 
  [Text] Samara -- A lot of ways have been thought up of 
avoiding the service draft All of these ways are illegal and 
punishable. That is clear to everyone. But, it turns out, 
there are whole organizations which aspire to the role.... 
  However, judge for yourselves what role they actually play 
in 
the final analysis. 
  Practically every day, young men of draft age and deserters 
from Russian subunits appeal to the Committee for the Protection 
of Servicemen at the All-Tatar Public Center [ATPC], submitting 
statements renouncing Russian citizenship and expressing the 
wish to serve in the National Guard of Tatarstan. Here they 
become the owners of certificates which, according to the ATPC 
leadership, replace passports; the passports remain at the 
military commissariats. On their military card draftees get an 
"Azatlyk" youth organization stamp certifying that they have 
been drafted into the Guard. 
  "The ATPC is deceiving people," according to Colonel of 
Justice Aleksandr Fadeyev, military prosecutor at the Kazan 
Garrison. 
  The deserters are promised the moon. They are told that they 
are being taken under the organization's protection, but in the 
end.... In actual fact, there is no legal foundation for this. 
A draftee is reassured, although in fact he is "on the run." 
And severe punishment still awaits him as a result. 
  Today fewer and fewer people trust the ATPC. No doubt the 
fact that criminal proceedings have twice been instituted 
against the organization's chairman-coordinator Z. Agliullin has 
had an effect. The first time it was for whipping up 
interethnic strife, the second for keeping firearms. But the 
main reason seems to lie elsewhere. Time has started to put the 
numerous organizations, unions, and parties which emerged 
following the collapse of the Union in their place. People who 
at first blindly believed the promises are now demanding action. 
But there is no action at the ATPC committee for the protection 
of servicemen and draftees.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Falichev: "Continuation of the Military </F>
Reforms Is a Priority State Task"] 
  [Text] As is known, any reform, no matter where it is 
carried out, is a pretty complex process, and painful as well. 
Our ailing economy is graphic confirmation of this. But how 
are the reforms progressing in the armed forces? What problems 
are cropping up? Finally, what is the country's top leadership's 
assessment of them? 
  The president recently delivered a message to parliament "On 
Strengthening the Russian State." A whole section of it is 
devoted to an analysis and assessment of the reforms in the 
Army, to what the Armed Forces are to be like in the immediate 
future. What is the situation? 
  The reforms in the Army and Navy are going according to 
plan: 
in line with the blueprint for the organizational development of 
the Armed Forces devised by the Defense Ministry, the Law "On 
Defense," and the defense minister's order. Since 7 May 1992 -- 
following the president's edict on the creation of the Russian 
Army -- 11 basic laws regulating the activities of the Armed 
Forces in the Russian Federation security system and more than 
100 normative legal acts have been devised and adopted. 
Parliament has ratified 14 international treaties and 
agreements in the military policy sphere. 
  As is known, the organizational development of the Armed 
Forces has been mapped out in three stages. The first ended in 
1992. Its tasks have been resolved. The decline in the level 
of combat readiness has been halted. Approaches to the creation 
of groupings of forces and general-purpose forces have been 
revised. The formation of new groupings has been started in 
connection with the changes in state borders -- which applies 
primarily to the Moscow and North Caucasus Military Districts. 
  Not everything has gone as smoothly as one would have liked, 
perhaps. At one stage it was necessary to adjust certain 
provisions of the blueprint for the organizational evolution of 
the Army, in particular those connected with the prospects for 
its development. The General Staff conducted a careful analysis 
and adjustment of the Armed Forces personnel in 1994-1995. Not 
surprisingly, since the reform began the authorized strength has 
been cut by nearly half a million men (457,000). Three military 
district directorates, eight Army directorates, one Army corps 
directorate, 19 divisional directorates, and eight military 
schools have been disbanded. The process of reducing the number 
of formations and combined units and higher educational 
establishments, scientific research institutions, and redundant 
and parallel management organs continues. The tasks the Army 
was set for this period were implemented by and large, Colonel 
General V. Zhurbenko, first deputy chief of the Russian 
Federation Armed Forces General Staff, believes. The reforms in 
the Armed Forces have gone according to plan. 
  What now? What can one expect in military policy in the 
immediate future? Before answering these questions let us 
stress that the president categorized the further reform of the 
Armed Forces as a priority state task. 
  "The content of the message gives some confidence that the 
correct reform path has been chosen," Lieutenant General G. 
Ivanov, chief of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry 
Military Organizational Development and Reforms Directorate, 
believes. "The message lays down the main guidelines for the 
organizational development of the Armed Forces and provides an 
assessment of the actual state of the forces: They are 
battleworthy. We saw this assessment as a confirmation of the 
correctness of the chosen course of army development and 
improvement." 
  The basic structure of the Armed Forces is clearly going to 
be preserved until 1996. But if we are talking about future 
reforms, then the entire complexion of the Armed Forces is 
probably going to be fundamentally transformed. Which will also 
affect the operational and strategic levels. Depending on the 
country's economic potential, of course. 
  What new contours are discernible right now in the 
structural 
makeup of the Armed Forces? Let us examine just some of the 
components. 
  Strategic Armed Forces. An analysis of the status of the 
Russian Armed Forces showed that in present-day conditions the 
Strategic Nuclear Forces have been and remain the real guarantor 
of Russia's security in the military sphere. This was confirmed 
in the president's message. It is enshrined in the military 
doctrine and in the blueprint for the organizational development 
of the Army and Navy. 
  General-Purpose Forces. The nature of Russia's geopolitical 
position and the reduction of the numerical strength of the 
Armed Forces demonstrate that it is impossible to have a 
grouping of forces along the entire length of the border, as was 
the case before. So their organizational development is based 
on the principle of mobile defense. Its implementation 
presupposes the availability of small but sufficiently powerful 
forces, ready for operational employment wherever a real threat 
to Russia's security occurs. Mobile forces are being created 
that are operationally maneuverable and capable of tackling 
tasks in various regions. 
  Military-Technical Policy. The priorities here include 
maintaining nuclear security; equipping mobile forces; providing 
the Army and Navy with modern means of battle command and 
control, communications, intelligence, and electronic warfare; 
and improving their reliability and survivability. 
  The Military Law Base. The entire legal foundation of the 
organizational development and activity of the Armed Forces has 
to be brought in line with the Constitution and basic provisions 
of the Russian Federation's military doctrine. Proposals have 
been prepared on adjusting existing laws in the defense sphere, 
and around 20 new draft laws will need adopting. In particular, 
"On Martial Law," "On the Military Police," and "On Naval 
Vessels." The plan is to give military lawyers the job of 
providing legal protection for Armed Forces servicemen and 
civilian personnel. To that end the possibility of creating a 
body of military lawyers, which we have never had before, is 
being considered. In other words law, above all, must replace 
ideology in the Armed Forces. The plan is to complete the 
elaboration of a blueprint for military law reform by mid-1994. 
  As for the military budget, it has not yet been approved for 
1994, unfortunately. Although the Defense Ministry has made all 
the necessary calculations and they have been submitted to the 
Russian Federation Finance Ministry and Economy Ministry. The 
fact is that until very recently the country did not even have a 
general budget. So financing will be on a month-to-month basis. 
  "Certainly we are not getting everything we need by any 
means," Major General V. Burov, chief of the Russian Federation 
Defense Ministry Main Military Budget and Financing Directorate 
Economic Directorate, said. "In January we only managed to 
provide pay and allowances and wages and tackle urgent tasks. 
The situation was the same in February. It is clearly not 
going to be any better in March...." 
  Nonetheless, the president's message does give some cause 
for 
optimism. When he delivered it he made it plain that military 
expenditure is not expenditure on war. This money is used to 
finance a substantial section of our science, to construct 
housing for "homeless officers," and to maintain our children 
serving in the Armed Forces. 
  Today the Armed Forces embark on the second stage of their 
reform, which will be completed in 1995. I believe that its 
tasks will be resolved, despite the complex economic situation 
in the country. The guarantor of this is the state itself, in 
which the Army remains a very important factor not only of 
external security but also of the stability of our society.

  [Text] Moscow March 14 TASS -- "I do not expect any 
aggravation of political tension in the country and am leaving 
for a vacation calmly," President Boris Yeltsin said at 
Vnukovo-2 before flying to Sochi today. 
  According to President Yeltsin, "a vacation is a change in 
the schedule of work" for him. He said that he was feeling 
normal after the flu and his trip was not "for treatment but for 
work." 
  During his vacation, the president intends to work on the 
definition of a mechanism of implementing the president's 
message to the Federal Assembly. Within the frame of this 
project, he will probably be visited in Sochi by Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin and other Russian leaders. 
  Responding a question from ITAR-TASS, Boris Yeltsin said 
that 
he would also work "during my vacation on drafting an agreement 
on civil peace and concord." 
  "Of course, it will not be simple to sign a memorandum of 
accord, the spectrum of differences is extensive," he said. 
"Nonetheless I believe that common approaches can be found and 
an agreement can be signed on their basis." 
  [Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian at 0900 GMT on 14 
March adds: "Yeltsin reported that he had recently undergone two 
bouts of influenza and was experiencing some weakness. However, 
he stressed that he was going to Sochi not for a cure but just 
for a vacation, and also to work."]

  [Text] Moscow March 14 TASS -- "It won't be easy to sign a 
memorandum of civil peace and accord, considering disagreements 
between political parties and movements in society," Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin said before his departure to a Black Sea 
resort on Monday. 
  The idea of signing the memorandum between various branches 
of power, political parties and public movements was proposed by 
Yeltsin during his meeting with journalists on March 9. On 
March 10 he held the first working meeting to draw up a draft 
document. 
  Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, 
confirmed his readiness to cooperate with other parties. "The 
development of the political situation in the country will 
depend on the solution of economic rather than political tasks. 
Unless we stabilise the economy, the country will be doomed to 
political catastrophes," he said. 
  Lev Ponomarev, leader of the Democratic Russia Movement, 
told 
ITAR-TASS that he "did not believe in the possibility of forging 
a union with communists and other representatives of the 
opposition." He called for "unconditional support for the idea 
of civil peace and accord by his movement." "I am sure that 
during the work on the memorandum the opposition will demand 
state regulation of prices and other conditions of restoration 
of socialism. In that case we will not be able to sign the 
document," Ponomarev said. 
  Grigoriy Serebrenikov, a member of the faction of the 
Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) in the State Duma, said that 
"the LDPR has already made a step towards civil peace" and 
"plans to take an active part in the development of the draft 
memorandum."

  [Text] Moscow, 14 Mar -- The press service of the Russian 
president has circulated the text of a decree by Boris Yeltsin 
"On certain matters relating to the resignation of the 
procurator general of the Russian Federation." It states: 
  "Owing to the fact that A.I. Kazannik was appointed to the 
post of procurator general of the Russian Federation not in 
accordance with the procedure laid down by Article 102 of the 
Russian Federation Constitution, and taking into consideration 
his personal request, I resolve: 
  1. To regard the resignation of Aleksey Ivanovich Kazannik 
from the post of procurator general of the Russian Federation as 
accepted. 
  2. To deem Point 1 of the decree by the Russian Federation 
president of 26 February 1994, No.391 "On the procurator general 
of the Russian Federation" as no longer valid. 
  3. This decree takes effect on publication.

<F P=106> ["Own information" report: "Aleksey Kazannik's Surprise </F>
Move"] 
  [Text] Aleksey Kazannik, who is now in Omsk, has confirmed 
in a telephone conversation with the IZVESTIYA editorial office 
that he intends to ask the Federation Council, which is 
responsible under the Constitution for appointing the general 
prosecutor to his post and releasing him from it, not to accept 
his resignation which he tendered to the president 26 February 
in connection with well known events. Kazannik believes that he 
has not broken the law or thereby provided grounds for being 
released from his post. He voiced confidence that Russia could 
have in him a really independent general prosecutor. To date, 
Kazannik has not received from the Federation Council an 
invitation to participate in the session at which his question 
will be discussed, and he does not intend to "angle" for this, 
although he reckons that the question of his resignation will 
not, all the same, be examined in the absence of the claimant. 
  This statement appears strange, to say the least, if you 
recall that Aleksey Kazannik tendered his resignation to Boris 
Yeltsin of his own will and even against the will of Yeltsin, 
and it was widely rumored by the General Prosecutor's Office.

  [Text] [Announcer] There was an attempt on the life of 
Konstantin Borovoy, the leader of the Economic Freedom Party, in 
Yaroslavl Oblast this morning. His automobile was shot at and 
then blown up. Fortunately, Borovoy managed to get out of the 
automobile before the explosion. Sergey Dadyko with the details. 
  [Dadyko] Two hours ago and straight after his arrival from 
Yaroslavl, Konstantin Borovoy gave the details of the attempt to 
kill him. Shots were fired into the right-hand side of the 
windshield of his Mercedes, after which Borovoy, who was at the 
wheel, veered left into a ditch. A second later he jumped out 
into the snow, and after that came the explosion. 
  Police have begun an investigation, and in the burned-out 
automobile found eight bullets from an automatic weapon and 
grenade fragments. But the question of who fired on him remains 
unanswered. 
  [Borovoy] You understand, there are not many people like me, 
if you take an unbiased look at me. I have often spoken out in 
various ways. You know what I said about the exchanges. I was 
very outspoken about Lipetsk. But I do not think this was a 
political event. I reckon it was just small-time thugs.

Not Changed"] 
  [Text] Riga, 5 Mar -- Today, Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Georgs Andrejevs met with Ints Silins, the Ambassador of the 
United States to Latvia, to express his incomprehension 
regarding U.S. State Secretary Christopher Warren's statement at 
the session of the Senate's sub-committee on 2 March, the 
Foreign Affairs Ministry press service announced. As DIENA 
already reported, W. Christopher had pointed out in his 
statement that, in his opinion, Russia can undertake activities 
aimed "at stimulating Latvians" in the direction of broadening 
the circle of citizens and granting voting rights to the 
Russians residing in Latvia. During today's conversation, G. 
Andrejevs expressed his incomprehension and anxiety over such 
utterances from a high-level American official. In his reply, 
I. Silins explained that they refer entirely to the inhabitants 
of Latvia who are Russians by nationality. He also said that Mr. 
Christopher meant for lawful and democratic methods to be used 
by Latvia's Russians in persuading Latvians to take their 
interests into account. 
  Summarizing, I. Silins emphasized that the principal policy 
of the United States toward Latvia has not changed.

Latvia and Hungary concluded a bilateral cooperation accord 
during the visit of Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs to 
Hungary this week. 
  The agreement provides for mutual consultations aimed at

Andrejevs told reporters Saturday [12 March] at a press briefing 
in the Riga airport. 
  Andrejevs also handed over to the Hungarian leadership draft 
agreements on investment protection and avoidance of double

cooperation, Andrejevs noted. 
  The minister, however, questioned the efficiency of 
implementation of agreements on trade and air communication. 
  During his Hungarian trip, Andrejevs met with President 
Arpad

  [Text] The coordinating council of the Democratic Union 
(led by Valeriya Novodvorskaya) has laid the responsibility for 
the attempt to kill the leader of the Economic Freedom Party, 
Konstantin Borovoy, on President Boris Yeltsin, and accused him 
of "conniving at fascists and communists." 
  "The shots sounded when it had become known that the 
Economic 
Freedom Party will not join Zyuganov's Communists and 
Zhirinovskiy's respectable fascists in signing a document on 
civil concord," the union said in its communique released on 
Sunday. 
  According to the communique, the attempt to kill Borovoy "is 
the start of red political terror and the first consequence of 
the amnesty granted to political criminals and of the discourse 
on civil peace and accord with communists and fascists." 
  The Democratic Union believes that the stand taken by 
President Yeltsin will lead in Russia to "democracy without 
democrats," who will be removed either "with the help of Soviet 
courts -- witness the case of Vil Mirzayanov, or with the help 
of political terror, as in the case of Konstantin Borovoy." 
  In this connection the Democratic Union "gives the Russian 
president a month to cancel the amnesty, return the October 
rebels to prison, and outlaw the extremist activity of 
communists and fascists." Otherwise we shall consider ourselves 
free to start forming on April 12th armed units to defend 
ourselves, democracy, civilization and the Constitution together 
with other radical democratic forces," said the Democratic Union 
of Russia in its communique.

  [Text] The Moscow Government has decided to allow a number 
of opposition parties and movements to hold rallies on 17 March. 
The rallies, according to the intentions of the organizers, are 
timed to coincide with the third anniversary of the referendum 
on the fate of the USSR. 
  The applicants to hold rallies, which are to be held in the 
very center of Moscow on Theater Square -- the aim of which, 
according to the organizers, is to confirm the people's volition 
for the unity of the country, as expressed in the March 1991 
referendum and also the leading role of Russia in creating a 
single union state -- are the Russian Communist Party, the 
National Salvation Front, Working Moscow, the Liberal Democratic 
Party, and Revival. 
  Sergey Dontsov, head of the Moscow Council's State Legal 
Directorate, today spoke to their representatives, calling on 
them to strictly follow the aim of the planned action and not to 
try the patience of the Moscow authorities by coming out with 
slogans which do not fit in with the direct purpose of the 
rallies. In this regard, Sergey Dontsov warned those present 
that if such incidents, which have already taken place on 
several occasions, are repeated, then opposition parties and 
movements will no longer be allowed to meet on Theater Square, 
but given places further from the center.

Minister and Economics Minister Yegor Gaydar does not rule out 
the possibility of his "third advent" to the Russian Government, 
Gaydar told journalists in the Perm airport late on Sunday. He 
arrived in Perm at the invitation of Perm Region Governor Boris 
Kuznetsov. 
  "I firmly believe Russia's main problem now is linked with 
the slowing down of the social life transformation process", 
Gaydar said. "I am convinced the ongoing transformations can be 
given a new impetus. I am ready to work on this in the 
government when there are political preconditions for it", 
Gaydar said. 
  Gaydar plans to meet on Monday with the regional 
administration and entrepreneur's to discuss the situation in 
Russia, prospects for its development as well as the most acute 
problems the region and the whole country are facing. Gaydar 
also plans to visit the school his grandmother went to and to 
acquaint himself with the Perm period of his grandfather's -- 
renowned Russian writer Arkadiy Gaydar -- life.

not given: "Every Intelligent Person Knew About the Amnesty"] 
  [Text] [Popov] How do you explain the surprise of certain 
politicians and statesmen after the adoption of the decree on 
the political amnesty? 
  [Shakhray] Every intelligent person in Russia knew already 
on 12 December -- the first day after the elections -- that 
there would be a decree on amnesty in Russia. The text was 
discussed several times. Representatives of the presidential 
administration attended the meeting at which the last variant 
was discussed. Therefore, President Boris Yeltsin knew 
precisely about the text and the attitude of the parliamentary 
forces. The 18 affirmative votes of the PRES could not change 
anything. The reaction and confusion show that, as before, at 
the federal level, there is no coordination between the 
president, the government, and the prosecution. 
  [Popov] Do you think that the amnesty would also have been 
adopted had it been outside the package of documents? 
  [Shakhray] Without any doubt. This amnesty was not a goal 
in itself, but a step toward civic peace. However, I would like 
to draw your attention precisely to the package of documents. I 
do not understand why people only speak about the amnesty 
decree. First of all, there is the memorandum. On the basis of 
this memorandum, political forces must sit together, negotiate, 
and reach certain agreements about accord, which will guarantee 
that those who have been released will not provoke civic 
clashes. Then, there are certain judicial guarantees that sound 
as a warning, namely, that each of the released could be 
imprisoned again. Only afterward were they allowed to leave 
their cells. However, even in itself, the political amnesty is 
an element of civic peace. We bear responsibility for our 
decisions and for not allowing any bloodshed. 
  [Popov] Your party congress has just ended. How do you view 
your place in political life and your party's influence? 
  [Shakhray] We are one of the five leading parties and 
perhaps even more than that. We are trying to construct an 
all-national party. We have 64 active regional organizations 
and several dozen are in the process of registration. This is a 
conservative party based on traditional values -- the state, 
family, property, and morality. 
  Our formula for Russia's renewal contains a socially 
oriented 
market economy, federalism, and local self-government. Our main 
task is not only to represent the regions in the federation 
center but also to influence the formation and implementation of 
all-state interests. 
  [Popov] Do you expect a reshaping of the Russian political 
space and what direction will this take? 
  [Shakhray] We think that two or three all-national parties 
are needed, and one of them is our party, which represents a 
conservative regional idea. Sooner or later, an all-national 
social democratic party will emerge. It could have various 
names, but its prospects are promising. It is more difficult to 
speak about the third party because Zhirinovskiy already uses a 
popular name for his party [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]. 
However, conservative, social-democratic, and liberal ideas 
will crystallize in the form of three major parties. The 
emergence of those three economic and political currents depends 
to a large degree on election legislation. If the percentage 
barrier is raised, such blocs will emerge sooner. In any event, 
elections remain the only way for these parties to emerge.

  [Text] The Electoral Commission of the one-mandate District 
N 114 in the town of Shchelkovskiy, from which Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy was elected to the Duma, has appealed to Moscow's 
Regional Court. 
  The Commission's Chairman Nikolay Demenev has reported to 
Interfax that the appeal was filed in response to the 
Shchelkovskiy Town Court decision to dismiss the election 
results as invalid because of the violations exposed in the 
commission's work. 
  In an interview with Interfax Demenev denied that 
Zhirinovskiy's victory had been rigged as a result of improper 
votes counting. In his opinion, not a single electoral 
commission member shares Zhirinovskiy's views or sides with him. 
"We were politically impartial and absolutely objective. As 
for insignificant irregularities, they can be found in any 
electoral commission", Demenev declared. In his opinion, this 
legal case is "explicitly" political, and its aim is to strip 
Zhirinovskiy of his parliamentary mandate. 
  "To stop at nothing to discredit electoral commission 
workers 
is base", Demenev said. 
  Legal proceedings against the electoral commission were 
initiated by Oleg Novikov, a candidate to the Duma from that 
district. The commission's appeal will be considered next 
week-end.

  [Text] Moscow, 14 Mar -- Russia and Belarus "are capable of 
concluding an agreement on unifying currency systems." Russia's 
head of government announced this today in a short talk with 
journalists. According to Viktor Chernomyrdin, he knows nothing 
"about demands Russia is allegedly making of Belarus." He is 
convinced that "solutions acceptable both to Russia and to 
Belarus will be found." 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin pointed out that the negotiations 
between 
Russia and Belarus "are proceeding normally." "No one has made 
any demands of anyone else," the prime minister emphasized. 
  Advocating that an agreement on unifying currency systems be 
signed as soon as possible, the Russian head of government 
stated that he "opposes hasty decisions." In his opinion, 
"haste will not help." The prime minister is firmly convinced 
that the main thing is not only that an agreement should be 
signed, but that it should be implemented.

<F P=106> [Yelena Kolokoltseva, Dmitriy Volkov report under the </F>
"Hopes" rubric: "Budget Passed to State Duma. Incentives for 
Domestic Producers May Cause Importers' Apathy"] 
  [Text] The unapproved Russian draft budget for 1994 has 
been passed to the State Duma. Its main figures confirm that 
the government plans to offset the reduction in direct tax rates 
and the VAT [value-added tax] primarily by raising import 
tariffs. The tight protectionism in favor of domestic 
producers, who have still now not given up hope of converting 
their products into full-fledged commodities, may cause a 
situation, however, where actual budget revenues will be 
significantly lower than what is planned. A high import tariff 
is effective only if there is something it can be imposed on. 
  The attached table shows the overly high level of estimated 
budget revenues in 1994. According to estimates made by the 
Finance Ministry, which had drawn up the draft budget, the 
relative increase in the share of indirect taxes to be received 
by the federal treasury as a percentage of GDP is attributable 
to the imposition of a new type of tax (a charge for the support 
of the agro-industrial sector and the coal industry), the 
increase in the excise rates on imported alcoholic drinks (by 30 
percent) starting 1 January 1994, and a change in the 
distribution of VAT revenues between various levels of the 
budget system. In the Finance Ministry's view, the change in 
the share of direct taxes as a percentage of GDP has been caused 
by amendments made to the taxation and budget legislation 
(calling for new tax rates to be levied on individuals and legal 
entities). 
  The Finance Ministry explains the increase in revenues from 
foreign economic activity in the GDP by the fact that starting 
from 1994 foreign currency funds are taken into account together 
with ruble revenues, but in order to estimate the total amount 
of revenues they are converted into rubles at an exchange rate 
forecast for the end of 1994 (to all appearances, Finance 
Ministry specialists hope that it will be kept at 3,200 rubles 
per dollar). In addition, the Finance Ministry hopes to collect 
the bulk of its estimated revenues from foreign economic 
operations by raising import tariffs.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets </F>
by correspondent Chernyshova; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Chernyshova] Oleg Nikolayevich, the press has been 
discussing the recent expanded government session for already 
more than a week. One can say that the government is not in a 
hurry to be involved in this discussion. If we summarize all 
statements, I think that probably the main claims to the adopted 
budget will be the absence of the mechanism of its realization. 
Representatives of the right- and left-wings as well as heads 
of administrations have been talking about this. Do we really 
have this mechanism of fulfillment of the budget and the plan 
for 1994? 
  [Soskovets] During the week after the government session, a 
group of Presidium members and representatives of regions that 
were formed to finalize this resolution worked on changes in the 
nature of this document in order to elaborate those mechanisms 
that would allow us to realize everything that was said -- the 
president's message and a speech by the government chairman. 
These proposals that were formulated in this document, as a way 
to realize those critical remarks, are very specific. 
Undoubtedly, we believe that the mechanism of fulfillment of 
this document and this program of reforms that are now at a new 
stage, is closely connected with the strengthening of the role 
of the state and discipline, which is necessary for the 
fulfillment of some certain requests by the state and economic 
subjects. I believe that at this stage our citizens should 
consider this as the next stage and the next specific step by 
the government in order to form a new life in Russia. 
  [Chernyshova] Oleg Nikolayevich, as far as I understood now, 
the government has determined its priorities in the development 
of the economy. Is this true? I mean these sectors that the 
state will support financially. Observers say that they are 
afraid that this may lead to a new round of inflation. 
  [Soskovets] As far as the military-industrial complex is 
concerned, of course, we will not manage without those capital 
investments and budget allocations that are now necessary to 
carry out these reforms in our military industry which, I 
believe, is very important. Of course, some additional money 
will be needed, but we will not be able to create all the 
conditions that are necessary for our Armed Forces without 
supporting the production of the military-industrial complex. 
As far as agriculture is concerned, we really need a deep 
reform there. On the one hand, it takes time and on the other, 
these losses that we had last year were connected with the fact 
that there was not enough fuel and lubricants, as well as 
necessary equipment during the harvesting period. 
  [Chernyshova] As I understand, you later widened the 
allocation of money both to the defense industry and 
agriculture, right? 
  [Soskovets] According to the principles of budget formation 
for 1994 regarding these two articles of the budget, we 
proceeded from the level of expenditure in 1993. I think that 
these decisions will be justified at this stage. In order to 
continue with conversion and re-specializing, we need to spend 
money. 
  [Chernyshova] The state, represented by the government, 
keeps 
emphasizing all the time that the social sphere will be a 
priority in 1994. When one starts looking at the budget, 
article-by-article, one realizes that not much money has been 
allocated to the social sphere in any of them. 
  [Soskovets] We have not yet abandoned the old principles of 
management in this sphere. We will use every possibility to 
insure the implementation of this policy of developing the 
social sphere. The situation was aggravated by the fact that 
many social infrastructures that were supported by industrial 
enterprises now become municipal property, which requires 
additional expenditure from local budgets. Arrangements will 
have to be made to support them from the federal budget. All 
these issues are undoubtedly a weak point of this message. We 
are working on tidying it all up. 
  [Chernyshova] You know, it is inconceivable that the 
government, having made normal and reasonable decisions, allows 
the situation when none of them is carried out. There is no 
executive or financial discipline anywhere. 
  [Soskovets] I think that this is the result of the loss at a 
certain stage of the capability to manage and the state's 
participation in the formation of these relations. If you take 
countries with long-established market relations, there is no 
division there between the interests of the state and of some 
kind of economic entity. There is no such thing anywhere. 
Unfortunately, it happened in our country. I would like to 
dwell on three examples of the restoration of the necessary 
discipline in the state. I would, of course, put the discipline 
with regard to the payment of wages to employees at the top of 
the list. A resolution describes the degree of responsibility 
of managers who leave their employees without wages for several 
months and, of course, the mechanism of forming guarantees for 
compulsory payment of a certain level of wages in cases when 
enterprises' bank accounts are affected to a greater or lesser 
extent by nonpayments. 
  With regard to financial discipline, I would like to point 
out that one of the main issues of the day is how to organize 
tax collection. At present, the system has not yet been 
perfected by the Finance Ministry, the Tax Inspectorate, or the 
Tax Police. The Currency Control Committee has put forward 
specific proposals, envisaging visits to the regions, to 
individual areas we in the government have already determined, 
in order to disclose all the irregularities in this matter -- 
this might even lead to contracts being cancelled with those 
heads of enterprises who had, to some extent, taken advantage of 
the current lack of state supervision. So, order will be 
restored in these relations. 
  The State Committee for the Management of State Property was 
instructed to draw up a system under which contracts will simply 
be cancelled with hardened tax dodgers, and new managers will be 
recruited for those enterprises. 
  The resolution regulates relations between commercial banks 
and those enterprises for which they have to provide financial 
guidance and backing. Numerous examples of delays and mistakes 
in economic relations show the lack of commitment on the part of 
commercial banks to the productive activity of enterprises. The 
Russian Central Bank was asked to draw up a system under which 
banks like this would lose their license to conduct specified 
kinds of financial activity. 
  [Chernyshova] Now probably the final question, Oleg 
Nikolayevich. You have mentioned the industries the government 
intends to provide with additional funding. Why then do you say 
that by the end of the year inflation will be no higher than 10 
percent?. 
  [Soskovets] Well, you know, we... 
  [Chernyshova, interrupting] After all, you are making the 
hole in the budget even larger. 
  [Soskovets] Through our actions, through our actions, we 
still hope to change the situation with Gross Domestic Product. 
This should be the starting point. The fact is that the ratio 
of the budget deficit to the GDP, with such a low volume of 
production, when dozens of enterprises, that is potential 
tax-payers, are currently shut down, does not allow one to say 
that with a significant drop in the GDP, stabilization of the 
budget deficit can be achieved. Our task today is to step up 
production at those entities that contribute to the formation of 
the budget. I believe that if we tackle this task correctly, we 
will achieve success. For nowhere in the world of developed 
market economies does a state allow the enterprises that bring 
the state close to bankruptcy to operate. This then is our task. 
  [Chernyshova] Thank you.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS observer Aleksandr Dzyublo] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 14 TASS -- The decision not to import 
grain this year, announced by President Yeltsin, is based on the 
estimates of specialists. In the opinion of scientists from the 
All-Russian Research Institute of the Economic Management of 
Agriculture, Russia is quite ready for not only stopping grain 
imports by the state, but also for increasing the exports of its 
own grain. 
  Grain imports began in the 60's after the agricultural 
experiments of Nikita Khrushchev, which ended in failure. 
Between 1961 and 1965 Russia accounted for about two million 
tonnes of grain a year out of the grain imported for all the 
USSR republics. Consequently, the average annual per capita 
level was 16 kg. However, in 1992 Russia imported 28 million 
tonnes, or 188 kg per capita. In 1992, the best of the past 
several years, grain imports accounted for 32 per cent of the 
domestic grain output. 
  American farmers were the first to profit from massive 
Russian grain imports: They got a stable market for their grain, 
supported by the administration, for decades to come. In 
addition, grain deliveries from the U.S. were usually made on 
condition that Russia would pay for the freight of American 
ships, which transported the grain. U.S. credits for Russia's 
grain purchases, described as "aid", had to be returned with 
market interest rates. A considerable part of them were 
short-term credits. In short, Russia's grain imports were an 
expensive undertaking for it. 
  The question arose: Are grain imports really so necessary 
for 
Russia? Statistical data show that the amount of grain per 
capita of the population was continually increasing over the 
past decade. Last year's per capita level of 538 kg was far 
greater than 342 kg in the years, when Russia was exporting and 
not importing grain. Analysing the problem, scientists from the 
research institute of the economic management of agriculture 
came to the conclusion that there were two reasons for the 
growth of grain imports. The most important of them is that the 
growth of the production and consumption of livestock-breeding 
products, registered during the past several years, was achieved 
through the growth of the use of grain as fodder for the stock 
and the poultry. Grain imports helped to make up for the 
wasteful use of part of the domestic grain output for fodder 
purposes. A shortage of high-quality wheat was the second 
reason for massive grain imports. 
  In the opinion of Russian scientists, both factors can be 
eliminated in the near future with the help of corresponding 
corrections in the economic policy. A considerable, 
scientifically substantiated reduction of the consumption of 
fodder grain will become a real way of overcoming grain 
shortages. 
  However, the termination of grain imports by the state does 
not mean that commercial structures will also stop buying grain 
abroad.

<F P=106> [Report by Natalya Shulyar, chief editor of INFO-TEK news </F>
agency: "Will the Switch-Off Effect Work? Fuel and Energy 
Complex: Two Months' Results"] 
  [Text] Despite the extremely grave financial crisis, the 
explosive situation in mining regions, the prestrike situation 
of the Tyumen oil workers, and the unusually cold February -- 
despite all these factors, Russia's fuel and energy complex is 
continuing to operate in fairly stable conditions. The 
reduction in energy resource production volumes is comparable to 
the rate of decline in 1993. 
  This is demonstrated by current data on the work of the 
Russian Ministry of Fuel and Energy for the first two months of 
this year submitted by sector structures (see table). 
  The decline in oil extraction, not counting extraction by 
joint enterprises, corresponds approximately to last year's 
level -- 12-14 percent. Among major joint-stock oil companies, 
"Surgutneftgaz" has seen the smallest reduction (20 percent). 
  Regarding gas extraction, the picture is more rosy: Some of 
the decline (0.4 percent) is taking place at the expense of oil 
extraction associations, whereas the "Gazprom" Russian 
Joint-Stock Company has actually increased extraction slightly 
in comparison with last year (by 116 million cubic meters). Two 
associations that are not part of the "Gazprom" Russian 
Joint-Stock Company have increased extraction by even larger 
amounts -- the "Norilskgazprom" state enterprise (by 3 percent) 
and "Yakutgazprom" (by 12 percent). 
  During January and February 1994 exports of Russian oil 
outside the Commonwealth were a few percentage points lower than 
last year's level, amounting in absolute terms to 11.5 million 
tonnes (about 20 percent of extraction). Russian gas exports to 
countries outside the Commonwealth was maintained at last year's 
level of 17.8 billion cubic meters (or 17 percent of extraction). 
  Owing to the insolvency of consumers in the former USSR 
republics, volumes of oil and gas deliveries to these consumers 
have continued to decline. The former republics' debts for 
energy resources supplied as of 1 February 1994 were already 2.5 
trillion rubles [R], of which R1.5 trillion are owed by Ukraine 
(including R1.2 trillion for supplies of natural gas), and R390 
billion are owed by Belarus (of which R310 billion are for gas). 
  The overall snowballing of the amount owed by consumers of 
the fuel and energy complex, which has already passed the 
R16-trillion mark, is bringing the complex to a standstill. It 
has no choice but to take the traditional chance that the 
debtors will pay up, or...shut off the oil spigots and gas 
valves on the pipes, which is what the "Gazprom" Russian 
Joint-Stock Company has already partially done in relation to 
Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova. It seems that this "incentive" 
for drawing partners into true market relations is starting to 
work.

  [Text] The volumes of procurements of arms, military 
equipment, and defense scientific and design developments will 
be preserved in 1994 in the volumes determined by the 
government's decision dated last December 21. Interfax has 
learned that this decision was adopted at a conference chaired 
by Russia's First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets on Friday. The 
Finance Ministry was proposed to foresee an appropriate level of 
military order financing before sending the state budget to the 
State Duma. 
  Conference participants pointed out that a sharp reduction 
of 
defense orders would result in unrecoverable consequences for 
the country's defense potential and would necessitate social 
compensation payments in accordance with the legislature. As 
participants of the conference note, they will exceed possible 
economy from the reduction of the defense order planned earlier 
by Rbs [Rubles] 2-3 Tn [Trillion]. 
  The conference particularly considered the proposal of the 
First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin on the mechanism 
to end the crisis in defense enterprises, which also produce 
civilian products.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 14, BNS -- The presidents of Latvia and 
Russia could fix the amount of rent for the former Soviet 
military radar at Skrunda in Latvia at a bilateral meeting, 
Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs told reporters 
Saturday [12 March]. 
  The state delegations for withdrawal talks voiced the 
probability during mutual consultations, Andrejevs noted. The 
next round of talks is scheduled to open Monday in Moscow. 
  As reported, Russia offered Latvia 2 million USD per each 
year of the operation of the radar after the troop withdrawal is 
completed. The Latvian counterproposal was 400 million U.S. 
dollars per year. 
  Chief Russian negotiator Sergei Zotov has no authority to 
alter the Russian proposal but Latvia also cannot make that 
large concessions, said Andrejevs. 
  In addition, Andrejevs said that Russia has drafted a 
timetable for the withdrawal of troops from the Baltic country. 
  The command of Russia's Northwest Army group only needs a 
signed interstate agreement to start implementation of the 
timetable, Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh has told 
Andrejevs. 
  The issue of social guarantees for Russian military 
pensioners could be tackled jointly with the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe experts if the delegations 
fail to reach an agreement by themselves, the minister said. 
  As reported, Russia has promised to withdraw the remaining 
troops by Aug. 31 if Latvia allows it keep the radar station for 
five and a half years.

  [Text] No unanimous agreement on free trade in 
agro-industrial produce has been reached by the negotiating 
parties at a consultative meeting held in Riga yesterday by the 
Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian ministers of agriculture. 
Perhaps this will be achieved next time when the ministers meet 
again in Tallinn. 
  Talking about the results of the meeting, Latvian Minister 
of 
Agriculture Janis Kinna, Lithuanian Minister of Agriculture 
Rimantas Karazija, and Estonian Minister of Agriculture Jaan 
Leestar described the consultations as important because 
information was been exchanged and the positions of the parties 
were clarified. 
  During the discussion on (?establishing links) with the 
European Union and joining the economic organizations of this 
region, unanimous agreement was achieved by the agriculture 
ministers of the Baltic states, the Latvian News Agency reported.

<F P=106> [Article by Liga Laizane: "Government Needs Half a Year to </F>
Consider Purchase of Arms"] 
  [Text] Riga, 3 Mar -- To make a decision about when, what 
and how many arms to purchase, the government needs at least 
half a year, said the Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs today. 
"This month, we have found ourselves in a new situation, when 
many countries, such as Poland, the United States, Great 
Britain, Sweden, and the Czech Republic, expressed their 
readiness to sell us arms. Of course it is in the interests of 
the government to resolve this matter sooner," said the prime 
minister at a press conference, at which government 
representatives were reporting on their visit to Israel. 
  The main condition for the arms purchase from Israel would 
be a proposal of a long-term (at least 12 years) credit. V. 
Birkavs did not want to mention a specific sum and percentage 
for the credit, but, due to his estimations, the sum would not 
surpass half the Estonian credit. As DIENA already reported, it 
is $56 million, therefore the Latvian credit would amount to no 
more than $28 million. 
  According to V. Birkavs, Latvia is interested in antitank 
weapons, communication equipment for the police, and border 
control systems. The Minister of Home Affairs, Girts 
Pavlovskis, and the Commander of the Defense Forces, Dainis 
Turlais, have visited a few factories manufacturing arms. G. 
Kristovskis said that he was quite impressed. 
  On Monday [7 March], a meeting of the leaders of the three 
Baltic states and the Nordic states will take place in 
Stockholm. V. Birkavs will consult with Mart Laar and Adolf 
Slezevicius on the common Baltic borders protection system with 
modern technology, and also problems of border security will be 
discussed. "And yet, this is not only a problem of security, 
but also of advantage," said V. Birkavs. The cost of the 
technical equipment could be considerably lower, if it would be 
purchased in larger quantity. All Baltic states have the common 
goal of joining NATO, therefore it would be convenient to buy 
similar arms and border protection systems, he pointed out.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 11, BNS -- Latvian Prosecutor's Office 
cannot bring charges against newspapers that published names and 
addresses of Russian military persons because the actions cannot 
be regarded a criminal offense, Rita Aksenoka, an aide to the 
prosecutor general, told BNS. 
  Aksenoka's explanations followed to a note from the Russian 
Embassy in Riga to the Latvian Foreign Ministry. The note said 
the publications in the national radical ATMATA and PAVALSTNIEKS 
papers endanger the mentioned servicemen and complicate 
relations between Latvia and Russia. 
  The note describes as provocative headlines "They are 
Occupants" and "Under their Feet the Land Moans" and says 
Russian diplomats hope that Latvian authorities will take legal 
steps to prevent further incidents. 
  The Prosecutor's Office, however, can only bring charges for 
misinformation. So far, it has received no claims that the 
published information was not true, said Deputy Prosecutor 
General Edvins Ziedins. 
  If there is enough evidence to prove that the publications 
called for violence, the papers may face adequate charges with a 
prospect of being closed, said Aksenoka.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 11, BNS -- The Latvijas Gaze (Latvian 
Gas) statestock company is unable to pay its 23-million-U.S. 
dollar debt to Russia's Gazprom by April 1. 
  The repayment deadline is included in the March 5 contract 
between Latvijas Gaze and Gazprom on Russian gas supplies to 
Latvia in 1994. 
  The enterprise will not be able to pay the debt on time 
because a World Bank credit may be delayed. 
  As reported, the Latvian Government allowed Latvijas Gaze to 
use the Japanese Import-Export Bank's credit, part of a G-24 
credit to Latvia, to fulfill its obligations to Gazprom. 
  The debt of the CIS and the Baltic states to Gazprom in 1993 
constituted 4 billion U.S. dollars. 
  On the other hand, consumers owe Latvijas Gaze 44 million 
U.S. dollars. The largest debtors are Latvenergo (Ls 11,000) 
and Sloka papermill (Ls 3,200). 
  Latvijas Gaze sued more than 80 enterprises to the Economic 
Court. The court has ruled in all cases in favor of Latvijas 
Gaze but the debtors fail to fulfill the court rulings.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 12, BNS -- The Latvian Economics Ministry 
has prepared a draft resolution to speed up the payment of debts 
to the Latvijas Gaze (Latvian Gas) state-stock company. 
  The debt of gas consumers presently totals 40 million lats. 
  Under the draft resolution, industrial consumers may face a 
50-percent cut in gas supplies if they fail to release or reduce 
the debt in two weeks. 
  In case the repayment is delayed, the debtor is warned and 
if 
that does not work, the gas supply is suspended. 
  The ministry also plans to ask the Finance Ministry grant 
sales tax waivers to heating enterprises which provide heating 
for apartment houses. 
  The resolution is coordinated with the Finance Ministry and 
the Justice Ministry. The State Reforms Ministry has not 
revealed its viewpoint yet.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 12, BNS -- Natural gas will cost 77.5 U.S. 
dollars per 1,000 cubic meters this year, according to the gas 
supply contract between the Latvijas Gaze (Latvian Gas) and 
Russia's Gazprom gas consortiums. 
  In Lithuania and Estonia gas prices are lower than in Latvia 
because the two have agreed to form joint ventures with Gazprom, 
Latvijas Gaze Director Adrians Davis told reporters Friday [11 
March]. Latvijas Gaze has, so far, created no mergers with any 
other countries. 
  Latvijas Gaze and Gazprom leadership concluded a contract 
March 5 on gas supplies to Latvia in 1994 and discussed a 
long-term contract that could regulate gas supplies for 10 or 15 
years. 
  The long-term contract could be signed at the end of the 
year 
because its preparation requires much work, Davis said. If it 
is signed, Latvia will be able to plan its economy more 
effectively. 
  Davis said that the underground gas container at Incukalns 
was a strategically important energetics object as the security 
guarantor of the country's gas provision. 
  Latvia could start earning on the container in two years in 
anticipation of soaring gas consumption in Europe because of the 
planned closure of many coal mines. The container could be used 
to store gas before it is sent Europe, Davis said. 
  The Baltics themselves are able to pump Russian gas directly 
in view of the reduction of consumption from 10 billion cubic 
meters in 1991 to 4 billion cubic meters in 1993. 
  Currently, Gazprom stands the sole gas supplier to Latvia 
but 
the Baltic country also contemplates a chance to buy Norwegian 
gas, Davis noted. 
  Commenting on gas purchases from Turkmenistan where it costs 
51 dollar for 1,000 cubic meters, Davis said the transportation 
expenses would increase the price to around 100 dollars for 
1,000 cubic meters. This is the main reason why Turkmenistan 
cannot enter into the European market which is dominated by 
Russia and Norway.

as not conforming to the norms of the code of criminal procedure 
and administrative offense code. 
  The deputies decided the regulations by the cabinet are no 
longer valid.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 12, BNS -- The Latvian Popular Front and 
the Homeland and Freedom association staged a rally Saturday [12 
March] at the Doms square in Riga protesting against the 
temporary operation of the former Soviet military radar 
installation at Skrunda. 
  The round of Latvian-Russian interstate talks, scheduled for 
March 14, can turn out to be the last meeting on troop 
withdrawal, speakers said. 
  The delegations are expected to sign an interstate treaty 
according to which Russia withdraws its troops from Latvia by 
Aug. 31 but Latvia allows it control the Skrunda radar for five 
and a half years. 
  The Popular Front has sent the government several 
resolutions 
urging to not to agree with Russia on such conditions. The 
front's stance is shared by all nationally-oriented political 
organizations, said its Deputy Chairman Juris Kokins. 
  Kokins described the rally as the last means that his 
organization uses to attain quicker dismantling of the radar 
station. 
  In the opinion of the front's specialists, Russia needs the 
radar not as a technical installation but as a military base 
where it could keep its troops and what could be used for 
various political purposes, Kokins said. 
  The existence of a like military base on the Latvian soil is 
unacceptable to the international public opinion. In accordance 
with U.N. resolutions, Russia must get its troops out of Latvia 
speedily, orderly and completely. 
  Kokins conceded that the rally could serve to raise the 
front's political prestige what is important in view of the 
coming local government elections. The front, however, does not 
cherish great hopes for successful performance in the election, 
Kokins said. 
  The rally was attended by around 1,000 people holding 
slogans, like "Russia -- the World's Greatest Racketeer -- Wants 
to Abduct Latvia" and "Skrunda is Occupation Military Base."

  [Text] Riga, Mar 12, BNS -- The Latvian Democratic Labor 
Party in principle approved its new program during the party 
congress Saturday [12 March] in Riga. 
  The program sets the party's stance on the development of 
economy, education, culture, science and human rights but still 
lacks paragraphs on environmental protection and sports, said 
party Chairman Juris Bojars. 
  The party endorses a 10-year residence qualification as 
essential for naturalization until Russia completes the 
withdrawal of its troops from Latvia and the demographic 
situation stabilizes. When the two conditions are fulfilled, 
the residence qualification could be reduced to five years. 
  In economy, the party warns of excessive trading of Latvia's 
property and industrial potential to foreign entrepreneurs. In 
foreign politics, it will seek partners among the world's 
leftist parties.

  [Text] Almaty, 15 Mar -- A big fire has occurred at 
Baykonur cosmodrome. It started in the annex to one of the 
assembly and testing complexes and then spread to the 
headquarters of the military unit serving it. This is reported 
by the republic's press today, quoting news sources. 
  The preliminary damage amounts to some 3 billion rubles. Of 
the technological equipment only the telemetric apparatus 
suffered. At the cosmodrome there is another complex -- a 
back-up one. Experts state that the fire which occurred will 
not affect the execution of the space program. So the launch of 
the next "Progress" cargo spacecraft planned for 18 March will 
not be postponed.

  [Text] Almaty March 15 TASS -- Local press in Kazakhstan 
has reported that a strong fire damaged one of the assembly and 
testing installations and headquarters of a military unit which 
serviced the installation in Baykonur, the former Soviet Union's 
main launching site, now contested by Russia and Kazakhstan. 
  According to informed sources, the preliminary damages 
amount 
to three billion roubles. Fortunately only telemetric devices 
were damaged apart from the buildings. All other technological 
equipment is intact. 
  The cosmodrome has a back-up set of equipment, and although 
the lift-off of the space ferry Progress, scheduled for March 
18, will not be put off, specialists say that the fire will not 
delay the space programme.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Anna Bakina, Vladimir Akimov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow/Almaty, 15 Mar -- In the view of experts, 
the fire at the Baykonur cosmodrome, which occurred on the 
morning of 7 March, will have no effect on the cosmodrome's 
normal work, let alone on the forthcoming launch of the next 
"Progress" cargo spacecraft on 18 March. The fire engulfed an 
extension to the second assembly and testing block (MIK-2). The 
fire gutted five rooms where, in addition to everyday 
appliances, special equipment was housed. Fortunately, the 
cosmodrome has replacement equipment. 
  An ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from the press center of 
the Military Space Forces that the fire could have been caused 
by a faulty electrical appliance or carelessness with fire. In 
general, staff negligence was to blame. 
  The fire is not the only sorry event at the cosmodrome 
recently. A little earlier, an officers' garrison building 
burned down here. This kind of incident seems to becoming usual 
at Baykonur. However, extinguishing fires has to be done under 
extreme conditions: there is an acute water shortage at the 
complex. Added to that, the approach routes, both road and 
rail, become blocked by snow which often prevents even lorries 
carrying food from getting through to the cosmodrome. 
  However, the situation has another side as well. Replying to 
a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent, it was stated at the 
press centre of the Military Space Forces that it is now simply 
unprofitable to deliver new vehicles and equipment to Baykonur 
because, under the present circumstances, everything that comes 
on to the territory of Kazakhstan automatically becomes the 
property of that state. The signing of the relevant treaty on 
the status and future of the cosmodrome is being dragged out 
because of disagreements between Kazakhstan and Russia over 
leasing period and the size of rental payments.

Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev signed a decree on Monday 
to ratify the agreement establishing a common economic space 
between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan which was concluded in 
Tashkent in January 1994. 
  Both countries have abolished customs check points to 
encourage free movement of goods across the border. As a 
result, the prices of food in local market places in the Kazakh 
town of Shymkent located close to the Uzbek capital are lower 
than those in state-run shops. Enterprises of the two republics 
are also boosting direct ties.

  [Text] We have already reported that last Saturday a 
meeting of the chairmen of the Supreme Soviets of Armenia and 
Azerbaijan was held on the Armenian-Azerbaijani border. Today 
the head of the Armenian parliament held a news conference on 
its results. 
  [Correspondent Vladimir Nazaryan] Having simply described 
the 
meeting on the border as a useful and constructive one, Babken 
Araktsyan informed journalists of the contents of the 
conversation that took place in every detail. The main thing 
that both sides agree upon is that there is an urgent necessity 
for a lasting truce in the region which would make political 
dialogue possible. Mutual understanding was achieved with 
regard to the issue of the Lachin humanitarian corridor which 
will be in place even when a separating buffer zone is created 
around Nagorno-Karabakh. As a unilateral initiative and without 
any preconditions, Armenia is ready to allow Azerbaijan to use 
its communications to transfer necessary electric power and 
freight to Nakhichevan. This would allow the unfounded 
accusations regarding the blockade of this autonomous republic 
by Armenia to be dropped.

  [Text] We already reported in our previous newscasts today 
that the situation on our borders has remained relatively calm 
since yesterday noon. The Armenian Defense Ministry press 
service just reported that the relative calm was still 
prevailing at 1600. 
  The relative calm established over the last few days is 
still 
being maintained on most of the Karabakh war fronts. However, 
Karabakh's positions are still coming under fire in a number of 
sectors. But no casualties are being reported. Thus, Karabakh 
forces' positions north of Martuninskiy came under shelling from 
various guns this morning. The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic 
Defense Army headquarters said that there was no retaliatory 
fire. A concentration of Azerbaijani troops and equipment is 
being observed along most of the war front, in particular on the 
eastern and southeastern sectors.

  [Text] Parliamentary Chairman of Armenia Babken Ararktsyan 
speaking in Yerevan has denied that the question of troop 
withdrawal from Armenian-held parts of Azeri territory was on 
the agenda of Saturday's meeting with his Azeri counterpart 
Rasul Guliyev. His negative answer came in response to a 
question from an Interfax correspondent asking whether or not he 
promised Guliyev to withdraw Armenian forces within 20 days as 
Baku was alleging. 
  At the same time, Ararktsyan said the withdrawal of troops 
was envisaged by the CSCE-proposed peace plan of last November 
which both Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh had approved. 
  He called for the Lachin corridor linking Armenia with the 
disputed territory to remain intact. 
  Ararktsyan spoke of the two sides' renewed commitment to a 
regional peace settlement. But for this to happen, he said, any 
talks on Nagorno-Karabakh must follow a durable regional 
cease-fire. 
  He stressed the need for the enclave to be made party to 
regional peace talks. 
  Ararktsyan spoke of offering his Azeri counterpart to reopen 
Armenian roads for Azeri shipments of cargoes and fuel to 
Nakhichevan as a way of "restoring mutual trust and ending 
charges about Armenia blocking" that Azeri enclave. 
  State Secretary of Azerbaijan Gabil Huseinli [name as 
received] maintains that the Armenian side had offered promises 
of withdrawing its troops from occupied Azeri territories within 
the next 20 days, at Saturday's meeting between parliamentary 
leaders of the two countries. 
  In an interview with Interfax, he said the Armenian pullout 
would be done in two stages. Initially, the warring sides are 
to withdraw troops at a distance of 10 km to 15 km away from the 
engagement line, observers are to be moved into the buffer zone 
and refugees are to be returned to their homes simultaneously. 
  Huseinli said that if Armenia kept up its promise by 
relinquishing at least part of the annexed territory as a 
goodwill gesture, the prospect of an Azeri-Armenian summit would 
become ever more real. He said the territory to be relinquished 
was outside Nagorno-Karabakh while the Lachin corridor linking 
the enclave and mainland Armenia would remain under Armenian 
control. In the meantime, Lachin and the Karabakh city of 
Shusha, whose population was mainly Azeri before the conflict 
broke out, are to be discussed during talks on the future of the 
disputed territory, he said. 
  Huseinli said Baku preferred CSCE-brokered talks on regional 
peace though praising Moscow's mediation in the peace process 
despite its traditional support for Armenia.

  [Text] Baku (March 14) TURAN--"Recently the defence 
ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan will begin drafting a 
ceasefire agreement", said Rasul Guliyev, Azerbaijan's Speaker 
of Parliament, during a press-conference held in Gazakh. The 
press-conference was held following his meeting with Babken 
Ararktsyan, the Armenian Speaker of Parliament. 
  Rasul Guliyev also said that a verbal agreement had been 
achieved and according to the agreement Armenian military units 
must withdraw from the occupied territories of Fizulinskiy, 
Dzhebrailskiy, Zangelanskiy, Kubatlinskiy and certain sections 
of Lachinskiy within twenty days after the signing of the 
agreement signed. It is expected that the agreement will 
require the Armenian forces to retreat inward from the Karabakh 
border by ten kilometres. At the same time Azeri forces are 
expected to move their forces by ten kilometres in the opposite 
direction, thereby creating a buffer zone where international 
observers will be stationed. Rasul Guliyev also noted that 
opposes the relocation of separate forces in the territory of 
Karabakh. [sentences as received] 
  He also noted that the Lachin corridor would still be 
controlled by Karabakh Armenians for the purposes of 
communication. At the same time, Armenia will be required to 
end the blocade preventing communication between Nakhichevan and 
the rest of Azerbaijan. 
  As soon as the agreement goes into effect, both sides will 
discuss the status of Upper Karabakh [Nagorno-Karabakh]. Rasul 
Guliyev didn't tell that whether the discussion would be 
conducted in the frame of the Minsk group of CSCE or not. 
  Remarkably, Rasul Guliyev didn't mentioned the 
Kelbadzharskiy 
and Agdamskiy regions' setting free from Armenian forces. 
Though earlier the government leaders stated the freedom of all 
the occupied territories. 
  As the observers in Baku note the conditions of the peaceful 
settlement which Rasul Guliyev notified in Gazakh was proposed 
by Moscow. Earlier, Baku opposed this plan and considered it 
"humiliating". However, Moscow has refused to amend the 
settlement plan and Azerbaijan was obliged to accept it. 
  In light of this, Russia has taken the next successful step 
towards consolidating Transcaucasia. At the same time, CSCE 
appears to fulfill the role as on-looker in the region.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Baku Azerbaycan Radio Televiziyasi 
Television Network in Azeri at 1640 GMT carries a 60-minute 
"extensive report" by correspondent Gulsefa Ahmedova on the 9 
March "expanded consultative meeting," attended by deputies and 
government and regional officials, held at the Supreme Soviet 
and chaired by Speaker Rasul Guliyev. The report includes 
recorded excerpts of the meeting. 
  Ahmedova begins her report by saying that the meeting 
discussed the military and political situation in the republic, 
problems connected with the creation of the Army, and measures 
to end the war. 
  In a recorded excerpt, Guliyev says: "Azerbaijan has been 
holding talks at the international level and directly with the 
Armenians for the peaceful resolution of the military conflict 
with Armenia. Although there are certain achievements in this 
regard, they have not yet been implemented. As you know, a 
protocol was signed on 18 February 1994 between the Armenia and 
Azerbaijani defense ministers with the participation of the 
Russian Federation. According to this document, the fighting was 
to end by 1 March; Armenia's Armed Forces were to withdraw from 
Nagorno-Karabakh within three days; and, in accordance with our 
own variant, they were to free the occupied Azerbaijani lands 
within 14 days. Recently, we received international 
representatives from the Minsk Group under Eliasson. First, the 
republic's president met them and then I held talks with them 
for a few hours. They said that Azerbaijan's position is 
correct and hoped the Armenians would accept it. They first met 
us in Baku, then left for Khankendi [Stepanakert] in 
Nagorno-Karabakh and Yerevan. We were apprehensive that after 
their visits to Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia they might have 
changed their views. However, I want to inform you that despite 
their visits there they have not changed their views and are 
supporting our own variant and position. 
  "As always, the Armenians exploited our aspiration for peace 
and resumed their attacks [words indistinct] mostly in the south 
in Fizulinskiy Rayon. Bloody battles have continued there the 
last few days. The Azerbaijani Army is dealing the necessary 
reply to the Armenian aggressors. Armenians have suffered 
considerable losses and are unable to achieve anything. 
  "At around 1900 yesterday, the Chairman of the Armenian 
Parliament Babken Ararktsyan phoned me and told me that he 
wishes to meet me to resolve this conflict. I replied that we 
have always favored the peaceful resolution of the problem and I 
am ready for talks anywhere, be it in Moscow, Yerevan, Idzhevan, 
or in any foreign country. We decided that we should meet on 
the border of Kazakhskiy and Idzhevanskiy Rayons on 12 March to 
search for ways to peacefully resolve this war. 
  "The Azerbaijani Republic and its people must deeply 
understand one thing: The future and destiny of Azerbaijan 
rests solely in the hands of the Azerbaijani people and 
citizens. No one, be they close neighbors or friendly countries 
elsewhere, will solve the Azerbaijani people's problems. For 
this reason, we must have a strong army and internal unity, must 
mobilize our economic potential, and deal decisive and 
courageous blows to the enemy. Such blows will bring peace 
closer. The opposing side will bow and opt for peace only when 
faced with force. There is no other alternative." 
  Guliyev also says that the Azerbaijani side rejected the 
disengagement plan because it would place people behind the 
lines and under threat. 
  He then goes on to strongly criticize the TURAN news agency 
for publishing reports that freedoms in Azerbaijan are being 
suppressed. 
  Resuming her report, Ahmedova says that the speakers 
complained that the troops are not receiving their wages on time 
and spoke on measures to establish discipline in the Army and 
prevent desertions. 
  In a recorded excerpt, Prosecutor-General Ali Omerov says 
the 
Defense Ministry is responsible for the increase in desertions. 
He accuses the military commissars for criminal behavior in 
this regard. He also accuses the TURAN news agency for its 
distorted reports on the seizure of arms from the People's Front 
headquarters. He said TURAN should publish reports on "objective 
reality," or face legal measures. 
  In another recorded excerpt, the military prosecutor says 
that the main reason for desertions is that "the combat 
readiness is not up to the desired level." He says in some 
cases the commanders are telling the soldiers to flee so that 
they too could flee from the front. Therefore, he says, first 
of all the training of the military cadres should be improved. 
  Guliyev interjects and says: "Every one of you have sinned 
before the Azerbaijani state and people. You must all realize 
this. And the actions of some of you are criminal in nature. 
You should know this. You should not think that we are not 
following your actions. We fully know everything you are 
involved in. You have come here to discuss what concrete 
measures to take. If the talk is about desertions, you must 
openly state, for example, that the deserters should be in a 
certain location within two days. Therefore, you should talk 
about concrete military measures you want to implement to 
speedily extract the Azerbaijan Republic from its present 
situation. If you want, you can also express your political 
views." 
  Guliyev goes on to say that there cannot be internal 
divisions when it concerns Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. 
He again indirectly criticizes TURAN's reports as acts of 
"enmity" against Azerbaijan. He says everybody in the hall are 
to be blamed for desertions. He ascribes the desertions to the 
fact that young people have not been imbued enough with feelings 
of patriotism. He also criticizes those present for their lack 
of ideas on economic reforms. He says economic reforms, 
primarily in agriculture, should be launched courageously in 
each rayon. 
  He supports the proposal that the Defense Ministry should 
report to parliament within three or four days that it has 
resolved the problem of desertions. 
  He indirectly criticizes certain people for trying to 
exploit 
the war for their own interests. He calls on the 
prosecutor-general and military tribunal to publicize 
information in papers and on the television on this so "people 
could see and recognize its enemies."

consultations and preparations concerning documents on the 
unification of the Belarusian and Russian monetary systems have 
been completed. By now, these documents are in the hands of the 
Russian prime minister, who is going to discuss them with a 
number of political factions in the State Duma of the Russian 
Federation. U. Zamyatalin said that, according to preliminary 
information, the majority of Duma deputies view the signing of 
the monetary union agreement between the two states with 
optimism. "Some disagreements over approaches to the creation 
of a single ruble zone are of more political, than economic 
character; they are artificially created by those experts who 
have been programmed to prevent, at any price, the establishment 
of a union of the two countries," said Kebich's press secretary. 
Speaking about the actual date of the monetary unification, 
Zamyatalin expressed hope that "it will most likely take place 
before the end of March."

  [Text] The People's Movement of Belarus Coordinative 
Committee [KKNDB] has appealed to political parties, 
organizations, and all people of good will, "to whom the fate of 
nations is precious," to proclaim 17 March 1994 as a day of 
united action aimed at restoring the USSR. 
  According to the authors of the "Appeal to Nations of the 
Former USSR," which RID has recently received, this day should 
mark the beginning of activities aimed at a voluntary 
restoration of the USSR. Over the last three years since the 17 
March 1991 referendum, reads the document, people have realized 
"that they have been sold for the benefit of international 
capital and interests of the United States; deprived of the 
united motherland, friendship, peace, and accord; and thrown 
into the abyss of war, lawlessness, and spiritual and material 
impoverishment, and that the country has been reduced to a zone 
of cheap labor, raw materials, and `dirty' production, as well 
as a dumping ground for industrial waste." 
  The KKNDB believes that at rallies, meetings, and pickets on 
17 March, people should categorically voice demands to fulfill 
their will, which was expressed three years ago and ignored by 
"the democrats and national-extremists" who came to power.

  [Text] BELAPAN has learned that the legislative commission 
for state building has elaborated a draft law on presidential 
elections in the Republic of Belarus. According to the 
document, the presidential election will be held based on the 
general, equal, and direct electoral law in the form of a secret 
ballot. If this provision is approved by the Supreme Soviet, 
the election will be closed to citizens found incapable by a 
court decision as well as citizens who are incarcerated or held 
in custody. The draft also says that only Belarusian citizens 
over 35 years of age are eligible to vote, and only those who 
have lived in the Republic for at least 10 years can be elected. 
The president's term of office would last five years. At the 
same time, the same person cannot be elected for more than two 
terms. 
  According to the document, candidacies for the Belarusian 
president will be put forward by at least 70 legislative 
deputies as well as by Belarusian citizens, who must collect at 
least 100,000 signatures of the electors. All expenses 
connected with the organization of the election are covered by 
the state budget. The commission for state building suggested 
that the submission of presidential candidates should start in 
75 days. The Central Electoral Commission has to register an 
initiative group in charge of collecting signatures for 
presidential candidates within five days. Lists of the 
signatures are to be submitted to rayon, city, or city district 
electoral commissions at least 55 days before the election. So, 
simple calculation shows that the legislative commission 
considers two weeks or so a sufficient time for collecting 
100,000 signatures from citizens.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yu. Kosolapov, an expert of the Belarusian </F>
Cabinet of Ministers Department for Coordinating Activities of 
Administrative Bodies, by A. Bezveselnyy; place and date not 
given: "Modern Ostap Benders"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Bezveselnyy] You have 
mentioned an important problem such as the destruction and 
recycling of weapons and military equipment. How will Belarus 
benefit from the successful resolution of this problem? 
  [Kosolapov] As a matter of fact, some of these weapons pose 
a threat to the people and environment. Despite a limited 
budget, the Defense Ministry has managed to find possibilities 
for financing appropriate scientific-research and 
experimental-design works in the interest of the Belarusian 
Armed Forces. The first results of this work can now be 
summarized. 
  According to specialists' estimates, the implementation of 
the project for recycling rocket fuel Melanzh alone will make it 
possible to develop a competitive technology, profit more than 1 
billion Russian rubles, and resolve a whole range of ecological 
and other problems. 
  At the 43d Defense Ministry repair-mechanical plant near 
Dobrush, recycling of weapons useless for combat is being 
launched. It is expected that more than 50,000 pieces of 
dangerous weapons will be reprocessed by 1997, which will 
significantly contribute to resolving the issues of 
environmental security and the problems of explosive materials 
in the republic, as well as turning a considerable profit. 
  There is another very interesting example. At Belarusian 
aircraft-repair plants and other aviation industry facilities, 
active work is currently being conducted to develop the aircraft 
Belarus in cooperation with Russia and Kazakhstan. 
Additionally, this is accompanied by considerable activity in 
international cooperation regarding conversion. This, however, 
is a topic for another conversation. 
  [Bezveselnyy] Yuriy Georgiyevich, apparently, the 
situation with the conversion is not so bad, despite certain 
skeptics' complaints. 
  [Kosolapov] Exactly. Officials from the Defense Ministry 
and the Cabinet of Ministers understand very well that there are 
many political, socioeconomic, and scientific problems hampering 
the conversion of military facilities. Many of these problems 
are of an interdepartmental nature. Therefore, the Cabinet of 
Ministers believes that it is necessary to develop new 
organizational forms and methods to improve this process, and to 
implement the government conversion program more efficiently.

  [Text] A meeting of Belarusian and U.S. officials at the 
Defense Ministry level began in Minsk today. Delegations from 
the two countries will discuss a number of acute problems facing 
Belarus. These problems, first of all, concern difficulties 
Belarus is encountering in dismantling military equipment and 
the need to reclaim and return land that was cleared following 
reductions in our own troops and the withdrawal of foreign ones. 
According to our information, the U.S. delegation has come to 
Minsk with a package of proposals which can be used to adopt 
measures aimed at resolving the above-mentioned problems. The 
results of the meeting will be made known in a week's time.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 15 TASS -- The Federation Council 
(upper house of the Russian parliament) put the item on the 
prosecutor-general on the agenda of its fourth session which 
opened on Tuesday. 
  Issa Kostoyev, chairman of the council committee on 
constitutional legislation, explained at the discussion of this 
proposal that the chamber is to receive representations from the 
Russian president on the resignation of the former 
prosecutor-general and the appointment of the new one in order 
to debate this issue. 
  "We cannot examine this issue without such representations," 
he noted. The chairman called legislators' attention to the 
fact that the Federation Council regulations contain no article 
on how such issues should be examined. 
  The agenda of today's session contains such an item on the 
procedure of debating by the chamber issues relegated by the 
constitution to its competence. Deputies decided that the item 
should be examined to be ready to discuss the president's 
representations. 
  There were also proposals to consider the situation with 
Aleksey Kazannik's resignation, since the new constitution 
envisages that the prosecutor-general's appointments and 
resignations are to be approved by the Federation Council. As a 
result, this item on the agenda reads as follows: "On 
prosecutor-general". 
  Lawmakers also decided to hear a report by the Russian 
premier on non-payments and the government's programme on how to 
do away with them. The crisis of non-payments was discussed at 
parliamentary hearings on Monday where legislators recognised 
them as a very serious problem affecting the entire financial 
and budgetary system of the country. 
  Parliamentarians also decided to hear information from the 
Russian Foreign Ministry (in the section "Miscellaneous") on 
treaties which were concluded but not ratified. The proposal 
was prompted by a question of whether the Russian-Georgian 
treaty which has not been ratified by the lower chamber for the 
time being, operates or not. 
  Legislators continue discussing the agenda.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Yermolin report: "Duma Ponders President's </F>
Message"] 
  [Text] After a short vacation the State Duma began 
discussing the Russian president's message "On Strengthening the 
Russian State" right away Friday. 
  In a rounded and well-composed report Ivan Rybkin, speaker 
of 
the lower chamber, voiced a largely positive opinion of the 
message and called for constructive work based on the 
president's proposals. He said that a number of points in the 
message "can and should be disputed," but there were obvious 
points with which he could not fail to agree. These included 
the reform of the Army or, to be more accurate, the deepening 
and completion of that reform. 
  The report was also couched in such a way as to not cause 
tremendous dispute either in the center or on the flanks. 
Misunderstanding arose only over why the president needed 
another memorandum of accord in society when the Duma has 
already adopted such a memorandum. Ivan Rybkin explained that 
in this case an extra initiative was not an obstacle but an 
"added bonus." But it was visible from the reaction in the hall 
that the question of whose memorandum is "more valid" is 
nonetheless exercising some people in the Duma. Paradoxically 
enough Russia may yet see a war of "peace initiatives." 
Evidently foreseeing that danger, Ivan Rybkin came up with a 
global idea for reconciliation. He proposed convening an 
All-Russia congress of all political forces. 
  The tone of conciliation and cooperation which Rybkin tried 
to set in his report seems to have gone unnoticed by many people. 
  The debate on the president's message is scheduled to fill a 
whole working day for the Duma.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mikhail Mityukov, deputy chairman of the </F>
Russian Federation Federal Assembly State Duma, under the 
"Politics" rubric: "Accord on Civil Peace Is a Response to 
Society's Demand"] 
  [Text] I am certain that there are good prospects for the 
accord on civil peace which the president has suggested should 
be signed. It is hard to object to the actual idea -- in 
principle, all parties, groups, and factions loudly declare that 
they advocate consolidation, cooperation, civil peace, and 
accord. The agreement proposes finding common points of contact 
and determining the principles on which the agreement will be 
based, the commitments that the government and other state 
organs will assume, and the commitments that parties, trade 
unions, and public organizations will take on themselves. To 
oppose this idea would be to oppose the opinion prevailing among 
the population that it is time to end confrontation, that peace 
and accord are needed. The agreement on civil peace should not 
just be a declaration. Having named the points of contact and 
common aims and tasks, the president should also propose both a 
mechanism for implementing the agreement and the sides' 
commitments and the specific political responsibility of those 
who sign the memorandum. An extensive circle of participants 
will be invited to sign, that is, representatives of at least 
100 public organizations, political parties, trade unions, and 
religious faiths as well as the power structures -- the 
president, the government, the Federal Assembly chambers, and 
the Constitutional Court. That is the intention. As a 
politician I believe that to oppose it, refusing to participate 
in the memorandum on accord, would be to demonstrate political 
ambitions which are far from the people's true interests.

<F P=106> [Transcript of remarks by Pavel Bunich, deputy chairman of </F>
the State Duma Committee on Property, Privatization, and 
Economic Activity, carried under the "At the State Duma" rubric; 
date not given: "How To Reconcile the Irreconcilable"] 
  [Text] I think that sensible people should be a little 
reassured by the president's recent Message to the Federal 
Assembly and the subsequent enlarged session of the Council of 
Ministers. After the cabinet shake-up, the departure of several 
key figures from it, and a worryingly long pause by the premier 
the president and the cabinet head have made it clear that the 
course of reforms remains as before. The government does not 
intend to give in to pressure from sector lobbies which cause 
momentary embarrassment in the upper echelons or heed the advice 
of economic authorities fervently convinced that for the time 
being the market is not for us -- that the road to the market is 
a long and winding one that lies in some other dimension 
altogether. 
  It is typical that both Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin recalled 
the 
program drafted last August, dismissing once again, as it were, 
the charges of unfocused, chaotic drift. If the program is a 
course (and it is), serious deviations really will not be seen, 
although modifications will have to be made to practice. Who 
could have planned, for example, for state orders not being paid 
for, for wages not paid out on time, or for those in the 
budget-financed sphere being so badly hurt. On the contrary, it 
was stressed that their incomes would grow almost in parallel 
with prices. It did not work out. It is now time to pay for 
past sins, and for virtually all of them at the same time. It 
has been stated that the government will in the very near future 
settle its accounts with the countryside, the defense sector, 
the miners, and the budget-financed sphere. Major credits have 
been promised on the surety of the spring sowing. Compensation 
for the population's savings will continue to be paid. All this 
will, of course, whip up inflation, but the new cabinet cannot 
be blamed for that. The third act of the drama has come, and it 
is time to fire the gun hanging on the wall. We have been able 
to see for ourselves once again that you can have the very best 
of intentions but you will build nothing durable on the basis of 
unreliability and disregard of the law. If the government has 
decided finally to clear its debts, its determination can only 
be welcomed. 
  It is important not to overshoot the mark; it is important 
to 
keep a clear sense of proportion. Some people are asking that 
not just the budget debt but suppliers too be repaid. However, 
carrying out mutual settlement on the 1992 model means 
delivering a very heavy blow to the reforms. Others propose 
that working capital be indexed -- that is to say, you add 
several zeros to their value and then quietly slip that gain 
into wages. This has happened. We have experienced it. It is 
senseless to repeat it. It is not difficult to predict that new 
subsidies and cheap loans will be demanded from the government. 
Enterprises' market muscles have just begun to develop, and we 
are again providing them with hot-house conditions wherein they 
have to compete against no one for anything and where the young 
musculature will grow flaccid within a couple of weeks through 
not being wanted. And all this under the slogan of combating 
the reduction in output, of trying not to give way. Give way, 
and you will not keep inflation down. 
  The 1994 draft budget is screwed down so tightly that you 
can hear the nuts squeaking. By tradition we do everything 
late. There are, it is true, nuances here. In the past we 
would simply fail to pay money to, say, the Army or the northern 
regions and then say: We will be making cutbacks. Such methods 
generated a wave of discontent -- society and the economy cannot 
be treated that way. First you plan what you will cut, you 
agree this, you make arrangements, and you cut whatever it is; 
then you make your expenditure savings. It is clear from the 
draft budget what will be curtailed and slimmed down. But time 
passes, and it gets lost again. If all the cuts had been 
announced at least one quarter ago.... I fear that it will be 
necessary to pay more than planned. Inflation will be not 3-5 
percent by the end of the year but much higher -- given the 
payment of debts, prices will increase roughly fourfold, by my 
estimates. And that is at best, if the government avoids the 
aforementioned pitfalls toward which some people are stubbornly 
egging it on. 
  Unfortunately the session said little about overcoming the 
investment crisis. This topic was touched on to a certain 
extent by Basin, chairman of the State Committee on Issues of 
Construction and Architecture. Revaluing fixed capital, he 
reported, will increase deductions set aside for depreciation to 
40 trillion rubles [R]. But the problem is that enterprises 
will shamelessly consume this money and use it for wages. Basin 
suggested that we introduce separate accounts for depreciation, 
as was done in the past. I do not think that is enough. Tax is 
not levied on depreciation as distinct from wages paid out of 
profit or prime costs, and strictness here is therefore 
justified. Let them return everything they have consumed to the 
depreciation fund and then pay a fine in addition. The pointer 
of economic interest will then shift in the direction we desire 
and enterprises will be forced to think about the future. 
  There is in general a strange prejudice abroad that no one 
will want to resort to investment under inflation conditions. 
Quite the reverse. They want to. They very much want to. It 
is precisely during inflation that investment is the best way to 
save money. Land and real estate are self-indexing, as it were. 
That the price confusion makes life difficult and that almost 
everything goes on wages is another issue. Last year only 15 
out of 600 facilities under the state capital investment plan 
were commissioned. But what is significant here is that private 
and joint-stock enterprises, where one's own, nonstate assets 
increase, have a totally different attitude to investment. 
One-third of them are modernizing, expanding, and making 
improvements -- that is to say, are in some way participating in 
the investment process. And I am encouraged by the thought that 
by 1 July, when voucher privatization is completed, around 80 
percent of state property will be joint stock or in private 
ownership. In other words, approximately 80 percent of 
enterprises will receive an investment incentive. There may be 
no money to start with, but there will be an incentive. And 
with time there will be money too. 
  Incidentally, privatized enterprises have the right to 
obtain 
money on the security of their own property. The law on surety 
has been adopted, but a number of normative acts are required if 
it is to work. 
  And why not consider investment concessions -- credit for 
investment needs which will be granted against specific business 
plans on a case-by-case basis rather than for whole sectors, as 
is current practice? This is an active state policy which is 
not even to be seen in embryonic form. 
  I understand the difficult conditions in which the current 
budget has been drafted, and I am ready to resign myself 
philosophically to many things. Yet one feature does produce a 
sense of inner protest. Expenditure has determined the budget, 
and no weight has been placed on the other side of the scales, 
the revenue side, to counterbalance it. But, you know, you 
cannot go on like that forever, because by contracting 
expenditure you also cut back future revenue and reduce the tax 
base. Something has to grow, to ripen, and yield fruit, and 
this "something" must be identified by the state in good time 
and, if need be, supported. But it seems to me that we are 
reverting to discussion of investment policy.
