  [Text] The Tajik armed opposition will stop fighting if 
peace talks between Dushanbe and the opposition are successful, 
Chairman of the Coordinating Center of Tajik Democratic Forces 
Atakhon Latifi told Interfax on Monday. 
  He said the opposition is not interested in a continuation 
of 
the civil war and does not want Tajikistan to become another 
Afghanistan. Latifi noted that currently preparations for the 
talks are going on. The talks will be held in Moscow, however 
the exact date is yet unknown. 
  Asked by Interfax's correspondent what demands the 
opposition 
put forward before the Dushanbe authorities, Latifi noted that 
the Council of National Accord, consisting of people who have 
not been involved in the civil war, should come to power 
temporarily. In Latifi's opinion, this government should 
conduct preparations for elections of a new parliament and do 
everything possible for the return of a million and a half 
refugees to their homeland. 
  Latifi pointed out that only after that it would be possible 
to hold elections and adopt a new constitution.

  [Text] Russia intends to do everything possible to 
facilitate the negotiations between the leadership of Tajikistan 
and the opposition, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
declared on arrival in Dushanbe from Vladivostok today. Another 
important task for Russia is to support Tajikistan as a CIS 
state, the minister said. 
  Kozyrev is meeting in Dushanbe today with the Tajik foreign 
minister and the foreign ministers of a number of other Central 
Asian states. He pointed out in particular that there must be 
no wrecking of the negotiations with the opposition as happened 
last week following the killing of Deputy Prime Minister 
Nazarshoyev. Kozyrev is convinced that, together with the Tajik 
leadership, he will succeed in settling this issue, INTERFAX 
reports.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 49: Compiled </F>
by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] On March 11 Chairman of the Belarusian Supreme 
Council Mechyslaw Hryb met with permanent representatives of the 
republics and heads of the CIS executive secretariats' 
subdivisions at the CIS headquarters in Minsk. 
  In an interview with Interfax, the Executive Secretary of 
the 
Commonwealth Ivan Korotchenya said that "the meeting which was 
later joined by the Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich 
was of a familiarizing character." According to Korotchenya, 
the new head of the parliament decided to familiarize with 
representatives of the CIS states in person and to hear their 
opinion on the activities of the executive secretariat. 
  Kortochenya said that during the meeting Hryb expressed 
readiness to propose at the next CIS summit the construction of 
a new building for the Commonwealth headquarters in Minsk. The 
blue prints have already been designed, and the city authorities 
have found a suitable construction site. Kebich decided that 
the building of the former regional committee of the Belarusian 
Communist Party will be leased by the CIS Executive Secretariat, 
which currently occupies the building. 
  In the opinion of Korotchenya, the meeting focused on 
approaches to the preparations and the signing of an agreement 
between the Belarusian government and the CIS Executive 
Secretariat which, in his words, regulates "a whole set of 
problems regarding the location of the CIS headquarters in Minsk 
and the recognition by Belarus of the executive secretariat as 
an international organization." "Hryb also expressed the 
readiness of the Belarusian side to carry out the construction 
of the administrative building and apartment houses under the 
condition that there was a coordinated approach by the CIS 
states to their financing," Korotchenya said. 
  Asked about the funding of the CIS Executive Secretariat, 
Korotchenya said that "some states delay the remittance of money 
for maintaining the coordinating structures of the 
Commonwealth," declining to name them. 
  According to Korotchenya, "the date for the next CIS summit, 
to be held approximately around April 18-19 in Moscow is being 
discussed." 
  Interfax learned that Hryb and Korotchenya intend to take 
part in a conference of the European Interparliamentary Union 
scheduled for March 21-26 in Paris. 
  According to sources in the Belarusian Supreme Council, a 
delegation of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly to the Paris 
conference will be led by head of the Russian Federation Council 
Vladimir Shumeyko. 
  The agenda of the conference will include a discussion of 
the 
role and means of the UN in the prevention of international 
conflicts, environmental protection, as well as general debates 
on the political, economic and social situation in the world.

  [Text] Moscow March 15 TASS -- ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the 
decree, signed by President Boris Yeltsin on March 10, on 
respondibility for infringing the labour rights of citizens". 
The decree envisages, in particular, punishment for those 
guilty of delays in the payment of wages and salaries. 
  "Failure to pay wages, like rust, erodes the entire economic 
mechanism. It has ceased to be risky and has become an 
economically lucrative thing not to foot bills". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI comments on a draft memorandum on civil 
peace and accord. Preparation of such a memo was the subject of 
the Russian president's meeting with representatives from 
parties and public movements, the parliament and government in 
the Kremlin recently. 
  "However, can a document, even such a substantial and 
representative as this one, keep the country from slipping down 
into chaos?" the newspaper asks and provides the answer: "It is 
unlikely. All depends on whether the leading political and 
public forces of the country that have influence among the 
masses really intend to make every effort to maintain civil 
peace or this is just a tactical manoeuvre for someone". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) runs a column of replies, under 
the general headline "The State has a Future if the Rising 
Generation Chooses Patriotism", by participants in a recent 
roundtable meeting here about the education of young people in 
the spirit of patriotism. 
  "Our country has got a kind of 'black hole' in this respect, 
with cruelty, cynicism, all-crushing nihilism, and the lack of 
spirituality drifting in from it". 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA on the problems of children's homes, 
orphanages and special schools. 
  "Ninety per cent less attention is now given to children in 
boarding schools than during the stagnation period". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with outstanding 
chess player Anatoliy Karpov who said, in view of his triumph in 
Linares: "To me, the triumph in the tournament is both an honour 
and self- affirmation as world champion and an evidence of 
unabated strength". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA maintains that the Russian Federation's 
accession to NATO's Partnership-for-Peace programme "would 
enhance russia's isolation and sharply limit its freedom for 
foreign-policy manoeuvring". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, touching upon the forthcoming 8th 
international aerospace show, the Fidae-94, to be held in the 
capital of Chile on March 20-27, quotes Axel Cabrera, Chilean 
consul in the Russian Federation, as saying that the success of 
the Fidae-94 "is predetermined by Russia's participation". 
  TRUD analyses the causes of the failure of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian talks on a political settlement of the 
conflict. The newspaper sees a real way out of the crisis in 
Abkhazia's signing a confederative treaty with Georgia, a treaty 
under which each side would be declared sovereign and a subject 
of international law. 
  PRAVDA runs an interview with Tajikistan Parliament Chief 
Emomali Rakhmonov who believes that his country should have 
armed forces of its own. SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA carries an 
interview with writer Yuriy Bondarev on the eve of his 70th 
birthday. The newspaper singles out the writer's words "that 
Russia has its own path in world history, a unique one achieved 
through suffering".

unifying customs legislation and mechanisms for tariff and 
nontariff regulation and simplifying customs procedures; 
bringing tariffs for the interstate transportation of goods and 
passengers into closer line with each other while observing the 
principle of freedom of transit. 
<H6>  Article 5 </H6>
  Each party recognizes that the other possesses a national 
currency and will use every possible means to promote the

central and commercial banks of the Republic of Uzbekistan and 
the Russian Federation.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 12, BNS -- Russia has made no promises to 
Estonia and Latvia about withdrawing its troops from those 
countries by Aug. 31, 1994, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vitaliy Churkin said in an interview with the Latvia-based Diena 
newspaper. 
  The Russian diplomat admitted, however, that Moscow has not 
officially refused to pull out its troops. 
  Churkin said the Russian Foreign Ministry has adopted a new 
tactical line, that of ignoring Baltic diplomats' critical 
statements. "At the recent sessions of the Council of Europe 
Security Council and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council 
(Russian Foreign Minister Andrey) Kozyrev didn't say a word 
about his Baltic colleagues, although we don't see eye to eye 
with them on a number of issues, including observance of human 
rights," he said. 
  Churkin assured that, as an official in charge of relations 
with the Baltic states at the Russian Foreign Ministry, he has 
"no evil intentions" with regard to those countries, and 
promised to do his best in seeking concrete solutions to the 
problems that have cropped up.

  [Text] We begin with a report from Moscow by correspondent 
Ritums Rozenbergs in which he says that at the end of the first 
day of the Latvian-Russian talks, Latvian delegation chief 
Martins Virsis said that two things were not coordinated. One 
about payment for rent of the Skrunda military facility and the 
other one concerning the wording of the text of the agreement. 
However, in spite of the disagreements, there is hope that an 
agreement will be reached in the nearest future, possibly today. 
  The main achievement of yesterday's talks is an agreement 
prepared for signing on the army withdrawal and two agreements 
on social guarantees for the Russian military. It has been 
agreed in the document that pensions will be paid to Soviet army 
pensioners, that is, to those who had become pensioners by 
January `92. A new stage is characteristic of this round of 
talks, because documents which have been discussed for several 
years have practically been prepared for signing.

  [Text] Daugavpils, Latvia, Mar 14, BNS -- The Russian army 
Command and the Latvian Daugavpils region administration signed 
the handover-takeover papers of a former Soviet military 
airfield at Lociki. 
  The parties agreed on all paragraphs of the document except 
on the material value of the airfield compound. They decided to 
view the issue separately. 
  The Russian military persons assess the total value of all 
installations at 9 billion Russian rubles, or around 5.2 million 
U.S. dollars. Latvia, however, prices the compound at 4 billion 
Russian rubles, or 2.3 million dollars. 
  The sums have to be coordinated by the Northwest Army Group 
command and the Latvian Finance Ministry. 
  The local authorities claim that the Lociki airfield was the 
last Russian military installation in the Daugavpils region.

  [Text] The Hague, 14 Mar -- The integration of the 
Russian-speaking population into a society with a diverse 
culture is the main condition for stable internal development in 
Latvia and for the establishment of the necessary neighborly 
relations with Russia, Ruud Lubbers, the prime minister of the 
Netherlands, said at a dinner in honor of his colleague Valdis 
Birkavs. The prime minister of the Latvian Republic arrived in 
Holland today on a three-day visit. 
  In his turn, V. Birkavs stressed that Latvia is going 
through 
a difficult, transitional period in its development now. It is 
made even more complicated by difficulties in its relations with 
Russia. Nevertheless, the head of the Latvian Government said, 
the people of the Latvian Republic believe in the prospects for 
democratic development in the country and hope for the support 
of other nations. Latvia has firmly declared its intent to 
gradually become a member of the European Union and to join 
international security structures. In this connection, the 
prime minister of Latvia asked the Netherlands for support. 
  Today, the sides signed two agreements -- on avoiding dual 
taxation and on protecting investments. V. Birkavs expressed 
the hope that even more important bilateral economic agreements 
would be drawn up soon.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 14, BNS -- Around 52.2 percent of Latvian 
families find it difficult to make both ends meet at the end of 
month, according to a public opinion poll, conducted by the 
State Statistics Committee. 
  The poll showed that 13.9 percent of families live on 
earlier 
savings, 14.9 percent have enough money but 0.7 percent are 
amply provided. 
  In total, 81 percent of families face serious money 
hardships. 
  Sixty-eight percent of respondents reported unable to save 
in 
the present conditions. Almost two-thirds of the interviewed 
said they could not make valuable purchases and would not be 
able to do it in the next twelve months, either. 
  The economic standing of families became worse between 1992 
and 1993, say the majority of respondents. Only 0.6 percent of 
families said they enjoyed an improvement in their material 
situation last year. 
  In addition, the families criticize the changes in the 
Latvian economic situation in 1993. Sixty-one percent of 
families say the economic situation became worse during the past 
year while 7.5 percent say the economic situation improved. 
  The poll interviewed 1,298 families. From those, 56 percent 
were urban dwellers and 46 percent lived in the countryside. 
The poll was aimed at studying the public opinion on the latest 
material welfare and economic situation changes in families.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 14, BNS -- The Lithuanian Foreign 
Ministry confirmed reports that Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys 
intends to go to Warsaw Friday [18 March] to initial the 
Lithuanian-Polish agreement on friendship and cooperation. 
  The treaty will presumably be signed by the presidents of 
Lithuania and Poland already this spring. The accord will come 
into effect after it is ratified by the Lithuanian parliament 
and when the sides exchange ratification documents. 
  Lithuanian and Polish experts last week completed editing 
the 
text of the treaty. 
  At a press conference in Vilnius Monday, Gylys said the text 
of the treaty will be publicly announced in accordance with "the 
established order." 
  The minister admitted that Lithuania and Poland failed to 
fully coordinate their positions on the 1920 occupation of 
Vilnius and its region by Poland. But Gylys said an emphasis 
should be laid on the future, not on the past. "The past is too 
heavy a burden." 
  "Many wounds, as well as reasons to start polemics or even 
conflicts, remained in the postwar Europe, but European states 
rose above all this and chose integration," the minister said. 
In his words, "if we will base relations with neighbors on 
wrongs, we will become a zone of tension." 
  Minister Gylys emphasized the need to have "a strong 
political basis" for solutions to practical problems. In his 
opinion, the treaty will become such a basis. 
  Commenting on criticism that the accord does not include 
sufficient security guarantees for Lithuania, Gylys said the 
treaty clearly says that neither of the states have any 
territorial claims and consider present borders inviolable. 
  The treaty was sharply criticized by MP Romualdas Ozolas, 
head of the parliament's commission for regional affairs. The 
lawmaker also made some sharp remarks about the Polish 
ambassador to Lithuania. 
  Minister Gylys said such statements "practically insult 
nations and diplomats accredited in our country." The minister 
said he was surprised that Ozolas, who is the chairman of the 
Lithuanian Center Union, expresses such "eccentric" views.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 14, BNS -- The Lithuanian Government 
approved two furthermost points of land in the sea which are 
necessary to determine the border of the country's territorial 
waters. 
  According to a March 10 government resolution, the northern 
"side-point" is on the territory of the Palanga resort, while 
the southern point is located on the Kursiu peninsula on the 
border with the Kaliningrad region. 
  According to the Lithuanian law, the country's territorial 
waters extend 12 nautical miles off the coast. According to the 
international conventions that Lithuania signed, the sea border 
must run more or less parallel to the coastline without any 
major deviations. 
  Zenonas Kumetaitis, director of the Lithuanian Geodesy 
Service, said the absence of a clear territorial sea border was 
a major hindrance in talks with Latvia and Russia on sea border. 
In his words, Lithuania will now be able to determine 
"side-borders" with its neighbors.

<F P=106> [Interview with President's Office chief Andrius Meskauskas </F>
by Raimonda Rameliene in Vilnius; date not given: "A Year in 
the Life of the President's Office: The Work With the President 
Was Free of Reservations and Doubts"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] 
  [Rameliene]Can one say that the president has a good, 
powerful, and competent team? 
  [Meskauskas] The absolute majority of those who work here 
have come to work for the president without any reservations and 
doubts. Certainly, not all of them understood immediately how 
they should work. The president is very tactful, friendly, and 
sincere but he is also a demanding person and he does not like 
to repeat things twice. All of us try to perform our duties as 
honestly as possible. 
  [Rameliene]The president's staff lead quite a settled 
way of life. Only one "ordinary" adviser and the chief one 
[Rajeckas was appointed ambassador to Great Britain] left over 
the first year. By the way, was it impossible to realize before 
the first anniversary that the position of the chief adviser is 
unnecessary? 
  [Meskauskas] The question could be whether the function of 
the chief adviser was interpreted correctly. The president, as 
well as the majority of our staff, likes to deal with people 
directly -- with those who directly analyze some problem, work 
on some issue, and so on. Certainly, Mr. R. Rajeckas is a man 
with extraordinary skills. However, such were the 
circumstances. I do not know whether we will retain this 
position in the future or not. 
  [Rameliene]People say that another adviser will soon 
leave for a Lithuanian Embassy abroad. 
  [Meskauskas]I really do not know and cannot say 
anything about this. 
  [Rameliene] In your opinion, which of the links at the 
President's Office is the weakest? 
  [Meskauskas] I do not even know. Sometimes these links may 
lack coordination. We have three structures: Advisers with 
their own experts, the economic division, and the chancellery 
which engages in certain bureaucratic work. Therefore, 
sometimes we really have slight misunderstandings in our 
relations. We are trying to overcome them. [passage omitted] 
  [Rameliene]How would you define relations between the 
president and the Seimas [parliament]? Do you not think that 
there would be fewer problems if you did not live under the same 
roof? 
  [Meskauskas] To a certain degree, yes. The presidential 
institution would be clearly separated from the Seimas. 
  We have not had any more serious problems in our relations 
with the legislature. True, the president rejected a couple of 
draft laws and sent them back to the Seimas for repeated 
consideration. However, this is normal -- both the parliament 
and the president can make mistakes. 
  Eventually, one of the president's duties is to stabilize 
contradictions among different political forces. It is 
difficult to achieve this now: Both the community and the 
Seimas are very much divided. I think, however, that no one 
could reprimand the president for supporting only one force. 
  [Rameliene] Nevertheless, some members of the 
Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party faction say that it is as if 
people from the President's Office are trying to raise 
themselves above the Seimas.... 
  [Meskauskas] None of us really intends to do so. However, 
one of the most important principles for the existence of a 
normal state is a clear and strict division of powers. Thus, we 
are seeking its implementation. In other words, we want the 
Seimas, the government, and the president whose functions are 
quite clearly defined in the Constitution to each do their work 
and not to interfere with the others. 
  The president signs draft laws adopted by the Seimas. Thus, 
his advisers are primarily interested in the logic of these 
documents. As I have mentioned, it is this logic that they 
failed to find several times. 
  [Rameliene]Have you not had any conflicts with the 
majority faction because of that? 
  [Meskauskas] Not any serious ones. [passage omitted] 
  [Rameliene]You have known A. Brazauskas for many years. 
Do you think that he has changed after becoming president? 
  [Meskauskas] Probably not. I particularly appreciate that 
he has remained sincere. He praises us rather seldom, but we 
are not small children. If something is wrong, he tells about 
this immediately, without beating about the bush. He has always 
been exacting and industrious. 
  In general, his life over the past several years has not 
been 
easy. While in the opposition, he was spited on and berated by 
anyone who would take the trouble. All this left a certain 
impression on him as if suppressing his vitality. The president 
is indeed a very lively person by nature.

  In the words of the Russian diplomat, "the holiday of 
Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin, who is in Sochi, will in no way affect 
the political content and the level of the official visit by the 
Japanese foreign minister." 
  The program of the visit, Grigoriy Karasin added, shows that 
Russia attaches great significance to its relations with Japan. 
During his stay in Russia, the Japanese minister is expected to 
meet Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev.

  [Excerpts] Moscow, 14 Mar -- The dumping of liquid 
radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan by vessels of the 
Pacific Fleet will only be carried out with the permission of 
the Russian Government. The Russian Naval Forces press center 
said this today in response to a request by an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent for a comment on a report by the Japanese paper 
MAINICHI. 
  The paper reported today, citing Valeriy Danilyan, the chief 
of the Pacific Fleet Chemical Service, that Russia could resume 
the dumping of waste in the Sea of Japan in May this year unless 
foreign countries, including Japan, provided financial help with 
building facilities to use and store liquid radioactive waste. 
The Russian Naval Forces press center said that this was the 
personal view of one of the Pacific Fleet leaders. However, the 
government has so far not made a decision on the dumping of 
waste in the Sea of Japan. [passage omitted] 
  Only the use of special facilities for rendering the waste 
harmless can solve the problem. A Finance Ministry 
representative recently said at a session of a government 
commission that the issue of allocating money for these problems 
will be resolved very soon. 
  It should be noted that Russia has not received the help 
promised by Western countries for the construction of the 
facilities. And the tanker for the storage and transportation 
of radioactive waste offered by Japan turned out to be wholly 
unsuitable for use.

  [Text] Vladivostok March 15 TASS -- Russia's Maritime 
Territory and Japan are pooling efforts to combat their common 
trouble -- the pollution of the Sea of Japan with the 
radioactive waste. The territorial administration head, 
Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, said specialists of the neighbouring 
country will install two waste-processing facilities to treat 
water used in nuclear submarine reactor. 
  Equipment of this kind has long been used in Japan and has 
proved a reliable tool in reducing radioactivity in waste to 
required level. 
  The first technological line will be installed in the Zvezda 
factory which repairs nuclear submarines in the city Bolshoy 
Kamen. Another installation will be attached to the Pacific 
Fleet. Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who visited 
Vladivostok on Monday, promised assistance in handling the 
project.

<F P=106> [Report by Eleonora Bertolotto on remarks of Russian Foreign </F>
Minister Andrey Kozyrev to journalists in Genoa on 12 March: 
"Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev: Russians Re-enter Mideast 
Arena; PLO Ready To Negotiate?"] 
  [Text] From Tunis to Genoa, from Jerusalem to New York: 
The Mideast peace negotiations are giving signs of emerging 
from hibernation and, this time too, as in Bosnia, Russia seems 
to be acting as the catalyst. On Friday [11 March], at the end 
of a shuttle trip between PLO headquarters and Israel, Moscow's 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev "announced" the imminent 
resumption of the negotiations broken off after the Hebron 
massacre. In fact, Yasir `Arafat was rather reserved, and all 
attention is now shifting to UN headquarters, where the Security 
Council is due to vote Monday on a resolution on the massacre, 
the text of which is now almost completely ready. 
  In his joint press conference with the PLO leader Friday 
evening, Kozyrev treated this as a fait accompli, talking in 
terms of Yasir `Arafat's "great courage." The latter confined 
himself to reaffirming the "political" commitment to resume 
negotiations, which has in any case never been denied. 
Yesterday Palestinian sources specified that it is necessary to 
await the Security Council vote before negotiations can resume 
and that Russia and the United States, as "co-sponsors" of the 
peace conference must provide "practical" guarantees of the 
Palestinians' security. This is precisely what Israel does not 
want. In any case Washington clearly told `Arafat a few days 
ago that it would prevent the approval of the UN resolution 
unless the PLO pledges to resume the dialogue with Israel. 
Yesterday the U.S. Government received Kozyrev's "announcement" 
with great circumspection. 
  Be that as it may, Moscow's foreign minister seemed 
determined to exploit the Middle Eastern arena, too, in order to 
bring Russian foreign policy to international attention again, 
and `Arafat for the present seems willing to provide him with 
the opportunity to do so. This obviously pleased Kozyrev, who 
was in Genoa yesterday on an unscheduled stopover necessitated 
by fog over Rome airport: "It is the critical nature of the 
present situation that demands that all forces mobilize for 
peace," he told journalists, recalling that he had spoken two 
days ago with the U.S. State Department's second-in-command, 
Strobe Talbott: "We are agreed in our impression: Either we 
succeed in salvaging the peace process in the Middle East right 
away, or we are bound to lapse back into conflict. Our efforts 
are shared by the United States. When the house is in flames, 
everyone must help to quench the blaze." 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] But some people have the impression that the 
United States really is not pleased with this latest Russian 
diplomatic initiative. 
  [Kozyrev] We spoke the evening before my departure, and I 
explained my intentions. I was assured that there are no 
objections to the plan. In any case, we are in constant 
contact. After the Hebron tragedy, the main problem is for 
everyone to do their utmost to safeguard peace. This task 
involves Russia and the United States, but also the Security 
Council, within which we have gone to very great pains to 
establish a text acceptable to both Israel and the PLO. 
[Kozyrev ends] 
  After a brief stroll through the city accompanied by Russian 
Consul Valeriy Karassev (he wanted to visit Columbus' house), he 
had a conversation with journalists at the airport in which he 
gave an account of his meetings in Tunis and Jerusalem: "Rabin 
and Peres in Israel and `Arafat in Tunis agreed on restarting 
the peace process and negotiations. It was more difficult for 
`Arafat, of course, who is demanding guarantees for the 
Palestinian population in the occupied territories. Partly for 
this reason, I believe that the resumption of the dialogue is a 
wise move on his part, and also a very courageous one." 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Is this a success for Russia? 
  [Kozyrev] Let us call it a joint achievement by Russia and 
the United States. At my meeting Monday with U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher in Vladivostok, we will talk about how 
our two countries can make themselves useful at this stage. We 
are willing to provide all the technical assistance necessary to 
organize the negotiations. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] But when can the negotiations resume? 
  [Kozyrev] It is up to the Palestinians and Israelis to 
decide 
where, when, and how to meet. We will accept whatever decision 
they may make. It does not matter whether they meet in 
Washington or in Cairo: The only thing that counts is that an 
opening be created. And that the two sides agree on the need to 
settle the issue of Gaza and Jericho right away. And to proceed 
from there to extend their agreement. [Kozyrev ends] 
  The only uncertainty hanging over the peace process, Kozyrev 
said, is precisely the Security Council resolution on the Hebron 
massacre; its section covering measures to protect the 
Palestinians living in the territories occupied by Israel, which 
the PLO regards as a precondition. "But it is not only the PLO 
now," the Russian foreign minister said. "Israel, too, has 
clearly stated that the opening is conditional on the adoption 
of the UN resolution." 
  However, the text of the resolution, presented yesterday 
evening by Russia, Spain, France, and Britain, is very vague 
about how security should be guaranteed. It calls for 
unspecified "measures" to ensure the protection of Palestinian 
civilians throughout the occupied territories, including "a 
temporary international or foreign presence." This is exactly 
what the Palestinians are demanding and the Israelis refusing. 
The wording of the UN resolution is vague, however, and cites 
the "Declaration of Principles" signed by `Arafat and Rabin in 
Washington on 13 September, which refers only to Gaza and 
Jericho and which in any case requires agreement between the two 
sides. The United States has objections on this point and on 
the section of the introduction that explicitly cites Jerusalem 
as being among the territories occupied by Israel. According to 
the Israeli Government, however, the city is the country's sole 
and indivisible capital, and there must be no discussion of its 
future for the present.

  [Text] Russia and the United States continue to be partners 
in spite of all the trials and tribulations that bilateral 
relations have been subjected to of late. This was stated in 
Vladivostok today by Foreign Minister Kozyrev after his talks 
with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. The problem of 
a settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the situation in the Near 
East were also discussed during the meeting. 
  Russia is no longer insisting on the immediate holding of a 
second international conference on the Near East, Andrey Kozyrev 
disclosed. He said that the most important thing now was to 
complete work on the implementation of the agreement on Gaza and 
Jericho.

<F P=106> ["Topic of the Week" by commentator Aleksandr Golts: "Chill </F>
Must Not Develop Into Confrontation"] 
  [Text] What is happening in U.S.-Russian relations now 
brings to mind a well-known anecdote: The pessimist says: "For 
some reason everything's gone wrong." Optimist: "That's 
nothing, it's going to get even worse." Conflicts and 
microcrises, beginning with the Ames affair and ending with 
former U.S. President Nixon's somewhat scandalous visit to 
Russia, have been following one another virtually 
uninterruptedly and in ever-increasing intensity. Furthermore, 
they are clearly assuming the character of a tendency toward a 
serious cooling off between Moscow and Washington. 
  For example, hardly had mutual understanding on the Yugoslav 
settlement been achieved than the United States was "gloating" 
over the negative reaction to Russia's idea of holding a 
conference on the Near East settlement. This week another 
alarming feature emerged -- namely, the intensification of the 
American factor in CIS affairs. It is certainly not the actual 
fact of a U.S. desire to play a more active role in the 
post-Soviet area that is causing alarm but the fact that this is 
happening, to put it mildly, without even a hint of cooperation 
between Moscow and Washington. 
  I have in mind the recent visits to the United States by the 
leaders of Ukraine and Georgia. On the one hand, one can only 
welcome contacts in which economic cooperation and the ensuring 
of peace and stability are discussed. But at the same time you 
cannot fail to see that the sides are most actively playing the 
"Russia card." Without the participation of Russia itself. 
  What, for example, was the point of Leonid Kravchuk's 
statement that "cooperation with the West will provide an 
opportunity to avoid the dire process now developing in Russia" 
where, according to him, "there is a perceptible tendency toward 
the creation of difficulties of an extremist and expansionist 
character." To translate that from the language of diplomatic 
innuendo to normal everyday speech, it can only mean one thing: 
Ukraine is offering itself to the West as a partner in 
preventing "Russian expansionism." You can understand Kravchuk: 
He is offering the little that he has to offer. But it is 
alarming that the United States did not consider it necessary to 
explain its own position clearly. 
  All this was expressed even more candidly during 
Shevardnadze's visit. As an experienced politician with an 
excellent grasp of the way things really are, he immediately 
presented the United States with a choice: either a UN 
peacemaking operation, or the performance of peacemaking 
functions by Russian troops. The Americans were quick to 
confirm that they will give every support to option one in the 
Security Council. Admittedly, Clinton immediately ruled out the 
very possibility of the direct involvement of U.S. troops. 
This, by all accounts, is not the only condition. A 
high-ranking administration representative cited by the 
WASHINGTON POST stressed in particular that the administration 
wants to restrict Russia's participation a much as possible in 
the peacemaking operation for fear of the rebirth of Moscow's 
imperial ambitions. 
  If all this is really so, such an approach not only goes 
beyond the bounds of normal mutual relations between states 
which just yesterday were virtually calling themselves allies, 
but also goes beyond the bounds of common sense. It turns out 
that for Washington it is more important to prevent the revival 
of the "empire" that it dreads so much. Even if that is to the 
detriment of a settlement of the conflicts on the territory of 
the former USSR. Incidentally, the U.S. secretary of state's 
recent statement confirms that this is indeed close to the 
facts. Christopher stressed that the United States does not 
recognize Russia's right to undertake any actions in the newly 
independent states without coordination with the United Nations 
and other international organizations. One can hardly object to 
the need to coordinate particular actions. Russia tried to do 
that by seeking a UN mandate to conduct peacemaking operations. 
But such coordination must happen exclusively through the will 
of the states directly involved in the resolution of conflict 
situations. On a voluntary basis, and certainly not to the 
order of the United States. Does Washington allow its own 
freedom of action to be restricted anywhere at all by 
consultations with international organizations? This is 
Orwellian: Everyone is free but some are freer than others. 
  It is not hard to find grounds for a cooling off between 
America and Russia (you can find quite a few grounds in the 
relations between two major states if you are prepared to look); 
the hardest thing to find is the real reason for it. In my 
view, the real reason is that Russia is beginning, albeit 
agonizingly and not without an inner struggle and inevitable 
vacillations, to reconsider its place and role in the world. 
That is prompted by the development of the internal political 
situation and an understanding of the West's real potential for 
supporting the reforms and settling conflict situations in the 
former USSR. It has become clear (regrettably quite late in the 
day) that this potential is not very great at all. 
  It has also become absolutely clear that people have to 
resolve their problems -- economic, military-political, and 
geostrategic -- themselves. But a country must feel that it is 
capable of doing that. Yes, Russia's new, active role in 
unblocking conflict situations in the countries of the former 
USSR and beyond, be it participation in the Yugoslav settlement 
or the Near East settlement, is important primarily because 
Moscow is offering sensible ways to end the sufferings of many 
thousands of people. But it must be said bluntly that this is 
also fundamentally important for Russia's self-consciousness now 
-- once again it feels that it is a state capable of raising 
and, importantly, resolving global tasks. And, when it comes to 
strengthening this consciousness, hopes are pinned on the 
successful solution of our internal difficulties. 
  But across the ocean it seems that they were not prepared 
for 
such a development of events. Over there they are too 
accustomed to regard themselves as the sole world center of 
power. And Russia's new view of itself and its role has 
provoked an irritated and not unduly rational reaction, in my 
view. The essence of the U.S. position and of the new U.S. 
prejudices was expressed quite recently by international affairs 
expert Dimitri Simes. The United States, he stated, is a great 
global power; Russia is a regional power. And a conflict will 
always occur whenever Moscow lays claim to globalism. If the 
United States is proposing to take just such an approach, this 
will obviously lead to deadlock. 
  Meanwhile the contradictions that exist are not insoluble. 
To eliminate them people only need to renounce the stereotyped 
images of Russia as a second-class country that have developed 
so quickly. It is important for both Moscow and Washington now 
not to be distracted by hysteria or be led along by those for 
whom the Cold War was the most precious thing on earth. Such 
people exist in both countries. There can be no doubt that they 
are trying to take advantage of the present cooling off. The 
danger today is that the search for a new model of mutual 
relations can easily give way to an escalation of charge and 
countercharge. However, neither Russia nor the United States 
can permit themselves the luxury of a new confrontation. 
  I believe that concern for the future of Russo-U.S. 
relations 
is by no means the least reason for Monday's meeting between 
Andrey Kozyrev and Warren Christopher in Vladivostok. Both 
states have a good opportunity to prevent an undesirable 
development of events. We shall see if they are successful.

  [Text] Washington March 15 TASS -- U.S. Secretary of 
Commerce Ronald Brown has described an amendment to the 
bilateral agreement on the suspension of anti-dumping inquiry 
into the deliveries of uranium products from Russia to the U.S. 
as a considerable step in trade cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  "The document envisages a joint sale of American and Russian 
uranium products in the U.S., and at market prices, too," 
Russian Deputy Minister of Nuclear Power Nikolay Yegorov, who 
signed the amendment for the Russian Government, told ITAR-TASS. 
  "According to preliminary estimates, Russia's revenue from 
the sale of uranium on the U.S. market may run at 150 million 
U.S. dollars annually. Of great importance is also the consent 
of U.S. uranium producers, who earlier accused our country of a 
desire to sell uranium products at dumping prices, to cooperate 
with Russia," Yegorov said. 
  A press release circulated here by the Russian Embassy in 
the 
U.S. points out that the amendment, agreed upon by the 
governments of the two countries, reflects the mutually 
beneficial and innovatory approach to the solution of trade 
problems and is a new specific example of partners' relations 
being developed by Russia and the U.S.

  [Text] Moscow March 14 TASS -- Russia and Latvia have 
failed to come to an agreement on Russia's payment for using a 
radar station in Skrunda (Latvia). 
  A regular round of Russo-Latvian talks began here on Monday. 
  The two delegations reached an agreement on social welfare 
guarantees for the retired Russian military. According to the 
agreement, those of them who permanently resided in Latvia as of 
January 28, 1992, are "guaranteed the right to unhindered 
residence in Lithuania and use of their movable property and 
real estate". 
  The agenda for the current round of talks includes 
discussions of an agreement on Russian troop withdrawal from 
Latvia and an agreement on legal status, conditions, terms and 
order of work of the Russian radar station in Skrunda.

  [Begin Prikhodko recording] We are very hopeful. It appears 
to us that contacts between experts from the two delegations on 
the eve of the talks have helped to achieve further progress 
toward agreement on outstanding questions. We hope that 
agreement on the technical questions that experts have not yet 
resolved will be achieved during this round, thereby creating 
real prospects for the initialling of the entire range of 
agreements on military questions. [end recording] 
  Disagreements still remain on the use of the Russian radar 
station at Skrunda and the status of Russian military pensioners.

  He told Russian Deputy Premier Yuriy Yarov, who met him at 
the airport, that he hoped his one-day visit would serve to step 
up Polish-Russian cooperation. 
  A senior Polish Foreign Ministry source who asked not to be 
identified told Interfax Pawlak's trip was unexpected to many in 
Poland. Even President Lech Walesa told the Polish news agency 
PAP on Monday that he had known nothing about Pawlak's plans to 
go to Russia, the source said. 
  He said the main purpose of the visit was to end the 
present-day stagnation in Polish-Russian trade and economic 
relations, primarily caused by the red tape of officials in both 
countries. The premier hopes to solve some key problems that 
have not been tackled for two or three years, namely, he wishes 
to reach agreement with Russia on the mutual cancellation of 
debts and terms for trade and economic cooperation. Warsaw will 
be satisfied with the visit if, during it, deadlines are set for 
the solution of five or six major economic problems and specific 
officials are put in charge of the work, the source said. 
  He said Poland did not attach prime importance to a package 
of accords ready to be signed in Moscow, which includes 
agreements on antimonopoly measures and on regulations on the 
employment of Russian citizens in Poland and Polish citizens in 
Russia. 
  On Tuesday, Pawlak will meet Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and will be having talks at the Finance and 
Agriculture Ministries and the Committee on Industrial Policy. 
He will return to Poland the same day.

  [Text] Moscow, March 15 -- Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
said starting his visit to Moscow on Monday that it was high 
time that Poland and Russia gave up mutual declarations and 
stopped talking about assistance but proceeded to concrete steps 
beneficial to both countries. 
  Pawlak said he would like to translate the language of 
treaties and accords into practical actions. He said he meant 
primarily long-term agreements on strategic raw materials and 
steps to build a gas pipeline from Russia to Western Europe, a 
railway line and a highway linking Berlin, Warsaw and Moscow.

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Popov article: "Phantoms Swooping in the Fog"] </F>
  [Text] The name of the Bosnian town of Maglaj has been 
making the headlines in the world press in recent days. In 
Serbian the word "magla" means gloom or fog. Magla -- fog -- 
features in many extremely colorful popular phrases relating 
most directly, unfortunately, to the present stage of the 
protracted Bosnian conflict. People who have lost their 
composure are described by the Serbs as having "fog descending 
over their eyes." Fleeing cowards are described as having fled 
into the fog, and people who behave unthinkingly and 
thoughtlessly and take a leap into the unknown, as "plunging 
into the fog." 
  As BBC radio reported, "twice in the last eight days UN 
forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina have been ready to launch air 
strikes against Serb positions." 
  World opinion is being purposefully and methodically 
prepared 
for another escalation of the Bosnian military conflict. This 
is being done, to use the Serb expression, under cover of a 
"diplomatic fog" -- talk about peace-making and about how 
allegedly it has finally proved possible to achieve a 
breakthrough at the peace talk among the conflicting parties. 
  Yet there are only separate Muslim-Croat talks, which it 
would be more correct to describe as a conspiracy aimed against 
the Serbs. After Washington, where U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher managed to bring the Muslims and Croats together by 
promising U.S. dollars to cement their still extremely 
problematic alliance, more detailed consultations shifted to 
Vienna. According to recent reports, an agreement has been 
reached on dividing Bosnian lands into Swiss-type cantons. 
  The Serbs have nothing against a Muslim-Croat federation, 
which could eventually become a confederation with Croatia, 
provided only that it is not the intention to form the new 
cantons at the expense of Serbian lands. But Muslim leader Alia 
Izetbegovic is already making absolutely overt demands of the 
Serbs for territorial concessions in favor of the nascent 
federation! 
  At the same time the cynical U.S. and NATO blackmail of the 
Serbs is growing all the time. It is in this context that we 
should view both the recent act of piracy by the Phantom 
aircraft which downed four Chaykas in the skies over Banja-Luka 
and the recent combat air patrols by NATO bandits [stervyatnik] 
over Maglaj. 
  As world news agencies have reported, British Lieutenant 
General Rose, commander of UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
asked Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's representative 
in the former Yugoslavia, for authorization to launch air 
strikes against Serb positions and was given it. After which 
Phantoms made combat flights into the Maglaj area, although they 
were unable to carry out the mission because of bad weather. 
  Maybe the most monstrous thing in this episode is Russian 
diplomacy's latest act of treachery toward the Serbs. Kozyrev's 
department is behaving as if nothing extraordinary has happened, 
and in recent days presidential envoy Vitaliy Churkin has even 
made statements which essentially constitute pressure on the 
Bosnian Serbs. 
  The fog surrounding "Yeltsin's Balkan initiative" is 
gradually dispersing, and on the eve of Kozyrev's meeting with 
Christopher in Vladivostok the British newspaper THE TIMES made 
a prediction which, unfortunately, looks extremely plausible: 
"It looks like the Americans have concluded a new Yalta 
carve-up with Moscow." In which case, the newspaper concludes, 
"one can only sympathize with the Serbs." It would be more 
correct, however, to say that sympathy should be extended not 
only to the betrayed Serb people but also to us Russians, since 
the Phantoms currently swooping over Maglaj are in fact also 
ready to open fire on Russia's interests!

he had been recruited much later, but refused to give the exact

<F P=106> [Andrey Streletskiy report under the "Special Services" </F>
rubric: "Surprise Move by Russian Counterintelligence Service 
Forces German Intelligence Service Chief To Leave Moscow Ahead 
of Schedule"] 
  [Text] As has already been reported, on Thursday, 10 
March, officers of the Russian Federal Counterintelligence 
Service [FCS] detained a Russian citizen suspected of 
cooperating with the FRG Federal Intelligence Service (BND). 
Aleksandr Mikhaylov, chief of the FCS Public Relations Center, 
would not give any details, pointing out that doing so before an 
indictment is handed down would be premature. Ironically, soon 
before it caught the BND agent, the Russian counterintelligence 
service had exposed a spy who worked for the British MI6 
service; at the time it immediately revealed some details about 
him -- for instance, that he was an employee of a Russian 
military-industrial company. This fact has suggested that the 
German spy caught in the FCS net is more important than the 
British one. 
  This theory was also confirmed by report, which was made 
public a bit later, about a telephone conversation between Horst 
Schmidtbauer, state minister at the FRG federal chancellor's 
office, and Anatoliy Safonov, FCS deputy director, to discuss 
matters concerning the arrest of the German intelligence 
service's agent. According to INTERFAX, the FCS representative 
said that the arrest of the German agent does not have any 
political bottom-line. 
  But why has the German side raised the question about the 
possible political bottom-line of a basically run-of-the-mill 
spy drama? Information received by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA from 
competent sources suggests that it was forced to do so. 
  It turned out that the press reported about the BND agent's 
arrest at a time when BND President Konrad Porzner was in 
Moscow. Mr. Porzner was invited to the Russian capital by FCS 
chiefs to discuss matters regarding the cooperation between the 
two countries' special services in areas where their interests 
coincide: the struggle against organized crime, international 
terrorism, activity in crisis areas. 
  As soon as the news about the exposed German spy was made 
public, Mr. Porzner was forced to suspend the talks and 
immediately leave for home -- to clarify the situation. To all 
appearances, it is this embarrassing situation that has forced 
the Germans to make "additional references." 
  The incident was not discussed by the chiefs of the FCS and 
the BND. Officials at the Russian special service hope, 
however, that the emergency will not thwart the already 
established and fairly fruitful cooperation of the two special 
services, a cooperation that nonetheless does not rule out 
classical intelligence activity against each other. 
  The arrest of a BND agent against the backdrop of the German 
special service chief's visit to Moscow may have occurred by 
chance. On the other hand, the FCS presumably had information 
about the spy long enough to expose him some time earlier. In 
this event, the goings-on have reminded us once again that 
intelligence and counterintelligence services have always 
maintained a special relationship that could scarcely be called 
a friendly one.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Katin report from Brussels: "Russia's Partnership </F>
With NATO Is a Misalliance. Kremlin Has Lost Its Nerve Too 
Soon"] 
  [Text] As of today, virtually everyone for whom NATO's 
"Partnership for Peace" program is meant has joined it. Except, 
so far, for Russia. I was told at the NATO head office that in 
principle that matter has already been resolved and that work is 
currently under way to draw up a corresponding document. If 
this is really so, Russia appears to be the first to have lost 
its nerve. 
  It so happened that all Russia's former Warsaw Pact allies 
and some former Soviet Union republics marched to NATO barracks 
having joined the "Partnership for Peace" program. U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, NATO General Secretary Woerner, and 
others have been telling President Yeltsin courteously: The 
door is open for you, too, all you need is to enter. An 
alternative is isolation. The top Russian authorities have long 
hesitated. A situation has come about where either Russia 
accepts the "Partnership for Peace" program for fear of 
isolation in Europe, or NATO countries will change their tone 
and suggest that Russia itself define its place in the 
collective defense system. The first option prevailed. 
  Everything could have turned out differently, however, were 
it not for someone's nerves. The thing is that in the NATO head 
office and in the capitals of the alliance's key members they 
had been bracing themselves for a turn or, maybe, an overture 
toward Moscow. For instance, Robert Hunter, U.S. ambassador to 
NATO, speaking at a special colloquium organized by the European 
Strategic Studies Center in Brussels on 25 February 1993 [as 
published], said bluntly: Relations between Russia and NATO 
should be a matter of special talks, which, to all appearances, 
may end up giving Russia a special status. 
  Guillaume Parmantier, an authority strategic affairs, 
professor at the Political Studies Institute, and deputy 
director of the NATO information department, the other day made 
a detailed analysis of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
pointing out Russia's extraordinary role in its settlement. "We 
should not forget," Parmantier writes, "that Russia is a great 
power. Any attempt to keep it away from the efforts to ensure 
European security would be a great mistake... Giving this power 
any security guarantees would make no sense, and inviting it to 
join NATO would be absurd." 
  These and other facts and evidence suggest that sentiments 
were gaining ground in NATO to offer Moscow something other than 
the "Partnership for Peace." They reasoned validly in NATO that 
it would not behoove Russia to join NATO on the same, albeit 
gentleman's, principles as Estonia and Albania. 
  It is quite possible, however, that the principles will 
indeed differ from those on which the East Europeans and the 
Baltic states have joined it. But what is important is the end 
result -- what will happen after the probationary period expires 
for countries that have signed the "Partnership for Peace" 
program? Everything will proceed in a clear-cut military 
fashion: these countries will perfectly naturally become 
full-blown members of the North Atlantic Alliance. This is 
actually why the transition program was invented. It is then 
that Russia will face a new dilemma. If it stays in the 
capacity of a "Partnership for Peace" member, this means that 
Russia will find itself in isolation once again and will be 
subjected to discrimination by comparison with other East 
European countries that will have become full NATO members. If 
it follows their suit and agrees to full membership, then it 
will have to place its armed forces, military plans, and budget 
under the control and command of ...the United States. For 
under a long-standing tradition, the NATO commander in chief has 
always been and remains an American general.

<F P=106> [Interview with DPRK Ambassador to Russia Son Song-Pil by </F>
Sergey Turchenko: "DPRK Getting In Someone's Way"] 
  [Text] As we have already reported, the United States has 
been bringing heavy pressure to bear on the DPRK of late and 
there have even been threats to use military force. This time 
the "world gendarme" has opted for "concern" over the alleged 
nuclear threat from North Korea as the reason for attacking an 
independent socialist state. The DPRK has taken a firm and 
resolute stance. 
  Recently there was a meeting between DPRK and U.S. 
delegations at which this question was discussed. What was its 
outcome? We put this question to North Korean Ambassador to 
Russia Comrade Son Song-pil. 
  [Son] We were able to elaborate an accord on four points: 
the cessation of the "Team Spirit-94" military exercises near 
the Korean border; the start of International Atomic Energy 
Authority inspections at our facilities; the resumption of the 
meeting of representatives from North and South on questions of 
exchanging special envoys; and the holding of a third round of 
Korean-American talks in Geneva, starting on 21 March 1994. 
  By and large we are satisfied with these decisions. But 
there was a strongly negative reaction to them on the part of 
Japan and South Korea. They are attempting to wreck the 
negotiating process. 
  [Turchenko] What are the reasons for this approach? 
  [Son] Japan already has stocks of 26 tonnes of plutonium. 
By 2010 they are forecast to reach 100 tonnes. This is enough 
to make 10,000 nuclear bombs. In February Japan launched a 
large long-range missile, the "H-2," which could be used to 
deliver a nuclear weapon. A similar situation exists in South 
Korea. It started developing nuclear weapons back in the 
seventies, and it has now entered a very significant stage. 
Both these countries need to be constantly grumbling about the 
imaginary nuclear problem in the DPRK in order to be able to 
continue their own developments. 
  [Turchenko] In connection with the Korean-American talks 
there was a report on Russian television to the effect that the 
DPRK had allegedly somewhat relaxed its resolve to steadfastly 
follow the path of building socialism, and a statement by the 
supreme leadership on a switch to Chinese-style reforms was 
supposedly expected in the very near future. What comment can 
you make on this? 
  [Son] It is sheer disinformation. We have established and 
will develop our own style of socialist system.

<F P=106> [Report by Pavel Vasilyev under the "Leaders' Opinion" </F>
rubric: "Eduard Shevardnadze: We Are Inviting the UN Blue 
Helmets Into Georgia"] 
  [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze's recently ended visit to the 
United States envisaged at least two goals -- obtaining credit 
to keep the sinking Georgian economy afloat and securing 
Washington's active assistance in the settlement of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, by, among other things, sending a 
U.S. contingent to that region. And whereas the first task was 
soon resolved -- Bill Clinton responded with $100 million and 
the Congress agreed to consider increasing that sum -- the 
second task proved a far harder nut to crack. After announcing 
full political support for the peacemaking efforts the White 
House boss nevertheless categorically avoided promising to send 
his soldiers to the Transcaucasus. Not even under the blue flag 
of the United Nations. 
  Nevertheless, the U.S. President did give his word to head 
an 
international movement to send the UN blue helmets to the border 
with Abkhazia. This measure will be particularly beneficial 
given that the latest round of Georgian-Abkhazian talks held in 
the past few days at UN headquarters in New York ended 
fruitlessly. 
  But the idea of international involvement in the search for 
ways out of the crisis, by all accounts, has not been abandoned 
by the Georgian leader. He took that idea to New York, where he 
met with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and set out his plan 
at a session of the Security Council. There are three 
"buttresses" to this plan: the creation of a directorate 
involving the opposing sides and representatives of the High 
Commissioner for Refugees, Russia, the "friends of Georgia" 
group, and other UN member states, the institution of a mixed 
administration in Abkhazia, and after that elections under 
international control and the formation of new organs of power 
based on those elections. "A specially created international 
organ is operating under UN auspices, with the assistance 
[sodeystviye] of the Russian Federation, and the participation 
of the CSCE," Eduard Shevardnadze said, "which will cooperate 
with the directorate and the government of the Republic of 
Georgia in elaborating and implementing a program for the 
economic revival of Abkhazia."

<F P=106> [Interview with Georgian head of state Eduard Shevardnadze </F>
by correspondent Nato Oniani; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Oniani] Good morning, friends. We are offering you 
a radio interview with Eduard Shevardnadze, the chairman of the 
Georgian State Council and head of state. 
  Batono [Georgian polite form of address] Eduard, the first 
question, of course, refers to your visit to the United States. 
In your opinion, how fruitful was it for the Georgian 
delegation? I am asking you this because having returned to 
Tbilisi, we heard rumors that the delegation had received a bad 
reception, and the attitude toward Georgia [words indistinct] 
and so on. 
  [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. The issue 
pertaining to gossip and rumors, I think that what you mean as 
gossip and evil rumors really exist. I do not think it is 
reasonable to keep proving the contrary. Those who closely 
watch TV programs and listen to the information we provide our 
population with, they do not need proof of whether the reception 
was good or bad. Some say that Georgia was well received rather 
than Shevardnadze. Some, vice versa. I would maintain that 
malice should also have limits. Let us assume that the 
delegation received a bad reception. Who should be happy over 
this? Why should he be happy? 
  To speak seriously, this has been a moral and political 
success and I would say a victory. This is a success of a 
country that has invariably chosen a road of democratic 
development. In case Shevardnadze betrayed democracy, [words 
indistinct]. True fighters for real democracy, all true 
reformers within the space of the former Soviet Union can be 
considered real heroes and they are persecuted as [words 
indistinct]. 
  As for gossip and malicious rumors and the venom that 
certain 
newspapers spit out, they will eventually eat themselves up. I 
do not pay much attention to them. Therefore, I even pity them 
because of their wretchedness and maliciousness. [words 
indistinct] This is from the point of view of polemics. 
  Now, about the success. First of all, this is a result we 
gained from a dialogue with the U.S. Administration. We got 
support for the issue pertaining to deploying peace-keeping 
forces in Abkhazia. Support has been clearly expressed. 
Commitments have been voiced in financing this action. 
  Second, we have the full right to say that we have a legal 
basis for relations with this great country. I mean that a 
Washington declaration has been signed, an agreement on mutual 
[word indistinct] has been signed. Although we cannot feel the 
effect of this, all this is extremely important. These are 
documents, which open large channels for economic and other 
kinds of cooperation between Georgia and the United States. 
This is very essential. 
  Third, I view it as very important that in the course of our 
dialogue with the president and his associates, as well as in 
the Congress and the Senate, we managed to familiarize leaders 
and legislators of this great country with what Georgia is, what 
we have, what the Abkhazian problem is, who is right and who is 
wrong. This is of essential importance because this conflict has 
been viewed with different attitudes at various spheres and 
levels. The truth of the issue has been demonstrated. The next 
result, I can say that this has been expected. I regard my 
meetings with leaders of the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund as very important. This will not bring immediate 
results today but an agreement I brought, the promises that they 
agree to support us in case we retain stability and strengthen 
it further mean that in future, we will not have to wander from 
one country to another in search of kopecks or dollars. All 
this will happen on a different basis. The financing of our 
programs, the development of certain spheres and so on will be 
based on the norms other states have been using. This is also a 
significant result. 
  I regard as very important the result of my meeting with 
Ivan 
Rybkin, the head of the Russian State Duma, with whom I had an 
excellent conversation, and I am now even more sure that we will 
overcome all difficulties that still exist after signing all 
agreements. [words indistinct] I frankly welcomed the meeting. 
  The next result -- this may be the most important -- I mean 
the meeting of the UN Security Council, where I was given an 
opportunity to say what a state leader is supposed to say in 
connection with the Abkhazian conflict. Not just because this 
is a high podium and one uses this podium, but we want the world 
to know the truth, we want the Security Council to know the 
truth. I think that Georgia's position was so explicit and so 
easy to understand that it was a rather rare case when the 
meeting of the Security Council proceeded without confrontation 
and the position of the Georgian delegation received unanimous 
support and unanimous recognition, especially on issues of the 
country's integrity and unity, the immediate return of refugees 
and the necessary guarantees for the deployment of peace- 
keeping forces. As you were present there you must have noticed 
that all speeches were almost unanimous on these three basic 
issues and clearly supported Georgia, which has taken a 
democratic way of development. 
  Yet another thing: It seems like an issue of minor 
importance now, although it is not of minor importance that we 
received very serious material support, financial support. 
Incidentally, without request from me, President Clinton 
announced of his own accord that the United States of America 
was allotting $70 million [to Georgia]. This is humanitarian 
aid rather than credit. I have to say that without this aid we 
would not have other sources after the EC credit had been 
exhausted. 
  Thus, I do not know whether we could have thought of gaining 
more than we did during the three days materially, financially, 
politically and morally, including the issue that is of major 
concern to us at the moment, the issue of Abkhazia. 
  [Oniani] Speaking of Abkhazia, you have said, and it was 
emphasized in the United Nations too, that such unanimous 
support was almost unprecedented for the United Nations. No 
remarks were made regarding our side. It was really amazing 
that the Russian representative's speech was almost one of the 
most constructive ones. In addition to the UN Security 
Council's support, the U.S. President's support, and the support 
by the U.S. congressmen, we know that no financing of the 
peace-keeping operation is possible without Congress' opinion. 
You had a meeting in the Pentagon where an opinion was voiced 
that the Pentagon would help Georgia. The Secretary of Defense, 
Perry himself, said that a U.S. military attache would arrive 
[in Georgia], that they would assist us in the formation of a 
new army, and this is what we really need in Georgia. 
  What way do you think will remain if a political settlement 
of the Abkhazian issue over which you have spoken so long and 
toward which the Georgian policy has been moving cannot be 
arranged? Are we capable of resolving this problem in a 
different way if we are not left any other way out? 
  [Shevardnadze] I would answer the question in this way. We 
have received very strong support at the UN Security Council. 
Before that, when the Russian president was in Georgia, we 
talked, signed agreements, and made mutual commitments over the 
peaceful settlement of the Abkhazian conflict. Now that all 
this has happened in Washington and New York and a platform has 
been established for the peaceful settlement, notwithstanding 
what the resolution will say, we have to speak about using every 
path leading to that major road and act respectively. It can be 
said that we would not dream of a better opportunity. Now, 
everything will depend on the art of using this opportunity and 
our vigor. Much will depend on the complete implementation of 
the agreements. 
  Now, about the Pentagon's attitude. I do not think that the 
Pentagon is able to exert a strong influence on our military 
potential. We have not asked for this either. It is not 
practical to think of, say, getting armaments, getting warlike 
stores and so on from them. In this issue we will still depend 
on Russia, on the Russian Army. The commitments the Russian 
leadership has made -- at least verbally -- should be a 
guarantee that the process of the Georgian Army's formation will 
be accelerated. 
  As for the military way [to resolve the Abkhazian problem] 
you have asked me, I would give you an answer like this. We 
must always be ready to defend the territorial integrity of our 
country. No one should have any doubts of our readiness to do 
this. When I say that our army is in the process of formation, 
I do not mean that it lacks combat abilities today. So, all 
branches of our Armed Forces are ready to fight for Georgia's 
independence, freedom, and the preservation of its territorial 
integrity. 
  [Oniani] Batono Eduard, before leaving for the United 
States you spoke about the danger of a revival of the Cold War. 
There, in the United States, I think at the meeting with 
American politicians, the Americans asked a question about it. 
They were interested in this issue. They recalled your words. 
I wonder how your American visit strengthened or, on the 
contrary, eliminated this feeling in connection with recent 
events in Russia, a feeling that the danger of a return to the 
Cold War period could become a reality. 
  [Shevardnadze] As for the danger of a Cold War, of which you 
have just spoken, and there were quite a lot of questions 
referring to this issue there [in the U.S.], a danger of 
recurrence is real. Confrontation between the United States and 
Russia could become the major feeding source of the recurrence 
if this were allowed to happen. 
  I spoke about the inadmissibility of this sort of 
confrontation at every level in the United States. This was 
during a dialogue with the President and his associates. I 
spoke about it at the Congress, at the Senate, at meetings with 
political and other figures. The idea was indirectly expressed 
in my speech at the Security Council meeting and other speeches 
I made in the United States. 
  The next phenomenon that could push mankind toward Cold War 
is a rather widely spread aggressive separatism that grows into 
conflicts. You may remember that I spoke about it [words 
indistinct]. At that time I had the impression that this pained 
some people's ears. 
  Today, the world has realized that this aggressive 
separatism, that cost Georgia so much, may grow into a grave 
threat for the whole planet. Yugoslavia is a good example. 
This is an explosive triggering device, which is present in a 
number of countries. I am afraid that if this is not stopped 
and these current conflicts are not settled, the danger of cold 
and hot wars will become reality. 
  I am pleased that conversations in the United States touched 
upon this issue and Georgia's opinion, an opinion of its leader 
that evoked everyone's interest, not because we were inventors 
but because we have been in the middle of events of this kind 
and, therefore, we feel this in a more acute way than others, 
and see the scale of the threat. But the main thing is to rule 
out any serious confrontation between these two countries and 
this will be a guarantee for peace. 
  [Oniani] The situation in Georgia is rather critical today. 
[Word indistinct], transport is not working and so on and so on. 
You had very interesting meetings at the World Bank, with the 
Monetary Fund, OPEC, you have already mentioned. Regarding the 
significant and good plans drafted for Georgia, how deep and 
lasting do you think our economic crisis will be? 
  [Shevardnadze] I have to say in this connection that our 
economic crisis is additionally [words indistinct]. During 
talks with an expert from the World Bank and the executive 
secretary, it was emphasized that our country, with its 
situation in western Georgia, differs from many other countries 
in a critical situation by complexity and difficulties. But, at 
the same time, it was said that if we stuck to the course we had 
taken toward establishing and strengthening stability, 
establishing order in the country, and if we stirred up the 
potential we possessed, these immense international 
organizations would be ready to help Georgia. If this happens 
the length of the crisis will become shorter and chances will 
increase to escape from the crisis sooner. 
  The way out depends on how well we manage our own country. 
In the first instance order is essential and at the same time 
it is necessary to use all the potential we possess. We have to 
harvest tea, to harvest grapes, to harvest fruit, we have to 
plow soil, we have to run industry as it can be run. I think 
that in such conditions we will be able to come out of the 
crisis [word indistinct]. 
  [Oniani] It often happens that your foreign trips are 
echoed in Georgia. It may be an explosion, it may be a murder 
or something like that. The same happened this time. There 
were explosions in the buildings of the Rescue Corps and the 
Chamber of Control. How would you comment on these events? I 
would not want to say this, but the explosion in the Rescue 
Corps building has a flavor of terrorism, while the explosion in 
the Chamber of Control looks more like a political act. We 
remember that last year you said at parliament that documents 
connected with [words indistinct] activities would be sealed and 
the Chamber of Control would be starting work on the issue 
having collected certain materials. 
  [Shevardnadze] It seems to me the same way. When we speak 
about terrorist acts, some deputies speak at parliament and 
throw stones into the state's garden, I mean they blame the 
state. They speak of state terrorism. Did the state blow up 
the headquarters of the civil defense [the Rescue Corps is 
occupying this building]? Or can a man of reason think of 
causing an explosion in the Chamber of Control? 
  Ruling out any interference and influence, I would like to 
say the following: We are facing unruly banditry. These are 
acts of banditry, acts of subversion. I have to emphasize one 
thing. We have had a lot of good words to say to the Ministry 
of Security and the Interior Ministry. But now we have to say 
that neither the Ministry of Security nor the system of interior 
affairs fight against crime as they are expected to. 
  A system of raiding criminal groups is a very good job and 
it 
is very efficient. [sentence as heard] But now it is time for 
a decisive say from the Ministry of Security, and the whole 
system of the ministry has to demonstrate its professional 
skills in fighting terrorist acts. It is in the state's 
interest, the whole state structure's interest, to have all 
criminal cases revealed and have criminals punished. I will 
tell you openly that we have to make and we will make the law 
enforcement bodies reveal all terrorist cases. 
  Georgia's authority as a civilized, cultural, and normal 
country should be restored. This is the republic's cause. I 
can say that this is a national cause, a state cause, and we 
must do this. 
  [Oniani] The final question: A regular working week for 
parliament begins tomorrow. Have you introduced any alterations 
into your plan of parliamentary activities? 
  [Shevardnadze] The parliament will apparently be working 
according to planned subjects. There are certain ideas but I 
would say one thing; during my visit to the United States and 
especially when I had meetings with representatives of business 
and financial circles and so on, the main questions pertained to 
legislature. What laws have the Georgian parliament managed to 
pass that would help develop the economy. What fate will 
foreign investments have in Georgia. They are interested not in 
generalized laws but in details. In this respect our parliament 
is lagging behind. It is significantly lagging and it should be 
admitted that the chairman [Shevardnadze] and the speaker with 
his deputies cannot manage well. Many laws, over 60 laws are 
ready and we are not able to pass them. 
  I should also say that our parliament is not keen on passing 
laws. They would rather be active in the political sphere than 
economic. This is not a fault. We must be involved in every 
sphere. Today however, overcoming the crisis is a major task 
and many deputies demand that economic reforms be implemented as 
soon as possible. But no reforms will be implemented if 
legislative activity is not properly directed. In this respect, 
if there is any draft law, then parliament must work on it. 
Parliament must work on drafting laws and their soonest 
possible implementation. For instance, the law on land. There 
were a lot of debates on this law but we could not reach consent 
and then we abandoned the law. Now, I am asked to issue a 
decree on it. I cannot do this. Land is such a problem, such a 
painful and delicate problem [words indistinct]. 
  This sort of alteration, or rather turn in the activities of 
the parliament, especially in the economic sphere is a must. 
  [Oniani] Thank you for the interview. You have been 
listening to Eduard Shevardnadze.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Izark Vasilidze, including </F>
recorded remarks by Vakhtang Gogaudze, Georgian Supreme Council 
speaker and Zurab Erkvania, chairman of the Council of Ministers 
of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia] 
  [Text] Another provocation and an attempt to destabilize 
the situation in the republic -- that is the leitmotif of the 
view of the Abkhazian Parliament of yesterday's action by the 
Georgian Supreme Council, which I will remind you adopted a 
resolution dissolving the Abkhazian Parliament. Tbilisi also 
continues to discuss this topic. 
  [Vasilidze] The unanimity with which the resolution was 
adopted leads one to think that either a solution to the 
Abkhazian question already exists, and everything is ready for 
its implementation, or that it is one of those purely academic 
issues at the level of juridical law making. Having spoken to 
officials, the opinion remains that the whole affair is most 
probably within the realm of the second alternative. Inter alia 
Vakhtang Goguadze, the speaker of the [Georgian] Supreme 
Council, replied to the question of how the decision will be 
implemented, saying: 
  [Goguadze] It depends on the further development of the 
situation, the general circumstances; what things are like in 
Russia, Georgia, our mutual understanding and relations -- it 
depends more on this than directly on the decision adopted. 
  [Vasilidze] Regarding the question of the possible renewal 
of 
military actions in Abkhazia by the Georgian leadership, 
Vakhtang Goguadze replied: 
  [Goguadze] For our part, for the part of the leadership, 
this 
is in no way permissible. Therefore, Abkhazia should be 
demilitarized, and then we have to restore police order, and 
live according to the language of the Constitution. 
  [Vasilidze] Zurab Erkvania, the chairman of the council of 
ministers of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia, which by the 
Supreme Council's decision received the status of the 
temporarily evacuated and only legal body of authority in 
Abkhazia until elections are held, spoke about the situation in 
Abkhazia. 
  [Erkvania] The confederation, which is calling the tune on 
the temporarily occupied territory of Abkhazia is virtually, in 
essence, a terrorist, illegal organization that was formed on 
the territories of independent, sovereign states -- the Russian 
Federation and the Republic of Georgia. It is evident that this 
resolution gives a legal evaluation of their criminal activities. 
  [Vasilidze] At the same time, the Georgian Supreme Council's 
decision clearly arouses increased interest by Russia as well. 
There is no doubt that today's confidential meeting between 
Vladimir Zemskiy, the Russian ambassador to Georgia, and the 
Supreme Council's speaker, touched on this theme. 
  Izark Vasilidze from Tbilisi, specially for NTV. 
  [Announcer] Certain very confidential sources claim that 
Eduard Shevardnadze secretly met the Abkhazian leader Vladislav 
Ardzinba in New York, and it is not ruled out that this 
information made it to the Georgian Supreme Council, causing 
such a harsh reaction.

  [Text] The talks on settling the Georgian-Abkhazian 
conflict will not be continued until the Georgian parliament 
cancels its decision of dissolving the Abkhazian parliament, 
Chairman of the Abkhazian parliament Vladislav Ardzinba told 
Interfax after a press conference in Moscow on Tuesday. 
  He also said that the peace process was over and laid the 
entire blame for this on Georgia. 
  On March 10, the Georgian parliament charged Abkhazia's 
Council of Ministers with the task of performing the Abkhazian 
parliament's functions pending early parliamentary elections, 
and granted the Council of Ministers the status of a temporarily 
discharged body. 
  The Georgian parliament's resolution says that all legal 
acts 
passed by the Abkhazian separatists shall be considered invalid.

UN was an attempt to win back by diplomatic means what had been 
lost in Abkhazian war. By means of the UN peacemaking forces, 
and under the thesis of Georgia's territorial integrity, 
Shevardnadze attempts to provide this integrity de-facto". This 
was the comment given to SNARK correspondent in Moscow by Zurab 
Achba, the Chairman of Legislation Committee in Abkhazian 
Parliament, while he spoke on the Georgian head visit to the USA. 
  As Achba told, the Abkhazian leadership does not mind the 
presence of the UN peacekeeping forces in the conflict zone. 
"We only object those functions which they are intended to be 
given. Peace forces are entitled to prevent the military 
actions, and should be dislocated along the confrontation line, 
not on the entire territory of Abkhazia", declared Achba.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Georgian Parliamentary Opposition </F>
`Against' CIS Membership"] 
  [Text] The Georgian parliamentary opposition has given a 
hostile reception to the decision of the majority of the 
deputies on the republic's membership of the CIS. This decision 
has been perceived by the opposition as "support for Russia's 
imperial ambitions in the post-Soviet area." Deputies from the 
National Independence Party, the National Democratic Party, the 
People's Front, and a number of other parties (16 in all) are 
holding joint consultations and meetings to elaborate a policy 
of opposition to Georgia's inclusion in the CIS. 
  It has reached the stage where the opposition intends to 
appeal to the republic's Supreme Court because, in its opinion, 
parliament's decision on Georgia's membership of the CIS is 
unlawful. Its appeal is based on the fact that this decision 
was made by a simple majority of deputies and not two-thirds of 
them, even though the republic's legislation contains no clear 
ruling on that question.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 14, BNS -- Estonia is in every respect 
ready for the removal of nuclear fuel from Paldiski, Ago 
Tiimann, secretary of the Estonian delegation for talks with 
Russia and head of the military issues working group, told BNS. 
  Tiimann said the dismantling of the Paldiski reactors is the 
only military issue under discussion at the negotiations "on 
which (the delegations) have been working closely together." 
  "To date, everything has proceeded as planned and in 
accordance with agreements," Tiimann claimed. 
  Russia has more than once announced that it is prepared to 
start removal of nuclear fuel from Paldiski already in April and 
complete it by June. 
  Tiimann said all possible safety and security measures will 
be taken during the operation, which is the reason why the dates 
and the route will not be made public. 
  Russia plans to use for transporting the fuel new, TK-18 
type 
containers, which have never before been used for this purpose. 
The authorities are going to test the containers in March to 
find out if they meet safety standards.

<F P=106> [From the "Baltic Business Weekly" feature] </F>
  [Text] For already two months in a row Estonia has an 
unusual for that Baltic nation high monthly inflation of about 
5.5 percent, which is not likely to fall in the oncoming several 
months. 
  But Prime-Minister Mart Laar says the inflation is going to 
drop due to slower growth in the country's hard currency 
reserves. 
  The consumer price index in Estonia rose 5.2 percent in 
February, down just a bit from January's 5.5 percent, prompting 
experts to review the earlier predicted 15-25 percent annual 
inflation level for this year. 
  Goods became an average 4.6 percent more expensive last 
month, the report by the Statistics Department shows. The price 
rise for food was reported at 6.8 percent, and for manufactured 
goods, 0.9 percent. The prices of services rose 6.3 percent. The 
total price rise in the country was 43.1 percent when compared 
with the same month a year ago. 
  Fruit and vegetables topped the price rise list for separate 
groups of goods with 15 percent in February. Milk, dairy 
products and eggs followed with 11.9 percent, and fats, with 9.7 
percent. Also substantial was the rise of alcohol prices, 10.3 
percent, mainly due to a increased excise tax. Expenses for 
housing went up 5.1 percent in February, and for transport and 
communication, 5.0 percent. 
  Relatively high inflation rates in the first two months of 
the year have rendered it unlikely that Estonia would be able to 
make the year within the earlier predicted 15-25 percent 
inflation level. There is not much improvement in prospect this 
month, as price rises became effective on March 1 alone for 
telephone calls, ferry and railway tickets, water supply, 
sewage, and, in some places, for bread and milk. 
  Experts questioned by BNS now predict an annual inflation of 
around 30 percent for 1994. 
<H3>  Estonian Premier Mart Laar Predicts 1994 Inflation at 40 
Percent </H3>
  Laar emphasized that the high rate of inflation observed 
through the first two months of the year will not reduce in the 
first half of the year and will amount to a monthly 5-6 percent. 
  The Premier believes, however, that in the second half of 
1994, inflation will drop to 1.5-2 percent a month which would 
allow not to exceed the level of 40 percent through the entire 
1994. 
  According to Laar, one of the main reasons for the inflation 
spirals in early year is a fast growth in the country's currency 
reserves. "Estonia currently has such an amount of money which 
is simply hard to handle," Laar told BNS. 
  In the premier's words, an interim hike in inflation 
resulted 
from a too speedy development of Estonia's economy over the 
second half of 1993. "This is something new. The IMF experts 
have been also surprised and cannot provide an explanation," 
Laar said. According to the premier, "similar was experienced 
some time ago by the Czechs." 
  The premier also highlights that despite growing inflation, 
"there are no causes for alarm. We receive encouraging reports 
about a slowing pace in the growth of hard currency reserves. 
This means that inflation will start to drop in two-three 
months." Laar stressed in addition that Estonia has sufficient 
guarantees, such as a balance budget, eliminated subsidies and a 
solid money legislation, to survive from such financial shakes. 
  Meanwhile, the Bank of Estonia said the inflation in January 
was only 15.6 percent due to the increasing money supply. The 
bank's monthly economic overview says that high inflation of the 
last months "had no monetary basement". 
  More grounds for the Laar's optimism lie in the fact that 
another source triggering inflation will go down soon. "To a 
large extent, inflation is explained by our decision late last 
year to liquidate the remaining subsidies to households for 
transport, housing and energy. The major part of inflation 
attributes directly to the suspended subsidizing of prices for 
these services," stressed the premier.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 11, BNS -- The Estonian Government 
approved yesterday a bill on broadcasting and passed it to the 
parliament for consideration. 
  The bill establishes radio, television and teletext as forms 
of broadcasting. Under the bill, one Estonian-language 
television channel, one Estonian-language teletext channel, two 
Estonian-language radio channels and one Russian-language radio 
channel will be financed from the state budget. 
  The bill stipulates that tapes of radio and television 
programs must be preserved for a period of three months. 
  The bill establishes the principle of political balance 
under 
which the national broadcasting channels must give all political 
parties the same amount of air time. 
  The bill bans tobacco advertising and advertisements that 
promote consumption of alcohol. It forbids the use of 
newscasters and political commentators in advertising. 
  The broadcasting bill was drafted by former Justice 
Minister, 
attorney Mart Rask and Rein Lang, one of the owners of AS Trio 
that operates the Tallinn-based Kuku radio station.

  [Text] The Estonian Government decided to cut down the 
transmission time of the Russian TV broadcasting company 
Ostankino on the territory of the republic from 9.5 to 4 hours a 
day starting on March 11, Government Press Secretary Ain Saarna 
told a briefing in Tallinn Friday [11 March]. He said the only 
Russian channel in Estonia will be broadcast every day from 
18:00 to 22:00. 
  Saarna explained the measure by saying that Russia owed 
about 
DM [German marks] 200,000 to Estonian Esttelecommunications for 
relaying the broadcasts. 
  The Estonian government asked Esttelecommunications to 
inform 
Ostankino of its decision and to conclude a new contract 
envisioning the reimbursement of its debt and regulating other 
procedural issues before March 28. Otherwise, Ostankino 
programs will no longer be broadcast on Estonian territory, 
Saarna said.

  [Editorial Report] Tallinn Radio Tallinn Network in 
Estonian at 1000 GMT on 15 March broadcasts a 5.-minute report 
on a meeting of pensioners in Tallinn today, near the parliament 
and government building on Toompea Square. The unidentified 
correspondent notes that Marju Lauristin, the minister of social 
affairs, was surrounded by pensioners eager to voice their 
grievances and she promised to convey their problems to the 
government, which is scheduled to meet this morning. 
  The correspondent then interviews Lauristin who says that 
the 
pensions issue is a priority for the government but extra money 
is hard to find. "What we have done now," she explains, "is to 
provide compensation totalling 200 million kroons for domestic 
bills and there is a law on increasing pensions being debated 
now -- another 200 millions are needed for that. To the 
population at large this will seem like a crumb to a beggar. 
And public discontent is particularly bolstered by the fact 
that incomes have become so different and these differences in 
wages and incomes can be as much as 20 or 30 times."

<F P=106> [Vasiliy Kononenko report: "B. Yeltsin Has Gone to Sochi </F>
Not for Treatment But To Rest and Work"] 
  [Text] The end of March promises to bring yet another 
burst of activity to Russia's political life. It is planned 
that a memorandum on accord and peace will have been prepared by 
that time. No easy task. This fact is probably linked to some 
extent with President B. Yeltsin's departure for Sochi. If the 
chronology of all the memorable events of the last few years is 
traced, a pattern inevitably emerges: Before making important, 
not to mention unexpected, decisions the president has 
disappeared for some time from journalists' field of vision and 
has withdrawn in order to get away from current affairs and work 
out his plans. 
  This supposition was indirectly confirmed by the president 
himself during a conversation with journalists at Vnukovo-2 
Airport. "For me, leave is a change of work regime," he said. 
When asked about the state of his health, he replied: "Fine, 
although I have suffered two bouts of influenza. I am going not 
for treatment, but to rest and work." 
  Later, replying to an IZVESTIYA correspondent's question as 
to whether the president foresees difficulties over the drafting 
of the memorandum on accord and peace, he stated: "An easy 
solution to this problem is not to be expected -- the spectrum 
of opinions among political forces is too broad. Nonetheless 
there is a chance for defining common approaches, which would 
become the basis for accord. It is possible that leaders of 
certain power structures, including the prime minister, will 
come to Sochi to work on this document," he stressed. The 
president also announced that during his leave he intends to 
spend time working out a mechanism for implementing the 
president's message to parliament. "This must be done in such a 
way that this mechanism's work is scheduled on a month-by-month 
basis." 
  Chernomyrdin arrived at Vnukovo-2 to see him off with a 
magnificent bouquet of flowers. It turned out that they were 
intended not for the president but his wife, whose birthday it 
is today.

<F P=106> ["IZVESTIYA Exclusive" Interview with Sergey Filatov, leader </F>
of the President's Administration, by ITAR-TASS Observer Tamara 
Zamyatina, date and place not given: "Sergey Filatov: The 
Opposition Imposed Its Rules of the Game on the President"] 
  [Text] After the Russian Prosecutor General's Office, 
acting in accordance with the State Duma decree, released the 
organizers of the bloodshed in Moscow, many fellow citizens 
asked the following question: Since the president called this 
decision unconstitutional, why did he not use his powers as 
guarantor of the Constitution and suspend the act of political 
amnesty? 
  Sergey Filatov, leader of the President's Administration, 
now 
gives his opinion on the reasons for the conduct of Boris 
Yeltsin, his aides Yuriy Baturin and Georgiy Satarov, the State 
Duma deputies, and the leaders of the Prosecutor General's 
Office. 
  A few days before the decision on the political amnesty was 
adopted, I attended the Duma Council session which discussed the 
draft of this document. No one supported the draft apart from 
Zhirinovskiy. Votes were cast against it by Shakhray, who 
predetermined the result of the 23 February vote, and by Lakhova 
and the representatives of the Communist Party of the Russian 
Federation faction. They asked the same questions that we are 
asking today: What kind of political amnesty is this, is it not 
a cover for criminals to hide behind, and how is the decree to 
be implemented without causing distortions to the law? On the 
basis of these questions which remained unresolved in the draft 
decree, the deputies voted against it. 
  However, a few days later they voted in favor of it. Yet the 
questions remained unanswered and the deputies were supposed to 
have adopted a document which would have addressed those 
questions. Who can explain this inconsistency? 
  However, there is surely some consistency here. After all, 
by no means the least role in the adoption of the amnesty 
decision was played by those same people who opposed the 
president in the former Supreme Soviet. The only difference is 
that Viktor Ilyukhin, leader of the Security Committee and a 
member of the communist faction, came to the aid of Vladimir 
Isakov, leader of the Legislation Committee. 
  There is a certain logic to the opposition's conduct. Its 
plan is this: Either the president does not intervene in its 
actions, in which case the opposition will achieve its goal, or 
the president does intervene, in which case he loses by setting 
himself against the legislative power. 
  You can try that trick once, you can try it twice. But you 
cannot be sure that every time you do it all the senior 
officials will withdraw and leave the president one on one with 
that misunderstanding of the laws, which is what the opposition 
is doing. You cannot always count on the fact that the 
president will have the final say. There is a certain 
threshold, there are rules which every responsible official must 
abide by. 
  But when you are expecting a normal constitutional process 
and they impose the complete opposite on you, this of course 
produces a certain shock. But it was agreed to refrain from 
such rules after the 12 December elections and work instead on 
the basis of constructive cooperation between the branches of 
power. But what has happened is that Baturin and Satarov, the 
president's aides, acted according to civilized rules and held 
talks with the State Duma, the Prosecutor General's Office, and 
the Supreme Court but the latter merely played games with them. 
After all, the word "immediately" in the State Duma decision on 
the amnesty has nothing to do with jurisprudence. But instead 
of waiting for clarifications from the lower house of parliament 
on the mechanism for the enactment of its decree, it was set in 
motion straight away. 
  I told Kazannik about this when I phoned him on the evening 
of Friday, 25 February. The first thing that he said to me was 
this: "At 0900 hours on 26 February I shall release them all 
from Lefortovo." I was worried that the decision was being 
implemented right away without clarification on the mechanism of 
its implementation. I put that question to Kazannik, and he 
replied: "If I do not release them, Kravtsev (deputy prosecutor 
general--T.Z. note) will." 
  My second question was this: Why not hand the State Duma's 
decision over to the Constitutional Court, after all, it will 
continue its work on the basis of the new law any day now. 
Kazannik replied that this law does not exist at the moment. My 
third suggestion was to pass the Duma's decree to the Supreme 
Court, a structure that is in operation. To all these questions 
I received a negative reply. 
  The final words which Kazannik said to me were these: "If I 
do not release them I will be charged under the article on 
exceeding my powers." 
  No matter what one says about the need to obey the letter of 
the law, I am sure that the haste and inconsistency with which 
the Prosecutor General's Office acted are absolutely obvious. 
  The judicial investigation which is now being conducted at 
the Russian Prosecutor General's Office on the instructions of 
its new leader, Aleksey Ilyushenko, will answer many of the 
questions about the circumstances of and reasons for the hasty 
implementation of the State Duma's decree on the political 
amnesty. 
  I am also bound to note a certain aloofness on the part of 
the deputies, prosecutors, and judges to the reason why the 
amnesty was carried out. We have already been through this once 
before when Khasbulatov imposed his ideas and believed that he 
was acting in the interests of all society. If the reason for 
the amnesty was to achieve social accord, there is only one side 
which cannot take part in that process. After all, those people 
who left Lefortovo jail take no account of the fact that this 
was done for their sake. 
  As a result, the last word has once again been left to the 
President, who to achieve real accord undertook the initiative 
to unite all the political forces in society for the elaboration 
of a charter on civil peace in the country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Samoylov, deputy chief of the </F>
Administration for Work With Territories of the Russian 
President's Administration, by Nikolay Dorofeyev; date and place 
not given: "Russia Continues To Choose" -- first paragraph is 
introduction] 
  [Text] In accordance with the Russian Federation 
president's edict "On Stage-By-Stage Constitutional Reform" 
elections were held 12 December to the country's new supreme 
legislative organ -- the Federal Assembly. Thereby began the 
process of forming a representative branch of power in Russia, 
and this process is now moving to the regions. TRUD's 
correspondent discusses what is happening now as regards 
elections in the federation components with Sergey Samoylov, 
deputy chief of the Administration for Work With Territories of 
the Russian Federation President's Administration. 
  [Dorofeyev] Let us begin our conversation, Sergey 
Nikolayevich, at the end. Where, in your view, do the greatest 
difficulties now lie as regards the elections to the new 
representative organs of the Russian Federation components? 
  [Samoylov] Elections will be held in the majority of regions 
20 and 27 March 1994. As far as the significance of the 
elections is concerned, the problem is the public's poor 
understanding of the new quality of the representative organs. 
Very little purposeful explanatory work is being carried out in 
this area, and far from everyone understands that they will not 
be a reproduction of the system of soviets, but fundamentally 
different representative organs. There are also difficulties of 
a purely political character. After all, these organs are to be 
formed in the absence of currently existing representative power 
in the localities, with virtually all organizational questions 
being "farmed out" to executive structures. Now the executive 
organs, tired of fighting after several years of confrontation 
with the soviets, want to obtain ineffectual representative 
organs. The Russian president, however, is committed to seeing 
that the principle of the separation of powers and the principle 
of people's power which are enshrined in the mechanism of these 
elections finally begin to operate. 
  A cause of unease is the high activity of opposition 
political forces seeking at any cost to seize a dominant 
position in the organs of power by exploiting the election 
campaign for the purposes of discrediting the president's reform 
policy. In the majority of regions the sociopolitical situation 
is pretty tense, which will undoubtedly have an impact on voter 
turnout, putting in doubt the possibility of holding elections 
in a number of regions on the dates established by edicts, or 
affect the quality of these elections. This applies to regions 
of the Far North and to Magadan Oblast. There is no experience 
of legislative activity in the regions. 
  [Dorofeyev] If I understand you correctly, the creation of 
norms governing the formation of the representative organs of 
power in the regions has been entirely transferred to the local 
executive power. But does it have some kind of coherent legal 
basis for this activity? 
  [Samoylov] Yes, undoubtedly. A series of edicts of the 
Russian Federation president on stage-by-stage constitutional 
reform were elaborated. These edicts concerned the general 
principles of the organization of state power in the federation 
components and of the reform of the organs of local 
self-government, the timetable for holding elections, the role 
of administrations in holding them, and the powers of the 
representative organs. 
  In addition there are individual articles in the Russian 
Constitution which define the level of the organs of 
self-government and the character of their activity, although 
the details are certainly not spelled out in the Fundamental Law. 
  At the moment a legal basis incorporating national, local, 
and historical features is being created in the regions on the 
basis of the president's edicts. But, insofar as the 
president's edicts are the basis of the election campaign, we do 
not want them to be discredited. Therefore, normative documents 
elaborated in the regions undergo mandatory expert analysis 
here, in the president's administration, and are invariably 
coordinated with the Central Electoral Commission. True, the 
federation components approach the creation of this legal basis 
in different ways. In Yaroslavl and Penza Oblasts and Stavropol 
Kray the matter has even gone before the courts. 
  The documents that have been adopted contain gaps, errors, 
and even deviations from juridical norms. These flaws from both 
the legal and organizational points of view are, incidentally, 
common to the majority of regions. 
  [Dorofeyev] Could you name the basic ones? 
  [Samoylov] There are several. First, as before, there is a 
noticeable gravitation toward the principle of nominating 
candidates according to the territorial administration 
principle. Thus there can be a five to sixfold difference in the 
size of the population of the various rayons of an oblast or 
kray, but there were proposals to elect an equal number of 
deputies from each. But this is a violation of the 
constitutional principle of citizens' equal suffrage. Second, 
there is the mandatory allocation of guaranteed seats for 
various national groups. Nowadays this is an unconstitutional 
norm. 
  There is so far no uniform position on the participation of 
representatives of the executive organs of power in the 
elections either. The range of opinions runs from a total ban, 
as in St. Petersburg and Nizhniy Novgorod, for example, to, in 
effect, total authorization of such participation. Thus 
following the 30 January elections in Penza Oblast, 20 of the 45 
deputies are heads of administrations or their deputies. 
  Article 66 of the the Russian Federation Constitution 
assigns 
the right to adopt the charter of a kray or oblast to the 
region's representative organ of power; however, the 
administrations of Vladimir, Vologda, and a number of other 
oblasts are trying to submit charters to local referenda. But 
the documents are crude from the legal point of view, and 
moreover, there is no law on local referenda. Thus the basis is 
laid for future conflict. 
  [Dorofeyev] However, elections have already been held in 15 
regions of Russia. Can the executive branch of power be 
considered satisfied with the outcome of these elections? 
  [Samoylov] It is mainly people of the old so-called party 
and economic aktiv who have been voted on to all the newly 
elected organs. And now, when a significant part of the budget 
will be formed at local level, the expenditure part could be 
based, not on the interest of the region, but on the collective 
or private interests of the local political or economic elite. 
This is alarming. Given such a makeup the representative 
organs of power will continue to direct their activity toward 
resolving day-to-day economic questions, although these have now 
been withdrawn from their jurisdiction. 
  A worrying trend is the virtual absence of lawyers in the 
new 
representative organs. After all, the legislative function is 
to become the basic activity of these organs. Nor are there any 
economists in the classical sense of the word. Though it is 
possible to look at these problems from another point of view. 
Voters have entrusted mandates to the people who control the 
real levers of power, and who therefore will be able to do 
something for them. 
  [Dorofeyev] Does this apply to all the federation 
components? 
  [Samoylov] In principle -- yes. There is no serious reform 
of the new organs of power even in the republics. As a result 
of elections here even the leaders have on the whole stayed the 
same, as, for example, in Aldygey, Altay, Tuva... True, reform 
has been carried out thoughtfully and effectively in 
Kabardino-Balkaria, Mariy El, and the Republic of Sakha 
(Yakutia). 
  [Dorofeyev] And are there regions where elections have taken 
place without coordination with the Central Electoral Commission? 
  [Samoylov] No, there are no such cases, but a number of 
territories have put well-argued requests to the Central 
Electoral Commission and the President's Administration to 
postpone elections to later dates. The requests of Sverdlovsk, 
Chelyabinsk, Saratov, and Krasnodar Administrations have been 
granted. Nor are objections being made to the decisions of a 
number of republics where elections will be held in summer or 
fall 1994. 
  [Dorofeyev] What forecasts can be made on the basis of the 
results of the elections which have been held in 15 regions? 
  [Samoylov] Some conclusions can be drawn already. 
Evidently, the voter turnout will be considerably lower than 
for the elections to the Federal Assembly. On the other hand, 
the competition for deputies' seats is high: between five and 
15 candidates. All parties and movements are displaying the most 
energetic and committed attention to the election campaign, but 
their leaders will not, as a rule, be elected to the local 
dumas. Therefore candidates are mainly trying to distance 
themselves from political parties (although they have a definite 
political "complexion") and prefer to stand as independent 
candidates or as representatives of groups of voters. I suggest 
that between 40 and 50 percent of deputies will turn out to be 
heads of administrations at all levels. 
  Speaking of the results as a whole, in my view it will be 
mainly people who want to be involved in practical business, and 
not in politics, who will succeed. And this will probably 
enable political disputes to be somehow avoided. God grant, as 
the saying goes, that this mood continues among deputies and 
voters alike.... 
  [Dorofeyev] And finally, Sergey Nikolayevich, a question 
which nowadays concerns many people -- the timetable for holding 
the elections. There is a very wide range of opinions here, and 
only quite recently the Russian Federation president's Public 
Chamber actually recommended that the process of holding 
elections to the representative organs of power be extended 
until June 1994. What is your opinion on this subject? 
  [Samoylov] This concerns the organs of local 
self-government. Indeed, elections were planned in 48 regions 
of Russia from January through March, but the quality of the 
legal basis raises doubts in many political forces. 
  The executive at the local level proceeds on the premise 
that 
simultaneous elections will help to increase voter turnout and 
save money. The president's administration shares the concern 
of the Public Chamber. 
  From our point of view, it more correct to hold elections to 
the regional representative organ of power first. It elaborates 
and ratifies the normative basis for the organs of local 
self-government, using the existing administration documents and 
the edicts of the Russian Federation president. 
  Though I have already said that there is no strict 
regulation 
as to the timeframes...

  [Text] Murmansk, 14 Mar -- Two of the four generating sets 
at the Kola nuclear power station were shut down today because 
of various faults. A routine shutdown of another reactor is 
planned for 22 March. 
  Bearing in mind that the station provides more than 60 
percent of all the electricity generated in Murmansk Oblast, it 
is not difficult to imagine the consequences. It is not only 
enterprises on the Kola Peninsula that will suffer. In the 
first place, "supplies of electricity to neighboring Karelia and 
Leningrad Oblast will be halted," Vitaliy Meshkov, general 
director of the Kola power system said today at a meeting with 
the head of the oblast administration. 
  Apart from purely technical faults, the work of Europe's 
northernmost nuclear power station has been affected by debts 
owed by consumers, including some in neighboring Karelia. The 
shortage of resources is preventing power engineers at the Kola 
station from carrying out maintenance work on time and 
recharging the reactors with nuclear fuel according to schedule. 
Although top Moscow ministry officials and the Russian 
Government know about the disastrous situation at the nuclear 
power station, the power engineers are not receiving any help 
from them. In addition, because of unprecedented customs 
tariffs, they cannot even obtain equipment provided as aid by 
firms in Scandinavian countries to ensure the safe operation of 
the nuclear power station. 
  In view of the critical situation, senior officials from the 
station and the Kola grid will fly to Moscow tomorrow, in order 
to inform the head of government of this personally and to ask 
him to adopt measures.

  [Text] The government is apparently to get involved in 
solving the problems of reciprocal nonpayments between 
enterprises. [First Deputy Prime Minister] Oleg Soskovets 
announced at a news conference today that this is really a 
problem for enterprise managers to resolve. The first deputy 
prime minister is of the view that nonpayments are the result of 
poor management and badly organized relations between suppliers 
and consumers. 
  As for the wage arrears in a number of industries, the 
Ministry of Labor has been instructed to investigate and to take 
measures. Soskovets reiterated that the government intends to 
strengthen the role of the state in economic development. It is 
not yet clear how this will look in practice, as Oleg Soskovets 
was not inclined to talk specifics. He answered questions with 
either platitudes or statements such as: The government is 
studying this problem, or the government is working on this. 
  Incidentally, Soskovets' meeting with journalists today was 
the first of a series of news conferences on the implentation of 
the program of economic reforms in the period up to 1995. We 
will probably hear specific answers to all issues later.

message. The first deputy prime minister named the following 
among priority areas in the economy: The fuel and power complex, 
industry, agriculture, conversion, and restructuring of the 
social sphere. Commenting on information by Yegor Gaydar that 
the draft budget provides for an increase in expenditure on the 
upkeep of the state apparatus and not for social needs, Oleg 
Soskovets said: 
  [Begin recording] [Soskovets] It is the normal thing that 
when the state apparatus increases, the social sphere is reduced. 
  [Aldoshina] But still, precisely this situation is set out 
in 
the draft budget, isn't it? 
  [Soskovets] We have not yet put out the draft budget 
anywhere. [end recording] 
  [Aldoshina] The draft budget, according to the first deputy 
prime minister, may be passed on to the State Duma this week. 
Commenting on the question of Gaydar's intention to return to 
the government, Oleg Soskovets said: That is his problem. [end

  [Text] Moscow March 14 TASS -- Russian Economic Minister 
Aleksandr Shokhin met U.S. ex-President Richard Nixon on Monday 
to discuss relations between Russia and international 
organizations. 
  Shokhin described some peculiarities of the economic reform 
in Russia at a press conference following the meeting. 
  Acceptance of "the debts of the former Soviet Union, the 
burden of Russia's "donorhood" in regard to other CIS member 
states" make economic transformations in the country peculiar. 
In this connection, he confirmed that the government intends 
"to go ahead with reserved financial policies". 
  "On the one hand, the cabinet succeeded in getting the 
inflation rate down to an all-time low of 9.9 percent, on the 
other - the slump in production continues to grow, which results 
in a drop in efficacy of tax extraction as a whole," Shokhin 
said as he described contradictory nature of the current 
situation in Russia. 
  According to Shokhin, the government will "find it hard to 
keep within the planned limits of the budget deficit", unless it 
takes "extraordinary measures and looks for new sources of 
income". When working out the draft budget, "several 
expenditure items should be specified, including national 
defence expenses", Shokhin said.

  [Text] Moscow March 14 TASS -- The Russian Government "will 
be able to keep monthly inflation within ten per cent" in the 
next few months, according to Russian Minister of Economics 
Aleksandr Shokhin. The announcement was made at his meeting 
with former U.S. President Richard Nixon who is in Moscow on a 
private visit. 
  Shokhin said that the adoption of the budget is a key 
element 
in the activity of the government, stressing that the 
government's "moral status will depend" on the results of the 
debates on the draft budget in the State Duma. 
  Shokhin noted that monthly inflation in February was below 
ten per cent, the record low in the last 2.5 years. "We 
promised to the IMF to reach this level only by the end of the 
year," Shokhin said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Vasiliy Vorobyev, chief of </F>
the Russian Federation Defense Ministry Main Military Budget and 
Finance Directorate, by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Ivanyuk; date 
and place not given: "Military Budget Without Abstractions Or 
Illusions"] 
  [Text] This interview could have been justified on a 
purely routine basis: The federal budget for the new year is 
being adopted, it is necessary to talk about expenditure on the 
country's defenses. But it is hard to recall such a powerful 
upsurge in public interest in an event that is, generally 
speaking, a "formality." The editorial office has received 
numerous queries prompted by reports appearing in the mass media 
to the effect that it is planned to slash the military budget 
and that many articles of the Law on the Status of Servicemen 
could be repealed, reports which have caused concern among our 
readers. Last year's "budget tribulations," delays of two or 
three months in paying wages and servicemen's pay, disruptions 
to leave, and unfulfilled plans are still fresh in many people's 
memories. Is all this going to be repeated this year, only 
worse? We decided to seek first-hand answers, so to speak, to 
this and other questions which are currently of concern to Army 
and Navy personnel, workers at defense enterprises, and Armed 
Forces veterans. 
  [Ivanyuk] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, the Finance Ministry's 
attempts to save on military spending have already been the 
subject of a political assessment: The proposed level of 
appropriations will lead to the ruin of the country's defense 
complex, and in particular the Russian Army, which is basically 
the sole island of stability on the territory of the former 
USSR.... 
  [Vorobyev] I am no politician, and I would like to refrain 
from commentaries of that kind. As far as the military budget 
is concerned, I am prepared to speak about it in detail and to 
cite illustrations to confirm the validity and authenticity of 
every figure. The sums we are asking for are not plucked out of 
thin air. The need for defense appropriations for 1994 is 
defined in accordance with the requirements of the Russian 
Federation Law "On Defense," which envisages a reduction in the 
Armed Forces, taking into account the State Defense Order 
approved by the Russian Federation Government decree of 21 
December 1993 and decisions recently adopted by the country's 
top leadership on questions of defense, the financial 
stabilization of the economy, and state social support for the 
population. 
  We are aware that the Russian economy is currently going 
through a difficult period. Therefore the calculations sent to 
the Finance Ministry contain nothing superfluous. The proposed 
draft has, above all, a clearly expressed social thrust. The 
Defense Ministry pins great hopes on Russian Federation 
President B.N. Yeltsin's Message, his speech in the Federal 
Assembly on 24 February this year. He said quite specifically: 
"In 1994 we have to put an end to the deleterious practice of 
one-sided concessions. This applies, among other things, to the 
defense budget. It must not be forgotten that spending on 
defense is not at all the same thing as spending on war. These 
resources go to finance a significant part of our science. 
These resources go to build apartments for homeless officers' 
families. These resources go to maintain our children who are 
serving in the Armed Forces." 
  [Ivanyuk] What does this mean in actual figures? 
  [Vorobyev] I do not think there is any point in naming 
specific sums. These have not yet been finally confirmed, and 
anyway, given the present rate of inflation, they do not tell 
you much. If we look at relative figures, 56 percent of the 
total military budget consists of expenditure on servicemen's 
pay and wages for civilian personnel, paying for rations and 
pensions, building housing, maintaining military hospitals, 
clinics, sanatoriums, rest homes, and kindergartens, and 
carrying out tasks in connection with the provision of 
facilities for troops withdrawn from Eastern Europe and the 
nearby foreign countries. Furthermore, the appropriations for 
the purchase of arms and military equipment and on scientific 
research and experimental and design work also include relevant 
expenditure at defense complex enterprises, which accounts for 
at least 45 percent of the total. Thus social expenditure, or, 
to put it another way, the minimum expenditure necessary for 
people's normal existence, accounts for a total of three-fourths 
of all defense expenditure. 
  [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA interpolation] Our Information: The 
Finance Ministry has cut by a factor of 2.4 the sum requested by 
the Defense Ministry. The amount allowed for maintaining the 
Army and Navy is set at 61 percent of the sum requested; for 
arms, military equipment, and property -- 21 percent; for 
scientific and technical output -- 41 percent; for capital 
construction and major repairs -- 32 percent; and for 
servicemen's pensions -- 76 percent. 
  In January 1994, 1 trillion rubles [R] was paid over to the 
Defense Ministry. Appropriations under the quota established by 
the Finance Ministry for February, totaling R1.3 trillion, were 
transferred bit by bit, up to 10 March. There was a chronic 
shortage of money. And the R371 billion which it is planned to 
allocate in March for maintaining the Army and Navy (under 
section one of the military budget) is not enough even to cover 
the servicemen's pay. [interpolation ends] 
  [Ivanyuk] One cannot help getting the impression that the 
Finance Ministry's proposals for cutting the military budget are 
divorced from real life and are purely theoretical and abstract 
in nature.... 
  [Vorobyev] This approach could indeed be called abstract. 
And not only because the "human factor," as they used to call 
it, is not taken into account. Take the actual methodology of 
the calculations. The Finance Ministry, in planning defense 
spending, takes as a basis the proportion of gross domestic 
product (GDP) accounted for by military spending in 1993, and 
automatically carries over this indicator, namely 5.02 percent, 
to this year's GDP. But tell me, what is the basis for 
calculating that GDP will increase by only a factor of 4.5? 
What decline or increase in production does this incorporate? 
What account is taken of the dynamic of price increases? It 
must be said that last year the Finance Ministry failed to take 
account of the actual trends in prices for output purchased by 
the Defense Ministry. For instance, budget expenditure on the 
purchase of arms and military equipment in 1993 was 
index-linked, in the main, by a factor of 2.1, although in a 
number of instances the actual increase was between fivefold and 
12-fold. Or take military uniform. This sustained a 10- or 
11-fold increase in price over the year. At the beginning of 
this year a complete soldier's uniform cost R500,000. 
  Many other objective factors were -- and are -- absolutely 
left out of the reckoning. At the moment, in essence, all 
Russia's Armed Forces are in motion: The troops' withdrawal is 
in progress, they are changing stations, their structure is 
changing, expenditure on the provision of facilities is 
increasing. It takes 55 trains just to move one motorized 
infantry division. You can imagine the other expenses that this 
entails. And maintaining military camps beyond the Urals, which 
is where a significant proportion of troop units and formations 
have been redeployed, is much more expensive than in the 
European part of the former USSR. The Finance Ministry also 
takes no account of the actual tasks tackled by the Russian Army 
and Navy in the present difficult situation. But fulfilling 
peacekeeping functions in the "hot spots" costs the Armed Forces 
far more, of course, than systematic training in stationary 
conditions. So we want just one thing: for Finance Ministry 
workers to grasp once and for all the volume and structure of 
the military budget, and not to try to mislead the government 
about it every time. 
  [Ivanyuk] Another question that arises is: Why take as a 
basis this bizarre figure of 5.02 percent -- with hundredths of 
a percent -- of GDP? This comparison with last year would be 
logical if last year's finances had been optimum, or at least 
satisfactory. But that is not so. And defense funds were saved 
in a manner directly detrimental to combat readiness. Because 
of the fuel shortage, combat training plans were not met, planes 
did not fly, ships lay rusting at the quayside, equipment did 
not get repaired, housing was not built, food reserves were not 
renewed, and so forth. And moreover, on the results of the 
year, the Defense Ministry ended up a major debtor.... 
  [Vorobyev] To this day we have yet to settle up with all 
the suppliers of military equipment and property, supplies, and 
services. Out of a debt which totaled R2.2 trillion at the 
beginning of the year, only 1 trillion has been extinguished. 
Overall, the Defense Ministry's minimum requirement for 
appropriations of R10 trillion was only 75 percent fulfilled 
last year, taking the repayment of debts into account. The 
Finance Ministry could have achieved a still more gratifying 
picture and a still lower proportional level of defense spending 
this year if, last year, it had allocated not 75 percent, but, 
say, 50 or 40 percent of what the Army and Navy needed. Let's 
think straight: How much longer can the Armed Forces be kept 
without money, with only insignificant sums being allocated 
eight or 10 times a month, as has been the case for nearly a 
year? For another six months? A year? And then what? 
  Some people declare that in the developed countries of the 
West, military spending accounts for not more than 3-5 percent 
of gross national product. Those who think this fail to take 
account of one thing -- the actual volume of GNP in those 
countries and in ours is not comparable. As a result the sums 
allocated for defense are not comparable either. And it is not 
a question of "flexing military muscles"; the point is that the 
reform of the Russian Army and Navy should be carried out 
gradually, without sociopolitical upheavals. Nor can we 
disregard the country's geopolitical location, the role that 
Russia continues to play in the world community, the structure 
of the Armed Forces, and many other factors. 
  [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA interpolation] Our Information: In 1994 
the U.S. GNP will be in excess of $6 trillion, and total 
military expenditure will be $280 billion, which comes to about 
$1,100 for every citizen of America. In the current year, total 
military spending per capita will be $730 in Britain, $810 in 
France, $815 in Norway, and $500 in Greece and the FRG. 
  [Vorobyev continues] It must also be taken into account that 
ever since 1989, even while the Soviet Union still existed, 
expenditure on defense has fallen every year, mainly through 
reducing the numerical strength of the Army and Navy and cutting 
purchases of arms and military equipment. 
  It would theoretically be possible to adopt the 
appropriations included in the draft budget for 1994 at the 
levels proposed by the Russian Finance Ministry. But the real 
consequences of that step must be borne in mind. What does it 
mean, for instance, if the Defense Ministry purchases 20-25 
percent of the arms and military equipment stipulated in the 
State Order for 1994? Not only a reduction in the troops' 
combat capability and an irreversible lag in defense production 
technology, but also the stoppage of many enterprises and a mass 
upsurge in unemployment. Let us look at another item of 
expenditure. Given the proposed level of finance for housing 
construction, servicemen will fail to receive 24,000 apartments 
planned in the State Defense Order for 1994. The number of 
homeless families in the Army and Navy could rise to 155,000 by 
the end of the year as a result. Need I continue the list? 
  I am convinced that everyone in the Russian Armed Forces, 
from the defense minister to any private doing his compulsory 
service, would agree to a devastating budget for the Army if he 
knew that it would result in an economic miracle in the near 
future. But miracles do not happen, and the only way to produce 
any tangible results in terms of economic recovery is to add to 
the income side of the budget, not to manipulate its expenditure 
side. As for making economical use of the resources allocated, 
we are prepared to make savings and we are doing everything to 
that end. 
  [Ivanyuk] As you know, the Ministry of Labor recently put a 
proposal to the government to increase the minimum wage by 40 
percent from 1 March. The adoption of this decision will entail 
an increase in wages in the budget sphere. Many of our readers 
are worried: Could it turn out that the military will once 
again be left to last? After all, last year it was the rule -- 
and this "rule" is regarded as an outrage -- to increase 
servicemen's pay a month later, or to a lesser extent, than for 
other "budget-funded" people. 
  [Vorobyev] I hope this will not happen. We have submitted 
appropriate proposals regarding the indexation of servicemen's 
pay and the wages of the Defense Ministry's civilian personnel, 
and it would be nice to think that the proposals will be taken 
fully into account. At the same time the concern that has 
arisen in military collectives is understandable: Some people 
are not above making savings even here, at the expense of the 
soldier or the officer. Thus, in similar conditions the Finance 
Ministry has twice tried to index-link only servicemen's pay, 
"forgetting" about allowances for rank. But the Finance 
Ministry is not the government, and the government did not 
permit such "innovations." We have repeatedly been aware of 
Prime Minister V.S. Chernomyrdin's support on these matters. 
After all, our proposals are not based on excessive demands. 
It would be possible to forget about incomplete indexation or 
delays in it, if the soldier's job was among those that are 
highly paid. But in reality the picture is different. Let us 
take, for comparison, a pilot in civil aviation and a military 
airman. They experience similar psychological and physical 
stresses, they bear the same high responsibility. How does the 
state value their labor? A captain at Sheremetyevo-2 gets up to 
R3 million a month. That sum is made up of the salary, with the 
addition of the sector coefficient and other supplementary 
coefficients, additional payments for qualifications, unhealthy 
working conditions, and length of service, bonuses, and other 
payments, such as payments for total flying time per month, the 
commander's minimum landing payment, payment for working 
particularly difficult routes.... In the Russian Air Force a 
plane's captain, a major and first-class pilot with 15 or more 
years of service, receives something like R400,000 a month, that 
is, between one-fifth and one-sixth as much. This includes 
everything -- supplements for length of service, qualifications, 
special conditions of service and material aid, and the lump sum 
on the results of the year, calculated per month. 
  [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA interpolation] Our Information: In 
1909-1917 a captain or company commander in the Russian Army 
used to receive per year: salary -- R900, mess allowance -- 
R360, additional pay -- R480 (total: R1,740). In addition he 
was paid a lodging allowance of up to R544 a year, expenses for 
acquiring essential kit in field conditions and for the purchase 
of a horse, harness, carriage, etc., batman money of R10, and 
ration money (campaign and field rations in wartime). For a 
captain, the campaign allowance was R1.57, and the field 
allowance R3.50 per day. 
  According to the draft State Income and Expenditure 
Inventory 
for 1912, a worker's average wage was R244 a year. 
  At the beginning of the 20th century in Russia a kilogram of 
bread cost 6-15 kopeks, meat 17-33 kopeks, sugar 37 kopeks, 
butter 62-70 kopeks, a liter of vodka was 48-60 kopeks, a pair 
of shoes R3, and a pair of boots R7. 
  [Vorobyev continues] Throughout the world, a soldier's work 
is paid more highly than work requiring similar effort in 
civilian sectors, and everywhere there is a highly developed 
system of concessions. And this is easy to explain: A person 
who is not bound by an oath or the requirements of military 
regulations is free to change his job if something -- such as 
the pay -- does not suit him. But where is a nuclear submarine 
commander -- who, incidentally, receives no more than a fighter 
pilot -- to go, if he does decide to sever his ties with the 
military department, at great cost to himself? There should be 
compensation for servicemen, in the form of higher wages, for 
restrictions of this kind on civil rights. And for other 
drawbacks -- the nomadic way of life, the lack of opportunity 
for wives to find jobs, etc. It must be said that this approach 
is enshrined in the Law on the Status of Servicemen, but in 
practice, unfortunately, the law is not realized as it should be. 
  In terms of cost, the law has only been half implemented. 
The reason is well known -- the relevant provisions of the law 
are not backed up by an implementation mechanism, and 
appropriations have not been allocated. In this connection we 
receive many complaints from the troops and from Defense 
Ministry pensioners, to which it is impossible to give a 
satisfactory reply. Civil and military courts have recently 
been issuing rulings practically every day in favor of 
servicemen and Armed Forces veterans who appeal over violations 
of their rights to privileges laid down in existing legislation. 
But even the court decisions lead nowhere. To crown it all, 
the mass media blame the defense minister and the services under 
him for not fulfilling laws signed by the president of the 
Russian Federation. 
  [Ivanyuk] But as if it was not enough that after more than a 
year this law has not even become fully operational, there have 
also been -- and still are -- attempts to "torpedo" it, to 
revoke privileges for servicemen and their families, including 
some that have existed for a long time. Just the other day 
people in the Army were disturbed by the news that the Finance 
Ministry has spawned yet another proposal for cutting 
servicemen's privileges. The impression is that some people are 
deliberately "inflaming" the atmosphere in the military 
collectives.... 
  [Vorobyev] First of all, I would like to stress that the 
Army and Navy have no fabulous, extraordinary privileges -- in 
the main they correspond to the system of benefits and 
compensations that have become established in our country. For 
instance, members of many professions receive free uniform, are 
able to supplement their wardrobes at half price, enjoy free 
travel to and from their vacation center or free food, or have 
privileges under housing or, say, land legislation. 
  But for some reason there are proposals to repeal or suspend 
the operation of certain laws, edicts, and decrees in connection 
with social guarantees specifically for servicemen. Some of 
these proposals can only be described as ludicrous. For 
instance, it is proposed to retain the food ration, but anyone 
who declines to take it, instead of being compensated for its 
full value, would be paid compensation equivalent to one minimum 
wage. But everyone will simply start taking the rations, and 
that will considerably complicate the task of procuring, 
storing, and issuing food and will entail additional costs. 
That is why the prime minister, in his interview for a RIA 
correspondent, described such proposals, bluntly but, I believe, 
rightly, as "real blackmail." 
  [Ivanyuk] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, I cannot but agree with what 
you say, so do not take the next question, which is rather 
awkward, as an attempt to engage in a dispute. I have often 
heard it said, even at high levels, that the stance of the 
Defense Ministry, which is demanding to be fully financed in 
conditions of an acute budget deficit, is unproductive and 
inappropriate to a market economy. How would you comment on that 
view? 
  [Vorobyev] I too have heard such views expressed. On the 
one hand, they are rather superficial, and on the other, they do 
not show good will. The theory that was once current, that 
social problems in the Army and Navy could and should be tackled 
by the use of extrabudgetary funds, has yet to bear fruit. The 
actual return on the numerous funds set up in this context is 
close to zero. And how can anyone seriously talk about 
maintaining -- even partially maintaining -- the army of a vast 
country like Russia on, so to speak, a voluntary basis? This is 
the state's task, and the state should take care of it in full. 
And a rigorous financial policy should be aimed at securing the 
military budget as a priority, not at reducing it. 
  The Russian Defense Ministry is today placed within very 
tight bounds and is virtually without the possibility of earning 
resources. As an example, let me cite the sale of surplus 
property, as a result of which 1,600 apartments were acquired 
for servicemen last year. Yet on many other questions a far 
stricter system of restrictions has been imposed than in foreign 
states' armies, which are incomparably better financed. Thus, 
for instance, in Turkey a huge entrepreneurial structure 
operates under the patronage of the Armed Forces, including 
dozens of enterprises, as well as banks, and this makes it 
possible to provide additional social protection for servicemen. 
There are dozens of other projects which could be implemented 
in the Russian Armed Forces to rectify their financial position. 
In this respect we are urgently studying possible options with 
the Finance Ministry and other economic departments. 
  [Ivanyuk] It would be nice to think that everything you have 
spoken of is at the center of the attention of the government 
and parliamentarians as they set about examining the country's 
budget for 1994, and that the Defense Ministry's interests will 
all be taken into account. 
  [Vorobyev] We are hoping for that, too. Only I would make 
one small reservation: The proposals we have submitted on the 
military budget are dictated not by departmental interests, but 
by concern for maintaining the country's defense capability at 
least at the minimum necessary level. I would like to believe 
that the State Duma, the Federation Council, and the government 
understand this and will take account of all the circumstances 
in making their final decision.

today. For example, today the Ministry of Communications is 
cutting us off from all channels of transmission of video 
material from other cities and countries. Yes, talking 
on-screen for 20 minutes is not one of the easiest tasks for a 
newscaster. It seems that Russians will have to do without 
bright pictures as well as having to do without good-quality 
bread. Well, that's enough gloomy news; we do have something to 
boast about: We are the national TV station.

<F P=106> [Comment by Anatoliy Lysenko, general director of Russian </F>
State Television and Radio Company, under general headline: 
"Tales from the Vienna Woods" -- last paragraph is editorial 
postscript] 
  [Text] We asked Anatoliy Lysenko, general director of the 
Russian State Television and Radio Company, to comment on the 
situation which has taken shape: 
  Last week the Ministry of Finance drew up another draft 
state 
budget. I do not know how good or bad it is in other spheres, 
but as regards the state television and radio companies.... 
Under this draft, which has not yet been approved by the 
government, it is proposed to allocate for the funding of the 
television and radio company, on average, approximately 
one-fourth of the amount that we need for a minimum normal 
existence. This means that Russian radio, for example, will be 
broadcasting for something like five hours a day, and Russian 
television even less -- four hours and 20 minutes. So we will 
have to distribute our air time roughly as follows: from 0730 
through 0900 hours for those who are already awake. From 1600 
through 1730 for children, so that they do not forget that the 
television has been invented. In the evening it will be 
possible to put out "Vesti," followed by a 10- or 15-minute 
program with a topical account of the government's concern for 
its people. 
  I certainly do not think that the quality of all our 
programs 
is on a high level. And yet an important question occurs to me 
with regard to this draft budget: What does the Finance 
Ministry expect those people who are accustomed to sitting on 
the sofa in front of the television after work in the evening to 
do with themselves if the television set is showing nothing? We 
could think up a lot of answer to this question, but none of 
them in society's favor. This is not to mention the fact that 
we will have to dismiss three-fourths of our employees without a 
leaving gratuity.... As is known, we were born to turn a 
fairytale into a true story. Sometimes it is a very frightening 
fairytale. Although I am a great fan of science fiction, I find 
it hard to believe that, before approving the draft, the 
government will review the question of television funding. But 
there is still a glimmer of hope. 
  [Postcript] While this issue was being made up, the problem 
of funding state television and radio companies has developed 
further. The president has met with the heads of "Ostankino" 
and the Russian State Television and Radio Company and promised 
them support, saying that there must definitely be state 
television in Russia. "Although the budget will be cut just the 
same," Anatoliy Lysenko declared after meeting with the 
president. "The question is: by how much? But the government 
must decide this."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "In Brief" rubric: "Who </F>
Calls the Shots at Ostankino?"] 
  [Text] To all appearances, Aleksandr Yakovlev, current 
chief of the federal television service, has virtually no role 
to play there; the shots in the television empire are called by 
his first deputy, Valentin Lazutkin, who has been orienting 
himself toward Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. 
  MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has learned from an informed source 
that things have gone so far that the list of news items for the 
21:00 "Novosti" news program is sent during the day to 
Government Press Service chief Sergeyev for approval. A report 
on Yegor Gaydar's recent press conference is a case in point: 
His quips about Chernomyrdin and "laboratory chiefs" liberally 
quoted by the mass media have disappeared without a trace, and 
Yegor Timurovich himself was portrayed as an apologizing retiree.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's Status </F>
Determined"] 
  [Text] A contract has been concluded between the Russian 
Federation Government and the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA editorial 
office. It was signed 10 March in the Russian Federation 
Government House by V.P. Kvasov, Russian Federation minister and 
leader of the Russian Federation Government Apparatus, and 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA Chief Editor N.I. Polezhayeva. 
  These documents define the rights and duties of the Russian 
Federation Government as the newspaper's founder and editorial 
office. Perhaps for the first time relations between an 
official publication and its founder are built on a legal and 
civilized basis. Previously, as we remember, the operational 
administration of a newspaper right up to instructions over the 
telephone was considered normal. The editorial office's new 
charter and the above-mentioned contract unequivocally forbid 
the founder to interfere in the activity of the editorial 
office. And if we are speaking of control then the contract 
envisages it only in relation to finances. 
  That is entirely natural inasmuch as the government will 
assign funds to its newspaper. But not 100 percent of the 
funds, as used to be the case, not to feed an expense mechanism, 
but in fact for finished output -- for the preparation, 
publication, and mass distribution of the state's official 
documents. 
  But that does not mean that ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA can become a 
departmental bulletin. According to the contract the Russian 
Federation Government has the right to publish its own official 
materials in the newspaper free of charge. Federal and regional 
organs of executive power and the structural subdivisions of the 
government apparatus build their relations with the editorial 
office on a contract basis. 
  With the signing of the contract ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's status 
has been definitively determined as an official state 
publication.

  [Text] As you know, the process of the disintegration of 
the USSR and sovereignization of the republics within Russia was 
accompanied by a forced introduction to the Russian language of 
new names of some states, republics, their capitals, and some 
cities. At the same time, in most cases it was an attempt to 
replace the names adopted in the Russian language with the names 
in the languages of these states, republics, and cities. 
However, in any language any borrowed word is always 
subordinated to new grammar and pronunciation laws and, in 
practice, never retains its original form. 
  Therefore Russian language speakers have as many rights to 
pronounce Ashkhabad, Kushka, Kirgizia, and Belorussia, as 
speakers of other languages, for example, have every right to 
use Russian names in the form adopted in their languages. In 
this particular case it is correspondence to linguistic laws 
that is under discussion. 
  The Institute of Russian Language of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences supports the intention to go back to old names. From 
15 March, Russian television and radio will begin using them 
consistently so that from now on Almaty will again become 
Alma-Ata, Bashkortostan -- Bashkiria. Our congratulations to 
you. 
  It would be interesting to know what will be the reaction at 
the Ostankino TV and Radio Company since this initiative comes 
from the Russian TV and Radio Company.

<F P=106> [Correspondent Yuriy Nikiforenko report: "From Arabian </F>
Desert to Orenburg Steppes. Context of Joint Exercises"] 
  [Text] Orenburg City -- Forty years ago nuclear weapons 
tests in the atmosphere were carried out at the Totskoye test 
site in Orenburg Oblast. Many of those who happened to be in 
the area of the dangerous experiment are suffering from the 
tests' effects to this day. 
  Totskoye test site was recently visited by Brigadier General 
Leonard Holder Jr., commander of the U.S. Army 3d Infantry 
Division. He was studying preparations for the tactical 
exercises scheduled for summer 1994 in the southern Urals in the 
same places where the atomic epoch left its tragic mark four 
decades ago. 
  Who is Holder? What constitutes a U.S. division? The U.S. 
general fought in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait and has a 
master's degree in European history. He once taught at a 
military academy. He has written a number of books on tactics 
and the art of warfare. 
  The 3d Division, which Holder commands, is armed with the 
latest military equipment. It consists of over 18,000 people, 
290 tanks, 600 armored fighting vehicles and armored personnel 
carriers, 220 artillery pieces including nine multiple 
rocket-launchers, and 127 helicopters, 44 of them attack 
helicopters. The division has a signals battalion as well as 
mass destruction weapons protection and military police 
companies. 
  It must be stressed that during Operation Desert Storm 
alone, 
which was notorious for its ferocity, the U.S division destroyed 
105 enemy tanks and armored personnel carriers and captured over 
800 soldiers. Currently 1,100 of the division's soldiers are in 
Kuwait or on the Turkish-Iraqi border. Holder is now apparently 
ready to pass on his combat experience of massacring an enemy to 
Russian soldiers, in particular the personnel of the 27th 
Russian Division at the Totskoye test site. Our division 
consists of 8,000 soldiers and is equipped with tanks, armored 
personnel carriers, self-propelled guns, mortars, and multiple 
rocket-launcher systems. 
  The public in the Orenburg and Volga regions, concerned by 
the unfolding events, are protesting strongly against the 
scheduled exercises. Exactly what kind of joint "peacekeeping" 
tasks can be being tackled here is a complete mystery. A number 
of sociopolitical organizations in Samara and Orenburg Oblasts 
have adopted a joint statement in which they strongly protest 
about the two divisions' "peacekeeping" combat operations. 
Especially as these exercises are extremely dangerous in a 
region saturated with the defense industry. This area is 
Russia's bread basket. Let us not forget that the Orenburg 
region is a border oblast neighboring Kazakhstan. The 
saber-rattling could alarm peoples with whom we have lived on 
good terms. 
  The statement was supported by the oblast organizations of 
the Russian Federation Communist Party, the Russian Communist 
Workers' Party, the Agrarian Party of Russia, the Socialist 
Party of the Working People, the "For Social Justice" voters' 
association, the Union of Officers, and veterans' and other 
organizations. 
  A large group of candidates for Orenburg Oblast's 
legislative 
assembly has protested. 
  The text of the document was handed over to Vladimir 
Nikolayevich Volkov, State Duma deputy from Orsk Electoral 
District No. 133 and member of the committee for defense 
questions, at a meeting with voters.

  [Excerpt] Sochi, 15 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin, who arrived in Sochi on Monday on a brief 
vacation, met with Nikolay Yegorov, head of Krasnodar Kray, the 
same day. 
  Nikolay Yegorov told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that the 
president showed that he is very well informed about business 
and political life in the Kuban. He enquired about the course 
of spring field work, and the provision of Russia's breadbasket 
with fuel, mineral fertilizers, and other material and technical 
resources on the eve of the new sowing campaign. 
  Nikolay Yegorov said that the president paid particular 
attention to discussing the problems of Krasnodar Kray as a 
territory on Russia's southern border. Issues of the migration 
of the population from CIS "trouble spots" were discussed. The 
president agreed with the proposal by the kray's leadership 
temporarily to introduce a visa regime on the territory of 
Krasnodar Kray while the acute situations in the Transcaucasus 
region continue. Nikolay Yegorov said that the Russian 
leadership will apparently adopt an appropriate document on this 
matter very soon. 
  The conversation lasted about five hours. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Shtatnov: "Viktor Chernomyrdin: `A Major </F>
Undertaking For Russia'"] 
  [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast -- Last November's land and 
property auctions at the "Pravdinskiy" sovkhoz in Nizhniy 
Novgorod Oblast were a kind of prologue to new approaches to 
agrarian reform at local level. It had been preceded by two 
years of evaluation, calculation, and observation of the life 
and work of country people both in remote parts and in the 
environs of the oblast center. This was done by Russian 
specialists in conjunction with experts from the International 
Finance Corporation. Its product was the Nizhniy Novgorod model 
of land reform. 
  What are its main features? The principles of voluntary 
participation by farms and peasants on the basis of their 
decision to privatize land and reorganize farms; freedom of 
choice, whereby farm members decide on their own sphere of 
activity; and priority farm members of farms, including 
pensioners, when it comes to the acquisition of property and 
land. And a strong legislative base as well. 
  Since the beginning of the year, land auctions have been 
held 
in other farms in the oblast; a total of six farms in different 
soil and climatic zones in the region were the pioneers. Nearly 
40 kolkhozes, joint-stock companies, and sovkhozes are waiting 
in line, wanting to employ the new system. 
  It must be said that an active quest for agrarian reform 
options has been conducted of late in Tula, Moscow, and Orel 
Oblasts and in other regions of Russia. Which one will provide 
the foundation? 
  It is better to see once than to hear 100 times, as they 
say. 
No doubt this is what prompted V. Chernomyrdin, chairman of the 
Russian Federation government; A. Zaveryukha and A. Chubays, his 
deputies; V. Khlystun, minister of agriculture and food; and 
leading officials of a number of Russian ministries recently to 
spend a few days studying land reform on the spot, in Nizhniy 
Novgorod Oblast. The leaders of nearly 40 Russian oblasts, 
krays, and autonomous okrugs went to the oblast to size up the 
situation. The VIP's attended an auction, held this time at the 
Kolkhoz named for the 60th Anniversary of October, in 
Gorodetskiy Rayon. 
  The subsequent discussion involving the government head, the 
hosts, and the guests touched on the local land reform program 
that had been presented and ways of getting the Russian 
agroindustrial complex out of the current crisis. According to 
V. Chernomyrdin, who attended the auction and familiarized 
himself with the oblast's specific actions and plans, we are all 
participating in a "major undertaking in Russia," the main aim 
of which is to get owners to develop agricultural production. 
  Concerning the agrarian program created within the confines 
of the Nizhniy Novgorod region, the prime minister noted that it 
could become a national program, although it would have to be 
refined by the different regions. Viktor Stepanovich also 
backed the idea of creating a cadre center in Nizhniy Novgorod 
to train reform specialists. 
  During his stay in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast, V. Chernomyrdin 
visited the "NITEL" joint-stock company and met with the leaders 
of industrial and defense enterprises and oblast administration 
chiefs. 
  A. Zaveryukha, deputy chairman of the Russian government, V. 
Khlystun, minister of agriculture, and representatives of the 
Finance Ministry and Land Reform Committee visited the 
Chernyshikhinskiy meat-packing plant that is being constructed 
in Kstovskiy Rayon and the "Rossiya" collective enterprise. The 
conference with the oblast's agroindustrial aktiv that followed 
discussed various agricultural production matters.

  [Text] During the Monday closed parliamentary hearings at 
the Council of the Federation the President of Ingushetiya 
Ruslan Aushev called for the introduction of direct presidential 
rule in Prigorodny region of North Ossetia. After the hearings 
he told journalists that during the time of direct presidential 
rule talks should be held between the presidents of Ingushetiya 
and North Ossetia "till the situation becomes stable". 
Prigorodnyy region is a disputed territory between Ossetians 
and Ingushes. 
  "I am against the abolition of the state of emergency, but 
it 
should be restricted to the area where the conflict broke out", 
Aushev said. 
  The president of North Ossetia Akhsarbek Galazov also spoke 
favorably of the hearings and described them as another step to 
peace in the Northern Caucasus and stability in North Ossetia 
and Ingushetiya. 
  According to Galazov, territorial claims and the attempt to 
seize part of Prigorodnyy region by force were the initial cause 
of the Ossetian-Ingush tragedy. "The implementation of the 
decree of President Yeltsin on the return of refugees to their 
home places should begin with the first clause that declares 
Prigorodnyy region an integral part of North Ossetia", Galazov 
said. 
  He said that the Russian president, government and Federal 
Assembly face the task of ruling out "any territorial changes, 
and not only in the Northern Caucasus". The integrity of Russia 
can be preserved only in this way, Galazov thinks. 
  Galazov spoke for a comprehensive approach to the refugee 
problem. He called absolutely wrong the reduction of the matter 
to the return of Ingush refugees alone. He said that for three 
and a half years 47,500 refugees from former Soviet republics 
have been living in North Ossetia, among them Ossetians, Azeris, 
Armenians and Russians. Their number continues to grow. 
  In Galazov's opinion official talks between Vladikavkaz and 
Nazran which are now being prepared can begin at the end of 
March or beginning of April. He said the meeting could see the 
signing of a package of documents to settle the situation. 
  The North Ossetian president expressed his sharply negative 
attitude to the proposal to introduce direct presidential rule 
in Prigorodnyy region because "it will do no good". He spoke 
against "the use of force, whoever might use it."

brought the republic on the brink of civil war", it says. 
  Leaders of the umbrella organization including the Tatar 
Public Center, Ittifak Party and Azatlyk Youth Movement are 
challenging the voting results because of what they saw as a ban 
on opposition meetings and rallies in the election campaign. 
The letter speaks of a government-sponsored campaign of 
intimidation and threats of dismissals and non-payment of wages 
in urban areas and withdrawal of subsidies in the countryside. 
  They accused the government of imposing censorship of the 
mass media and barring representatives of the nationalist groups 
from monitoring the election. 
  The authors of the letter say they have appealed for 
international inquiry into the legitimacy of federal elections 
in Tatarstan and an anti-democratic environment in which they 
were held.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Yuriy Vakhrin: "Choice Has Been </F>
Made But There Is Still No Agreement"] 
  [Text] Yaroslavl -- The Yaroslavl people have formed a new 
legislative organ with an imposing name: the Yaroslavl Oblast 
State Duma. The elections were deemed valid in 17 out of 23 
districts. That is, six deputies' seats will be empty for at 
least two months. But it is entirely possible they will be 
empty until the fall. The Duma deputies will now schedule the 
date of repeat elections. 
  No municipal organs of power were elected in the cities of 
Rostov and Rybinsk. The elections of the municipal committee in 
the oblast center were also almost disrupted: Here only 15 
deputies' seats acquired incumbents and in seven districts the 
voters essentially refused to use their legal "right to vote." 
  The voters' level of activeness has been very low. Only 33 
percent of people with the right to vote came to the polling 
stations. In two districts of Rybinsk and four of Yaroslavl, 
the number of those who went to the polls was lower than the 
control level of 25 percent. 
  In all 14 districts were formed on the territory of these 
large industrial centers. And in eight of them where elections 
were nonetheless valid a critical level of tension persisted 
until nearly the very last hour of work of the polling stations. 
Here the control level of voting activity was just exceeded. 
  The situation was saved by the inhabitants of the rural 
rayons. And not only because they are traditionally more 
responsive to appeals to take part in such campaigns. The 
inhabitants of villages and small towns were better informed 
about their candidates. 
  I personally, compelled by my job to read the entire local 
press from cover to cover and to listen to the local radio and 
watch oblast and city television programs, managed to learn the 
names of the contenders for a seat on the municipality only at 
the polling station, from the ballot slip itself. 
  It may be supposed that a substantial proportion of voters 
who wanted to vote did not want "improvisations" in front of the 
ballot box and preferred to stay home on Sunday. Others, 
although they did come, were unable to make a choice and marked 
the box "against all deputies." 
  Probably the Yaroslavl people's activity was influenced to 
some extent also by "political fatigue" and the general 
political situation in Russia recently. A serious analysis by 
specialists is needed here. Especially as the election 
situation in neighboring oblasts -- Ivanovo and Kostroma 
Oblasts, where the voting is scheduled for the second half of 
March -- is similar to the situation observed in Yaroslavl 
Oblast. There is the same growing decline in voters' interest 
in the elections, the same lack of information about the 
candidates. And -- particularly important -- the same old idea 
of the new organs of power. 
  At any rate, the majority of Yaroslavl people have obviously 
elected another soviet but not a legislative chamber of a fully 
empowered component of the Russian Federation. During a poll 
over 70 percent of respondents, for instance, unequivocally 
expressed themselves in favor of the idea that the new oblast 
Duma should work on the basis of voters' instructions. 
  At a press conference devoted to the results of the 
elections, Yaroslavl Oblast Governor Anatoliy Lisitsin frankly 
stated that their results could have been utterly different had 
it not been for the constant attacks of Vladimir Varukhin, the 
president's representative in the oblast, who sought to disrupt 
the elections. "During meetings with inhabitants I was often 
asked: Why go to the elections if the president's representative 
states that the elections will be repealed, that they will be 
moved to the fall. That of course affected people's mood and 
introduced confusion.... The voters' activeness could have been 
far higher had it not been for the negative role of the 
president's representative." 
  It is sad, but each disputing side has some truth. This 
became possible in the absence of precise, clear legislation on 
elections to the oblast legislative organs of power and 
self-management. The statute on elections in the oblast was 
reworked three times. For instance, the governor initially 
confirmed this statute io the basis of the "Penza option" 
guaranteeing representation in the Duma for each administrative 
formation irrespective of the number of inhabitants. 
  Defending it, he appealed to the Constitution, which gives 
components of the Federation the right to determine the election 
procedure independently. Threatening a court investigation, the 
president's representative achieved a change to this statute on 
the elections but in the name of safeguarding citizens' 
constitutional guarantees to equal electoral rights. 
  As a result the districts had to be re-formed in such a way 
that they contained an equal number of voters. This 
reorganization alone added to the confusion and disoriented both 
candidates and voters. 
  One side, for instance, suggested that the elections be 
deferred. The other would not agree to this for anything. The 
local "red directors" recently "clashed" strongly with the 
governor. They used threats and ultimatums to force him to 
lower local taxes, established by the previous oblast soviet. 
Nothing can now patch up this breach in the budget. That is 
why the governor categorically refused to remain any longer 
without his legislator partner, without his protection and 
support. 
  The president's administration tried to reconcile the 
quarrelling sides and to reason with them. N. Medvedev, leader 
of the administration's department for work with the 
territories, traveled to Yaroslavl. In vain. Three days before 
the elections, when everything was already prepared for the 
voting, the president's representative suddenly sent a 
representation to the governor (and published it in the press at 
the same time) suggesting that the elections to the local organs 
of power be cancelled. 
  The elections nonetheless took place. But the last Sunday in 
February brought no conciliation. The situation now is taking 
shape in such a way that a succession of court cases on 
recognizing the elections to the municipalities as invalid may 
now ensue in the oblast.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksey Tarasov: "Leaders with Access to </F>
Secrets"] 
  [Text] Krasnoyarsk -- Since the soviets of people's 
deputies have departed this life, the kray administration has 
been interested in lawmaking in Krasnoyarsk. But despite the 
passion with which officials have given themselves over to this 
task, they have not crowned themselves with laurels. The 
statute on elections to the kray legislative assembly scheduled 
for 27 March forbids the publication in the 10 days prior to the 
voting of the results of public opinion polls connected with the 
forthcoming elections. 
  We recall that this ban was in operation on the eve of the 
12 
December all-Russian parliamentary elections but led to nothing 
good. And now it is happening again. 
  Why the kray administration needed this is in general 
understandable: By receiving punctually sociological 
information which is closed to the press it will receive an 
opportunity to control the course of the election campaign where 
the rest of the public is assigned the role of extras. 
Officials will find it easier to make operational conclusions 
and to manipulate public consciousness. 
  The kray referendum is scheduled for 27 March: The 
population is to express its attitude toward the local law "on 
the foundations of direct power of the people and the 
organization of state power in Krasnoyarsk Kray." The 
interpretation of the power of the people and of democracy in 
this document gives rise to a mass of questions. 
  But let us return to the elections ceremony. Seven days 
before them the governor has also banned "the dissemination of 
materials detrimental to the honor and dignity of candidate 
deputies." What, in the remaining days -- before and after -- 
is it possible to cause harm? And what about the honor and 
dignity of other citizens who are not contenders for seats? 
  The local administration separately approved inter alia a 
statute on the procedure for the use of the mass media by 
candidate deputies which includes the following point for one: 
"Journalists, creative workers, and officials who commit 
violations may at the suggestion of the relevant electoral 
commission be removed for the period through the end of the 
election campaign from work connected with its coverage by the 
leaders of the mass media.... The electoral commission, in 
cases where mass media editorial offices violate the procedure 
for conducting election campaigning more than once, have the 
right to raise the question of the dismissal of leaders of mass 
media editorial offices...." 
  Under the law "on the mass media" this is called 
interference 
in the activity of editorial offices and violation of their 
professional independence (and the 10-day moratorium on the 
publication of sociological reports is forcing the journalists 
to renounce the dissemination of information). 
  It seems there is one thing left for the local press: not to 
fulfill illegal bans. Incidentally, KRASNOYARSKIY KOMSOMOLETS 
had the day before, 12 December, familiarized its readers with 
the data of sociological polls so the outcome of the elections 
was no sensation for them. 
  Incidentally, KRASNOYARSKIY KOMSOMOLETS because of financial 
difficulties was recently obliged to take on as a co-founder the 
kray administration's press and information department. But the 
new owner does not even have enough money for those who do not 
contradict it. 
  So far no demonstration against the restriction of freedom 
of 
speech in Krasnoyarsk has been observed. On the other hand, the 
triumphal procession of bureaucrats is continuing to talk of the 
establishment of a civil society and the separation of powers.

  [Text] [Announcer] A meeting between Ukraine's President 
Leonid Kravchuk and former U.S. President Richard Nixon is to 
take place soon. What does Leonid Kravchuk himself expect from 
this meeting? Volodymyr Tatarenko asked him to answer this 
question: 
  [Begin recording] [Kravchuk] The principal goal of the 
meeting is to involve private capital in Ukraine. We are 
setting such a goal while discussing this issue in the United 
States because we know that, and it seems to me that I had 
already said this at the news conference: No matter what credits 
are granted to us, unless private capital is invested in 
Ukraine, because it makes the bulk of the capital...[pauses] By 
the way, do you know how much the United States invests in 
foreign countries annually? Four hundred and fifty billion 
dollars. Can you imagine this? Half a trillion dollars are 
invested. But it is not the state that invests, but private 
firms. These are the Morgan, General Motors, Pepsi Cola, 
Johnson and Johnson, and so on and so forth. They have capital 
and they invest it. So, to involve them we here have to act 
relevantly adequately. That is to say, conditions, protection 
of [investments], and a market itself must be created. However, 
there should be promotion. 
  Therefore, the main goal of my meeting with vice president 
[title as heard] Mr. Nixon is to agree on how to involve private 
capital in Ukraine. This is the main thing. And to exchange 
opinions on the political situation. He has relevant 
instructions from relevant circles in the United States and he 
wants to draw his own conclusions proceeding from his own 
observations. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] And what if he meets the 
opposition leaders? 
  [Kravchuk] He is welcome to do this. I will not object to 
this. I will even propose this to him. Let him listen to the 
opposition leaders. I would only want him to ask them to show 
him their programs. Not just words, but programs. Because, 
there are quite a few amateurs whose hobby is to talk a lot. If 
he considers their programs and they are better and more 
effective, believe me, we will glorify our dear opposition.

  [Excerpt] As we have already reported, a session of the 
Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers began today. During a recess, 
President Leonid Kravchuk and government members toured the 
Kremenchug Association for Production of Trucks. Having viewed 
the models on display -- which included heavy tractors, new 
models of small and medium-sized cars, and microbuses -- Leonid 
Kravchuk answered questions from Ukrainian journalists: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] These trucks 
represent a technological priority for Ukraine. Is there any 
hope that we will drive this beautiful vehicle into the European 
market? 
  [Kravchuk] There are a lot of economic problems right now. 
There are still a lot of cry babies in Ukraine. However, there 
are people who, in difficult conditions -- I do not want to say 
that it is easy for them -- find ways to resolve such problems, 
which could not be found even in the time that is now being 
regretted by many. Here we have been shown model cars. If one 
wants, one will find ways to resolve the most difficult problems 
at the most difficult times. If one does not want, one will nod 
at somebody else. One can nod at the government, the president, 
a manager, and the administration -- there are many to nod at. 
However, this will not advance matters. Therefore, we are 
discussing a very important question at the Cabinet of Ministers 
today -- a program for restructuring industry. Without this, 
there will be no market, no development of our industry. We are 
to determine our goals, and what we have to help attain these 
goals -- resources, people, technologies, raw materials, etc., 
etc. If we implement this restructuring according to market 
principles or some other... [Kravchuk pauses] Today, it is 
clearly determined that this should be only the market. Of 
course, there should be state control over the transition to 
[passage indistinct]. 
  Market mechanisms work for everyone. A plant, its manager, 
and its administration work under market conditions; find 
contracts with foreign and domestic firms; work for Ukraine, for 
the realization of production both in Ukraine and abroad. I 
just want... [pauses] We have just seen, and invited you so 
that you can say to the people: Good people, stop crying and 
look for ways out of these problems. True, these problems are 
not the same in every branch; they are different. However, 
there are different ways of resolving them. We appeal; we 
simply believe that there is no other path for Ukraine -- one 
must look for ways out of our problems. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Yerevan March 15 TASS -- "The presence of the 
Russian border troops in the Transcaucasus on the basis of an 
agreement with Georgia and Armenia points to the recognition of 
Russia's strategic interests in this region," the Commander in 
Chief of the Russian Border Troops General Andrey Nikolayev said 
here today. 
  On behalf of the Russian president he signed an agreement on 
the enlistment and service of Armenian citizens in Russia's 
border troops stationed on the territory of this republic. 
  Russia and Armenia also signed bilateral protocol on the 
text 
of the oath to be taken when joining the Russian border troops. 
  Both the agreement and the protocol are of extremely great 
importance, General Nikolayev told ITAR-TASS. They practically 
complete a series of documents relating to the presence of 
Russian border troops on Armenian territory and on cooperation 
between the two countries in protecting the state border. 
  We have completed all steps connected with the preparation 
of 
the necessary legal basis, from the status of presence to the 
system of manning borderguard units and funding provisions for 
them, the general said. 
  General Nikolayev stressed the importance of this 
accomplishment for Russian border guards and Armenian citizens.

  [Text] Minsk March 15 TASS -- The Belarusian Supreme Soviet 
legislature passed on Tuesday a new constitution. 
  Under the new constitution, Belarus is to become a 
presidential republic. It is declared "a unitary democratic 
social law-governed state", with man regarded as the highest 
value of society and the state. 
  Belarus sets the goal of becoming a nuclear-free and neutral 
power. 
  The republic's president will also be the head of the 
executive branch. The parliament is to be reduced to 260 
deputies from the present 360 lawmakers. It will remain 
semi-professional, that is part of deputies will work full-time 
in the parliament's standing commissions, while the rest will 
combine their deputy's posts with some other jobs. 
  The parliament ruled that presidential elections should be 
called before this July, while elections to a new parliament are 
to be held not later than this year. 
  The new fundamental law of the Republic of Belarus is to 
come 
into force from the date of its publication.

  [Text] The Council of the Russian State Duma at a session 
on Monday dropped from the agenda of the lower house of 
parliament the question of the situation in Chechnya. This was 
reported to journalists by the head of a parliamentary group and 
State Minister for Nationalities Sergey Shakhray. 
  He said Communists, Liberal-Democrats, Democrats and the 
Agrarian Party voted against the debate as they felt the matter 
should be settled by the president himself. "These groups are 
either afraid of Dudayev, or of a controversy about the matter", 
Shakhray announced. 
  Shakhray came out with the initiative of discussing the 
matter in both houses of the Federal Assembly.

features of military service, the parties grant the right to 
servicemen and individuals released from military service and 
members of their families who move from the territory of one 
party to reside permanently on the territory of the other to 
take their belongings, including means of transport, without 
restriction and without the levying of duties, taxes or dues.

force units and airborne units of the parties' anti-aircraft 
defenses.

meet with calamity or lose their way, and stopping the hijacking 
or seizure of aircraft. 
<H6>  Article 14 </H6>
  Changes and additions to this treaty may be made on the 
initiative of either party on the basis of mutual agreement. 
<H6>  Article 15 </H6>
  This treaty is subject to ratification and will come into 
force on the day on which instruments of ratification are 
exchanged. 
  This treaty is valid for five years. The validity of the 
treaty will subsequently be extended automatically by a further 
year if, six months before the expiry of the relevant period, 
neither party notifies the other party in writing of its desire 
to end it. 
  This treaty applies provisionally as of the day on which it 
is signed. 
  Signed in the city of Moscow on 2 March 1994 in two copies,

  [Text] Moscow-Kiev -- Speaking to a UNIAN correspondent 
today, Russia's Ambassador-at-Large Yuriy Dubinin, who is 
heading the Russian state delegation at the negotiations on the 
Black Sea Fleet, refuted a Radio Liberty report which quoted him 
as saying that Russia has no intention of taking an inventory of 
the Black Sea Fleet, as well as a report by the same radio 
station on "Ukraine's reluctance to abide by last year's 
Massandra accords." Yuriy Dubinin refused to give his opinion 
on the fleet's inventory insisted on by the Ukrainian side but 
stressed that the issue is within the competence of the 
Ukrainian and Russian delegations. "Any attempts to turn the 
Black Sea Fleet negotiations into a shoot-out by unilateral and 
public statements will have little effect," he said. 
"Undoubtedly, [Ukrainian President] Leonid Kravchuk's proposals 
on the fleet will be discussed. The final date for a meeting 
between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations has not yet been 
set." 
  Speaking on the Black Sea Fleet issue, Ukraine's former 
defense minister, Kostyantyn Morozov, told UNIAN today that the 
sides must first fulfill their previous obligations. "The fleet 
must be divided by 1995, and its non-Ukrainian part must leave 
the territory of Ukraine, in which Russia can count on our 
assistance," Kostyantyn Morozov stressed. "I am convinced it 
would be unreasonable to drag this problem into the next 
century." He also emphasized the lack of grounds behind 
Moscow's allegations that Ukraine is not abiding by the 
Massandra accords. "We don't know any such accords. The 
Russian side means the verbal agreements between Presidents 
Leonid Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin which are not accords as such 
but merely a reflection of their common view on the negotiation 
process." The main premise in this process, the former minister 
believes, should be Ukraine's legislation and security.

  [Text] A news conference on the results of the Cabinet of 
Ministers sitting, chaired by Ukraine's President Leonid 
Kravchuk, was held on 14 March in Kiev. As was pointed out at 
the meeting with journalists, the consideration of the draft 
program of structural reorganization of Ukraine's economy was 
[word indistinct] at the sitting. Deputy Minister of Economy 
Leonid Minin stressed at the news conference that this document 
received, in general, a positive assessment at the sitting. It 
will be submitted for the consideration of the Supreme Council. 
It is a conceptual basis for Ukraine's transition toward market 
principles of economic management with social orientation and 
its integration into the world system of labor distribution with 
regard to the specific nature of our state's economic 
development. The draft envisages the urgent overcoming of 
emission and hyperinflation and measures to accelerate the 
privatization processes. 
  Also, a report by President Leonid Kravchuk on the results 
of 
the official visit by Ukraine's state delegation to Washington 
was heard at the sitting. Judging from the agreements achieved 
there, they managed to bring Ukrainian-American relations to a 
qualitatively new level. In particular, a large-scale program 
of economic and other cooperation between the two countries was 
mapped out. First and foremost, this is manifested in the fact 
that the United States is ready to grant 2.5 million dollars in 
aid for the implementation of about 70 specific projects.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 49; compiled </F>
by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk says that last Thursday's 
decree by Crimean leader Yuriy Meshkov to hold a poll on 
relations with Kiev "will not be legally binding regardless of 
the balance of forces." 
  For his part, Crimean Parliamentary Chairman Nikolay Bagrov 
defeated by Meshkov in presidential elections in January, in a 
speech in Sevastopol said that on a number of points the new 
president's first decrees were out of line both with Ukrainian 
and Crimean legislation. 
INTERFAX Note: Crimean deputies have not accepted Bagrov's 
resignation as parliamentary leader that he tendered after a 
crushing defeat in the presidential elections. 
  Bagrov said the Crimean president's decree sacking the 
cabinet included a number of officials who were not cabinet 
members, among them -- heads of the Ukrainian security services 
for the territory and of "Crimea" TV company. 
  Bagrov said it was not sensible to try to make 1994 a year 
of 
continued elections, pointing to a parliamentary resolution 
saying it was pointless to call local elections in Crimea on 
June 26 timed to coincide with a similar vote in Ukraine. 
Bagrov called for local elections to be held later in the year 
instead of this summer at the height of a harvesting and holiday 
season. 
  He praised the parliament's performance over the past four 
years saying "Crimean statehood was the main achievement" over 
the period. 
  However, Bagrov believes that on the negative side, the 
parliament has failed to set in motion a mechanism for an "open 
economy" in the territory. 
  But local observers think this is something that Russian 
economist Yevgeniy Saburov, appointed as vice premier last 
Friday, will be able to make progress in. Many point to the 
fact that Saburov's first steps as virtual head of government 
are clearly intended to ease tension in relations with Kiev. 
INTERFAX Note: Shortly after his appointment, Saburov appealed 
to the Ukrainian president to be granted Ukrainian citizenship. 
And at a news conference later, he spoke of wanting "to nudge 
Meshkov towards rapprochement with Kiev." Saburov said Crimea 
would maintain very close ties with Ukraine. He praised the 
professional skills of Ukrainian economics and finance ministers 
Roman Shpek and Grigoriy Pyatachenko describing them as "highly 
pragmatic." 
  At the same time, Saburov said the core of his cabinet would 
be made up of leading economists, to be invited from Russia, and 
whom he described as "highly competent professionals."

<F P=106> [Statement by Roman Koval, chairman of the national </F>
association "Ukraine's State Independence," and deputy editor of 
the newspaper NEZBORYMA NATSIYA (An Invincible Nation): 
"National Dictatorship Alone Will Extricate Us From Chaos"] 
  [Text] In the election campaign in Lvov Oblast, the 
national association "Ukraine's State Independence" [DSU] is 
represented by three candidates: Anatoliy Shcherbatyuk 
[presently under arrest for stirring up interethnic hostility], 
Myron Levytskyy, and Roman Koval. In Ukraine, mainly in its 
eastern [as published] regions, 23 DSU members are standing to 
be deputies. 
  The DSU's election program is expounded by its chairman 
Roman 
Koval, deputy editor of NEZBORYMA NATSIYA and author of the 
books "Is Appeasement Between Ukraine and Russia Possible?," 
"With Whom and Against Whom?," and "On Enemies, Allies, and 
Fellow-Travelers." 
  The DSU is in favor of immediately suspending the 
uncontrolled export of foodstuffs and basic commodities to 
Russia, Israel, and Poland. By closing Ukrainian borders, we 
will also arrest the filthy tide of Russian and Western 
pseudoculture (pornography, occultism, sectarianism, psychic 
shamanism, and drug addiction), as well as migration from 
Russia, Caucasus, and Third-World countries. 
  We are against the demo-communist Kravchuk-Zvyahilskyy 
clique, which has plundered Ukraine, imposed Western prices, 
given the green light to speculators, profiteers, and 
corruptionists, and sharply reduced social programs. 
  We do not trust the so-called democratic opposition, which 
humbly fulfills the instructions of the West. Nor do we trust 
the communists, who have always looked toward Moscow -- the 
capital of the Russian evil empire. 
  The DSU supports a decisive offensive, involving the army, 
against the mafia and it endorses the nationalization of 
property accumulated by it. 
  We find it necessary to introduce a state monopoly on 
external trade and major transactions involving hard currency. 
  We advocate the return to state price regulation and 
expropriation of the non-Ukrainian bourgeoisie, which got rich 
through violating the law and exploiting Ukrainians. 
  Land, factories, and other large enterprises must become 
state property. 
  The DSU is against the privatization of Ukraine by aliens. 
For this, it is necessary to adopt a new law on citizenship 
that would guarantee Ukrainians the right to be masters on their 
own land. In accordance with the current law on citizenship, 
the following categories of people have the right to elect and 
to be elected to the Supreme Council: 
  -- veterans of the anti-Ukrainian struggle, former NKVD 
[People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs], KGB, GRU [Main 
Intelligence Directorate], and Ministry of Internal Affairs 
officials who were involved in repressions against the Ukrainian 
people; 
  -- millions of Russians who were brought in to ultimately 
enslave Ukraine; 
  -- separatists of various nationalities; 
  -- criminal mafiosi who are undermining Ukraine's economy. 
  As one can see, the present law on citizenship fixes the 
domination in Ukraine of aliens -- Charodyeyevs, Meshcheryakovs, 
Zvyahilskyys, Hurvitses, and Dvorkises [officials of Russian and 
allegedly Jewish origin].... 
  Thus, the DSU is in favor of adopting a new law on 
citizenship, a law that will guarantee the right to vote 
exclusively to those citizens who are loyal to the Ukrainian 
state. 
  In order to enable us to survive as a nation, preference in 
our state must be given to all things Ukrainian: Ukrainians 
must be given employment on a priority basis, their social 
provision must be promoted, and they must be given cheap housing 
and privatization rights. In making personnel cuts, Ukrainians 
must be the last on the redundancies list. 
  Peasants will receive land for permanent use with the right 
for their children to inherit it, but without the right to sell 
it. The peasant himself will choose the form of economic 
management, but not the political line. Ukrainian peasants will 
be given every possible assistance. 
  It is necessary to increase expenditure on ensuring a proper 
standard of living for officers of the law-enforcement bodies, 
Ukraine's Security Service, and servicemen, and to stop the 
conversion of the military-industrial complex and unilateral 
disarmament. 
  We are against democratic chaos and communist practices and 
for a strong national administration and a mighty Ukrainian 
Army, equipped with nuclear weapons. 
  The members of the DSU will stand for the Supreme Council 
exclusively for the purpose of promoting the Ukrainian national 
idea -- we do not believe that the Ukrainian state can be built 
through voting. Moreover, we believe that elections are a 
wasteful and harmful affair: While we are preparing to vote, 
Russia is preparing war against us for the Crimea and then for 
the whole of Ukraine. 
  It is only a strong Ukrainian military power that can stop 
the Kremlin's adventurers. 
  The preconditions exist for introducing military 
dictatorship: These are chaos, the unpunished growth of 
separatism, the factual departure of the Crimea, Donetsk, and 
Luhansk oblasts from Kiev's jurisdiction, and the escalation of 
crime. 
  The Ukrainian military will come to power by methods that 
are 
traditional in world history. They will be the ones who will, 
within a short period of time, close the borders that will 
delineate our state. 
  Precisely the military will subdue the administrations of 
the 
Crimea and Donbass, which are rapidly moving away from Kiev. 
  Precisely they, through the mass media that they will 
censor, 
will shape public opinion, which will approve the decisive 
establishment of order in Ukraine. 
  The so-called democratization will be curtailed. A 
transitional period will be announced, during which the 
"Ukrainian SSR Constitution" will not be effective. 
  A moratorium will be introduced on elections, referendums, 
and plebiscites. 
  Those parties and other organizations that are financed from 
abroad will be disbanded. 
  Anti-Ukrainian publications will be closed down. 
  Rallies and picketing will be temporarily banned. 
  Newsprint will be nationalized. Private printing houses and 
duplicating equipment will be confiscated by the state. 
  An emergency situation in the economy will be declared. 
  Speculation, pornography, and prostitution will not be 
tolerated. Homosexuals, prostitutes, pimps, and people with no 
fixed abode will be isolated. 
  A psychological campaign will be waged against enemies of 
the 
Ukrainian people through the mass media. Those who continue 
their antistate activity will be isolated and those showing 
disloyalty will be deported. The necessary effect will be 
created through disbanding anti-Ukrainian formations and holding 
several blitz trials of separatists with harsh verdicts. 
  There is no alternative -- national dictatorship alone will 
extricate Ukraine from chaos and will lead it toward achieving 
statehood. 
  We believe in the revival of the Ukrainian people. We are 
looking forward to it. We are bringing it closer. Upheavals 
will inevitably occur -- we are at a historical turning point.

  [Text] [Announcer] As has already been reported, Latvian- 
Russian interstate talks resumed in Moscow today. Ritums 
Rozenbergs, Latvian Radio Moscow correspondent and the LABRIT 
newspaper, will tell us more. 
  [Rozenbergs] This morning, the Latvian and Russian 
delegations considered texts of the agreement. The delegations 
agreed that additional consultations were needed on certain 
issues. As a result of the meeting held this morning, both the 
Russian and Latvian sides hope that the social security issue 
for Russian military pensioners will be tackled. However, 
findings of banks' experts are needed in order to reach this 
agreement. So then, it is necessary to clarify the mechanism of 
the payment of pensions. 
  On the issue of the Skrunda military base the delegations 
decided at the morning meeting that the text of the agreement 
would be acceptable for both sides. The Russian delegation has 
not yet given final consent in connection with the fact that a 
rent payment of 400 million dollars a year, demanded by the 
Latvian side, is under question. The Latvian side expresses the 
wish that several agreements favorable to Latvia could be 
reached.

<F P=106> [Anastasiya Romashkevich, Denis Demkin article: "Andrey </F>
Kozyrev Talks. Youth and Experience Argued in the Far East 
About the Middle East"] 
  [Excerpts] The Vladivostok airport was the venue for 
yesterday's meeting between Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher. Their discussions had been expected 
to center on the Balkans. But recent events introduced some 
changes: The Kozyrev-Christopher meeting in the Far East was 
preceded by their urgent trips to the Middle East, thus the 
interlocutors paid considerable attention precisely to the 
problem of getting the Arab- Israeli talks back on track. 
According to an official version, the Vladivostok meeting is 
supposed to "have plastered over the cracks" that have run 
across the building of Russo-American relations. Despite the 
upbeat tone of the joint statement, more cracks may develop 
soon. [passage omitted] 
  The meeting in Vladivostok has revealed some differences -- 
this time around, those of the sides' approach to the Middle 
East settlement. The Russian Foreign Ministry head arrived for 
the meeting from the Middle East without calling at Smolenskaya 
Square [ministry's headquarters in Moscow]. The upshot of his 
talks with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat in Tunisia on Friday was the 
Palestinians' agreement in principle to return to the 
negotiating table. The Arabs, for that matter, demanded for 
themselves guarantees of security via an international presence 
on the Israel-occupied territories. Having backed the PLO's 
demands, Russia also thought that the talks could only be 
resumed after the Arabs and Israel agree on the question of 
guarantees. The United States spoke for an immediate resumption 
of the talks. Remarkably, its actions in recent days were 
emphatically independent from Moscow. On Sunday, Christopher 
stated that U.S. efforts to get the Palestinian-Israeli talks 
resumed were successful. He made this statement after, having 
been overcome with curiosity to know what Kozyrev had been 
talking about, he phoned Israeli Premier Rabin and 'Arafat on 
Saturday night. Already yesterday, U.S. Middle East settlement 
coordinator Dennis Ross arrived in Tunisia for urgent 
consultations with the PLO. Literally hours after, it was 
announced that an Israeli delegation was also leaving for 
Tunisia to join in the consultations. That is to say, there is 
an obvious rivalry in Middle East peacemaking between Moscow and 
Washington. [passage omitted] 
  Incidentally, local observers did not pass over the fact 
that 
the heads of diplomatic agencies did not meet in the local 
Negotiations House but at the airport -- and at the Americans' 
request. The formal reason was a banal shortage of time. 
According to rumors being whipped up in Vladivostok, however, 
Christopher had decided to respond to the hurt caused to 
ex-President Richard Nixon in Moscow.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovsiky, Edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] An exclusive interview granted by the Georgian 
leader to Interfax on his return from the United States. 
  Cor.: You have told the Georgian press that the aims of your 
visit to the United States have been achieved. To what extent 
does that apply to the Abkhazian conflict, and what part is 
Russia expected to play in the settlement of that conflict? 
  Eduard Shevardnadze: President Bill Clinton and I have 
reached mutual understanding on all principal issues, above all 
that of deploying an international peace-keeping force in 
Abkhazia. This is a difficult matter in practical terms. It 
poses two problems: First of all, the U.N. Security Council has 
to take a special decision to that effect, and, secondly, funds 
have to be raised for it. 
  The latter problem has practically been solved in the course 
of my visit to America. I have support in that matter both from 
the president himself and from appropriate quarters in the U.S. 
Congress. 
  This was followed by a meeting of the U.N. Security Council, 
but before that I had a meeting with U.N. Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, at which we gave detailed consideration to 
all the problems the Abkhazian conflict involves. At the 
Security Council meeting, I spoke about what had happened in 
Abkhazia, about the causes and consequences of those events and 
about the present-day situation there. I gave all things their 
proper names. 
  The representatives of Russia, the United States, Britain, 
China, France and other Security Council member states expressed 
full support for Georgia's policy to settle the conflict. They 
stressed the need to preserve the territorial integrity and 
sovereignty of Georgia. 
  The proposal to urgently send an international peace-keeping 
force to Abkhazia was supported by practically all members of 
the Security Council. 
  There's something I'd like to make a special mention of 
here. 
Abkhazian separatist leader Vladislav Ardzinba tried to get to 
the rostrum of the Security Council in those days. They banned 
him from it, because he is not the head of a sovereign state. 
Then he gave a news conference at which, some journalists said, 
he was giving unintelligible answers and sounded fairly 
unconvincing altogether. He said there, for example, that 
bringing a peace-keeping force into Abkhazia would mean its 
occupation. I said in the United States that if that is 
occupation all of us should move to another planet. 
  As for the degree of Russia's participation in that really 
important process, it is certainly vast. What in fact is 
happening is coordinated joint action. 
  May I just remind that, before I went to the United States, 
President Boris Yeltsin came to Tbilisi and we signed the Treaty 
on Friendship, Good-Neighborly Relations and Cooperation. After 
that, the Georgian parliament ratified the documents formalizing 
our country's membership in the CIS. So after much effort we 
came round to seeing the need for consecutive cooperation within 
the Commonwealth to establish lasting peace in Georgia, and 
consequently in the entire Caucasus, which is in the vital 
interest of Russia as well. 
  It is the principle of Georgia that it is wrong today to 
divide the planet into "our own" and "somebody else's" regions. 
It is the duty of humankind to take to heart any problem that 
can become a source of a great tragedy no matter where such a 
problem arises. 
  The democratic forces in all countries which value democracy 
and constructive cooperation should come together. As we get 
rid of the consequences of the Cold War and internal conflicts, 
it must be one of our priorities to unite in fighting 
reactionary and conservative forces, wherever they rear their 
heads. It seems to me that a U.N. Security Council decision to 
deploy a peace-keeping force in Abkhazia would be an essential, 
and possibly the principal contribution to the breaking of the 
"Abkhazian deadlock," and hence to the elimination of one of the 
sources of danger. The voting on a resolution to that effect 
will be preceded by a speech that Butrus- Ghali is due to make 
at the meeting of March 21. The main point is that such a step 
should be taken under the aegis of the United Nations. This is 
today the most fair solution possible. 
  Corr.: What do you think of the Georgian parliament's 
decision declaring the Abkhazian parliament an illegal body? 
  E.S.: I think that was a rather rash step to take, and 
possibly not very justified in tactical terms. But essentially 
it does not contradict the political situation in general. 
  Corr.: What decisions do you expect to be made by the 
forthcoming congress of the Union of Citizens of Georgia of 
which you are the head? 
  E.S.: In brief terms, the aim of that organization is to 
help stabilize the situation in the country, make the democratic 
reforms irreversible, increase the influence in society of those 
forces which are absolutely consistent in their determination to 
lead Georgia out of its economic crisis, and put an end to all 
forms of crime. 
  The decisions of the congress will help solve our most 
serious problems.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abdollah Nuri, member of Tajikistan's </F>
Islamic movement, with an unidentified JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI 
correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Please give us a brief 
biography and speak about your Islamic activities. 
  [Nuri] In the name of God, the almighty and merciful. I am 
'Abdollah Nuri and am 46 years old. I was born in Tajikistan's 
mountainous region during the communist rule and at the peak of 
atheistic and communist propaganda. [passage omitted] 
  Since my father was acquainted with Islam, he started to 
teach religion to his children. At that time, the KGB put 
pressure on the Muslims. But despite all these pressures, we 
learned Islamic teachings and ideology from our father. I 
continued my studies in Dushanbe with a learned scholar, Qari 
Mohammad Jan, who had been in Afghanistan and India. [passage 
omitted] 
  In 1971, I was officially summoned by the KGB for the first 
time and was threatened because of my educational activities. 
Again in 1973 I was arrested by the KGB in the basement of a 
house in Dushanbe where we held secret classes. But fortunately 
our teacher, Qari Mohammad Jan, was not present at that time. 
However, all the students who were in the classroom were 
arrested. The KGB intended to send us to prison and then to 
exile us to Siberia. But we bribed them and were released. 
  Then pressures on us and on our father started and we were 
unable to continue our studies in Dushanbe. Therefore, we went 
to Forqan Tappeh which was our home and continued our lessons in 
night classes. It was in the same year that liberation 
movements were initiated by me and since we were under extreme 
pressure, we sought solutions so that we would be free to 
practice our religion and to carry out our Islamic duties. With 
God's help, we received books from abroad which offered us 
solutions to our problems. [passage omitted] 
  With the help of these books and Koranic teachings we 
reached 
the conclusion that the Islamic movement should be in the form 
of an organization, and that the numerous Islamic forces inside 
Tajikistan should be consolidated and work under the supervision 
of a group and a movement to vindicate our rights and to 
propagandize Islamic ideas among the youths who had been 
distracted from Islam by the communists. For this reason, we 
formed this group and continued our struggles. [passage omitted] 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Since then what have the activities of 
this movement been? 
  [Nuri] [Passage omitted] The revolution in Afghanistan was 
an 
impetus to our movement. But the basis of our movement was the 
victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran in which all the 
forces in the movement and all the Muslims in Tajikistan 
trusted. After the Islamic revolution in Iran, these forces 
were convinced that when Islam was able to prevail in Iran, the 
same could happen in other countries too. This gave the people 
self-confidence. [passage omitted] 
  We were able to achieve the official recognition of the 
Islamic Movement Party in Tajikistan. Following this 
recognition, the movement was led by Hemmatzadeh. Our first 
newspaper was HAQIQAT-E ESLAMI [Islamic Truth], the publication 
of which led to the arrest of more than 24 of the Islamic 
Movement's members. Later on a magazine called HEDAYAT 
[Guidance] was published. After the official recognition of our 
movement, the Islamic Movement Party started the publication of 
another newspaper called NEJAT [Salvation]. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Apart from publications, what other 
activities did the Islamic Movement have? 
  [Nuri] Among the activities of the Islamic Movement was its 
calls on youths to turn to Islam and the formation of meetings 
and gatherings for the people. [passage omitted] 
  We also established a school with the people's help in order 
to offer Islamic teaching to our Muslim children. [passage 
omitted]

  [Editorial Report] Russian Television Network in Russian at 
1725 GMT on 14 March carries its 10-minute "Details" program, 
presented by Sergey Dorenko. The program is devoted to former 
President Nixon's visit to Moscow. 
  Dorenko says it was intimated to Nixon that he could not see 
Yeltsin because Yeltsin was busy. He adds that Yeltsin himself 
spoke of this prior to his departure for a two-week vacation in 
Sochi. Yeltsin is then shown being interviewed at the airport. 
He says: "My leave simply means that my work routine is 
altered somewhat. Of course you are able to have walks, to go 
for strolls, to have a rest, but, at the same time, you are also 
able to work. 
  "All the same, I am in control of the situation; I mean the 
position and the state of affairs in the whole of Russia. I 
monitor it constantly, as it were, not just every day, but 
several times a day. Relevant leaders report to me and that is 
why if anything comes up, I will fly back forthwith. However, 
it is not currently thought that any upsets might materialize 
and that is why I am flying in a rather calm mood. 
  "As for my work -- yes, all the time I work on something 
serious for the future. Currently the work is this: the 
mechanism of the implementation of the presidential address to 
the Federal Assembly; that is to say, the address is one thing, 
but the matter of its implementation point by point, especially 
where the statehood dimension is concerned, and so on, and so 
on, and so forth, well, there must be a schedule for this, as 
you would have for a monthly day-by-day plan of action, as it 
were."

<F P=106> [Correspondent Viktor Metchikov report under "Regional </F>
Elections" rubric: "Lipetsk Boycotts Elections"] 
  [Text] Lipetsk -- A total of only 19 deputies in 38 
districts were elected to Lipetsk Oblast Deputies' Assembly in 
the elections held last Sunday [13 March]. Although the 
elections have been officially declared valid because the 
statute on this organ of representative power adopted by the 
oblast soviet enables it to start work with any quorum, the 
assembly's viability with only half its members seems extremely 
doubtful. 
  Even in rural districts the voter turnout has sharply 
decreased. As regards the city, it can be said that Lipetsk 
boycotted the elections en masse. Because of the low turnout of 
city inhabitants at polling stations (between 11 and 24 
percent), they were not valid in a single one of the oblast 
center's districts. Not a single deputy was elected to the city 
organ of representative power.

  [Text] Kiev, 15 Mar -- At a joint conference of defense 
ministers and ministers of foreign affairs of CIS countries, 
which will begin tomorrow [16 March] in the Russian capital, 
officials will search for an agreement in creating a system of 
collective security on the territory of the former USSR. Mr. 
Krzhanitskiy, Ukraine's ambassador to Russia, will represent 
Ukraine, which is participating in the conference as an observer. 
  As Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported, our state 
is not taking part in creating, and will not join the system of 
collective security. Ukraine's position is caused by its 
legislation: 
  It does not join military and political unions, blocs, or 
groupings. It was stressed during the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs' briefing that the creation of a system of security 
parallel to NATO is dangerous and inexpedient. Ukraine is in 
favor of global collective security on the territory of Europe.

  [Text] The Commonwealth of Independent States is becoming 
more independent and active, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev said in Moscow Wednesday, opening the meeting of the CIS 
Council of Foreign Ministers. 
  He believes the meeting's agenda reflects this tendency by 
including all key issues ranging from the protection of human 
rights to the protection of borders, more efficient 
peace-keeping operations and the prevention of regional 
conflicts. "Clearly, none of us will solve these problems. We 
should do so only within the framework of the Community on the 
basis of equality and mutual respect," he said. 
  Kozyrev believes that there is no need to speak about the 
international recognition of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States. "We need no international recognition. It is enough to 
have the decision of our presidents and parliaments for the CIS 
to work on and occupy a worthy place in the world. We should 
only speak about the development of CIS contacts with other 
international structures," he said. 
  At the meeting CIS foreign ministers plan to discuss the 
draft convention on the protection of the rights of national, 
ethnic, and religious minorities and the possible creation of a 
standing consultative commission for peacekeeping activities 
under the CIS Council of Foreign Ministers, diplomatic sources 
have told Interfax. 
  The Ministers intend to coordinate a plan of multilateral 
inter-ministry consultations within the CIS framework for 1994. 
They are also to discuss a CIS-CSCE cooperation. 
  The Ministers will have their say on the NATO program 
"Partnership for Peace." 
  In addition, the issue of talks between Russia and the 
Caucasian and Central Asian states on cooperation with the third 
countries on the protection of borders. 
  The Ministers will discuss Kazakhstan's proposal on a 
special 
session of the UN General Assembly on problems of the 
post-confrontation age. 
  Also to be discussed are the steps for the division of 
civilian sea vessels of the ex-Soviet Union between the CIS 
countries and the Baltic states.

  [Text] Moscow March 16 TASS -- "The Commonwealth of 
Independent States is acquiring a new quality. Today's agenda 
reflects this trend," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
said in his opening address at the meeting of CIS foreign 
ministers in Moscow today. 
  The forum is being attended by delegations from all 12 
countries of the Commonwealth, including foreign ministers of 
Russia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan. Other 
countries are represented by ambassadors and deputy foreign 
ministers. 
  Georgian Foreign Minister Aleksandr Chikvaidze told 
ITAR-TASS 
that a Georgian delegation was taking part in a meeting such as 
this for the first time, but as a new member of the CIS, Georgia 
"will try to make its modest contribution to the strengthening 
of the Commonwealth". 
  Ukrainian Ambassador Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy told ITAR-TASS 
that "We have certain considerations concerning the documents 
examined at the forum, particularly the document on the rights 
of ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. We do not 
understand what a linguistic minority means. In our republic 
there are ethnic minorities -- Russians and Poles. Ukraine is 
doing everything in its power for them not to feel that their 
rights are infringed upon."

  [Text] Dushanbe March 15 TASS -- A meeting of foreign 
ministers from Central Asia, Kazakhstan and the Russian 
Federation ended here today after adopting a final communique. 
  The communique supported an appeal of Tajik leader Emomali 
Rakhmonov to the president of the United Nations Security 
Council for giving the peace-making forces stationed in 
Tajikistan the status of a U.N. operation. 
  The document expressed profound alarm with the on-going 
tension on The Tajik-Afghan border, which destabilizes the Tajik 
situation and hampers settlement of the inter-Tajik conflict. 
  The meeting supported efforts taken by the Tajik leadership 
to achieve a political settlement and expressed the hope the 
negotiations will stop armed actions on the Tajik-Afghan border. 
The communique praised Russian and U.N. attention given to the 
Tajik problem with the aim of the soonest inter-Tajik settlement 
through a political dialogue. 
  It expressed the hope the parties to the conflict will find 
a 
political way to achieve national accord and civic peace and 
confirmed the readiness of Central Asian republics and Russia to 
help progress in development of inter-state relations. 
  After a brief trip to the Tajik-Afghan border, Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev had a tete-a-tete meeting with 
Tajik leader Emomali Rakhmonov to discuss the border situation 
and the need for border reinforcement, including that with 
personnel. 
  The Tajik leader assured the diplomat the Tajik Government 
will soon send 5,000 draftees to the border in the near future. 
  The sides also discussed the Tajik situation and the need 
for 
accelerated political dialogue with the opposition. The sides 
agreed that negotiations with the opposition to start in the 
immediate future will help a lot.

  [Text] Russia has concluded an agreement with the Baltic 
countries on supplying gas in 1994 on mutually advantageous 
conditions. Lentransgas Director General Radionov announced 
this to journalists today. He was a member of the delegation 
from the Rossiyskiy Gaz joint-stock company which has just 
completed a trip to the Baltics. As its participants noted, the 
disagreements which arose last year between Russia on the one 
hand and Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia on the other because of 
irregular payments for gas consumption have completely 
disappeared. Having received credits from the West, the Baltic 
countries have covered all their debts. Lithuania is the 
exception and has undertaken to remit $5 million by 15 March. 
The price of gas is set according to average European prices, 
which is about $80 per thousand cubic meters. 
  The agreement on gas supplies which has been signed means a 
significant influx of hard curency to the budgets of St. 
Petersburg and the oblast, over the territory of which the gas 
is transported to the Baltic.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 16 TASS -- NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the 
situation in Tajikistan: 
  "The situation has now radically changed: Moscow has managed 
to do what seemed impossible only recently -- to persuade the 
present Dushanbe authorities and the opposition into sitting 
down at the negotiating table". 
  "Moscow's rather rigid stand in the reassessment of events 
in 
Tajikistan by the leader of the regional superpower, Islam 
Karimov, make it possible to hope that at the forthcoming talks 
the conflicting sides will reach some kind of compromise: If 
moscow succeeds in achieving success, that will be a major 
triumph of Russian diplomacy". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article by Umerserik Kasenov, 
director of the Institute of Strategic Studies to the President 
of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Kosenov points out: "The process 
of the formation and development of newly-independent states is 
now under way in Central Asia in difficult conditions. Much in 
this process undoubtedly depends on Russia which keeps hold of 
powerful economic, political and military levers for influencing 
the situation in the Central Asian region... 
  "Unfortunately, Russia's foreign-policy course with regard 
to 
the ex-Soviet republics, including Central Asian ones, 
increasingly indicates that it pursues a divide-and-rule policy". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict: 
  "Vladislav Ardzinba availed himself of the ground provided 
by 
the Georgian parliament to announce the termination of political 
talks between Georgia and Abkhazia until the decision to 
dissolve the Abkhazian parliament and to institute judicial 
proceedings against its members is cancelled. 
  "Despite the fact that the dispute, it would seem, is a 
formal legal one and concerns the situation which preceded the 
start of the armed conflict, the Georgian parliament's 
resolution really interrupted the contradictory as it was 
dialogue which has been conducted until now between 
representatives of the two conflicting sides". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries an interview with Ramiz Razayev, 
plenipotentiary representative of the Republic of Azerbaijan to 
Russia, who points out: 
  "As far as Russia's role in a peaceful settlement of the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict is concerned, one should proceed 
from the assumption that Russia's geopolitical and economic 
interests are in need of stability on its southern borders... 
Therefore, we regard Russia's active participation in 
settlement efforts and the country's unprejudiced stand as major 
factors leading to a resolution of this complex problem". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI runs an interview with Mikhail Mironov, 
chief of the mail department of the presidential staff. He said 
that up to 1,500 letters addressed to the country's president 
come in every day and deal with a broad spectrum of problems 
while the department has 100 staff members. 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA referring to an informed staff member 
of 
the central office of the Russian Federal Counter-Intelligence 
Service (FCS) asserts that "the presidential administration is 
studying as one of reorganisation options the possibility of 
dividing the FCS with a transfer of its functions to other 
bodies. 
  "The FCS counter-intelligence operations directorate is 
expected, in particular, to be turned over to the Ministry of 
Justice and to be transformed into a federal investigation 
directorate. 
  "The economic counter-intelligence directorate and 
directorate for the security of strategically important 
industrial facilities is suggested to be subordinated to the 
Ministry of Economics while the military counterintelligence 
will be brought under the authority of the General Staff as an 
independent directorate. 
  "The anti-terrorism directorate is expected to be brought 
within the competence of the Interior Ministry. The idea of 
dividing the FCS is authored by one of the members of the 
Russian Security Council... 
  "FCS Chief Sergey Stepashin said he will have a meeting with 
the Russian president soon. He did not refute the information 
that proposals to reorganise the FCS and transfer its powers to 
other agencies come in to Boris Yeltsin. 
  "If the proposals are implemented, a serious blow will be 
dealt to security agencies. I categorically object to it and I 
oppose those who make such proposals. One should ponder what 
for they do that. I am deeply convinced that Russia and the 
president need strong secret services. I will uphold this 
thesis during a meeting with Yeltsin," Stepashin said. 
  NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA (NEW DAILY NEWSPAPER) Carries 
an interview with Major-General Yuriy Drozdov, former chief of 
illegals' counterintelligence. He expressed regret that the 
Vympel special-purpose unit has broken up. He regarded with 
understanding the Vympel officers who did not opt to serve on 
the payroll of the Interior Ministry. 
  "I do not censure them. They were prepared to uphold the 
interests of the native land and their people from an outside 
foe and outside their country. The sense of devotion to their 
people, the duty and honour of the intelligence officer did not 
allow them to act otherwise". 
  The general referred to the break-up of the unit as "the 
worst thing that could happen". He is convinced that such a 
unit is necessary for the country now as well, emphasising that 
a special- purpose unit, whose officers did not know what the 
word 'impossible' meant, has ceased to exist. 
  In PRAVDA, prominent film director Stanislav Govorukhin said 
on the same subject: 
  "the October events showed: the Ministry of Security will 
not 
carry out criminal orders and will not act against their people. 
To my mind, it has already become a commonly known fact how 
worthily the ministry's units Alpha and Vympel behaved in those 
days. 
  "I want to draw the readers' particular attention to the 
following circumstance: the Security Ministry was disbanded at a 
time when it almost entirely switched over to action against 
economic crime which inflicts the greatest damage on the state". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) runs an interview with 
Colonel-General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian Armed 
Forces' General Staff, who said that the operational structure 
of troops has been basically broken up following the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union. 
  "We have lost territory and, accordingly, the strategic 
echelon, while the reserve forces constitute the core of the 
first operational echelon. It was needed to create groups of 
troops throughout the western and southwestern sectors 
practically anew". 
  Kolesnikov said the complexity was in the fact that units 
subject to withdrawal had to settle in places which lacked the 
necessary infrastructure. "This was taking place during the 
period of the development and reforming of the Armed Forces with 
an acute shortage of material resources and funds", Kolesnikov 
said. 
  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Mikhail 
Poltoranin, chairman of the State Duma committee on information 
policy and communications, who suggests that the powers of the 
president and parliament be extended until 1998. 
  Poltoranin touched upon the problem of drawing up a 
memorandum of civil accord. His opinion is that such a document 
should be backed up by deeds without fail. "Let it be a small 
memorandum with clear-cut declarations but it should be 
supplemented without fail with a treaty on coordinated actions 
of the authorities, specific actions with a specific time-frame." 
  ST. PETERSBURG GAZETTE reports that the Ivangorod mayor's 
office has reinstated a voluntary public order maintenance 
squad. The newspaper points out that every member of the public 
order squad will be paid for every hour on duty from the funds 
of the city department of internal affairs while the maintenance 
of the chief of staff of the squad has been assumed by the 
mayor's office.

  [Text] On 15 March, the Belarusian Supreme Soviet adopted 
the new Belarusian Constitution with 236 "yes" votes, six "no" 
votes, and eight abstentions. The major innovation of the 
Constitution is that the presidential form of governing is 
outlined. It is expected that the election of the first 
Belarusian president will take place on 26 June 1994. The final 
"touch" added by the Supreme Soviet was an amendment to Article 
49 of the Constitution, which guarantees broad and free access 
to secondary and vocational education in the Republic. The new 
Constitution will come into force immediately after it is 
published in the Belarusian press.

<F P=106> [Report by Ihar Sinyakevich: "Mechyslaw Hryb: `We Can Hold </F>
Presidential Elections on 26 June'"] 
  [Text] "We can hold the presidential election on 26 June," 
stated the parliament speaker at a meeting with the Zhlobin 
metallurgical plant staff on 10 March. The main part of 
Mechyslaw Hryb's speech was devoted to his opinions on 
constitutional reform. The Supreme Soviet chairman noted that 
152 articles of the Constitution have already been adopted, and 
now, the parliament has to adopt the Constitution as a whole, as 
well as legislation on implementing it. In the opinion of the 
speaker, draft legislation on presidential elections and 
amendments to the law on Supreme Soviet elections should be 
examined after the Constitution is adopted. 
  "If the Constitution is passed, we can hold presidential 
elections on 26 June," Mechyslaw Hryb said. He also assured 
that "there will be many candidates," but did not reveal any 
specific names. 
  In the speaker's opinion, other ways of reforming the 
authorities are inadmissible, since the Republic could end up 
without any leadership. Mechyslaw Hryb also stated that he 
opposes the idea of dismissing the current government and 
establishing a coalition government of people's accord. In his 
opinion, "the government should protect the interests of 
grass-roots society." Mechyslaw Hryb admitted that the 
Communist Party is the largest party in the Republic. 
  The Supreme Soviet chairman pointed out that the current 
economic crisis can be overcome by signing an agreement with 
Russia on economic union and ruble zone. According to him, this 
will allow for an equalization of prices for energy resources in 
Belarus and Russia, which will make it possible for Belarusian 
producers to compete with Russia on a parity basis. Mechyslaw 
Hryb argued that it would be better if Russia did not lower 
prices for energy sources for Belarus to the internal Russian 
level, but on the contrary, raised prices for its consumers, 
since one day it will be necessary to adjust those prices to the 
world level anyway. 
  According to Mechyslaw Hryb, Belarusian industrialists are 
tired of the uncertainty over the unification of monetary 
systems. The speaker had met with directors of Minsk factories 
on the eve of his visit to Zhlobin, and they demanded that the 
final decision on the unification be made by the end of March. 
  Mechyslaw Hryb said that Russian experts have put forward 
new 
conditions for unifying the Belarusian and Russian monetary 
systems: To establish a common budget, to close the National 
Bank of Belarus, and to open a branch of the Central Bank of 
Russia in Minsk. In the speaker's opinion, these proposals 
"question the sovereignty of our people and our country." 
  The Supreme Soviet chairman suggested that if Russia refuses 
to establish the ruble zone, new ways will have to be found. In 
the opinion of Mechyslaw Hryb, the economic union could be 
established gradually. Abolishment of customs barriers could 
become the first step in this direction. 
  The speaker indicated that the economic situation is being 
complicated by the fact that profitable enterprises are actually 
financing loss-making factories. As Mechyslaw Hryb believes, it 
would be better to close those factories, and pay people until 
they find another job. 
  Responding to questions from workers', Mechyslaw Hryb said 
that it is possible to use the Interior Ministry Troops for 
patrolling streets to protect people against crime. 
  One of the workers asked the speaker about his opinion on 
the 
statement made by [former Supreme Soviet Chairman] Stanislaw 
Shushkevich in an interview with the Mir television company, in 
which the latter had claimed that the government is leading the 
Republic toward a dead end, and that the ruble zone will give us 
nothing. "If the ruble union is not concluded, strikes will 
wipe out the Kebich government," the worker said. Hryb replied 
that nobody had prevented Shushkevich from coming forward with 
proposals when the latter had been in power, but he, however, 
had supported the ruble zone at that time. 
  In general, the itinerary of Mechyslaw Hryb's working visit 
was the same as the same trip made last year by Stanislaw 
Shushkevich. After the Zhlobin metallurgical plant, the speaker 
visited the Klimavichy rayon center in Mahilyow Oblast. There, 
he inspected a cement plant, polyclinic, kindergarten, dairy, 
and the Muravelle settlement, where he met and spoke with people 
resettled from Chernobyl. The Supreme Soviet chairman was 
accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister Stanislaw Bryl and the 
leadership of Homel and Mahilyow Oblasts.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Chisinau, 14 Mar -- The Agrarian Democratic Party of 
Moldova, headed by Petru Lucinschi, won a convincing victory in 
the first parliamentary elections held in the country on a 
multiparty basis. Lucinschi's party received 43.18 percent of 
the votes, Nicolae Timofti, the chairman of the Central 
Electoral Commission, told a news conference here today. 
  After the Agrarian Democratic Party comes the Socialist 
Party 
and the Yedinstvo Intermovement bloc supported by the Russian 
speaking- population, which received the votes of 22 percent of 
the electorate. 
  Parties calling for unification with Romania -- the 
Christian 
Democratic People's Front [7.5 percent of the votes] and the 
Intelligentsia and Peasants bloc, headed by Former Parliamentary 
Speaker Aleksandru Mosanu, that broke away from it [9.21 
percent] were defeated. The remaining nine parties and 20 
independent candidates were unable to cross the four percent 
barrier and did not get into the new parliament. Their votes 
will be divided up among the winners. 
  Thus, the Agrarian Democratic party receives 56 of the 104 
seats in the new parliament and can form the new government 
independently. 
  There will be two political camps poles apart: Those who 
favor independence and Moldova's participation in the CIS (84 
mandates) and the unionist minority (20 mandates). 
  It is expected that Petru Lucinschi will be the new speaker, 
and current Prime Minister Andrey Sangheli will be instructed to 
form the government. It is also likely that deputies will 
ratify the CIS agreements signed by Mircea Snegur, and will 
begin talks on settling the conflicts with Komrat and Tiraspol 
[breakaway Gagauz and Dniester Republics respectively]. 
  In the opinion of observers from the UN, the CSCE, NATO, and 
a number of states, the elections in Moldova were well-organized 
and democratic.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Fedorova: "A Number of Questions After the </F>
Poll"] 
  [Text] The sociological survey, on which the agrarians 
insisted so much, has taken place and, as expected, it has 
confirmed the policy being conducted by the leadership of the 
Republic, which aimed at strengthening its independence. 
  In spite of the fact that only one question was asked, given 
its sphere of influence, it embraced the most important problems 
facing the state. The first thing to be clarified was how the 
population viewed the status of the Republic remaining what it 
was before. Those favoring the idea of unification with Romania 
had no choice but to give a negative response. The Republic's 
inhabitants also had to confirm its unity and territorial 
integrity within the framework recognized by the United Nations. 
This part established in general the permissible limit beyond 
which there should be no more talk about the status of the two 
regions -- the Gaugaz south and the Dneister region. The answer 
"yes" in this connection signifies the following: The forms of 
autonomies or other types of formations for the eastern and 
southern regions can be of any kind provided the principle of 
the unity and territorial integrity of Moldova is observed. 
  One other detail: In asking citizens whether they agree that 
Moldova should develop ties with any states, the authors of the 
poll were, to all intents and purposes, preparing the ground for 
the ratification by parliament of the CIS agreement. As is 
known, a year ago, in spite of the support of the majority, this 
question was blocked by the small Popular Front faction. This 
was an awkward moment and it was soon followed by the decision 
of the legislative assembly to dissolve itself. 
  Judging from the results of the elections, two-thirds of the 
new corps of deputies is united. At least regarding important 
decisions, one can count on the unity of views of the healthy 
rational majority. The poll that was carried out represents 
that reference point from which this majority can proceed, 
adopting laws that will subsequently form the basis of the new 
constitution. 
  The Gagauz again demonstrated the greatest activity. This is 
not surprising given that the poll focused on the future status 
of Moldova. Moreover, the results of the elections and the 
discarded slogans about unity radically changed the attitude of 
the native inhabitants of Moldova to the possibility of the 
Republic moving beyond the Prut River. There was also a change 
in attitude toward such a concept as the unity of one Romanian 
nation. With the arrival in power of the Agrarian Democratic 
Party, the basic principles of its program have essentially been 
established in the republic. Moldova is an independent state, 
the people living there are called Moldovans, and the state 
language is Moldovan. In principle, this was first sounded at 
the official level at the general civil congress "Our Home: The 
Republic of Moldova." 
  Disassociating itself from the idea of unification with 
Romania, the Republic's leadership came under sharp and negative 
criticism from the Bucharest press and Romania's political 
parties. True, according to M. Snegur, official Bucharest 
silently ignored the change in Moldova's political course. The 
Moldovan intelligentsia reacted to the criticism by lodging an 
official protest with the United Nations. In the letter signed 
by a group of scientists and cultural figures, it was pointed 
out: "Resolute condemnation of the insulting, even aggressive 
attitude of one UN member -- Romania -- toward another UN member 
-- the Republic of Moldova -- forms the essence of the protest." 
It is pointed out in the document that "the idea is alive in 
Moldova -- and is growing every day -- of the restoration of the 
unity of the Moldovan ethnic group and the status quo of the 
Moldovan principality" within its old historical borders. 
  Therefore, the poll as well as the results of the 
parliamentary elections are a platform for radical changes in 
Moldova. Having brought to an end discussions on possible 
unification with Romania, the Republic's leadership and its 
leading political parties will try to resolve one of the main 
problems -- the consolidation of the state and the achievement 
of civic accord in society. Therefore, as the president 
promised, one of the first bills to appear on the agenda of the 
first session [of parliament] will be that regulating relations 
between Chisinau and Comrat. Work will begin on elaborating the 
status of the eastern regions. Following the implementation of 
these documents, it will be possible to tackle the issues of the 
reestablishment of a single budget and a single monetary unit. 
  It is difficult to forecast in what way and in what form the 
status promised to the Dneister region will be conferred. 
However, if one takes into account that the recommendations of 
the CSCE will form the basis of the agreement pertaining to this 
question, one can suppose that, at a specific stage in the 
negotiations, the sides will tackle the federative formula for 
the construction of the state. Although, today, the Republic's 
leadership, while offering the eastern region wide powers, 
including even the existence of its own legislative assembly, is 
trying to avoid any forms of an autonomous political formation 
that, in time, would lay claim to its joining Moldova as part of 
a federation. 
  The authorities in Tiraspol, while welcoming the appearance 
of the agrarians at the political summit, are nevertheless in no 
hurry to announce any possible concessions on their part. In a 
statement issued by the Tiraspol press service, it is pointed 
out that, as the overwhelming majority of the inhabitants of the 
left bank did not participate in the parliamentary elections and 
also distanced themselves from the nation-wide poll, this can be 
assessed as support on the part of the population for the idea 
of independent statehood in the region. 
  The Republic's leadership is hoping to find a common 
language 
with Tiraspol with the help of Russia, which recognizes the 
independence of Moldova and favors a reduction in its present 
borders. Moreover, the Dneister region is also counting on 
Russia, viewing it as a guarantor of the observance of the 
region's interests. 
  Apart from these already "chronic" problems, the new 
parliament, being guided by the results of the poll, will also 
have to examine the document on the inclusion of the Republic 
into the economic union. 
  There is one other plus: Having clearly indicated its course 
toward independence, the Republic can expect to receive 
attention from Western investors who, until now, have manifested 
caution that has been dictated by uncertainty regarding the 
preservation of Moldova's statehood and also by the unstable 
internal situation. 
  It is not only the isolated regions but also the 
Russian-speaking population on the right bank who link their 
hopes to the new parliament. Having voted for the agrarians and 
the socialists, they have a right to count on the resolution of 
the problems of the national minorities. There is, as yet, no 
corresponding law in the republic whereas the state language 
tests announced for March threaten to lead to mass dismissals of 
nonnative specialists. The Russian-speaking population 
supported the new parliament by taking part in the poll. It is 
now up to the deputies to take effective steps. 
  At a press conference held to discuss the results of the 
poll, the following statistics were made public: Of those who 
took part in the plebiscite on the given question, 95 percent 
gave a positive answer. The most active participation was noted 
in the south and in the northern regions of the Republic. This 
amounted to 98 percent in Oknitsa rayon. In 12 of the 43 
regions, more than 90 percent of eligible voters participated in 
the poll, while the turnout was more than 80 percent in 15 
regions. The most passive were the inhabitants of Ungheni, 
[name indistinct], Cahul, and Chisinau. 
  On 6 March, there were several attempts to blockade 
precincts 
where the poll was been conducted. In Cahul, law enforcement 
bodies were brought into action to restore order. 
  In the opinion of the republican commission, the MOLDOVA 
PRESS Agency did not show any interest in the event while the 
most objective information was disseminated by ROMPRESS. 
Incidentally, Romanian television used disinformation in its 
reports. 
  According to members of the commission, the results of the 
poll will form the basis of Moldova's new constitution.

  [Text] The Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs says that 
all the most important political and economic interests of 
Lithuania were included in the draft Lithuanian-Polish treaty. 
  The statement issued yesterday notes that discussions 
concerning the Lithuanian-Polish treaty on friendly relations 
and good-neighborly cooperation, which is due to be signed, 
often acquire the nature of unilateral accusations. 
  The concern by the Ministry of Foreign affairs was caused by 
a statement issued by a group of Kaunas City Council deputies 
which categorically demands that the text of the draft treaty be 
made public and even points out which concepts should be 
included into the text of the draft treaty. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the negotiations 
with Poland were proceeding according to the principles of 
international law and practice and according to the decision of 
1992 adopted by the government of Lithuania, which says that 
information about negotiations with foreign countries up until 
the signing of the agreement is a state secret of the Republic 
of Lithuania. 
  The Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejects any such 
pressure as an attempt to influence the course of negotiations 
and to complicate mutual relations of the two states. As is 
known, in a democratic country confidence in the quality of work 
of the diplomatic service is tested and verified during the 
ratification of the signed treaty in parliament.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 15, BNS -- The Episcopal Conference of 
Lithuania, the highest governing body of the Lithuanian Catholic 
Church, expressed regret about "how irresponsibly the press, 
radio and television use freedom and mislead the public." 
  In a statement circulated Tuesday [15 March], the conference 
said Lithuania is flooded with various religious cults and sects 
that "reject the teaching of the Christian Church, disseminate 
the ideas and superstitions of `the new age,' which are 
extremely dangerous to those who do not have deep Christian 
fundamentals. 
  "We regret that even priests sometimes irresponsibly use 
public communication means and spread ideas that cannot be 
reconciled with the Christian doctrine." The statement mentions 
a case when a priest on television spoke about contacts with 
extraterrestrials. 
  The Episcopal Conference urged media sources to be more 
responsible and not to dig up sensations about "travels in 
space" and other miracles, "which deliberately or 
unintentionally ruin the true faith and contradict the teaching 
of the Church."

  [Text] Vilnius, March 15, ELTA -- On Tuesday the 
subscribers of the newspaper VALSTIECIU LAIKRASTIS received the 
issue with blank pages with the statement of its staff on them. 
This was the protest of the editorial staff of the newspaper 
against the attempts of Labour Democrats to seize the 
independent newspaper. 
  The editorial staff stated that "radical group of Labour 
Democrats suggested to the Government stopping the activities of 
our joint-stock company by seizing its property and shares and 
throwing us out or making their servants". 
  On Tuesday Labour Democrats also publicized their comments 
on 
the action and stated that "the action of the newspaper is not 
original. In 1991 four main Lithuanian dailies launched similar 
action in protest against attempts of Landbergis and Vagnorius 
Government to nationalize them. The journalists' protest was 
not taken into consideration and the VALSTIECIU LAIKRASTIS was 
made dependent on supporters of Landsbergis". 
  The statement also said that "Labour Democrats are not going 
to repeat the methods used by Vagnorius and will try to 
establish the justice in court."

<F P=106> ["Ukraine and Turkey Reach an Agreement on Pipe-Line </F>
Construction To Pump Petroleum From Middle East to Europe" -- 
UKRINFORM headline; from the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 
11 7-13 Mar 94] 
  [Text] The project will allow to merge Ukraine's pipe-line 
infrastructure with the one, which Turkey is developing on its 
territory, to make up the following scheme for transporting 
Middle East petroleum to Europe: Turkey's pipe-line -- and oil 
transshipment terminal -- sea -- the Odessa transshipment 
terminal -- Ukraine's pipe-line to Europe. 
  The project equally meets Turkey's and Ukraine's interests, 
as allowing both nations to maximally diversify their petroleum 
supply sources, and boost their prestige and economic influence 
on the European continent. 
  Considering the project's political and economic 
significance 
Presidents Kravchuk of Ukraine and Demirel of Turkey gave it the 
green light at its early drafting stage and pledged their 
personal support for it. 
  The merger project and its Turkish construction part were 
drafted by the Kiev-based Yugnipronefteprovod research 
institute. According to its experts, the project's pipe-line 
tracing, number of ramifications may be increased or altered, 
depending on the number of parties, which might be interested in 
its implementation. As tentative estimates suggest, the 
original version may cost 2,750 million U.S. dollars. 
  The existent and under construction facilities of the 
transshipment terminal nearby Odessa (the Yuzhny port), which 
are supposed to be able to handle 40 million tons of petroleum a 
year, will allow Ukraine to not only fully meet its domestic 
petroleum requirements, including those of its oil refineries, 
but also pipe large amounts of crude petroleum to nations in 
East, Central and West Europe, which are, same as Ukraine, 
dependent on Russian fuel exports. 
  Thus, this major alternative petroleum supply source is 
expected to lessen Ukraine's dependence on Russia both 
economically and politically. 
  On March 11 President Kravchuk met in Kiev with Vetad 
Birlik, 
Turkish President Demirel's personal envoy and C.E.O. of the 
Birkan firm. 
  The Turkish official stressed the Turkish pipe-line 
project's 
significance, while discussing bilateral business relations 
between the two Pontic nations, as well the importance of the 
two national pipe-line systems' merger. 
  As Mr. Berlik disclosed, negotiations are underway aimed at 
establishment of a Ukrainian-Turkish joint venture, which will 
undertake the major pipe-line construction project. According 
to Mr. Berlik, the Turkish party intends to maximally rely on 
the Ukrainian experts' experience in laying pipe-lines 
(Ukrainian research and construction institutions used to take 
part in pipe- line construction across the former USSR and in 
many foreign countries). 
  In January, 1994 a Ukrainian delegation met with Turkish 
President Demirel, and a tentative agreement was reached on 
cooperation and the President's personal support for the project. 
  As Mr. Berlik further disclosed, Turkey has concluded an 
agreement with Iraq on future petroleum supplies for piping 
petroleum, extracted in the Middle East, to Ukraine and other 
nations in Europe. Eventually, other oil extracting nations may 
join the project, primarily Iran, as petroleum exporters. 
  As the project's architects believe, their brainchild may 
attract many OPEC nations by its much simpler route for oil 
piping, in particular, those of them, who cannot reach an 
agreement among themselves, with European oil producers and with 
Russia on export quotas, all of which, taken together, may 
greatly contribute to the trend to lower petroleum prices on the 
petroleum and petroleum products.

  [Text] Bucharest, 15 Mar TASS -- Ukraine plans to have 
friendly relations with Romania and settle all problems in a 
political way, Ukrainian Defence Minister Army General Vitaliy 
Radetskyy said today upon his arrival in Bucharest with a 
Ukrainian military delegation at the invitation of the Romanian 
defence minister. 
  The visit to last till 17 March includes negotiations with 
Romanian Defence Minister Gheorghe Tinca, head of the Romanian 
Armed Forces General Staff Lieutenant-General Dumitru Cioflina 
and meetings with President Ion Iliescu, Prime Minister Nicolae 
Vacaroiu and Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu. 
  The sides are expected to sign a military cooperation 
agreement. 
  "We had long planned to sign a bilateral accord on military 
cooperation, especially as we have a border running over 600 
kilometers (375 miles) with Romania," said the Ukrainian 
official. "The agreement will help military interaction, 
including joint training of personnel."

the efforts to settle the Abkhazian conflict. In fact, he said, 
he could talk of coordinated efforts for a settlement. 
  However painfully, the Commonwealth had come to realize the 
need for constructive cooperation for reaching enduring peace in 
Georgia and, consequently, Transcaucasia as a whole, and peace 
in that region was of vital importance to Russia, Shevardnadze 
noted.

  [Text] [Announcer] Abkhazia is stopping its peace talks 
with Georgia. Vladislav Ardzinba, the leader of the autonomy, 
says that the decision is due to the fact that the Georgian 
Supreme Council -- quite illegally, in his opinion -- has 
declared the supreme legislative body of the former autonomous 
republic disbanded. 
  [Ardzinba] "The Law on State Power in the Republic of 
Georgia, to which the Georgian Supreme Council refers as the 
legal foundation for its decision, was adopted unilaterally 
after the state and legal relations between Abkhazia and Georgia 
were terminated. In view of this, it cannot apply to events 
taking place on the territory of the Republic of Abkhazia." 
  [Announcer] This is how Valeriy Advadze, the Georgian 
ambassador to Moscow, commented on Ardzinba's statement at our 
request. 
  [Advadze] "This unilateral decision -- well, it is being 
applied to Abkhazia and the Supreme Soviet of Abkhazia that was 
elected on the basis of a discriminatory law when 17 to 18 
percent of the electorate had 28 seats in parliament, whereas 50 
percent of the Georgian population had 26 seats. I do not think 
another such discriminative law exists anywhere in the world -- 
this is simply impossible. Therefore, the fact that this law 
was made invalid, together with the Supreme Soviet elected on 
the basis of this law, is simply a belated measure. It should 
not have been adopted in the first place, or it should have been 
removed earlier." 
  [Announcer] I would like to point out, however, that 
Georgian 
leader Eduard Shevardnadze considers the decision of the 
Georgian Supreme Council to disband the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet 
a rash measure. 
  Also today, Vladislav Ardzinba spoke sharply against the UN 
peacekeeping troops being introduced in the republic without the 
consent of the Abkhazian [Ardzinba] "If these troops are 
introduced throughout the territory of Abkhazia in the interest 
of the Georgian side, we will regard this as occupation, as an 
attempt to occupy the territory of Abkhazia, with all the 
ensuing consequences. I do not think there is any need to say 
anything else." 
  [Announcer] Valeriy Advadze, the Georgian ambassador to 
Moscow, comments again. 
  [Advadze] "The peacekeeping troops, if they do come, should 
be deployed on the entire territory of Abkhazia so as to insure 
that the residents who fled from there, the refugees, can return 
and to guarantee a normal life and safety for them when they 
return. It cannot be otherwise." 
  [Announcer] This evening the Russian Foreign Ministry 
expressed its concern over the developments in Abkhazia and the 
emergence of a real threat of armed clashes.

to Abkhazia, Advadze said that Russia, the U.S. and the UN "have 
the power to bridle aggressive separatism." According to the 
ambassador, Ardzinba was guided by separatism when he launched 
the war, even though he spoke of Abkhazia's willingness to join 
Russia. The diplomat added that Ardzinba "will not agree to any 
treaties or compromises, he will not be content with any 
federation or confederation, he wants only full independence." 
  The ambassador stressed that the United States and the UN 
Security Council like Russia before them have supported Georgia 
in matters of territorial integrity.

  [Text] Today the leaders of Abkhazia made it clear to 
journalists that after Shevardnadze's visit to the United States 
and his speech in the United Nations, and after the decision of 
the Georgian Parliament on the dissolution of the Parliament of 
Abkhazia, the continuation of the talks between delegations of 
both sides in Geneva and New York is not possible. Ardzinba 
pointed out that the Georgian version of applying in all cases 
to the United Nations, allegedly for peacemaking aims, is in 
fact expected to solve those problems which have not been 
decided by Georgian tanks, that is, to abolish the organs of 
power in Abkhazia and return the refugees. 
  Meanwhile, the West is interested in having NATO forces 
standing along the border with Russia. As for Russian troops: 
  [Begin voice recording by V. Ardzinba, Chairman of the 
Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Abkhazia identified by 
caption] Whether Russian troops are needed in Georgia, that is a 
question which should be decided by Georgia and Russia. As for 
Abkhazia, we are in favour of such troops being on the territory 
of Abkhazia, but the question of the status of those troops and 
the conditions of their presence should be solved directly 
between the organs of power of Abkhazia and Russia. [end

  [Text] The Georgian parliament passed a resolution 
introducing amendments to the republican law on the cabinet of 
ministers. The amendments mainly apply to the procedure for 
voting on confidence in the government, either initiated by the 
republic's legislature or the head of state. 
  According to the document, the head of state or one fifth of 
deputies are entitled to initiate a vote of confidence in the 
government. The decision on the issue will be taken by a 
majority of the total number of deputies. 
  After nearly a year of discussion, the deputies passed a law 
on arms Tuesday. According to the law, all individuals will 
have the right to keep properly registered smoothbore arms at 
home. 
  As for legal entities, the Georgian Interior Ministry may 
give them permission to posess handguns. All individuals will 
be entitled to carry CS gas pistols. The law will come into 
force on May 15, 1994. 
  At a proposal by Eduard Shevardnadze, the consideration of 
the composition of the government was put off for a week. 
Shevardnadze said he would submit a final list of the members 
of a future government.

<F P=106> [Untitled comments by Yegor Gaydar of "Russia's Choice" and </F>
Sergey Khramov of Association of Socialist Trade Unions under 
"Opinions" rubric] 
  [Text] Yegor Gaydar: 
  We certainly favor accord if it really is a question of 
civil 
accord. In this we do, of course, support the idea voiced by 
the president [of a memorandum on civil peace and accord]. The 
crux of the matter, in my view, consists in just one thing. If 
the memorandum is adopted in order to comply with it, if forces 
prepared to sign it agree to assume responsibility for the 
political conduct of their supporters, for their compliance with 
order, and for their rejection of propaganda of violence, of 
course we are in favor, but if this is another fig leaf designed 
to cover up activity aimed at destabilizing the situation in 
Russia, fanning social strife, and provoking public disorders 
and to cover up the increasing pressure on the authorities and 
the increasing discrediting of the institutions of Russian 
statehood, we will not participate in such a sly game. 
  Sergey Khramov: 
  The idea of social peace is a very good idea, particularly 
as 
the trade unions cannot work under other conditions, and they 
more than anyone need stability and peace. But any agreement 
presupposes obligations: Who gives what and who receives what, 
otherwise the contract will not work. Unfortunately, we now 
place very great emphasis on the purely political aspects, and 
the economy is regarded only as one aspect of politics. 
Meanwhile, labor relations should not be underestimated as a 
very influential factor in politics. But it now turns out that 
we are introducing market relations into production, while 
manpower is being sold and bought according to the old, 
nonmarket rules. This is why there is such a large gap between 
wages and prices and why there is social tension. The free 
trade unions would like to introduce market relations also into 
the sphere of labor relations. In our view, the memorandum must 
indicate specific obligations and specify liability for 
violations of them. We are prepared to sign such an agreement. 
In addition, we will uphold the trade unions' right to strike, 
only not as a weapon to pressure the authorities and the 
government, but as a working instrument for resolving 
disagreements between hired workers and employers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report of statement by Vladimir Lysenko: </F>
"Moderate Opposition Interested in Stability, State Duma Deputy 
Vladimir Lysenko Believes"] 
  [Text] The recent Kremlin meeting shows that the president 
would really like to sign a memorandum of agreement, but how 
effective would such a document be? I recall that throughout 
the course of last year we had several "roundtables" and some 
very important documents on agreement were signed, but they have 
not been carried out and have had no substantive impact on the 
political situation. Today there is little correlation between 
the authorities and society's political forces. All the changes 
to the power structures have no connection with the situation in 
parliament, with the positions held by political parties, or 
with the demands of the trade unions. That is why the 
opposition undoubtedly has an interest in fundamentally 
resolving the question of power -- that is, winning the 1996 
elections. And, in this sense, a moderate and calm opposition 
could have an interest in some kinds of consensual documents so 
as to buy time and prevent radicals on both flanks from 
destabilizing the situation in the country.

<F P=106> [Lyubov Tsukanova report: "Do Not Spill the Cup of </F>
Accord.... Signature to Memorandum -- Society Will Finally See 
Who Is Interested in a Political Breathing Space, Who Does Not 
Want To Reach Agreement, and Who Violates the Accords"] 
  [Text] President Yeltsin had a meeting in the Kremlin with 
representatives of parties, political movements, the parliament, 
and the government on the subject of preparing a draft 
memorandum on civil peace and accord. An idea that arose as a 
result of the emotional events of late February and early March 
connected with the political amnesty has thus begun to acquire 
organizational dimensions. Boris Yeltsin believes the draft 
document may be ready in two weeks. 
  We would remind you that the package of amnesty documents 
which the State Duma adopted 23 February included the 
"Memorandum of Accord," which spoke of the need to exclude 
violence from political life. However, statements by one body 
-- even one as prestigious as the State Duma -- are patently not 
enough to secure civil peace. Accord presupposes agreement 
among all parties to the political process -- the authorities, 
the social forces and their leaders, who should probably also 
encompass those people who today more than anything generate 
suspicions regarding the intention to or possibility of 
destabilizing the country's political life. That was why the 
president started off the process of preparing the memorandum, 
which is designed to be the means of maintaining tranquillity. 
The plan is for the document to be signed by as many political 
parties and movements as possible. 
  However, can a document -- even such a reputable and 
representative document -- prevent the country slipping into 
chaos? Hardly. A memorandum is not a law, it is a political 
statement of intent. Everything depends on whether the 
country's leading political and social forces with influence 
among the masses really intend to do everything they can to 
maintain civil peace, or whether for some people this is nothing 
more than a tactical maneuver. Whether people who disagree with 
the reform course, as well as its supporters, are really 
prepared to use constitutional and legal means and methods alone 
in their political campaigning. And, last, whether politicians 
are ready to renounce for a while quite legal but "drastic" and 
therefore dangerous methods (rallies, demonstrations, strikes) 
that may capsize the ship of state. 
  In order to ensure that the memorandum does not become just 
another piece of paper without any real force, I believe that 
these intentions should be announced in public before the 
agreement is signed -- after they have been seriously and 
thoroughly discussed by all structures in society. Signatures 
to the memorandum will only mean something once these signatures 
are backed up not just by leaders' personal aspirations but the 
clearly expressed will of political and social groups large and 
small. Definite steps and statements on the part of the 
president and the government would probably also not be 
superfluous to the achievement of trust: Stability in society 
does not only depend on political leaders' activeness but also 
on the actions taken by the authorities, their readiness to heed 
public opinion, take a calm view of dissent, and cooperate 
constructively with all social structures. 
  Needless to say, no one will provide absolute guarantees 
that, first, all significant forces involved in the political 
process will want to subscribe to the memorandum and, second, 
that even if they do sign, they will not breach the agreement. 
But even in that case the idea of a memorandum has one plus 
going for it -- its visibility [naglyadnost]. 
  A social contract primarily means the redistribution of 
responsibility. Social structures voluntarily assume some of 
the duties of maintaining social peace in the common interest. 
But that does not mean that the state authority can thus shift 
its responsibility onto society's shoulders. The memorandum on 
civil peace and accord may indicate to the authorities whether 
they are capable, in conditions of a political breathing space, 
of creating a material base for real and not just "agreed" 
political stability -- primarily to stabilize the economy, curb 
crime, and limit bureaucratic tyranny. Society is getting a 
chance to test not only the strength of its own influence but 
also the real strength of the authorities -- the extent of its 
competence, political will, reformist potential, and 
responsibility to the country's citizens.

<F P=106> [By S. Sokolova; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP] met with leaders of Russian and foreign banks in the 
Parliamentary Center today. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of 
the party, emphasized that the Liberal Democrats today are in 
favor of economic stability in Russia and the development of 
private entrepreneurship, and that they will put through 
parliament a number of laws that will help Russian banks to work 
normally. He also reported that the country is now entering a 
new stage of political construction, and if the communists are 
allowed to come to power Russia could plunge into ruin, that is, 
there would be no healthy capitalism and private banks. Yet if 
the rudder passes to Russia's Choice, all Russian money will 
rapidly go to the West. 
  After some eulogistic speeches were made about his party, 
Zhirinovskiy complained about the government, which in their 
opinion has still not collected the taxes for 1993 and has not 
confirmed in the State Duma the budget for 1994.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Leontyev report under the "Bluff" rubric with </F>
general heading: "Zhirinovskiy Solves His Nonpayment Problem. 
A Bankrupt Meets Bankers"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, Mr. Zhirinovskiy, who had attempted 
during his spectacular election campaign to pay with false 
pay-sheets and "slush-fund cash" for the air time accorded to 
him, tried to persuade Russian bankers at his faction's meeting 
to finance his future election campaign (or maybe also his 
previous one in view of his obvious bankruptcy). 
  Representatives of 80 banks were invited to attend the 
meeting together with members of the Russian and Moscow 
governments, revenue services, and so forth. According to 
SEGODNYA's information, neither the top chiefs nor 
representatives of any reputable banks were seen at the meeting. 
A large number of Russian and particularly foreign journalists 
were present as usual. Generally speaking, as practice has 
shown, Zhirinovskiy is much better consumed on the foreign 
market than on the domestic one. 
  The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] could not 
please the bankers with its traditional buffoonery at the 
meeting: When you ask for money, you have to behave 
appropriately. Zhirinovskiy simply said that banks should help 
the LDPR because it is precisely this party that guarantees 
stability in the country. "I want to give a signal from our 
party so that you could correctly assess the situation and help 
us financially." LDPR representatives explained that they are 
not fascists but simple patriots, and that they will prevent the 
fascists from coming to power. 
  It turned out that the LDPR stands for the Chinese model, a 
stance evidently meant to give Zhirinovskiy a certain air of 
respectability a la Mr. Volskiy. 
  Getting down to business, Zhirinovskiy told the audience 
that 
a total of 22 trillion rubles [R] is sitting idly in Russian 
banks. He did not ask "to give him all the profits," he just 
suggested that they share with him 1 percent of the amount. 
That is, the bankrupt lays claim to a meager R220 billion. 
  During the meeting, LDPR members wondered about the behavior 
by chiefs of GMM [a foreign bank implicated in possible LDPR 
election misconduct], who, in their view, "do not realize their 
own advantage" as they stubbornly deny that they had financed 
Zhirinovskiy. LDPR speakers said that the company's ability to 
finance "the most stable party" should have been its best 
advertisement. 
  As a matter of fact, earlier Zhirinovskiy had time to meet 
with Richard Nixon, former U.S. president, behind closed doors 
at the Balchug-Kempinsky hotel, where the American guest is 
staying. Zhirinovskiy conveyed through Mr. Nixon his message to 
the incumbent U.S. President and his autographed two books. Let 
us hope that the former president is wise enough not to hand 
this trash over to Mr. Clinton. 
  To all appearances, Zhirinovskiy will get no serious money 
from mentally sound bankers. Evidently, the claimant himself 
has also realized that. Upon ending the meeting, he told the 
journalists that 21 September of last year may recur one of 
these days. "All characteristics are present, symptoms are 
evident; papers, documents are ready, troops have long been 
brought in for street clashes." Evidently, a difficult time has 
set in for Zhirinovskiy's party. The only thing that could save 
it is yet more bloody turmoil that the Nazi leader is trying his 
best to foment.

  [Text] The plenum of the Central Executive Committee of the 
Russian Communist Party (led by Gennadiy Zyuganov) has decided 
to establish a public commission to investigations the events in 
Moscow on October 3-4, 1993. 
  It was pointed out that after the State Duma's resolution on 
political amnesty, the parliamentary commission for 
investigations into these events had been dissolved. According 
to the Communist activists, this lets those responsible for the 
bloodshed avoid punishment. 
  The Communist Party's plenum also addressed the Russian 
government with an open statement expressing concern over 
"unprecedented destruction of Russian agriculture." 
  The statement emphasized that the current government's 
policy 
was making Russian agriculture insolvent since it was supporting 
foreign farmers. Communist Party activists believe that the 
issue must be discussed urgently before the situation gets out 
of control. This could trigger off unpredictable consequences, 
the statement said. 
  The plenum adopted the party's draft program "From Crisis to 
Sustained Development." The program states that Russia must 
finally become a state with a socialist economy established 
after the nationalization of private property." 
  The Communists stressed that a regime of personal 
presidential power had been set up in Russia after the new 
constitution had been adopted by a minority of the population. 
The Communist program considers it to be a "juridical and 
political confirmation of dictatorship by corrupted capital." 
  The program of the Communist Party is to be submitted for 
consideration at the party's third congress this autumn.

  [Text] Moscow March 15 TASS -- Russia's Communist Party 
does not want to confine itself to purely parliamentary 
activities, but intends to adopt a programme of concrete actions 
in various direction for the next couple of years. 
  This programme of action, together with the theses of the 
party's detailed programme, was submitted on Tuesday for the 
consideration of a plenary meeting of the Communist Party's 
Central Executive Committee. Addressing the meeting with a 
report, party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov noted that all the 
previous hypothetical programmes just described the communists' 
intentions in case of their coming to power. In contrast to 
them, now the party should develop a plan of concrete actions. 
"We are to formulate our tasks exactly as an opposition force", 
Zyuganov added. 
  The communist leader expounded on the principal ideas to 
form 
the basis of the proposed programme of action. Remaining in 
opposition to the political and economic course followed by the 
Russian president and government, the Communist Party plans to 
make its contribution to the process of achieving civic peace 
and accord. However, Zyuganov said, civic peace does not mean 
universal fraternization. Struggle between various social 
trends is inevitable, but it should not destroy the state, he 
stressed. To prevent this, a broad coalition should be formed. 
"The political spectrum of such a coalition may prove quite 
extensive and range from communists and socialists through 
nationalist patriotic movements to centrists and true 
democrats", the leader specified. 
  Zyuganov recalled the conditions that the parliament's 
communist faction considers necessary to achieve civic peace. 
They provide for an immediate turnabout on the current social 
and economic line, formation of "a government of national 
confidence resting on parliamentary majority" (which "calls for 
removal from the government of such people as Kozyrev, Chubays 
and others"), immediate payoff of debts to peasants and of 
delayed wages to workers, urgent measures to fight corruption 
and organized crime, as well as "restoration of a renewed union 
state on a voluntary basis at Russia's initiative". 
  According to the communist leader, the strategic goal at the 
current stage is to expand the opposition footing, to build on 
this basis a large-scale bloc of forces and to push it to power 
by parliamentary means. Early presidential elections (without 
Boris Yeltsin's participation) would be the best variant, 
Zyuganov believes. 
  The party leader expressed regret over increasing political 
inertness in Russia and urged party members to prepare "quietly 
and pragmatically" for a new upsurge in social activities. The 
Communist Party's primary organizations, whose age and social 
composition "is not in line with the spirit of the times", 
should work for "rejuvenation of the party" and "stop stewing in 
their own juice". Zyuganov called to put into practice "the 
small steps theory": to set up standing election committees, to 
participate in public organizations, above all in trade-unions, 
to step up propaganda activities and so forth. 
  The short-term programme of action is expected to be adopted 
at the Communist Party's conference in April, while the detailed 
strategic programme is to be passed at the 3rd party congress 
scheduled for this autumn.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Communist Party Secretary Gennadiy </F>
Zyuganov by Mauro De Bonis in Moscow; date not given: "Trust 
Me, I Will Be Your Brezhnev"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [De Bonis] Mr. Zyuganov, are 
you happy about the amnesty that freed Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and 
others who took part in the confrontation between Parliament and 
Yeltsin last October? 
  [Zyuganov] The amnesty decreed by the Duma is the victory of 
reason. However, we must not forget that it is only a first 
step in the right direction. The second step is to remove from 
power the incompetent people that are selling off our country. 
  [De Bonis] Will this amnesty benefit Yeltsin or the 
opposition? 
  [Zyuganov] It will be to everyone's advantage. However, the 
radical democrats do not want to understand this, and the mass 
media continues to utter hysterical cries and predict that there 
will be a bloody clash. I assume that they have still not 
assessed the political importance of what has happened, but it 
would be better for them to think this over well. 
  [De Bonis] Immediately after the liberation of the prisoners 
there was talk of civil war. 
  [Zyuganov] If there is going to be a civil war, Europe will 
experience terrible hours. Rather, it would be a catastrophe 
for the entire planet. The Russian ship must travel in calm 
waters if it wants to berth in a good port. 
  [De Bonis] Let us talk about the economy a little. President 
Yeltsin has abandoned his shock therapy policy. Was this the 
victory of the people over the reformers? 
  [Zyuganov] It was the victory of sound thinking over those 
who tried to destroy Russia. You cannot talk of reforms when 
the state is falling apart, when half of the factories are not 
working, when the aged are being humiliated, when culture, the 
economy, and the moral foundations of our population are being 
destroyed. Europe will soon realize what the destructive 
process has brought and what it itself contributed by supporting 
first Gorbachev and then Yeltsin. 
  [De Bonis] Who is responsible? 
  [Zyuganov] The real author of this policy is the IMF, whose 
development models were imposed upon Russia as has already 
happened in Latin America. For the IMF bosses it is a matter of 
transforming the economy of a country into an economic space to 
be exploited to its own advantage, and the results to date are: 
in Yugoslavia their models have led to a ferocious war, in 
Czechoslovakia the country has been divided into two, in Poland 
industrial production has fallen by 40 percent. 
  [De Bonis] What are the objectives of the Russian 
Communists? 
  [Zyuganov] Our objective is to change the course of the 
shock 
therapy into a normal evolutionary development of reforms, and 
to work to bring about a new growth in culture, science, and 
health. Moreover, it will be necessary to take the appropriate 
measures to protect the elderly and children. To put a moral 
brake on the pornography that is rampant in the country and to 
stop the spreading Americanization, primarily through television. 
  [De Bonis] Are you still against the Americans? It seems 
that President Clinton looks favorably on a strong Communist 
Party in Russia. 
  [Zyuganov] We have nothing against the Americans. They have 
had to take note that there has been a new political situation 
in Russia since 12 December and they know well that continuing 
to support the shock therapy would have led to disorder at the 
international level. For this reason I now prefer a policy of 
stability. I can no longer support just Russia's Choice (the 
party close to Yeltsin). More support to Yeltsin could lead to 
the spread of anti-Americanism, as was the case with Gorbachev. 
A situation very similar to the "Cold War" situation. We do 
not want this kind of relationship with the Americans.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 15 Mar -- The process of the restoration of 
the autonomy of the Germans in Russia is only possible through a 
mass movement "from below" in the places where they live in 
large numbers, thinks Sergey Shakhray, Russian Federation 
minister for nationalities and regional policy. He declared 
this today at a press conference. Sergey Shakhray called such a 
movement "the concept of the self-organization of the Russian 
Germans." 
  In his view, Germans living in our country must, first of 
all, decide for themselves on how to restore their autonomy, 
liaising with the organs of power in the regions where they live 
in large numbers. Only then, he pointed out, will there be a 
real possibility of passing a federal law to that effect. 
  Sergey Shakhray also informed journalists about his recent 
trip to Bonn, where he attended the fifth sitting of the 
Russo-German intergovernmental commission on the problems of the 
Russian Germans. According to the minister, the Russian side 
confirmed its opinion that the Russian Germans can and must 
remain in the Russian Federation. The rights of the Russian 
Germans, repressed in 1941, must be restored. 
  At the sitting of the commission, the minister noted, there 
was discussion of the problems involved in financing the 
restoration of the Russian Germans' autonomy. At present, there 
is no coordination of the sides in this matter, since the 
Germans do not trust our state organizations and pass their part 
of the funds allocated to the implementation of the program 
through private intermediary structures. There are cases of the 
squandering and "disappearance without trace" of the German part 
of the funds. 
  But now, Sergey Shakhray stressed, the sides have agreed 
that, in order to prevent such a situation arising, a special 
Russian-German foundation and, at the local level, 
Russian-German societies will monitor the distribution of funds 
at federal level.

<F P=106> ["Own Information" report: "A Day In the Life of the Secret </F>
Services: Fiery Hearts Will Set Ministry of Justice Aflame"] 
  [Text] It was announced by a well-informed staffer of the 
Russian Federation Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] 
central apparatus that the possibility of breaking up the FCS 
and transferring its functions to other structures is being 
studied in the president's administration as one of the options 
for reorganizing this department. Specifically, it is proposed 
to transfer the FCS Counterintelligence Operations Directorate 
to the Ministry of Justice, transforming it into a Federal 
Bureau of Investigations. The Economic Counterintelligence 
Directorate and the Directorate for Guaranteeing Security at 
Strategically Important Industrial Facilities would be rendered 
subordinate to the Ministry of the Economy, while military 
counterintelligence would be placed under the wings of the 
General Staff as an autonomous directorate. The fight against 
terrorism will switch to the competence of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs. The author of the plan for eliminating the 
FCS is a member of the Security Council. 
  Our correspondent met with new FCS Chief Sergey Stepashin 
and 
asked him to explain his future plans at this post. The FCS 
chief reported that very soon he will hold a meeting with the 
Russian president. He did not deny reports that Boris Yeltsin 
has been in receipt of suggestions for reorganizing this 
service, including transferring its powers to other departments. 
"If these suggestions are implemented, the security organs will 
be dealt a major blow. I am categorically against this, and I 
am against anybody who puts such suggestions forward. It is 
necessary to ponder why they are doing this. I am deeply 
convinced that Russia and the president need strong secret 
services. And it is this stance which I will be defending at 
the meeting with Yelstin," Stepashin declared.

  [Text] A senior source at Russia's Federal 
Counterintelligence Service (FSK) [FCS] has denied media reports 
that FSK Director Sergey Stepashin went into hospital after 
meeting President Boris Yeltsin on March 11. 
  "Our life is full of rumors," Aleksandr Mikhailov, head of 
the FSK Public Relations Center, told Interfax on Tuesday. "In 
this particular case an elegant form was found to make gossip 
sound official, with some kind of source being cited `who asked 
not to be identified.'" 
  "Yes, Stepashin did have a meeting on March 11, but with 
Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and not with the president," 
Mikhailov continued. "Neither that meeting nor [Stepashin's] 
telephone conversation with Yeltsin could have given the FSK 
director any cause for concern. Mood is not always a reason to 
see a doctor anyway." 
  Mikhailov said Stepashin was currently at work.

  [Text] In the near term the amount of TV and radio 
broadcasting will not be reduced as it was on February 10, 
"however, in general such an action is quite possible," Chairman 
of the Central Committee of the Trade Union of 
Telecommunications Workers Anatoly Nazeikin declared to INTERFAX 
on Wednesday while commenting on related TV stories. 
  He also reported that since the beginning of this year 
analogical problems appeared among telecommunications employees 
who only now received payment for last year's debts for 
broadcasting of state TV and radio programs. In addition, 
agreements with TV and radio companies have not been concluded 
yet because the quantity of broadcasting to be done is as yet 
unknown. 
  Nazeikin underlined that the issues concerning mutual 
payments between collectives of broadcasting centers and TV and 
radio companies were to be solved in the course of the meeting 
between representatives of telecommunications workers and Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin scheduled "for the near term." 
However, this meeting has not taken place. If this continues 
till the end of March, Nazeikin continued, we shall be forced to 
cut back TV and radio broadcasting time for the majority of 
Russia's regions. (On February 10 broadcasting was limited in 61 
regions -- INTERFAX).

  [Text] At the beginning of this month the All-Russia 
Television and Radio Company was given notice by Mr. Belov, 
general director of the Rostelekom joint-stock company, that the 
acceptance and processing of orders for the provision of 
intercity and international television and sound broadcasting 
channels would be suspended from 15 March. 
  This means that Russian television and radio are unable to 
have good-quality and stable communications with their 
correspondents in any of the regions of our country. The 
management of the Russian Television and Radio Company has held 
intensive talks with Russian Communications Minister Vladimir 
Bulgak, who gave the assurance that there would be no 
disconnection from communications channels. 
  Today, however, the Rostelekom joint-stock company refused 
to 
accept and deal with orders from television and radio companies, 
citing a directive from the joint-stock company's management. 
All attempts today to talk to the Russian communications 
minister have been unsuccessful, although, according to our 
information, he had received information about the desperate 
plight in which radio and television find themselves yet again. 
  It seems that today the language of the ultimatum is the 
only 
way in which Russian communications workers can voice their 
interests.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 16 TASS -- Aleksandr Livshits, leader 
of a group of experts to the president of Russia, is against the 
passage of bills on an economic state of emergency and on the 
restoration of administrative mechanisms of management, 
including a wage freeze. 
  In a statement received by ITAR-TASS on Wednesday [16 
March], 
Livshits admits that "the Federal Assembly, of course, has the 
right to determine legislative work priorities". However, 
Livshits, dr. of science (economics), is of the opinion that 
"the Russian economy is now in need of a legislative basis for a 
market economy, not a state of emergency which would not resolve 
a single deep-seated problem". 
  Livshits also points out that "the government, basing itself 
on the presidential message to the Federal Assembly, must 
energetically implement its programme and monitor the situation. 
The government should not be pulled about and rendered 
panicky," he emphasises. 
  The presidential message determines a reform strategy and 
basic guidelines for domestic and foreign policies. "No such 
thing as an economic state of emergency is spelled out there," 
the presidential adviser noted. 
  "The president makes active efforts in a quest for national 
concord. Any actions of the Federal Assembly in this respect 
will find understanding and support. But concord does not mean 
a renunciation of reform or a rollback to unjustified emergency 
measures," Livshits stressed.

Trillion for Fighting Crime"] 
  [Text] A federal crime fighting program for 1994 and 1995 
has been formed and a presidential edict for its approval is now 
in the works. This was announced by Viktor Yerin, head of the 
Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, at a scheduled news 
briefing there yesterday. According to the minister, this 
program has been elaborated on Boris Yeltsin's personal 
instructions with all Russian ministries and agencies taking 
part in putting it together. In Mr. Yerin's words, it has a 
fundamentally new nature, and it is not going to end up in 
mid-air, as has happened more than once. The program is to be 
financed mainly by ministries and agencies (with virtually all 
taking part in it), each taking care of its own sphere. All in 
all nearly 2 trillion rubles at current prices would be required 
to implement it.

<F P=106> [Igor Petrov report: "If You're Not Paid, Sue. President </F>
Defends Citizens' Labor Rights"] 
  [Text] Boris Yeltsin signed an edict 10 March which, in 
the opinion of many observers, could fundamentally change the 
situation regarding now-familiar wage payment delays. 
  The edict "On Responsibility for Violations of Citizens' 
Labor Rights" instructs the Russian Federation Prosecutor's 
Office to "carry out careful checks into every instance of the 
violation of workers' legitimate rights" and to institute 
proceedings against those responsible for holding up payments. 
  The courts have been instructed to pay particular attention, 
when hearing cases of the violation of labor legislation, to the 
need to eradicate such violations, including in respect of 
delayed pay. 
  The government has been instructed to submit proposals to 
the 
State Duma within one month on amendments and additions to 
existing criminal and administrative legislation, "envisaging 
the strengthening and clarification of responsibility for the 
violation of labor legislation and collective contracts and 
agreements." 
  I do not think there is any need to explain what prompted 
the 
appearance of the president's edict, and the effect on society's 
social and political health of the nonpayment of two-three 
months' wages is also probably clear to everyone. 
  Of course, delays in paying wages are a natural 
manifestation 
of an even more dangerous disease. Nonpayments, like rust, 
affect the entire economic mechanism. The failure to pay bills 
has become not only not dangerous but even economically 
advantageous. Inflation eats away at the creditor's funds, 
reducing the borrower's debt. The banks rapidly recycle funds 
received from enterprises, earning fabulous rates of interest. 
  But maybe enterprises really do not have the money to pay 
each other? Unfortunately, this is by no means always the case. 
According to Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko, 
enterprises hold 22 trillion rubles [R] in accounts at 
commercial banks. They also hold foreign exchange equivalent to 
R26 trillion. Add to this around $18-22 billion held abroad, 
and the sum is gigantic. And yet the government is getting just 
one demand from all over -- give us money. 
  To a certain extent this ardor may be dampened by Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's statement to the extended Council of Ministers. 
He stressed that it is time for creditors themselves to learn 
how to recover their debts through the courts without hoping for 
another round of mutual debt offsetting. "Those who do not have 
the money to pay their debts should go into bankruptcy and be 
responsible with their own property for the damage they have 
done," the premier said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 15 TASS -- Some 16,000,000,000,000 
rubles worth of consumer debt to the Russian fuel and energy 
complex was registered in early February as compared to 
12,000,000,000,000 rubles on January 1, 1994. This debt is half 
of all non-payments in the Russian economy. 
  Russian Fuel and Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik told 
parliament hearings on non-payments today that the fuel and 
energy situation is most complicated and fraught with grave 
consequences for both the complex and the whole economy. 
  A reason for this is insufficient circulating assets of 
enterprises, imperfection of the legislation and low financial 
discipline of consumers, said Shafranik. 
  In his opinion, it is necessary to adopt a decree on 
regulated payments for fuel and energy in order to ensure severe 
sanctions against the non-payers and their priority payments for 
the supplies. Off-setting of mutual obligations of the budget 
and fuel and energy enterprises, as well as the transfer of the 
2,500,000,000,000 ruble debt of Commonwealth states to the 
complex's account will help settle the problem as well. 
  Experts believe 1,500,000,000,000 rubles worth of 
allocations 
and off-setting of mutual debts worth 5,000,000,000,000 rubles 
would be enough to remove financial tension in the fuel and 
energy complex.

  [Text] Russia's Defense Minister Pavel Grachev held a news 
conference today. He said that a criticial situation has arisen 
as regards financing the Armed Forces. Thus, in January of this 
year, the Defense Ministry received only 63 percent of the 
planned appropriations. Pavel Grachev stated that if in the 
very near future the situation does not improve there cannot be 
any question of any reforming of the Army or of maintaining its 
high combat effectiveness. He said that this year the Army 
would in real terms be cut by 200,000 men instead of the 
scheduled 400,000. The reason for this is that it is more 
expensive to discharge an officer than to keep him -- each 
officer being discharged needs to be simultaneously paid 20 
monthly wages. This year purchases of armaments will be 
considerably reduced. This could have a deplorable effect on 
the defense industry enterprises and the development of new 
military technologies. Pavel Grachev strongly criticized the 
way trade in Russian arms is being conducted: He believes that 
opportunities to earn billions of rubles are being missed. 
  The journalists also inquired how the Army would react to a 
possible increase in social tension in the country. Grachev 
said that the armed forces are outside politics, but would not 
permit a civil war.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Yermolin report: "Oleg Soskovets Is Opposed to </F>
Further Reducing the Defense Budget"] 
  [Text] The news conference which Oleg Soskovets, first 
deputy chairman of the Russian Federation Government, held 
Monday inaugurates a series of meetings between members of the 
government and journalists. 
  Among the problems facing the Cabinet of Ministers today 
Oleg 
Soskovets named "the state's participation in the country's 
economic development, the improvement of tax policy, the 
elimination of nonpayments, and the social thrust of reforms." 
The government is particularly concerned at the situation in 
the social sphere, in agriculture, and in the 
military-industrial complex. According to Soskovets, a complex 
situation is taking shape in the military-industrial complex 
today. Economic ties between enterprises have been ruptured by 
ill-considered conversion, and in some places the defense 
industry's scientific and production potential has been 
seriously undermined. 
  A further reduction in the defense budget could lead to the 
total stoppage of production facilities working for the needs of 
defense. Reducing expenditure on the Armed Forces means 
"freezing" the further course of reforms and of structural 
restructuring in the Russian Army. As Oleg Soskovets said, the 
government is drawing up measures to encourage production in the 
sphere of the military-industrial complex. In particular, 
conditions are being created for emerging onto the foreign 
market and expanding the defense industry's export potential. 
  As regards the state budget as a whole for 1994, in Oleg 
Soskovets' opinion the revenue part has not been worked out 
here. For example, the planned revenue from privatization has 
been understated. But the budget will be finalized in the 
government as early as this week, and the document will be 
submitted to the State Duma committees. At present the budget 
deficit stands at 9.9 percent. 
  The government is concerned at the social stratification of 
society, which is unprecedented on the scale of modern civilized 
countries, when approximately 30 percent of the population is 
living below the poverty line, while the incomes of another 
section of Russians are growing inordinately. At the same time 
commercial activity is most lucrative, as distinct from activity 
in the sphere of physical production.

  [Text] Moscow, 14 Mar -- The Russian Federation has the 
most up-to-date defensive weapons systems, it is willing to 
trade with them, and weapons made in Russia can ensure the 
security and sovereignty of any state. Such are the remarks 
made by Oleg Soskovets, a first deputy chairman of the Russian 
Federation Government, on the pages of an issue of the VOYENNYY 
PARAD journal issued here. 
  Viktor Glukhikh, the chairman of the state committee for 
defense sectors, analyzes the state of Russia's 
military-industrial sector. He notes, in particular, that the 
volume of production of arms and military equipment in Russia in 
1993 was only 47.8 percent of the 1991 level. Over that period, 
the production of aircraft and helicopters dropped by a factor 
of 3.8, armored tank equipment by over four-fifths, ammunition 
by a factor of 4.5, and military production in the electronics 
industry by a factor of 5.4. The main reason for the drop in 
the pace of military production is the lack of financing. At 
the end of 1993, the state owed the military industry about one 
trillion rubles for already manufactured products.

Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov, the president's 
representative in the Razoruzheniye (Disarmament) state owned 
company (and former commander of the joint CIS forces), told 
Interfax that if Russia's defense industries continue to be 
neglected as they are now, a political party could be set up 
which would lobby for the industries. This idea was advanced at 
a recent conference of the industries. 
  Shaposhnikov did not object to cuts in military spending but 
said that "the principles of sufficient reason as well as 
reasonable sufficiency" had to be observed. 
  In his view, the proposed cut (to less than one fifth of the 
1993 figure) of spending for military contracts might harm the 
scientific and industrial potential of the country. 
Shaposhnikov thought that the rocketry, air force and other 
services using high technologies could be the worst hit. 
  In a more intelligent approach, Shaposhnikov thought, "the 
number of design boards and factories specializing in 
development and manufacture of the same products" could be cut. 
This kind of competition would make it possible to preserve and 
consolidate the most efficient producers while less fortunate 
competitors could turn to other activities, probably for 
peaceful purposes. 
  The defense industries must have better guidelines, he 
thought. Four specific state programs had to be adopted, of 
weapons production, reduction and utilization of non-promising 
production lines, conversion to peaceful uses and weapons export. 
  "Even though I am with a mediator organization engaged in 
sales of weapons, I don't think it fair that military hardware 
producers cannot participate in exporting their products. They 
must have the right of direct access to the world market so as 
to enable them to use part of their proceeds for their immediate 
needs and increase the national budget revenue by paying taxes," 
Shaposhnikov said.

<F P=106> [Valeriy Baberdin and Aleksandr Yegorov report under </F>
"Postscriptum: Events and Commentaries" rubric: "Requiem for 
Defense Industry"] 
  [Text] A gathering of leaders of defense enterprises, 
economists, trade union figures, and representatives of labor 
collective councils took place in Moscow last Saturday. They 
discussed the seriousness of the situation which has taken shape 
in the defense industry and adopted an appeal to the government 
in connection with the draft state budget for 1994. The tangle 
of problems here seems already to have exceeded its critical 
mass. 
  As is known, the first state budget drafting stage ended 
with 
the government adopting a "compromise" version. It is already 
clear, however, that this "compromise" will not bring 
appeasement but will merely increase the intensity of the 
struggle in parliament. 
  Many specialists doubt the possibility of keeping the budget 
deficit below 10 percent (61.5 trillion rubles [R]) and reducing 
the average monthly rate of inflation to 5-7 percent by the end 
of 1994. The reluctance to improve the tax system and the 
exhaustion of other sources of budget revenues are just a few of 
the reasons for this. This is why the drastic cutting of the 
expenditure part from R237 trillion to R182 trillion only 
appears to confirm the resoluteness of the government's 
aspirations but does not actually do so. Such a budget will 
hardly be implemented. 
  What, then, will happen? Sectors and regions that have 
adapted to the market will find nonbudgetary money and will 
extricate themselves from the 1994 noose by redistributing 
financial resources. Only budget-funded organizations will be 
unable to do this -- i.e., the defense enterprises again, for 
which the draft budget has prepared "tertiary conversion," which 
is certainly the last conversion and which they will not 
withstand. 
  It will clearly be impossible to fit the defense industry 
into "Trishka's coat," even if we were to call on the assistance 
of the most skilled masters. For it is impossible to finance 
the 5,000 research and development tasks currently under way 
with the present R3.5 trillion. Even if we cut all the 
longer-term tasks, leaving specific ones relating to new models 
of weapons (there are approximately 600 of these), this sum will 
suffice only for about 10 particularly important ones on whose 
completion the country's strategic security depends. 
  Together with the sum allocated to purchasing VVT [expansion 
unknown], the planned budget appropriations can provide 
approximately 300,000 people with work. (In the United States 
the military sector of the economy has 3 million employees.) 
This is tantamount to the defense industry's final degradation. 
As a result, the capacities left unloaded will, at best, be 
gradually "assimilated" into civilian industry or, most likely, 
will come to a halt altogether, and specialists estimate that 
approximately 15 million people will move from the sphere of 
physical production to the position of unemployed or partially 
unemployed people. 
  On behalf of the military-industrial complex enterprise 
leaders and the chairmen of trade unions and labor collective 
councils, A. Shulunov, president of the Defense Enterprises 
Assistance League, and A. Breusov, chairman of the Association 
of Trade Unions of Defense Sectors of Industry, put a proposal 
to the government to take immediate measures to ensure the 
efficiency of the credit-financial system, and to take control 
of structural transformations in industry by amending the 
present statute with the formation of financial-industrial 
groups. Within the very near future, the appeal states, it is 
necessary to approve Russia's defense program and adopt the 
Russian Federation Law "On Military Production," as well as a 
new version of the Law "On Conversion."

<F P=106> [Report by Yu. Konorov followed by editorial office note: </F>
"Defense Industry Has Stopped and Threatens To Go Out Onto the 
Street"] 
  [Text] The two first Saturdays of March have become truly 
"black" ones for specialists of the military-industrial complex. 
Perturbed at the draft state budget for 1994, which dooms the 
defense industry to definitive collapse, the leaders and members 
of the league for assisting defense enterprises held emergency 
conferences. There was reason to be perturbed: Whereas last 
year the budget provided 7.5 trillion rubles [R] for the army's 
needs, and allocated R6.5 trillion, this year instead of the 
necessary R84 trillion the government intends to give only R37 
trillion. Some R4,478 billion will be needed to fulfill 
conversion programs, but not a kopek is being allocated. 
  That is why members of the government, to which those 
gathered in the Palace of Labor Great Hall appealed, were 
invited for 12 March. The planned reduction in defense 
expenditure means not only the complete stoppage of the majority 
of enterprises but also the birth of a 5 million-strong army of 
unemployed. The country will be deprived of its industrial 
potential and Russia's national security and future will be 
threatened. 
  Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin assured those 
assembled that the absence of representatives of the Russian 
Federation Government in the hall does not mean the government's 
disregard for the sector's needs. Recognizing some of the 
criticism heard as fair, Andrey Kokoshin noted that plenty of 
edicts and decrees have been adopted, the trouble is that there 
is no mechanism for their operation. In particular, there is 
permission for trading in arms but bureaucratic obstacles are 
cancelling out all the efforts of the defense industry leaders 
to extricate themselves from their debts. 
  The Russian Government has surrounded defense with excessive 
taxes, putting it on the edge of survival, while at the same 
time for reasons unknown to anyone and in accordance with 
inexplicable rules individual joint-stock companies and concerns 
receive benefits when being taxed. 
  The participants in the conference adopted the text of a 
decree including specific measures to normalize the situation in 
the sector. In particular it was suggested that Russia's 
defense program be approved as soon as possible and that the 
Russian Federation law "on military production" be adopted. 
<H5>  From the Editorial Office: </H5>
  It has become known to the editorial office that after the 
appeal by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev to the Russian 
president the head of state imposed a resolution instructing 
that the draft budget be revised. It seems expedient to create 
an independent commission which would control the entire 
mechanism of the fulfillment of edicts and decrees already in 
operation.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Reform continues in the country. Today, the state 
company for the export and import of arms, Rosvooruzheniye 
[Russian Arms], held a presentation for journalists. The former 
USSR never traded in arms, but simply delivered them according 
to agreements. So there has only been trade proper since 1991. 
But in this sphere, liberalization has led to a situation where 
dozens of Russian firms are tendering for contracts to supply 
India with artillery shells, all selling the product of the same 
factory. And the one who got the contract was the one who 
knocked down his price one and one-half times. 
  By setting up Rosvooruzheniye, the government has created a 
state monopoly on arms trading. But this does not mean that 
enterprises are deprived of the opportunity to be involved in 
foreign trade -- simply that this is now done under the guidance 
of, or, to be more precise, while observing Rosvooruzheniye's 
price controls. One of the company's main activities will be 
investment of profits from promising research work -- at present 
3-5 percent of the value of a contract. It will also receive 
additional income, where the latter has been successful. The 
arms trade is a subtle business.

<F P=106> [Leonid Zavarskiy report: "`Rosvooruzheniye' Company Takes </F>
Off. Russian Arms Trade Centralized"] 
  [Text] The existence of a number of foreign economic 
structures involved in the sale of Russian arms has caused a 
fragmentation of Russia's efforts on the world arms market, has 
undermined the exporters' authority among the customers, and has 
somewhat disorganized government policy. This prompted last 
November the creation of a single government structure to export 
arms, ammunition, military equipment, and components -- the 
"Rosvooruzheniye" state company. Presently the company is 
staging its presentation to mark the start of its international 
operations. 
  "The USSR and, later, Russia did not sell arms -- they only 
supplied them to allies within the framework of the former 
political course," Lieutenant General Viktor Samoylov, general 
director of the "Rosvooruzheniye" state company, said at a press 
conference yesterday. He also stressed that the company 
entrusted to him "is not afraid of accusations of being a 
monopoly," because in the past two years attempts by a multitude 
of sellers to trade in arms have failed. Only a single state 
company, such as "Rosvooruzheniye," will be able to do so 
successfully. 
  The "Rosvooruzheniye" state arms and military hardware 
export 
and import company was set up 25 November of last year in 
accordance with the Russian president's edict No. 507 on the 
basis of the "Oboroneksport" foreign trade association, the 
"Spetsvneshtekhnika" foreign trade company, and the Main 
Administration for Cooperation, to act as their successor. 
Under presidential edicts, Viktor Samoylov was appointed the 
company's director, and Air Force Marshal Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov 
was named the president's representative on its board. 
  "Rosvooruzheniye's" entirely new objective is to invest 
private and government money into Russian military-industrial 
enterprises to create under contract weapons models that are 
most sought after on the world market. All Russia's largest 
defense enterprises will continue to be involved in foreign 
economic activity, but they will act under contract with the 
company. Arms will be delivered to foreign buyers out of the 
excess reserves of military hardware stored at 
military-industrial enterprises; revenues from the sales will 
not be transferred to the budget as was the case formerly, but 
will be received by the producer (with a deduction of 3-5 
percent commission fees to be kept by "Rosvooruzheniye"), who 
will pay taxes to the state. It is well known that formerly the 
state allocated arms sales revenues between enterprises at its 
discretion. 
  At the initial stage of "Rosvooruzheniye's" activity, its 
deals will be licensed by the Foreign Economic Relations 
Ministry; later the company itself will be authorized to do so. 
At present a special government decree and a new draft law on 
military-technical cooperation are being drawn up to set forth a 
new procedure for military exports. Tomorrow KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
will report the company's activity in greater detail.

Leskov under the heading: "If Svobodnyy-18 Becomes a New 
Baykonur, Every Stone at the Space Launch Site Will Be Worth 
More Than a Diamond"] 
  [Text] Boris Reznik, IZVESTIYA 
  Amur Oblast--This base was supposed to be very secret. 
Like many others, it had a number without any identifiable 
meaning added to its name--Svobodnyy-18. But almost everybody in 
Amur Oblast called it simply and plainly the "rocket city." A 
mysterious and apparently very serious military unit was 
stationed here. 
  At the time of conversion and across-the-board cutbacks in 
the armed forces, the situation at Svobodnyy-18 became so bad 
that its troubles spilled far outside the bounds of the secret 
territory. This was no longer a "rocket bulwark of the 
motherland;" the servicemen who stayed suffered together with 
their families from poor food supply, inadequate heating in 
their homes, and other everyday problems. 
  Now the oblast has received the news that the government has 
instructed appropriate organizations to develop a project for 
the construction of a space launch site in the Russian Far East, 
and the base for the "Amur Baykonur" will be Svobodnyy-18. The 
base's facilities have already been transferred to the military 
space forces. 
  Head of the Amur Oblast administration Vladimir Polevanov 
confirmed a few days ago in a public address the seriousness of 
the government's intent to launch space vessels from the 
territory entrusted to him. As AMURSKAYA PRAVDA reported, the 
Amur governor took advantage of Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Andrey Kozyrev's recent visit to the oblast to send two 
memoranda to Boris Yeltsin. In one, B. Polevanov invited the 
president to visit Amur Oblast, and in the other he asked the 
president on behalf of Amur Oblast residents to speed up the 
signing of the edict on the construction of a space launch site 
in the designated area. He even made a suggestion to Boris 
Nikolayevich on what to call the future facility: "Svobodnyy 
Russian Space Launch Center." 
  Meanwhile, oblast residents are not unanimous in accepting 
the need to build a space launch site here. A lot of concerns in 
this respect are being voiced by representatives of the 
"greens," environmental science specialists, State Duma 
deputies, and ordinary citizens. At their request Leonid 
Korotkov, a Russian parliament deputy from Amur Oblast, began 
with the help of experts a careful study of the current 
environmental situation in the area of all three space launch 
sites that existed on the territory of the former USSR. So far 
the information he has collected is extremely discouraging. The 
oblast public is waiting for detailed data on potential changes 
in the ecological situation in connection with the space launch 
site construction. Depending on the results, the president will 
be informed of the true reaction of Amur Oblast residents.

  The idea of building a launch site equal to Baykonur 
has been discussed increasingly often lately. The reason is 
simple--Russia and Kazakhstan still cannot agree on mutually 
acceptable terms for utilizing the largest space complex in the 
world built in the Aral steppes. 
  As to construction of a space launch station in the area of 
Blagoveshchensk, where the disbanded rocket forces used to be 
stationed, the main argument in its favor is its geographic 
location. Although Svobodnyy-18 is located on a more northern 
latitude than Baykonur, it is still in the southernmost region 
of the territory of Russia. Launch site proximity to the equator 
saves fuel in the process of putting the craft into orbit and in 
all countries is considered one of the most important factors in 
choosing a launch site. In confidential conversations officials 
note that the new launch site will open the way for Russia to 
enter the fast developing market of space services in Southeast 
Asia. 
  It is believed in the Russian Space Agency [RSA], however, 
that these pluses are offset by Amur Oblast's considerable 
distance from space infrastructure facilities. According to RSA 
Deputy General Director Boris Ostroumov, construction of a major 
space launch site in the Far East would be tantamount to 
building it out of diamonds. Given the paucity of the Russian 
space budget, a realistic approach, in the RSA's opinion, would 
be to preserve and maintain existing facilities. There is still 
hope of reaching an accommodation with Kazakhstan. On 10 March a 
Russian delegation, headed by RSA General Director Yuriy Koptev, 
left for another round of negotiations in Almaty. There are also 
technical capabilities for expanding the functions of the 
northern space launch site in Plesetsk, although each start from 
there requires 10-15 percent more fuel as compared to Baykonur. 
The extra costs would be greatest in launching heavy rockets of 
the Proton and Energiya type from Plesetsk. 
  At this point the question of building a space launch site 
in 
Amur Oblast is far from finalized. The initiative for this idea 
comes from the military, which for quite understandable reasons 
would like to continue utilizing the former rocket base. As of 
today there is only an instruction to study the technical 
proposal for construction of the space launch site, but 
definitely not a government order for the project design. The 
situation will possibly become clearer after 14 March, when a 
Ministry of Defense commission headed by Colonel General 
Vladimir Ivanov, head of the military space troops, will visit 
the site of the Svobodnyy-18 military base. The Ministry of 
Defense prefers not make any comment until it examines the 
facilities of the potential space launch site.

  [Text] A senior official of the Russian Space Agency (RSA) 
in an interview with INTERFAX has described as groundless a 
recent statement by Commander of Military Space Forces (MSF) 
General Vladimir Ivanov about Moscow's plans to build a new 
cosmodrome (space center) in the Far East by the year 2000. 
  He said that building such a facility was not MSF's job but 
that of a special branch of the industry which is in Ukraine and 
elsewhere after the break-up of the Soviet Union. 
  On the prospect of a Far Eastern project, the RSA official 
said that although his agency had no objections, billions of 
rubles would have to be raised to implement it by the year 2000, 
something that Moscow could not afford at the moment.

"the Lachin humanitarian corridor between Armenia and Karabakh 
must exist." 
  After the meeting with Ararktsyan in Kazakhskiy, Rasul 
Guliyev said that Azerbaijan categorically will recognize the 
so-called Karabakh Republic. However, the head of the

  [Text] Baku (MARCH 15) TURAN--"At the present situation, 
the ceasefire is necessary for Azerbaijan, because Azerbaijan 
needs a respite", said Zardusht Alizade, the Azerbaijani Social 
Democratic Party's Central Committee member commenting on the 
results of the talks between parliament leaders of Azerbaijan 
and Armenia. 
  According to Alizade, the actual outcome of the agreements 
and the negotiation process will depend mostly on the Russias 
position. 
  Touching on the question about the status of Upper Karabakh 
[Nagorno-Karabakh] Alizade said, "We support the idea of giving 
the status of autonomy to Upper Karabakh...in fact, Armenian 
civilians do not live there, for the most part... [ellipses as 
received] Since the ethnic cleansing of Azeris from that 
territory, fascist-military control was established in Upper 
Karabakh." He also noted that the autonomy does not pose a 
threat to the integrity and sovereignty of Azerbaijan. "It does 
not mean that federalisation of the republic will take place; 
Azerbaijan will remain a united republic", he added. 
  The Azerbaijani National Independence Party's leader, Etibar 
Mamedov, said that he was not yet acquainted with the results of 
the talks. 
  "I am not yet aware the concrete conditions of the 
agreement. 
One thing is known. The Armenian party has demanded to a 
guarantee prior to its withdrawal. If they mean that this 
guarantee includes the deployment of the Russian army in the 
territory, we are categorically against that and we shall not 
give them such an opportunity", said Etibar Mamedov. In his 
opinion, "one country cannot solve this problem as a mediator. 
Moreover, Russia has its own interests in this matter." 
  According to Mamedov, the question of autonomy of 
Nagorno-Karabakh could be solved on the basis of international 
norms, i.e. on the level of self-governance without the 
representation of a state. "It is impossible to have a state in 
the state", noted he.

  [Text] Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of the Ukrainian 
Popular Rukh, intends to run for the presidency in the 26 June, 
1994 elections, officials in the Rukh press service told 
INTERFAX-Ukraine. 
  A final decision on this will be made by the Rukh National 
Convention scheduled for 16 April. 
  The incumbent President Leonid Kravchuk said originally that 
he would not run for presidency because he disagreed with the 
timing of the elections. He said that if a new parliament was 
not elected within the month while the president was engaged in 
an electoral campaign the country might find itself "without 
authorities." 
  Another possible candidate, former prime minister Leonid 
Kuchma, intends to announce his decision later. 
  Kravchuk won over 60 percent of the votes and Chornovil, 
nearly 28 percent in Ukraine's first presidential elections in 
December 1991. Kuchma did not run then.

<F P=106> ["Statement by the Ukrainian Presidential and Cabinet of </F>
Ministers Press Service"; date not given] 
  [Text] Some Ukrainian and foreign (predominantly Russian) 
mass media have recently carried abundant information on the 
Crimean leadership's declared orientation toward Crimea's 
joining the "ruble zone" and even on the accord on this matter 
allegedly reached between Kiev and Simferopol. In reality, 
however, such assertions are nothing more than political 
speculation. 
  Questions of granting the Crimea the most extensive economic 
powers will be discussed. Regarding the question of state 
financial policy, including the introduction of a particular 
currency regime, it is exclusively the jurisdiction of Ukraine's 
state organs, not of individual administrative and territorial 
formations. This is, in particular, stressed in Ukraine's 
Supreme Council decree of 24 February 1994 "On the Status of the 
Crimean Autonomous Republic in Accordance With Ukraine's Current 
Constitution and Legislation."

  [Text] Mykola Mykhalchenko, head of the Ukrainian 
president's Internal Policy Service, stated today in a national 
radio interview that Kiev can no longer make concessions to 
separatists in Crimea. Their games could lead to an Abkhaz-style 
development of events. It is better to stop the separatists now 
than to establish order by military force later, he said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Data on Ukrainian Weapons Trade in </F>
1993"] 
  [Text] The number of conventional weapons that remained on 
Ukrainian soil after the breakup of the Soviet Union had to be 
reduced in three stages. Between 1991 and 1993, 25 percent of 
all weapons -- 531 tanks, 422 infantry vehicles, and 140 
aircraft -- had to be eliminated. 
  In 1993, the total export of weapons abroad stood at $29 
million, while the total export of goods -- at $5.508 billion 
[as published]. The specific proportion of weapons exported as 
part of total exports is 25 percent. 
  As for Ukraine, it sold tanks to Slovakia and Russia for the 
sum of $575,000; aircraft, including satellites and 
missile-carriers, for $5,199,000, and radio guidance equipment 
for $3,651,000. In addition, military and rescue vessels were 
sold to Russia and Greece for a total of $721,000. Bombs, 
grenades, torpedoes, missiles, and cartridges made up the 
greatest portion of military exports ($9,772,000). Ukraine 
sold ships as scrap-iron to Turkey, Russia, and Britain for 
$579,000. 
  It is difficult to comment on the benefits of this trade for 
Ukraine, because there is no official data on the total amount 
of weapons traded. We learned from sources close to the 
president that Ukraine sold 80 tanks. We know that the latest 
model T-80T, which is being produced in Kharkov, costs more than 
$2 million. The cost of this tank as scrap-iron is $4,000 (one 
tonne of scrap-iron sells for $100). 
  We would like to add that in 1992, the Commercial Center 
within the Ukrainian Defense Ministry traded 13 military vessels 
as scrap-iron. The Ukrainian state coffers received only 5 
percent from the sale of this scrap-iron. The Commercial Center 
was later disbanded.

  [Text] In an interview for the foreign press, the 
commander of Ukraine's Naval Forces, Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, 
said that our state does not consider the possibility of 
transferring its part of the Black Sea Fleet ships to Russia to 
repay the debt for oil and gas deliveries. The commander of 
Ukraine's Naval Forces said that the protocol signed in 
Massandra [in the Crimea] was a protocol on intentions. It was 
never regarded as a way out of the situation. According to 
Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, that question was studied and rejected.

<F P=106> ["Immediate release" from the Estonian Ministry of Foreign </F>
Affairs in Tallinn dated 15 March: "Estonia Accepts April Date 
for Next Round of Talks With Russia; Asks European Union To 
Mediate Under European Stability Pact"] 
  [Text] The eighteenth round of Estonian-Russian 
negotiations will take place in Moscow April 5-6. Despite 
numerous difficult to explain statements made by Russian leaders 
regarding the breaking off of talks and the postponing of the 
agreed-upon date for final withdrawal, Estonia decided yesterday 
to accept the April date offered by Russia for the 18th round of 
talks. 
  At the last round, held March 1-2 outside Tallinn, Russia 
backed away from August 31, 1994, the agreed upon date for final 
withdrawal of the 2,600 ex-Soviet troops remaining in Estonia. 
In addition, Russia demanded further conditions for withdrawal 
and did not propose a date for the next round. 
  International reaction to Russia's moves was swift and 
strong, unanimously supporting Estonia's contention that Russian 
troops must leave, unconditionally, by August 31. Western 
reaction played an important role in Russia's current decision 
to continue the talks and to abide by the withdrawal date. 
  Estonian negotiating team leader, Ambassador Vaeino Reinart, 
began consultations in Brussels today. He will call upon the 
European Union to help mediate Estonian-Russian negotiations 
within the framework of the European Stability Pact.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 15, BNS -- Russia promised to start 
removal of nuclear fuel from the two reactors in Paldiski on 
April 6, Environment Minister Andres Tarand announced at the 
government press conference today. 
  "We hope the three-month operation really starts when 
promised," Tarand said. 
  The government today set concrete tasks to several 
ministries 
to guarantee safety of the operation. The environment minister 
told BNS the Cabinet is now "organizationally ready" for the 
removal of fuel. 
  "It is most unlikely that an accident should occur in 
Paldiski, but we must be prepared for any eventuality," Tarand 
said. "For example, a fire may break out, which may involve 
leakage of radioactive substances, and in this case people will 
have to be evacuated. Estonia must guarantee the safety of the 
population." 
  The environment minister said the government laid main 
responsibility for safety on the Rescue Department, the 
Environment Ministry, the Estonian Railways, and the Economics 
Ministry. 
  "The dismantling of the two nuclear reactors in Paldiski 
does 
not directly concern Estonia, since we lack specialists for this 
and, besides, Russia regards the reactors as a state secret," 
Tarand said. "We are, however, interested in everything that 
concerns the removal of fuel." 
  Tarand claimed Estonia and Russia haven't yet agreed on what 
is to become of Paldiski after the fuel has been removed. 
  "What remains is the shells of the reactors, purification 
systems, and some solid and liquid nuclear waste," the 
environment minister said. "Russia asks for five years to 
eliminate them, which we think is too long. On the other hand, 
we cannot make too stiff demands (on Russia), since Estonia 
lacks a radioactive waste depository and the cost of building 
one would be enormous. To resolve the issue, probably pressure 
from third countries is needed." 
  Russia plans to use new, TK-18 type containers for the 
removal of nuclear fuel from Paldiski. This is the first time 
they will be used in such operations. 
  Tarand said he has heard rumors that the containers "were a 
couple of weeks ago shipped off to Estonia from Vladivostok or 
some other faraway place," but that they "were stuck halfway." 
  "The new containers are a better alternative if only because 
they haven't previously been used for transporting nuclear fuel 
and they are not radioactive," Tarand said.

  [Excerpt] Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho arrived in 
Estonia today on a two-day visit. This morning he held a 
lengthy meeting with Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar. Uku 
Toom asked Toivo Klaar, the head of the Foreign Ministry's 
policy department, to sum up what was discussed. 
  [Klaar] It was a good meeting. Estonian-Finnish economic 
relations as well as Estonian-Finnish political relations were 
discussed, and it was acknowledged that there are no problems. 
Things are on an upward curve. And generally, Estonian-Finnish 
relations cannot be much better. Prime Minister Aho stated that 
President Martti Ahtisaari will visit Estonia, hopefully before 
the summer. 
  We also discussed the issue of a gas pipeline and the Via 
Baltica highway. These are both issues of a great interest to 
the two countries. Finland is of course more interested in 
having the gas pipeline to Estonia passing through Finland 
[words indistinct]. 
  We also discussed the European Union and any Estonian 
progress in free-trade talks. We discussed cooperation in this 
respect. Naturally, the Russian troop withdrawal issue was also 
discussed and Prime Minister Aho stated once again that Finland 
supports and will continue to support a prompt troop withdrawal.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 15, BNS -- Finnish Prime Minister Esko 
Aho, who today began a visit to Estonia, met at noon with his 
Estonian counterpart Mart Laar. 
  The premiers stated at the meeting that the relations 
between 
the two countries are very good, Jaakko Laajava, head of the 
Finnish Foreign Ministry political department, told the press. 
  Aho and Laar discussed at the meeting the withdrawal of 
Russian troops from Estonia and Latvia. Laajava said Aho 
expressed hope that Russian forces will be pulled out from the 
two Baltic countries as quickly as possible. The withdrawal of 
Russian troops is important not only from the point of view of 
Estonian-Russian relations, but also for the security of the 
Baltic Sea countries, Laajava stated. 
  The Finnish diplomat said the premiers touched on border 
guard and customs cooperation between the two countries, the 
construction of a gas pipeline linking the Nordic and the Baltic 
countries, and the Via Baltica highway project. The Baltic 
states' association with the European Union also came under 
discussion. 
  Toivo Klaar, head of the Estonian Foreign Ministry political 
department, added that the premiers touched on the problems 
connected with the small capacity of the bridge linking Narva 
with Jaanilinn (Ivangorod), which complicates the crossing of 
the control line between Estonia and Russia. 
  The Finnish premier and culture minister attend today the 
inauguration of the new premises of the Finnish Institute in 
Tallinn. Aho then departs for Tartu, where he is scheduled to 
meet with the municipal government and the rector of Tartu 
University. The Finnish premier delivers a speech at the 
university and tours the sights of the city. 
  Aho is scheduled to visit Narva tomorrow. The program of the 
visit includes meetings with members of the municipal government 
and the city council, and tours of the city and the Baltic 
Electric Power Station. 
  The Finnish premier is accompanied by Finnish Ambassador to 
Estonia Jaakko Kaurinkoski; his aide, Pekka Huhtaniemi; Laajava; 
and other high-level officials. 
  Aho leaves Estonia on Wednesday [16 March]. He gives a press 
conference at the Tallinn Airport before his departure.

  [Text] The Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho began a two-day 
official visit to Estonia on Tuesday. During his talks with 
Estonian leaders the subject of a natural gas network stretching 
from the Nordic countries via the Baltic states down into Europe 
was raised by the Estonian side. Finance for the project would, 
it is hoped, come from the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development. Prime Minister Aho said that Finland was prepared 
to take part in such a project. We have this report: 
  [Correspondent] During the first day of his visit to 
Estonia, 
Prime Minister Aho delivered a speech in English at the 
University of Tartu. It is almost 30 years to the day since the 
late President Urho Kekkonen addressed an audience in the same 
place and spoke Estonian. In his speech Mr. Aho wanted to 
signal to the Estonians that the Baltic states should strengthen 
cooperation among themselves; relying on the Nordic countries 
for support was not enough on its own. Another very important 
message in the speech was that Finland had not made a mistake by 
adopting a restrained realpolitik during the process of 
independence in the Baltic Republics. 
  On Tuesday morning Mr. Aho had talks with his Estonian 
counterpart Mart Laar. The prime minister discussed the rapid 
development of trade between Finland and Estonia. Finland is 
currently Estonia's most important trading partner. Within the 
context of privatization in Estonia, the countries are preparing 
an agreement on the return of property under which Estonian 
citizens will under certain conditions regain ownership of their 
former property in Finland and Finns will have the same right in 
Estonia. 
  Estonia also brought up the subject of natural gas supplies 
from Norway via Sweden and Finland to the Baltic states and on 
southwards to Poland and Germany. The topic was also discussed 
a few days ago in a telephone conversation between the Estonian 
and Polish prime ministers. Estonia wants the Nordic countries 
to be involved in what would be an expensive project to help it 
becone independent of gas supplies supplied by Russia. 
According to the Finnish prime minister, the project would not 
be utopian. For the Nordic countries, it would be very 
important both strategically and in terms of energy policy. Mr. 
Aho believes that a decision on the natural gas project will 
emerge, but he was not willing to guess when that might happen. 
  The Finnish and Estonian prime ministers are also due to 
discuss the recent strain in relations between Estonia and 
Russia over the timetable for the withdrawal of Russian troops 
from Estonia.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 15, BNS -- Assembly Party leader Tiit 
Vahi yesterday spoke about Pro Patria as future coalition 
partner of his party. 
  Vahi said in an interview to BNS that "with regard to the 
taxation system, we are of the opinion that the taxation policy 
of the future coalition between the Assembly Party and Pro 
Patria will pay more attention to the interests of enterprises 
than the present policy." 
  Vahi told BNS he attaches great importance to future 
cooperation between the two parties. 
  The Assembly Party recently proposed coalition talks to Pro 
Patria. The Pro Patria parliament faction plans to discuss the 
offer on Tuesday [15 March]. 
  "(Prime Minister) Mart Laar's unwillingness to collaborate 
with the Assembly Party doesn't mean that the entire Pro Patria 
declines to cooperate with the Assembly Party," Vahi said in a 
comment on the statement Laar made on Saturday. 
  Laar, who is Pro Patria's chairman, told BNS on Saturday 
that 
the implementation of Assembly Party policies would send taxes 
skyrocketing and put a stop to radical economic reform. It is 
difficult for Pro Patria to find points of contact with "red 
directors" and former collective farm managers, he claimed. 
  "Pro Patria takes no interest in collaboration with the 
specialists of the Assembly Party administration who granted 
multimillion-kroon interest-free risk credits and whose 
thoughtless guarantees have caused the state damage to the tune 
of over 100 million kroons," the premier said. 
  The editorial in today's issue of the Hommikuleht daily 
regards Laar's statement as an attempt to foil the forthcoming 
meeting with the Assembly Party leader. 
  A Hommikuleht commentator voiced the opinion that Laar 
dreads 
Vahi "like lightning," since the leader of the Assembly Party 
has been making overtures to the Pro Patria wing that has 
distanced itself from Laar: "The premier has reason to fear that 
he may drop the reins of Pro Patria, which he holds not too 
securely, anyway." 
  Vahi claimed that the Assembly Party program largely 
coincides with that of Pro Patria. The party, however, strives 
for a more decentralized taxation policy, elimination of 
turnover tax levied on entrepreneurs who import goods, and 
changing of the taxation system concerning taxes levied on 
farmers, Vahi said commenting on the differences between the two 
parties' programs. 
  "I think that, if we solve these questions, the actual tax 
burden of enterprises will decrease," Vahi said. He maintained 
that the taxation policy of the future Assembly Party-Pro Patria 
coalition should be more enterprise-friendly. 
  The Assembly Party led by former Prime Minister Tiit Vahi is 
at present in opposition. Opinion polls indicate, however, that 
it holds the top position among Estonian political parties. The 
party also won the elections to the Tallinn City Council last 
autumn.

  [Excerpts] Armenian Vice President Gagik Arutyunyan today 
received General Andrey Nikolayev, commander in chief of Russian 
border troops. 
  The Armenian presidential press service reported that the 
Armenian vice president and the commander in chief of the border 
troops examined matters relating to the joint defense of state 
borders. They specifically discussed the enlistment of Armenian 
citizens in military service in the Russian border guard units 
stationed in Armenia, the joint defense of borders, and matters 
pertaining to legal procedures regulating the joint defense of 
the borders. 
  Armenian Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan today also received 
General Andrey Nikolayev, commander in chief of Russian border 
troops. The prime minister stressed the importance of the 
signed documents on the enlistment of Armenian citizens in the 
Russian border troops and considered it a significant step in 
the development of Armenian-Russian cooperation. 
  Matters relating to the joint defense of Armenia's state 
borders, including the financial, economic, and technical 
aspects, were discussed during the meeting. 
  Vazgen Sargisyan [Armenian state minister and commander of 
border guards] and Andrey Nikolayev signed an agreement at noon 
today. You can hear the details in Gevorg Nazaryan's report: 
  [Begin recording] [Nazaryan] An agreement was signed today 
on 
the enlistment of Armenian citizens in the Russian border guard 
units stationed in Armenia and on regulations on military 
service. It was signed by General Andrey Nikolayev, commander in 
chief of Russian border troops, and Armenian State Minister 
Vazgen Sargisyan. 
  This is how the signatories assessed the document after the 
signing ceremony. Let us first hear Andrey Nikolayev. [passage 
omitted] 
  Now let us hear State Minister Vazgen Sargisyan. 
  [Sargisyan] This is a very important agreement, especially 
for the soldiers who are currently serving on the borders, for 
the Armenian and Russian soldiers who are jointly defending 
Armenia's and, in effect, CIS' borders. The soldiers were 
waiting for it. This agreement will greatly facilitate their 
service and clarify what we and Russia should be doing. 
Therefore, it is highly important. 
  [Nazaryan] Let me add that Russian Ambassador to Armenia 
Vladimir Stupishin; Davit Shahnazaryan, the Armenian president's 
ambassador on special missions and acting head of the State 
Directorate for National Security of the Armenian Republic; and 
other officials were present at the signing ceremony. [end

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by Babken Ararktsyan, chairman of </F>
the Armenian Supreme Council, with Grigor Geuzelyan; in Yerevan 
on 14 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Geuzelyan] The Babken Ararktsyan-Rasul Guliyev 
meeting continues to be the focus of attention of reporters, 
politicians, and public [words indistinct]. The news conference 
held by the chairmen of the Armenian and Azerbaijani parliaments 
provided the most documentary evidence about that meeting. 
  Considering the importance of the event and broad audience, 
I 
have eliminated the reporters' questions during the news 
conference, and I thought it appropriate to quote Ararktsyan's 
words as completely as possible. 
  [Ararktsyan] A meeting took place between me and Rasul 
Guliyev, chairman of the Azerbaijani parliament, on the 
Idzhevan-Kazakh road on 12 March. This was our first meeting. 
During our first telephone conversation, I congratulated Mr. 
Guliyev on being elected chairman of the parliament. We had 
agreed at the time to meet at an opportune time. The 
opportunity arose at this time. I think that the talks were 
constructive in nature, and we agreed to discuss matters 
pertaining to the future, and basically not to brood over, or 
analyze, or examine past events. I could say that basically the 
talks centered around these matters. Naturally, we could not 
have delved into details and examine details. Therefore, we 
divided the talks in two: global matters, including the 
approach of the two sides to the Karabakh problem. Also, on our 
part we had our own specific proposals, which I will inform you 
about. 
  As regards the first problem, the sides confirmed once again 
that they favor a peaceful resolution of the problem, and that 
the establishment of a stable and guaranteed peace in the region 
is a priority. And only then start negotiations on the status 
of Nagorno-Karabakh. This is in conformity with CSCE Minsk 
Group's initiatives which are enshrined in the schedule on 
urgent measures worked out in Vienna. 
  The next one was that Nagorno-Karabakh should fully 
participate in the settlement process of the problem. As you 
know, in this case too, the Vienna schedule notes that 
Nagorno-Karabakh is a party to the conflict, and that this in 
itself does not imply any political consequences. 
  Next, the sides agreed that international organizations, in 
particular CSCE, should take part in the peace process, and 
various countries -- as you know Russia has its own proposals 
and initiatives -- could come forward with their own initiatives. 
  That the Lachin humanitarian corridor should always be 
functional was also raised. 
  I again repeat, these were the global issues raised, we have 
not gone into detail, which is the work of the diplomats. 
  These were the main global issues on which we (?agreed). 
  In addition to that, our side, the Armenian side, guided by 
the fact that the atmosphere of mutual confidence should be 
restored [words indistinct], made a unilateral proposal. 
Specifically, that Armenia is ready to make its communication 
routes available for transportation of (?certain) goods from 
Azerbaijan to Nakhichevan. Let me say that this is not a new 
proposal. Our government had proposed to Turkey more than a 
year ago that Armenia is ready to make its communications routes 
available for the transportation of freight to Nakhichevan. 
This is a reply to the claims of certain circles that 
Nakhichevan is allegedly also under blockade. 
  The second concrete proposal, which was made for the first 
time, was that Armenia is unilaterally ready, without any 
preconditions, to make its communications routes available to 
bring (?fuel) and power to Nakhichevan. We are ready to enter 
into technical talks even this very day or tomorrow to realize 
this plan. 
  These are in general the issues raised [words indistinct]. 
As regards these last two proposals, the Azerbaijani side will 
study them and reply [words indistinct]. I repeat that we have 
placed no preconditions as regards these concrete proposals, and 
(?they) could be implemented very quickly [words indistinct] 
  [Geuzelyan] The chairman of the Armenian Supreme Council was 
asked many questions. Let me mention only one, the most 
interesting one. Asked if he believes that peace could be 
achieved this year, Mr. Ararktsyan said: 
  [Ararktsyan] I do not want to engage in predictions. I am 
trying to do concrete work as much as possible. It is clear 
that this is the most important issue and we should exert all 
efforts to attain peace, of course, an honorable and just peace.

  [Text] Stepanakert, March 15 (SNARK)--Karen Baburyan, 
acting as a Chairman of the Karabakh Supreme Soviet, told 
journalists at his press-conference in Stepanakert neither any 
decisions nor the concrete plans on the Karabakh conflict 
regulation could be realized without participation of the 
Karabakh side. 
  Thus, Mr. Baburyan considers the mass media statements on 
the 
agreement on the Karabakh troops withdrawal within the period of 
20 days, as groundless ones. Mass media reported on the fact 
that the agreement was as if achieved as a result of the recent 
meeting of Babken Ararktsyan, a Chairman of the Armenian 
Parliament, and Rasul Guliyev, a Chairman of the Azerbaijani 
Milli Majlis. 
  According to the information the Karabakh side possesses, 
Mr. 
Chairman said, there were discussed ways of the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. No concrete treaty was 
concluded.

  [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the 
latest situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the 
border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Before we do so, 
however, we wish to comment on the meeting the chairmen of the 
Supreme Soviets of Armenia and Azerbaijan held on the border 
between Idzhevanskiy and Kazakhskiy Rayons on 12 March. 
  The meeting was anxiously awaited. Undoubtedly, it was very 
important. It is premature yet to discuss the outcome of the 
talks. However, several mass media organs have issued 
conflicting reports. 
  The situation along NKR's front lines is tense. The 
situation at the front lines has not changed during the past two 
days. Azerbaijan's National Army [ANA] units have fired 
intensely on the Armenian positions in several areas with 
various types of arms. They have also launched wide-scale 
attacks in an attempt to penetrate the Armenian defenses. As 
usual, the ANA units failed to achieve their objective. They 
were counterattacked by the Armenian Armed Forces and forced to 
withdraw to their previous positions after losing men and 
military equipment. 
  Positional fighting took place at the NKR front line 
yesterday. 
  The situation deteriorated on the border between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan during the past week. This is because several 
Armenian border areas were fired on from Azerbaijan. The 
Armenian side has not retaliated in order to avoid worsening the 
situation. 
  The Armenian Ministry of Defense press service has disclosed 
that tension has escalated on Noyemberyanskiy Rayon's border. 
The ANA units fired on the defense positions around Koti with 
infantry combat vehicles and machine guns yesterday. However, 
no one was hurt. The Armenian border guards refrained from 
launching retaliatory operations. The Armenian Ministry of 
Defense has warned that Azerbaijan will be held fully 
responsible if tension further escalates as a result of the 
provocative activities. The ministry said that the situation at 
other parts of the border was relatively peaceful yesterday and 
last night. 
  We hope that the talks between the chairmen of the 
parliaments of the two republics will contribute toward the 
establishment of peace on the entire border.

  [Text] Moscow, March 15 (SNARK)--As a manifestation of 
"political idiotism" characterized Zurab Achba--the Chairman of 
Legislation Committee in Abkhazian Parliament, staying now in 
Moscow--the resolution of Georgian Supreme Council on 
dissolution of Abkhazian Parliament. 
  In his opinion, this is an attempt to torpedo the peace 
process. "Instead of starting a peace dialogue we are being 
abolished", told Achba.

  [Excerpt] The news program of Moscow's Ostankino Television 
aired yet another provocative report on 13 March that was 
probably submitted by the Azerbaijani side. This is always the 
case whenever the conflicting sides come close to an agreement 
on a cease-fire and the commencement of talks. 
  Before reporting on the meeting between Babken Ararktsyan, 
chairman of Armenian Supreme Council, and Rasul Guliyev, 
chairman of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet, at the 
Idzhevanskiy-Kazakhskiy border on 12 March, the announcer stated 
that the Armenian side was forced to halt military operations 
because of losses it recently suffered in Karabakh. 
  This is an absolute lie because the Nagorno-Karabakh 
Republic 
and Armenia have always proposed a cease-fire and talks. The 
claim about Armenian defeats is also a lie. The only success by 
the Azerbaijani side since the start of the offensive on 18 
December 1993 was that they penetrated Kelbadzharskiy Rayon. 
However, they suffered considerable losses and were forced out. 
The Azerbaijanis have always suffered defeats and have lost 
tens of thousands of men on the other war fronts too. 
  During his interview, Rasul Guliyev said that the Armenian 
forces must be withdrawn from all Azerbaijani lands. 
  This has always been Azerbaijan's aspiration. However, the 
opposing side has never agreed to it, and no such agreement was 
concluded during the aforementioned meeting. This was confirmed 
by Babken Ararktsyan in his statement to Mayak Radio following 
the report on Ostankino. In refuting that report and in an 
attempt to avoid similar intrigues by the Azerbaijani side, the 
chairman of the Armenian Supreme Council declared that 
henceforth Armenia will not go to such meetings unless the 
Karabakh side also takes part in them. 
  Babken Ararktsyan spoke in detail about this meeting in his 
news conference today. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "First Results"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Elections to representative state power bodies 
within the Council of the Federation were held in five regions 
of Russia on Sunday. They were declared valid in the majority 
of districts. According to preliminary figures, sufficient 
numbers of voters went to the polls in 35 of the 47 districts in 
the Chuvash Republic. 
  The elections were declared valid in 34 out of 50 districts 
in Altay. 
  In Khabarovsk Kray, the corresponding figure is 23 out of 25 
districts. 
  In Kostroma Oblast, elections were validated in 14 out of 15 
oblasts. 
  In the Jewish Autonomous Oblast the figure is 11 out of 15 
districts. 
  The Central Electoral Commission announced that more precise 
figures will be known tomorrow. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Altay Kray </H5>
  The experience of having government members become deputies 
and switch to work in the State Duma without leaving their 
government posts is evidently going to be repeated in Altay. By 
far, the greatest number of candidates for the Kray legislative 
assembly registered here were administration heads or directors. 
According to legal experts, if the elections end in their favor 
the principle of the division of powers expounded in the 
Constitution will thereby be violated. After all, the job of 
the majority of contenders for the kray legislative assembly is 
to resolve economic problems, while the functions of the 
representative power consist of adopting laws and monitoring 
administration activity, whereas administration heads and 
leaders of all ranks involved in the executive structures are 
going to start adopting laws, so to speak, "to suit themselves." 
It is not difficult to guess where this could lead. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Ilgiz Khairullin, vice premier of Tataria 
[Tatarstan], a republic incorporated in Russia, said in Kazan 
Tuesday that 58.5 percent of the eligible voters went to the 
booths to vote in March 13 elections to the Russian Federal 
Assembly. He added that the elections were held in all towns 
and districts of the republic. 
  Tataria's President Mintimer Shaimiyev won 91.2 percent of 
the valid votes and the republic's parliament speaker Farid 
Mukhametshin, 74.1 percent. Shaimiyev won more votes than when 
he had been elected president. The two men were elected to the 
Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian parliament. 
  Gennady Yegorov, chairman of the Almetyevsk town council, 
Vladimir Altukhov, director of a small business, Gabdulvakhit 
Bagautdinov, director of an orphanage, Oleg Morozov, a columnist 
now residing in Moscow, and Valentin Mikhailov, an activist of 
the People's Power movement, were elected to the State Duma, the 
lower house of the Russian parliament. 
  Khairullin said that the advocates of full independence had 
failed in their attempts to hamper elections and the voting had 
passed smoothly throughout the republic.

  [Text] Tension is mounting in the North Caucasus, Musa 
Shanibov, president of the Confederation of Caucasian Peoples 
(CCP) told INTERFAX. In his view, local conflicts could grow 
into an all-out war throughout that region. 
  Shanibov feared that a Kabardino-Balkarian problem might 
emerge on top of the Abkhazian, Ossetian-Ingush, Chechen and 
Ossetian-Georgian troubles. He accused Sergey Filatov, the 
Russian president's chief of staff, of having inspired the 
decree on steps to rehabilitate the Balkarian people issued by 
Valeriy Kokov, the president of the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic 
(KBR). The decree called for reinstatement of two Balkarian 
districts that had been abolished in 1944. Shanibov felt that 
the decree might revive KBR's territorial claims on parts of 
Northern Ossetia and the Stavropol Territory. 
  On the other hand, Shanibov believed that those who did not 
want war and supported Abkhazia and the CCP to an extent were 
gaining influence in the Russian leadership. 
  He said that the CCP intended to establish contacts with the 
West and international organizations with a view to obtaining 
their aid in resolving the North Caucasian problems.

<F P=106> [Unattributed roundup of election results: "Elections to </F>
the Federal Assembly and Local Organs of Power Have Been Held in 
Russian Regions] 
  [Excerpts] Kazan -- More than half of the adult population 
voted in the repeat elections to the Federal Assembly. The 
elections went ahead despite various rumors and propaganda by 
extreme nationalists against participation in the vote. 
According to preliminary information, the voters of 
Almetyevskiy and Nizhnekamskiy electoral okrugs demonstrated the 
greatest turnout -- over 59 percent of those entered on the 
lists. 
  Speaking on republic television last Friday, Mintimer 
Shaymiyev stated that the situation has changed sharply since 
the day of the previous elections to the Russian parliament, in 
which only 13.8 percent of the republic's adult population 
participated. "Russia and Tatarstan have concluded an 
interstate treaty which has been approved by the people," he 
stressed. "And the republic must have its representatives in 
the Russian parliament." [passage omitted] 
  Barnaul -- The elections to the Kray Legislative Assembly 
and 
the organs of local self-government in Altay went ahead. 
According to the preliminary results, 36.8 percent of voters 
entered on the lists took part in the vote. 
  Novgorod -- The election campaign for elections to the 
Novgorod Oblast Duma, which will be held 27 March, has entered 
its decisive phase. A total of 143 candidates contending for 27 
seats are making haste to announce themselves on television 
screens, on local radio, and in the newspapers. 
  Novosibirsk -- Only around 40 percent of voters intend to 
take part in the elections scheduled for 27 March to the 
Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet of Deputies, as polls have shown. The 
advancement of candidates, which has now ended, was also 
characterized by a drop in the former activeness. Only two 
candidates were registered in almost one-third of okrugs, mainly 
in rural areas. The activeness was greater is city okrugs.

<F P=106> [Report by Dmitriy Kamyshev, Aleksandr Goncharov: "Kalmykia </F>
Wants To Be a Guberniya. The President Is Tired of Being a 
President"] 
  [Excerpts] Kalmykia President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who has 
repeatedly scandalized the Russian public with his 
unconventional steps, has once again come to the attention of 
politicians and the press. Addressing Kalmykian 
parliamentarians, he proposed that they abrogate the republican 
constitution and lower Kalmykia's status to that of a kray or an 
oblast. Against the backdrop of habitual demands by Federation 
components about greater autonomy, the Kalmykian president's 
proposal for the voluntary return "under Moscow's heel" sounds 
sensational. If it is adopted by the deputies, the Great Steppe 
Code, the draft of which the president submitted yesterday to 
the parliament for consideration, may become Kalmykia's 
fundamental law. [passage omitted] 
  The Kalmykian president's new political move is apparently 
the strongest one in his entire political career -- both 
according to the effect it produced and its possible 
consequences. At a time when Chechnya is stubbornly chanting 
independence mantras, Tatarstan is relishing its special status, 
and a number of other Federation components are dreaming of 
repeating Kazan's success, many advocates of a "soft" federation 
appear to see Ilyumzhinov's initiative as a subversive action by 
"Moscow agents." This is how it seems to have been received by 
the Federation Council; Mr. Ilyumzhinov says that he has already 
had telephone calls from the Council wondering if this step had 
been agreed on with Yeltsin. Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, however, in a 
conversation with your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent flatly 
denied the suggestion about the alleged preliminary agreement 
with the federal authorities. In his view, the republican 
status impedes, not facilitates, close cooperation with the 
center. Federal ministries are reluctant to embark on joint 
projects with republics for fear of unpredictable steps, "even a 
cessation." 
  Observers do not doubt that the parliament will approve the 
president's proposal. In this event, the future of Kirsan 
Ilyumzhinov himself so far remains uncertain, but it is evident 
that upon losing the status of president he may acquire 
something more valuable: the laurels of a pioneer paving the 
way for Russia's return to a guberniya-based structure, 
something for which certain politicians in Moscow have been 
calling for a long time.

Commentaries" rubric: "Vladimir Shumeyko's `Military Day' in 
Kaliningrad. Patronage Is a Good Thing, But It Is More Useful 
To `Be Friends' With the Army Every Day"] 
  [Text] The "military program" of the two-day working tour 
of Kaliningrad Oblast by Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the 
Federation Council of the Russian Federal Assembly, was packed: 
On the morning of 10 March he put to sea for four hours on 
board the destroyer Nastoychivyy, and after dinner tactical 
exercises at the marines' training center lasted until late in 
the evening. At a rally marking the Nastoychivyy's return to 
Baltiysk, Vladimir Shumeyko voiced satisfaction with the 
seamen's training and announced that the Federation Council is 
assuming patronage of the destroyer. 
  According to the seamen, before Shumeyko, none of the 
politicians of his rank who had visited Kaliningrad Oblast had 
devoted so much time to the social problems of servicemen. 
These problems are quite acute: The oblast accounts for 11 
percent of the total number of Russian Army servicemen without 
apartments, and approximately 8,000 Baltic Fleet officers and 
warrant officers are without housing. The local administration 
is repaying its housing debts to servicemen only slowly and 
unwillingly: Last year the Kaliningrad authorities "gave up" 
only...one apartment. At the same time the oblast's 
construction capacities are not great, and all hope is pinned on 
the Lithuanian firm of "Selma." Vladas Laurinavicius, its 
leader, is well known in Kaliningrad. Under a contract he has 
pledged to erect the "Severnyy-2" residential district over the 
next two years. This means precisely 4,300 apartments. To all 
appearances, the Lithuanians will complete construction ahead of 
schedule but will not, alas, remove the acuteness of the problem. 
  Of course, patronage of a destroyer, cruiser, or regiment is 
a good thing, but the way out undoubtedly consists in a 
clear-cut, comprehensively considered social program for 
servicemen in Kaliningrad Oblast. The need for this can also be 
felt, however, in other parts of Russia.

  [Text] Russia's Chief Navy Commander Admiral Felix Gromov 
on Tuesday arrived in northern Russia to examine the combat 
readiness and seaworthiness of the Northern Fleet's warships as 
well as the state of discipline and accident prevention. 
  On the same day, Gromov put to sea on board anti-submarine 
ship Admiral Kharlamov to test the crew's combat skills, a navy 
spokesman told Interfax. 
  In the meantime, his deputy Admiral Igor Kasatonov in an 
interview with Interfax described the fleet as being Russia's 
most powerful naval group both operationally and strategically. 
In his words, it is the Northern Fleet which has most of the 
country's nuclear-powered submarines carrying nuclear missiles. 
The admiral said the Fleet was securing Russia's strategic 
interests in that direction. 
  On the might of the four Russian fleets, Kasatonov said that 
by far the strongest of them all were the Northern and Pacific 
Fleets, both of them ocean-going. By contrast, the Baltic and 
Black Sea Fleets are responsible for carrying out regional 
tasks, he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Chugayev: "First Attempt To Keep People </F>
Out of Presidential Elections Made in Duma"] 
  [Text] Addressing a plenary sitting of the State Duma on 
11 March V. Isakov, chairman of the principal Duma committee, on 
legislation and judicial and legal reform, unexpectedly proposed 
a new way of electing the Russian president. Not by a 
nationwide vote, but by a kind of new Assembly of the Land, 
comprising the members of the Federation Council and 
representatives of the territories. V. Isakov's reasoning was 
that nationwide presidential elections would lead to the 
destabilization of the political situation in Russia and could 
split it into several warring camps. So, in his view, depriving 
voters of the only check on the supreme authority they have left 
following the adoption of the new Constitution -- the right to 
elect the country's president once every four years -- is a 
stabilizing factor. 
  It is worth noting that V. Isakov's proposal sounded as 
though it was supposed to develop the detailed report by Duma 
chairman I. Rybkin, the main theme of which was approximately as 
follows: The Duma is switching from political battles to 
productive lawmaking. The main grounds for this switch, it was 
indicated, is the prospect of achieving civil peace and accord 
in the country. In fact, support for the ideas put forward by 
the president in his message to parliament on the part of very 
diverse political forces represented in the Duma was all but the 
leitmotiv of the 11 March debate. In particular, 
representatives of the communists and the LDPR [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia] voiced considerable approval, noting 
that B. Yeltsin's program coincided with their own party 
programs. Perhaps only "Russia's Choice" was critical of the 
ideas announced by the executive authority, thus ending up in a 
minority. But does this mean one can say that the evolution of 
the president's views, as recorded in his message to parliament 
and confirmed by the draft budget message, paves the way for the 
longed-for civil peace? 
  I. Rybkin immediately and publicly disavowed V. Isakov's 
statement, saying that he did it "off his own bat." But, 
knowing V. Isakov, as I do, from his activities in the old 
Russian Federation Supreme Soviet, it is hard to imagine that 
one of the most experienced parliamentary politicians would have 
gotten carried away suddenly and would have put forward for no 
particular reason ideas that grossly contradict the basic 
provisions of the Constitution. 
  The timing was very specific. The results of the vote on the 
question of the 23 February political amnesty convincingly 
demonstrated that the section of the Duma in opposition to the 
president had managed to form an overwhelming majority by 
winning over a number of centrist factions. According to the 
calculations of analytical group experts A. Sobyanin, E. Gelman, 
and O. Kayunov, this majority needs 20-25 votes to obtain a 
two-thirds advantage and the corresponding opportunity to adopt 
the constitutional decisions it needs. According to these 
experts, the political temperature in the State Duma today is 
similar to what it was at the seventh Congress of Russian 
Federation People's Deputies. So there are grounds for saying 
that the opposition has succeeded in capturing the first planned 
position in its fight against the president and it is massing 
for an assault on the second position. This position was very 
clearly indicated by V. Isakov -- the president as the "main 
source of destabilization." 
  Addressing his colleagues on Friday, the Duma speaker 
shared with them his idea of turning every Duma committee into a 
"miniparliament," in which all work on the preparation and 
discussion of draft laws is to be concentrated. All the voting 
on draft laws and other acts that have been prepared and agreed 
in advance is to be carried out at these sittings, without any 
debate. 
  The idea is not new and has been used with some success in 
world parliamentary practice. In Japan, for instance, or the 
United States, whence the Duma speaker returned on the eve of 
the sitting. Certainly, the new scheme for organizing lawmaking 
work, proposed by I. Rybkin, will make it possible to avoid the 
various excesses taking place at plenary sittings, which 
immediately become known to the general electorate and are not 
nice for the Duma. Indeed, it would save considerable time. 
  But, at the same time, all these obvious merits are relevant 
only to an established political system in which the rules of 
the game are clearly defined and are strictly observed by 
everyone. The gist of the rules is that the opinion of all 
political factions and groups in parliament will definitely be 
considered when draft laws are being devised. But in the case 
of the Russian Duma there is strong reason to believe that 
extensive discussion is probably being replaced by the diktat of 
committees in which, as a rule, one faction or another occupies 
key positions. At any rate, that was precisely the case in the 
old Russian Supreme Soviet, and the same trends are apparent in 
the Duma. 
  Among the key legislative acts in the Duma's drafting 
program 
three very important draft laws are to be devised (and 
effectively adopted, if I. Rybkin's proposed drafting model is 
introduced) by the Committee on Legislation and Judicial and 
Legal Reform headed by V. Isakov. They are draft laws on the 
Constitutional Court, on the elections to the State Duma, and on 
Russian presidential elections. In view of the very real 
possibility of the Duma democratic minority's being denied 
participation in the preparation of these draft laws and the 
opposition's possession of a virtual constitutional majority, 
the likelihood of the adoption of a Law on the Constitutional 
Court enabling the opposition to subject the president to an 
impeachment procedure or of a Law on Presidential Elections 
along the lines of that proposed by V. Isakov, should be 
regarded as very real. 
  It is hard to say right now to what extent nationwide 
presidential elections might destabilize the situation among 
ordinary Russian voters. But they are certainly destabilizing 
the situation among the central and regional bureaucracy. The 
Duma politicians on whom the nomenklatura is banking are 
themselves very well aware that none of them has any chance of 
winning the presidential race. So it is highly likely that a 
"dark horse" will breast the tape and cause really serious 
trouble for the political and nomenklatura elite both in the 
capital and in the provinces. It was for that very reason, 
presumably, that the proposal to keep the consideration of new 
presidential candidates and, accordingly, the membership of the 
new government "in the family" was made. To conduct the 
bargaining without witnesses and share out top state posts in 
accordance with the principle: You support our candidate for 
this post and we will support your candidate for that post. This 
is the only way the political forces behind V. Isakov will have 
a chance to get back into power in Russia. It is typical that 
in the corridors of the Duma V. Isakov expressed every 
confidence that his idea would meet with approval in the 
Federation Council. 
  So V. Isakov's statement looks more than anything like a 
trial balloon, launched in order to discover how far it is 
possible to go at the moment in the proposed direction, along 
the path leading, whether V. Isakov likes it or not, to the 
establishment of nomenklatura diktat in the country and creation 
of a state system over which citizens would have no control (in 
this respect I. Rybkin's proposal on dispensing with debates at 
Duma plenary sittings looks very logical). 
  As for the president's latest actions, for which he even won 
praise in some communist newspapers, it appears they merely 
facilitate the opposition's progress along this path, since they 
cause schism and confusion in the ranks of the democrats. But 
V. Isakov honestly and candidly gave to undertsand that if B. 
Yeltsin were to declare himself tomorrow to be the sternest 
statist and loyalest Leninist he would still be the opposition's 
"number one target."

<F P=106> [Interview with Reserve Major General Petr Shirshov, </F>
chairman of the Russian Federal Assembly Committee for Security 
and Defense Questions, by Aleksandr Pelts; date and place not 
given: "Petr Shirshov: Legislative Process Not Currently 
Keeping Pace With Life"] 
  [Text] Petr Petrovich Shirshov is a reserve major general. 
He was born in Orenburg in 1945. He graduated from Orenburg 
Higher Missile Defense Command School. He has had 12 postings 
during his service. The last one was in the city of Bryansk. 
In February 1994 he was elected chairman of the Committee for 
Security and Defense Questions of the Russian Federal Assembly's 
upper house. 
  [Pelts] Petr Petrovich, until recently you were a regular 
officer. Tell me, how do people become politicians? For what 
reasons did your general's uniform suddenly become "too tight"? 
  [Shirshov] My current position is in a certain sense a 
surprise to me personally, but at the same time it was thought 
out and, I would say, deliberate. 
  A deputy's work is something I am familiar with. When I was 
still serving I was a deputy at various levels. You probably 
know that at that time certain deputies' duties came, so to 
speak, "with the job." I mainly worked in committees and 
commissions on socialist legality, social protection for 
servicemen, and servicemen's problems. 
  These were the facts which obviously determined my future. 
In March 1990 (by that time I had already been twice elected a 
Bryansk City Soviet deputy) I was offered the chairmanship. I 
will say frankly that I had many doubts. I liked service life, 
things were not going badly.... In short, it is always 
difficult to change one's life. Especially as my chances of 
becoming a general would go out of the window if I took up this 
offer. 
  But at the last city session, at which the question of the 
city soviet chairman was being decided, all the candidates voted 
in my favor. So I headed Bryansk City Soviet and I carried out 
these duties right up until the soviets' disbandment. I wore 
only military uniform for a whole three years. Initially this 
surprised many people. Then my general's tunic stopped 
"hurting" people's eyes. Incidentally, I took it off on 4 
October last year. 
  [Pelts] As a result of your election to the Federal 
Assembly's upper house your potential has increased 
considerably. As chairman of a key committee, what would you 
like to do first of all? 
  [Shirshin] Above all I want to stress that we are already 
engaged in practical work. The subcommittee on security is 
currently working on six draft laws which will be submitted to 
the house for discussion in the near future. In addition, 
organizational work is being completed -- the committee is 
defining the scope of its activity, "settling in" in terms of 
personnel, and establishing the necessary contacts with other 
committees of both the upper and lower houses of the Federal 
Assembly. 
  What am I personally working on? Drafting a constitutional 
amendment on the use of the Armed Forces inside the country. I 
believe that it should be clearly written into our constitution 
that the use of the Army in combat inside the state to resolve 
political questions is prohibited. It is still too early to 
talk about the final version of the text of this amendment, but 
the point, I think, is clear. The Army should be used to 
protect the state's interests and security only when there is a 
threat from outside. All internal problems must be solved by 
other power structures. 
  I am sure that I am not original in this conviction and, 
importantly, I am not alone. Most reasonable and judicious 
politicians have a similar viewpoint. Furthermore, servicemen 
themselves are openly stating this. I believe that the adoption 
of this amendment will be one of the first steps of our 
Committee To Implement the Right to Legislative Initiative. 
  [Pelts] You said that the committee's structural 
organization is being completed. But I have noticed that 
compared with other committees yours is virtually the 
smallest.... 
  [Shirshov] You are right. As of today our committee has 
only 16 deputies. Is that a lot or not many? Here I would 
recall Aleksandr Suvorov's saying about winning not by weight of 
numbers but by skill. From this viewpoint I believe that the 
committee's composition is totally satisfactory. We have people 
capable of, so to speak, literally getting to grips with all the 
most important areas of work. For example, for the problems of 
the military-industrial complex (and this is a whole range of 
questions) we have Petr Vasilyevich Romanov. For questions on 
the Armed Forces we have Ruslan Sultanovich Aushev plus your 
obedient servant. What else? For intelligence, security, and 
counterintelligence we have my deputy, Petr Grigoryevich Premyak 
(a captain first rank, incidentally). In short, all the 
committee members are experienced, knowledgeable people who are 
professionals in their own field. 
  [Pelts] Petr Petrovich, currently much is being said about 
the need for a review of the package of "military laws" adopted 
by what was then the Russian Supreme Soviet. What is your 
attitude to this idea? 
  [Shirshov] The situation is changing, and views are changing 
too. There is nothing terrible about that. If some laws need a 
little more work, I am all for that. It is another matter if we 
are talking about reducing the rights reflected in the "military 
package" of laws. The legislative process is objectively not 
keeping pace with our current difficult life. I am convinced 
that people must not be put in an even more difficult position. 
  [Pelts] But the explanations of those who think otherwise 
are also logical. They say that there is simply no money to 
implement adopted laws.... 
  [Shirshov] I agree, such a problem does exist. But here too 
we can and must find a solution. For example, the military 
budget again. I believe that it must be formulated with 
specific tasks in mind. This is the strategic approach. We all 
know that most important, priority areas exist in 
military-organizational development. That means financing for 
these areas must also be given priority. By financing 
everything en masse we will inevitably "lose" investments in the 
most complex bureaucratic labyrinths. 
  [Pelts] Incidentally, many of our readers are reporting this 
problem. For example, funds for pay are apparently being 
allocated but the payee gets them only after a delay of several 
months. Do you intend to look into this? 
  [Shirshov] Undoubtedly. And in the very near future. I am 
convinced that in this situation the reasons for this phenomenon 
must be found without fail. It is due, I think, to an official 
who either did not make a timely decision or made it to the 
detriment of the same servicemen. I want to give my assurance 
that we will check up without fail on where the money is 
"going," why it is being held back, and who is possibly making a 
fortune from it. 
  [Pelts] How do you intend to collaborate with the State 
Duma's "defense" committee? 
  [Shirshin] Why "intend"? We are already collaborating. I 
recently met with Aleksandr Piskunov. We talked about many 
problems concerning our collaboration. In addition, in the 
future we are planning to consider many draft documents jointly. 
I am convinced that close contacts are useful both for working 
out a common viewpoint and for raising the quality and 
efficiency of our work. 
  Incidentally, I will add that we are interested in contacts 
with a group of Russian Defense Ministry experts and other power 
structures. Ideally I see a group of experts under our 
committee from all Armed Forces branches. But even this will 
not apparently be enough. Because our terms of reference 
include questions which simply cannot be tackled without careful 
and comprehensive expert study. 
  [Pelts] For example, such questions as the ratification of 
the recently signed treaty with Georgia.... 
  [Shirshin] I do not propose to rush into final 
assessments. But in my view the interests of a whole group of 
territories were not studied fully during that visit. And, as 
we know, you cannot clap hands with only one hand. It is a very 
subtle and delicate problem. I will stress again that I am now 
expressing my personal viewpoint -- before signing this "Big 
Treaty," as it is being called, Georgia should have resolved its 
own internal problems itself. Moreover, without our 
participation. But we will wait for the official reaction of 
both the upper and lower houses of the Federal Assembly. I 
think that these will come soon. 
  [Pelts] The last question is of a personal nature. What do 
you do with your spare time? What is your hobby? 
  [Shirshin] It is trite to repeat that I have virtually no 
spare time. But if I do get some, I enjoy fishing and hunting. 
I really love working on the land -- I have my own 
six-hundredths of a hectare. True, I have no time to get out 
there. But generally I love nature. And I love work done by my 
own hands.

  [Text] Speaker of the State Duma (the lower house of 
parliament) Ivan Rybkin has reaffirmed a statement from his 
counterpart of the upper house Vladimir Shumeyko saying the two 
of them had discussed the possibility of adopting a law on a 
state of emergency in the country's economy on Tuesday. 
  In an interview with Interfax, he said Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin was also involved in discussion about delays in 
adopting this year's budget. Rybkin said although the budget 
bill should have been discussed by the Duma in January, the 
government would table it only next week. "This means the Duma 
will be unable to approve a budget for the second quarter of 
this year", he said. 
  Rybkin said that three possible options of adopting the 
budget were discussed. One is a special law. Next, the 
suspension of some articles of the law on emergency measures. 
And finally, to go on as usual, in which case, he said "we will 
need at least two or three months to approve the budget which 
means a repeat of the situation of 1992-1993 when Russia had to 
survive without a budget". 
  However, Rybkin declined to say which of the three options 
was best. "Sometimes it seems that a short cut is the best 
solution. I do not know if that is true. The issue will come 
under discussion by the Duma Council today", he said.

  [Text] Russian Minister for Nationalities and Regional 
Policies, Sergey Shakhray, stood against the lifting of the 
state of emergency in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict 
until the conflicting parties started negotiating. He said the 
lifting of the state of emergency could trigger off a new armed 
conflict and make necessary the introduction of the armed forces 
in the region. Shakhray spoke during the closed parliamentary 
hearings in the Federation Council which discussed settlement of 
the inter-ethnic conflict. According to Shakhray, the state of 
emergency must be preserved, and does not demand significant 
expenses. 
  Shakhray told Interfax that the cost of financing the 
interim 
administration in the conflict zone during 1993 had been put at 
23 Bn rubles. He stressed that the Ingush budget was subsidized 
by 97and the North Ossetian one by 60Both republics 
explained the financing by the necessity to eliminate of the 
conflict's consequences. However, "not a single house has as 
yet been repaired," Shakhray said. 
  According to him, due to the current situation it was 
necessary to resort to economic pressure through use of the 
federal budget. This means that financial aid must be 
conditioned with the holding of negotiations between the 
conflicting parties. The central authorities must help with the 
negotiations and establish the needed guarantees, he emphasized. 
  Shakhray said that during the parliament's meeting he had 
received the impression that the North Ossetian and the Ingush 
presidents were ready to negotiate.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 15 TASS -- "Local self-government was 
described as "the basis of political stability of the state and 
social welfare of the population" by the leader of the PRES 
[Party of Unity and Accord] Duma faction Sergey Shakhray, who is 
also the federal minister of nationalities and regional policy. 
  Shakhray said in his speech in the State Duma's hearings 
about local government reform that 80 per cent of people's vital 
interests are realized at local level. 
  Shakhray said reform of local self-government would help 
bring closer together the taxpayer and the territorial bodies of 
power and thus reduce the influence of the central power on the 
inhabitants of regions, which, in turn, "will ease the tension 
of the struggle for power in the state as a whole". 
  In the course of reforms, three levels of state government 
will emerge: the federal level, the level of the component parts 
of the federation, and the level of local government, Shakhray 
said. 
  With this in view, the country needs a system of agreements 
among the component parts of the federation and bodies of local 
government on the division of powers and authority. 
  Shakhray stressed that the local governments must be granted 
the right to independently handle the necessary financial 
resources, which makes it expedient to reform the budget and tax 
system, because "the situation is absolutely abnormal where 
two-thirds of Russia's component parts survive on subsidies from 
the centre", Shakhray said. 
  According to him, the reform of the budget and tax system 
must result in a rational distribution of the taxation base 
"within a normally functioning state," in which 20 per cent of 
all taxes will go to meet the federal needs, thirty per cent to 
meet the needs of the component parts of the Russian Federation 
and not less than fifty per cent of all tax revenue must remain 
at the local level. 
  Shakhray said the bodies of local self-government should 
have 
the inalienable right to dispose of municipal property and 
municipal land at their discretion as the guarantee of their 
economic independence.

  [Text] Moscow March 15 TASS -- The Russian Parliament's 
Upper House, the Federation Council, approved at today's session 
a plan for legislative initiatives for the first six months of 
1994. The plan provides for 19 bills to be drafted and 
submitted for the consideration of the state duma, the 
parliament's lower house. 
  The bills on the list include several draft laws worked out 
on the basis of provisions of the presidential message to the 
Federal Assembly. These are a draft law "On Russia's Free 
Economic Zones", "On Participation of Russian Military 
Contingents in Peacekeeping Missions, Including Within the CIS, 
CSCE and UN Framework", "On International Treaties of the 
Russian Federation", On the Status of Foreigners in Russia, and 
"On Higher and Post-Graduate Professional Education". 
  The Federation Council also suggests drafting laws "on 
Federal Bodies of State Power", "On a Procedure for 
Implementation of the Federative Treaty and Delimitation of 
Powers", "Basic Principles of Legislation on Veterans", "On 
Federated Arrangement of the Russian Federation", and "On the 
Status of a Subject of the Russian Federation". 
  Addressing the gathering with a report, the House's First 
Deputy Speaker Ramazan Abdulatipov proposed setting up a 
scientific coordinating body to coordinate legislative 
activities by both chambers of the Russian Parliament. 
  The Federation Council passed a resolution saying it would 
resume discussing the plan of legislative initiatives after the 
state duma approved an analogous document.

<F P=106> [Ivan Rodin report under the "Authority" rubric: "Duma </F>
Assesses President's Message. It Promises To Pass Without Delay 
Laws of Top State Importance"] 
  [Text] The State Duma will adopt a decree today on where 
it stands on the president's message "On Strengthening the 
Russian State." The draft of the Duma decree was prepared by a 
working group under Valentin Kovalev (Russian Federation 
Communist Party), the chamber's deputy chairman. The document 
has been signed by representatives of all factions except 
Yabloko, as well as separately by Mr. Zhirinovskiy and Mr. 
Gaydar. The draft of this decree is a marriage -- one upon 
which various Duma factions insisted -- of a declaratory 
reaction and of a rather negative reaction. 
  The decree points out that the most important task facing 
the 
State Duma, which shares the main points of the president's 
message, is legislative support for "the Russian Federation's 
evolution toward the creation of an integral and stable 
democratic state where human and civil rights are honored, where 
an efficient economy functions, where the principles of 
federative relations are consistently realized, and the rights 
of big and small nations are upheld." The draft decree suggests 
that the government evolve a plan of measures to overcome the 
socioeconomic crisis. As for Duma activity in the realm of 
draft laws, it is supposed to give priority to draft laws 
dealing with stabilization of the economy, finances, and 
protection for the country's commodity producers. 
  The State Duma thinks it necessary to set up conciliation 
working groups of representatives of the president's staff, the 
government, and the Federal Assembly in order to "minimize the 
time consumed in the procedure of agreeing on the top state 
priority draft laws, and promises to consider them without 
delay. The last point of the draft decree proposes that the 
president and the government should settle the nonpayment crisis 
and eliminate delays in the payment of wages.

  [Excerpt] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stated 
his intention of conducting his present talks in Vladivostok 
with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher "from the 
position of a mature strategic partnership." 
  During the meeting that started in the Vladivostok Airport 
building straight after the official welcome ceremony for Warren 
Christopher, the heads of the Russian and U.S. foreign policy 
departments plan to discuss a brpad range of political, 
economic, and other issues. 
  In turn U.S Secretary of State Warren Christopher said at a 
press conference in Beijing before leaving for Vladivostok that 
consultations and coordination between Russia and the United 
States are extremely desirable. 
  With regard to the statements that "Russia is unhappy about 
being regarded as a junior partner," Christopher stressed that 
"Kozyrev has never said that to me. We are partners in our 
desire for reforms and support for reformers in Russia. And we 
will discuss these issues." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Pavel Shinkarenko under "Diplomacy" rubric: </F>
"Andrey Kozyrev and Warren Christopher Are `Filling the Cracks' 
Which Have Appeared in the Edifice of Russian-U.S. Relations"] 
  [Text] Only two months have passed since the meeting 
between Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton, which was successful in 
every respect, but quite a few "cracks" have appeared in the 
edifice of the Russian-U.S. partnership announced in Moscow. 
There has been the Ames espionage "affair," the embarrassment 
over the Moscow visit of ex-President Nixon, Washington's 
emissary, and the different readings of ways to settle the 
Bosnian crisis. Let us add to this the tragedy in the Arab 
mosque in Hebron, which interrupted the process which had begun 
of settling the Arab-Israeli conflict; the problems of the 
Russian-speaking population in the Baltic countries.... 
  As we see, there are quite a few topics to analyze. 
Therefore the latest meeting between the heads of the Russian 
and U.S. foreign policy departments, which took place in 
Vladivostok yesterday, resembled the work of restorers filling 
cracks in the walls of an ancient building. International 
problems were also discussed in passing. Particularly as Andrey 
Kozyrev has just visited the Near East, where he held talks with 
the leaders of Israel and the PLO, while Warren Christopher has 
visited a number of countries in the Asia and Pacific region. 
  At Vnukovo Airport, from where the head of the Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs flew to Vladivostok, Andrey Kozyrev 
remarked in conversation with journalists that there are certain 
circles both in the United States and in Russia which dislike 
cooperation between the two countries, particularly when it 
takes on a strategic nature. Nevertheless, the minister 
believes that Russian-U.S. relations will continue to be based 
on the principles of the Moscow Declaration. "It is a 
strategic, mature partnership, indications of which are a 
commonality of interests and a close level of contacts," he 
emphasized.

enemies have become our partners, their activities off the 
Russian coasts has not reduced." 
  He told INTERFAX that "contacts and even collisions" with 
U.S. submarines off the Russian coasts had been registered last 
year. The submarines were most active off the Kola Peninsula and 
the Russian Far Eastern Maritime Territory. 
  Kasatonov said that "the U.S. subs have not left those 
areas. 
On the contrary, they show vigor and enviable tenacity." 
  According to Russian Navy experts, "foreign countries have 
retained the formations of their surface ships and submarines," 
Kasatonov emphasized. 
  "This compels the Russian military to act so as to protect 
Russia's safety," Kasatonov said. 
  He denied that Russian submarines were prowling off Florida.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Pavel Vanichkin and Arkadiy </F>
Sidoruk] 
  [Text] Washington, 15 Mar -- The development of cooperation 
with the United States of America in the energy sphere is the 
main preoccupation of Viktor Mikhaylov, Russia's minister of 
atomic energy, who is paying a working visit to the United 
States. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS, V. Mikhaylov disclosed that 
one of the main objectives of the visit and the business 
meetings which began at the Department of Energy on Monday is to 
get the U.S. side to make a decision on ways to help Russia to 
end production of enriched uranium-239. On the American side 
the meetings are being chaired by Secretary of Energy Hazel 
O'Leary. 
  The visit is taking place in the context of the work done by 
the bilateral intergovermental commission chaired by U.S. Vice 
President Albert Gore and Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, the Russian minister said. The members of this 
commission have already agreed that Russia will be given U.S. 
financial assistance to build a store for weapons-grade 
materials, which could subsequently be used as fuel for nuclear 
power stations. Washington has already allocated the first $75 
million for the purchase of equipment for this project, 
Mikhaylov noted. We now intend to ask the Americans to speed up 
the handover of another $75 million for actual construction of 
the store. In return we are prepared to speed up a decision on 
halting production of weapons-grade plutonium -- which, 
incidentally, is our objective anyway. However, it has to be 
remembered that the capacities which produce plutonium also 
generate electricity and heat. Therefore, the replacement of 
these capacities with alternative forms of energy production is 
a pressing matter. We also intend to discuss this question 
during the visit to Washington. Concluding the interview, 
Mikhaylov noted that Russian experts have developed a good 
working relationship with their U.S. colleagues, and this fact 
gives grounds for hoping that the results of the present visit 
will be useful. 
  Our joint aim is to assist with the practical implementation 
of the agreement reached in Moscow last December by Albert Gore 
and Viktor Chernomyrdin on the closure of Russia's three 
remaining plutonium reactors -- two at Krasnoyarsk and one in 
Tomsk -- and their replacement with alternative sources of 
energy production, Birls, special assistant to the U.S. energy 
secretary on Russia and other CIS countries, told ITAR-TASS. 
Birls, who is also attending the working meetings, says he is 
sure that a detailed report, including all the technical 
details, will be prepared in time for the third session of the 
intergovernmental commission, chaired by the U.S. vice president 
and the Russian prime minister. This will be held at the end of 
May.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow, March 15 (TASS) -- PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat 
will visit Moscow on April 19 and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin will make a Moscow visit on April 24-26 at the invitation 
of President Yeltsin and under an agreement reached during the 
recent Tunisian and Israeli visits of Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev, deputy director of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry's department for Middle East and Northern Africa Viktor 
Gogitidze told a briefing here today. 
  Estimating Kozyrev's trip, Gogitidze said that major tasks 
were fulfilled: An essential agreement of both sides was 
reached and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat is ready to resume the 
negotiations. The Russian side is convinced both the Israelis 
and the Palestinians are adherent to the peace process and would 
like further talks. 
  "The Russian side stressed that in case of resumed dialogue 
the main attention should be given to the soonest completion of 
negotiations on the Gaza-Jericho project. Measures to implement 
the project should immediately follow," said the diplomat. In 
his opinion, "this would help to cool passions and guarantee, to 
a certain degree, security on the occupied lands". 
  Russia will take more efforts to achieve the soonest 
completion of negotiations on Gaza-Jericho and help the 
implementation of agreements, said Gogitidze. "Today's priority 
is the adoption of a Security Council resolution on Hebron. If 
the resolution is adopted there will be no obstacles for the 
resumption of Israeli-PLO negotiations," he stressed. 
  The settlers' problem that has grown most acute may be 
discussed "parallelly with the resumption of Israeli-PLO 
negotiations. A form of its solution can be found with the 
assistance of Russian diplomats, the co-sponsors and in direct 
contacts between Israel and the PLO," said Gogitidze.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Belyakov commentary: "The Return of the Russian </F>
Bear"] 
  [Text] Cairo -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
has been on a trip to the Near East. He visited Israel and 
Tunisia, where the headquarters of the PLO are located. As 
Kozyrev stated during the trip, its aim was to save the Near 
East "peace process." It was interrupted after an Israeli 
settler carried out a massacre in a mosque in the Palestinian 
city of Hebron 25 February, killing and wounding dozens of 
people. 
  Russia reacted quickly to this crime and its political 
consequences. First of all First Deputy Foreign Minister Igor 
Ivanov left for Tunisia and Israel. Then President Boris 
Yeltsin appointed Viktor Psuvalyuk, director of the Near East 
Department at the Foreign Ministry, as his special 
representative in the region. And finally, Andrey Kozyrev's trip 
took place. Usually it is the other co-initiator of the "peace 
process" -- the United States -- that displays such verve if, 
like now, unexpected obstacles arise on the path of talks. But 
this time U.S. diplomacy concentrated its efforts on weakening 
the essence of the Palestinian draft UN Security Council 
resolution condemning the massacre in Hebron and listing a set 
of measures to protect the population of the lands occupied by 
Israael. So Moscow's emissaries have acted in proud solitude. 
  It is noteworthy that Russian diplomats also arrived with 
their own ideas, different from the American ones. Essentially, 
they identified with the PLO's stance. "It is necessary to 
ensure extra security for the Palestinians and an international 
presence in the occupied territories," Kozyrev stated in Israel. 
Russia also proposed that all participants in the talks should 
meet again in Madrid in order to sum up the results of the 
"peace process" since October 1991 and give it new impetus. 
  Moscow's proposals on "Madrid 2" have generated a 
contradictory reaction. The PLO has come out in support of the 
proposals, while Israel has rejected them. The United States 
has also expressed its dissatisfaction, and indeed not only with 
the proposals as such, but also with the actual fact of Russia 
taking its own steps. After all, Washington has gotten used to 
hearing only cries of approval from Moscow concerning its 
foreign policy actions. 
  Russia's current activity in the Near East has been greeted 
with approval in the Arab world, if not always in essence, then 
at least in form. The press is noting that for the second time 
this year Moscow is operating independently of Washington -- 
first in Bosnia, and now in the Arab-Israeli conflict. "The 
Russian bear is returning to the international arena," the Saudi 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT states. And not just the Near East, but also 
other areas on our planet have been waiting for this for a long 
time.

it is of fundamental importance that Croatians and Muslims

Peace, Others Political Points"] 
  [Text] Sarajevo -- Life in Sarajevo has taken a radical 
turn toward peace. It coincided with the arrival here of the 
Russian contingent. Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian Federation 
president's special representative for the former Yugoslavia, 
declared this in conversation with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's 
correspondent. He visited the Bosnian capital Sunday during 
another working tour of the region for the purpose of developing 
the peace trend which has become apparent in the city and 
extending it to the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Within the framework of the consultations in Sarajevo the 
Russian diplomat held talks with Alija Izetbegovic, leader of 
the Bosnian Muslims. In Pale he met with Nikola Kolevic, member 
of the leadership of the Bosnian Serb community. Ways to 
develop the peace process after the Croat and Muslim sides 
signed the plans to create a Croat-Muslim federation in Bosnia 
were the object of discussion. 
  Then V. Churkin visited the Russian battalion's billet in 
the 
capital's Vraca district and went to one of the observation 
posts where Russian "blue helmets" are serving. In conversation 
with servicemen the Russian Federation president's special 
representative rated highly the speed with which the battalion 
has settled in in its new location and begun tackling very 
difficult peacemaking tasks. Such effectiveness, he emphasized, 
elicits a feeling of pride in Russia's Armed Forces. 
  Another subject was also touched upon -- the resolution of 
the problems of a psychological kind which the Bosnian Muslim 
side experienced at first in connection with the so unexpected 
arrival of the Russian contingent. As is known, some 
representatives of the Muslim leadership have made nervous and 
at times even irresponsible statements about this. For example, 
they have called the Russian battalion an occupying battalion. 
In Churkin's opinion, this problem has now been eliminated. 
  On the conclusion of his visit to "Rusbat-2," as the Russian 
contingent in Sarajevo is now being called, Vitaliy Churkin once 
again emphasized the importance of Russian participation in UN 
peacemaking operations. Joint service in an important cause 
with the French, the British, and representatives of other 
states, he emphasized, is far more useful for arranging 
cooperation between armies than organizing conferences.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy article under general heading: "Some </F>
Want Peace, Others Political Points"] 
  [Text] During the last days of last week a wave of 
articles swept through both Russian and foreign mass media. 
Their essence may be boiled down to the following sentence: 
Russia is losing its role as first violin in the peacemaking in 
the former Yugoslavia. This is linked to the success of the 
Washington talks on forming a Muslim-Croat federation, as well 
as to the fact that Bosnia's Serbs will not join this 
federation. It was these "surprise discoveries" that made some 
journalists and even politicians say that "the peacemakers' 
laurels are passing from Moscow to Washington." 
  Such statements could even have been ignored owing to their 
scant seriousness in the matter of big-time politics. But they 
are being made at a time of a certain general cooling in 
Russian-U.S. relations and could exacerbate the situation still 
further. Therefore, I believe, it should be clearly decided that 
Russia and Washington cannot compete to see who will earn more 
points out of the tragedy of the Yugoslav peoples. Both great 
powers are doing what they can and what is in their power to end 
the fratricidal war and to restore a just peace in Bosnia as 
quickly as possible. What is more, our countries are agreeing 
and coordinating their efforts between themselves. The Bosnian 
problem, by the way, is one of the most important on the agenda 
of the Vladivostok talks between Andrey Kozyrev and Warren 
Christopher. 
  They really do have something to discuss. Unilateral 
initiatives far from always spell success. For example, that 
federation in Bosnia and the prospects for forming its 
confederation with Croatia. Work on preparing the draft 
constitution of the Bosnian federation was completed Sunday 
under the Americans' patronage in their embassy building in 
Vienna. Its official signing is scheduled for Friday. But it 
is not enough to sign a document, it is necessary to make it 
work. 
  Without Serbian participation (and this will hardly be 
achieved without Russia) in the "divorce process" the vitality 
of the new federation will be in question if only because its 
formation provides for the transfer of 60 percent of Bosnia's 
territory to Muslim and Croat control. Today approximately 70 
percent of the country's territory is in Serb hands. Will they 
agree to voluntary concessions? If so, on what terms? 
  The fact that the federation's creators have left the doors 
to it open for the Bosnian Serbs as well is, most likely, simply 
a political goodwill gesture. It is obvious that the Serbs, if 
the question of their joining anyone at all arises, will choose, 
rather, federal Yugoslavia, the present union of Serbia and 
Montenegro. This decision will have its pluses and its minuses. 
The positive aspects are clearer. The negative aspects are less 
obvious but have more complex consequences: The likelihood of 
forming a new "Greater Serbia" and "Greater Croatia" is fraught 
with a deeper split and growing tension. 
  The resolution of both the present and the long-term 
problems, precisely because of their complexity, requires 
concerted joint actions by all the interested sides, not a race 
to pick up political points and to maintain the image of 
peacemakers.

Armenian counterpart Babken Ararktsyan, their essential

  Russia has always supported and encouraged direct conflicts 
between the warring sides on a realistic basis, he said 
[sentence as received]. 
  In the opinion of the diplomat, vague wordings of the 
cease-fire protocol resulted in close contact of the warring 
units and resumption of fighting. 
  Russia insistently continues mediating efforts and interacts 
with all states and international organizations interested in 
settlement of the Karabakh conflict, stressed the Foreign 
Ministry's spokesman.

  [Text] Moscow March 15 TASS -- The Russian Foreign ministry 
expressed grave concern over the danger of fresh armed clashes 
in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone. The Ministry's chief 
spokesman Grigoriy Karasin told a briefing today that 
"Georgian-Abkhazian relations have got exacerbated recently". 
  According to the spokesman, at the latest round of 
Russian-brokered talks on political settlement in Abkhazia, 
which was held under the U.N. auspices in New York on March 7-9, 
the Georgian side threatened "to go back to war path" unless the 
independence-seeking Abkhazia recognized Georgia's territorial 
integrity and agreed to the return of all ethnic Georgian 
refugees. 
  Karasin stressed that the Russian side was taking "a number 
of urgent steps to prevent fresh fighting in Abkhazia and to 
keep the negotiating process going". 
  Russia will also press for a peacekeeping operation in 
Abkhazia to be carried out by the United Nations or with its 
approval and "resting, if need be, on a Russian military 
contingent", the Foreign Ministry spokesman emphasised.

  [Text] Dismantling the nuclear warheads being withdrawn 
from the territory of Ukraine is an issue which is causing grave 
concern to those involved in the protection of the environment. 
The processing of radioactive materials may cause serious 
damage to the environment. Today, we learned that warheads from 
the Ukrainian missiles are being sent to the town of Arzamas-16. 
Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, the Minister of Natural Resources: 
  [Begin Danilov-Danilyan recording] Only to Arzamas-16. It is 
the enterprise that specializes in these particular things. 
From the point of view of the general safety of Russia it is 
better to bring Ukrainian warheads to Russia, to dismantle them 
and process what they contain, rather than to leave them in 
Ukraine. My honest word; this is better. If another incident 
should occur there, consequences will be far greater than from 
Chernobyl. [end recording]

  [Text] Moscow March 16 BUSINESS-TASS -- Russia's giant 
natural gas supplier Gasprom thinks that a new reduction of gas 
deliveries to Ukraine are "quite likely" in early April. 
  The thing is that Gasprom's European partners get less than 
their due because Ukraine "draws away" some of the gas during 
its transit via Ukrainian territory, sources in Gasprom told 
ITAR-TASS today. 
  The pressure of gas in the pipelines leading to Western 
Europe and particularly to Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey is lower 
than designed although Gasprom has resumed feeding as much gas 
as agreed and more into the pipeline - 470 million cubic meters 
a day. The extra deliveries are designed to compensate Ukraine 
for the termination of natural gas deliveries from Turkmenistan 
(80 million cubic meters a day). 
  Ukraine has failed to conform to one of the most important 
articles of the agreement reached between the Ukrainian 
governmental delegation and the Gasprom leadership. 
  Under the agreement, Gasprom resumed the deliveries of the 
stipulated amount of gas until April 10 pending termination of 
Ukraine's unlicensed use of natural gas from the export pipeline 
passing through Ukraine. Ukraine also promised to work out a 
specific mechanism of repaying its debt for the supplies of gas 
to Ukraine in 1993-1994 and to begin to pay off the debts. 
  Other articles of the agreement also have yet to be 
fulfilled. Ukraine has remitted less than a fraction of one 
percent of its 1.5 trillion arrears to the Gasprom account, and 
according to Russian experts, its financial potential is 
well-nigh exhausted. 
  There is one way of offsetting Ukraine's indebtedness to 
Russia - through the switch to joint ownership of the 
underground gas storage facilities and main gas pipelines on the 
Ukrainian territory, according to Gasprom. Regrettably, the 
agreement in principle on this reached during the negotiations 
in Moscow has met with no support on the part of the Ukrainian 
leadership.

  [Text] It seems as though Moscow and Riga have at long last 
established common ground over the withdrawal of Russian forces. 
  [Correspondent Vlada Vishnevskaya] Today the heads of the 
state delegations at the Russo-Latvian negotiations, Sergey 
Zotov and Martins Virsis, initialled an agreement on the 
conditions and timetable for the withdrawal of Russian forces 
from Latvian territory, an agreement on social security for 
servicemen in the Russian army, military pensioners and members 
of their families, and a treaty on the temporary functioning of 
the Skrunda radar station. 
  So, the bilateral talks which have been going on for two 
years have entered the concluding stage. The delegations have 
managed to reach agreement on the fundamental question, the 
timetable for the withdrawal of forces. Ten thousand Russian 
servicemen will be withdrawn from Latvia by 31 August this year. 
The problem of the lease payment for the use of the Skrunda 
radar remains unresolved. Russia is offering 2 million dollars, 
but this is not acceptable to the Latvians. However, the 
leaders of the delegations believe that these disagreements 
should not affect the final signing of the agreements which were 
initialled today. The documents may be signed when the Russian 
and Latvian presidents meet. According to the head of the 
Russian delegation, this meeting could take place as early as 
April.

Tatarstan and Russia, sent their diplomats to the Permanent 
Mission of the Republic of Tatarstan in Moscow immediately after 
the signing of the bilateral treaty. 
  I.U. Yusupov, Tatarstan's permanent representative in 
Moscow,

treaty's signing. 
  Particular attention was paid during the talks to a 
discussion of this document's international-legal aspects, and 
above all the extensive opportunities the treaty opens up for 
participation in international organizations and the 
establishment and development of direct relations with foreign 
states, including for purposes of concluding agreements.

  [Text] On Tuesday in Moscow talks between the 
prime-ministers of Russia and Poland Viktor Chernomyrdin and 
Waldemar Pawlak were followed by the signing of two agreements: 
on the principles of employment of Russian citizens in Poland 
and Polish citizens in Russia and on a joint anti-monopoly 
policy. 
  According to Chernomyrdin, the main task in economic 
cooperation is to liven up the process, make it faster. He 
admitted stagnation in a number of spheres of bilateral 
relations and said it should be overcome as soon as possible. 
Among such spheres Chernomyrdin named financial relations, the 
question of mutual debts, cooperation in military-technical 
matters and contacts between border areas. 
  The Russian prime-minister stated that concrete officials 
have been appointed who should work out a mechanism of resolving 
these problems by May. The two prime-ministers will meet in May 
in Warsaw to discuss the expansion of cooperation the next stage 
of which should be control over approved agreements and 
decisions. 
  The Polish prime-minister remarked that there is a practical 
foundation now for signing long-term trade and economic 
agreements and an appropriate protocol for this year. He said 
the absence of a decision on the matter of mutual debts on which 
the ministries of finance of the two countries are working 
"should not block economic cooperation". Answering a question 
about the anxiety caused in Poland by the concentration of 
Russian troops in Kaliningrad region the prime-minister said 
that the matter should be left for the presidents of the two 
countries to decide.

  [Text] The German Government will channel DM [German mark] 
65 Mn in 1994 for assistance to ethnic Germans residing in 
Russia, while the Russian Government will set aside Rbs 39 Bn 
for the same purpose, Russia's Minister for Nationalities and 
Regional Policy, Sergey Shakhray, told a news conference in the 
State Duma Tuesday. Recently, Shakhray took part in a meeting of 
the intergovernmental Commission for Russian Germans' issues. 
  According to Shakhray, the Russian delegation confirmed to 
the meeting that Russia was "interested in keeping all Russian 
Germans in Russia." At his assessment, the number of those 
leaving Russia for Germany decreased slightly in 1993. At the 
same time, the number of Germans coming to Russia from Central 
Asian republics and Kazakhstan was bigger than that of emigrants 
to Germany. 
  Shakhray pointed out that the only way for the gradual 
restoration of Russian Germans' statehood was to pass a federal 
law on the creation of new subjects of the Russian Federation in 
areas predominantly populated by Germans. He pointed out that 
the process might take several years. 
  At the same time, Shakhray said the attitude of residents of 
the Volgograd and Saratov regions located along the Volga River, 
where a German autonomous region was planned to be created, had 
become more favorable. These regions used to be a densely 
German-populated area before 1941. 
  Asked whether the draft power-sharing treaty between the 
center and the Kaliningrad region (a Russian exclave located 
between Lithuania and Poland -- IF's note) would be similar to 
the one between Moscow and Kazan, Shakhray said his ministry had 
been instructed by the president and the government to prepare a 
treaty on the issue before April. 
  In Shakhray's opinion, the law on a special status of the 
Kaliningrad region that Federation Council Speaker Vladimir 
Shumeyko had referred to during his trip to the region, "neither 
ran counter, nor precluded such a power-sharing treaty between 
the Kaliningrad region and the Russian Federation." 
  Speaking on the parliamentary elections in Tatarstan, 
Shakhray pointed out that his ministry considered their returns 
to show the approval or disapproval of the treaty between Russia 
and Tatarstan. In his opinion, Tatars' active participation in 
the elections (57.2) was evidence of their support for the 
treaty.

  [Text] A news conference was held for Russian reporters at 
the DPRK Embassy in Moscow on 14 March. Son Song-pil, DPRK 
ambassador to Russia, spoke at the new conference. He briefed 
Pyongyang's position in connection with the North-South talks 
for the exchange of top-level special envoys. 
  Station reporter (Aleksey Kolony) who attended the news 
conference reports: The DPRK ambassador quoted a DPRK Foreign 
Ministry spokesman's 13 March statement. The statement 
indicates that North-South dialogue held to discuss the issue of 
exchanging top-level special envoys has encountered a serious 
barrier recently. 
  Ambassador Son continued to say: "As you know, in the 
DPRK-U.S. contact held recently, an agreement was reached in 
conducting the four-point joint actions simultaneously. That is 
to say, the two sides agreed to put the four points into action 
simultaneously. They are: First, the United States announces 
the suspension of the Team Spirit joint military exercise. 
Second, we receive an inspection to ensure the continuity of 
safeguards. Third, we hold North-South working-level delegates' 
contact for the exchange of special envoys. Fourth, the DPRK 
and the United States hold the third round of the DPRK-U.S. 
talks." 
  Saying that Pyongyang is ready to abide by all problems 
which 
have already been agreed upon, the DPRK ambassador briefed on 
the current situation in North-South dialogue. 
  [Son] "However, the persons in authority of South Korea, 
unlike the attitude they took in the early days of their 
assumption of power, opposed the exchange of special envoys 
simply because we proposed it. They opposed [words indistinct]. 
However, giving in to our strong demand and the Korean people's 
pressure calling for holding North-South dialogue, they 
reluctantly responded to the working-level contact for the 
exchange of special envoys. 
  Proceeding from our will to create a good atmosphere for the 
realization of the exchange of special envoys, we proposed the 
following four demands at the fourth working-level contact: 
First, the suspension of all large-scale nuclear military 
exercises. Second, the renouncement of the international 
alliance system in connection with our so-called nuclear 
problem. Third, the suspension of the plan to deploy Patriot 
missiles to South Korea. Fourth, the cancellation of the remarks 
by the person in authority in South Korea that he cannot shake 
hands with a counterpart who possesses nuclear weapons. We 
proposed the above because we believed these issues should be 
resolved first in order to provide favorable circumstances for 
the working-level contact on the exchange of special envoys to 
proceed amid an atmosphere of mutual trust between the North and 
the South." 
  In conclusion, responding to the station reporter's question 
about the prospects of the North-South dialogue, DPRK Ambassador 
Son Song-pil said: "Problems seem complicated. However, they 
are actually not complicated. Who complicates problems? It is 
precisely the South Korean authorities and the United States. 
The pressing issue that should be solved between the DPRK and 
the United States at present is the nuclear issue. As I said 
earlier, the South Korean authorities are not in a position to 
edge themselves into this issue. 
  What the U.S. side needs to do is withdraw U.S. nuclear 
bases 
and nuclear weapons from South Korea and renounce its 
large-scale military and nuclear threats and hostile policy 
against us. In return for this, we will receive nuclear 
inspections. Thus, the United States and we should resolve 
problems, and others should not be involved in this. Therefore, 
the issue of solving the nuclear issue through a package 
settlement should be solved first through the talks between the 
United States and us. If the United States removes its nuclear 
weapons from South Korea, thereby removing the nuclear threat 
against us, a package settlement of the nuclear issue will be 
realized and the basic issues between us and the United States 
will be eliminated anyway."

rubric: "Korean Peninsula To Be Nuclear-Free?"] 
  [Text] In the last few days there have been encouraging 
signs of prospects for pacification on the Korean peninsula and 
for turning it into a nuclear-free zone, a statement by the 
Russian Society for Friendship and Cultural Cooperation With the 
DPRK says. An International Atomic Energy Agency inspection of 
North Korean nuclear facilities has begun. High-level talks on 
exchanging special envoys between North and South have been 
resumed. South Korea and the United States have desisted from 
holding the provocative "Team Spirit-94" joint military 
maneuvers. Finally, an agreement has been reached on resuming 
the third round of the North Korean-U.S. talks in Geneva on 21 
March this year. All this gives rise to hope of a solution to 
the so-called nuclear question, that is to say the question of 
ridding the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons. 
  But this is quite obviously only the beginning of a general 
process of achieving nonnuclear status for Northeast Asia. It 
must not be forgotten that the country behind all the 
insinuations regarding nuclear developments in North Korea is 
above all none other than Japan, which has for a long time been 
secretly forcing the pace in nuclear missile weapons development 
and production. Therefore Northeast Asia, naturally including 
the Korean peninsula, can be reliably rid of nuclear weapons 
only if Japan conscientiously joins the nonnuclear process. 
  The Russian Society for Friendship and Cultural Cooperation 
With the DPRK, like all the Korean people's real friends, 
energetically supports all sides' efforts toward nuclear 
regulation on the Korean peninsula and expresses its confidence 
that they will end in success.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1615 GMT on 28 February carries a 30-minute 
documentary entitled "Being a Foreigner." This is the first 
installment of a three-part documentary series on Soviet 
intelligence agents working abroad. Part one is labelled "Line 
N." 
  The program begins with an interview with G. M. 
Nechiporenko, 
a former KGB colonel, who spoke about his 40-year career in 
intelligence work. He says that in the Soviet era, illegal 
intelligence activities were called "Line N," and the methods 
used were always the same, that all intelligence operatives 
carried out the tasks given to them by "the state machine." 
  The program next shows the shadowy figure of a man seen in 
profile, speaking in accented Russian about his career. A 
caption on his image says that former Soviet intelligence agents 
were filmed for this program. 
  The documentary next gives some historical background on 
Soviet intelligence operatives employed under Stalin, and gives 
the histories of several, including Rudolf Abel, who worked in 
the United States, a man with the pseudonym "Ben", who spied on 
the British nuclear submarine program, and "Sam" and "Julietta", 
a married couple working abroad. 
  Yuriy Drozdov, a major-general in the KGB and the former 
head 
of illegal intelligence, is interviewed next. He discusses the 
types of people who worked for him, and he says that one person 
was "even a foreign ambassador in another foreign state." Next 
there is a clip from an interview with George Blake, who is 
captioned as a "former agent for British, then Soviet 
intelligence." Later, there is a profile of Pavel Sudoplatov, 
who was the former head of the KGB's Fourth Directorate in 
charge of sabotage. 
  The next section of the documentary concerns the 
assassination of Trotskiy by the First Main Directorate of the 
NKVD, the former Soviet intelligence organization. This is 
followed by Colonel Nechiporenko talking about his work in 
Leipzig, and he claims that the KGB would use Leipzig as a ford 
for getting spies into the West, and that Germany was used as a 
training ground. This is followed by Abel, "Sam," and 
"Julietta" discussing their history and their methods of 
tradecraft. 
  At 1605 GMT on 9 March, Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian shows part two of the "Being a Foreigner" documentary 
series. This 30-minute part is called "Born in the Cemetery." 
  At the start of this program, KGB Colonel Gleb Nechiporenko 
speaks about the need to provide a spy with a complete false 
background identity including date of birth, place of birth, 
schooling, education, marriage, relatives, etc. This 
information is gleaned from old newspapers, library records, and 
gravestones. The narrator then goes on to mention briefly the 
false identities used by various Soviet illegals. Abel used the 
identity of the American Emile Goldfus; "Ben" used the identity 
of a Canadian Gordon Lonsdale; Peter Kroger obtained his 
identity in a New Zealand cemetery; "Sam" and "Julietta" changed 
their places of residence and birthplaces several times. Only 
the mysterious (?Ramzay), the code name for Richard Sorge, was 
born in the actual place where he claimed to be. 
  Next, there are brief interviews with Boris Gudz, a former 
counter-intelligence agent, Major-General Mikhail Ivanov, and 
KGB Maj.-Gen. Yuriy Popov who recall the case of the Soviet 
illegal Richard Sorge. Footage shown of decoded messages to the 
Red Army from Richard Sorge signed "Ramzay". Sorge had been 
trusted by the Germans despite the fact that he did not conceal 
that he was born in Baku and had worked for the Comintern. Nor 
was Sorge suspected by the Japanese, since he was working for 
their fascist ally. The operation involving Richard Sorge's 
work as an illegal had been carefully planned in advance, 
including the fact that his name had not been changed. 
  Brief screen interviews follow with Mikhail Fedorov, "Sam", 
and Galina Fedorova, "Julietta", who claim that their activity 
is not immoral. Next, Gleb Nechiporenko's younger brother, Oleg 
Nechiporenko, who is also an intelligence operative, is 
profiled. The narrator says that he was once regarded by the CIA 
as one of the best KGB operatives in South America. The 
narrator also says that shortly before the assassination of 
President Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald visited the Soviet Embassy 
and sought permission to leave Mexico for the USSR and that Oleg 
was one of the last diplomats to see Oswald. Historical 
information on Oswald is presented. 
  To conclude the second part of the series, several KGB 
officials discuss tradecraft, especially false documentation. 
  The third and final part of the documentary series "Being a 
Foreigner" is broadcast by Moscow Russian Television in Russian 
at 1615 GMT on 11 March. This 30-minute part is entitled "After 
the Legend." 
  To open, a pipe-smoking figure shown in profile says that 
simple things like the way one cooks are used to convince people 
that you are the nationality you claim to be as an illegal. He 
adds that it is a very rare thing for people to speak a foreign 
language without some kind of accent. Gleb Nechiporenko then is 
shown, and he displays various airport stamps used in forging 
documents. He shows examples of various airport stamps and a 
forged GDR passport visa. He is shown practicing the forgery of 
a signature. 
  Nechiporenko says the intelligence services were engaged in 
the aftermath of the 1956 events in Hungary. Throughout the 
world footage and photographs of those events by Western 
journalists were studied closely to bring culprits to book. 
Nechiporenko denies any idea that this was an improper task for 
intelligence services to be engaged on. 
  The documentary then returns to the subject of tradecraft. 
This includes brief interviews with the Fedorovs, "Sam" and 
"Julietta". It then shows that Gleb Nechiporenko served as a 
vice consul in London, where he was also worked in intelligence. 
His tasks could include purchasing several English hats, for 
instance, for use by illegals. Asked what kind of person he 
would want to send to Britain to work as an illegal, 
Nechiporenko said he would not send someone to pose as an 
Englishman. That would be too risky. He would send someone 
with excellent English but whose accent would not be suspect. 
For instance he could be a person with an American passport 
hailing from Latin America, for whom a slight accent would be 
natural. 
  Next, further historical background in given on the case of 
Rudolf Abel. Pavel Sudoplatov is shown in a cemetery viewing 
Rudolf Abel's gravestone, which also bears his other name 
"Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher". Evelina Fisher, Rudolf Abel's 
daughter, is briefly interviewed. 
  KGB Maj.-Gen. Yuriy Popov explains that illegals were 
dispatched to America during the fifties to be there in case 
there should be a war. KGB Maj.-Gen. Yuriy Drozdov, who was 
formerly the head of illegal intelligence, recalls how Abel was 
betrayed and arrested. Next, Western footage of various arrested 
Soviet illegals, including Klaus Fuchs, is shown. Evelina 
Fisher, Abel's daughter, says that her father considered a long 
absence when he was recalled to the Soviet Union in 1955 as one 
of the reasons for his downfall. He regarded a second return to 
America as dangerous in itself. Sudoplatov says that the mistake 
was that Abel returned to his studio for money. The 1962 
exchange of Abel for Gary Powers in Germany is then discussed. 
Drozdov recalls how the actual exchange took place. 
Afterwards, exchanges were handled differently, and footage 
shows the Krogers boarding an aircraft. One big difference with 
this exchange was in the publicity given in the West and East. 
The Krogers's departure was extensively covered in the West, but 
no photographers were around to cover their arrival in Moscow. 
Greville Wynne's arrival by air in the West was widely 
publicized, but the arrival of Lonsdale, or Molody,as he was 
also known, went unpublicized in Moscow. 
  The next part of the documentary deals with how the 
technology has changed, but the tasks remain the same. Gleb and 
Oleg Nechiporenko speak about hidden weapon caches. The 
narrator recalls the details of the Lonsdale spy case in which 
Houghton and others passed on top secret British naval data to 
"Ben", otherwise known as Lonsdale and Molody. KGB Colonel 
Yuriy Mostinskiy explains that after the return home of 
ex-illegals, attention is paid to their spiritual welfare and 
efforts are made to make use of the knowledge they have of the 
opponents' counterintelligence methods. The narrator says that 
very often these illegals pay a high price for being engaged in 
their work. Sorge was hanged, and others have undergone lengthy 
terms of imprisonment. The documentary concludes with the 
narrator saying that despite this, none of them have regretted 
their work as illegals.

  [Text] There is no getting away from the fact that Russia 
plays a special role in the former Soviet Republics and feels 
responsibility toward them, said Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
on Tuesday during his visit to the 12th frontier station of the 
Pyandzh unit of border guards protecting Tajikistan's border 
with Afghanistan. 
  Addressing a group of Russian journalists accompanying him, 
he said that if Russia leaves Tajikistan, the republic may come 
to face the fate of neighboring Afghanistan. "Afghanistan was 
invaded by the former USSR. It's a different matter here. 
Relationships, ethnic and historic traditions, are quite 
different in Tajikistan. We must not go away from there. If 
this frontier is exposed, chaos will begin," the foreign 
minister said. 
  Russia, he pointed out, "has no other option than to 
continue 
strengthening the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan." 
"Our frontier guards do their job while some people discourse on 
Russian "neo-imperialism" or, on the contrary, on "total 
withdrawal." They seal the border with risk to their lives. 
Sometime they resort to arms, and rightly. When you are 
attacked, you must retaliate. To leave and abandon everything 
here would be disgraceful and irresponsible," Kozyrev stressed. 
  In answer to a question from Interfax's correspondent the 
head of Russian diplomacy said that he is "cautiously optimistic 
about the future of the Tajik-Afghan border." "This optimism is 
based primarily on the endeavors to consolidate Tajikistan's 
statehood and expand its social base. The border will be 
strengthened accordingly," Kozyrev said. 
  With reference to the dialog between Tajik factions, the 
Russian foreign minister said that "in fact it has already 
begun, with Russia's mediation too." "Formulas for this dialog 
will be readjusted yet. Maybe a general conference or forum 
will take place some time and gather everyone; maybe the dialog 
will continue on bilateral basis," he said. 
  According to Kozyrev, "it's essential to understand what the 
Tajik opposition is like, since it is extremely diverse." "The 
main thing is that the dialog between Tajik factions should 
contribute to resolving the situation; whether it is a general 
forum or separate consultations is of minor importance," he 
said.

  [Text] Moscow March 16 TASS -- Former Russian 
Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy, in a statement sent to 
ITAR-TASS on the eve of the third anniversary of March 17, 1991, 
referendum, during which most citizens voted for the 
preservation of the Soviet Union, has called for the recreation 
of the erstwhile unity of the former Soviet Union but warned 
this is impossible to do through bloodshed. 
  "Only through indomitable will and fortitude of the 
fraternal 
peoples and a desire to live together, we shall be able to 
attain the cherished goal or we shall get lost one by one," the 
statement said. 
  Rutskoy believes that over the past three years "the reality 
itself proved that the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) 
is non-viable" and that "the people have come to realise in full 
the price of the irresponsible and light-minded decision to 
dismantle the Soviet Union". 
  At the same time the former vice-president is convinced it 
is 
impossible to prevent the country "from slipping down into an 
abyss through meetings, demonstrations and irresponsible 
statements that border on a political provocation". 
  Rutskoy considers it necessary to comprehend this and look 
for more effective forms for rapprochement and cooperation in an 
atmosphere of an intensifying disintegration, economic, social 
and political crisis. He did not specify what forms he had in 
mind.

<F P=106> [Feliks Babitskiy report under "Situation" rubric: "To Each </F>
Opponent -- a Political Double"] 
  [Text] Two weeks have now passed since the declaration of 
the sensational February amnesty, but the disputes surrounding 
the question of who needed it and why have still not died down. 
Most likely several political intrigues have clashed here, and 
their resultant force, so to speak, has apparently not satisfied 
anyone. 
  First of all, the desire of the Duma leadership to 
demonstrate its independence of the president to the whole world 
and primarily to itself is completely obvious. No less obvious 
is the worry of certain parliamentarians that the possible trial 
of the "October prisoners" may stir up the electorate's interest 
in them on the eve of the presidential elections. On the other 
hand, unlike Zyuganov and Zhirinovskiy, Anpilov and Rutskoy were 
never professionals in political terms. And therefore, having 
been pardoned opportunely by the charity (and, clearly, it is 
only the powers that be that can be charitable) of these people, 
and having discovered their previous natural niche already 
filled, they would be forced, according to the cunning 
reckonings of the parliamentarians, to quietly and ingloriously 
leave big-time politics. This danger was obvious even from the 
Lefortovo cell from which Rutskoy, according to rumors, had told 
his supporters in the Duma not to even hint at any amnesty. 
  However, the events following the amnesty have shown that 
even Boris Yeltsin is not at all inclined to oppose it. Thus, 
the leaders of the "Russia's Choice" movement, who include many 
first-class lawyers and legislators with experience of working 
in the previous Union and Russian parliaments, have found a 
great multitude of contraventions of existing legislation in the 
document adopted by the Duma. It would, apparently, be as easy 
as anything to suspend its effect and lodge a complaint in the 
Constitutional Court.... But nothing of the sort has happened. 
On the contrary, the executive has done all it can to ensure 
that the legislature's decision is irreversible. 
  Is not the whole point that the president too has been able 
to come out of this with something? 
  Once again this cannot be ruled out. Even the "Yabloko" 
faction has condemned the amnesty, arguing that by discontinuing 
the criminal proceedings against the defenders of the "White 
House" the parliament is thus removing responsibility from the 
opposing side, whose stance during the October events did not 
appear to be irreproachable to everyone either. 
  And then, Boris Nikolayevich could easily count on the fact 
that each of his opponents will obtain a political double and, 
instead of opposing him, would be forced to prove to the voter 
his own self-identity. After all, it is no secret that at the 
December elections Zyuganov got into the parliament by 
inheriting Anpilov's electorate, and Zhirinovskiy -- Rutskoy's. 
However, it now turns out that they were written off too early, 
and they are now demanding back again what is theirs. 
  I think that this state of affairs suits the president. 
After all, it is no secret to anyone today that there are no 
legal obstacles to holding extraordinary presidential elections. 
And so the only thing that can really avert them is a split in 
the anti-Yeltsin camp.

<F P=106> ["Text" of decree by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on </F>
cancellation of Crimean poll] 
  [Text] We have just received a decree by the president of 
Ukraine, which is titled: On the Decree of the President of the 
Republic of Crimea, Dated 10 March 1994, on Conducting a Poll of 
Citizens of the Republic of Crimea on 27 March 1994. The decree 
states that the president of the Crimean Republic adopted, on 10 
March 1994, Decree No. 05 on conducting a poll of citizens of 
the Republic of Crimea on 27 March 1994 on issues of renewing 
the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea, 
dated 6 May 1992, that determined the regulation of mutual 
relations between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine on the 
basis of a treaty, and agreements and renewing the provisions of 
the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea, dated 6 May 1992, 
which declared the right of citizens of the Republic of Crimea 
to dual citizenship. The mentioned provisions of the decree of 
the president of the Republic of Crimea contravene Ukraine's 
Constitution and the law of Ukraine on an all-Ukrainian and 
local referendums. 
  The president of the Republic of Crimea has virtually made a 
decision to hold a [words indistinct] poll of citizens of a 
consultative referendum under the guise of a poll of citizens 
that is being conducted only in order to ascertain public 
opinion that is specified by Article 47 of the law of Ukraine on 
an all-Ukrainian and local referendums. According to the 
legislation of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea, the results 
of such a referendum are to be considered, and must be taken 
into account when decisions are made by relevant state bodies. 
  Such a conclusion is based, first of all, on the preamble of 
the decree. In it, the president of the Republic of Crimea 
noted firstly, that in adopting the decision he is relying on 
the principle of sovereignty of the people, [narodovladdya] in 
accordance with which the single source of state power of the 
Republic of Crimea are the people; secondly, the aim of the 
decree is to take into account more fully the will of the 
citizens of the Republic of Crimea when deciding important state 
issues; thirdly, it is guided by Article 2 and 34 of the 
Constitution of the Republic of Crimea where it speaks about the 
implementation of state power by the people and its 
participation in managing the affairs of society and state. 
  (?In accordance with) Article 46 of the Ukrainian law on an 
all-Ukrainian and local referendums, the manifestation of the 
will of citizens when deciding important issues of a general 
state and local significance is a consultative poll of citizens 
through a consultative referendum. According to Points 1 and 2 
of Article 2 of the decree, citizens of the Republic of Crimea 
are recommended to reply to a question on the constitutional 
bases of mutual relations between the Republic of Crimea and 
Ukraine, and the rights of citizens of the Republic of Crimea to 
dual citizenship, that is to say, to questions that are 
exclusively under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine, [according to] Articles 31 Points 2 and 15, and Article 
97 of Ukraine's Constitution that are, therefore, subject to an 
all-Ukrainian referendum according to Article Three of the 
Ukrainian law on an all-Ukrainian and local referendums. 
  In accordance with Article 6-1 of the Ukrainian law on an 
all-Ukrainian and local referendums, the holding of referendums 
on issues that are not under the jurisdiction of the Republic of 
Crimea is not permitted. An adoption, a change, or a 
cancellation of a decision on issues that have been referred to 
the jurisdiction of the Republic of Crimea by Ukrainian 
legislation may be the subject of a republican and local 
referendums in the Republic of Crimea (Article 3-1 of the 
Ukrainian law on an all-Ukrainian and local referendums). In 
addition, it must be taken into account that the provisions of 
Article 9 and Part 2 of Article 17 of the Constitution of the 
Republic of Crimea in the version dated 6 May 1992, whose 
renewal has been touched upon in the decree of the president of 
the Republic of Crimea, were changed by the Supreme Council of 
the Republic of Crimea on 25 September 1992, insofar as they did 
not conform to the Constitution of Ukraine. 
  In addition, the fact that certain provisions of the decree 
of the president of the Republic of Crimea do not conform to 
Crimean legislation is also mentioned in a resolution from the 
Central Electoral Commission on the election of the Supreme 
Council of the Republic of Crimea, dated 12 March 1994, 
concerning the aforementioned decree. Proceeding from this, and 
in accordance with Point 7-2 of Article 114-5 of the 
Constitution of Ukraine, I resolve: 
  1. To cancel Points 1 and 2 of Article 2 of the decree of 
the 
president of the Republic of Crimea dated 10 March 1994 No. 05 
on conducting a poll of citizens of the Republic of Crimea on 27 
March 1994, insofar as it does not conform with the Constitution 
of Ukraine and the law of Ukraine on an all-Ukrainian and local 
referendums; 
  2. The decree acquires validity from the date of signing.

  [Text] [Announcer] At least two states, Russia and Ukraine, 
are closely watching how the sociopolitical situation in Crimea 
is developing. As is known, on 27 March, the elections of 
deputies to the Republic's Supreme Soviet will take place; but 
this will not be the only thing happening. The recently elected 
President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov has made his amendments to the 
election campaign by signing on 10 March a decree which provides 
for the people of Crimea to be polled simultaneously. Yevgeniy 
Novikov has the details from Simferopol. 
  [Novikov] According to the presidential decree, Crimea's 
citizens are to reply to three questions on 27 March: whether it 
is necessary to restore the 6 May 1992 Crimean Constitution 
which provides for the interrelations between Crimea and Ukraine 
to be regulated on the basis of a bilateral treaty; whether the 
people of Crimea are entitled to dual citizenship; and whether 
the Crimean president's decrees should be granted the force of 
law. 
  Taking into account the Crimeans' active support for Yuriy 
Meshkov's policy, there is no doubt that all three questions 
will be answered in the affirmative and this will enable the 
Crimean president to take a tougher stance at the talks with 
Ukraine and to receive commanding powers in Crimea analogous to 
President Yeltsin's powers in Russia. 
  However, the Central Electoral Commission took the liberty 
of 
disagreeing with the president's decree and adopted Special 
Resolution No 21. The Central Electoral Commission's resolution 
says that polling of Crimea's citizens is not envisaged by the 
law on elections and that the president, in appointing his 
representatives to the Central Electoral Commission, has grossly 
violated the Republic's Constitution and therefore must bring 
his decree in line with the legislation in force, that is to 
say, the decree should actually be abolished. 
  Legal experts are now urgently working on resolving the 
conflict which has arisen. On the one hand, Meshkov was indeed 
too late in giving notice about the poll that was being 
prepared. On the other hand, the Central Electoral Commission 
has no legitimate grounds for instructing the president what he 
should do. 
  For the time being it is also not clear whether the poll of 
Crimea's citizens will take place on 27 March. It is unclear 
what the legal consequences are of such a poll. 
  Meanwhile, Yuriy Meshkov has signed one more decree on the 
dissolution of Crimea's Council of Ministers. The decree is 
perfectly in line with the Crimean Constitution, but runs 
counter to Ukraine's Constitution. Ukraine president's aid 
Mykola Mykhalchenko expressed the hope that Crimea's Supreme 
Soviet would not agree with Yuriy Meshkov's unconstitutional 
actions. However, Crimea's parliament did not find anything 
unconstitutional in the president's actions. 
  Time will tell how events will develop further, but it is 
obvious that relations between Crimea and Ukraine are again 
beginning to worsen.

  [Text] The state delegation which participated in the 
interstate talks on the withdrawal of the Russian army from 
Latvia returned from Moscow yesterday evening. Our 
correspondent Ainars Asaks spoke to the head of the delegation, 
Martins Virsis, at Riga airport: 
  [Begin Virsis recording] We initialled four documents -- one 
treaty and three agreements concerning army withdrawal. We did 
not agreed on the question of payment for the use of the Skrunda 
facility. This problem remains unsolved at this time. As far 
as the contentious issue of military pensioners is concerned, 
then the formula for a compromise is the following: The concept 
[of military pensioners] comprises the people who lived in 
Latvia until 28 January 1992. The amount of the pension is not 
in the competence of the Republic of Latvia, because Russia pays 
the pensions. We cannot instruct Russia about what pensions it 
pays. That is not at the concern of the Latvian taxpayer. 
  The deadline for the [Russian] army's withdrawal will be 31 
August 1994. This treaty will obviously have to be put forward 
to the Latvian and the Russian governments. The Russian side 
will put it forward to its government and we -- to our 
government. The governments will then approve them [as heard] 
and then they can be signed and after the signing naturally 
follows the ratification procedure. [end recording]

  [Text]The Latvian national bank plans to keep its eyes 
peeled on the money supply to avert price hike and cut inflation 
to 10 percent in 1994, the bank's President Einars Repse said. 
  In 1993, the inflation ran a comparatively low 34.9 percent, 
Repse told the economic development seminar at the Economics 
Ministry. 
  Only some of East European countries, like the Czech 
Republic 
(18 percent) and Slovakia (23 percent), reported lower inflation 
rate than Latvia last year, Repse said. 
  The Bank of Latvia's main short-term goals are stabilizing 
of 
prices and currency, and raising credibility in the national 
currency, the lat, said Repse. 
  Latvia managed to stop the decline in its gross domestic 
product in 1993, Repse noted. 
  The central bank is aware of the negative impact of the 
national currency revaluation on the export opportunities, said 
Repse. It preserved a stable currency market by preventing sharp 
increase and fluctuations in the lat rate. 
  The measures helped the Baltic country to lead its foreign 
trade balance back in the black, Repse said. 
  On the other hand, Repse conceded that the economy reacts 
inflexibly to changes in currency rates. The chances of market 
relations are not fully used in Latvia yet, he added. 
  Commenting on the influx of convertible currencies into 
Latvia, Repse said that the acquired reserves would allow to 
avoid sharp fluctuations in the lat rate and grant some safety 
to the national currency in the future.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondent Andrey Sitov] </F>
  [Text] Tajikistan, 15 Mar TASS -- "This is the Tajik 
border -- a border of the Commonwealth -- but it will not do 
without our presence. We have a historic mission, whose 
nonfulfilment would be a betrayal. If our border guards leave 
the border, bloodshed will begin and innocent people will be 
killed," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told 
correspondents here today. 
  The minister visited a border post of the Pyandzh border 
unit 
during a break in the current Dushanbe conference of foreign 
ministers from Central Asia, Kazakhstan and Russia. 
  Kozyrev told ITAR-TASS that Russian presence in former 
Soviet 
Republics was discussed in this very light during his meeting 
with U.S. State Secretary Warren Christopher on Monday [14 
March] in Vladivostok. 
  "The Russian special mission is not our caprice, it is a 
fact 
one cannot avoid. We do not need any imperialism, but we will 
fulfill our duty. I think that our Western partners come to 
understand this. It will be fine if they help us, if not we 
will make it ourselves," stressed the official. 
  Asked whether inter-Tajik dialogue will be held in Moscow in 
due time, the minister said that the dialogue has begun, 
including that with the Russian mediation. "It is important to 
understand that the dialogue may have diverse forms. It is the 
result that is important, and in order to achieve it, it is 
necessary to find out who's who: Who has the guns and who has 
real control over armed people. It is they whom one should 
speak to first," he added. 
  Asked what the reason is for his frequent meetings with the 
military, Kozyrev said: "We have a common cause although 
different means. This cause is consolidation of statehood and 
protection of Russian interests."

<F P=106> [Interview with acting Tajik President Rakhmonov by Igor </F>
Lenskiy, in Dushanbe, date not given: "Emomili Rakhmonov: 
Talks Are Possible But Not With Criminals"] 
  [Text] Emomili Rakhmonov is the youngest of the leaders of 
the countries of the former USSR. He is 41 years old. He was 
born in the settlement of Dangara in Kulyab Oblast. He began 
his working life as an electrician at a creamery. He served in 
the Army for three years. He graduated as an economist from the 
Tajik State University. He was elected chairman of the trade 
union and later director at his local sovkhoz, the sovkhoz named 
for V.I. Lenin. During the civil war in 1992 he was one of the 
organizers of the Kulyab antifundamentalist resistance. He led 
the Kulyab Oblast Soviet Executive Committee. On 19 November 
1992, he was elected chairman of the Tajikistan Supreme Council. 
  [Lenskiy] Esteemed Emomili Sharipovich, it has been over a 
year now since the people of Tajikistan, under the leadership of 
their lawfully elected government, managed to bring the civil 
war to an end and embark on the path of a peaceful life. How do 
you assess the political situation in the Republic today and how 
is the constitutional process, which your speech at the December 
session of the Supreme Council launched, developing? 
  [Rakhmonov] The political situation in the Republic today is 
relatively stable if you compare it with what was happening a 
year ago, when the civil war ended. The unhealthy passions in 
society are dying down. There is, however, a rise in the crime 
rate. Some 25,000 crimes have been committed in the Republic 
over the year. Three out of every four remain unsolved. 
Furthermore, this situation is typical today not just of 
Tajikistan, but of all the CIS countries. Although, to be 
honest, the recognition of this fact offers scant comfort. 
  A constitutional commission is at work right now. Work on a 
new draft constitution is proceeding successfully. A nationwide 
discussion of the document in planned for June. After the 
adoption of the fundamental law, there will be elections to a 
new parliament and possibly an election for president of the 
republic. The question of the presidency must be resolved at 
the same time as the adoption of the constitution. 
  New political forces are coming to the fore -- the People's 
Party and the Party of Economic and Democratic Transformations, 
which have applied for registration to the Republic's Justice 
Ministry. But at the moment the largest parties in terms of 
numbers and social weight are still the Communist Party and the 
Youth League of Tajikistan. 
  We have agreed to political dialogue with representatives of 
the antigovernment opposition. The talks are due to take place 
in Moscow, with the Russian and UN representatives taking part. 
  [Lenskiy] On what terms is Russia prepared to create a 
single ruble zone with Tajikistan? 
  [Rakhmonov] Russia has not presented us with any impossible 
conditions. Talks are being held on the usual topics -- 
traditional mutual trade relations. First of all ,we must 
restore Tajik cotton shipments to Russia to their former volume. 
It must be stated with regret that annual cotton production has 
halved now. 
  It is also necessary to consider increasing the proportion 
of 
Russian capital in our Republic's economy. I am talking about 
the flotation of enterprises originally built using Russian 
technology, enterprises such as the "Vostokredmet" Association, 
or the Rogunskaya Hydroelectric Power Station, currently under 
construction. New forms for organizing production units via 
international flotation are perfectly acceptable in these 
circumstances. 
  [Lenskiy] The CIS Collective Peacemaking Forces [CPF] have 
been performing their duties in the Republic at the Tajik 
Government's invitation for six months now. What is your 
assessment of their activity? 
  [Rakhmonov] The role of the CPF should not be overestimated 
or underestimated. It would be naive to suppose that their 
introduction into the Republic's territory would immediately 
bring border violations to an end. Our enemies across the 
Pyandzha have regrettably not abandoned their intentions. 
However, they now face greater obstacles to the realization of 
their criminal schemes. The CPF have become a firm barrier along 
the Tajik-Afghan border, which is 1,300 km long. 
  With Russia's assistance we are taking measures to resolve 
the problem by political means. I have in mind the forthcoming 
dialogue with opposition representatives, due to take place in 
Moscow. I have repeatedly noted that such a dialogue is 
necessary. The only condition was the need to define the 
potential parties to the talks. I did not want to sit at the 
same table as people who are under investigation for committing 
crimes against their own people. 
  We want a peaceable, constructive discussion with those 
people who are genuinely interested in improving the situation 
in Tajikistan and who are ready to put their ambitions aside for 
the sake of the people's well-being. 
  [Lenskiy] Instability is the main cause of the suitcase 
mentality among the Slavs. What could be done, in your view, to 
stop the migration of the Russian-speaking population? 
  [Rakhmonov] Yes, the exodus of the Russian-speaking 
population is continuing, unfortunately. Even though we are 
making every effort to hold on to specialists and indeed people 
who are simply second- and third-generation citizens of 
Tajikistan. Through the press I have appealed to those who have 
left to return home. The conditions for this do exist. 
Hostilities on the republic's territory have ceased. 
  The government is now trying to resolve the problem of 
protecting the interests and guaranteeing the rights of the 
nonindigenous population. Under the Tajik-Russian Treaty signed 
in May 1993 it is planned to open a Slavic university in 
Tajikistan. The only problem is resources, which we lack at the 
moment. 
  [Lenskiy] What about dual citizenship? 
  [Rakhmonov] Well, it is too soon to talk about that at the 
moment.... 
  [Lenskiy] Sooner or later Tajikistan's defense capability 
will become your internal affair. How is the formation of the 
National Army proceeding? 
  [Rakhmonov] We believe that a sovereign Republic must have 
its own Armed Forces. In this regard we are being helped by 
Russia and other fraternal CIS Republics. We have created a 
Defense Ministry here and we have subunits of special-purpose 
troops and internal troops. 
  But only the initial, preparatory stage in the creation of 
the People's Army of Tajikistan has been completed. An air 
force helicopter squadron has been formed, a training brigade is 
being formed, and a military school is being organized in 
Khudzhand along the lines of the Suvorov School. The Sangak 
Safarov Military College is already in operation. 
  [Lenskiy] It is exactly a year since the legendary Sangak 
died. How do you assess his personality and activity today? 
  [Rakhmonov] I have deep respect for the memory of the 
chairman of the People's Front of Tajikistan. May he rest in 
peace. Sangak Safarov accomplished a great deed for his people 
and in that sense his name now stands among those of the 
people's heroes of Tajikistan. I now derive strength for my 
work from our people among whom, I believe, there are quite a 
few outstanding individuals like Sangak. 
  [Lenskiy] Recently Tajikistan was shaken by the 
assassination of M. Nazarshoyev, deputy chairman of the Council 
of Ministers, who hailed from the Pamirs. What effect could 
this have on the situation in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast? 
  [Rakhmonov] Quite recently, even before the tragic event, I 
flew to Khorog where I took part in a discussion of topical 
problems. The plan is to allocate to the oblast a long-term 
preferential credit totaling 22 billion rubles. The state 
budget is also financing the rebuilding of roads, bridges, and 
other facilities which have been wrecked. We are trying to 
speed up the commissioning of small-scale hydroelectric power 
stations in the Pamirs. 
  The civil war brought the construction of the 
Kulyab-Kalaykhum highway to a halt. It is meant for the 
transport of economic freight to the Pamirs. Furthermore, this 
road is capable of functioning all year round. Ten km of 
asphalt still has to be laid in the mountains. 
  I understand that some people do not like good relations 
with 
Gornyy Badakhshan. They would prefer confrontation with the 
Republic's government. This is confirmed by the provocative 
murder of Moyensho Nazarshoyev, deputy chairman of the 
government, by enemies of the Tajik people. The Prosecutor's 
Office has established that this was the handiwork of the Mullah 
Kasym gang, which is inspired to acts of terror and violence by 
Said Abdullo Nuri, head of the so-called "government in exile." 
That is how they are "preparing" for talks. 
  But despite the provocateurs' plans, the population of the 
autonomous oblast is opposed to separatism.

  [Text] Tajikistan would adhere to the ways of economic 
reforms and was steadily searching for the ways of overcoming 
the crisis as soon as possible, said Abdujalil Samadov, the head 
of the government of the Republic, at a news conference that was 
held for local and foreign journalists in Dushanbe, today. 
  The news conference was devoted to the results of the 
nine-day visit of Samadov to the Russian Federation, Germany, 
Switzerland, Great Britain, and the United States. 
  Tajikistan can not resolve the difficult issues of 
restoration of the national economy and ensuring the steady 
activity of its branches alone. 
  Samadov said that the main aim of his visit to these 
countries was to familiarize the officials of these countries 
with the real situation of the Republic. The international 
financial organizations, businessmen, and entrepreneurs do 
understand our difficulties and demands very well and they are 
ready to invest in order to implement the specific difficulties. 
However, they give priority to stabilization of the political 
situation in Tajikistan. The important thing is that foreign 
entrepreneurs support the program of economic reforms submitted 
by our Republic. 
  Abdujalil Samadov added that important events would take 
place in the country in the current year. These are, first of 
all, the nationwide referendum on the form of the state 
administration, the free Parliamentary elections, and the 
leadership of the country, nationwide discussion and adoption of 
the new Constitution. 
  Similarly, the leadership of the Republic pays much 
attention 
to the talks with the representatives of the opposition. The 
aim of these talks is to stabilize the political and economic 
situation and to ensure the peaceful life of all inhabitants of 
the country and to concentrate all the sound forces. 
  The head of the government expressed his satisfaction that 
the Russian Federation and neighboring Uzbekistan are rendering 
great assistance to the Republic as before. Today, we must 
decisively state that the fruitful work of every citizen of the 
Republic is important to resolve our problems. 
  The chairman of the Council of Ministers was asked numerous 
questions related to the various spheres of the life of the 
country, entry of the republic to the ruble zone, and the ways 
of settling reciprocal payments. The head of the government 
informed that the work is under way in this field. All the 
issues will be positively resolved in the coming months, and 
there should be no doubts about that, he stressed. It is a 
difficult task in Tajikistan to involve all the people able to 
work in useful social labor. It will be necessary to construct 
new plants for that. According to Abdujalil Samadov the most 
important task of the day is to provide the agriculture of the 
Republic with fuel and seeds, because the provision of the 
population with food depends on the solution of this problem. 
It was decided to use all the loans that will be given to 
Tajikistan by the Russian Federation [words indistinct] Samadov 
said. 
  Other economic and political issues were touched upon in the 
course of the new conference.

  [Text] Bishkek -- A draft interstate treaty on military 
service by Russian citizens in the Kyrgyz Armed Forces has been 
initialed at a meeting of representatives of the Russian and 
Kyrgyz Defense Ministries held in Bishkek. 
  The signed document will be valid until 31 December 1999. It 
stipulates that Russian servicemen may perform military service 
in the Kyrgyz Army on a contract basis, which means that they 
and their families will retain all the rights and privileges 
granted to Russian servicemen. On completion of service, the 
Kyrgyz Defense Ministry will obtain housing for each Russian 
serviceman (except in Moscow and St. Petersburg). If the 
Russian serviceman remains in Kyrgyzstan, however, the apartment 
he has been living in will be given to him free of charge. 
  In addition, the two countries' ministries reached agreement 
on the procedure for performance of military service by 
officers, warrant officers, servicewomen, and those on extended 
service. Until the end of 1994, they have the right to transfer 
without hindrance to the other state's Army.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>
  [Text] Yerevan March 16 TASS -- Armenia's opposition 
movement "National Self-determination" staged on Wednesday a 
rally in the capital Yerevan to demand that Russia denounce the 
1921 Moscow treaty concluded 73 years ago between Soviet Russia 
and Turkey. 
  "Democratic Russia should not be guided by the heritage of 
anti-popular bolshevik rule" -- this idea ran all through the 
rally which is to be continued outside the Russian Embassy in 
Yerevan. The rally organizers intend to present Russian 
Ambassador Vladimir Stupishin with a statement to be delivered 
to Russian authorities. The statement calls for cancellation of 
what they consider to be "an anti-Armenian treaty". 
  According to the newspaper ANKAKHUTYUN (INDEPENDENCE) 
published by the National Self-determination movement, since the 
collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991, Russia "has been 
abandoning, revising and dumping to the dung-heap of history 
international treaties immortalizing the crimes of bolshevik 
diplomacy". Among these crimes the newspaper cited the 1921 
Moscow treaty, which "re-adjusted" Armenia's boders and handed 
over part of its territory to Turkey. By denouncing this 
treaty, Russia would demonstrate its "new and just attitude 
towards the shameful past, as well as confirm its current 
political course in the transcaucasian region", the newspaper 
believes.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 16 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin's 
message entitled "On the Strengthening of the Russian State" to 
the Federal Assembly is to be considered by the State Duma on 
Wednesday. A draft resolution, endorsed by the council of the 
State Duma, is to be presented at a plenary session. 
  The parliamentarians, while sharing the main provisions of 
the presidential message, emphasise that the major task of the 
State Duma is to provide "legislative support for the 
development of an intergrated and stable democratic society" 
where the rights of the individual and citizen are respected, an 
effective economy functions, the principles of federal relations 
are consistently exercised, and the rights of nations and 
nationalities are assured". 
  Apart from considering a draft resolution, the Duma intends 
to review the enactment of its resolution "On a legal basis for 
elections to the state power bodies of the subjects of the 
Russian Federation and local self-government bodies and on the 
ensurance of the electoral rights of citizens." 
  The deputies are also expected to consider a bill "on a 
procedure for the provision of military and civilian personnel 
of the Russian federation for participation in peacekeeping 
operations or in the restoration of international peace and 
security and other types of peacemaking activities". 
  [Moscow ITAR-TASS in English at 0915 GMT on 16 March adds 
the 
following: "The State Duma has again failed to adopt a 
resolution concerning its stand with regard to President Boris 
Yeltsin's message `On the State of the Nation' after several 
days of discussion. 
  "In his message delivered at the end of February President 
Yeltsin called for a stronger Russian state."]

  [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) leader, 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, asked the U.S. "not to support those who 
had lost the parliamentary elections on December 12, that is to 
say Gaydar, Yavlinskiy, Shakhray and others who consider 
themselves democrats. This was announced by Zhirinovskiy after a 
meeting with former U.S. President Richard Nixon which lasted 
for about an hour and a half. 
  According to Zhirinovskiy, the former U.S. President "has 
the 
right understanding of the situation in the world and of our 
problems." 
  "The main point that I wanted to make known to U.S. 
President 
Bill Clinton is that he must not be afraid of me," Zhirinovskiy 
emphasized. He said Russia was moving towards a military regime 
and the danger stemmed from those who had lost the elections, 
from the so-called radical democrats. 
  Commenting on the chances of candidates running for 
presidential elections "which may take place earlier than within 
two years," Zhirinovskiy said his only real contender was former 
Russian vice president Aleksandr Rutskoy. According to the LDP 
leader, neither Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, nor Moscow Mayor 
Yuriy Luzhkov, neither Gaydar, Yavlinskiy and Shakhray, nor 
candidates from "the Communist, pro-communist or patriotic 
forces" could be his contenders. 
  Richard Nixon's advisor, Dmitri Simes, told the news 
conference that Zhirinovskiy had told Nixon that Yeltsin was 
"losing his influence." According to Symes, Nixon gave neither 
personal comments nor assessments during their conversation. 
  Asked whether Nixon changed his opinion of Zhirinovskiy 
after 
their meeting, Simes said that Nixon had been "informed that Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy could perform in different genres and in different 
situations. I am confident that the way Mr. Zhirinovskiy spoke 
today made due impression on President Nixon and he could place 
it in a certain context, since he knew both the speeches and 
political history of Mr. Zhirinovskiy." 
  Shortly after his meeting with Zhirinovskiy, Nixon received 
the leader of the Democratic Party of Russia faction in the 
State Duma, Nikolay Travkin. Their meeting lasted for 1 hour 20 
minutes. 
  In an interview with Interfax, Travkin said the conversation 
mainly focused on economic issues and prospects for equal 
partnership between Russia and the U.S. According to Travkin, 
he told Nixon that Russia would "not fall into coups and civil 
wars," because Russia had everything needed to avoid it. The 
only thing "lacking is political will, that of the president in 
the first place. You seem the only optimist here," concluded 
Nixon.

  [Text] Moscow March 15 TASS -- Former U.S. President 
Richard Nixon met Tuesday with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of 
the Russian nationalist "Liberal Democratic" party. 
  The meeting was held behind closed doors. 
  The press service of Zhirinovskiy's party told ITAR-TASS 
that 
the two politicians focused on Russian-American relations 
"taking into consideration the geopolitical interests of the two 
countries", and on inter-parliamentary contacts. 
  Zhirinovskiy handed to Nixon a personal message addressed to 
President Bill Clinton, the press service said. 
  According to press reports, Nixon wanted to meet 
Zhirinovskiy 
during his week-long visit to Moscow to get a clearer idea of 
the broad spectrum of Russian political leaders capable of 
influencing developments in the country. 
  Zhirinovskiy, however, denied last week that he wanted to 
meet the American ex-president.

  [Text] In Vladivostok on Monday Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher agreed that Russian 
experts would take part in drafting the project of a new COCOM. 
  A high-ranking Russian diplomat close to Kozyrev told 
INTERFAX that this was an extremely important aspect of 
Russian-American cooperation for the nonproliferation of 
missiles and other dangerous know-how. 
  "Suffice it to recall the incident involving the export of 
Russian cryogenic boosters to India and the restrictive moves of 
the West in relation to Russia, to understand how important this 
question is. The American side has understood at last that the 
nonproliferation of dangerous know-how is our common concern and 
treats Russia with more trust now," he said. 
  The fact that Russian experts will be involved in drafting 
the concept of a new COCOM from the very start is particularly 
important, he went on to say. They will not have to wait for 
what America will prepare for them, he added.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Kozlov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 16 March -- A draft convention guaranteeing 
the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, 
linguistic, and religious minorities will be completed "in the 
very shortest time." An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told by a 
high-ranking official in the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry 
that an understanding to this effect was reached at a sitting of 
the CIS Council of Foreign Ministers, which ended here today. 
It was attended by the heads of the Foreign Ministries of 
Russia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan, and by 
ambassadors and deputy ministers from seven other Commonwealth 
countries. 
  According to the Russian diplomat, the leaders of the 
foreign 
policy departments considered "a huge agenda." The sittings of 
the Council passed off "on the whole in a constructive spirit," 
and the discussions enabled a step forward to be taken in the 
discussion of important issues, although final decisions on many 
of them have yet to be taken. 
  Thus, experts have been instructed to put the finishing 
touches to a draft declaration on observance of the sovereignty, 
territorial integrity, and inviolability of the borders of the 
Commonwealth states. 
  The high-ranking diplomat described a group of problems 
connected with the sharing out of non-military marine vessels of 
the former USSR with the states of the CIS and the Baltic area 
as "a difficult question" that "will be looked at again." Those 
attending the sitting confined themselves to deciding to set up 
a group of experts. 
  Cognizance was taken of a paper from the Council of Border 
Troop Commanders about the progress of the talks between the 
Russian Federation, Central Asian, and Transcaucasian states on 
cooperation on guarding the borders with third countries. Those 
attending the forum decided to uphold the idea of creating 
within the CIS a permanent consultative commission for 
peacekeeping activities. 
  The sitting also discussed matters connected with NATO's 
"Partnership for Peace" program. Permanent consultations 
between the Foreign Ministries on the participation of the CIS 
states in implementing it will now come into being. The 
prospects for CIS-CSCE cooperation were examined. 
  A proposal put forward by Kazakhstan to hold a special 
session of the UN General Assembly on problems of the 
post-confrontation period "was, on the whole, supported". It 
was decided, however, to continue the discussion. 
  Russia, Belarus, and the Ukraine were instructed to prepare 
the text of a joint message from the CIS countries to the 
peoples of the Commonwealth and the world community in 
connection with the 50th anniversary of victory in the Great 
Patriotic War. 
  The timing of the next sitting of the Foreign Ministers' 
Council was determined. It will take place in June on the eve 
of the next Council of Heads of State. 
  A joint sitting of the CIS Council of Foreign Ministers and 
the Council of Defense Ministers of the states participating in 
the Treaty on Collective Security was held in the afternoon. It 
considered a package of documents regulating the activities of 
the Collective Security Council and its secretariat, which were 
set up in December last year. Further work on these documents 
is required before they are submitted at the next sitting of the 
Council of Heads of State. They must be adopted in order to set 
in motion the mechanism that has been created. 
  Another question that the Foreign and Defense Ministers 
examined concerned a protocol to the Treaty on Collective 
Security. The point is that two countries, Russia and 
Azerbaijan, have proposed amendments to the document. In the 
course of discussion, the ministers concluded that it was not a 
good idea to modify the actual text of the treaty, but that the 
changes that life prompted could be expressed in a declaration. 
A decision to draw up such a declaration was adopted. 
  Consideration was given to a number of possible measures to 
boost the effectiveness of the functioning of the collective 
peacekeeping forces in the Republic of Tajikistan and to 
stabilize the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border.

  [Text] The CIS Council of Foreign Ministers and Council of 
Defense Ministers have convened in Moscow. Meanwhile, a 
delegation from Azerbaijan has arrived in that capital. Foreign 
Minister Gasan Gasanov and Defense Minister Mamedrafi Mamedov 
are among the members of the republic's delegation. 
  The Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs Press Center told 
a Baku Radio correspondent that the CIS Council of Foreign 
Ministers is expected to deliberate on 11 matters related to the 
convention on the rights of national minorities, the agreement 
on collective security, territorial integrity of the CIS 
countries, mutual relations between the CIS and the CSCE, 
consultations among the CIS countries on the realization of the 
program for cooperation for peace, and other issues. 
  The republic's delegation intends to try to have the 
proposals Azerbaijan submitted during the CIS heads of state 
summit on collective security in Ashgabat on 24 December 
included in the agreement on collective security. Azerbaijan is 
convinced that the agreement's provisions must not only apply to 
foreign aggression against the CIS countries, but they must also 
apply to internal attacks. 
  The delegation plans to submit another document to the CIS 
Council of Foreign Ministers for approval by the CIS leaders. 
That is a draft declaration of respect for CIS members' 
sovereignty and territorial integrity and respect for the 
inviolability of their borders. The declaration notes that the 
principle of noninterference in each other's internal affairs 
must be the essence of friendly relations and cooperation among 
the CIS countries.

  [Text] A regular session of the CIS Council of Foreign 
Ministers in Moscow on Wednesday [16 March] reached unanimity on 
key foreign policy matters related both to the Commonwealth and 
international affairs. The CIS is actually assuming a new 
quality, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stated after the 
session. 
  He said the ministers discussed the protection of the 
external borders of the CIS. According to Kozyrev, the 
discussion took place in a businesslike and constructive 
atmosphere which left Russia satisfied. 
  In his opinion the adoption of a decision on the formation 
of 
a consultative commission for the peaceful settlement of 
differences within the CIS is an important step taking the 
Commonwealth forward. 
  The convention on the protection of ethnic minorities was a 
more complicated matter, he said. "On the one hand, some 
countries are not sending their experts to working groups. As a 
result, their ministers find themselves in a difficult situation 
because are not in the know. On the other, this is an 
indication of the lack of readiness of several countries to 
discuss this complex and delicate matter," Kozyrev said. 
  He said there are problems in this respect with Azerbaijan, 
Uzbekistan and Ukraine. 
  In Kozyrev's opinion, one should not attach political 
meaning 
to the fact that some countries were represented by ambassadors 
and other officials, instead of ministers at the Wednesday 
session. "After all anyone can fall ill or have important 
domestic matters to resolve. The absence of several ministers 
does not mean that they were not interested in the meeting," 
Kozyrev said. 
  Only Russia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia 
were represented at the meeting by foreign ministers. Ukraine 
was represented by its ambassador in Moscow Vladimir 
Krzhanitskiy, Belarus by Deputy Foreign Minister Petr Belyayev, 
Kyrgyzstan by the Acting Foreign Minister Alibek Jekshenkulov, 
Armenia by Deputy Foreign Minister Armen Kirakosian, Moldova by 
Deputy Foreign Minister Ion Cebuk, Turkmenistan by Vice Premier 
Boris Shikhmuradov, Uzbekistan by the ambassador in Russia Yusuf 
Abdullayev. 
  The meeting was also attended by Executive CIS Secretary 
Ivan 
Korotchenya and the Chief of Staff for Coordinating Military 
Cooperation Colonel-General Victor Samsonov. 
  After the session the foreign ministers were joined by the 
defence ministers of the CIS countries that signed the 
collective security treaty. 
  They are expected to make a joint statement after the 
meeting.

  [Text] "Military commanders of any rank are not empowered 
to resolve the Black Sea Fleet issue," Admiral Eduard Baltin, 
the fleet commander, told Interfax. He emphasized that the 
matter was up to the Russian and Ukrainian presidents to decide. 
  Baltin said so in response to the last week's remarks made 
by 
Vladimir Beskorovainiy, commander of the Ukrainian Navy, who 
said that "Ukraine no longer raises the possibility of 
transferring Black Sea Fleet ships to Russia as payment for 
debts accrued from oil and gas supplies." Beskorovainiy 
believed that the document signed in Massandra was a protocol of 
intent, not an agreement. "The fleet has to be split half and 
half before the end of 1995," Beskorovainiy emphasized. 
  Admiral Igor Kasatonov, first deputy commander-in-chief of 
the Russian Navy, commented on Beskorovainiy's remarks by saying 
that the Massandra document "might be a protocol of intent, but 
it was signed by the presidents." 
  "If these remarks had been made by Kravchuk, this would make 
all the difference," Kasatonov said. 
  As he put it, "a political decision was made which 
recognized 
the interests of the world community as well as Russia. The 
world views Russia as a reliable and strong partner who is 
acting for peace, calm and stabilization." 
  The presidents of Ukraine and Russia Leonid Kravchuk and 
Boris Yeltsin signed an agreement in Mukholatka, near Yalta, 
whereby the Black Sea Fleet was to be the core of the Russian 
and Ukrainian navies. Until the two navies are formed the fleet 
was to be jointly commanded by the two presidents. 
  The presidents signed another agreement in Moscow on June 
17, 
1993, on dividing the fleet half and half. 
  Under their latest agreement signed in Massandra, southern 
Crimea, on September 3, 1993 Ukraine was to transfer its part of 
the Black Sea Fleet to Russia as payment for supplies of Russian 
fuel. The specifics of the compensation mechanism and the use of 
naval bases in the Crimea was to be agreed on later through 
negotiations. The procedure of evaluating the fleet's assets was 
to be negotiated within a month, but the talks became deadlocked.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 17 (ITAR-TASS) -- The NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA newspaper reports today that a regular meeting of the 
foreign ministers' council of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States (CIS) held in Moscow on Wednesday agreed the most 
important foreign policy issues on the life of the Commonwealth 
and its participation in international affairs. 
  Arguing with advocates of a state of economic emergency in 
Russia, Professor Aleksandr Livshits, head of the Russian 
president's expert group, writes in the TRUD newspaper that 'the 
country needs, among other things, an appropriate law to impose 
a state of economic emergency in the country. 
  'The law would lay down under what conditions the state of 
emergency is imposed, for what period, what measures are being 
enacted and who takes the decision.' Livshits pointed out the 
absence of such a law at present. 
  Therefore, he claims, 'the imposition of a state of economic 
emergency in our country is out of the question.' Noting that 
the Russian parliament should decide what laws should be drafted 
and adopted, the expert stressed the priority need for creating 
a legal basis for reforms. 
  Livshits expressed opinion that 'talks about emergency 
measures are groundless and even undesirable, since they can 
promote destabilization in society.' Describing the present 
situation in the Russian economy as 'difficult', the expert 
stressed that 'the government should keep the situation under 
control, implement the present programs thoughtfully, including 
work on structural reorganization. 
  'On the other hand, a return to administrative mechanisms of 
government and a freeze on prices and wages would lead the 
country to a quick collapse'. 
  Commenting on the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan, 
Nikolay Medvedev, head of the president's office division on 
work with territories, says in an interview with NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA that the treaty is really a qualitatively new basid 
document recording both the delimitation of subjects of 
authority as well as mutual delegation of powers between the 
federation and its member republic. 
  He expressed opinion that the treaty with Tatarstan 'will be 
both a stabilising factor and work done for the country's 
future.' 'We have shown an ability to find the way out of 
really deadlocked situations and what's the main thing -- a 
desire to come to agreement,' Medvedev stressed. 
  In the opinion of the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper, ' the 
countryside should not be fenced off with a bureaucratic wall 
from the market. At the same time, peasants should not be 
herded, in 'the bright past'. 
  The newspaper expresses regret in a report from a meeting of 
the government commission on urgent matters that the favorable 
period for the state's timely aid to the countryside has passed. 
  'The state in the person of the finance ministry has turned 
to be unable to return debts in time,' ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI writes, 
noting that the state now owes 1,300 billion rubles to the 
countryside 'for already consumed produce.' 
  Writing in the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper, Margarita 
Maximova, 
senior researcher of the institute of world economics and 
international relations, claims that only economically strong 
and politically stable Russia can become a driving force for the 
integration of former Soviet republics. 
  Examining versions for cooperation within the Commonwealth, 
the scholar draws the conclusion that discrepancy between the 
interests of Russia and other CIS countries is no barrier to the 
rapprochement. 
  'World experience shows that any interstate alliance was and 
is based, above all, on the balance on interests of its 
participants,' Maximova stresses. 
  Reporting the publication of the book 'The Last Soviet 
Government', the PRAVDA newspaper writes that 'the last the 
ministers of the Soviet Union are convinced that they stepped 
down unvanquished and unhumiliated'. 
  The newspaper features opinions of nine former ministers 
Nikolay Ryzhkov, Leonid Abalkin, Vadim Bakatin and others on 
events in Russia. 
  Under the headline 'Interview with a woman called Soviet 
Jeanne d'Arc', PRAVDA outlines views of former Soviet legislator 
Sazhi Umalatova on the situaion in Russia. 'The people will 
learn to protect their rights later of sooner,' she stresses. 
  Expressing joy over the recent release of inmates for the 
Lefortovo and Matrosskaya Tishina prisons as a result of the 
amnesty proclaimed by parliament, Umalatova stated that 
'Hysteria concerning unpredictable consequences to be caused by 
the amnesty of opposition politicians is not accidental.' 
  'The same 'scenario writers' stir up trouble, trying to 
split 
society and to provoke opposition for drastic actions in order 
to bring tanks back,' she claims. 
  Under the title 'In the Footsteps of Terminator', the 
SOVETYSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper describes particulars of a 
massacre at a Russian border post on Tanfilev Island (Russian 
Far East), including a commentary by Colonel-General Nikolayev, 
commander-in-chief of Russian Border troops, on this deplorable 
event.

  [Text] Moscow March 17 TASS -- Relations between the 
United States and Russia are the factor determining the degree 
of security in the whole world. This is why so much importance 
is being attached to contacts between the leaders of their 
defence authorities. This was the key idea behind today's 
meeting in Moscow between Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev 
and U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry. 
  A personal relationship between the two countries' defence 
ministers is no less important and need further deepening, the 
meeting was told. 
  Following talks between the two delegations, William Perry 
and Pavel Grachev are due to hold a one-to-one conversation. 
The Russian minister told journalists he wanted to discuss with 
his opposite number from the United States the situation in 
Bosnia, Russia's participation in the Partnership for Peace 
programme, joint peacekeeping, the problem of nuclear arms, 
including their withdrawal from Ukraine and a wide range of 
problems relating to better relations between the military 
authorities of the two countries. 
  Also today, William Perry is due to meet First Russian 
Deputy 
Defence Minister Andrey Kokoshin and Chief of Staff Mikhail 
Kolesnikov. 
  According to American sources, Perry, 66, is a true 
professional with deep knowledge and extensive experience. He 
favors the development of the Stealth bombers, Cruise missiles 
and high- precision electronic-optical homing devices.

<F P=106> ["Commentary on Yesterday's Report" by Major General </F>
(Retired) Viktor Chudov: "Our Strategists Are Too 
Unsophisticated"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg -- There have been reports in the 
mass media that a joint military exercise is to be held on 
Russian territory with the U.S. Armed Forces, involving a 
Russian motorized rifle division and a U.S. infantry division. 
The purpose of the exercise has not been given. 
  Yesterday PRAVDA informed readers that Brigade General 
Leonard Holder Jr., commander of the U.S. Army's 3d Infantry 
Division, had already visited Orenburg. He was involved in 
preparing for the tactical exercises which it turns out are to 
be held this summer. 
  Here just a few ideas for starters. Orenburg Oblast has been 
announced as the scene of the exercise. The military are aware 
that the Totskiy test range, where the now-famous exercise 
involving the detonation of an aerial nuclear bomb took place 40 
years ago, is the only place in Orenburg Oblast where such an 
exercise can be held in the summer until the harvest has been 
brought in. In terms of training the Totskiy test range is not 
the most convenient for this kind of exercise. But it is the 
closest of Russia's test ranges to the Central Asian republics. 
  It is also well-known that a sizeable Strategic Rocket 
Forces 
grouping is stationed in Orenburg Oblast and a top headquarters 
is stationed in the oblast center. There are also other 
installations of military and economic importance in the 
southern Urals that are of interest to certain foreign states' 
services. 
  The U.S. infantry division comprises 18,000 personnel, 54 M1 
tanks, 200 guns and mortars, nine multiple launchers, 410 
antitank guided missiles, 133 armored personnel carriers and 
infantry fighting vehicles, 218 helicopters, several thousand 
vehicles of various categories and purposes, antiaircraft, 
engineering, communications, and other combat and auxiliary 
hardware. What is more, the division will be accompanied by a 
certain number of interpreters, various advisers, and various 
support personnel.... 
  This all has to be accommodated, housed, provided with food, 
fuel and lubricants, and other items and pieces of military gear 
in accordance with U.S. standards. 
  A corresponding quantity of supplies will also come with the 
division. The Americans do not even pay a social call without 
bringing in supplies. And this is no social call.... 
  Plenty of aircraft -- U.S. aircraft, of course -- will be 
required to deliver and subsequently provide these forces and 
facilities with backup and it will be based at Russian 
airfields. Thus, there will be a foreign combined military 
formation and a foreign air base with vague rights and duties on 
Russian territory, creating a situation with no normative-legal 
base. 
  The scenario and plan for any exercise are formulated on the 
basis of the exercise's clearly defined objective. What might 
be the purpose of the scheduled exercise, and why is it not 
being given? 
  For Russia the purpose of this kind of exercise is to 
rehearse cooperation between the two states' combined formations 
in combat operations against an adversary that one state's armed 
forces cannot handle alone, in order either to carry out or to 
rebuff aggression. 
  First, Russia has no aggressive intent against any neighbors 
near or far, as the country's supreme military-political 
leadership has repeatedly stated. 
  Second, there are no aggressors in the immediate vicinity 
of Russia that Russia's Armed Forces could not rebuff 
autonomously. Apart from military alliances like NATO, of which 
the U.S. Armed Forces form the basis. 
  A spontaneous exercise to rehearse cooperation between the 
armed forces of two states that recently opposed one another is 
pointless. So say military theory and military practice. Thus, 
for instance, command and control of combat operations includes 
the processing and analysis of very varied battle management, 
support, and other information. But how is information from 
sources that have a totally different informational-linguistic 
and concept base and uncoordinated means of conveying 
information to be processed and analyzed? Here is how a Russian 
specialist describes U.S. Army combat documents: "Combat orders 
in the U.S. Army are characterized by their own unique features. 
They are formulated in accordance with a definite, unified, 
rigorously prescribed format, which is regulated by 
corresponding instructions and impossible to understand if you 
do not possess a sound knowledge of them." 
  The Persian Gulf, for instance, effectively saw operations 
by 
a single military bloc, within which information flow was 
formalized and coordinated along with the concept and the 
informational-linguistic base, means of conveying information 
were coordinated, and conferences, seminars, and dozens of 
exercises of various kinds and levels are held every year. But 
even there, notwithstanding the pace of combat operations today 
and the flow of information, linguistic and other barriers have 
arisen in the way of information and it has not proved possible 
to overcome these barriers rapidly. We know that the Americans 
had to deliver 10,000 personal computers and the appropriate 
software to the combat operation zone in order to automate the 
process of overcoming these barriers. Nevertheless it did not 
prove possible to overcome all the barriers and the commander of 
the multinational forces was forced during both defensive and 
offensive operations to give all national forces their own area 
of combat operations.... 
  However, there is a certain hypothetical situation in which 
Russian and U.S. divisions will be able to operate together 
without prior preparation. Namely a civil war situation. Is 
the country's supreme political leadership not preparing for 
that situation by inviting along foreign divisions? 
  What is the U.S. military-political leadership's objective 
in 
carrying out this exercise? 
  Throughout the 20th century the United States has tried to 
gain a footing for its armed forces on the continent of Asia. A 
tremendous amount of money has been spent and plenty of blood 
has been shed, U.S. blood included, but it has only succeeded in 
getting hold of a small piece of the Korean Peninsula. That is 
why the U.S. side sees it as one of the most important aims of 
the scheduled exercise to introduce its armed contingent onto 
Russian soil and open up a new theater of combat operations. 
The U.S. "Partnership for Peace" concept is for naive fools, a 
cover for another U.S. concept -- "Peace U.S.-Style" -- and the 
strategy of world domination. 
  The aim is no simple one and includes a whole series, a 
lengthy set of tasks that would take a long time to list. 
Although I should do so to enlighten Russian citizens who have 
lost interest in military problems over the last 50 years of 
peace. 
  Some of the details of the coming exercise cause suspicion 
and doubts among military people who are able to assess events 
critically and competently: Is this the main aim being pursued 
by the Americans, who are stage-managing events in Russia? 
  Remember late 1992. A trend toward consolidation developed 
in the CIS republics, among not only peoples but also 
governments and presidents. Preparations were made for a 
summit-level conference and a package of important documents was 
made ready for signing. 
  Then all of a sudden a U.S. President who had had his day 
and 
was effectively an ex-president challenged the Russian president 
to sign the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Arms Reduction -- a 
treaty that was still half-baked and in need of considerable 
finalization. And our president obediently rushed in, without 
squaring his actions with his CIS colleagues or the Russian 
Supreme Soviet. He rushed in and signed the treaty, creating a 
host of military, economic, and political problems and dealing 
an arrogant blow to the ambitions of his fellow presidents and 
legislators. The conference did of course go ahead, but the 
atmosphere was different and no one has implemented the 
documents that were signed. I could go on giving examples of 
interference by U.S. stage managers. 
  A similar situation is developing once again. A wave of 
unification sentiments has once again arisen among the peoples 
of the former USSR republics. 
  Do U.S. strategists want that? No! How can it be stopped? 
How can they cause chaos? How can separatists and nationalists 
be revived and inspired to vigorous activity? 
  It is hard to think of a better means than an exercise in 
the 
south of Asian Russia. And if it involves U.S. troops and is 
accompanied by certain propaganda details, the reporting of the 
exercise as well as the actual fact that it is taking place 
could prove extremely heartening for anti-Russian forces. 
  Russia does not need the planned exercise, and the presence 
on Russian territory of any foreign military contingents is 
unnecessary and harmful. World practice has seen examples of a 
foreign military legion being stationed on the territory of 
prostrate and weak states. No one has ever conquered Russia, 
and it was not and will not be weak. The Americans do not have 
to teach the Russians how to fight. 
  It is high time that the Russian military department 
conducted its own military exercise -- a strategic war game to 
repel aggression by a coalition of nuclear powers, to repel a 
massive nuclear attack. And all officials whose functional duty 
is to take charge of repelling aggression should be involved in 
the exercise. That kind of game could establish what the Russian 
Armed Forces and their leadership are capable of. 
  Back in the days of the Union the Russian [as published] 
General Staff was so assiduous and spent so long persuading the 
Armed Forces, the military public, and military science of the 
primacy of politics over strategy that it lost its role and 
niche in the system of state governance and turned military 
science into the servant of political libertarianism. The 
result was that fundamental natural sciences -- mathematics, 
physics, cybernetics, etc -- were not called for in resolving 
military-strategic problems. That is why the present 
spontaneous attempts to set up research directorates and centers 
under and within the General Staff in imitation of the foremost 
capitalist states are rather reminiscent of the efforts of the 
monkey in I.A. Krylov's fable who tried to improve his 
age-impaired vision. That is why it is at the very least naive 
to rely on the General Staff and military science to conduct an 
exhaustive and systematic analysis of Russia's geostrategic 
position. The only feasible option in the current situation is 
a real-life war game [naturnoye modelirovaniye igri], staff and 
command-staff exercises -- unilateral, bilateral, and trilateral 
-- extensively involving staffs and outlining the actions to be 
taken by troops from all categories of the Russian Armed Forces. 
  Were the Russian Defense Ministry to organize and carry out 
that kind of game, it would help clear up many problems of the 
Russian state's security. 
  But the Russian Defense Ministry's refusal to carry out this 
kind of game is also a result which clarifies the stance 
espoused by the top brass.

<F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report: "A Partnership That Is Always at </F>
Hand"] 
  [Text] Russia and America are friends and partners once 
again: The meeting in Vladivostok between Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher was officially described as "fully satisfactory." 
Scandals over Aldrich Ames and Richard Nixon appear to have 
been left behind. Even the latest effort of the aging former 
U.S. president -- his presence at the "Working Russia" rally on 
Sunday, where Nixon reportedly signed his name on a leaflet 
calling on citizens to take part in a rally on 17 March "to 
campaign for the restoration of the USSR" -- has not changed 
anything. 
  A certain stabilization in Russian-American relations nearly 
to the former -- pre-crisis -- level, however, could have been 
confidently forecast two weeks ago when an anti-Russian campaign 
was in full swing in the American press and in Congress. At the 
time, a "high-ranking official" in charge of foreign policy 
matters in the Clinton administration was in Moscow on an 
official visit; naturally, she asked not to be identified should 
she be quoted. I asked her: "Why did Bill Clinton personally 
announce the arrest of the Ames couple? Do so extraordinary 
actions by the top official signify the beginning of drastic 
changes in relations with Moscow?" 
  The answer was: "No, they do not, on the contrary. It is 
because the administration is doing its utmost to keep the 
relations of partnership with Moscow that the President has 
spearheaded that campaign, so that it can be quickly and 
painlessly 'hushed up' afterward. Had he not done so, economic 
sanctions against Moscow would have already been imposed." (Any 
Russian bureaucrat or politician would confirm that the best way 
to "kill" a damaging initiative is to head it.) The Ames case, 
indeed, has come to nothing surprisingly fast; even the 
deportation of James Morris, CIA station chief, from Moscow has 
not drawn any coherent response. 
  The issue is not only that Bill Clinton has invested too 
much 
personal effort in establishing a friendly relationship with 
Yeltsin and does not want to be seen a bungler. The 
Russian-American partnership has a more than real foundation. 
Both parties in the Congress and the administration agree that 
no return to a global nuclear standoff should be allowed. This 
is what U.S. Defense Secretary Bill Perry said this week on the 
eve of his visit to Moscow. 
  The Americans appear to be ready to go to any length to 
prevent this prospect from materializing. Hence, there is an 
entirely realistic alternative to the current soft, pro-Moscow 
stance by the Washington administration. This is a policy of 
sanctions, ultimatums, and growing pressure. 
  In Vladivostok, Andrey Kozyrev said that Russia would not 
accept the role of "a junior partner" and that it demands 
equality in relations with the United States. But equality is 
something we cannot even dream about given current realities. A 
Russia stricken by permanent political and economic crises does 
not have realistic possibilities at this stage to pursue a 
stable, active foreign policy in the Balkans or the Middle East. 
The Russian Foreign Ministry, however, has been displaying the 
most intense activity possible, thus successfully creating the 
legend about a series of "stunning foreign policy successes." 
  As a result, the image of a strong and increasingly 
powerful, 
imperialistic Russia is gaining ground overseas, a Russia that 
is just ripe to start being "contained." The incompetence of 
American politicians and political scientists about the actual 
situation in Russia, apparently, can only be matched by the 
incompetence of their Russian counterparts. The stabilization 
in bilateral relations may prove short-lived, and the 
circumstances and results of Nixon's Moscow visit may turn out 
to be nothing but harbingers of further events.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Richard Nixon: There Is No Alternative </F>
To Yeltsin Today"] 
  [Text] There is no alternative to President Boris Yeltsin 
in Russia right now. This was stated to journalists by Richard 
Nixon after his speech at the State Duma committee for 
international affairs. "I held meetings with a number of 
leaders and concluded that right now there is no one who would 
be ready to take his place," the U.S. ex-president stressed. 
"They will appear but for the moment there are no people like 
that," ITAR-TASS reports. 
  Speaking of his meetings with Grigoriy Yavlinskiy and Sergey 
Shakhray, Richard Nixon noted: "They are both young, vigorous, 
and highly educated. I think they can be viewed as potential 
leaders. But I would not rule out others with whom I met. In 
particular I was impressed by the Communists' leader Gennadiy 
Zyuganov. But he will not become president since Russia does 
not intend to return to communism."

  [Text] Paris March 16 TASS -- Russian chief of General 
Staff Colonel-General Mikhail Kolesnikov ended his visit to 
France with a lecture, "Defence Policy and Reorganisation of the 
Russian Armed Forces," at the French military school on 
Wednesday [16 March]. 
  Kolesnikov toured the school located in the French capital 
and had a one-to-one meeting with his French counterpart Jacques 
Lanxade. 
  During his three-day visit, Kolesnikov met with French 
military leaders to discuss French military policy in light of 
the white paper recently issued by the government, France's 
participation in U.N. peace-keeping operations, its relations 
with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, NATO, 
the Western European Union and Russian-French bilateral 
relations.

  [Text] Tokyo March 17 TASS -- Tokyo believes that Russia's 
official membership of the Group of Seven industrialised 
countries (G-7) should be decided gradually and "naturally" in 
line with the accumulation of positive results of dialogues 
between the leading industrial countries and Russia. 
  This was announced at a meeting between Japan's Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is also deputy prime minister, with 
Russian journalists ahead of his visit to Moscow on March 19. 
  Hata said Italy, which is president of the G-7 meetings this 
year, will decide on inviting Russian President Boris Yeltsin to 
the G-7 summit in Naples and on the form of his participation in 
it. 
  The earlier tested scheme "seven plus one," in accordance 
with which the Russian president has already participated in G-7 
annual meeting, is quite suitable for discussing frankly and 
openly political and economic issues of concern to all, he added. 
  "I consider the fact of Russia's regular participation in 
G-7 
meetings as important," Hata pointed out and stressed that a 
change to the current formula would depend on the results of 
dialogue between Moscow and the leading industrial powers of the 
world.

  [Text] Belgrade, 16 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- Vitaliy Churkin met 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic today. The official report 
about the meeting says the two exchanged views on the talks 
process, Russia's initiatives, and the conditions for achieving 
a political settlement in the former Yugoslavia. It was 
stressed that one of the main conditions is that equal account 
be taken of the national and state interests of the sides drawn 
into the conflict and that mediation by international 
representatives be impartial. 
  Churkin also met Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. The 
sides described the meeting as "a continuation of working 
contacts with a high level of mutual understanding." Karadzic 
expressed his satisfaction with the fact that when the issue of 
a Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia was being discussed, the 
Russian side had made it quite clear that the Bosnian Serbs have 
the same sovereign rights as the Muslims and Croats. For the 
Bosnian Serbs, close relations with Yugoslavia are crucial, so 
we have to look for a way towards a settlement that takes 
account of this interest, Karadzic said. 
  Churkin left Belgrade today. He said he was going to 
Washington to hold consultations about the Yugoslav problem with 
the U.S. President's special representative Charles Redman.

  [Text] Moscow, 16 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- Iraqi President Saddam 
Husayn has been officially invited to attend the congress of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], which opens on 2 
April in Moscow. This has been confirmed by LDPR leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in response to an inquiry from a 
correspondent for the journal EKHO PLANETY [ECHO OF THE PLANET]. 
"We have invited anybody with whom we maintain relations -- 
people from Iraq, Serbia, North Korea, South Korea, and other 
countries. We have friends everywhere," he said. 
  The sensational news that the president of Taiwan had also 
been invited to the congress and might turn up has not so far 
been confirmed. 
  However, it has been reported from Paris that the first 
deputy leader of the French National Front will definitely come 
to Moscow for the LDPR congress. The head of the extreme 
right-wing German People's Union, Gerhard Frey, also intends to 
take part in it.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Vodeau in Moscow] </F>
  [Text] In an interview with THE BALTIC OBSERVER in Moscow 
March 5, out-spoken Russian nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
said that "my people and supporters are safeguarding the 
interests of Russians wherever they live, including the Baltic 
states." 
  He added that his views, which many regard as harsh if not 
insane, are a defensive reaction to the assault on Slavic 
nations from the Baltics to the Balkans and beyond. 
  "The present government," said Zhirinovskiy with a wave of 
this hand "has betrayed the nation and doomed it to extinction. 
This is real genocide. Look at Bosnia. Nobody but us 
prevented Sarajevo from being bombed by the allied NATO forces. 
I made it quite clear that the NATO attack on Sarajevo would 
mean an outbreak of war with Russia, and the generals over in 
the West figured it out." 
  In Zhirinovskiy's view, NATO is trying to isolate Russia by 
inviting the Baltic countries and other Eastern European nations 
to join the Partnership for Peace program, and by surrounding 
Russia and the Serbs with enemies. 
  "NATO plans to completely isolate Russia and Bosnia. In 
Bosnia, part of its population is to be converted to 
Catholicism, while the rest are to become Muslims. 
  "Now look, Russia is surrounded by Islamic countries in the 
south from the Balkans to Turkey and Central Asia. In China, 
there are 1.2 billion Chinese, in the West, Germans and Balts. 
  "In fifty years, there won't be any Russians left, except in 
Moscow, Vologda, and Arkhangel'sk in the north. The last 10 to 
15 million Russians would kick the bucket there," Zhirinovskiy 
said. 
  He added that these strikes against Russia and the Bosnian 
Serbs showed that "the Third World War is on, but in the West 
they're afraid of Russia's powerful arsenals, so they destroy us 
economically." 
  He bemoaned the passing of great Russia, saying that "once 
Russia was proud of its ballet, space explorers, science, and 
powerful army, but no more." 
  Another problem confronting Russia, in Zhirinovskiy's view, 
is the influx of refugees from other countries. 
  "We must stop this wave of refugees, except for Russians. 
Many of them are fleeing oppression in the Baltic and Asian 
states 
  "A ban should be introduced for traders and profiteers, they 
mustn't be let in our towns and villages. And send away all 
foreign students," Zhirinovskiy said. 
  All foreigners, he said, have to have visas. 
  As for his future plans, Zhirinovskiy told THE BALTIC 
OBSERVER that he has his eye on Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's job. He believes that the presidential elections will 
take place long before June 12, 1996, and that "if we elect the 
wrong leader again, and take the wrong path, it would be 
unpardonable." 
  On a final note, Zhirinovskiy said "for three months now, 
they have been calling me a Russian Hitler. Can you imagine? 
All these years, my people and I have been honest and sincere."

<F P=106> [Interview with Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir </F>
Zhirinovskiy by Moscow correspondent Dmitriy Prokofiev outside 
the Russian parliament; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Prokofiev] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, you say that you 
will be the next president of Russia, but recent polls give you 
only 6 percent of the vote. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] The polls are rubbish. Before the elections 
they said Zhirinovskiy would hardly make the minimum required 
quota, but I won. The press publishes those polls because it is 
paid to do so. It is paid to do me in. However, nobody will do 
me in, and I will destroy them all. 
  [Prokofiev] Who is paying and who wants to destroy you? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] The mafia wants to do me in, because I will 
exterminate it the day after the elections, when I become 
president of the state. As soon as I enter the Kremlin, I will 
issue a decree to exterminate organized crime. 
  Ten thousand gang leaders will be arrested and executed in 
public ceremonies. That is what I will do to them. So, the 
mafia is afraid and is paying for this character assassination. 
  And you, the journalists, publish it. You are turncoats. 
You are constantly inciting. And then you are surprised when a 
journalist disappears here and another is murdered there. If 
you go on inciting and slandering, everybody will start killing 
you off. 
  [Prokofiev] Are you sure you will become the next president 
of the state in spite of what you call the incitement and 
slander against you? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] No doubt about it. There are no other 
candidates. If elections are held this year, I will get 55 
percent of the vote in the first round. If the elections are 
held in two years, then all the better. By then I will be 50, 
the voters will give me a present, and I will probably get 70 
percent. 
  There are no other candidates. There simply are not. All 
the politicians who are identified with the government do not 
stand a chance because they are responsible for the poverty, 
inflation, and organized crime. A genocide, that is what is 
happening here. Sexual deviation and death throes. 
  The health minister says there are fewer abortions now. Sure 
there are less. After all, almost all the women who can still 
have abortions have already emigrated from Russia. That is what 
the current regime has done. 
  And, there is nobody in the opposition who the people know 
as 
well as they know me. When I visit the Russian countryside, 
people kiss my hands. They truly overwhelm me with their 
kissing. 
  They know I am the only one here protecting the rights of 
the 
Russian people. Nobody believes the libel you spread about me, 
such as that I am a fascist, a Jew hater, and whatnot. 
  The name of my party is the Liberal Democratic Party. So, I 
am a liberal and a democrat, and cannot be either a fascist or 
an anti- Semite. [passage omitted] 
  [Prokofiev] So, you do not have any problems with the Jews? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] There are no problems. I am neither an anti- 
Semite nor a Zionist. That does not interest me at all. Many 
Jewish journalists claim that I am anti-Semite, but that is only 
because the mafia pays them off. Other journalists claim that I 
am a Zionist, and they are also paid by the underworld. 
  [Prokofiev] You also said that the CIA pays. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Sure, the CIA pays. The Americans do not 
want Russia to have a strong and intelligent leader who will 
take care of national interests. But they will fail. Everybody 
will fail, I will be the next president, and Russia will triumph.

  [Text] Kiev, 16 Mar -- Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk 
today received former U.S. President Richard Nixon who is on a 
private visit to Ukraine. A whole range of issues, touching 
upon the development of Ukrainian-U.S. relations, were discussed 
during the conversation. In particular, the possibilities and 
specific ways of attracting U.S. private capital in Ukraine's 
economy were discussed. Leonid Kravchuk informed the guest 
about the political and economic situation in Ukraine and about 
the progress of the reform. He pointed out that no matter what 
credits are granted by foreign countries, Ukraine's economy 
cannot be revived without solid investments. For its part, 
Ukraine will do everything possible to create the necessary 
conditions for the protection of investments, emphasized the 
president. Ukraine's legislation, too, serves this purpose. 
  Richard Nixon extended Leonid Kravchuk the best wishes from 
U.S. President Bill Clinton. He highly assessed the results of 
the recent visit by the president of Ukraine to the United 
States and the agreements achieved in the course of the visit. 
  The United States attributes great importance to relations 
with Ukraine and to the consolidation of its independence and 
regards it as a good partner in various spheres, emphasized 
Richard Nixon. I arrived in Ukraine to obtain, so to say, 
first-hand information about the situation in your country and 
to report on everything I saw and heard here to Bill Clinton 
upon my return to the United States. 
  Leonid Kravchuk asked Richard Nixon to give his best wishes 
to U.S. President Bill Clinton and declared that he recalls his 
visit to the United States and his meetings with the U.S. 
President with great pleasure.

  [Text] According to sources in the Black Sea Fleet's 
headquarters, Ukrainian servicemen seized the Black Sea Fleet's 
hospital in Ochakov (Ukraine's Nikolayev Region) on 14 March. 
  Ukrainian submachine-gunners do not allow medical personnel 
in, if the latter refuse to take an oath of allegiance to 
Ukraine. 
  Hospital workers said that Major Shevchenko of the Ukrainian 
armed forces had presented them an ultimatum in accordance with 
which they must either serve in the Ukrainian Armed Forces or 
will lose their jobs. 
  A high-ranking representative of the Black Sea Fleet, who 
preferred to remain anonymous, said that earlier this year 
Ukrainian submachine-gunners had seized the military hospital in 
Nikolayev. Special forces were involved. 
  The same source announced that the Black Sea Command 
qualified those actions as "actions carried out by uncontrolled 
bandit formations, because the Ukrainian Defense Ministry did 
not inform the Black Sea Command of its plans to resubordinate 
the Black Sea Fleet's establishments and units." 
  He stated that if such unilateral actions were repeated, the 
Black Sea Fleet personnel would be given the order to use arms 
to rebuff them.

  [Text] As UKRINFORM's correspondent in Sevastopol, Crimea, 
reported on Wednesday [16 March] the Ukrainian Navy's press 
center refuted a report by the Black Sea Fleet's press center 
about an alleged seizure by the Ukrainian naval personnel of a 
naval hospital in Ochakov. As the Ukrainian statement says, the 
hospital's personnel took an oath of allegiance to Ukraine and 
appealed to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and Navy command to 
enroll them as the Ukrainian Navy servicemen. Since then, the 
hospital has been strictly guarded, as when a similar situation 
evolved once in Nikolayev. The Black Sea Fleet command 
attempted to take away medical equipment and drugs from the 
local naval hospital, the statement explains.

  [Text] According to a report by the Ukrainian Navy press 
center, officers and more than 20 servicemen of the Black Sea 
Fleet's hospital in Ochakiv have asked the Ukrainian Defense 
Ministry and the Ukrainian Navy command to enroll them in the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces. They have recently taken an oath of 
allegiance to the Ukrainian people. The hospital staff 
explained that their decision was based on the fact that they 
are all Ukrainian citizens, and that they were tired of being 
hostages to circumstances, and to feeling the constant 
psychological pressure caused by the uncertainty of their fate. 
To prevent property and equipment from being taken away from 
the hospital, additional security was deployed during the oath. 
The press center report also notes that the command of the 
Black Sea Fleet Ochakiv Division failed to convince the officers 
to change their decision.

<F P=106> [Report by Ivan Vorotynskyy: "Minister Radetskyy Is at the </F>
Crossroads: Should We Go to NATO or to the Bath House?"] 
  [Text] Speaking at the flag-raising ceremony for the 
antisubmarine ship "Lutsk" in Sevastopol, Ukrainian Defense 
Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy said: "The Ukrainian Armed Forces are 
equipped well enough to be an equal partner with NATO." Jumping 
on the bandwagon has become a habit of the minister. Well, more 
power to him. However, there is more wind in the pockets than 
in the sails. 
  Studying the reconstruction potential of the Armed Forces 
from the small Czech Republic, independent Western experts 
concluded that even if 80 percent of the military budget was 
spent on this purpose, the restructuring would require at least 
12 years. Polish specialists estimated that to reach the 
armament level of the German and U.S. Armies, the Polish Army 
would have to receive 10 percent of the state budget for 20 
years. 
  For Ukraine, NATO is also an example of how to resolve the 
problem of unification of weapons and military equipment. The 
huge military industrial complex in Ukraine needs to be phased 
out because its production used to be oriented toward former 
Warsaw Pact countries. A new complex will take decades and huge 
expenses to establish. Let alone the fact that Ukraine has a 
range of military plants (the Lvov Radio and Television 
Equipment Amalgamation, the Dniepropetrovsk Rocket Plant, and 
Mariupol Ship Yard), whose products are even better than their 
NATO equivalents, such as the T80-M tank manufactured in 
Kharkov. Besides, Ukraine risks losing its niche on the arms 
market, which presently brings substantial profits to the state 
treasury. The "Partnership for Peace" has its social aspect in 
Ukraine as millions of people employed in the defense industry 
will be thrown out onto the street. 
  It does not take a military expert to understand that 
achieving NATO standards will demand changes in 
microelectronics, computers, optical equipment, radio 
electronics, and electronic surveillance. The AWACS digital 
communication systems, satellite meteorologic system, satellite 
system of strategic communications, integrated radiolocation 
system of intelligence and weapons management -- they are all 
part of NATO's equipment. Perhaps Defense Minister Radetskyy 
had in mind not the global problems of the "Partnership for 
Peace," but joint military exercises and maneuvers. But who 
will pay for all of this? Is the Ukrainian economy able to 
sustain even just a company exercise with NATO, let alone make 
preparations to become an "equal partner?" Last year, the 
Ukrainian Army did not hold a single exercise on the regimental 
level. At a meeting with officers from the Ivano-Frankovsk 
Garrison, Vitaliy Radetskyy complained that instead of resolving 
combat readiness issues, he is forced to think how to provide 
people with food and where he can get money for personnel to 
bathe in the bath house. The experience of joint Russian-U.S. 
exercises shows that in five to seven months, the Armies managed 
to prepare only a small military parade involving 250 servicemen 
on both sides. 
  According to one source of leaked information, NATO is going 
to earmark $10-$30 million annually for the "Partnership for 
Peace," which is, at best, some $1 million for cooperation with 
each member country. For Ukraine, the "Partnership" will cost 
at least $1 million. As usual, it is the people that will take 
most of the burden -- even though Ukraine should hardly expect 
that this much-vaunted program will secure military security 
guarantees for our state.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Serhiy Lavrenyuk: "Our Nuclear Weapons Are </F>
Already Gone. We May Also Be Deprived of Gas Pipelines"] 
  [Text] As we already reported, a Ukrainian Government 
delegation headed by Vice Prime Minister V. Landyk held 
negotiations in Moscow with representatives of the Russian 
"Gazprom" [Gas Industry] Joint Stock Association on gas supplies 
to Ukraine. According to the Russian side, Ukraine owes the 
"Gazprom" more than 1.5 trillion rubles [R] and, for that 
reason, the joint stock association adopted a decision to 
suspend the supplies of gas to our state if the debt is not 
repaid. However, as the gas pipelines run through the territory 
of Ukraine, Russia has been accusing the "Ukrgazprom" [Ukrainian 
gas industry] of regularly pumping out more than 40 million 
cubic meters of gas a day from the quantity of gas intended for 
Western Europe. As is known, Ukraine previously signed an 
agreement with Russia in accordance with which Ukraine took it 
upon itself to ensure the transit of 111.5 billion cubic meters 
of Russian gas to Western Europe. Russia, in turn, promised to 
supply to Ukraine between 50 and 70 billion cubic meters of gas. 
  However, the situation developed in such a way that Russia's 
pressure failed to affect Ukraine, because, by reducing gas 
supplies to our state, the joint stock association would also 
automatically reduce supplies to its European customers. In 
this way, Ukraine might try and reach an accord that would be 
most advantageous for it, as more than 90 percent of Russian gas 
is exported to Western Europe via Ukraine. In other words, 
Ukraine had an opportunity to dictate its own terms since Russia 
would hardly risk halting gas supplies, otherwise, this action 
would have primarily hit the "Gazprom." This is even more true 
since, in the opinion of specialists, gas reserves stored in 
underground reservoirs enable Ukraine to endure, without great 
difficulties, even full discontinuance of gas supplies for one 
month. 
  Russia, taking care of its own strategic interests, did not 
remain idle either. Back in September 1993, when Ukraine's debt 
reached R750 billion and the volume of gas supplied to Ukraine 
was reduced from 220 million cubic meters a day to 50 million, 
in order to test Ukraine's seriousness the "Gazprom" Joint-Stock 
Association made the proposal that Ukraine lease to the 
joint-stock association on a long-term basis some of Ukraine's 
gas-processing and gas transporting enterprises. Among them, 
the Russian side wanted to see gas supply depots in Kiev, 
Uzhhorod, and Nikolayev, underground gas reservoirs in western 
Ukraine, and mooring lines and port structures in Odessa and 
Illichevsk. The seriousness of the "Gazprom" intentions was 
also attested to by the fact that the association reacted 
extremely negatively to the proposal that the cost of nuclear 
weapons be compensated for by Ukraine by canceling its debt for 
energy sources, primarily natural gas. The reasons given were 
that "Gazprom" has its "major" interests in Ukraine. 
  Some of the results may be quoted. The negotiations ended in 
Russia's agreeing to resume gas supplies to Ukraine in full 
extent. Russia will also compensate for the 80-percent reduction 
in the supplies of Turkmenian gas. Ukraine, in turn, promises 
to repay, within one month, its debts for this year's gas 
supplies with Russian rubles and freely convertible currency and 
last year's debts -- both with money and equipment for the gas 
extraction industry. Besides, during the meeting, accords were 
reached on joint ownership of gas pipelines and underground gas 
reservoirs. The share of the "Gazprom" is to be determined 
during the next meeting, which will be held on 10 April. Thus, 
as one can see, Russia is steadily heading toward its goal: To 
take into its (although partial) ownership, gas pipelines and 
gas reservoirs and do anything it wants with Ukrainian gas 
consumers.

<F P=106> ["The Clue to Ukraine's Gas Procurement Problem Appears To </F>
Be in the Domain of Politics" -- UKRINFORM headline from the 
"Business News Weekly" feature No. 11, 7-13 Mar 94] 
  [Text] According to the Ukrgazprom concern, Russia's 
Gazprom joint-stock association supplied 1,280.1 million cu. m. 
[cubic meters] of natural gas to Ukraine between 1 and 10 March 
1994, which was even more than the planned amount (by 128.1 
million cu. m.) 
  Obviously, Gazprom's statement about its alleged intention 
to 
drastically curtail Russian natural gas supplies to Ukraine, 
which was widely circulated by the media, cried wolf. 
  In the meantime, on 10 March Moscow was the venue of 
negotiations between Russia's Gazprom and a Ukrainian government 
delegation led by vice-premier Valentin Landik on the sensitive 
issue of Russian gas supplies to Ukraine. 
  The crucial negotiations resulted in an articulated 
agreement 
on Russian gas supply resumption in full. The Russian side went 
even further to state its intention to supply about 80 per cent 
of natural gas, which Ukraine used to receive from Turkmenistan 
or would have received from there has it not been for the 
Central Asian nation's decision to discontinue its natural gas 
supplies to Ukraine. 
  According to the Ukrainian vice-premier, a protocol was 
signed in Moscow, under which the two parties pledged to arrange 
their account settling within a month. Ukraine's gas 
indebtedness for the 1994, first quarter's supplies will be 
repaid via monetary means. 1993's indebtedness (which, as 
Gazprom's spokepersons maintain, exceeds 1.5 trillion rubles) is 
to be repaid, in 50 per cent parts, in hard currency and Russian 
rubles, and via equipment and material supplies to Russian 
natural gas extractors. 
  Russia's statements, blaming Ukraine for allegedly curtailed 
natural gas supplies to Russia's West European customers in late 
January and early February, perhaps, should also be taken with a 
grain of salt. In real fact, precisely at that time, Russia's 
Gazprom attempted to make its West European clients, primarily 
Germany, pay higher prices for its gas through curtailed gas 
exports on its own. 
  According to Ukrgazprom, the Russian exporter curtailed gas 
supplies in a most drastic manner to Germany, Bulgaria, Turkey 
and Hungary. 
  Russian natural gas transit across Ukraine's territory in 
January and February, 1994 could be characterized by the 
following data: 


                January                        February 

                Factual      In excess of      Factual      In excess of

Turkey 

Hungary         498.9        -188.0            451.3        -187.1 


  Though none of Ukrgazprom officials chose to assume 
responsibility of making a statement to refute accusations 
against Ukraine of allegedly using Russian gas intended for 
exports to West Europe, which were circulated by Russia's and 
Hungary's media, such accusations provided grounds to Russia to 
lay the blame for natural gas undersupplies to West Europe at 
Ukraine's door. 
  Nonetheless, during a meeting on 11 March with Hungarian 
President A. Genz Ukraine's Ambassador to Hungary D. Tkach 
assured him, on behalf of the Ukrainian State Committee for oil 
and gas, to which Ukrgazprom is immediately reportable, that 
Ukraine would unswervingly comply with its natural gas transit 
commitments. 
  As it also became known, the Ukrainian side agreed to 
consider the issue of allowing Russia to jointly own some of 
Ukraine's major pipe-lines and underground gas storages, which 
will be negotiated at a bilateral Russo-Ukrainian meeting on 10 
April. 
  In view of the upcoming process of transforming state-owned 
enterprises within Ukraine's petroleum-gas complex into 
joint-stock societies (which is expected to start, when 
President Kravchuk signs the draft decree "On procedures for 
preparing for selling stocks of open-type joint-stock societies 
established through corporatization") the Russian side's demand 
may be met quite legitimately through acquisition by Russian 
enterprises of Ukrgazprom's stocks. 
  However, Russia's joint ownership of Ukraine's pipe-line 
network and underground reservoirs will require a decision by 
the government, since, according to the endorsed documents for 
Ukrgazprom's corporatization, both the gas transport network and 
underground storages should remain the state's property. 
  Russia's access to Ukraine's gas pipe-line system as the 
latter's co-owner, personified by Gazprom, is supposed to 
guarantee security of Russian natural gas supplies to West 
Europe, since Ukraine will not be in a position to unilaterally 
pump out the exported raw material for its own needs, should 
supplies to Ukraine be curtailed. 
  More likely than not, in case the scheme materializes, 
Russia will be able to quite legally shift a part of 
responsibility for any undersupplies likely to happen to 
Ukraine. Presently, the declared by Russia curtailment of 
natural gas supplies to Ukraine is technically very hard to 
verify. 
  Moreover, the Ukrainian party will become legally liable 
before Russian natural gas buyers and very unlikely to dictate 
its charges for transit services. 
  No reliable and exact data are currently available about 
what 
facilities may be turned over to Russia. Yet, back in September 
1993, when Ukraine's fuel indebtedness to Russia reached the 
ball park of 750 billion rubles, Gazprom ventilated long-term 
lease of certain facilities in Ukraine as a minimal and partial 
redemption of the debt. These reportedly included gas supply 
depots in Kiev, Uzhgorod, Nikolaev, underground gas storages in 
Ukraine's border regions, as well as port facilities in Odessa 
and Ilyichevsk. 
  Russia's Gazprom is also known to have vigorously opposed a 
plan, which provided for repayment of a part of Ukraine's fuel 
debt to Russia by means of nuclear weapons, dismantled in 
Ukraine and transferred to Russia. 
  However, on 17 January 1994, when an agreement was reached 
on 
gas supplies to Ukraine, Gazprom pledged to keep to this 
schedule of supplies: 10.3 b. cu. m. in the 1st quarter, 15.6 
b. cu. m. in the 2nd quarter, 18.2 b. cu. m. in the 3d quarter, 
and 7.8 b. cu. m. in the last quarter of 1994. As Ukrainian 
gas officials maintain, the schedule is not very convenient for 
Ukraine, in technological terms. 
  Proceeding from data, regularly published by UBN [UKRINFORM 
Business News], the latest agreements on the parties' 
obligations Gazprom appears intent on shrinking to the agreed 
supply schedule. 
  Reductions in total gas import amounts due to supply 
discontinuance by Turkmenistan were not so critical as to make 
the situation a crisis one, Taras Freyuk, Ukrgaz deputy chief 
asserts. Moreover, a spell of warm weather, which has recently 
set in, allows to radically reduce natural gas consumption by 
housing and public utilities, which normally account for about a 
third of the nation's total natural gas consumption. 
  As statistical data suggest, a one-degree drop in 
temperature 
entails extraconsumption of 4.5 million cu. m. of gas 
Ukraine-wide. According to T. Freyuk, daily gas consumption by 
the above sector dropped by 100 million cu. m. 
  All-in-all, during the 1-10 March period Ukraine's gas 
consumption amounted to 2,983.6 million cu. m., according to 
Ukrgazprom sources, which was by 520.4 million cu. m. less than 
expected. 
  Only debtor enterprises among Ukraine's over 80,000 
enterprises were hit by curtailed gas supplies. Many of 
enterprises shifted to alternative fuels, such as oil fuel, if 
their technological processes allowed to do so. 
  However, as T. Freyuk maintains, Ukraine's domestic payment 
crisis remains a major challenge. The gas supply problem would 
be automatically resolved, were it not for the 
consumer-enterprises' untimely payments for fuels supplied to 
them. 
  According to both Ukrgazprom and Ukrgaz spokespersons, many 
debtor enterprises start repaying their debts only after gas 
supplies to them are curtailed and they are notified about 
imminent supply suspension. 
  State-budgeted enterprises, including those of the housing 
and public amenities sector, are entitled to continuous gas 
supplies, though. 
  So far, Turkmen natural gas supplies have not resumed after 
they were discontinued on 22 February 1994 by the Turkmen 
government's decision in view of Ukraine's indebtedness. 
  According to formation, which was disclosed by Ukrgazprom's 
operational and dispatching service sources; not a single cu. m. 
of Turkmen natural gas has reached Ukraine since then. The 
issue of Turkmen gas supply resumption remains thus suspended. 
  Ukrgazprom's spokespersons refused to confirm information 
about Turkmenistan's official statement to the effect of its 
intention to sell its gas to Russia, should Ukraine fail to 
comply with Turkmenistan's terms, and Russia likely to resell it 
then to Ukraine, at a much higher price. Turkmen natural gas 
was priced at 50 US dollars per 1,000 cu. m. 
  Nonetheless, such a decision by Turkmenistan appears to be a 
likely one, considering Russia's agreement to supply 80 per cent 
of the amount, which Turkmenistan earlier undertook to supply to 
Ukraine. The price and duration issue with regard to these 
supplies has not been settled yet. 
  As Andrew Marshall, a participant in the current session of 
the European Parliament, tends to believe, Russia played a trump 
card with Turkmenistan both to bring pressure to bear on 
Ukraine's and demonstrate its prestige and significance in the 
East-European region. 
  Pedalling Ukraine's gas supply challenge has also spurred 
the 
USA to increase its aid to Ukraine and prompted Britain to 
offers its go-between services in a bid to muster support from 
international financial institutions and elicit credits to 
Ukraine to repay its fuel debt to Russia. 
  So, it is Russia, who appears primarily to benefit from this 
problem's shift from the field of economics to the domain of 
politics, and very likely to have gains in both.

  [Text] To begin one's activity in the position of Crimean 
president by violating the Ukrainian Constitution is a challenge 
to democracy. This was said by Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk at a meeting with Ukrainian and foreign journalists 
today in Kiev. He characterized the actions by Yuriy Meshkov as 
contradictory to the basic law of our state. At the same time, 
Leonid Kravchuk reiterated that during his personal meeting with 
the Crimean president, he proposed to the latter that they hold 
close contacts and take preliminary steps to sort things out in 
Crimea. Meshkov, however, claims that the president of Ukraine 
did not adhere to the agreements, and issued an edict on holding 
a referendum. By the way, even the autonomous Central Election 
Commission expressed hope that he would bring the documents in 
line with Crimean legislation. All responsibility for any 
possible complications will fall upon Mr. Meshkov, stressed 
Leonid Kravchuk.

  [Text] The Crimean referendum on relations with Ukraine 
scheduled for 27 March will be held despite Kiev's ban, Crimean 
President Yuriy Meshkov told INTERFAX on Wednesday. 
  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk issued a decree late on 
Tuesday [15 March] to ban the Crimean poll because of its being 
out of line with the Ukrainian Constitution and laws. 
  The Crimean referendum ordered by Meshkov is designed to 
elicit an answer to two questions. One is on relations between 
Simferopol and Kiev and the other on dual citizenship. 
  Meshkov said that such questions "are to be decided locally 
and not by Kiev" warning against attempts to try to deprive the 
public of its right to freedom of expression. 
  He said that an administrative ban was an on-off affair 
because the referendum issue might resurface within a week or a 
month again. 
  "There is a body of opinion which Kiev may find more useful 
to know of than Simferopol", Meshkov said adding that he saw no 
reason for further discussion on that score.

<F P=106> [Interview with Candidate of Technical Sciences A.S. </F>
Golovizin, general director of the "Partner" Crimean association 
for economic cooperation and chairman of the Economic Council of 
the Union of Entrepreneurs of the Crimean Republic, by V. 
Savchenko; place and date not given: "How Long Will We Continue 
To Operate Outside the Law?"] 
  [Text] A day hardly goes by now when there is not a report 
in the newspaper, or over radio and television, on the shutdown 
of one enterprise or another, on energy supply problems, or on 
failure to make payments. Things are bad everywhere in 
industry, in agriculture, and in the business structures engaged 
in production. They are very bad. How can we overcome this 
crisis in the economy? Is it not time to stop destroying our 
production? These and other questions disturb Candidate of 
Technical Sciences A.S. Golovizin, general director of the 
"Partner" Crimean association for economic cooperation and 
chairman of the Economic Council of the Union of Entrepreneurs 
of the Crimean Republic, who speaks with us today. 
  [Golovizin] When you analyze crisis situations in other 
countries, you see that the one thing that survives is 
transnational companies--which have a diversified structure of 
production and trade, and powerful investments in scientific 
development. But we, unfortunately, in essence primarily a 
transnational company, have initiated the destruction of all 
economic ties with partners in the former USSR. 
  [Savchenko] But this is not the only factor that led to the 
collapse of the economy. 
  [Golovizin] Yes. The state also failed to concern itself 
with drawing up state orders. Whereas in the West a powerful 
struggle ensues to obtain these, up to and including bribing 
members of the parliament, we have no experience at all in 
incorporating them. Having declared that it would pursue the 
option of defense industry conversion, the state should have 
determined priority programs, presented them on a competitive 
basis as state orders among enterprises, allocated financing on 
preferential terms for production development, and afforded tax 
privileges, and as they say, move on from there. But nothing of 
the kind took place either in Ukraine or in Russia. 
  We have reached the point today when 70 percent, on the 
average, of the equipment at enterprises is physically worn out, 
and a full 90 percent are obsolete; and no efforts are under way 
to replace it. We see a degradation of our entire production. 
  Following in Russia's footsteps, Ukraine repeated its 
serious 
mistake and announced the liberalization of prices under 
conditions of deeply entrenched monopolism. Everyone is now 
getting a personal sense of what this alienation of the state 
from price regulation has brought about. Incidentally, not one 
recognized economist in the West suggested that we carry out 
such proposals. 
  [Savchenko] Also characteristic of Ukraine is the fiscal 
system of taxation. Crimean producers have been screaming about 
this for the past two years, but, alas, no one is listening. 
  [Golovizin] In a speech that I delivered before the Third 
Ukrainian Congress of Entrepreneurs, attended by the president 
and the deputy prime minister, I stated that the Government of 
Ukraine was the chief racketeer in Ukraine, the state racketeer. 
Under the present system of taxation, it is at times necessary, 
for every ruble of trade production output, to hand over 1.6 in 
the form of taxes. Where else do you see that? And this is 
happening at a time when our wage standards have dropped 
significantly, although you constantly hear it said that reforms 
are being conducted for the benefit of the individual, for the 
sake of improving his life, done for his benefit, while actual 
results show that the individual is becoming impoverished, 
plants are shutting down, production is being curtailed, and 
incomes are diminishing. 
  [Savchenko] The system of taxation has also hit 
entrepreneurial structures quite hard. Where have the stock 
exchanges gone, for example? 
  [Golovizin] In 1991 we saw a boom in their establishment. 
There were 76 of them in Ukraine, 15 in Crimea. But on 10 
February 1992, the parliament of Ukraine adopted the Law on 
Taxation, which prescribes that income obtained from stock 
exchange activity is subject to tax at a rate of 75 percent. So 
you complete a transaction for R1,000 [rubles], but all you have 
left is 15--the state collects the rest. Therefore, all the 
stock exchanges virtually died. We continue to say that they 
are lying on the bottom, like a ship that has suffered colossal 
damage. 
  Knowing, however, that not a single state with any economy 
can survive without a stock exchange, we have now decided to 
join the Crimean Universal Stock Exchange with the Agricultural 
Stock Exchange and begin operations. This is how we are 
thinking about getting around the system of taxation. 
  Can it possibly be a victory for the state when it forces 
the 
stock exchanges and other entrepreneurs to withdraw into a 
shadow economy? After all, we know that something on the order 
of 12 trillion karbovantsy are in cash circulation right now. 
This money does not go through the banks or help augment the 
budget. It is corrupting businessmen and contributing toward 
the emergence of racketeering. 
  [Savchenko] Instead of civilized trade on the stock 
exchange, we now have a middleman. 
  [Golovizin] It is easy to find someone for a soft job. 
Thanks to the middlemen who purchase commodities two, three, 
and four times from one another, the commodity goes up 1.5- or 
2-fold in price. I am convinced that if we return the stock 
exchange and wholesale purchase bases to a civilized course and 
afford them low-interest credit, the standard of living of the 
populace will rise tomorrow. There will be a sharp drop in 
prices. And the middlemen will go back to civilized work. 
Today many people say they do not want to work on the edge of 
violating the law, but otherwise they have to eat bread crumbs. 
  [Savchenko] How do you feel about the introduction in Crimea 
of the system of an open economy? 
  [Golovizin] With its available potential, Crimea has to be 
an international business center. It is situated at a 
crossroads--of trade, political, cultural, and spiritual paths. 
This is a unique position. In the West they determine the 
optimal zone of economic relations using a compass. They draw a 
circle with radius of 600 km. Some 22 independent, highly 
developed states find themselves neighbors with Crimea in such a 
circle. Where else in the world could you find such a unique 
position? 
  [Savchenko] What is the best possible thing for our 
structures of authority and entrepreneurial structures to do? 
  [Golovizin] They must enter into direct ties with other 
states, including Russia, create joint enterprises, and act more 
boldly. Here in Crimea we have all the conditions for 
establishment of a business center, including suitable buildings 
that could house the headquarters for economic reform of Crimea. 
Here we must attract the entire scientific potential of the 
republic. 
  [Savchenko] All possible kinds of funds and joint-stock 
companies have recently been sprouting up everywhere. Readers 
are constantly asking: "Can they be trusted?" How do you answer 
them? 
  [Golovizin] There is not a single fund, not a single joint- 
stock company advertising itself in the newspapers or on 
television that carries out its main practical functions. 
Stockholders do not know what kind of charter fund they have, 
how accumulation of funds takes place, in what specific 
undertaking funds are invested, or what safeguards are in place. 
On the other hand, "the guys" are very good at manipulating 
money while having nothing to do with the production that 
results in accumulation of the country's basic wealth. 
  [Savchenko] We will soon elect a new parliament. What 
should be the starting point of its work? 
  [Golovizin] It should start by adopting three laws: one on 
the credit and finance system, one on the budget of Crimea, and 
another on taxation. This is the basis of development of the 
economy. When this is done, we will be able to stand on our 
feet and move forward rapidly.

  [Text] [Word indistinct] one can assert that there are two 
problems of prime concern for the current leadership of Ukraine. 
The first is the economic situation and the second is the 
problem of regional separatism; and Crimea is a kind of a symbol 
of this separatism. We would like to remind you that such a hot 
spot does exist now. And we think that it will be interesting 
for you, dear listeners, to hear the opinion of the chief of the 
Security Service of Ukraine, Yevhen Marchuk, about the political 
situation in Crimea. 
  [Begin Marchuk recording] The Crimean problem, the problem 
of 
regionalization as a whole, threatens decentralization of the 
state. This is one of those threats that today occupies one of 
the leading places in the hierarchy of threats to national 
security in Ukraine. This is due to a number of reasons: 
historical, economic, ethnic, etc. Crimea, as a problem, 
concentrated one of the elements of this threat. Although, at 
the same time, I would not dramatize the situation in Crimea as 
reminiscent of some Yugoslav variant. Nothing like this will 
happen here because the situation is absolutely different and 
there are enough forces and those necessary to prevent the 
Yugoslav variant from happening. Nothing like this will happen 
here, but at the same time, a whole number of political forces 
in Crimea, parties and movements, which are carrying out 
propaganda activity, are doing this -- as a matter of fact, to 
the detriment of Ukraine's interests. But I emphasize that 
political propaganda activity, which political structures and 
separate leaders who create this atmosphere are engaged in, is 
one thing; it cannot be viewed now from the point of view of the 
Criminal Code. This is why the methods to be applied to this 
phenomena should be of relevant nature -- first and foremost, 
political. Any propaganda should be countered by 
antipropaganda: more effective, more reasonable, more 
understandable and so on. And the methods of propaganda itself. 
[as heard] And, possibly, being aware of the patriotic 
sentiments of some people's deputies, their desire to improve 
somehow the situation in Crimea... [pauses]. But with some of 
their actions and even visits they, unfortunately, were 
aggravating the situation instead of easing it. 
  We are doing what the special services should do, and this 
is 
under relevant control. We have been doing something. I cannot 
dwell on this in public but this is within the framework of the 
Ukrainian laws. We have made our contribution. Probably it is 
not as ponderable as we would like it to be, but this is a 
different thing. However, I am absolutely convinced that it is 
only by means of a centralized, sufficiently considered, 
strategically calculated domestic nationalities policy in 
relation to all regions -- Donbass, Transcarpathia, Bukovina, 
and not only Crimea -- that we shall be able to neutralize and 
solve such problems in a timely, quiet, and civilized manner. 
Naturally, the security service, the prosecutor's office, the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, etc. should be assigned 
corresponding roles in this. However, personally I am for 
neutralizing such phenomena by political methods involving 
special services in this work within the framework of the law. 
  If 1.2 million people have such sentiments, this is already 
a 
policy. One person speaking does not shape a policy. But when 
more than 1.2 million people speak, this is a policy and this 
means that it is necessary to examine and analyze rather 
seriously what blunders were made in the internal nationalities 
policy. Although, I know that at present both the new Crimean 
administration, which has become confronted with everyday 
economic problems... [changes thought]. Now it pays little 
attention if any at all to rallying because it has to solve 
specific economic issues daily. 
  Ukraine -- I have in mind Kiev -- gave rather a good example 
when the Crimean delegation, the economic delegation of the 
Council of Ministers of Crimea, was here, when it was working at 
the Cabinet of Ministers. They were working up issues 
pertaining to the Crimean budget and correlation between the 
state and the Crimean, i.e. all-Ukrainian and Crimean aspects 
of the budget and also issues pertaining to the property of 
Crimea and Ukraine. Then Ukraine gave rather a good example of 
tolerance and at the same time of a firm policy of principle in 
relation to Crimea: Crimea is part of Ukraine and there is no 
other option and no one can comment on this off-handedly, but at 
the same time all the aspects of the economic activity for which 
the Crimean leadership is now responsible, were shifted entirely 
to the Crimean leadership's shoulders, as they say. Therefore, 
where there is the Crimean budget they must administer it 
themselves, and where there is the state budget, this is the 
state budget. 
  And it was rather interesting to observe how.... [pauses] 
From the human point of view it was clear why the Crimean 
delegation representatives were raising the question that money 
would be needed for this and for that. The problems they were 
bringing up were correct. But then they were asked the 
following question: These problems, in compliance with the 
delimitation of plenary powers, are they Crimean problems or 
all-Ukrainian ones? Generally speaking, they are Crimean 
problems. In this case you have your Crimean budget. Our 
budget is also bearly alive, as they say. So, it is your 
responsibility, this is the burden of the state activity when it 
is necessary to balance, to find relevant solutions within the 
framework of the allocated budget. 
  If there is a calm but far-sighted internal nationalities 
policy, and it is being worked up at present, if there is a calm 
economic policy Crimea-Ukraine and Crimea in Ukraine as well as 
Ukraine-foreign countries and Crimea-foreign countries via 
Ukraine, and if there is an improvement of the economy as a 
whole in the state, I am absolutely convinced that very many 
issues pertaining to the Crimean situation will be removed. 
  No matter how paradoxical this is, at present, the situation 
in the Crimea, from the point of view of the aggravation of the 
situation, is much calmer than it was two months ago, because 
much has been implemented there as far as political aspects are 
concerned, and then [word indistinct] problems. And now the 
president of Crimea, his experts and the Council of Ministers of 
Crimea have to tackle the issues which discipline them. 
  To wind up my personal vision of the developments in the 
Crimea, the situation will not be simple, because there are 
political structures in Russia, and not even Zhirinovskiy or 
anybody else sharing his views, because there are various 
figures who just cannot say what Zhirinovskiy says, but who 
think exactly the way he thinks. [sentence as heard] That is to 
say, Zhirinovskiy [word indistinct] their alter ego, and it 
would be naive to think that this issue will be removed. 
Although, here in Ukraine there is quite a serious [word 
indistinct] argument: The trilateral statement by the presidents 
of Russia, Ukraine, and the United States concerning nuclear 
weapons in Ukraine and solution of this issue. Moreover, these 
states guarantee Ukraine's territorial integrity and this 
argument will be quite instrumental, because the world today 
differs from what it was 30 or even 10 years ago. That is to 
say, all this will be under a rather serious international 
control. 
  This is why, on the one hand, I see that there will be 
enough 
difficulties: It is clear that both the internal political 
situation in Crimea and the political structures in Russia will 
undoubtedly encourage Crimea's drifting toward Russia. There 
must be no illusions here, as they say. However, the 
possibilities [word indistinct] available to Ukraine, I have in 
mind political possibilities first and foremost, as well as 
historic aspects, as they say, and all other aspects, as I am 
convinced they are much more complicated, and the situation in 
the world will help us straighten out the situation in Crimea 
gradually, [word indistinct] step by step. There will be no 
Yugoslav variant here. [end recording] 
  That was the chief of the Security Service of Ukraine, 
Yevhen 
Marchuk, sharing his views about the situation in Crimea.

<F P=106> [Article by Ulrich Blumenschein: "Ukraine Builds Military </F>
Supertransporter: First Antonov-70 Manufactured -- Range 5,000 
Km -- 600-Meter Unsurfaced Takeoff Runway Sufficient"] 
  [Text] The former Soviet aviation industry is far from 
being dead, as became clear when a new aircraft unequaled in the 
West was presented recently at the Antonov aircraft works in 
Kiev, in the Ukraine. After all of 12 years' development, the 
four-engined An-70 transport plane has had its rollout, the 
ceremony, similar to the launch of a ship, that marks the 
beginning of the trial phase. 
  Neither the An-70's 500-km range nor its 35-tonne freight 
capacity is its most striking feature. What is sensational is 
its ability to take off, fully loaded, from an unsurfaced runway 
only 600 m long. 
  The An-70 is the latest in a long series of Antonov 
transport 
planes that includes the An-12 (NATO code: Cub), which for 30 
years constituted the East Bloc armed forces' flying workhorse. 
In the seventies, the Soviet Air Force used to boast that its 
An-12 aircraft alone were sufficient to displace two entire 
armed divisions -- 14,000 men plus arms and equipment -- in one 
go over a distance of 1,200 km. 
  The An-72 "Coaler," which put in a surprise appearance at 
the 
1979 Paris air show, aroused particular interest. It was a 
curious-looking transport plane for short takeoff and landing 
runways with two jet engines mounted at the front of the wings. 
This unconventional configuration was designed to direct the 
exhaust plume over the upper surface of the wings, a technique 
that makes for a considerable increase in lift; the specialists 
refer to it as the "Coanda effect." 
  The new An-70 exploits the Coanda effect in a modified form. 
It is not a jet, but a turboprop. Four Progress turbines built 
at the Saporoshje Works are each driven by two counterrotating 
propellers with extremely broad, saber-shaped, curved blades. 
According to the engineering office, their airflow gives rise 
to a supercirculation phenomenon on the wings that doubles lift 
during takeoff and landing, shortening runway requirements 
accordingly. 
  The eight strange, 4.5-m diameter propellers, which look 
more 
like large marine screw propellers, give the airborne aircraft a 
speed only marginally lower than that of a fast jet transporter. 
The designers thus calculate that, at an altitude of 8,500 m, 
the An-70 will be capable of flying 30-percent faster than the 
American Hercules or the Bundeswehr's Transall, although it will 
be half as slow again in the critical takeoff and landing phases. 
  The An-70's hold measures 4 x 4 x 16 m, three times the 
capacity of the An-12 or Transall fuselage. The gigantic hold 
can accommodate practically any military vehicle or weapon 
system. 
  The An-70's system of digital on-board electronics meets 
western standards and is more advanced than that of the 
much-extolled MiG-29 supersonic fighter aircraft. 
  The Russian Air Force is very interested in the An-70, and 
the aircraft may well take on great importance as a freight 
plane in view of the shortcomings of the railway system in the 
CIS states. 
  The An-70, which western experts describe as technically 
brilliant, is scheduled to take off for its first test flight in 
April. What happens after that depends primarily on how 
relations between the Ukraine and Russia develop.

  [Text] The Coordinating Council of the Association of 
Democratic Forces "Spring-94" has issued a statement denouncing 
the stance of the Belarusian Government regarding the activities 
of the Belarusian mass media. "The prevailing majority of mass 
media are, as before, in the hands of the executive bodies," the 
statement reads. "Leaders of the government overtly declare 
that media which do not support the government will not be 
granted subsidies." The authors of the statement demand that 
space in newspapers and even broadcasting time be issued by the 
government to various parties and political associations to 
allow them the opportunity to clarify their platforms during the 
elections.

<F P=106> [Report by Valer Kalinowski: "Belarusian Popular Front Will </F>
Not Support Shushkevich"] 
  [Text] On 12 March, the Belarusian Popular Front [BNF] 
Council discussed the development of the political situation and 
prospects for elections in Belarus. As was pointed out by 
Zyanon Paznyak, the BNF does not aim to electioneer before the 
adoption of the constitution, as is being done by S. 
Shushkevich, M. Hryb, and A. Lukashenka during their numerous 
clamorous tours across the Republic. However as soon as the 
elections are announced, the BNF will definitely launch its 
electoral campaign. According to Y. Khadyka, the BNF has plans 
to reach a preelection agreement with other parties. The 
content of the agreement will depend on the concrete situation 
and will, at a maximum, envision support for one candidate or, 
at a minimum, joint control over observance of the law in the 
course of the elections. The BNF leadership believes that their 
organization has realistic chances for success. Yet, according 
to Z. Paznyak, this would happen only if the electorate faces a 
clear-cut dilemma of choosing between a man from the opposition 
and a representative of the old nomenklatura. A third candidate 
and a third way would be a threat. Zyanon Paznyak pointed out 
that Stanislav Shushkevich is the man specifically threatening 
BNF's future and added: "Someone either advocates independence 
or opposes it; there is no other option." In Paznyak's opinion, 
Shushkevich is the concrete politician responsible for what 
happened in Belarus. 
  Due to BNF support, Shushkevich became deputy chairman and 
then chairman of the Belarusian legislature. However in the 
end, he abandoned the BNF and chose his own path, tolerating the 
annulment of the referendum and the legalization of the 
Communist Party of Belarus. The BNF cannot forgive this. Thus, 
Paznyak pointed out, (and was supported by other council 
members), the Popular Front would no longer support Shushkevich 
and quite probably, would campaign against him. Shushkevich's 
aspiration to take part in presidential elections and his 
attempts to look for support from political parties and the 
electorate had evidently irritated the BNF. In Paznyak's 
opinion, "This situation causes confusion and discord in the 
democratic camp. Democrats will lose. When opportunists come 
to the fore, the nomenklatura will be victorious." 
  Nevertheless, the BNF faction believes that it is rather 
improbable that there will be several candidates for president. 
The draft law on presidential elections provides for the 
nomination of candidates by either 70 lawmakers or 100,000 
electors. Alternative candidates will encounter enormous 
difficulties. However the BNF is not going to dodge them. 
Making use of its experience, the organization will begin 
collecting signatures, aware that a candidate nominated by the 
electorate will be in an advantageous position as compared to 
his opponent nominated by Supreme Soviet deputies. In the 
electoral campaign, the BNF intends to seek support from young 
people, workers, and intelligentsia. It also stresses the need 
to form veterans and pensioners organizations faithful to the 
idea of independence, and to appeal for women's support.

  [Excerpt] It has already been reported that yesterday the 
Supreme Soviet of Belarus adopted the fundamental law of the 
Republic of Belarus. The main difference between the present 
Constitution and the one adopted in 1978 lies in the fact that 
it envisions a change in the state structure -- Belarus becomes 
a presidential republic. According to the new constitution, the 
Republic of Belarus is declared to be: a unitary, democratic, 
social, law-governed state. Man is considered the supreme value 
of society and the state. Belarus sets the aim of making its 
territory non-nuclear and the state neutral. 
  The president of the republic is the head of executive 
power. 
The parliament is reduced from 360 to 260 members. It remains 
semiprofessional, i.e. some of the deputies work on a 
professional basis in permanent commissions and the others 
combine their duties as MPs with other work. 
  The Constitution enters into effect from the moment of being 
published. One month after that the republic's Constitutional 
Court is to be set up. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Today, Belarus began to receive full gas deliveries 
from Russia. Gasprom resumed supplying its earlier volume of 
blue fuel to the Republic. By the end of Tuesday [15 March], 
deliveries are expected to reach earlier [word indistinct] 
volume of 54 million cubic meters. This was agreed by Russia's 
Gasprom and the Belarusian Beltransgas during their negotiations 
in Moscow. 
  A delegation of gas-industry specialists from Belarus, 
headed 
by Beltransgas Director Mikalay Macharnyak, went to Moscow for 
the sole purpose of discussing conditions for repaying 
Belarusian debts for Russian natural gas deliveries. In line 
with agreements reached with Ukraine's partners, 150 percent [as 
heard] of Belarusian debts for last year's deliveries will be 
settled by financial means while 50 percent will be met by 
supplying Russia's Gasprom with equipment and materiel. This 
year's debt will be settled by financial means. A repayment 
schedule for this quarter has already been agreed upon. An 
agreement in principle has also been reached on the joint 
ownership of property of the territory of Belarus, but the 
actual Russian ownership share will be determined at a later 
date. According to ITAR-TASS, it was determined that a final 
resolution of the questions under discussion will be adopted 
within the next 10 days.

  [Text] President Mircea Snegur has signed in Brussels the 
document on the Republic of Moldova's adherence to the 
Partnership for Peace [PFP] program. 
  As our press correspondent, Andrei Barsan, reported in his 
speech given after the signing of the framework document, NATO 
General Secretary Manfred Woerner emphasized that by joining the 
PFP concept, the Republic of Moldova demonstrates that it shares 
the main objective pursued by the Alliance: Building a European 
order of peace that is based on the principles of democracy and 
human rights. 
  Referring to problems in the east of Moldova, Manfred 
Woerner 
said that the Alliance supports a rapid and complete withdrawal 
of foreign troops from that area and hopes that a rapid peaceful 
solution may be found in connection with the said problems. 
  In turn, President Mircea Snegur said that, as a trustworthy 
partner, Moldova will strengthen its bilateral relations with 
Central and East European countries and will cooperate honestly 
with the Euro-Atlantic security structures in accordance with 
the PFP principles and objectives. 
  We pay special attention to the mechanism of consultations 
on 
security stipulated by the PFP, particularly when a 
participating state believes that it is facing a direct threat 
against its territorial integrity, political independence, and 
national security. This is all the more important since the 
said principles are questioned today by the presence of foreign 
troops on the territory of Moldova; something that represents 
the main obstacle for a definitive political solution to the 
conflict in the east of Moldova.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, 16 Mar TASS -- Moldova has become the 12th 
state to join the Partnership for Peace programme offered by 
NATO to former Soviet Republics and East European countries in 
January. 
  Moldovan President Mircea Snegur signed the appropriate 
agreement in NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday. 
  Speaking at the signing ceremony, the Moldovan leader said 
that the Partnership for Peace programme would certainly help 
strengthen national security and territorial integrity of his 
country. 
  Snegur said he was ready to begin working out proposals to 
conclude a bilateral partnership agreement which would define 
the character and the extent of Moldovan cooperation with NATO. 
  Snegur also said the mechanism of consultations with NATO 
envisaged by the "Partnership for Peace" is very important for 
any country whose territorial integrity, political independence, 
and security are threatened. 
  The Moldovan president reiterated that the 14th Russian Army 
deployed on moldovan territory plays the main stumbling effect 
for the political settlement of the conflict between Moldova and 
its eastern Dniester province. 
  According to Snegur, negotiations should be held on the 
terms 
of troops withdrawal. He expressed confidence that the new 
Moldovan parliament would adopt a law granting the Dniester 
province a special legal status to help the withdrawal of the 
14th Russian Army. 
  NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said that NATO 
favours 
a prompt and complete withdrawal of foreign troops from Moldova. 
  He also emphasised that in the proposed partnership scheme, 
the North Atlantic alliance does not want to exclude or isolate 
any country. NATO expects Russia to join the "Partnership for 
Peace" programme, Woerner stressed. The participation of all 
invited countries will play an important role in implementing 
our efforts to build a new Europe, he said. 
  Today, Moldova, Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Estonia, 
Hungary, 
Ukraine, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Latvia, and Czech Republic have 
joined the "Partnership for Peace" programme. Many leaders of 
these countries consider joining this programme as the first 
step towards full membership in NATO. 
  Russia has expressed its support for the programme, 
estimating it as a mechanism of strengthening security of 
coopration in Europe.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Mircea Snegur by Pol Mathil; place </F>
and date not given: "Mircea Snegur On Moldova And Europe"] 
  [Text] [Mathil] How are we supposed to call your country: 
Moldavia or Moldova? 
  [Snegur] Moldova. 
  [Mathil] Why? 
  [Snegur] Because that is what our ancestors called it. It is 
the name of a river. Moldavia is more Russian. 
  [Mathil] Is your national anthem still the same as 
Romania's? 
  [Snegur] Yes. Soon we will have our own. 
  [Mathil] Despite your historical links with Romania, in 
which 
Moldova was one of the provinces between the two world wars, 
your citizens ruled out unification with Romania at the first 
pluralist elections held in late February. Why? 
  [Snegur] The links are clear. We speak the same language and 
we used to be part of Romania. However, the Moldovan conscience 
has never disappeared. It created for itself a geographical and 
demographic framework. Within this framework, the population is 
65 percent Moldovan and 35 percent Ukrainian, Gagauz 
(Turkish-speaking orthodox), Bulgarian, etc. Today, all of this 
makes up a whole. During a recent national survey, 95 percent of 
the citizens said they supported independence. 
  [Mathil] Can this result be interpreted as a sign of 
Moldova's return to Russia? 
  [Snegur] I know that such an interpretation exists, but I am 
convinced that the Moldovan president and parliamentary majority 
will prove that it is a wrong interpretation. 
  [Mathil] It is claimed that you have yielded before the 
threat of a definitive secession of "the Russian-speaking 
Republic of Dnestr," where the Russian 14th Army is located, 
which alone is capable of imposing peace. Is the approach to 
Moscow the price of Russian mediation in this conflict? 
  [Snegur] Our relations with the democratic forces of Russia 
and President Yeltsin are completely satisfactory. Yeltsin 
himself has said on several occasions that he was in favor of a 
united Moldova. While we are fully aware that in Moscow there 
are currently forces that take a different turn than Yeltsin's, 
I hope that we will manage to maintain good relations. We 
therefore accept Russian mediation. 
  [Mathil] Do you also agree to having the Russian Army stay 
in 
Transdnestr? 
  [Snegur] No. The Army must be pulled out. Negotiations on 
this are currently being held. 
  [Mathil] Can your country be compared to Georgia, which has 
been torn apart by the secession of Abkhazia, where the Russian 
Army plays a similar role? 
  [Snegur] The situation is different. We managed to stop the 
conflict at the outset. The support of the population was 
greater, and so was the stability in the country. 
  [Mathil] Do you not think that your country, like Georgia or 
Tajikistan, is the target of Moscow's new doctrine toward 
regions which can be called "near neighbors?" Is this not an 
attempt to reconstruct a sort of "imperial" entity around Moscow? 
  [Snegur] There are obviously mutual interests, Russian 
interests in Moldova and Moldovan interests in Russia. It is 
normal after a long period of economic links and 
hypercentralization within the Soviet Union. 
  [Mathil] Solely economic links? 
  [Snegur] Yes. We are members of the CIS economic union, but 
not of its military structures. 
  [Mathil] Where do Russian ambitions end? 
  [Snegur] You should ask Moscow that question. 
  [Mathil] What do you think of Russian pressure, mostly in 
the 
energy sector, with regard to Ukraine, your large neighbor? 
  [Snegur] I would not like to comment on the relations 
between 
two sovereign states. On the energy front, Moldova is in a more 
favorable situation. 
  [Mathil] What do you think of the secessionist aspirations 
of 
Crimea? 
  [Snegur] I am categorically against any secession. The 
separatist evil must be stopped. 
  [Mathil] Are you afraid of Zhirinovskiy? 
  [Snegur] He should not be underestimated. Everyone from the 
former Soviet territory must be very vigilant and create the 
living conditions that prevent populism from taking root. 
  [Mathil] You and your government are former members of the 
old Communist Party. Moreover, the parties openly proclaiming 
their Communist heritage scored well in the recent elections. 
Is the reform program being threatened? 
  [Snegur] A return to Communism is neither possible nor 
acceptable. I am a reformer. The large majority of the new 
parliament was elected on a program of reform and privatization. 
  [Mathil] Starting Wednesday, Moldova will be the 12th 
central 
and eastern European country to have signed the Partnership for 
Peace. What do you expect from the West? 
  [Snegur] Help to enable us to restore both internal and 
external stability, and to help us find our place in Europe. 
  [Mathil] To join the Partnership, the Russians are asking 
for 
a "special status"... 
  [Snegur] I do not know about this issue of a "special 
status," but Russia is a major power. 
  [Mathil] Do you not think that Russia's current foreign 
policy reflects certain expansionist tendencies? 
  [Snegur] You are no doubt referring to certain peace 
missions 
to try and resolve conflicts in the old Soviet republics. 
Without Russia we could not find a solution to these conflicts.

<F P=106> [Quotation marks are as received] </F>
  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- The postponement of the 
CIS summit to mid-April has been received with great 
satisfaction in Kazakhstan. This was the aim which its 
leadership, together with the Russian Federation, had hoped for 
during previous weeks. 
  Kazakhstani Prime Minister Tershchenko, in an exclusive 
interview to correspondents of ITAR-TASS and KAZTAG said: "This 
demarche is explained by a necessity for a much more thorough 
preparation for the Moscow summit. It certainly demands 
additional time and effort. 
  The decisions made last year at the Ashgabat summit 
instilled 
hope for development of integrational processes in the CIS, but 
in reality implementation of the agreements reached on creation 
of an economic union is extremely slow. The economic situation 
in practically all CIS countries continues to deteriorate. In 
order to prevent the negative processes from acquiring a scale 
of catastrophe, a dynamic breakthrough is currently needed more 
than ever before toward a qualitatively new state of affairs in 
all main guidelines of our cooperation." 
  "That is why, Tereshchenko goes on to say, we in Kazakhstan 
think it is extremely important to discuss a number of top 
priority issues at the forthcoming summit. First, issues 
concerning acceleration of the creation of a common customs 
space and zones of free trade. It is also necessary to take 
urgent measures to commission the interstate bank, which was set 
up over a year ago but is still inoperative. For this end, in 
our opinion, it is necessary to set up a payment center for 
settling payments through this bank and later to reorganize it 
into a currency union on the basis of introduction of a 
supranational currency. This way will once and forever overcome 
the crisis of payments and normalize payment and credit 
relations between the CIS states." 
  "It is also time to set up a coordination organ of the CIS 
in 
Moscow. Without it, and this has been already proven in 
practice, neither agreements nor any other enforceable 
enactments will work as they are, and the economic union will 
remain, as before, on paper. This organ can be called a 
committee, a council or any other name, but it should by all 
means accumulate in it the highest intellectual potential and 
relevant research centers, including the CIS statistical board." 
  The Prime minister said in conclusion: "I submitted these 
and other suggestions in mid-February to the head of the Russian 
Federation Government, Chernomyrdin, who is chairman of the 
Council of the CIS Heads of State. As far as I know, the 
Russian Federation and a number of other countries are currently 
actively elaborating and developing them. Thus, it is quite 
possible to expect that the forthcoming April summit will be a 
real milestone on our difficult, dramatic, tense and yet hopeful 
way to a real and prosperous economic union."

  [Text] Russia and Kazakhstan are continuing their talks 
concerning the terms of leasing the launching site in Baykonur, 
and signing an agreement on military-technical cooperation. 
  A spokesman for the Russian Space Agency (RSA) told Interfax 
that a delegation led by the Kazakh Prime Minister, Sergey 
Tereshchenko, is arriving in Moscow on Wednesday with this aim 
in view. 
  According to the spokesman, "the delegation includes several 
groups of experts, each specializing in definite area of 
bilateral cooperation." 
  The talks in Moscow pose a third round of bilateral 
endeavors 
to work out documents to be signed by the presidents of the two 
countries in late March. 
  "This time the Kazakh delegation inclines to conclude the 
process of talks, and prepare all the documents for being 
signed, even if it has to stay in Moscow till the end of this 
month."

<F P=106> [Interview with Ramiz Rizayev, plenipotentiary </F>
representative in Russia, by Ilgar Gurbanov; place and date not 
given: "We Will Strengthen Relations with Russia"] 
  [Text] [Gurbanov] Ramiz Gasanovich, how do you rate the 
present sociopolitical situation in Azerbaijan? 
  [Rizayev] It is considerably more calm and stable in our 
republic today than it was a year ago, let us say. Naturally, 
the war which Armenia has now been waging against Azerbaijan for 
approximately six years has been and still is the chief 
barometer here. It must be emphasized that it is precisely 
Armenia that is fighting, not the mythical "Nagorno-Karabakh 
self-defense forces." Where has Karabakh's present tiny Armenian 
community gotten this tremendous military might, these tanks, 
missiles, and aircraft? Where has it gotten the fuel that powers 
the death-dealing war machines? The economic damage to the 
republic resulting from this war exceeds U.S.$4 billion. Today 
there are 1,000,200 [figure as published] refugees in 
Azerbaijan; the lot of these people who have been forced to 
leave their homes in order to escape annihilation is terrible. 
Old men, women, and children perish and die every day from 
cold, hunger, and disease. Ravaged by war, Azerbaijan cannot 
cope with this disaster, and the humanitarian aid, for which we 
are grateful to everyone who gives it, provides only poor 
support. 
  [Gurbanov] What can you say about the role of intermediaries 
in the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict? For example, about 
Russia's mediation mission.... 
  [Rizayev] We are grateful for any peacemaking efforts which 
might help to end the bloodshed, which neither the Azeris nor, I 
am sure, the Armenian people want. As for Russia's role in a 
peaceful settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, it 
must proceed from the premise that Russia's geopolitical and 
economic interests require stability on its southern borders. 
Approximately half a million Russians live in Azerbaijan, and 
they regard our republic as their homeland and share the burdens 
of the war equally with everyone. We therefore consider 
Russia's active participation and that country's objective 
position as very important factors in resolving this complex 
problem. Russia is taking peacemaking steps, and the activity 
of Vladimir Kazimirov, the Russian Federation president's 
special ambassador in the conflict zone, deserves particular 
mention. 
  We joined the CIS and signed the Collective Security Treaty, 
and we believe that this treaty must produce a considerably 
greater return than hitherto, because it is absurd when one CIS 
member, Armenia, wages an aggressive war against another, 
Azerbaijan. We also want more active participation by the 
United Nations, the CSCE, the Security Council, and, of course, 
Russia and other countries in resolving the Armenia-Azerbaijan 
conflict. 
  [Gurbanov] After everything that has happened, do we have 
any chance of hope in the "all-Caucasian home"...? 
  [Rizayev] This idea has arisen before in history. It still 
sounds only a fine metaphor, a dream. What question can there 
be of a common home when, alas, there is still no peace and 
accord in it? Let us first stop the bloodshed. 
  [Gurbanov] Mr. Ambassador, how does Azerbaijan perceive the 
cadre reshuffles in the Russian Government? 
  [Rizayev] We do not interfere in Russia's internal affairs. 
Naturally, we welcome the policy of democratic transformations 
in Russia. Russians are pinning their hopes on it, and we 
sincerely sympathize with them at this difficult time. One of 
the most important elements is the fact that the internal 
political situation in Russia largely determines the overall 
political and economic climate in the Commonwealth. 
  [Gurbanov] Is the need felt in the republic to adopt a 
statute on dual citizenship? Please tell me about the position 
of Russians and the Russian-speaking population in Azerbaijan, 
and also about the position of Azeris in Russia.... 
  [Rizayev] In Azerbaijan, as in other republics of the former 
USSR, the problem of dual citizenship is being discussed and 
constructive ideas about it are being accumulated. As regards 
Russian-speakers, here I would like to emphasize the following. 
The first Russian settlement in Azerbaijan appeared back in the 
time of Patriarch Nikon of Rus, at the end of the 17th century. 
Azerbaijan is their motherland. The good relations between 
Russians and Azeris have stood the test of time. The Slavs' 
Culture Center and the "Sodruzhestvo," "Azerbaijan-Russia," and 
"Russkaya Obshchina" societies are now operating in Baku. 
Newspapers and television and radio programs are put out in 
Russian, Russian schools and theaters are functioning.... 
  The war brings suffering not only to Azeris. Baku is gasping 
for breath and is unable to accommodate refugees from the 
territories occupied by the Armenian armed forces. There have 
been instances of unauthorized takeovers of both Azeris' and 
Russians' apartments, but the situation is being strictly 
monitored and obstacles are being placed in the way of 
lawlessness. I would like to speak about one other thing here. 
During very difficult times for Azerbaijan, particularly after 
the January 1990 bloodshed in Baku, part of the Russian-speaking 
population left the republic. But we are very glad that the 
majority of them have come back. 
  As regards the second part of your question, there are 
fellow 
countrymen of ours who have been living in Russia for long years 
and who have made a tremendous contribution to Russia's culture 
and economy. It is possible to name Aydyn Imamaliyev, Russia's 
chief trauma expert, and the artist Tair Salakhov. USSR 
People's Artiste Muslim Magomayev lives in Moscow; General K. 
Kerimov, who stood at the cradle of Soviet cosmonautics and was 
involved in the development of some highly interesting space 
projects, recently retired on pension. The list of such 
examples could be long. 
  But there is, unfortunately, something else. It so happens 
that Azeris are also involved in so-called mafia altercations. 
There is a lot of talk about the presence of Azeris at markets, 
about their behavior.... Here it is necessary to be able to 
separate the wheat from the chaff. When, for example, a Russian 
guy from Ryazan stands and sells meat at an exorbitant price, 
this seems not to be noticed. When "persons of Caucasian 
nationality" sell tomatoes, let us assume, for 1,000 rubles too 
much, from the Russians' viewpoint, indignation at once erupts. 
And yet the struggle must be waged not along ethnic lines, so 
to speak, but against the phenomenon of speculation, corruption, 
etc. Take the campaign mounted against Caucasians after the 
October events in Moscow -- very many offenses occurred. At any 
rate, we proceed from the premise that Azeris have no right, 
while living on Russian territory, to show disrespect for 
Russian laws, customs, and traditions or to forget about their 
national responsibility, because we represent our people far 
from our motherland. As regards criminal elements, all the 
severity of the law must be applied to them. 
  [Gurbanov] What do you think about the prospects for 
Azerbaijan's relations with Russia? 
  [Rizayev] Here we cannot manage without talking about the 
problems of the CIS. As is known, the Commonwealth emerged from 
the ruins of the Union, which was destroyed at a speed and with 
consequences which were disastrous for the peoples who populated 
it. Ties -- above all, economic ties which had just about 
"worked" for 70 years -- were severed overnight. All the 
burdens of such ultraradical, supposedly democratic "renewal" 
were also felt in full by the people of Azerbaijan. Let us take 
just one sector -- petroleum machine building. During the 
thousand-times cursed "era of stagnation" Azerbaijan produced 
approximately 80 percent of all the Union's oil-field and 
drilling equipment. After its breakup this indicator fell 
sharply -- which hit hard at oil extraction in Russia and, in 
the final analysis, also at the prosperity of Russians and the 
population of Azerbaijan. Today Azerbaijan's normal contacts 
with Russia are hampered by customs barriers and robbery on the 
railroads. This cannot be tolerated. 
  The policy pursued by the republic's former leaders 
virtually 
brought Azerbaijan to self-isolation -- isolation from many 
other countries, including Russia. We are now endeavoring to 
rectify this situation and have already largely done so. We are 
pursuing a policy of strengthening and expanding ties with 
Russia. 
  I am sure that both the Russian people and the Azeri people 
need this.

  [Text] President Geydar Aliyev received Mr. Russell 
(Cheetham), director of the World Bank's Europe and Asia 
Department, who is on an official visit to Azerbaijan. The 
guest will hold talks with the republic's leaders and 
representatives of several organizations during his visit. The 
objective of his visit is to familiarize himself with the 
present situation in Azerbaijan and discuss the World Bank's 
draft proposals on aid to the Republic. 
  President Aliyev warmly greeted his guest and informed him 
that he welcomes his visit. Aliyev stressed that he highly 
appreciates the World Bank's effort to cooperate with Azerbaijan 
and the steps it has taken in that direction. 
  Mr. Russell (Cheetham) said that the World Bank plans to 
invest in many economic areas in Azerbaijan. President Aliyev 
informed the guest that the problems he mentioned are vitally 
important. He asserted: Of course, Azerbaijan also has other 
problems. Under the existing conditions, we greatly need the 
World Bank's aid. The World Bank may rest assured that capital 
investments in Azerbaijan will be [word indistinct] for the 
future. 
  Mr. Russell (Cheetham) recalled that the World Bank has 
established relations with the former USSR republics during the 
past two or three years and stressed that it can also share its 
experience with Azerbaijan.

  [Text] Etibar Mamedov, leader of the Azerbaijani National 
Independence Party, held a news conference today for the 
Azerbaijani and foreign reporters. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Etibar Mamedov said that the news 
conference was devoted to the results of his visit to the United 
States. Speaking of his visit to the United States, Etibar 
Mamedov said that he had received an invitation last year to 
visit that country, but it was not until this year that the 
visit became possible. 
  He said that during his contacts at Congress, the State 
Department, and the Institute for International Strategic 
Studies his delegation met high-ranking officials and discussed 
a number of issues. He said his meetings with the U.S. National 
Security Council official responsible for Russia, the Caucasus, 
and Asia, as well as the active members of the Armenian lobby 
were particularly important. 
  He said that following his contacts he came to the 
conclusion 
that the Americans were not well informed about Azerbaijan and 
developments here, and that this situation was mostly due to the 
influence of the Armenian lobby in the United States. The 
Armenian lobby is organized and financed by Armenians living in 
the United States. Regrettably, one cannot say the same for the 
Azerbaijanis. Besides, there was no factual information on the 
occupation of Azerbaijani territory and the tens of thousands of 
refugees. 
  Speaking of the sociopolitical situation in the republic, 
Etibar Mamedov referred particularly to the latest discovery of 
illegally-held arms and to the discovery of a considerable 
amount of arms at the headquarters of the Azerbaijani People's 
Front. 
  He also expressed his views on the results of the meeting 
between the leaders of the Armenian and Azerbaijani parliaments 
on the peaceful resolution of the conflict. 
  At the end of the press conference, Etibar Mamedov also 
replied to reporters' questions.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: by Nikolay </F>
Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze stated that four 
UN member-states had agreed to send their troops to Abkhazia on 
a UN peacekeeping mission. He did not tell the Georgian 
parliament which particular countries were meant, but noted that 
their number might increase. 
  He told Interfax that the Georgian parliament's decision to 
dismiss the Abkhazian parliament was somewhat hasty and not 
quite justified from the tactical point of view. "However, in 
principle, it does not contradict the political context of the 
situation," he said. IF Note: The Georgian parliament ruled 
that pending parliamentary elections in Abkhazia the functions 
of the Abkhazian parliament will be performed by the Abkhazian 
Council of Ministers which will be granted the status of a 
temporarily evacuated body. The resolution also says that all 
the laws, adopted by the Abkhazian separatists, shall be 
considered invalid. 
  Chairman of the Abkhazian parliament Vladislav Ardzinba told 
Interfax that the talks on settling the Georgian-Abkhazian 
conflict would not be continued until the Georgian parliament 
annulled its resolution. He also said that the peace-making 
process was interrupted through Georgia's fault. 
  On Tuesday, the Abkhazian parliament circulated a statement 
which says that no further talks would be held on peaceful 
settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. 
  The Georgian parliament's decision to dismiss the Abkhazian 
parliament and to put the Abkhazian deputies on trial 
"illustrates that Georgia has put the stake on military solution 
again," says this document. 
  The Abkhazian parliament qualified the Georgian parliment's 
revolution as illegal, because Abkhazia, it said, is an 
independent state, not part of Georgia. 
  The statement also says that if the Georgian parliament 
reviewed its decision, the parliament of Abkhazia would continue 
the search for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. 
  Russia's Foreign Ministry expressed concern about this 
situation and about a real threat of armed clashes. 
  To quote Grigoriy Karasin, the head of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry's Department for Information and the Press, 
"Georgian-Abkhazian relations have deteriorated, producing a 
real threat of an armed conflict." At the final stage of the 
talks in New York, Georgia openly threatened to step back onto 
the path of war if Abkhazia did not unconditionally recognize 
Georgia's territorial integrity and agree to accept all Georgian 
refugees," he said. 
  He announced that Russia was making urgent steps to prevent 
armed clashes in Abkhazia and interruption of the talks. "It 
will also support UN or UN-apporved peacekeeping operations in 
Abkhazia, based, if necessary, on a Russian military 
contingent," said Karasin.

  [Text] Moscow, March 16 (SNARK)--"Georgia will never say 
"yes" to the Abkhazia's separation from Georgia. Abkhazians won 
the war, but it's the temporary victory", Valerian Advadze, 
Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador of Georgia to 
Russia, told yesterday March 15 at his press-conference in 
Moscow. 
  According to Valerian Advadze, the danger of separatism 
exists not only for Georgia but also for the other countries of 
the world. "The separatism in Abkhazia should be curbed, 
otherwise it will bring to civil wars". 
  So, the Russian Federation should support Georgia otherwise 
Russia will solve the same problems. 
  Mr. Advadze considers the visit of the Georgian leader 
Eduard Shevardnadze to the UN "very successful". The main aim 
of the visit was to convince world community of the necessity to 
introduce the peace-making forces into the zone of the conflict, 
to get the economical aid and political support of the 
Shevardnadze's course. 
  [Yerevan SNARK in English at 0916 in a similarly datelined 
report adds: "Abkhazia is the land of Georgia. It's necessary 
to recognize Abkhazia as a part of the Georgian state to prevent 
the possible bloodshed, Valerian Advadze, Extraordinary and 
Plenipotentiary Ambassador of Georgia to Russia, told in his 
exclusive interview to SNARK. 
  ["According to Mr. Ambassador, Abkhazia is guilty in 
torpedoing peace negotiations as she doesn't recognize the 
territorial integrity of Georgia. 
  ["'World speaks for Georgia and the Shevardnadze's visit to 
the UN confirms such attitude. There doesn't exist any state 
which recognizes the independence of Abkhazia. Abkhazians speak 
against the will of the whole world community', Mr. Advadze 
said."]

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Kozhanov: "Vladislav Ardzinba's Press </F>
Conference: Abkhazia Will Not Yield to Coercion"] 
  [Text] Abkhaz Supreme Soviet Chairman Vladislav Ardzinba's 
meeting with the press yesterday was awaited with particular 
interest. Questions about how the Abkhaz leader evaluates the 
decree adopted a few days ago by the Georgian parliament on the 
dissolution of the Abkhaz Supreme Soviet, and the extent to 
which this action will reflect on the progress of already 
difficult talks on a peaceful settlement to the Georgian-Abkhaz 
conflict, became the focus of attention immediately. 
  In this connection V. Ardzinba read out a statement from the 
republic Supreme Soviet conclusively emphasizing the total 
political and legal bankruptcy of the Georgian parliament's 
action. Sukhumi believes, moreover, that this action is a 
blatant provocation aimed at sabotaging the talks and returning 
to attempts at a forcible solution to the conflict. How else 
can it be interpreted, if the decree adopted in Tbilisi not only 
abolishes the parliament of a sovereign state but also provides 
for the criminal prosecution of the parliamentarians themselves? 
With just whom exactly does the Georgian side intend to 
continue talks after this? With an "abolished" authority? With 
"the defendants"? 
  And you know, the quest for a peaceful solution, which has 
been going on since last November, was close to success. As a 
result of three rounds of talks conducted under the UN aegis in 
Geneva and New York the sides had in point of fact reached 
agreement both on stationing peacemaking forces on the Inguri 
river and on restoring interstate relations. Nor did the Abkhaz 
side object to the return of Georgian refugees, with the 
exception of those who had participated directly in military 
operations against Abkhazia and carried out military and 
criminal acts on its territory. 
  It is not impossible that it was the close prospect of a 
peaceful solution that alarmed the Georgian authorities. After 
all, legal documents can hinder aggression. In this connection 
V. Ardzinba sharply criticized Shevardnadze's efforts to turn 
world public opinion against Abkhazia and his statements during 
a U.S. visit maliciously distorting the facts. Take, for 
instance, the blatant lies about genocide in the republic and 
about the number of Georgian refugees. Shevardnadze brazenly 
cited the figure of 300,000 as the number of Georgians who had 
allegedly fled from Abkhazia and repression at a time when the 
total number of Georgian inhabitants on the republic's territory 
never exceeded 220,000-240,000 people, a significant proportion 
of whom, incidentally, remain in the country even today. All 
the actions of Shevardnadze, who came to power as a result of a 
forcible coup, the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet chairman noted, bear 
the hallmarks of an international political adventurer. He 
already sees NATO "peacemaking" forces on the southern Russian 
border along the Psou river, with himself under their cover as 
the full-fledged master on Abkhaz soil. But adventures, as we 
know, end in failure sooner or later. The people of Abkhazia 
will never yield to coercion. They seek peace and tranquility, 
they thirst for a speedier revival of their war-torn and 
occupied country, and they are entitled to expect world 
understanding and support in this.

  [Text] Moscow, March 16 (SNARK) -- Shevardnadze is doing 
his best to use the UN peace-making forces to abolish the 
legislative authorities of Abkhazia, the Abkhazian [Supreme 
Soviet] Chairman Vladislav Ardzinba told the journalists at his 
press-conference March 15 in Moscow. 
  According to Mr. Chairman, the Abkhazian side is against the 
UN forces introduction into the territory of Abkhazia and offers 
to distribute the troops at the Georgian-Abkhazian border -- 
along the Ingury River.

  [Text] Tallinn, March 16 -- Good relations with Russia 
cannot in any way have unfavourable influence on Finland's 
relations with Estonia, Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho told a 
press conference ending his two-day visit to Estonia, on 
Wednesday [16 March], stressing that there existed no political 
problems between Estonia and Finland. 
  Aho stated that although Russian troop withdrawal from 
Estonia was primarily the matter of these two states it also 
concerned all other states of the region. 
  During his stay, Aho visited besides Tallinn also Tartu and 
Narva. Aho said that Finnish companies would participate at 
solving the environment problems of the Narva Power Plant, for 
these problems cause problems for all Baltic Sea states. He 
said also that after meeting the leaders of the Russian-speaking 
border-town Narva, he got an impression that there have not been 
any acute national problems in the region lately.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 16, BNS -- Chairman of the NATO 
Military Committee Field Marshal Sir Richard Vincent expects 
much from NATO's Partnership for Peace Program, which also 
Estonia has joined. 
  "I'm convinced that Estonia's and other East European 
countries' joining the program helps develop international 
political and economic relations and safeguards peace and 
security in Europe as a whole," Vincent said at a press 
conference in Tallinn today. 
  Commenting on Russia's bid to join the Partnership for Peace 
program, Vincent said it "can be regarded in a serious light." 
  "Some people are worried about NATO's possible cooperation 
with Russia and ask if this means a new Yalta agreement. I 
don't see it this way. Any nation that observes democratic 
principles and abides by the resolutions of international 
organizations is eligible for membership in the Partnership for 
Peace program," Vincent said. "I'm certain that this cooperation 
helps to make Europe a safer place." 
  Vincent didn't consider it likely that Russia would become a 
full member of NATO any time soon. "Joining NATO is not the same 
as joining the local tennis club," he said. "A new member will 
have to commit itself to certain very definite principles and 
rules that all NATO members recognize." 
  Vincent met yesterday and today with Maj. Gen. Aleksander 
Einseln, commander of the Estonian Defense Forces, Defense 
Minister Indrek Kannik, members of the parliamentary National 
Defense Commission, Foreign Ministry Chancellor Indrek Tarand, 
and Norwegian Ambassador to Estonia Brit Lovseth. 
  The NATO Military Committee chairman told BNS at the press 
conference the meetings brought to his attention Estonia's 
expectations with regard to the Partnership for Peace program 
and gave him a survey of the country's defense forces, of the 
plans for the Baltic peacekeeping battalion and the course of 
Russian troop withdrawal. Other topics touched upon in the 
meetings included the relations between military and civilian 
authorities in a democratic society and relevant legislation, as 
well as the attitude toward NATO of the Estonian public at large. 
  Einseln told the press "the field marshal brought good news 
to Estonia." 
  "Our cooperation with NATO has proceeded beyond talks," he 
said. "Soon we shall appoint an officer as Estonia's permanent 
representative at NATO." 
  Vincent is the first officer of so high a rank to visit 
Estonia. 
  "My first visit to your country gave me a better 
understanding of the changes taking place here," he said. "I 
kept myself informed of your struggles even before, also during 
World War II. I was five when the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was 
concluded and able to understand some things." 
  Vincent is accompanied by his wife, Jean, and five officers.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 15, BNS -- The Council of the Russian 
Community in Estonia sent to the parliament chairman the text of 
a Declaration on Compatriots' Rights, which may be interpreted 
as a veiled threat, Kalle Kulbok, chairman of the parliamentary 
royalist faction, told BNS. 
  In a letter addressed to parliament Speaker Ulo Nugis, the 
Council of the Russian Community put forward suggestions 
concerning the repatriation of ethnic Russians. The letter, 
signed by Yuri Kotenkov, included the text of the Declaration on 
Compatriots' Rights adopted Jan. 29 at the second world congress 
of Russian communities. 
  The declaration defines as "compatriots" all persons who 
permanently resided on the territory of the Soviet Union and 
held Soviet citizenship, if they regard Russian as their mother 
tongue. "Compatriots" have the inalienable right to a united 
fatherland. 
  The declaration regards as fatherland "the territory that is 
inherent in the statehood of the Russian nation and that 
legitimately belonged to the Russian Empire and the Soviet 
Union, including changes of border effected in accordance with 
the Constitutions of those states." The document maintains that 
compatriots cannot be declared to be aliens in any part of the 
territory; that neither collective nor individual deportation, 
or other similar measures, may be applied to them; and that 
compatriots cannot be declared to be stateless persons. 
  The congress of the Russian communities plans to set up a 
commission on compatriots' rights to check on observance of the 
declaration. The commission is authorized, among other things, 
to draw up lists of "officials, organizations and individuals 
responsible for acts committed against compatriots or Russian 
communities." 
  Kulbok said Royalists plan tomorrow to ask the interior 
minister for an explanation as to "how many persons there are in 
Estonia who disseminate this declaration and what's to become of 
Kotenkov who sent the declaration to the parliament."

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 16, BNS -- The Russian Community in 
Estonia proposed that the parliament pass some regulations to 
make leaving Estonia easier for those non-Estonians who have 
decided to resettle in the other former Soviet republics. 
  In a letter to parliament Speaker Ulo Nugis, the Council of 
the Russian Community suggests that persons registered with the 
Citizenship and Migration Department as resettlers be allowed to 
privatize their apartments without delay and either sell them 
freely or mortgage them to raise funds. 
  The council also proposes that one member of a repatriating 
family be allowed to cross the border freely and free of charge 
either during a five-year period or until the family completes 
building housing and resettling. 
  The problems involved in privatizing and selling their 
apartments and the lack of documents necessary for the 
unavoidable trips abroad in connection with repatriation are at 
present the major stumbling blocks for the non-Estonians who 
want to leave Estonia.

  [Text] Moscow, Mar 15, BNS -- Latvia and Russia completed 
the latest round of withdrawal talks Tuesday [15 March] in 
Moscow by initialing agreements on troop withdrawal, social 
protection of the withdrawing troops and social guarantees for 
retired military persons in the Baltic country. 
  Under the basic withdrawal treaty, Russia must get its 
remaining troops out by Aug. 31. 
  The agreement on the social protection of military 
pensioners 
refers to those who permanently lived in Latvia by January, 
1992, when Russia transferred the Soviet Army in the Baltics to 
its own jurisdiction. 
  The retired military persons are naturalized as Latvian 
citizens in compliance with the Latvian law. 
  The war pensioners are granted the status of permanent 
residents and the property use rights. 
  The delegations also coordinated several paragraphs in the 
agreement on the Russian radar at Skrunda, Latvia. 
  Firstly, Latvia lets Russia operate the radar station for 
four years and then dismantle it in 18 months. 
  Secondly, Latvia allows Russia to keep 500 military persons 
and 200 civil persons to service the installation. The Latvians 
themselves will perform the outer guarding of the station. 
  Thirdly, the delegations decided that the early-warning 
anti-missile radar is "a Russian military installation under 
civil control." Consequently, Skrunda won't be considered a 
Russian military base. 
  The parties still disagree on the amount of rent for the 
radar's functioning. Russia's offer of 2 million USD per year 
does not satisfy Latvia. 
  Russia has said it wants to sign the entire package of 
documents simultaneously. 
  The conclusive summit of the presidents, Boris Yeltsin and 
Guntis Ulmanis, could take place already in the beginning of 
April, chief Russian delegate Sergei Zotov told reporters today. 
  The completed round of talks was already the 13th since the 
beginning of interstate consultations in 1992, the Interfax news 
agency reported Monday. 
  According to estimates, around 12,000 Russian military 
persons are still stationed in Latvia and another 3,000 in the 
Baltic country of Estonia. Lithuania has completely parted with 
the former Soviet Army.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 16, BNS -- The Latvian parliament's 
Latvia's Way faction maintains that Russia will be bind to stick 
to Aug. 31 as the troop pullout deadline after the initialing of 
draft agreements, its Deputy Chairman Indulis Berzins told BNS 
Wednesday [16 March]. 
  The faction won't take any decisions on the ratification of 
the draft agreement before all deputies acquaint themselves with 
the text of the documents, Berzins said. 
  The ratification of the agreements depends on whether 
President Guntis Ulmanis will sign them and on the course of 
events in Russia, Berzins noted. 
  Concord for Latvia's Edvins Kide said his faction favored 
the 
agreements because "if there is no agreement there is no 
instrument to press on Russia if it does not withdraw its 
troops." 
  The Homeland and Freedom faction, however, claims that the 
government delegation violated the law on ratification of 
interstate agreements, faction head Maris Grinblats told 
reporters. 
  The faction proposes to organize a public opinion poll May 
29 
on the functioning of the former Soviet radar installation at 
Skrunda. The date coincides with the local government elections. 
  The poll should include only one question: "Do you agree to 
the functioning of the Skrunda radar after Aug. 31?" 
  The factions of the Farmers Union, the Democratic Party and 
the Christian Democratic Union Party have not discussed the 
withdrawal agreement yet.

<F P=106> [Article by Janis Kulmanis: "Latvia Submits a Note to the </F>
United States"] 
  [Text] Riga, 8 Mar -- On Monday [7 March], Latvian 
Ambassador to the United States Ojars Kalnins submitted a note 
from the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the U.S. 
Department of State, with the aim of obtaining an explanation of 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's statement before a 
Senate subcommittee on 2 March regarding Latvia. This was 
reported by the press center of the Latvian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed its 
incomprehension of W. Christopher's statement that "there are 
about one million Russians in Latvia who are deprived of voting 
rights," because, in fact, 278,087 out of 722,468 Russians 
residing in Latvia are citizens of the Latvian Republic. 
  The chief U.S. diplomat pointed out twice that the presence 
of the Russian Army at the Skrunda radar base is essential. 
  The note states that W. Christopher has accepted Russia's 
rights "to stimulate the Latvians to broaden their circle of 
citizens and to grant voting rights to Russians who want to live 
in Latvia." The Latvian Foreign Affairs Ministry is alarmed 
that Russia might interpret these remarks as acceptance of 
Russian attempts to dictate Latvian citizenship and 
naturalization policy. In the end, the note says that 
Christopher's remarks, unless they are explained, can be 
tendentiously distorted in Latvia as well as in Russia, and this 
could seriously interfere with the efforts of the Latvian 
Government to resolve important issues related to citizenship, 
Russian military withdrawal, and the status of the Skrunda radar 
station. 
  The note expresses amazement over the fact that the U.S. 
secretary of state did not mention any of the progress which has 
been achieved in Latvia in working out a citizenship law in line 
with international standards, as well as the fact that one third 
of ethnic Russians in Latvia are already Latvian citizens. The 
Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has proposed a meeting of 
diplomats from both countries.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 16, BNS -- Latvia has to reconcile itself 
with the anticipated participation of Russia in the NATO's 
Partnership for Peace program which is designed for all East 
European countries, MP Indulis Berzins told BNS Wednesday [16 
March]. 
  Latvia will continue its path to the full integration into 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization because it is the only 
organization capable of extending security guarantees in the 
conditions of foreign jeopardy, Berzins said. 
  NATO extension rests with NATO itself, Berzins noted. 
  Berzins is deputy head of the majority Latvia's Way faction 
and member of the parliament's Foreign Affairs' Committee.

<F P=106> [Report by Aldona Svirbutaviciute: "Investigator for </F>
Special Cases -- Against the Wind?"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, K. Milkeraitis, investigator for 
particularly important cases at the Prosecutor General's Office 
Investigating Department, made a public statement in the Seimas 
[parliament]. 
  The essence of his statement state hindrances in 
investigating the criminal case on the appropriation of state 
property and the activities of foreign special services. The 
key reason that forced investigator K. Milkeraitis to appeal to 
the public was the attempt to impair the investigation and help 
the culprits evade criminal responsibility. 
  According to the investigator, the collected material leaves 
no doubt that the companies "Litcommerz GmbH" (Commercial 
Director A. Klimaitis [accused of working for the KGB] ) and 
"Baltica-Union" (President A. Bakaitis) were set up with the aim 
of appropriating state property. 
  "Both economic entities were organized by the Soviet KGB, 
while transforming them into commercial enterprises. Employees 
of this foreign special service came to work under their cover 
enjoying the status of the `active reserve'," reads K. 
Milkeraitis' statement. 
  According to Seimas Deputy A. Endriukaitis, the fact that 
the 
case may disclose the interests of the ruling [Labor Democratic] 
party is responsible for attempts to discontinue it. 
  K. Milkeraitis held a press conference because on 8 March he 
had to pass this case over to the leadership of the Prosecutor 
General's Office together with documentation and even material 
evidence. What if the latter does not exist? 
  Asked by TIESA whether he had pondered over his future as a 
prosecutor for special cases after this press conference, K. 
Milkeraitis replied: "I have not thought about my future. 
Today, I must submit the case, composed of 15 files, with all 
evidence to the leadership. The investigation is still 
continuing. True, it was suspended during my illness. It has 
been resumed but only until a fixed date." 
  According to the investigator, the term "political and 
criminal" would be too mild for this case.

  [Text] Moscow, 17 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- Early this morning an 
armed group of persons in military uniform seized the building 
of the town administration in Vladivostok. There is effectively 
no legitimite rule in the town, says a cable from the deputy 
head of administration of the town, received by ITAR-TASS. 
  The Vladivostok mayor's office is blockaded by OMON [Special 
Purpose Militia Detachment] men who have been brought in by 
Lebedinets, vice governor of Maritime Kray. They are not 
allowing lawyer Ulitskiy to see the mayor, although Mayor Viktor 
Cherepkov has been detained, a report from the mayor's office of 
the town points out. The fact that yesterday the mayor had a 
serious heart attack is being ignored, and doctors who arrived 
in an ambulance have told him to stay in bed and have forbidden 
him being questioned.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Larisa Beloyvan and Eduard </F>
Popov] 
  [Text] Vladovostok March 17 TASS -- Unrest has been 
sweeping Russia's Far Eastern city of Vladivostok for the second 
consecutive day. On Wednesday, armed riot police stormed the 
mayor's office and told Mayor Viktor Cherepkov and his closest 
aides they were dismissed from office. First Deputy Mayor 
Vladimir Gilgenberg, who put up resistance, was literally 
carried out of the building by police. 
  This was the second armed invasion of the city 
administration 
building. The first occupation occurred on the night from 
February 12-13, and was prompted, according to an official 
version, by the need to question Cherepkov on receiving a bribe 
from a certain Volkov. The mayor then remained at power thanks 
to public support. 
  On Wednesday, the Maritime territorial administration issued 
an order to topple Cherepkov, citing the documents supplied by 
the city prosecutor which say criminal proceedings are being 
established against Cherepkov under Article 170 (Part 3) of the 
Russian Criminal Code (bribe taking). 
  Territorial administration members Konstantin Tolstosheyn 
and 
Vasiliy Terekhov have been named acting mayor and his deputy. 
They had been Cherepkov's rivals in the mayor's elections, but 
flopped, scoring 1.5 percent votes between them. 
  Supporters of the toppled mayor, including a group of voters 
who nominated him to the territorial duma, have announced that 
Cherepkov's toppling was an act of open arbitrariness and a 
gross violation of human rights. They said they would hold acts 
of protest, up to fasting at the territorial administration 
building. 
  The first meeting of protest was held in Vladivostok on 
Thursday night.

  [Text] Moscow, March 17 KYODO -- Russian Security Ministry 
troops on Wednesday [16 March] night forcefully took away the 
former mayor of Vladivostok from his office in the municipal 
government building, Russian prosecutors said Thursday. 
  The ex-mayor Viktor Cherepkov was dismissed for alleged 
bribery, but had rejected to leave the office. 
  ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY earlier reported that Security 
Ministry 
troops had detained the mayor after taking over his office. 
  Cherepkov was indicted last month on a charge of taking a 3 
million ruble payoff and an Omega wristwatch in exchange for 
providing favors to a man who was planning to increase business 
interests in the port city, said the prosecutors for the Russian 
Far East Maritime Region. 
  Cherepkov has persistently denied the charge of wrongdoing. 
  Following the indictment, he was stripped of his position 
until a Russian court hands down a ruling on the case. 
  During the one-month period, Cherepkov has defied the orders 
of a local court and prosecutors to vacate his office, and the 
purpose of the raid was to force him out, the prosecutors said. 
  The troops also dispersed many of Cherepkov's supporters who 
had gathered at the municipal government building, apparently 
fearing that security forces might try to break in.

  [Text] A group of prominent public and political leaders 
announced the creation of a new movement in Moscow today. It is 
called Accord for the Sake of Russia [Soglsiye vo imiya Rossii]. 
  Its main tasks are to avert the final disintegration of the 
country, to halt the destruction of production capabilities, to 
protect the market and the national capital, and to prevent 
unemployment and hunger, allowing every citizen of the country 
to live at a proper subsistence level and in a dignified way. 
  Dmitriy Pinsker, our parliamentary correspondent, has asked 
the authors of today's appeal to the citizens of Russia to 
explain what the new movement is about. 
  [Begin Pinsker recording] The future belongs to this 
movement 
-- it is a force which consolidates all patriotic parties and 
associations, Anatoliy Lukyanov told a correspondent from Ekho 
Moskvy. He stressed that he had taken part in the drafting of 
the appeal, but does not see any necessity as yet to sign it. 
Mikhail Lapshin, the leader of the Agrarian Party, thinks that 
the creation of the Accord for the Sake of Russia is not a step 
towards confrontation with the president but, on the contrary, a 
desire to achieve civic accord. 
  It should be noted that Vasiliy Lipitskiy, whose name is 
given as one of the founders, told an Ekho Moskvy correspondent 
that it was the first time he heard of this movement, never mind 
his participation in it. [end recording] 
  Let me add that today's appeal to the citizens of Russia has 
been signed by Valeriy Zorkin, Gennadiy Zyuganov, Sergey 
Baburin, Aleksandr Prokhanov, Aleksandr Tsypko, Nikita 
Mikhalkov, and a number of others.

  [Text] Andrey Kozyrev, minister for foreign affairs of the 
Russian Federation, yesterday afternoon visited the Pacific 
Fleet's large antisubmarine ship, Admiral Panteleyev. 
Accompanied by Vice Admiral Igor Khmelnov, first deputy 
commander of the Pacific Fleet, and Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, head 
of the Maritime Kray administration, the guest toured the ship 
and visited the navigation bridge. 
  Subsequently, the minister of foreign affairs went down to 
the ship's wardroom where officers and crew waited for him. In 
a short talk, the minister noted that the Russian Army and the 
fleet, like the country, are experiencing a difficult time. 
However, this is not the first time that this has happened in 
Russia and that is why the Navy must live through it 
appropriately; skillfully defend the fatherland; serve the 
Constitution; and carry out the president's orders. The Pacific 
Fleet is a great fleet and we will strengthen it, and we do not 
intend to divide the other fleets. 
  From the ship, Andrey Kozyrev, minister for foreign affairs, 
set out for Vladivostok Airport where he met Warren Christopher, 
U.S. secretary of state, who had arrived for talks. After the 
talks, a short briefing was held for Russian and foreign 
journalists.

  [Text] Staff at Kursk nuclear power station are threatening 
to go on hunger strike, boycott the oblast Duma elections, and 
cut off the current to the power lines and so cause problems in 
the unified power grid unless debts are paid off. The nuclear 
power industry workers are demanding that around 86 billion 
rubles owed for electricity already supplied and three-month 
wage arrears are paid. These demands have been sent to the 
Russian Government by a joint decision of the station's 
management board and labor collective councils. The deadline 
set for meeting these demands is 10 March. But even right now 
the total capacity of the station's four power units is down by 
50 percent. Nuclear fuel reserves at the Kursk nuclear power 
station are running out. Suppliers are unwilling to deliver 
without payment. For the time being Kursk power station workers 
are working without pay. The station's safe and reliable 
operation is nonetheless guaranteed. Nuclear energy, even when 
used for peaceful purposes, must not be tinkered with. But 
staff are ready to shut down the station.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Oliynik: "Junior Officer Shortage.... </F>
Moscow Military District Military Council Examines State of 
Military Discipline in District"] 
  [Text] A report at the military council meeting was 
delivered by Lieutenant General Leonid Zolotov, the district's 
chief of staff. The figures and facts which he quoted can 
hardly be called reassuring. Over the past two years the number 
of people sentenced in the district for various military crimes 
has increased by 13 percent. Over the past year 82 servicemen 
have been killed, along with another 19 in the first two months 
of this year. Twenty-five of them died while not on duty, and 
another 18 died in car crashes in personal transport. 
  Nor has there been any reduction in the number of those who 
have embarked on the path of embezzling military property, 
weapons, and munitions. Last year 20 firearms and more than 
5,000 rounds of ammunition -- most of which have not been 
recovered -- were stolen. 
  The district chief of staff noted that the main pernicious 
influences on the state of military discipline and law and order 
include the acute shortage of platoon and company commanders and 
their deputy commanders for work with the personnel. The 
district is currently 50 percent short of these categories of 
junior officers, and in certain units this figure is 
considerably higher. At the same time more than 500 mostly more 
senior officers have been in uniform for a long time now and are 
to all intents and purposes dealing with matters far removed 
from the service. 
  There are also problems with the discipline of contract 
servicemen. The command has been forced to cancel the contracts 
of 1,266 of the 7,360 soldiers and warrant officers serving in 
district units under contract. The reasons for this are 
indiscipline and low moral qualities. Colonel General Leontiy 
Kuznetsov, commander of the Moscow Military District, called on 
commanders and oblast military commissariat workers to be more 
discriminating in their selection of people for contract service.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Yuriy Vakhrin: "They Have Elected </F>
Duma Deputies and Ruined Referendum"] 
  [Text] Kostroma -- All 15 deputies' seats in the Kostroma 
Oblast Duma have been filled as a result of the elections held 
last Sunday. The present "generals" of executive power -- two 
deputy governors, three heads of rural rayon administrations, 
and other officials -- have gotten through in single formation. 
  The level of Kostroma voters' activeness was as a whole 
relatively high: According to preliminary figures at least 38 
percent of voters took part in voting. It is true that the city 
inhabitants demonstrated no particular eagerness to make use of 
their legal right. That is why there was no referendum in 
Kostroma to approve the statute on local self-management. 
Incidentally, this statute, submitted by the mayor of Kostroma, 
Federation Council Deputy Boris korobov, markedly expanded the 
rights of the representative municipal organ compared with what 
was determined by the Russian president's edicts. 
  To determine the fate of this document, at least half of the 
voters should have gone to the polling stations.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Kuchin; from the "Pacific Ocean" Program] </F>
  [Text] Sergey Turkov, VESTI's correspondent for the 
Kamchatka Oblast, published an article which will surely 
interest all fishermen and naval seamen in the Far East basin. 
The seine fishing vessel Kamsuda III, belonging to a private 
company of the same name, was fishing for cod in the area of 
Asacha Bay, southeast of Kamchatka. About midday, the echo 
sounder indicated a large school of cod on an isobath of two 
hundred meters 10 miles from shore. It was decided to set the 
pair of seine. When the sweep was completed and retrieval of 
the half-kilometer seine lines began, something puzzling 
happened. The vessel stopped, then slowly began to reverse 
although the engines were on slow forward. At first it was 
thought the bottom had been snagged. However, the cables became 
taut, one of them snapping and the second beginning to feed out 
from the hold. The ship began to list to starboard. 
  The seamen on deck realized that something was not right and 
elected to seek shelter behind the deck structures out of harm's 
way. The captain could in no way understand the reason for what 
was going on, because in his many years of experience nothing 
like this had ever happened. All this occurred in the space of 
minutes. The conning tower of a nuclear-powered submarine 
emerged from the water literally a few meters from the vessel 
and just starboard of the seiner's stern, while the stern 
rudders of the submarine were port of the seiner's bow. That 
is, the submarine was directly beneath the vessel. 
  While the stunned crew was gathering its wits, the submarine 
disappeared in a northerly direction, dragging off with it the 
pair of seine and two and a half kilometers of cable, leaving 
the trawler without fishing gear or cable. The damage caused by 
the nuclear submarine was approximately 20 million rubles, not 
taking into account lost profits and valuable fishing days. The 
seiner was fishing in an authorized area, and there was no 
advice on any closure of the area. The captain immediately 
reported the incident to the expedition chief aboard the BMRT 
[large refrigerated fishing trawler] Tselihar and headed for 
port. Of course, there was nothing left to fish with. 
  On arriving in port, the sailor who was handling the cable 
in 
the hold and miraculously remained alive after the capture of 
the submarine, immediately signed off the vessel. When the 
VESTI correspondent arrived aboard the vessel he encountered 
Captain Second Rank Gritsay, Kamchatka Naval Flotilla's 
assistant flag navigation officer. Gritsay calmed the 
correspondent by saying nothing happened, and that the vessel 
simply snagged bottom; none of this was connected with any 
submarines. However, the submarine--which had returned to 
port--was supposedly merely carrying out its combat mission. 
When the author of this report expressed his interest as to why 
such a high-ranking military chief was aboard such a humble 
seiner, the captain second class replied he was simply visiting 
an old friend. Meanwhile, the seiner's captain involved in the 
incident was intensely writing explanatory notes and making 
extracts from the ship's logs. 
  I will add that this is the second occasion in which a 
submarine was caught off Kamchatka. In 1976 the medium 
refrigerated fishing trawler Som, belonging to the 
Kamchatrybkolkhozobyedineniye fishing fleet 
department--presently called the Akros Company-- caught a 
submarine in an authorized fishing area.

  [Text] Moscow March 16 TASS -- The State Duma adopted a 
resolution on Wednesday [16 March] on Boris Yeltsin's message to 
parliament "On Strengthening Russian Statehood." 
  Under the resolution, the most important task of the State 
Duma is to ensure legislative support for the development of the 
Russian Federation in order to create an integral and stable 
democratic country with due respect for human rights, efficient 
economy, and which persistently realises principles of federal 
relations and ensures the rights of nations and nationalities. 
  The government of the Russian Federation is entrusted to 
work 
out measures for overcoming the socio-economic crisis in the 
country. Lawmakers pointed out that the State Duma should 
continue its work to prevent further decline in Russia's 
industry and agriculture and create an efficient 
socially-oriented system of the industrial complex aimed at the 
constructive revival of the industrial and agricultural 
potential. 
  In accordance with main provisions of the presidential 
message and sharing his concern over the situation in the 
country and stemming from lawmakers' commitments and electors' 
wishes, the State Duma intends to prepare and work out the most 
important laws aimed at taking the country out of crisis and 
stabilising its economy, carrying out the reform of budgetary, 
taxation, credit and financial system and protecting domestic 
manufacturers. 
  Priority should be given to federal constitutional laws, 
federal laws in the sphere of franchise and civil rights, the 
right to work and housing, judicial reform and human rights. 
  Proceeding from the fact that the insolvency crisis and 
overdue wages pose a special threat, fraught with serious social 
upheaval, the State Duma decided to turn to the president and 
the government with a proposal that this problem be resolved 
without delay and in the shortest possible time.

  [Text] Moscow March 16 TASS -- The State Duma has endorsed 
a procedure for future parliamentary hearings. 
  At its plenary meeting on Wednesday [16 March], the Duma 
directed appropriate committees to arrange for hearings on the 
Partnership-for-Peace documents, which had been adopted at a 
session of the North Atlantic Council in January 1994, on 
matters concerning the implementation of the START I Treaty and 
its realisation problems, an analysis of the status and problems 
of the state border of the Russian Federation, and on the 
Russia's participation in international agreements on the 
elimination of chemical weapons. 
  The Duma will also hold hearings to consider "the results of 
the privatisation of state-run and municipal enterprises of the 
Russian Federation in 1992-1993" and a relevant state programme, 
on structural, science and technology policy, and a concept of 
the Russian Federation's transition to a steady development 
model.

  [Text] Moscow March 16 TASS -- The Russian General 
Prosecutor's Office has received more than 90 reports about 
violations of the Election Law by local bodies of state 
authority in Russian regions, the State Duma was told today. 
Such violations were registered in 23 component parts of the 
federation. The worst was that citizens, servicemen in 
particular, were not allowed to run for seats in local bodies of 
power. 
  The Russian State Duma reaffirmed on Wednesday [16 March] 
its 
intention to pass a bill on guarantees of voters' rights during 
elections to local government. The president as the guarantor 
of the Constitution is recommended to take measures to avert 
such violations.

  [Text] Moscow March 16 TASS -- The lower house of the 
Russian parliament approved in the first reading a federal draft 
law "On the order of involving military and civil personnel of 
the Russian Federation in operations for the maintenance or 
restoration of international peace and security and other kinds 
of peace-keeping activities." 
  Russian deputy defence minister, Georgiy Kondratyev, 
addressed lawmakers today, saying that over 16,000 Russian 
servicemen are performing their duties in hot beds of tension on 
our planet in the framework of a peace-keeping mission. 
  Lawmakers took into account appeals made by Russian Defence 
Ministry officials who pointed out that the law was a matter of 
vital importance. It was pointed out that Russia's 
participation in peace-keeping activities, connected with 
continuing instability in areas adjoining Russia's territory, 
and Russia's membership in the U.N. make it necessary to create 
a corresponding legal basis which does not exist at present. 
  The law, adopted in the first reading, determines the order, 
rights and duties of bodies of state power when resolving 
matters of sending military or civil contingents on 
peace-keeping missions outside the Russian federation.

  [Text] State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin was the most 
influential figure in the Russian parliament's lower chamber. 
His rating was 7.1 on a ten-point scale (slightly down from 8.0 
points last January), experts of the Russian Federation's 
Political Research Center announced. 
  Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov ranks second -- 6.1 
points 
compared to 5.7 points in January. 
  Third comes Vladimir Isakov, leader of the Agrarian Party -- 
5.8 points compared to 3.7 in January. 
  Political scientists believe that the communists' and 
agrarians' strong position is due to the success of the 
political amnesty granted to the 1991 coup leaders and the 
organizers of the hardline revolt last October, initiated by 
them. 
  Leader of the Liberal Democratic Party Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
ranks fourth -- 5.5 points compared to 6.9 last January. 
Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar went down from second place 
in January (6.4 points) to fifth -- 4.9 points. 
  Observers also point to a noticeable success of former 
minister of foreign economic relations Sergey Glazyev, who 
represents the Democratic Party of Russia. He ranked sixth in 
February, scoring 4.8 points (compared to 3.2 points in 
January). Experts explain his success by the fact that Glazyev 
had advanced his own economic program.

rubric: "New Group Created in State Duma"] 
  [Text] Valeriy Borshchev, chairman of the Russian 
Christian Democratic Union [RCDU], announced yesterday the 
creation in the State Duma of a new deputy group. 
  Joining the RCDU group today are six people, mainly from the 
Yabloko faction. It also has members of Russia's Choice, 
however, in particular Gleb Yakunin and Vitaliy Savitskiy. 
According to Borshchev, the RCDU group is not trying in any 
manner to effect a split in the democratic forces of the Duma. 
On the contrary, it will be trying to bring closer together the 
positions of Yabloko, Russia's Choice, and the Union of 12 
December in a bid to create a single reformist bloc. A platform 
for such an association, Borshchev thinks, could be the results 
of voting on the political amnesty issue. KURANTY has already 
reported that the amnesty was not supported by all three 
factions.

  [Text] Moscow, 16 Mar -- The agreement signed by the 
defense ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan and the 
Nagorno-Karabakh military representative with the mediation of 
the Russian defense minister in Moscow on 18 February does not 
infringe the rights and dignity of any state and should be 
observed. This was stated by Army General Pavel Grachev, chief 
of the Russian military department, at a meeting with 
journalists. He is not satisfied with how the agreement is 
being observed as "none of the sides is totally fulfilling the 
obligations undertaken." "Unfortunately, percentage-wise the 
Azerbaijani side is the one least fulfilling the agreement," 
Pavel Grachev noted. 
  The leadership of Azerbaijan, in the minister's words, is 
categorically against bringing troops into the conflict region, 
which would make it possible to withdraw the troops of both 
sides some 20-30 km from where they are deployed. Grachev 
called this circumstance "a stumbling block." 
  The Russian defense minister informed journalists that on 15 
March he refused to meet the heads of the military departments 
of Armenia and Azerbaijan, who arrived in Moscow, and stated 
that he does not intend to meet them until they comply with the 
agreement which had been signed with his participation.

  [Text] Moscow, 16 March -- Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev intends on 17 and 18 March to visit military formations 
and units in Kaliningrad oblast. He announced this today at a 
meeting with journalists. 
  The head of the country's defense department denied reports 
by some of the foreign mass media that he had not left for 
Leningrad military district because of extreme social tension in 
society requiring, it is claimed, the presence in Moscow of a 
"strong hand." He also said that the reports that troops in 
Moscow military district had allegedly been put on an enhanced 
readiness footing were false. 
  At the ITAR-TASS correspondent's request Pavel Grachev 
explained that he is one of those in possession of a so-called 
nuclear button. One button is with the Russian President, who is 
at present in Sochi; the second button is with himself; and the 
third is with the Chief of the General Staff, who has gone to 
France on a working visit. Pavel Grachev emphasized that, 
although the president has in his possession a control system 
for the strategic nuclear forces in the form of a "small nuclear 
case," there should always be one of the military leaders in 
Moscow at the permanent control point. 
  "This evening, the Chief of the General Staff is returning 
from Paris, and tomorrow I shall be leaving for Kaliningrad in 
accordance with the plan for visiting troops", Pavel Grachev 
stated in conclusion.

  [Text] Moscow, 16 Mar 16 TASS -- Shifting of targets of 
Russia's nuclear missiles does no damage to security of the 
Russian Federation and other states but is a manifestation of 
confidence and strengthening of strategic stability, Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told ITAR-TASS here today. 
  The defense minister was commenting on Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin's recent order assigning the Defense Ministry 
before May 30 "to take measures aimed at organizing the everyday 
activities of the strategic nuclear forces with non-targeted 
missiles". 
  Pavel Grachev added that the issue on the mutual

States was raised for the first time at a meeting of the two 
presidents in Vancouver last year. In January this year Boris 
Yeltsin and Bill Clinton confirmed in the Moscow Declaration 
that they would give the appropriate instructions to their 
defense ministries. 
  According to the Russian defense minister, Britain also 
joined this initiative. 
  Pavel Grachev believes that terms of implementing this 
decision will be determined by organizational and technical 
possibilities, and are specific for each kind of strategic 
weapons.

<F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Izgarshev: "Who Has Nuclear Buttons"] </F>
  [Text] "Will there be a third way?" "What will happen to 
the Russian Army if the Duma approves the Ministry of Finance's 
version of the defense budget?" "With whom is it easier for the 
defense minister to deal -- his counterparts from remote foreign 
parts or from nearby foreign parts? "Did the supreme commander 
take the nuclear button with him to Sochi?..." 
  Russian and foreign journalists put an extremely large 
number 
of questions to Defense Minister Pavel Grachev at yesterday's 
press conference. Perhaps the fact that it is three months 
since the minister met with the press had an effect, but most 
likely the keenness of the questions was caused by the acute 
nature of the moment our Russia is living through now. 
  Everything taking place in society is visibly reflected in 
the life of the troops. A tendency has emerged toward the 
normalization of the crime situation in the troops (the number 
of some types of gross law violations was reduced from 25 to 40 
percent last year). As a whole, the fall and winter draft 
proceeded in a better and more organized manner. Pavel Grachev 
honestly and frankly described all of the Army's "sores" and the 
main tasks that the troops are resolving. 
  Regarding the putsch the minister put it like this: Their 
time has passed. We must work and do our job or we shall all be 
left without bread. As for nuclear buttons, we have three of 
them. One of the buttons "went" with the president to Sochi. 
Grachev has the second, Chief of General Staff Mikhail 
Kolesnikov has the third, but since he is on a visit to France 
the minister has been left with the button and that is why his 
previously announced visit to the Leningrad Military District 
was deferred. 
  In conclusion, I report to readers that it is a long time 
since the military from PRAVDA were invited to the Defense 
Ministry. Yesterday, our correspondent was there for the first 
time after a lengthy "vacation." We shall consider relations 
restored.

<F P=106> [Report by Ilya Bulavinov: "Pavel Grachev's Press </F>
Conference. The Military Are Concerned by the Economy, Not by 
Politics"] 
  [Excerpt] None of the journalists who came yesterday to 
the defense minister's press conference knew for sure what had 
prompted the event. Representatives of the mass media asked 
Pavel Grachev lots of questions concerning the problems of the 
Armed Forces that they were interested in before the purpose of 
the press conference was clarified. Mr. Grachev denied rumors 
that the Army had been put on alert and that some of his actions 
were allegedly politically motivated. 
  In the view of many observers, one of the reasons for the 
rumors was the postponement of Pavel Grachev's announced visit 
to the Leningrad Military District. Some time ago the defense 
minister said that he would stay in Moscow as long as the 
president and the General Staff chief are away from the capital 
in order to exercise day-to-day command and control of the 
strategic nuclear forces. In the press conference, Pavel 
Grachev flatly denied any political bottom line of this 
decision, saying only that such is normal practice and that one 
of the three must always remain in Moscow. Today, when General 
Staff Chief Mikhail Kolesnikov is returning from France, the 
defense minister will leave for Kaliningrad. 
  Pavel Grachev also denied rumors that there are units in the 
Moscow Military District that had been put on alert. He 
reaffirmed that the Army does not interfere in the political 
struggle and it is not going to do so, but that it will act 
decisively if it senses the threat of civil war. [passage

<F P=106> [Grachev remarks are recorded; from the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Russia's Defense Minister Pavel Grachev held a news 
conference in Moscow today at which he spoke of the problems of 
organizational development in the Russian Army. According to 
him, the Army today cannot be provided with new military 
equipment as needed because defense enterprises are in a 
catastrophic state, i.e, in a state of forced conversion. The 
Ministry of Defense owes them a huge sum of money. 
  However, Pavel Grachev stated publicly for the first time 
that the Army is being financed at such a low level that there 
would be a complete breakdown if it is any lower. 
  [Grachev] That is what the budget which, unfortunately, the 
Ministry of Finance is offering us, could lead to; the Ministry 
of Finance, which, you see, knows all about how to maintain the 
army and on what budget. 
  As to the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, Pavel Grachev 
believes it should be settled in accordance with the Massandra 
Agreement between Ukraine and Russia, according to which the 
Ukrainian part of the fleet, after an appropriate inventory, 
would be passed over to Russia. 
  [Grachev] Russia will pay suitably for leasing this part of 
the fleet, and the fleet stays unified and indivisible, as at 
present. But this is being done with a lot of difficulties. 
  Pavel Grachev read the journalists a message from Admiral 
Baltin which reports continuing acts of the Ukrainian powers 
that use special purpose troops and OMON [Special Purpose 
Militia Detachment] forces with the aim of forcing the personnel 
of the fleet to take the oath of allegiance to Ukraine.

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has warned 
against cuts in troop numbers to less than 1.9 Mn. Speaking in 
Moscow on Wednesday, he put the Army's current strength at 2.3 
Mn which is to be reduced by 200,000 this year. 
  Grachev said that a lack of financing was the main problem 
facing the Army at the moment. He said that the 
government-proposed military spending of only 46-47 percent of 
what was needed would make it impossible not only to implement 
Army reform, but also to maintain its combat readiness. Grachev 
spoke of wanting to fight for additional resources, stressing 
that both Yeltsin and the prime minister were well aware of the 
Army's problems. 
  The minister is unhappy over the implementation of the 
Russian-brokered ceasefire agreement for Nagorno-Karabakh that 
Armenia and Azerbaijan signed in Moscow. He blamed the setback 
largely on Baku. Grachev also spoke of having refused to meet 
the Armenian and Azeri defence chiefs arriving in Moscow on 
Tuesday until the two sides complied with the ceasefire 
agreement, which he described as a fair one. 
  The minister said he was supportive of the Partnership for 
Peace concept though Russia worked out its own parameters for 
participation. Unlike East European countries, he said, Russia 
has no plans of joining NATO, preferring closer cooperation with 
it instead.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Pelts: "Army Carries Out Its Tasks </F>
Despite All the Difficulties and Problems"] 
  [Text] Yesterday Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian 
defense minister, held a routine press hour for Russian and 
foreign journalists. According to established tradition, at the 
start of the discussion he briefed journalists on what has 
happened in the Russian Armed Forces since their last meeting. 
We would remind you that this took place late in December 1993. 
  First, the defense minister stressed that the process of 
reform is continuing in the troops in accordance with the plans 
and tasks set out in the president's Message to the Federal 
Assembly. There have been systematic moves to improve the 
system of command and control, create new groupings of troops 
and mobile forces, improve the system of Army and Navy staffing, 
and equip them with the requisite hardware and arms. The 
defense minister singled out a few of the most important areas 
of Armed Forces reform. Primarily, he stressed, the system of 
military legislation has continued to be fine-tuned. The 
Defense Ministry has already prepared over 20 draft laws. 
Drafts of new laws -- "On Martial Law" and "On the Military 
Militia" -- are also being formulated. 
  Other measures to reform the Armed Forces have gone strictly 
according to plan. The problem of reducing the numerical 
strength of troops and forces remains an important one. The 
defense minister emphasized that it has been decided following 
comprehensive analysis to propose that the strength of the Armed 
Forces be ratified at 1.9 million men. It is thought that the 
lower figure proposed previously is simply inadmissible. 
  At the beginning of the year it had also proved possible to 
overcome the negative tendency with regard to nonfulfillment of 
the draft plan. To date 88 percent of draftees (of the current 
plan) are already performing their constitutional duty in the 
Army and Navy. Toward the end of March it is intended to raise 
the draft level to 95 percent. 
  A considerable improvement has also been recorded in the 
state of troop discipline. Compared with 1993 the total number 
of crimes and violations has dropped by one-fourth. There have 
been 22 percent fewer cases of irregular relationships and 20 
percent fewer cases of draft dodging. On the whole, the defense 
minister stressed, the nature of offenses within the Army and 
Navy reflects the situation in society. 
  The defense minister voiced the greatest concern in 
connection with the problem of shaping the military budget and 
funding the Armed Forces. According to him, if the adverse 
trends continue and radical, determined measures are not taken 
in the near future, it will be impossible to speak not just 
about further reform of the Army, but even about the security of 
Russia generally. To date the Finance Ministry is providing 
less than 50 percent of the required funding to meet the needs 
and ensure the normal functioning of the Army and Navy. 
Naturally, that situation cannot suit us. The defense minister 
underlined the fact that he would continue to try to obtain the 
necessary budget for the Armed Forces. He did point out that 
even in these conditions potential does exist for obtaining 
additional funding for the troops. This potential primarily 
arises from the Defense Ministry's right to set its own targets 
and sell combat hardware itself and from its ability to sell 
surplus military property to the national economy, cut the order 
to the military-industrial complex, and also further reduce the 
Armed Forces. Naturally the fact that this plan exists does not 
mean that reform of the Army and Navy will occur in precisely 
these areas. We will not permit a wholesale reduction in the 
Army, the minister stressed, especially since that does not 
benefit the state as a whole. The defense minister went on to 
emphasize that the military budget under discussion will still 
have an explicit social thrust. The intention is to spend over 
50 percent of all budget funds, which the Defense Ministry is 
allocated on social protection for servicemen. 
  During the press conference Defense Minister Pavel Grachev 
answered numerous questions about problems of military 
cooperation with countries both near and far. In particular, he 
pointed out good prospects for cooperation with France, the 
United States, and the FRG, as well as with Belarus, Uzbekistan, 
Tajikistan, Turkmenia, and other Commonwealth countries. 
Commenting on recent events in the Black Sea Fleet, Pavel 
Grachev stressed that the current problems should not affect the 
unconditional fulfillment of the Massandra agreements and that 
he is hoping to cooperate closely with the Ukrainian defense 
minister despite certain difficulties. 
  As at previous meetings with journalists, there was no 
avoiding questions with a political slant. In particular, the 
defense minister was asked whether his current presence in 
Moscow was due to the need for a "strong hand" in the capital. 
Pavel Grachev forthrightly rejected the political slant to the 
question and stressed that the Army is engaged in performing its 
tasks.

<F P=106> [Report by Valentin Rudenko: "Russia Has Not Lost Its </F>
Markets, `Rosvooruzheniye' General Director Viktor Samoylov 
Believes"] 
  [Text] As we have already reported, the "Rosvooruzheniye" 
State Arms and Military Hardware Import-Export Company was set 
up last November in accordance with the Russian president's 
edict on the basis of the "Oboroneksport" All-Russia 
Association, the "Spetsvneshtekhnika" State Company, and the 
Main Administration for Cooperation and Production Sharing. The 
new company has now held its launch. 
  What prompted the president and the government to embark on 
the centralization of military-technical cooperation and to 
concentrate the entire Russian arms trade virtually in one pair 
of hands? First and foremost, of course, the desire to establish 
-- as is generally accepted in the entire civilized world -- a 
strict state monopoly on the export of weapons and military 
hardware. It is no secret that a situation had come about of 
late whereby state specialist exporters, in an attempt by hook 
or by crook to win the right to conclude contracts, were 
competing with each other in the foreign market and duplicating 
each other -- which, with a single producer, inevitably led to a 
dissipation of effort and dumping prices. For instance, five 
Russian specialist arms exporters tendered for a 1992 munitions 
delivery to India. They were all offering products from the 
same plant. As a result, the unit cost of the ammunition was 
knocked down from $700 to $450. 
  Or take the following example: In the space of a single year 
the Malaysian and Bangladesh defense ministers were visited by 
representatives of 24 Russian firms, who unanimously stated that 
they had exclusive rights to sell our weapons. 
  With the formation of the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, 
which is directly subordinate to the Russian president, the 
situation will change fundamentally for the better. Now all our 
foreign partners will have a clear idea of with whom they are 
dealing. 
  As for the weapons manufacturers, in the opinion of 
"Rosvooruzheniye" General Director Viktor Samoylov, their rights 
will in no way be infringed upon. As before, all major Russian 
defense enterprises will actively participate in foreign 
economic activity. Only the producers can determine what each 
country needs, what modifications to the weapons need to be made 
for each country, how best to organize servicing, and so forth. 
The state company intends to act as a representative, providing 
state monitoring, helping to process documentation, and so forth. 
  At a meeting with journalists, Viktor Samoylov stated quite 
definitely that Russia has not lost its traditional markets at 
present. The process of incorporating "Rosvooruzheniye" into 
the market has been evolutionary rather than revolutionary, and 
this has meant that it has been able to ensure complete 
continuity and to maintain all the links which the 
"Oboroneksport" All-Russia Association, the "Spetsvneshtekhnika" 
State Company, and the Main Administration for Cooperation and 
Production Sharing previously had. 
  According to forecasts from "Rosvooruzheniye" specialists, 
this year there is every reason to expect an increase rather 
than a reduction in the volume of military-technical 
cooperation. Not least in markets that are new to Russia. The 
company intends to take an important step in this direction at 
the FIDAE '94 airshow, which opens in Chile Sunday. In the 
opinion of Pavel Trishin, deputy general director of the 
"Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, our display at the exhibition 
will stand out from all the others to our advantage.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 17 Mar TASS -- The military-industrial 
complex is experiencing difficulties caused not by budgetary 
limitations but by military politics, Air Force Marshal Yevgeniy 
Shaposhnikov, the Russian president's representative at the 
Rosvooruzhenie joint stock society, said in an inteview with 
ITAR-TASS here on Thursday. 
  He explained that munitions factories now remained without 
stiff centralised administration and are subdivided into three 
self-organised systems. 
  According to Shaposhnikov, one of them is engaged in filling 
orders from the Defence Ministry and "keeps afloat with paltry 
budgetary injections." The second, numerically bigger and more 
important, is called upon "to develop new types of weaponry and 
operate with an eye to the future." 
  It is financed with budgetary leftovers and is dragging out 
beggarly existence, the marshal noted. The third, the smallest 
in talent and technical potential, sells weaponry abroad. It 
lives a lavish living. "Therefore, aspirants for foreign 
business trips are besieging this system." 
  The marshal expressed opinion that the three systems should 
be pooled into a powerful scientific and production complex to 
work on three or four conversion programmes instead of the 
present 11. 
  A specially appointed vice-premier should supervise the 
complex. "The restoration of the vertical of production 
subordination will immediately tell on labour productivity," 
Shaposhnikov claimed. 
  Consumer goods now account for 80 per cent of munitions 
factories' output. But these goods overstock their warehouses 
due to high prices and mutual non-payments. On the other hand, 
Russia lost its place on the world arms market by cutting the 
production of combat materiel. 
  The marshal suggests that Russia use the experience of 
advanced arms-manufacturing countries. For instance, the United 
States is not afraid of selling new types of weapons. It 
channels earned revenues to research and introduces advanced 
technologies. 
  Business-like Americans offer Russia surpluses of revenues 
from their arms business for its conversion programmes, removing 
thereby a potentially powerful competitor. 
  "The military-industrial complex does not need subsidies. It 
can earn huge revenues for the Russian treasury. It is only 
necessary to help it to brace for the implementation of a 
long-term programme suggested by specialists," Shaposhnikov 
concluded.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Khokhlov report under the general heading "Army </F>
Finances Sing Gloomy Songs": "Khaki-Colored Reform"] 
  [Text] There is a whole section in Boris Yeltsin's message 
to parliament "On Strengthening the Russian State" which is 
given over to an analysis of the reform in the Army and problems 
of the Armed Forces. This is nothing to be surprised at, as it 
seems that the only stabilizing force in this unsettled country, 
which is, moreover, surrounded by local conflict zones, is the 
"man armed with a gun." 
  The Russian Federation president noted that the reforms in 
the Army and Navy are going according to plan, in accordance 
with the concept of the Armed Forces' organizational development 
elaborated at the Ministry of Defense, the Russian Federation 
Law "On Defense," and the defense minister's orders. Since 
spring 1992 (after the presidential edict on creating a Russian 
Army), 11 laws and more than 100 normative legal acts have been 
elaborated and adopted. The Armed Forces' strength has been 
reduced by 457,000 men. Three military district directorates, 
eight army directorates, the army corps directorate, 19 
divisional directorates, and eight military schools have been 
disbanded. The process of reducing the number of large 
strategic formations (Army -- corps) and combined units 
(divisions), military higher educational establishments, 
scientific research institutes, and redundant command and 
control organs is continuing. 
  At the same time new structures are being formed which 
respond to the demands of the new times. Who could earlier have 
thought that the Moscow and North Caucasus Military Districts 
would have ended up on the border? Now new force groupings are 
being formed within them. However, there is every sign that the 
Armed Forces' basic structure will be preserved until 1996. 
Military experts consider this to be necessary for two reasons. 
First, they say, we have had enough "revolutions," the 
evolutionary route for the Army and Navy's reform is preferable. 
Second, the ailing Russian economy will not be able to "stand" 
a fundamental restructuring of the Armed Forces. 
  Our strategic nuclear forces continue to be the main 
guarantor of this country's security. The principle of mobile 
defense lies at the heart of the general-purpose forces' 
organizational development. The priorities for military 
technical policy have been given as the maintenance of nuclear 
security, the equipping of mobile forces, and the supplying of 
the Armed Forces with up-to-date facilities for military command 
and control, communications, intelligence, and electronic 
warfare. 
  The reforms are in general under way, moving forward, and 
expanding. We must wait and see what results they will bring. 
Informed sources in the Ministry of Defense claim that three 
things are important for the Russian Army and Navy's reform. 
First, money. Second, money. And third, money yet again. 
  Incidentally, the military budget for 1994 has not yet been 
confirmed. The monthly "rationed" injections of cash for the 
Army are practically speaking only being used for wages and 
plugging "holes"....

  [Text] Not everyone knows that under a Russian Federation 
Government directive the former closed city of Arzamas-16 was 
given the official geographical name of Kremlev City at the 
beginning of this year. It is here, in Nizhnyy Novgorod Oblast, 
that the Russian Federation nuclear center is located, and it is 
here that its honorable scientific leader, Academician Yuliy 
Khariton, who recently celebrated his 90th birthday, lives. He 
was the first to be awarded the title of honored citizen of the 
city of Kremlev. 
  Other former closed and numbered cities have also received 
official names: Krasnoyarsk-26 is now Zheleznogorsk, 
Krasnoyarsk-45 is Zelenogorsk, Penza-19 -- Zarechnyy, 
Sverdlovsk-44 -- Novouralsk, Sverdlovsk-45 -- Lesnoy, Tomsk-7 -- 
Seversk, Chelyabinsk-70 -- Snezhinsk, and Zlatoust-26 -- 
Trekhgornyy. So, address your letters according to the cities' 
new names. According to data from the newspaper ATOM-PRESSA -- 
the publication for workers in Russia's nuclear power sector and 
industry -- there are over 700,000 people in former closed 
cities located on the sites of enterprises in the nuclear 
munitions complex. The largest of these -- the city which is 
now Seversk -- has over 100,000 inhabitants. 
  Right now, the production units located in these cities are 
experiencing enormous difficulties. The size of the state order 
has fallen sharply, insufficient budget funds are being 
allocated to implement conversion programs, and there is a delay 
in paying workers' wages. The sector also has its share of 
unemployed -- over 3,000 people are receiving unemployment 
benefit.

  [Text] A high-ranking official from the Ukrainian State 
Committee for Nuclear Energy, Viktor Stovbun, has told 
INTERFAX-Ukraine that Moscow's shipments of nuclear fuel for 
Ukrainian nuclear power stations are unrelated to the withdrawal 
of warheads. 
  He said the supplies are provided for by an agreement 
between 
the State Committee and the Russian TVEL corporation signed at 
the end of last year. Ukraine paid 6.79 Bn rubles for the fuel 
immediately. 
  According to Stovbun, at the end of last year the capacity 
of 
the Chernobyl nuclear power station had to be cut down due to 
fuel shortages, but at the end of February the State Committee 
purchased Russian fuel for a quarter of a year. At the 
beginning of 1994 Ukraine received the first batch of nuclear 
fuel. 
  At the same time Kiev has drawn attention to the fact that 
Russia has not signed an agreement on fuel supplies to Ukraine 
in exchange for the withdrawal of nuclear warheads from its 
territory which is provided for by the treaty between Russia, 
Ukraine and the USA. The Ukrainian vice-premier Valeriy Shmarov 
has told INTERFAX that they only received a letter from Viktor 
Chernomyrdin in which the Russian side pledged to begin 
shipments this month. 
  The State Committee believes that as Ukraine has a 
sufficient 
number of nuclear installations, it would be more profitable to 
develop the production of nuclear fuel in the country itself 
than import it. In this connection the State Committee is 
preparing for an international tender of technology for the 
production of nuclear fuel.

  [Text] Almaty March 16 TASS -- Kazakhstan's state 
delegation headed by Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko set off 
on Wednesday for a working visit to Moscow. The visit aims to 
pave the way for the proposed Kazakh-Russian summit. Under an 
earlier agreeement, the delegation is scheduled to meet for 
talks with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and 
cabinet members to discuss a wide range of issues of mutual 
concern. 
  These issues can be grouped into four sets, which are of 
especial importance to further development of bilateral 
relations, a spokesman for the Kazakh prime minister reported. 
The two sides will consider military and military-technical 
cooperation, operation of the Baykonur space launching site, 
peaceful use of atomic energy, improvement of ties in the 
economic, scientific, cultural and law spheres. The same 
problems are to be discussed by Presidents Boris Yeltsin of 
Russia and Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan during their 
summit scheduled for late March.

  [Text] Tallinn, March 16 -- Inter-state negotiations 
between Estonia and Russia have not been broken off at all, head 
of the Russian delegation Ambassador Vasiliy Svirin told ETA, on 
Wednesday [16 March], adding that it was "strange to hear that 
they were broken and now will resume." 
  During the last round of negotiations on March 1-2 at 
Lohusalu resort near Tallinn, Russia withdraw its earlier 
commitment to pull out its forces by August 31, 1994 and 
neglected to offer another date for negotiations. Yesterday the 
Foreign Ministry of Estonia announced that Estonia had accepted 
Russia's offer to resume negotiations despite "numerous and 
often vague statements from the Russian part on breaking off the 
negotiations". 
  Svirin said that at the last round of negotiations "new, 
unexpected moments came up" and the Russian side had to think 
the situation over" to work out their position. [quotation marks 
as received] 
  The next round will be held in Moscow on April 5-6. 
  Commenting on the possible Estonian-Russian summit, Svirin 
said that it was extremely important, but declined to enlarge on 
the topic, saying only that it had to be prepared very 
thoroughly in order it to be "epochal" in the difficult 
relations between Estonia and Russia.

  [Excerpt] The ink on the agreements initialled by the 
Latvian and Russian delegations had not dried yet in Moscow, 
when the relevant departments here in Latvia had cause to be 
alarmed. Another provocation was averted near Skrunda. 
  The executive of the Latvian National Independence Movement 
[LNNK] expressed its opinion on this today in a statement for 
the press. Mirdza Vitola reports on the statement. 
  [Vitola] The package of interstate agreements initialled at 
the talks between the Latvian and Russian delegations -- which 
provides guarantees for the military personnel of the Russian 
occupation army, who were discharged before 28 January 1992, to 
stay in Latvia and which offers the possibility of aspiring for 
citizenship, as well as provides for the keeping of the Skrunda 
radar station in Latvia for five and one half years -- means 
securing the legal status of the Latvian occupation and of its 
consequences. 
  The government delegation has acted against the interests of 
Latvian citizens and of their unequivocally expressed will. The 
treaty has been drafted in secrecy, without familiarizing the 
public with its conditions. The LNNK categorically demands the 
immediate publication of the full texts of all the agreements in 
the press and considers that the action by the government and 
its delegation should be qualified as an act of betrayal of the 
state interests of the Republic of Latvia. 
  First, the LNNK calls on the president of the Republic of 
Latvia not to sign agreements with Russia. Second, it calls on 
all Saeima deputies who are able to realize the tragic and fatal 
meaning of these agreements for the future of the Latvian state 
and people, not to ratify it. Third, it calls on all Latvian 
citizens and political forces who feel responsible for Latvia's 
future and independence to become involved in protest actions 
with the aim of stopping the ratification of these agreements. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Studio announcer] And now some details about the incident 
itself. Yesterday evening, the Kuldiga district police defused 
an explosive device which had been placed by the concrete base 
of a pylon carrying a high-tension power supply line 
approximately 1 kilometer from the check point of the Skrunda 
radar station. This information has been supplied to the BALTIC 
NEWS SERVICE by Ilgonis Heinackis, head of the Kuldiga district 
police department. 
  The Latvian Interior Ministry Press Center reports that the 
device was made up of approximately 12 kilograms of TNT -- in 
200- gram briquettes and divided into two batches -- an 
electrical detonator, wires, a timing device, and a battery. 
  The district police was informed about the explosive device 
by a resident of Ranki rural district. The command of the 
Russian army unit stationed at Skrunda refused to take part in 
defusing the device.

  [Text] Virgilijus Bulovas, the head of Lithuania's working

that the next round of talks between Russia and Lithuania will 
take place in Moscow on 21-22 March. Despite the fact that the 
previous meeting of the delegations was held in September 1993, 
Bulovas said that the Russian-Lithuanian negotiations were going 
well. The sides agreed that the main volume of work was to be 
done at a level of groups of experts. Bulovas said that the 
list of issues that were to be discussed at the new round of 
talks was not yet finalized. However, he believes that the 
discussion is likely to focus on border crossing and travel from 
one state to another. These problems were discussed at last 
week's meeting of groups of experts.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- Armed men in military 
uniforms seized the mayor's office of the Russian far east port 
city of Vladivostok early Thursday [17 March], detaining Mayor 
Viktor Cherepkov, the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY reported. 
  ITAR-TASS quoted the city's deputy mayor as saying he has 
appealed for help to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  In a report monitored in Tokyo, ITAR-TASS also quoted the 
deputy mayor as saying, "there are no legitimate authorities in 
the city now." 
  The mayor's office identified the armed men in uniform as 
"elite OMON [Special Purpose Militia Detachment] policemen," who 
reportedly were acting on instructions from the deputy governor 
of the maritime region. 
  The dispatch, without mentioning the identity of its source, 
carried a commentary saying the events resulted from a 
"protracted conflict between the mayor and the regional 
authorities." 
  The news agency again quoted the mayor's office, without 
naming the actual person who made the allegation, as saying that 
Cherepkov had a heart attack on Wednesday, prompting his doctors 
to urge him to stay in bed. 
  It said the alleged OMON police could not interrogate the 
mayor, while the mayor's lawyer was not allowed to meet his 
client.

  [Text] At its closed session Wednesday [16 March] the 
Federation Council started to discuss the situation in the zone 
of the state of emergency on the territories of North Ossetia 
and Ingushetia. 
  The Federation Council's commission which has visited the 
conflict zone put forward a proposal to expand the state of 
emergency over the entire territory of North Ossetia. At 
present the state of emergency has been introduced only on a 
part of North Ossetia's and Ingushetia's territories. 
  North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov disagreed with 
this proposal and declared that "the commission has not even 
tried to penetrate the essence of this problem." The Federation 
Council can promote the conflict settlement "if its resolution 
does not become another negative and illegal link in the chain 
of decisions adopted earlier," he said in his interview with 
journalists. Among these "illegal decisions" Galazov mentioned 
the decree on rehabilitation of the repressed peoples and the 
decree on the creation of the Ingush republic which, as he 
believes, actually legalizes the territorial re-division. 
  During his conversation with journalists Ingush President 
Ruslan Aushev supported the recommendations of the Federation 
Council Commission on introduction of the state of emergency on 
the territory of North Ossetia. He also does not rule out the 
possibility of such a measure as establishing presidential rule 
in the conflict zone.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1725 GMT on 16 March carries the 10-minute "Details" 
program, presented by Sergey Dorenko. The program carries brief 
recorded interviews with some opposition figures at unspecified 
locations. 
  The presenter begins by noting that there will be opposition 
rallies in Moscow's Theater Square on 17 March. He says that the 
exact number of militia and internal troops who will be assigned 
for crowd control is a military secret, "but there will be 
enough." Dorenko adds, however, that the militia are demoralized 
by the recent amnesty decision: "They risked their lives during 
such operations; the criminals then walked free." 
  There follow telephone interviews with former Vice President 
Aleksandr Rutskoy and Communist Party chairman Gennadiy 
Zyuganov, who criticize the rallies as pointless and state that 
they have no involvement with them. Zyuganov says that the 
situation could get out of control and play into the hands of 
provocateurs. 
  Dorenko notes that opposition leaders fear the rally more 
than the government; he says they are already applying enough 
pressure on Yeltsin and do not need street fights to put them in 
power. 
  He goes on: "From contact with all the opposition leaders we 
gained the impression today that they are all terribly afraid of 
something." 
  Sergey Baburin, leader of the Russian Popular Alliance, then 
appears. He says: "I am, of course, put on my guard both by the 
fact that the defense minister postponed his trip to St. 
Petersburg and by the fact that the president hastily went off 
to Sochi. This all indicates that there may be surprises in 
store, but not from those who are conducting the rally." 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia (LDPR), is shown. He says: "Troop movements are 
thought to be taking place nevertheless and a scenario, as it 
were, is being worked out: under the pretext of eliminating the 
consequences of inspired and provoked mass disorder -- for 
example, a group of armed bandits attacks a group of traders, 
over 200 fatalities, blood -- under the pretext of putting an 
end to massive disorder, a state of emergency is declared in the 
city and, accordingly, there may be restrictions on political 
freedoms." 
  Mikhail Astafyev, leader of the Cadet Party, says that only 
the country's present leadership need a crisis on the streets. 
Members of the opposition want power to come to them by the due 
process of politics, but the authorities are whipping up tension 
by practising military manoeuvres. 
  Dorenko resumes: "Today deputies of all the colours in the 
rainbow, from Russia's Choice to the LDPR, came up to us and 
talked about a failed attempt yesterday at a coup in Russia with 
the ousting of the president and his dismissal from power. 
Deputies link this with the immediate hospitalization of 
counterintelligence chief Stepashin right after his conversation 
with the president. Among the heroes of the defense of the 
president, they name Yakovlev, head of the Ostankino TV company, 
and General Korzhakov. Whether or not these rumors are true or 
not, they characterize the atmosphere in some power structures." 
  Dorenko goes on to say: "A considerable section of the 
opposition feels very strong. It is sure that power is just 
about to fall into its hands. Yet they fear that power will be 
seized from them by the power structures and by the economic 
elite, which will take over the country together with Yeltsin or 
without him. The opposition is aware that it is weaker than its 
competitors and is even doing its utmost to defend the 
president." 
  Zhirinovskiy next says: "It's a purely Russian scenario. The 
president is supposed to be ill or on vacation. It's Foros-2. A 
good scenario: he's on vacation, he doesn't know anything. If 
disorders occur, democracy is curtailed. If everything is okay, 
he is protected and gets fuller powers. If things are bad, he 
is protected and punishes those who were unable to do anything. 
That's it -- maybe that's all it takes. We've had October 91 
and October 93. Why not March 94?" 
  Dorenko concluded the program by saying: "All schemes and 
schedules for the future carving of power are based on the 
assumption that the president is seriously ill. Incidentally, 
we know from our sources that, on 6 March this year, President 
Yeltsin had a thorough medical check-up, including an 
investigation of his kidneys and cerebral blood circulation. 
Our sources say that the president feels, at least, no worse 
than two years ago. We trust our sources. But you, of course, 
are not obliged to trust them at all until you are given the 
details by the president's physician."

  [Text] Moscow March 18 TASS -- Russian military experts do 
not rule out a possiblity that the Iranian C-130 plane which 
crashed near Stepanakert in Nagorno-Karabakh late on Thursday 
[17 March] had been shot down by a mobile antiaircraft missile. 
  The depressurised plane was flying at a low altitude and 
might have been mistaken for an alien craft by the warring sides 
in the enclave, the experts told ITAR-TASS on Friday. 
  They added that there are enough weapons in the combat zone, 
including the "Stinger" missiles, capable of destroying 
low-altitude targets. 
  Experts said their fears are also based on the fact that 
contact with the plane was lost all of a sudden and parts of the 
craft discovered on the ground show that the explosion had 
occurred in the air. 
  Such character of damages "happens after a strike of an 
anti- 
aircraft missile," experts said. 
  They also said it is necessary to find out why the plane had 
deviated from the pre-set route. 
  The experts categorically denied a possibility that the 
plane 
was going to land in stepanakert as the runway there is too 
short for such a class of aircraft. The crew undoubtedly knew 
about that, they added.

  [Text] Moscow March 18 TASS -- The reason for the crash of 
an Iranian C-130 military aircraft whose debris were found this 
morning near Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh, is cockpit 
depressurization, well-informed sources told ITAR-TASS today. 
  Judging by radio talks of the crew and the air traffic 
controllers, a possibility of the plane's shot down in the 
Karabakh skies is minimum. 
  The C-130 plane, an analogue of the U.S. Hercules or the 
Russian AN-12, belongs to the Iranian Defence Ministry. It came 
to Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport several days ago to bring 52 
Iranian servicemen studying in Moscow. On Wednesday [16 March] 
the plane was expected to leave for Tehran, but the take off was 
delayed till Thursday night. 
  The plane finally took off at 18:40 on March 17 carrying 32 
passengers, including 19 family members of staffers of the 
Iranian Embassy in Moscow, and 13 crew members, and headed for 
Tehran. 
  However, flying at a height of 6,300 meters at 19:54 the 
crew 
commander got in touch with the Petrovskoye separate homing 
radio station and said the plane's cockpit had turned 
depressurized and they are losing height. Some time later he 
reported that their height is 5,100 meters. 
  The crew commander had an impression that the situation 
improved and climbed the height of 6,300 meters again. At that 
time an Aeroflot plane was flying in the opposite direction on 
its way from Iran. 
  The Iranian plane commander informed the Russian colleague 
he 
had a permission to cross the Russian and Armenian state 
borders. The conversation registered in the area of the Dzhulfe 
populated locality was the last. After that the Iranian 
military plane lost contact with the air traffic controllers and 
the flying aircraft. 
  Smoking debris of the Iranian plane and 32 dead bodies were 
found early this morning four kilometers away from Stepanakert. 
  The Iranian side has requested assistance in the air crash 
investigation from the Sheremetyevo international services and 
asked local bodies not to touch the debris.

<F P=106> [Michael Bond report: "Europe Alert Over Threat of Nuclear </F>
Terrorism"] 
  [Text] London -- Security forces in both western and 
eastern Europe are combining their efforts to tackle the growing 
menace of nuclear smuggling from countries of the former Soviet 
Union -- described by Nato as one of the greatest threats to 
international security since the end of the Cold War. 
  Interpol, the international police agency, has now set up a 
specialised group, involving police forces in 24 European 
nations, THE EUROPEAN has learnt. Border guards and Customs 
officers in Poland, the Czech Republic, Ukraine and Sweden have 
been equipped with radiation detectors and are being taught how 
to handle radioactive substances. 
  A senior Interpol officer, Hiroaki Takizawa, based at Lyon, 
said: "There is growing concern in European countries about 
nuclear smuggling. Our main problem is the lack of information. 
This is a new sort of crime -- we do not yet know who is 
smuggling the material, who is buying it, and why." 
  Nuclear smuggling has become an increasingly lucrative 
business for professional dealers, but for the couriers and 
those who steal the material it is a dangerous -- even lethal -- 
game. Several have been caught carrying highly radioactive 
metals in their shirt pockets or strapped to their bodies. A 
Polish man died after carrying plutonium powder to Germany in 
his navel. "Most of the thieves are cowboys," said one 
investigator working in Moscow. "They have no idea they are 
dealing with highly dangerous substances." 
  Police in Germany, the country most commonly used to smuggle 
the material into the West, have registered nearly 350 cases of 
the illegal export of plutonium and other radioactive substances 
from the former Soviet Union in the past two years. They blame 
the burgeoning trade on falling security standards at former 
Soviet nuclear installations. 
  Interpol says radioactive material has been stolen from a 
vast range of sources. Russian authorities themselves have 
reported that during 1993 there were 900 attempts to gain 
illegal entry to nuclear installations, and a further 700 cases 
of workers trying to smuggle out materials. An investigator 
based in Moscow said: "There are wild rumours in Russia that it 
is possible to make money out of anything if it is radioactive. 
People are stealing from everywhere from waste dumps to medical 
laboratories." 
  Though there is no evidence that any nuclear substances have 
fallen into the hands of terrorists, and much of the stolen 
material would be useless for making weapons, a leaked report 
completed earlier this year by the German secret service 
identified potential customers. These included "two extremist 
Islamic fundamentalist groups". 
  It said there were "credible intelligence indications that 
high- ranking persons in ministries, embassies, industrial firms 
and research facilities" in eastern Europe were involved in 
nuclear smuggling. 
  The dismantling of nuclear arms in Russia and Ukraine over 
the next decade will produce a surplus of about 50 tonnes of 
virtually pure weapons-grade plutonium. Security officials fear 
some of this will fall into the hands of a rogue government or 
terrorist group, but they also point out that many other types 
of nuclear material can be lethal in the wrong hands. 
  Interpol is treating 30 nuclear smuggling cases as extremely 
serious but this could be just "the tip of the iceberg". Among 
cases being investigated are: 
  1. 250kg of uranium taken from a plant at Glazov. 
  2. 123 grammes of uranium stolen from Chernobyl nuclear 
power plant by an employee last October. 
  3. 260 lead boxes containing several hundred grammes of 
uranium from Kazakhstan. Six Ukrainians were arrested with them 
on the Moldovan border in December. In the capital of Moldova a 
lawyer was awaiting the delivery, for which he was due to pay 
$1.2 million. This uranium was 80 per cent enriched -- virtually 
weapons-grade. It takes just 7kg of weapons-grade material to 
make a nuclear bomb.

  [Text] St. Petersburg, 18 Mar -- The fourth plenary sitting 
of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly opens today in the 
Tauride Palace in the city on the Neva. 
  There are several main issues on the preliminary agenda for 
the sitting: a list of recommendatory legislative enactments 
regulating economic relations within the framework of an 
Economic Union; drawing up legislative enactments for the fight 
against organized crime in the CIS; drawing up recommendations 
on a single educational space and on enhancing the social status 
of students, research, and doctoral students. The question of 
the role of the Assembly in strengthening the Commonwealth may 
also be considered. 
  Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Council of the 
Interparliamentary Assembly and head of the Russian Federation 
Council, has arrived in order to attend the sitting.

  [Text] St. Petersburg March 18 TASS -- The Council of the 
CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, meeting in St. Petersburg on 
Friday [18 March], could not reach a decision on the proposal, 
"on the unacceptability of implementing a blockade against 
member-countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States." As 
a result, the assembly's plenary session opened one hour later 
than scheduled. 
  Chairman of the assembly's council Vladimir Shumeyko 
reported 
that the delegations "could not achieve a consensus concerning 
one of the items in the agenda," noting that he "would not want 
to spread any information about the reasons for the 
disagreement." 
  The representatives of the delegations from Armenia and 
Azerbaijan had entirely opposite opinions concerning the 
proposal. Therefore, the participants of the plenary meeting 
decided to ask the delegation heads to converse with their 
colleagues during the break and decide if it is worthwhile to 
leave the blockade issue in the agenda for the assembly's 
current session. 
  Shumeyko expressed his opinion that everybody understands 
how 
difficult it is to resolve such questions. He said the assembly 
members had agreed to continue work on the blockade proposal and 
introduce it during the assembly's next meeting.

  [Text] St. Petersburg March 18 TASS -- Commonwealth 
Interparliamentary Assembly Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko called on 
member countries to work out the Commonwealth's social charter 
to provide protection and guarantees to Commonwealth citizens in 
the social and labor sphere and supervise the fulfillment of 
interstate accords. 
  He said a social charter is needed to supplement the 
agreement on the economic alliance designed to offset the burden 
of ruptured economic links inside the former Soviet Union which 
was "built like one huge factory." 
  Shumeyko, who urged the search for new forms of cooperation 
within the Commonwealth in the cultural, economic, political and 
military fields, said a new legal infrastructure was needed to 
remove barriers from the path of economic and financial 
cooperation.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Pelts: "Who Pays for Peace Mission?"] </F>
  [Text] Hopes of a speedy peaceful political settlement in 
Tajikistan have proved unjustified on this occasion too. The 
talks between the Tajikistan official authorities and the armed 
opposition have been deferred. Nor did the recent meeting of 
foreign ministers of Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and 
Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] during which a desperate attempt was made 
to set up the dialogue broken off after the murder of Tajik Vice 
Premier Moyensho Nazarshoyev produce the expected results. 
Incidentally, Nazarshoyev should have headed the government 
delegation. 
  Naturally these unreassuring results in no way mean an end 
to 
attempts to set up the negotiations process with the opposition. 
But, as Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stressed in Dushanbe 
after meeting with his counterparts from the Central Asian 
states, "...it is still too early to say when these efforts will 
produce results and it will be possible to hold talks." 
  Seeking the culprits in this situation is a complex matter. 
But some mass media seem to have been very successful here. 
And, in accusing both the official authorities and the 
opposition, they cite new culprits -- the military. Those 
Russian servicemen who for two years now have been risking their 
lives to "hold" the Tajik-Afghan border and fulfilling their 
peacekeeping mission within the collective peacekeeping forces. 
Frankly, it is hard to think of anything more absurd. 
Moreover, stories have appeared that the "military lobby" is 
allegedly using every effort to try to acquire the status of 
peacekeeping forces under UN auspices in order to acquire 
certain benefits.... 
  Please, good gentlemen! The Russian 201st motorized rifle 
division deployed in Tajikistan (nearly 6,000 men) has in fact 
for two years been performing peacekeeping functions without 
this status. We shall not list these functions -- KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA has been writing of them constantly since the very start 
of the civil war in Tajikistan. Other central newspapers also 
regularly report the complex situation of the Russian servicemen 
who have found themselves at the epicenter of bloody events. 
  That is the first point. The second is that of the 16,000 
Russian servicemen now serving in what are called trouble spots 
only 1,200 (in the former Yugoslavia) have the official status 
of peacekeeping forces. The others are as they say "simply 
serving under fire." Expenditure on their maintenance and 
backup has recently increased by a factor of 10-15 as was 
reported 16 March at a press conference by Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev. And the money for this is found from the already 
meager military budget. As a result many military programs, 
primarily social programs, are being disrupted. Less housing is 
being construction, the defense complex is in a fevered state, 
and there is a lack of money for the most essential things for 
the troops' normal functioning.... 
  As for the further development of events in Tajikistan 
itself, it may boldly be asserted that there is still a long way 
to go until peace and calm there. Politicians, the Foreign 
Ministry assured us, will do everything possible to ensure that 
talks with the opposition take place. The military, come what 
may, will ensure the conditions without which these talks are 
not possible at all.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 18 TASS (ITAR-TASS) -- ROSSIYSKIYE 
VESTI opens up with a series of items under the general headline 
"A search for accord in Russian society is now really threatened 
by political ambitions, mutual distrust, and double morality". 
  Mikhail Lapshin, leader of the Agrarian Party of Russia, 
assures, for example, that the party will participate in the 
elaboration of a memorandum of civil peace but will raise a lot 
of questions. In particular, about the revival of the Russian 
countryside and will see to it in every way that "accord would 
not lead to a suppression of part of society". 
  Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, 
said he visualises the way to civil accord only in the 
attainment of agreement between the two branches of power -- 
executive and legislative -- and not in some single document, 
however complete it is and whatever the number of parties 
signing it. 
  TRUD comments on Thursday's [17 March] remarks made by Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin at the Federation council session, 
quoting him as saying that "we do not need a state of emergency 
in the economy" which is fully controlled by both the president 
of Russia and the government. 
  The newspaper's opinion is that if the measures mentioned by 
the Russian premier are implemented (namely, a solution to 
defaults of payments, a selective support of enterprises, 
restructuring, etc.) "the country will stand real chances to get 
out of the crisis." 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA on the problem of non-payments. 
  Vladimir Chumakov, general director of the Yugtransgaz 
state-run enterprise, states that "defaults of payments are our 
sore point now. More than 60 per cent of the amount of sold gas 
has not been paid for." 
  Such a financial reality, Chumakov said, "deforms our 
economic, technical and social policies". In order to remove 
the cause of the economic disorganisation, he pleads the need to 
revise, first of all, the taxation policy and to determine a 
reform policy in a clear-cut manner "so that people and 
enterprises would know the direction we proceed along." 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA singles out a report that Boris Shurinov, 
vice- president of the UFOlogy union, has accused a number of 
servicemen from the Russian Defence Ministry of "clandestine 
sales" of information on the UFO problem from secret archives to 
the Americans. Next week the newspaper promises to give details 
of the russian "UFO-gate". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) on Pavel Grachev-William Perry 
meeting: 
  "A fundamentally new relationship -- businesslike, partner's 
and mutually respectful -- is taking shape between the two great 
powers. They are imbued not with chill but with business 
efficiency which is undoubtedly devoid of certain original 
enthusiasm which marked the turn of the decade". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Russia's 
former prosecutor-general Aleksey Kazannik who asserts that "the 
incumbent authorities lack moral principles" and that "selfish 
interests are predominating among them". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the start of overt confrontation 
between Presidents Yuriy Meshkov of the Crimea and President 
Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, who cancelled Meshkov's decree about 
an autonomy referendum. 
  "This balancing on the verge of a precipice may also easily 
lead to an aggravation of Russo-Ukrainian relations and turn the 
Crimea from an increasingly costly health resort into a hotbed 
of civil war". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Gennadiy 
Voronin, deputy chairman of the Russian state committee for the 
defence industry, who warns that Russia runs the risk of "losing 
the status of great power" and emphasises that "the duty of the 
Russian state is to save its navy". 
  PRAVDA gives prominence to the text of an address to the 
citizens of Russia by the leaders of the left-centre opposition 
who call on people to unite in order to "prevent a final breakup 
of historical Russia and the disruption of cultural, economic 
and political relationships that took shape for centuries 
between its equal peoples".

<F P=106> [Report by Vitaliy Tsygankov: "First Constitution of </F>
Independent State Passed. Opposition and Majority Differ on 
Republic's Fundamental Law"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Zenon Poznyak, leader of the 
parliamentary opposition Belarus National Front, commenting in 
an exclusive interview to your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent 
on the adoption of the Constitution, stated: "This Constitution 
has been passed only to introduce a presidential system designed 
for one specific person, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich; and 
for one political action, presidential elections. Other than 
this, the Constitution is not going to work in a normal way; 
neither will the presidential system of government, because it 
does not provide for balanced relations between local 
authorities and the Supreme Soviet, between the president and 
the Supreme Soviet, between the executive and judicial powers. 
The Constitution has been designed to suit a totalitarian 
regime and the specific figure of Kebich, who actually has the 
Supreme Soviet in his hands now. It is designed to give Kebich 
absolute power in a legitimate way. Should another president 
come along, he would not be able to do anything in this 
unbalanced system, and would be drawn into conflict with the 
Supreme Soviet and local authorities. 
  Members of the parliamentary majority naturally see the 
adoption of the Constitution quite differently. Nikolay 
Skorigin, adviser to the prime minister and coordinator of the 
most influential "Belarus" parliamentary group, referred in an 
interview for your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent to the 
above accusations: "This is simply ridiculous. How could the 
Constitution have been designed over two and a half years for 
one person? All the more so because no one can be dead sure of 
who is going to be elected first president of the Republic of 
Belarus." 
  "From the legal point of view, the passing of the 
Constitution is a foundation for the state's entire legal base, 
and from the political point of view, it is a legal guarantee of 
ensuring stability in the state. We have managed to cross the 
Rubicon from the old Constitution, which was a brake on creating 
a rule-of-law state, to the new Constitution without a single 
drop of blood having been shed. This is a great victory for 
what seems to be a virtually inefficient parliament." This is 
the opinion of Dmitriy Bulakhov, chairman of the parliamentary 
commission on legislation. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] At the 13th session of the Supreme Soviet of the 
Republic of Belarus -- our special correspondent Mikhail 
Rutkowski reports: 
  [Rutkowski] At the beginning of the sitting, the Chairman of 
the Supreme Soviet, Myacheslaw Gryb, announced a sad event. 
Last night People's Deputy of the Republic of Belarus, Iosif 
Fyodaravich Vashkevich, died suddenly. He had been working as 
chief of management of the republic's Council of Ministers. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Chairman of the Supreme Soviet proposed considering the 
question of elections of the President of the Republic of 
Belarus. A report on this question was delivered by the chairman 
of the standing commission for state construction, Uladzimir 
Lewchyk. Here is an excerpt from his speech: 
  [Begin Lewchyk recording] As for the time limit for the 
collection of signatures, the commission within the framework of 
time for preparing the holding of elections of the president has 
tried to make these time limits as long as possible. They are 
20 days, including time for forming the initiative group. The 
mechanism for collection of signatures (?in many ways) 
corresponds to the mechanism for collecting signatures for 
holding a referendum. In accordance with the Constitution of the 
Republic -- which was passed -- elections for the president are 
held using two rounds of voting. The candidate who receives 
more than half the votes of electors participating in the 
election is considered elected president. Elections are 
considered to have taken place if more than half of the 
registered voters participate. The second round of the 
elections is also conducted according to these rules, with the 
two candidates receiving the greatest number of votes in the 
first round. The draft law envisions the possibility of holding 
repeat elections for the president if none of the candidates is 
elected on the first or second round of voting, or in the event 
of the elections being recognized as not having taken place or 
invalid. According to preliminary estimates of the Central 
Electoral Commission, the presidential elections will cost us 
116 billion rubles. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Starikevich: "Belarus: Emergency </F>
Situation as Means of Managing Economy"] 
  [Text] "Daylight robbery" is how Belarusian businessmen 
assessed the actions of Kebich's cabinet, with regard to 
commercial structures. Finding itself in a grave situation, the 
government has found a way out in confiscating currency funds 
from economic players. 
  On 5 March, the Belarusian Council of Ministers issued a 
decree "on emergency measures for the Republic to reduce debts 
to the Russian Federation for gas and other energy carriers." 
In accordance with this document, 20 percent of funds in freely 
convertible currency and Russian rubles are being deducted from 
the accounts of all enterprises. It is characteristic that the 
accounts of Belarusian economic players in both republican and 
foreign banks are being cleaned out. This action is reticently 
referred to in the decree as "hiring for a period of three 
months under government guarantee." 
  But those were only the first flowers. On 11 March, the 
government published an addition to this decree. Now all 
enterprises, including joint ventures, must hand over their 
March profit in freely convertible currency and Russian rubles 
to state currency funds. The Council of Minister kindly 
promises to compensate for losses in Belarusian rubles at the 
Republic's national bank's exchange rate of 2 February 1944. 
The comrades from the government were obviously modest in 
selecting that date. Why not set 7 November 1917 as the starting 
point (or rather reckoning point)? 
  The arbitrary cessation of trading at the interbank currency 
exchange until 1 April was the logical continuation of the 
Council of Ministers' actions. Now, determining the exchange 
rate for foreign currencies against the Belarusian ruble is the 
exclusive prerogative of the Republic's national bank. 
  Although the government's actions are invested with 
outwardly 
legal forms, this alters nothing. Essentially, it is a case of 
the nationalization of a substantial proportion of the funds 
belonging to commercial structures. It is not difficult to 
predict where this will lead. 
  "We are almost guaranteed a couple of suicides," Mikhail 
Shevelzon, vice president of the Belarus union of entrepreneurs, 
believes. "People will simply be unable to settle their debts. 
If the state cannot pay its debts, a specific businessmen is 
obliged to be answerable in any situation. In addition, 
according to my calculations, about 70 percent of Belarusian 
enterprises' capital is already working outside the republic. 
As a result of the government's actions, this figure will 
obviously grow. The situation that has taken shape will also 
undoubtedly affect foreign investments." 
  Naturally, the Belarusian Government does not want to 
demonstrate so graphically to Russia, with whom it actually 
intends to unite, but the Minsk bureaucrats obviously do not 
understand that in our case the exchange is only a reflection of 
several other processes. In particular, according to the figures 
of the BELORUSSKAYA DELOVAYA GAZETA, 2.3 trillion rubles in 
unsupported credits were earmarked in January-February to 
subsidize agricultural enterprises, to cover the budget deficit, 
and for some other purposes, which is nearly twice last year's 
emission. Now, agrarian experts are demanding a further 6 
trillion. But the government seems to believe that unification 
will write off everything and the Belarusian bureaucrats will 
yet again be able to enter paradise on the Russians' backs. 
  Over the weekend the cash dollar exchange rate rose from 
8,500 to 11,000 Belarusian rubles. Comment is superfluous. 
Meanwhile, it emerged that the World Bank credit intended to 
support the Belarusian ruble exchange rate had been given out by 
the government to pay directly for energy carriers. This was 
announced by Stanislav Bogdankevich at a conference of the 
National Bank leadership and chairman of the boards of 
commercial banks. This fact will hardly give rise to a positive 
response among international financial circles. 
  The Belarusian Government is deceiving not only Western 
bankers, but also its own fellow citizens. In February, from 
the platform of the Supreme Soviet Vyacheslav Kebich swore that 
there would be no increase in prices for basic foodstuffs before 
the unification of the monetary systems. But on Saturday a loaf 
of bread was sold in stores for 300 rubles instead of Friday's 
price of 120 rubles. 
  To avoid undesirable consequences, the government announced 
in advance that as of 1 April (we will have a good laugh then) 
the minimum wage will be raised from 30,000 to 60,000 rubles. 
In this case, it is appropriate to ask: Where is the money 
coming from? Are we going on a spree at Russia's expense again? 
  What is happening today is only the start of the collapse. 
The Belarusian noose has been coiling long enough, but the 
finale has nonetheless arrived. A natural finale. 
  So far, it is unclear how exactly the union of entrepreneurs 
will react to the Council of Ministers' March decrees. Perhaps 
it will adopt a tough stance, but it will hardly be able to 
influence the government. 
  On the other hand, the businessmen themselves have already 
drawn the necessary conclusions. A leader of a large commercial 
structure who wishes to remain anonymous ("I may still have to 
work in this country") told an IZVESTIYA correspondent: "No one 
intends to feed this government. Any normal economic player 
will stop showing his currency profit. This is robbery. The 
nomenklatura undertook this step out of despair: The 
incompetents from the ranks of former party members are simply 
incapable of anything else. Now they have one commodity left 
that they can sell -- sovereignty -- and the status of a 
province in the Russian empire suits them very well." 
  The government has made its move, but what next? Let us 
allow that it succeeds at least partly in extinguishing the debt 
for energy carriers. But given the present state of the 
Belarusian economy, in a couple of months everything will be the 
way it was before, and then what? I very much doubt that 
entrepreneurs will give the Council of Ministers the opportunity 
to rob them again. 
  Alas, it looks as though the principle "if we can last the 
day we can hold out for the night" is prevailing in Kebich's 
cabinet. As before, the desired unification of monetary systems 
is looming. But even if this dubious measure does take place, 
will the prime minister's team survive until then? 
  It is no accident that the currency exchange auctions have 
been repealed. Their cessation was preceded by a scandal at the 
last auctions, which was held 10 March. Some 40 minutes before 
they started, representatives of the National Bank, citing a 
letter from the bank's chairman, Stnbislav Bogdankevich, 
demanded that currency purchasers supply copies of the contracts 
for purchasing goods abroad. No one had heard a word beforehand 
about the chief banker's message and so entirely naturally no 
one had the documents. After lengthy disputes, the auction 
began, but after the dollar exchange rate had risen from 9,120 
to 12,200 Belarusian rubles the results of the auction were 
simply revoked. To avoid such undesirable figures in future, the 
auctions were simply canceled. For three weeks for the time 
being but it is by no means certain the exchange will resume 
work 1 April.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Nekrasova] </F>
  [Text] Lvov, 17 March TASS -- According to the 
Constitution, "the Ukrainian president has the right to abrogate 
acts taken by executive bodies of the Crimean Republic (eds: the 
Crimea is a constituent part of Ukraine). The abrogation of 
Yuriy Meshkov's (eds: Meshkov is president of the Crimea) decree 
of 10 March is the first step in this direction," said Ivan 
Timchenko, head of the Ukrainian president's legal service, 
explaining Leonid Kravchuk's decisons over national television 
on Thursday. 
  He dwelt at length on the background of these events. The 
Crimean Republic adopted its Constitution on 6 May 1992 where 
Article 9 read: Relations between Ukraine and the Crimean 
Republic are based on treaties and agreements. 
  Article 17 granted Crimean citizens the right to have dual 
citizenship to be determined by treaties between the Crimea and 
other states. However, the above was in contradiction with the 
Ukrainian Constitution. 
  Therefore, the Ukrainian parliament proposed that the Crimea 
bring these and other articles in line with the Ukrainian 
Constitution. Such a decision was taken by the Crimean 
parliament on September 25, 1992. 
  Article 9 now reads that relations between Ukraine and its 
subjects are based on legislative acts and agreements. "The 
question of dual citizenship was the competence only of the 
Ukrainian parliament," Timchenko stressed. 
  The lawyer noted that the decree by the Crimean Republic 
president says about a public poll on whether there is any need 
for restoring these articles of the Constitution, although such 
questions are the competence of the Crimean parliament. 
  The preamble of Meshkov's decree runs that the poll will be 
held to study the will of Crimean citizens and to take decisions 
important for the Republic. 
  Timchenko claims that "in actual fact, a decision was taken 
to hold a consultative referendum" under the pretext of a public 
opinion poll. "This was the reason for Kravchuk to repeal items 
1 and 2 of the above decree's Article 2," the lawyer stressed. 
  The Crimean central Electoral Commission held its meeting in 
Simferopol on Wednesday and discussed Meshkov's address. The 
Crimean president accused the commission of "unwillingness to 
organise this poll and of usurping the role of a constitutional 
court." The commission responded with a protest.

  [Text] Kiev has no intention of subjugating the Crimean 
president to the Ukrainian president, but the president of the 
Crimea will have to act in accordance with Ukrainian laws, 
Leonid Kravchuk told a news conference in Kiev on Thursday. 
  "If the Crimean president fails to understand this and 
begins 
to demonstrate his power or exceed Ukraine's laws and 
Constitution, this will pose the start of confrontation. The 
entire responsibility for it will lie on the person who starts 
it," Kravchuk declared. 
  Nevertheless, Kravchuk pointed out that "we shall not resort 
to the use of force toward the Crimea." He is "calling for 
common sense," the Ukrainian president said. 
  "The Crimea continues to receive subsidies from Ukraine," 
Kravchuk noted, and added that "there is no political 
independence without economic freedom." 
  According to him, the issue of dual citizenship, that was to 
be decided by referendum in the Crimea, "is within the 
competence of Ukraine and Russia, not that of the Crimea." 
  During his first meeting with Yuriy Meshkov, Kravchuk said, 
he reached agreement to come into contact when working out 
political decisions. "Evidently there are forces which directed 
the Crimean president to a different road," Kravchuk said. 
  "If some people think that they will become a state as soon 
as they proclaim it, they are deeply mistaken," he said. The 
Ukrainian president referred to the experience of 
Trans-Dniester, which, he said, "proclaimed itself a state, but 
failed to become one in practical terms."

  [Text] The press service of the president of Crimea issued 
a statement today in connection with the 12 March 1994 
resolution by the Central Electoral Commission on the elections 
to the Supreme Council of the Crimea Republic. The statement 
indicates that in his decree "On Conducting a Poll Among the 
Citizens of the Crimea Republic on 27 March," President Yuriy 
Meshkov was guided by the electors' will and also took into 
account the refusal of the Supreme Council of Crimea to lift a 
moratorium on holding an all-Crimean referendum. 
  In setting the date of the poll, the president was guided by 
the fact that with the assistance of the Central Electoral 
Commission, significant organizational and material losses could 
be avoided in the course of conducting the poll and electing 
deputies to the Supreme Council of Crimea. The document 
underlines that the president will continue taking into account 
the Crimea citizens' will while solving the most important state 
issues.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Ukraine has announced its intention of devaluing the 
karbovanets in the near future without introducing a floating 
exchange rate based on market dealings. Valentyn Landyk, the 
Republic's deputy prime minister told INTERFAX that the Cabinet 
of Ministers held a special conference devoted to the formation 
of a currency rate policy. The conference did not produce a 
final agreement on a mechanism for currency regulation. 
However, it is expected that a decision on this will be taken 
in the next few days. 
  The exchange rate for cash karbovantsy at exchange points at 
present is about 40,000 to the dollar. The official rate is 
used by the state to purchase half of the foreign currency 
incomes of exporters and other payments. At the end of 1993, 
inflation in Ukraine was over 60 percent per month but in 
January it fell below 20 percent.

  [Text] Almaty, 17 March TASS -- Kazakhstan has summed up 
final results of its parliamentary elections held on March [as 
received]. 
  The central electoral commission has announced that 73.52 
[as 
received] of all eligible voters took part in the polls, 
electing 176 people (154 men and 22 women) to sit in the 
parliament. 
  As concerns ethnic backgrounds, the new parliamentarians 
consist of 105 Kazakhs, 49 Russians, 10 Ukrainians, three 
Germans, three Jews, one Uzbek, one Tatar, one Korean, one Pole, 
and one Uigur. 
  Forty-two people were elected from the state list, 75 were 
nominated by public associations and 59 were self-nominated. 
  According to independent analysts, at least 60 per cent of 
the newly-elected parliamentarians are reliable supporters of 
Nursultan Nazarbayev, and they will therefore be able to control 
the majority in line with Nazarbyaev's wishes.

  [Text] The prime ministers of Russia and Kazakhstan held a 
working meeting today. They discussed issues concerning 
bilateral economic cooperation, dual citizenship, and the use of 
the Baykonur cosmodrome. 
  It has become known that there will be no obstacles for the 
citizens of Kazakhstan to receive temporary citizenship in 
Russia and to change it when they return to Kazakhstan. 
  As for Baykonur, it can be handed over to Russia after 
signing a lease treaty. The price remains the only point issue. 
In addition, the prime minister of Kazakhstan said it that was 
also necessary to resolve ecological problems when using the 
cosmodrome. Ecological compensation should be defined. As of 
today, the financing of Baykonur remains the main issue. As for 
its technical safety, one should not worry about this. 
Accommodation for families of Russian officers and servicing 
personnel on Kazakhstan territory will also not pose a problem. 
  [Begin Tereshchenko recording] The programs that are to be 
implemented on Baykonur demand large investments. Presently, 
there are not enough of them either from Russia or Kazakhstan.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 17/3/1994 -- President Mircea 
Snegur took the floor during the signing ceremony of the 
"Partnership For Peace" Document, in Brussels on 16 March. He 
noted that being in a very important geo-strategic zone at the 
intersection of numerous interests, by the help of the program 
the Republic of Moldova will strive for consolidation of peace 
and good will and for the solution of the various and 
complicated problems it presently faces, based on international 
principles and rights. "We are also ready to elaborate as soon 
as possible the document of attendance for the signing of the 
bilateral agreement of partnership that will define the 
character and degree of Moldova's cooperation with corresponding 
NATO structures," said Snegur. He declared that Moldova is 
interested in an effective participation in the program, "with 
the certainty that it will offer us favorable opportunities for 
the creation of a professional army, in accordance with 
requirements, democratic principles and international 
standards." Mircea Snegur stressed that the Republic of Moldova 
pays special attention to the consultations on security 
stipulated by the program, especially in the case when a member 
state deems its territorial integrity, political independence or 
national security threatened. According to President Snegur, 
"today these principles are violated by the presence of foreign 
troops on Moldovan territory. This fact is in our opinion the 
biggest obstacle for the final political solution of the 
conflict in Moldova's Eastern regions."

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 17/3/1994 -- At the end of his 
visit to Belgium, President Mircea Snegur had yesterday a 
meeting with Van Eekelen, secretary general of the Union of 
Western Europe [WEU], the presidential spokesman said. Van 
Eekelen told Snegur about the structures of WEU and its 
purposes, the most important of which is to maintain peace and 
security in Europe. Discussing the relationship between WEU and 
Central and Eastern European states, the secretary general said 
that nine states have joined the WEU, but with remaining states 
bilateral relationship can be developed. President Snegur 
estimated, in his turn, that with the adherence to the 
"Partnership For Peace" program for insuring a total security 
the signing of a partnership agreement with WEU would be 
welcome. Snegur said that the 14th Army has to retreat 
unconditionally from Moldova's territory and that WEU military 
observers are welcome in Moldova's Eastern regions to eliminate 
suspicion and consolidate the confidence of Moldova's population 
in the constitutional organs' actions, the source notes.

  [Text] Kyrgyzstan will evidently refrain from joining 
NATO's Partnership for Peace program, said the chief of the 
international department of the president's office, Bakit 
Abdrisayev, in an interview with INTERFAX. 
  According to Askar Akayev's expert on world politics, the 
possibility of his country's joining the program is being 
studied, and "the approach to it is very cautious," since 
Bishkek is bound by its commitments in the framework of 
collective security treaties signed with CIS countries. 
  As INTERFAX learned from the chief of the Kyrgyz Defence 
Ministry's press center, Lt.-Colonel Akzhal Isayev, his ministry 
has not determined its attitude to the NATO program yet, since 
the military are not acquainted with it.

"Ashgabat Refuses To Sell Ukraine's Debt to `Avtovazbank.' 
Neither Does the Latter's Initiative Meet With Support in Kiev"] 
  [Text] The POSTFACTUM news agency has learned from sources 
close to the government of Turkmenistan that Republic Vice Prime 
Minister Valeriy Otchertsov, in charge of financial matters, has 
declined to meet with Avtovaz president Petr Nakhmanovich, who 
has arrived in Ashgabat. Other high Turkmen officials also 
ignored the invitation for a meeting. P. Nakhmanovich's trip is 
known to be connected with Avtovazbank's intention to buy 
Ukraine's debt to Turkmenistan for gas deliveries that stands 
today at $800 million. 
  Abad Kurbanmuradova, head of the trade department of 
Turkmenistan's cabinet, said in a POSTFACTUM interview regarding 
this that the question of Ukraine's settling its debt for 
Turkmen gas imports would be solved with the participation of 
the Ukrainian "Republic" corporation through which many 
Ukrainian enterprises effect economic relations with Turkmen 
enterprises. It is supposed that 30 percent of the debt will be 
paid to Turkmenistan in hard currency right away, while the 
balance will be paid in commodities in the course of 1994. 
Turkmen authorities have already agreed to carry out this 
project. Now it has been sent to the Ukrainian Government for 
approval. This information is also being confirmed in Kiev. 
The Ukrainian side declares that there have been no talks 
between Ukraine and Turkmenistan on reselling the debt. 
  Thus, Avtovazbank's initiative has won no backing and only 
caused bewilderment in the capitals of both states. POSTFACTUM 
reports that according to a confidential source, no Avtovazbank 
chiefs had consulted Ukrainian authorities on the matter, and 
the Republic would have hardly opted for such a step anyway.

  [Text] The Russian and Armenian Governments signed an 
agreement in Moscow today on the demothballing and industrial 
repair of the Armenian nuclear power plant [ANPP]. 
  According to the signed agreement, the sides will jointly 
inspect the basic equipment of ANPP, [words indistinct], restore 
its operations up to the trial stage, and implement additional 
safety measures. Joint work will also be carried out to bring 
the plant to the start-up level, and to train the technical 
staff. 
  The Russian side is carrying out the engineering-technical 
work to prepare the ANPP for renewed operation and industrial 
use, and is supplying the nuclear fuel. It is also helping set 
up organs that will supervise the operation, organization, and 
nuclear radiation safety at the ANPP; structures that would 
supervise the organization of nuclear power production in 
Armenia; and an appropriate system to control and account for 
the nuclear material. It is also drafting formal and technical 
documents. 
  The Armenian side will adopt the Russian Federation's 
regulations and laws on nuclear plant safety. It will assume 
responsibility for the physical protection of the Armenian 
nuclear plant. 
  The agreement also envisages a number other points: 
Specifically, the sides will not impose custom duties on 
(?equipment) and goods needed for the demothballing and the 
industrial restoral of the ANPP, and will ensure unimpeded 
travel for the specialists working in the plant and for their 
families. 
  The Armenian side guaranteed that the nuclear material it 
receives, the nuclear and non-nuclear materials derived from it 
or produced from its use, and the apparatus and equipment it 
obtains will not be used for the production of the nuclear arms 
or other nuclear explosive devises, or for any other military 
purposes. 
  The Russian Federation's Atomic Energy Ministry, and Russian 
Supervisory Board for Nuclear Radiation Safety, the Armenian 
Fuel and Energy Ministry, and the Armenian Council of Minister's 
State Directorate for the Supervision of Nuclear Energy will be 
responsible for the implementation of the agreement. 
  The Agreement was signed by Armenian Prime Minister Grant 
Bagratyan and the Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg 
Soskovets. 
  Armenian Deputy Prime Minister Vigen Chitechyan; Eduard 
Yegoryan, a member of the Armenian Supreme Council Presidium; 
the Armenian permanent representative in Russia Feliks 
Mamikonyan, and other officials were present at the signing 
ceremony. 
  In reply to reporters' questions after the signing ceremony, 
Grant Bagraytan and Oleg Soskovets assessed the significance of 
the agreement in strengthening and broadening the economic ties 
between the CIS countries, particularly between Armenia and 
Russia. 
  The Armenian prime minister described the agreement as a 
major step toward solving Armenia's energy problems.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Qulu Meherremov] </F>
  [Text] The mass media have described the meeting between 
the chairmen of the parliaments of Azerbaijan and Armenia as an 
important development in the effort to establish peace between 
the two republics. First, I wish to comment on the military and 
political factors that have created that viewpoint and paved the 
way for a better atmosphere in the region. It seems that 
Armenia's effort to deploy reinforcements at the front lines 
after losing many men in Azerbaijan's counterattacks during the 
past two months, the strengthening opposition in that republic 
against the war, and the decrease in the foreign aid Yerevan has 
received have undermined Armenia's plans to find a military 
solution to the dispute. Meanwhile, the intensified activity in 
Azerbaijan's foreign policy, the relations established between 
Azerbaijan and several countries that have supported Armenia, 
and the strengthening possibility that the recent political 
initiatives in the world on Abkhaziya and Bosnia may be 
broadened to cover the dispute in the Caucasus can be regarded 
as one of the reasons that has prompted the chairman of 
Armenia's parliament to urge his counterpart in Azerbaijan to 
agree to hold talks. 
  Of course, Russia's anxiety in its foreign policy on what 
Armenia's situation will be in the battlefields and the 
Transcaucasus in general if the inclination in the world for an 
agreement strengthens has had a significant bearing on the 
meeting of the two officials. 
  What is the difference between the talks held by the 
chairmen 
of the two parliaments and the meeting the deputy chairmen of 
the parliaments of Azerbaijan and Armenia held through Russia's 
mediation in 1993? The political nature of the talks clarifies 
that matter. It is true that Azerbaijan's anxiety and 
conviction that Armenia may resort to deceitful activities is 
justified. However, the fact that the meeting between the two 
chairmen has been realized as a result of that republic's 
initiative has, in one way or another, clarified the question as 
to which country has lost its potential in maintaining the war. 
  Meanwhile, the talks and the principles and conditions that 
were agreed on, and which were also discussed during the 
meeting, have indicated Armenia's new political inclinations in 
its approach on the war in Karabakh, which was kindled by that 
republic. If that meeting has been the outcome of a sincere 
approach in Armenia's diplomacy, an approach that can hardly be 
expected from that republic, then it can be regarded as an 
indication that Yerevan may make an effort to contribute toward 
the solution of the problem. Obviously, holding high-level talks 
between Azerbaijan and Armenia will be possible if, as the 
chairmen of the two parliaments have agreed, a strong guarantee 
is given for the withdrawal of the Armenian Armed Forces from 
the occupied territories in Azerbaijan. The high-level talks 
will also facilitate the realization of the other measures that 
the two chairmen have agreed on. 
  Naturally, the intensive talks with Armenia will expose the 
claims made by the Armenians in Karabakh, regardless of the 
effort that has been made to present them as a side to the 
problem. They will also facilitate the realization of the 
conditions the chairmen of the two parliaments have agreed on, 
reactivate the UN resolutions on the dispute, and pave the way 
for the return of hundreds of thousands of people to their homes. 
  Undoubtedly, one of the important tasks of Azerbaijan's 
diplomats is to take political and legal measures on the 
hope-inspiring provisions of the agreement between the two 
sides, which are still on paper.

dispute between the two republics. 
  Dzhelilov recalled that the Interparliamentary Council's 
previous session was briefed by the republic's delegation on the 
dispute and Azerbaijan's approach; and he stressed that the 
republic's representatives will reiterate Azerbaijan's position 
on the peaceful settlement of the dispute when the Council meets 
on 18 March. Azerbaijan's position has already been explained by 
the republic's leaders several times. 
  The journalists were informed that the Interparliamentary 
Council's permanent committees deliberated on economic and 
financial issues, protection of the environment, social 
policies, and other matters a few days ago. They also set the 
agenda of the Council. Dzhelilov said that several 
representatives from the Azerbaijan National Assembly attended 
the permanent committee meetings. He also said that the 
republic's delegation has made plans to hold talks with the 
parliamentary representatives of the Russian Federation,
